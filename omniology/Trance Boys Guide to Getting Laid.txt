Closing - the kiss close and the number close
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation
The #close 
The conversation with the girl is going well, but eventually it has to end. Either she has to go or you have to go or you just feel 
you can't keep it up at the same heights anymore and need to stop before you stall. So what are the best ways closing? (A close by 
the way is not a "Bye, it was nice meeting you", you'll have to extract something out of your interaction with the girl, either her 
phone-number, a promise for a new meeting, a kiss, better yet - all of those things:). Here are a few examples. 
Example 1 
You: "Why don't we continue this somewhere else and see how much we can enjoy each other's company?" 
In response she might offer a change of venue (if she mumbles "your place or mine?", then boy! either she's real easy or you're 
real good:), but more probably she's gonna offer a phone number so the two of you can set up a meeting later over the phone. 
Notice, that you didn't ASK for her phone number, it was her idea to give it to you, thus framing you in her mind very differently 
from when you would have asked for the number. The first instance creates in her mind a picture of "I gave him my number… 
which must mean I like him" while the second creates an opposite picture of "He asked for my number…. which must mean he 
likes me… yawn, yeah he's nice, next!":) 
Example 2 
You: "So..what steps would we have to take in order to make sure we can talk again?" If a change of venue is highly unlikely, this 
one is a more direct wake-up call for her to usher you her number. 
Example 3 
You: "I have an intuition… and I don't know if you can imagine this as I describe it… that when we get a chance to talk without 
time pressures or interruptions… we'll really enjoy each other's company… and I'm wondering if there's a number where you feel 
comfortable having me call you?" 
Example 4 
"Let's do xxx together. I'll call you"
"But you don't have my number!"
"Oh that's right! (pull out a pen)" 
Example 5 
An example of Mystery's #close (the girl is already quite eager though and the #close is a formality, but beautifully handled 
nevertheless:): "Well, when we go blading you have to wear your gear cause I love the hills." She nods so I add, "for this to 
happen you have to ask me a question." She blurts out, "can I have your #?" I say, "wow you come on strong! Are you always this

How to Lay Girls Guide
bold?" She says, "yes" I act "impressed" and say, "how bout we trade #s ... fair?". 
Update. A variation of the above. Mystery, Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: 
You: "Well... now that we've set up a meeting, there's a question you need to ask me." 
Girl: "What?" 
You: "Oh come on!" 
Girl: "What's your phone number?" 
Update. Example 6 
(Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...":) "Just abruptly look at your watch if you're wearing one, or if you don't have one 
ask for the time right in the middle of your conversation. Once you get the time make up an excuse that you have to go right away. 
Be polite and tell her how much you enjoyed this conversation and that it was your pleasure to meet someone like her and walk 
away. 
Just as she will be all confused about what is going on, wondering if she said something to offend you or if perhaps you don't like 
her because you didn't ask her out or you didn't even ask for her phone number, come back as though you forgot something and 
say: 
"You know what? If we ever wanted to do this again, and laugh and have a good time together we don't even know how to get a 
hold of each other. And that would be such a tragedy. It would be a definite loss for me, but perhaps if you think about it and 
realize how much you enjoy having intriguing conversations, laughing and having a good time, you will know that it would be a 
loss for you too. So, what do you figure we should do about it?" 
The answer is obvious. But if she doesn't offer you her phone number right now while you still maintain this sense of urgency as 
you have to leave, ask her for it directly." 
Update. Example 7 
If however you don't have the time / can't come up with anything to construct a situation for her to offer you her number, or you 
have offered all sorts of opportunities ("So what should we do in order for us to be able to continue this discussion some other 
time?" "Um... I dunno?") but she just doesn't take the hint - ask for her number directly. 
G     "I don't mean to be direct, but can I have your phone number." 
G     "You can't leave...You haven't given me your phone number yet!" 
G     "Give me your number", then hand a pen and a notebook (that simple?:). 
Update. Example 8 
Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): "You should say "I think you're a great girl and I think we would get along really well. 
Now if I didn't come and talk with you, which may seem a bit cocky, we would never get to know each other, so the best thing for 
me to do was to come and ask you out. You can't knock that now can you?" 
Wait for her reply which will almost definitely be in agreeance with you and then say: "How about not organising anything now, 
but give me your phone number and it will give you some time to think about it and me some time to plan something for us". 
Now don't stand around waiting for her to give you some long winded answer as to why or why not she will do this. You need to 
keep your presentation going by assuming she will give her number to you. You must ask for her number then and there as though 
you expect to get it from her. Even if you don't have a pen and paper ask for her number and then remember it. Ask her if it is in 
the phone-book in case you forget it and then ask what it would be under. 
You have already explained why she should give her number to you and also given her the option in her mind that even if you 
ring she can still say no to you. Now that you have done this you need to focus on the phone number and it will take her mind

away from a yes or no answer in regards to a date. Actually, whether she realises it or not, she really has just said to you she will 
go out with you. She may not even realise this at the moment as you have given her the option that even when you ring she can 
say "no", but when it comes to that, she is more or less guaranteed not to decline." 
Refining the close 
(originally suggested by Mystery) When you do the #close, don't just trade numbers, accompany it with a humorous "But when I 
call you, I don't want you to answer "Huh? Who? Ah… its you… ee… so… howzit going…", I want you to act really enthusiastic 
and happy, like "Oh, you called! God I'm so glad!!", ok? Is that a deal?:)" This ends the close on a very light, friendly and positive 
note plus automatically kick-starts the phone call on that very same note:) Additionally you can end the phone call in the same 
manner: "So when we meet, I want you to smile, give me a big warm friendly hug and take my hand:) Deal:)?" End the phone call 
and start the meeting with these and you'll have removed many an obstacle from your path to being one with the girl:) 
Update. A line to use when exchanging phone numbers. Mystery, Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: "Is our relationship going be 
romantic? ...because... I like romance!" 
Update. (Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...":) "Whether you are going to call her or vice versa, make sure that you set up 
a date and time for the call. Don't just say that you'll get in touch sometime soon. Set an exact time for [calling]." 
Update. Mystery, ASF: "I will suggest something to do together when I'm closing. I will lead them to give me their # and during 
that time suggest that the # exchange will lead to more than just the roller blading or whatever we wanted to do together. 
When I call, I tell them I have some stuff to take care of and I want her to keep me company - I then get some stuff done with 
them and go for a quick bite and talk in the car and drop by a friends house and do some little things. No date." 
Update. Mystery and Rick, Clifford's Seduciton Newsletter: 
"(when a girl is in a rush) 
"I understand you're in a hurry... I'm in a hurry as well... But what a lot of people don't understand is that time constraints are an 
illusion... I mean... you don't HAVE to leave right now... There will be another cab (or something else, depending on the 
situation)... Let's finish this (exchange numbers)."" 
Update. Maxim (http://maximmag.com): 
“The best thing he can do is try to make a date off of our common interests. If we were talking about golf, ‘We should go to a 
driving range sometime’ is a great thing to say. It’s not like the pressure of a date, more like you’re sports companions. If I want 
to see you, I’ll pick up on your invite. 
—Phoebe, 32, Westport, Conn. 
Politeness is always a good thing. A simple handshake and ‘I enjoyed meeting you, I’d love to talk to you again,’ with a 
suggestion of a specific exhibition or a show to see is great. That would make me feel like a guy has it together. 
—Aimee, 26, Berkeley, Calif. 
If all of a guy’s friends are leaving and he stays behind to talk to you, there’s suddenly a lot of pressure on. He should always 
leave with his friends. He can simply say he doesn’t want to ditch them, then ask if he can call me. He comes off like a good pal 
and not just someone on the make. 
—Diana, 24, New York City” 
Whenever possible though, aim for the *close, the #close will follow naturally plus it'll have much more meaning for the both of 
you:) 
The *close 
If you can read body-language fairly well, you'll know when the girl is receptive or ready or even waiting for a kiss close:) She'll 
let you touch her without resistance, touches you in return, wets her lips slightly and/or looks at your lips, especially when you are 
aobut to depart (be observat though, they're doing it subconsciously and generally don't want to let you in on their already aroused 
little fantasies about you:).

But there are a number of situations, where things are not that clear, you're not sure if she is in the mood or things have not been 
too going well etc. The dumbest thing to do here is to leave without actually finding out ("Ok, bye now, was nice meeting you"), 
this applies even if you did the #close ("Ok, well, I'll call you…" etc). Of course, you have to pick your situations - for example 
you can't start asking for a *close in front of her friends or relatives (she might even be dying to kiss you, but she just can't do it in 
front of others - that's why extracting her / separating her from the others is so important) - but you should always aim for the 
*close nevertheless. 
Don't use a "Can I kiss you?" line - its indicative of your supplicating tendencies and puts her too much on a pedestal from which 
its easy for her to reject you. Instead, use the Mystery-style "Would you like to kiss me:)?" and go for the kiss if the response is 
anything but a blatant "NO!". Don't expect a "yes", you'll hardly ever get it (but if you did, you can fairly safely assume the same 
answer to a "would you like to make love to me?":). But the lack of an outright refusal ("I don't know…") usually means that she 
really would like to kiss you, but she's just processing the situation as kissing has both social and personal implications and she's 
not quite ready or its not a comfortable place for her to do it etc, but never mind all that, say "Let's find out" and go for the kiss - 
she'll enjoy it:) If the reply however is a "NO!", then do a Mystery-style followup: "Gee, you sure wrecked a moment, I bet your 
previous BFs must have really hated that about you..." Its a good neg to make her re-evaluate her position and usually you will be 
able to proceed with her the next time you try (note the importance of persistence here!:). 
Update. Veroxii, ASF: "After doing some fluff-talk with a girl and getting some rapport and light kino going, I ask her if she likes 
local or foreign guys better, because I prefer foreign girls over local girls (which is a lie!:). Then after her "But why?" I tell her it's 
because local girls don't know how to kiss properly. I think you guys can see where I'm going with this... After a little bit of an 
argument (because they actually do kiss quite well), I just grab her and say "so let's find out!" and give her the full tongue action. 
Sidenote: you need to have at least some kino going before this, or she might freak out." 
Update. SirMoby, ASF: "I always ask the HBs "Do you like ice cream?" Of course they say "Yes" and ask "Why do you ask?" I 
explain that women that don't like ice cream probably kiss with their mouth closed and that the women of [insert the homeland of 
the HB here] seem to have no passion. They immediately come back about how passionate they are. I usually get an open mouth 
kiss in a few minutes and they also start telling me about their passions.

You're probably wondering, what the heck is an Estonian translation:) Well, I've just translated a few patterning dialogues into 
Estonian, my native language, so that they'd be a little more useful for me (no use talking in English to an Estonian girl is there?:). 
If however you're a fellow Estonian as well and would like to get your hands on them, here are the terms (the following is in 
Estonian).

Proceeding instead of closing
Back to the Table of Contents
A very viable alternative to closing is simply proceeding. If both you and her seem to have some time to spare and things are 
going well, why would you literally want to "close" a wonderful thing? To leave her wanting for more? To work some more 
magic over the phone and build up anticipation, incredible connection and attraction? Sure, but none of this compares to being 
able to make things happen right now. And if there seem to be no unsurmountable obstacles, then that is exactly what you should 
be doing. 
The following example adapted from "Sweep women off their feet..." uses big-time supplication, but being fairly off-the-wall and 
presented as "anything to make you smile", it does the trick:) The main value of this example however is the application of 
proceeding instead of closing. 
"There is no better time to go out than right there and then. If you already spent some time talking to a girl you just met and she is 
responsive, asking her out can mean nothing more than taking the conversation somewhere else. 
[Talking with female colleagues on the street]. Just as I turn around I see this amazingly beautiful girl walking down the street 
towards us. 
I looked straight into her eyes and said: 
"You know what I think? I think it should be illegal for someone to be as beautiful as you." 
As she made her way past the three of us, she turned her head and said: 
"Who me?" as though she was trying to figure out if I was talking to her. She began to blush. 
"Yeah, you! You are going to cause an accident. At least if I was one of those guys driving down the street, I couldn't take my 
eyes off you and bump the car in front of me." 
"Nah, you're just saying that." And then she walked into the building. 
"Wait, just wait a second. Do you think that you're just going to walk into my life like that, completely blow me away with your 
beauty, style and magnetic personality and then walk away never to be seen again?" 
"Well, as sweet as you make it sound, I do have some things to take care of in this building and I have to go." 
"That's fine with me. Just tell me how long you'll be and I'll wait here for you. I won't even take another breath until you return if 
that is your wish." 
Without saying another word she went into the elevator and off she went. Five minutes later I was still out there talking to my two 
friends when she came back out of the building. I walked up to her again and said: 
"Wow, I knew that you were going to come back to me. You didn't tell me how long I should wait but I was ready to go home and 
get my tent and camp out here for as long as needed just to see you again."

She starts giggling and says: 
"What kind of girl do you think will fall for this kind of lines?" 
"Actually, if these lines can put a smile on your face, then I can die a happy man. I suppose I'm ready to die now. My dream has 
come true. I made you smile. I wonder if I can do it again. But you know this is not even funny. Usually I am a self-centered 
bastard just like any other guy, keeping my feelings to myself, then this girl walks into my life and changes everything. I start 
pouring out my inner most feelings and you think they are just some cheesy pick-up lines." (Acting hurt) 
"Somehow I just don't see you as a self-centered bastard. You're just being too hard on yourself." 
"I can prove it, but you have to spend some time with me, perhaps have a drink with me around the corner at the E&C (nice 
restaurant and sports bar)." 
"But I don't drink. Besides why would I want to really find out that you are a self-centered bastard? That's not what most girls 
want in a guy." 
"Ok, I don't drink either. We can have a couple of soft drinks. But I know that in my attempt to show you my dark side, you will 
realize how much fun you're having and I'll get yet another chance to admire your beauty. I'll even make you a deal. The minute 
you stop laughing and having a good time that's the minute that you get up and walk away. No strings attached." 
"Are you buying?" 
"I wouldn't even have it any other way." 
"Ok, you're on." 
The casual tone of the entire conversation allowed us both to laugh all throughout. 
After drinks I told her that I had plans for later in the evening because I wanted to see this movie, but I would love it even more if 
she came along. By now she was very comfortable in my company and she had no problem saying yes. At the movies we bumped 
into an old acquaintance and after introducing them he said out of the blue that we look good as a couple and that we would have 
good looking kids. As you can see, we were already acting like a couple in love, and that's how people around us perceived us. 
[well, you won't be able to count on bumping into old acquintances telling you your kids will be cute, but acting like a couple in 
love goes a long way nevertheless:)]. At the end of the evening when I took her home we kissed and said good night. We never 
even exchanged phone numbers as of yet. From earlier conversations she mentioned of her love to read and the vast collection of 
books she has. At that very moment I asked her if she had any books on love and she said yes. "Can I take a look?" We went 
upstairs and she told me to wait by the door so she can tidy up a bit before I can go in. Once I was in she showed me her books 
and gave me the one about love. I sat on the floor and told her "It says in here that love usually happens when you least expect it 
but if you're in doubt there's a little test to find out for sure." I asked her to sit next to me for the test. We kissed and I never left 
until the next morning. 
Though we spent a few hours together before this happened, the point that I'm trying to make is the fact that meeting a girl for the 
first time can turn into more than an exchange of phone numbers and a possible date down the road. In this case, having slept 
together, how hard do you think it would be to ask her out on a date? In her mind it would only be natural that we continue our 
"relationship" by going out together, and yes, more sex. But at the same time, the fact that we both had the time to talk and get to 
know each other right away was the deciding factor. If we were under time constraints and constantly interrupted, the most we 
would have accomplished would have been the exchange of numbers and perhaps another date." 
If at any time the time constraints and interruptions seem to be interfering with proceeding though, you should do the close (taken 
from "Sweep women off their feet..."): 
"It is indeed nice talking to such a wonderful person as you just about anything that can make us both laugh and feel good. But 
can you imagine how much more we could enjoy each other's company if we were in a more comfortable setting without any kind 
of time pressures or interruptions, allowing us to really explore the topics of conversation that allow us to have a good time and 
laugh the most. I think we owe ourselves at least one chance to experience that. Wouldn't it be great to experience that and let it

happen?" 
You basically asked her if she likes to have fun. Who doesn't like to have fun? From here it's easy to set a date for you to spend 
some time together."

Inviting the girl over to your place
Back to the Table of Contents
Three different scenarios of inviting a girl over to your place as either a continuation of a date or the two of you just hanging out 
together will be discussed below. 
The basic premise 
The basic premise of all these scenarios is the assumption that you have already been spending some time together that very same 
evening - either you have had a date, or met at some party (wedding, reception, birthday etc), or a nightclub/bar/pub. But now that 
the party is about to end, or the pub to close, or you're almost done with all the prescripted "dating" activities (be it movies, 
restaurants etc) - what next? 
Here are three different scenarios of proceeding for you to examine and make the right choice from. Oh, and by the way, a 
scenario of You/Her: "Thanks, I had a really great time, bye now!" will not be discussed at all, I hope you don't minds:) 
Scenario I 
Fluff talk. Facts talk. Then some more fluff talk. You steer the discussion to whatever seems to hold her interest and you know 
you have exhibits of at home - arts and literature / you have lots of books on them or paintings, statues etc; music / an records 
collection; movies / books on movies or a movies collection etc. Now you can quite casually somewhere in the dicussion mention 
"You know I have a great [book/collection] on [whatever]". And when the time comes, you can say: "Well, why don't you come 
to my place and check out [whatever] I was talking about. I could show you [this] and [that]". 
She turns you down. And this was the whole point of the first scenario. She turns you down, thus it really doesn't matter what you 
did or didn't do. The sneaking up to a cheap pretext to throw her way is just one example of the wrong way to do it. There are 
countless more and AFCs all over the world are doing it daily, failing miserably and getting laughed at by the girls behind their 
backs. 
In conclusion - she didn't even accept the invitation. 
But I'm not telling you yet, how to avoid being turned down - read the next scenario:) 
Scenario II 
Fluff talk. Feelings talk. Onto the value and personality demonstration method (aka seduction technique:) of your choice. You can 
see that you are making her feel good:) She smiles, laughs, has a puppy-face, etc, things are going well. You might even be having 
some slight kino (touching hands, maybe holding hands when walking in the streets etc). She has got to be into you:) So up comes 
the topic of going to your place, for whatever reason, could even be the lame "I'll show you this book and that record" pretext of 
the first scenario. And she agrees:) 
She comes to your place because she likes you and trusts you. But... um... well you like her and trust her too, otherwise you 
wouldn't have asked her over:) But that wasn't exactly your point:) 
Oh well, you proceed to work your magic - make her feel good, relaxed, at ease, connected etc. But sooner or later there comes a

How to Lay Girls Guide
time of revelation for her - she might be about to see more than just some book. Once she has had that revelation, she can either 
decide that she wouldn't mind that at all and in fact she would like that very much:) ...Or she might first freeze up from the shock 
and horror of the unexpectedness of that revelation, then panic and finally flee. 
In conclusion - she accepts the invitation, but there are no assurances as to whether she also decides to stay or not. 
But I'm not telling you yet, how to avoid being run away from - read the next scenario:) 
Scenario III 
Fluff talk. Feelings talk. Onto the value and personality demonstration method (aka seduction technique:) of your choice. You can 
see that you are making her feel good etc, everything starts out just like in the previous scenario. But there's modification to it - 
instead of slight kino (holding hands etc), the two of you will have much more intimate kino. That means stroking her hand, hair, 
waist, holding her and then the ultimate test - kissing. Actually kissing serves a double purpose: 
a) As already mentioned, it serves as the ultimate test - if she is reluctant to kiss you when you're hanging out, there's good chance 
she will also be reluctant to kiss you when she comes to your place. 
Kissing of course is a huge decision for a girl, so if you wan't to test her willingness to also stay in case she decides to accept your 
invitation at all, you must first make the kiss for her as comfortable as possible - you'd better have already had previous kino 
(hugging, stroking), be in a more secluded place or in a place, where she feels its ok to kiss (so this could also be in the middle of 
the dance-floor of a nightclub, where things like that occur frequently) etc. 
If she refuses a kiss, don't give up yet, see the suggestions on kiss-closes in Closing. If however she doesn't seem to want to kiss 
you, there's little chance that she'd accept your invitation as well, for now she knows what it really is she has to decide about when 
considering your invitation. You can still try of course, but I'd say that if she accepts to come to your place after having refused a 
simple kiss... you've got yourself one strange girl:) 
b) Aside from being a test of whether or not there would be any point in inviting her over, kissing also serves as a mighty 
powerful aphrodisiac. She might be willing to come to your place anyway, and she might be willing to kiss you, but she might not 
be thinking in terms of staying a bit longer than it would take to check out a few books. Having started kissing with you however 
will definetly sway her thinking in the horny direction so that she might even start thinking about doing it with you tonight 
without you ever mentioning anything about... going to your place "to check out a book or something":) But when you finally do 
that, she'll be more than happy to accept:) 
In conclusion - no turning you down, no coming over and then fleeing, but a girl who knows what to expect and expects what she 
has come to know:) And that is the kind of girl you want to "show your books" to:) 
So remember - kiss-test/arouse her first, otherwise you'll be just shooting in the dark. 
Update 
NYC's suggestions to someone whose girl was comfortable with the kino and kissing but seemed reluctant to come to his place. 
NYC and his usual graphic language, ASF: "FORGET YOUR HOUSE! If you had taken her somewhere secluded, you could 
have fucked her on the premises. She was rejecting GOING TO YOUR HOUSE... NOT you feeling her up. She was totally with it 
and you lost out because you tried to change the venue. You can lose your vibe en route to the new location, so I personally don't 
like to change venues. Do her in the bathroom if you have to."

"Always two there are... a master... and an apprentice"
(Yoda; Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace)
Well, not this time. For I certainly am no master and even if I were, I probably wouldn't have the time nor the patience needed to 
train someone to become a PUA wingman of mine. 
But for the reason of educating any present or future wingmen of mine nevertheless, and also for my own personal reference 
purposes, I started the "How to Lay Girls Guide" in January '99. It all came to be when I read an article of a journalistic 
experiment of the journalist trying to seduce Madonna during her press-conference. The journalist noted, that he went to the press-
conference virtually unprepared, not even having read the book "Speed Seduction" by some Ross Jeffries. I noted that and added 
it to my list of books to check out. The journalist failed miserably by the way:) He weighed all sorts of seductive questions in his 
mind and how to continue from that, but once it was his turn to ask a question, all he could mutter was "So.. um... er.. is it nice to 
receive awards?", to which Madonna answered "Yes", the microphone was given the next journalist and that was the end of that:) 
The journalist passed out at his hotel after the press-conference - one of the greatest field-reports I've ever read:) 
Of course, turned out that there was no specific book by the name "Speed Seduction", but what a world opened before my eyes 
after doing a few net-searches on the subject:) I just couldn't simply read and hope I'll remember, so the guide originated as a 
Word document file, into which I pasted any useful information I happened to stumble upon. After a while I decided to convert it 
to basic HTML to allow easier and faster access to the information in it. And now - I present it to you, as part of my contribution 
to our collective effort of "doing the girls right":) 
If my writing seems odd, then it probably is. First of all, I am not a native speaker and secondly, when I do speak (or write), then 
British English is my language of preference. That's why "capitalize" is actually "capitalise", "humor" "humour" and so forth, 
don't worry, you'll get used to it:) 
From having its origins as a document intended only for my personal use stems one of its greatest downfalls - the lack of due 
credits. I tried to rectify the situation as best I could before putting this guide online, but credits are still missing in various parts of 
the guide. Should you find ideas or even exact wordings here that were originally published by you on your website or on ASF 
and you would like credit for them, please contact me so I can correct the omission. 
© And, this goes without saying - all texts not falling under the copyright of others (Ross, Diebel, etc) are copyrighted by me and 
no part of it may be republished, reprinted or reproduced in any written media without my express written approval. But should 
you choose to "lift" something from this site to put on your site or print out for your own purposes (like I have so elegantly done 
with Ross' and Diebel's stuff without ever even consulting them:), I'd be grateful if you let me know about it - you'll find contact

Kinaesthetics (aka kino) - have kino with your female friends/acquaintances
Back to the Table of Contents
Psychological studies show that casual touching during a friendly conversation causes people to remember the conversation more 
fondly after the fact. 
The combination of kino with social proof is dynamite. Touch one girl and the other girls seeing this think its normal or even 
"good" to be touchy-feely with you:). Now you can quite naturally move on to touching those other girls and so forth:). 
ASF: "It's quite simple - hug them, touch their hand sporadically and in A NON THREATENING WAY, that is, not like the 
desperate pervert we all are:) So the idea is, you hide completely the interest you might have AND at the same time you act really 
touchy/huggish. The problem is - you have to start this early in the "friend" relationship, it has to seem natural, or otherwise she'll 
wonder "what the fuck is he doing lately?":) Once you've developed that kind of flirtatious friendship, it's easy to spawn other 
such 'friendships' with other women: they will see you being close to another woman, and I think the key here is that, it probably 
does not trigger as much jealousy as it makes them (the "new" ones) feel comfortable -- they see another woman being touched by 
you in a non-threatening way, and, blam, social-proof, it becomes a 'proof' to them that it's normal for you to touch them in turn... 
" 
ASF: "Ok, I use this all the time now. TOUCH HER!!! It doesn't matter if you just met her. Hold her hand, rub her arm, her elbow 
her back, her shoulders, her hair, her face. TOUCH HER !!!" 
ASF:
1. PAY ATTENTION TO HOW SHE RESPONDS TO YOU!!!
2. PAY ATTENTION TO HOW SHE RESPONDS TO YOU!!!
3. One more time: PAY ATTENTION TO HOW SHE RESPONDS TO YOU !!! If you do this you will be able to better gauge if 
you have the appropriate rapport to invite a kiss. If her body seems to respond to the non-sexual touching then get gradually more 
sexual. For women some areas of the body outside of the primary erogenous zones are intimate: Palms, inside the elbow, ear 
lobes, cheeks, the hips were the waist meets the hips, between the fingers....
4. Last thing: PAY ATTENTION TO HOW SHE RESPONDS TO YOU!!! 
Update. Do the things that lovers do - brush off "something" that's stuck in her hair, gently stroke her cheek pretending to wipe 
off an eyelash etc. These are the types of things lovers do and by doing them, you will make her feel (doesn't even matter if only 
subconsciously) like you were her lover. Plus you'll get "innocent" yet pleasurable kino:) 
Update. Kino as soon as you meet a girl. Meeting someone for the first time is an excellent chance for starting kino - shaking 
hands when exchanging names is a tradition of many cultures and cultures. But make sure you hold on to her hand longer than 
expected, long enough for you to enjoy it and her to notice, if not you enjoying it but at least you not letting go as quickly as 
people usually do. 
When meeting girls you already know, shaking hands might seem strange, so giving some sort of a hug is the way to go. You 
don't need to fall all over her to give her a hug (which depending on the situation might even make you look like a fool or a 
pervert or make her embarrassed instead of having her enjoy it too:), a hug can also be putting your arm around her waist or 
shoulders when standing to her left or right and pulling her closer for a moment, or taking her hand for a moment (but not shaking 
it), or her elbow, or arm etc. Daniel, ASF: "KINO on the arm/hand as soon as you say hi to show her you are a sexual being."

Update. Set the mood of the date from the start. When going on a date/get-together, establish the mood immediately. You can 
of course change the mood from "polite and calm" to "warm and friendly" to "aroused and sweaty" during the course of the 
meeting, but why go the hard way, if you can jump right into "warm and friendly" or beyond in the first place. It is best to have 
acting enthusiastic upon meeting the girl to have agreed upon previously (most probably when you set up a meeting on the phone, 
see Refining the close in Closing for more information). But even without that, you can be all smiles when you meet her, give her 
a big hug right away, try to take and hold her hand all the way to whereever it is that you'll be going and watch her change from 
slightly nervous to happy, smiling, starry-eyed and glowing all over:) And remember - enthusiasm is contageous:) 
Update. Foot-flirting. You've all seen it done in the movies:) The foot looses the shoe and the woman is stroking the man with 
her bare foot or vice versa. Corny you say:)? A cliche maybe:)? Try it and then see what you think:) am, ASF: "[in response to 
"you can't kino sitting across the table"] Actually, you _can_ kino when you are sitting across from the target. Just use your feet! 
Of course this requires a small table, but this also helps to set up an intimate atmoshpere (remember candles etc.). Touch her feet 
"occasionally" with your own under the table, say something like "tee hee, you are foot-flirtin' with me?" in a joking way. Look 
her deepely in the eyes while doing this, and continue using your feet. Do it the right way and at the right time with a chick in the 
right mood, and voila! You can actually proceed to rubbing each other's crotches with your toes under the table, then say "my bed 
is that way" and BANG! You're IN!" 
Update. "Can't hear you:)". LordGaeden, ASF: "Try this: If she says something, lean forward as if you aren't hearing her very 
well, and touch her (arm or back). Then lean back again and answer. Are there any easy clues as to when is the right time to go 
kino? The clue is when it's possible (ie, she's within in range)". 
Update. Kino is the difference between getting and not getting the girl. It is the saving grace of even the otherwise doomed 
"nice guy" approach. And in some instances, being the "nice guy" together with using kino can even be quite effective. Here's 
why: the success of kino depends on whether the girl perceives you and your touch as a threat to her or not. You can be a rough 
and tough guy (I try to avoid the word "jerk" as it is not really quite reprsesentative of what the opposite of "nice guy" actually is) 
and still have the girl feel you are not a threat to her speficically, thus initiating kino will be easy. A nice guy usually just has an 
easier time having girls feel he is not a threat to them. Usually though, that is also his undoing, as he is consequently perceived as 
weak, neutral and non-sexual, all of which are major turn-offs for girls. But here is where the saving grace of kino steps in. You 
are safe, so touching and hugging with you is... well, also safe. However, before she knows it - touching and hugging with you 
moves from feeling pretty good to quite exciting to really electrifying until all that good, safe and friendly physical contact with 
you is going to make her wonder: "If it feels so good just to touch with him, why on earth not do more? I wonder what that would 
be like?". Which is not to say that being the "nice guy" is the way to go. This was simply meant to illustrate the strength of 
kinaesthetics - it even works for the "nice guy":) So remember - kino really is the difference between getting and not getting the 
girl. 
Update. The protective gesture. Maxim (http://maximmag.com): “In a crowded bar, if people are walking by and pushing you, 
there’s a way a guy can put his arm around you—not actually touching you, but behind your back so he’s sort of keeping you 
from getting shoved. A man doesn’t need to pick a fight with some guy who accidentally steps on my toes, but it’s nice if he’s 
protective. —Kris, 27, Los Angeles”

Neghits explained
Back to the Table of Contents
Mystery, ASF (adapted): 
"A 10 is there surrounded by friends. She has put on this BITCH act. Is she REALLY a bitch? Unlikely. All my girlfriends were 
wonderful human beings - beautiful people have it easier because they are beautiful and often times have better upbringings 
because of it. BUT - they need to have a standard with which to uphold when all these NOBODY guys approach her. So her 
values are very honed and understood. When a man walks up and says, "can I buy you a beer?" she WILL be annoyed by this. 
While the guy thinks he's doing something nice for her, she gets this ALL the time. She is desensitised to this. You are the 8th guy 
TODAY! So she is very good at brushing all these guys off. Shit, she HAS to be... she isn't going to sleep with ALL of them! So 
she may say NO or act annoyed and then the guy thinks she's a bitch and walks off pissed and feeling like a failure. And that 
seems to work. Sometimes when the girl is particularly in a feeling of control (like in a club where she is PREPARED for the 
barrage of men - it IS after all something that occurs so often that when it is GONE she MISSES it) she will accept the beer and 
then flake the guy off. Hey, the guys are stupid enough to buy her one, she might as well take it. When they take a beer from you, 
the girl is saying to you, "I don't know you and I don't care about you. You are just another one of those typical guys and since I 
don't respect you, Ill take the beer from you before I snub you." 
Since a 10 is so GOOD at snuffing your approach (nothing ever personal either - it is a strategy that is built over years of stupid 
guys approaches EVERY FUCKING DAY, she will do the same to YOU. That is why SNUFFING THEM is important. You cant 
INSULT them because they are used to all the hurt guys INSULTING them ("ahh you are nothing but a bitch!") so this rolls off 
their back like water off a muskrats ass. How do you SNUFF them withOUT INSULTING them? Well, let's say she has long nails 
which are most likely fake. Now why do 10s dress so FINE if they don't want the attention? Because they LOVE the feeling of 
control sometimes. They are in a club with friends and they want to be the leader of the circle (social hierarchy in primates) and so 
she gets all the attention. The guys come and buy drinks for them and she gets off on knocking the guys down. Its all in a days 
play. Ok, so she is wearing fake nails to look even BETTER! Most guys will say, "wow you are so beautiful!" BORING, typical 
and in her mind by now (after years of the same shit) TRUE. Imagine a guy comes along and says "nice nails. are they real??" she 
will have to concede, "no. acrylic." and he says (like he didn't notice it was a put down "oh. (pause) well I guess they still LOOK 
good." Then he turns his back to her. What does this do to her? Well, he didn't treat her like shit and INSULT her. He 
complimented her but the result was to target her insecurity. She thinks, "IM HOT IM BEAUTIFUL (especially in that emotional 
state of control as in the public)... but I didn't win this guy over. IM SO GOOD at this. ILL just fix that little smear on my image 
that he has of me." then you continue to show disinterest in her looks as you give her a neutral topic like the Elvis script. During 
this her intention is to get you to become like all the other guys so she can feel in control and snuff you and you then give her 
another NEG HIT like this ... " is that a hair piece? well, its neat... what do you call this hairstyle? The waffle? :)" Smile and look 
at her to show her you are sincerely being funny and not insulting. You are pleasant but disinterested in her beauty. This will 
intrigue her because she KNOWS guys. And this isn't normal. You must have really high taste, or be used to girls or be married or 
something. These questions make her CURIOUS. So this keeps happening and is known as FLIRTING. She give you little neg 
hits and these tests are qualifiers. You pass them by neg hitting her back. After all, you aren't like the others showing interest. 
But... why? To get control again she says, "will you buy me a drink?" notice how she is trying to get you now! BUT, she only 
wants to sucker you in enough so she can SNUFF you. That is all she is about - this strategy is all she knows and it's not working 
for you so she is trying to do damage control on the situation. But at the same time she doesn't quite understand WHY you don't 
think you are great. After all, her nails ARE fake. You say, " ahhh, that's so funny ... you nose moves when you speak...... 
(pointing and being cute) look there it goes again ... its so... quaint ... hheeeee look " :D She'll say, "ahhh, stoppp!" :) *blush*. 
Now she is self conscious and having her in this state is where you want her. You have with 3 neg hits successfully created

INTEREST (curiosity) and removed her from her pedestal (removed her bitch shield.) You were humorous, you had a smile, you 
dress well, you are confident and everything she would want in a man. 
You didn't take her shit. OH, and when she asked you for a beer, you said, " no. I don't buy girls drinks. but you can buy ME one". 
You are qualifying HER now. If she buys you a beer, this is symbolic of her RESPECT for you. 
If not you say, "pleasure meeting you" and turn your back to her again. DONT walk away, just turn your back. You are neg hitting 
them again just when they thought she was negging YOU. That is teasing each other. That is the first step to flirting. This is all 
textbook psychology. 
A NEG HIT is a qualifier. The girl is FAILING to meet your high expectations. It's not an insult, just a judgement call on your 
part. The better looking the girl, the more aggressive you must be with using neg hits. A 10 can get 3 neg hits up front, while an 8 
only 1 or 2 over a longer time. You CAN go overboard if they think you are BETTER than them You can drop the self-esteem 
right from under them (just like most 10s do to guys) and this isn't good. You have to get as close to the breaking point as you can 
without crossing the line. Once you have gotten her RIGHT THERE, you can start appreciating things about her (NEVER 
LOOKS). There is a mutual RESPECT now. Something most guys never get from the girl. 
This is how you remove a bitch shield. 3 neg hits oughta do it within 2 or 3 minutes of neutral chat. Once it is down, you can from 
a mutual respect place, seduce her."

Neghits expansion pack
Back to the Table of Contents
H     Use negs with 9s and preferably 10s only. Don't use a neg on a 7 or 8. The 7s and 8s know what they are - cute, sweet, 
pretty etc - but not drop-dead beautiful. Their confidence in their own beauty is only fairly high and it could easily be 
destroyed by a neg. Shaking their confidence too much and making them self-conscious could quite easily make them hate 
you instead of wanting to be down with you - and that's not what you want:) The 9s and 10s however KNOW they are 
beautiful - they've been told so all their lives; and then there's always the mirror to confirm that:) So your neg will confuse 
and intrigue them and maybe even shake their confidence a little bit, but only enough for them to fall from the clouds 
(which is where many 9s and 10s spend much of their time:) to the ground (which is where you are waiting for them:) 
Compare that to falling from the ground into a deep hole, which could easily happen to a 7 or 8 should you happen to neg 
her, and you'll see, why you should be very discriminative in your use of the neg. 
H     The neg hit might backfire with a 9 or even a 10, if you use it when she's really down - in a self-defeating, self-conscious, 
"I'm probably just a 7 or a even 6" mood:) Be sensitive to her mood and if, for whatever reason, she seems to be really 
suffering, forget the neg. Be the one to bring her out of her darkness, treat her like a 6 or a 7 that she feels she is at the 
moment, meaning cheer her up and compliment her _without_ any embedded negs, but be careful - the 9 or 10 in her is 
only in suspended mode and once you re-activate it, unless you change to humorous negging right away, you'll end up 
being another supplicating chump - you get a hug and then she walks away to find herself a MAN. 
H     When you neg, ALWAYS present it as a compliment - be charming, friendly, positive, earnest and sincere in your 
"compliment":) If you present your neg as a deliberate insult you come off as a jerk (which however is a good excuse to 
"apologise" by giving her a hug and a kiss to "make up" for your insult:). Being a jerk of course could be a turn-on for 
some girls, but more often than not, it is a turn-off. Which doesn't mean that being a nice guy is your goal, in fact that's 
usually an even bigger turn-off. When you fall into the "nice" and eventually the "Let's Just Be Friends" zone, you'll wish 
you would have fallen into the "jerk" zone, that way you would at least have had some sort of a chance of doing a 
comeback. So avoid being a "jerk" or a "nice guy" - just take the best of both worlds and neg her with a "compliment":) 
H     
Example 1 of using a neghit
ASF: "When you see a HB and she snuffs you ... tell her you think her dress is very nice (something she has heard before) and 
then tell her you remember seeing her at a club before and she was wearing the same dress. It IS nice though. :) Whether or not 
you ever saw her before, you can ASSUME she HAS been social before and that she was wearing the dress before. This deflates 
her INSTANTLY and puts you in control." 
Example 2 of using a neghit
Guy: What do you do?
Gal: Oh, I'm a model.
Guy: Oh yeah, your hair looks kinda nice... / Oh, like a hand model or something? 
Example 3 of using a neghit
Mystery: "If you are in a bar and you approach a girl, she basically KNOWS you want to fuck her. You have to somehow convey 
that you didn't come for sex but because you are talkative about some even MORE interesting than HER. The only thing from you 
that can make a 10 NOTICE you is if you show her she doesn't matter to you in the slightest... that is a NEG"

Update. Examples of negging a beauty. (Only for use with 10s or 9s who simply HAVE to know they ARE beautiful, any less 
beautiful girls can easily be destroyed by these!) After you've negged her looks in some manner, follow up with: 
G     "You are really interesting, or at least you're not THAT ugly."

The 3 seconds rule
Back to the Table of Contents
Even if you really cannot think of anything to initiate a conversation with a girl, whatever you do, don't break the 3s rule! Act in 3 
seconds nevertheless, even if you have no idea, how to continue. If you act in 3 seconds, she will notice it, no matter where she 
just popped in from or where you popped in from or how you happened to pass each other by in a given geographical location. 
She will see the spontaneity in your approach and it will work in your favour. If however you wait and hesitate and then decide to 
approach, you are in a decidedly weaker situation. 
If you just arrived and accessed her in 3 seconds, she will know it was spontaneous because she noticed you arrive whether she 
wanted to or not - you were a change in a static environment. Or if she just arrived and you accessed her in 3 seconds, she will 
recognise the spontaneity of it again, because you couldn't have accessed her before - she simply had not yet arrived. If however 
you just pop out of nowhere - she didn't see you arrive neither did she just arrive and the only change in a static environment was 
you accessing her - you just might set off her stalker alarm. Who knows, how long you've been following her or watching her in 
secret or gobbling her up with your eyes. Spooky! Argh, get away you freak! So the only way to avoid a situation like that is to 
use the 3s rule. Besides not setting off any alarms of her because of the obvious spontaneity of your approach, you are also doing 
yourself a favour. In three seconds, you have no time to become sweaty, trembling, stuttering - to acquire all the sure-fire signs of 
an AFC lacking any confidence, substance or consequence, a failure with women and life in general, a complete repellent of 
beautiful girls. So even if you start sweating, stuttering and trembling while talking to you, you weren't that way when you 
initiated contact - you just didn't have the time for that. And it's the first impression that counts. And if that first impression of you 
was that of a confident and spontaneous man, her feelings for you were positive from the star, which in turns greatly the 
diminishes the chances of you turning into a plateful of jelly while having a conversation with her. 
The 3 seconds rule of course is not an absolute - you may simply not have noticed her, while not specifically being tied up with 
something that might have stopped you from approaching her, or while still noticing her, you might have been busy with 
something (or somebody:). The three seconds start counting from the moment you have spotted her AND are free to approach. 
But when these two conditions are met, you really don't have the time to ponder, whether or not SHE noticed that you didn't 
approach her because you were either too busy or simply oblivious - the clock is ticking, so move it! 
ASF: "The worst part of not using the 3s rule is when the girl sees you hesitating." 
ASF: "When approaching these chicks, I used Mystery's 3 second rule approach (which I rely on heavily) and tried to pick out 
something about them to comment on. It could be a book, something they are wearing, questions about something that they MAY 
(not necessarily DO) have knowledge on, something we have in common, whatever."

Look and feel your best, all the time
Back to the Table of Contents
To be able to talk to girls everywhere, you need to be prepared, both physically and emotionally. This means looking your best as 
often as you can, because people do meet in the oddest places, and not dragging past or present personal troubles into a new 
interaction. You need to feel great, and I don't mean confident (see On confidence), I mean GREAT - and rapport-building 
interactions with beautiful girls will happen naturally:) See also Top Colognes and Good traits to have for more details.

Talk to girls everywhere
Back to the Table of Contents
If you look and feel great, then you won't have any trouble with this. If you see a girl, looking in the window of a store, waiting 
for a bus, sitting on a train, in the next aisle of a movie, shopping in a department store, and for any reason this girl appeals to 
you, strike up a conversation, start talking to her about anything that comes to mind. With more experience - #close or *close 
right there, in the street. So set yourself a goal of talking to girls at the supermarket, laundromat, at a concert, while standing in 
line at the movie, sitting at the bar, on the bus, standing in the street, in the elevator, just anywhere and everywhere. 
Update. Taken from "Seep women off their feet...": "The most important thing for you is to talk to women everywhere, about 
anything until they no longer intimidate you. When talking to women no longer intimidates you, something special will happen. 
You will find yourself having non-threatening conversations with beautiful women all the time, and better yet, those 
conversations will naturally turn into seduction mode even without a conscious effort on your part. And once you stop thinking 
about seduction, you will find yourself just doing it. You will begin to see the change in women's behavior towards you."

On confidence and getting started with approaching girls
Back to the Table of Contents
ASF: "Try approaching every HB you see and say, "Hi. Are you the sort of person I should get to know better?" If she says 
"Yes", then ask "Why?" Put the focus of the conversation on what she has to offer you. Do this in a matter of fact way, like you 
were saying "Hi. Your shoe's untied." In fact, if you can't yet muster the boldness to confront HB's, then just tell them it looks 
like they're about to lose a heel on their shoe and WALK AWAY. Try it. It works." Don't misunderstand the "addressing a girl 
and then walking away works" part - it doesn't work for getting to know these girls, it works to add to your experience and 
feeling natural and good about approaching girls:) 
I didn't use "feeling confident" here on purpose, because ideally, you don't want to feel "confident" - being confident is 
something you think about and which ultimately reveals that you must be nervous in one way or another after all. Ideally you feel 
so good and natural about it that the word "confidence" never pops up in your mind:) Feeling so good and natural that you have 
no need to think about being confident is actually the ultimate confidence - but never think of it in terms of confidence. Forget 
the term "confidence" altogether, just concentrate on feeling good and natural (about approaching, propelling her to new heights 
of pleasure with your patterns, having kino etc) and before you know it - "confident" is how you'll be perceived by women:) 
Update. When seeing a girl you'd like to approach, don't even try to "feel confident". Instead, think: "See that girl? I am the 
perfect experience for her!". Think of the way she will have goosbumps from the way you'll make her feel good, and if you want 
to, then for just a split-second you can remind yourself of all the ways you could make her cum:) Don't dwell on that though:) 
Just go and offer her the experience of a life-time:)

How to Lay Girls Guide
Update 
Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): "Think about how a woman catches your attention with the aroma of a seductive 
perfume. Imagine how it grabs a woman's attention if a man is wearing a cologne? Now women are more alert to smell than men 
because they have spent many years pampering their bodies with differing lines of cosmetics. So any effort by you on this frontier 
will not go unnoticed. All you have to do is follow these two guidelines. 
NOTE 1: Once you decide to wear after shave your attractiveness rises incredibly. Women pick up the slightest scent of after 
shave and it grabs their attention. Whenever I wear after shave I will invariably get compliments, whether it be in a bar or a petrol 
station. Women often even know the name of your after shave, and they love to tell you what it is. This brings us to the next point 
NOTE 2: I suggest to buy an after shave that is well known so it increases the possibility of women recognising it. This single 
attention to detail can start many relationships for you. If a woman was wanting to talk with you it provides a topic that they feel 
totally at home with, cosmetics. It can even start a conversation from a woman that had no previous interest in you. Most men do 
not regularly wear after shave, so it separates you from the crowd of hungry competitors out there."

Good traits to have/develop to be a successful player
Back to the Table of Contents
According to some PUAs, women obviously want a man with these most important traits: 
H     confidence 
H     humour 
H     smile 
H     well groomed / good looks 
H     ability to create an emotional connection / a feeling of romance 
In addition to that, being a successful player includes: 
H     being patient 
H     being persistent 
H     being comfortable just going up and talking to a new woman 
H     finding opportunities in situations where you before did not believe there would be 
H     being sensitive to how she feels/responds and modifying your approach accordingly 
H     knowing how to talk to a woman to build more rapport with her 
H     knowing how to talk to a woman to make her start thinking in romantic directions 
Having mastered all of the above, these will add the final touch: 
H     mirror her physically 
H     notice her trance words, remember and use them 
H     rephrase everything she says and feed it back to her 
H     anchor all good feelings 
H     don't argue with her, be very understanding, deeply understanding - this can help create an immense rapport 
H     use presuppositions to direct her actions 
H     have and keep good eye contact - also helps to create an immense rapport 
H     touch her 
H     and always start with the cutest girl around:) 
ASF: "Remember, chit chatting about clubs and work school is something she can do with anyone, but someone who can lead her 
into a state of arousal or at least romantic interest is hard to come by. You have to set yourself apart from the other guys by 
minimising the small talk and asking questions which can lead her into a romantic state."

Mr Smooth technique
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
This description is fitted for use with a wingman. 
General rules: 
H     Wherever you are, don't wait for more then three seconds to begin. 
H     All the time have a game-show host mentality - act jolly, happy, goofy, "take it easy", be very open about what you are 
doing and very open about each consecutive action you have in mind, for every little success (holding hand, hand around 
her waist, a kiss) show explicit joy and do a high 5 with your wingman. 
H     You might be ignored at first, the girls will try to hint the two of you better leave etc - that's common. But even if your 
getting the slightest response or feedback, even if negative, don't give up before trying at least five minutes (might seem 
like a monstrous amount of time, but its not, because you're HAVING FUN, and it is bound to stick to the girls as well, 
they'll start smiling and laughing eventually and that's what you're aiming for:) 
H     The moment the girls are comfortable with you, you casually take both their hands like no big deal and hold them while 
still talking and joking your mouth away:) 
H     The girls must be having a fun time with the two of you ALL THE TIME! If they're not smiling or laughing, make your act 
even more jolly (or stupid:). An unsmiling girl is not allowed when doing Mr Smooth:) Thus, no serious topics of 
discussion, forget all that "work/school/hobbies" BS. The discussion has to be extremely simple, even to the point of being 
childish, just as long as the smile doesn't disappear from the girls' faces:) 
H     An exception to the rule above is when you are not explicitly interacting with the girls, like talking to some acquaintances 
of your that happened to pass by or even complete strangers. This time the fact that the girls are not having fun means, that 
they're not having fun because YOU are not paying any attention to them for a moment. Temporarily interacting with other 
people lets the girls feel, how dull and boring it actually is when you're not paying any attention to them - which will urge 
them to win back your attention and KEEP it:) 
H     If the girls are leaving or going somewhere else, attach yourselves to them - they'll definitely feel awkward for a few 
moments in the beginning, but once you've gotten your act rolling, they won't want you to leave:) 
The routine:
1.  Introduce your wingman (W) 
2.  Praise and commend your W ("he's my best friend", "we've been best friends for years ", "he's a great guy", "captain of the 
football team" etc) 
3.  "I'm sure we shall all become very good friends once we all get to know each other a little more/better" 
4.  Never argue with the girl, not about anything, ever! Repeat 2. and 3. if necessary. 
5.  Admire and praise the girl as if you're just forwarding, what your W thinks/said - speak in third person to say anything 
that's on your mind ("my friend thinks you have you have fantastic hair" - stroke her hair; "extremely feminine hands - take 
her hand, stroke it; "my friend thinks you are extremely sexy" - stroke her… um… well, use your better judgement:). 
Speaking in third person disarms her from any objections she might have to what is being said - she can't be mad at you

because you're just forwarding what "your friend said to you earlier and is thinking now", but neither can she attack your 
friend, for he isn't really saying anything:) 
6.  Every time you commend your W to the girl or the girl in third person - touch her arm, put your arm on her shoulder or 
around her waist and pull her (gently:) closer to your W. 
7.  "He really likes you", take the hands of the girl and your W and join them. Do the same with "your" girl, she's probably 
just standing there laughing hysterically or with her eyes wide open and jaw dropped on the floor unable to believe what's 
happening right in front of her eyes, she won't have any capacity left to weigh whether she objects to your taking her hand 
or not:) Now that you and your wingman are both holding hands of your respective girls, its time for a high 5:) 
8.  Repeat 2., 3. and 5. 
9.  Take your W's and his girl's head and try to push them gently together. Alternatively: "He's OK / a pretty good looking 
guy, isn't he? (the girl agrees) Very good, let's play rock-paper-scissors:) The looser has to kiss the winner:)" The trick is, it 
doesn't matter in the least who wins or looses if a kiss has to take place in any case:) 
10.  If the girl refuses to kiss. "He really likes you", point at your cheek - you just meant a kiss on the cheek:) Now it doesn't 
matter, who kisses whom on the cheek (its better if the girl initiates though:). 
11.  Do the same with your girl. Alternatively - your W says: "Now that we've kissed, we want you do the same:)". Time for a 
high 5 after this:) 
12.  Praise what just took place: "That felt / was really good / pleasant / fantastic, didn't / wasn't it?:)", "Its really good, that we 
get along with each other so well / that we are such good friends:)". 
13.  "But it would be truly fantastic to kiss for real, now wouldn't it?:)" (figures:) 
14.  Move closer to your girl, put hand around her waist. 
15.  Repeat the gentle pushing together of heads - now with the overt purpose of a real kiss, repeat with your girl, high 5, praise 
what just took place:) 
16.  To your W's girl "You've really made a fantastic choice with this guy, because he is (bla-bla, lots of positive stuff again)" 
17.  "It really feels good to be with you, we are so glad that we happened to meet you and get to know to you. It would be really 
great, if we could talk to you again and get to know you even better". Time to collect their phone-numbers. Kiss-goodbye, 
this time make it really good, long and intimate. "We have to move on:)". Wait no more than 3 seconds (ok, maybe 10 
seconds max) to engage another pair, don't worry even if the previous girls are still around and could see you. Don't 
however forget to capitalise on the girls that turn out to be fairly "ready", as in "ready for it anything":) Suggest a change 
of venue: "Hey, W, is that offer of yours to drink that fine wine / champagne of yours still standing?". W: "Sure!". You: 
"Hey girls, wanna come along, he lives just around the corner and has an excellent stock of wine / champagne / cigars:)" 
Update. Mr Shack technique - a simpler technique of implementing Mr Smooth, foregoing the gameshow host style and your 
friend standing there like a dork who seemingly can't speak or act for himself;) and stressing the "wow my friend is really a great 
guy!" aspect. By Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): 
"You should get together with a couple of mates and set out a schedule. It will state that each of you are responsible for getting a 
certain amount of dates for the guys in the programme each month. Let's say it is only 2 dates per month you need to organise. 
You will all now have a busy date schedule on top of what you are already doing and this will start an exciting time in your life. 
This can also give you the skills you need to get your own dating happening. The practise you will be getting will be invaluable 
because you are learning what works and what doesn't with approaching women. 
You will need to approach girls you don't know and talk about your friend. If she says no it won't hurt your ego because she is 
saying no about your friend. All you have to say is this: "Hi, my name is Joe and I noticed you about 5 minutes ago. It might seem 
a little strange me coming and introducing myself like this but don't panic". Have a bit of a laugh here and she probably will to. 
It'll break up the intensity and things always flow better when you relax the girl. 
"I'm actually speaking to you because a friend of mine has just broken up with his girlfriend and he's a bit down." Always give the 
impression you [or in this case - your friend] have just broken up with a girl. Women automatically think there must be something 
wrong with you if you haven't got a girlfriend. So always use this line and you will notice a huge difference. 
"I told him he should do something a little crazy and let me organise a blind date for him. Anyway thats why I'm talking with you 
now. He's a great guy and very good looking." It is important to mention that your friend is a great guy and very good looking.

Even if he isn't she will hope it is true. Create a picture in her mind. Remember: fantasy is what is needed to start the fire which 
may burn for a lifetime. Women love fantasy. 
"How about you give me your phone number and I'll tell him to call you and if you like each other you can go out"? Now if she 
says you should give your friends number to her and she will call him you say: "Yeah that sounds okay but I know he has to go 
away with work sometime shortly and it might be better if I gave your number to him. Is that okay?" This is about the best line to 
say here when they pull this line on you. When you say your friend has to go away for work it makes him sound successful and 
chicks love that. When you end it with: "Is that okay?" she will think you are not being too pushy and she will be guided by your 
assumption that your friend and her will at least speak on the phone. You are creating an impression that it's just a matter of who 
will call who. If however they persist with wanting to call your friend instead of him calling her then just give her his number and 
tell her a couple of good things about your friend. Not too much or it will sound desperate but enough to get her juices flowing. 
Note: you must always try and help your friends with dates. Sometimes it reverses and you will end up with the girl. The more 
you land for friends the more chance there is of a friend going out of their way to help you. It's also a grouse buzz to get your mate 
laid. You sort of feel part of it as though you were getting laid yourself and your mate will be very happy."

Miscellaneous suggestions and observations about seduction
Back to the Table of Contents
Misc I 
G     Women love men just as much as we love women. Women love sex just as much as we do. Women are gonna get it 
somewhere, may as well be you. 
G     Women need romance. The way to a woman's panties is through her mind, heart, and soul. 
G     No matter how hard the shell, they all have a soft centre. 
G     Get to know everything you can about women. Study this subject. 
G     You can never build too much rapport. Good rapport is the foundation of the relationship. 
G     Be playful. Be confident. Be in charge. 
G     The more you make her laugh, the closer you are to where you want to be. Take every opportunity to make her laugh. 
G     Never ask her for anything, instead suggestively entice and let her give to you. If there is to be an exception, then simply 
tell her what will be. 
G     When she is being difficult, challenge her. 
G     Never give her anything, instead reward her. If she will not give you anything, give her a reason to, or challenge her to, or 
dare her to. 
G     Maintain a high self esteem at all costs. This may mean cutting your losses at times. 
G     Make yourself more attractive. Work out regularly. Wear better clothes. Watch the guys who get the girls and wear what 
they wear. It's not that fucking hard to do and it goes a long fucking ways. Women have a saying "You are what you wear." 
G     Get to know poetry. It is the perfect medium for you to lubricate her, but in a romantic and metaphorical way. Best thing: 
she thinks you are a poetic, deep, and sensual man; not a pervert, even though you are being a total pervert, hehe:) 
G     And… Always… Eye contact, Eye contact, Eye contact! 
Misc II 
Seduction is largely a matter of not making the same mistakes. Not making mistakes includes: 
G     Not being supplicating 
G     Not moving too fast or pushing her 
G     Not walking past obviously perfect opportunities 
G     Not avoiding a woman just because you might think that she is not the ideal woman 
G     Not giving up on her if a voice in your head tries to tell you there is some reason to drop it 
G     Not giving a shit about rejection. 
Update. More mistakes to avoid. Vincent Runza, ASF: 
G     Timid, unsure behavior in front of girls.

G     Offering to 'get her something' - a drink, food, chair, etc. is called supplication - DON'T DO IT! 
G     A cting like she is more special than you are - she isn't, BTW. 
G     Asking her a question and not listening to the answer. 
G     Counting yourself out with a girl before you've even met. 
G     Assuming she's not the type to take you somewhere right now and fuck your brains out - even the best of us occasionally 
make that mistake. 
Mr Happy, ASF: "This is one of the BASICS: Once you demonstrate to a woman that she can manipulate you, she loses all sexual 
attraction for you and designates you as a pawn." 
Misc III 
To have sex with a girl you must.. 
1.  appear confident and in control. CONTROL / ATTRACTION. 
2.  be entertaining and spontaneous. REWARD. 
3.  be friendly and charming. REWARD. 
4.  not have the appearance of being broke. CONTROL / ATTRACTION. 
5.  wear nice clean clothes and smell ok. ATTRACTION. 
6.  not appear too eager. ATTRACTION. 
CONTROL = Your state when you are not "rewarding" the girl. REWARD = Milk and cookies… ATTRACTION = I have 
something that you're looking for:) 
Details of the above six characteristics: 
1.  Appearance of confidence and control comes from body language, facial expression and mannerisms... Try to make as 
many decisions as possible on your own, have the look like whatever progress that's happening with the girl is just the way 
you expected it to go, even appear to check out other girls occasionally... Do not look unusually happy just because the girl 
said something nice. Occasionally NEG HIT, if you see the intensity dropping off somewhat… NEG HIT as punishment 
and do so jokingly. 
2.  Spontaneity / Entertainment can be demonstrated with a good sense of humour and quick thinking... If you can make 
humorous responses even to the dull comments that girls make and then anchor all the favourable responses you are doing 
well. Whenever a girl seems to be laughing sincerely and not for the sake of politeness make sure to anchor that 
somehow… So as to keep the best times memorable... Do not do this constantly though. Do this in response to positive 
feed back from her conversation/body language/posture. Do not give away too much of this. This is like a reward. 
3.  To be friendly and charming show the girl glimpses of you being a "gentleman" do so only when she seems to have 
done/said something nice to you. She will be able to see that those kind of behaviours that you like to see from her lead her 
to your soft inner self. Girls like to change bad boys into nice guys. They like to think that they can change your behaviour. 
Its an ego trip for them and this is also a reward. This is a stronger one than 2. 
4.  e.g. Open the door for the girl for example if she rubbed your crotch in the night club... 
5.  Don't wear cheap trash. Do not hang with people that do. 
6.  As above. 
7.  To not appear too eager, you must not go physical prematurely and must not go to sexual audio prematurely. A girl will 
often mention sex directly and/or indirectly with speech and/or physical contact. Safest bet is to initiate the sexual part of 
the PU after such an indication and not before... Stick to the control/reward phase until such indication. Exceptions apply 
of course but rarely... Almost always you will be aware of the girls readiness to move into sexual directions. For the 
exceptions just start KINO with the neutral bodyzones moving into more sexual and your movement should proceed with 
regard to the girls feedback.

ASF: "And do not spend more than 10 minutes with any one girl if you have not been given any signal to get EL PHYSICAL:)" 
Update 
Sales techniques applied to seduction. And vice versa. Jake Thomson, ASF: 
"At one point in my life I worked in sales, and yes, I used the principles discussed in speed seduction to make sales. It works quite 
nicely as it's simply basic persuasion. This is the process for making ecological sales and/or seductions. 
0. Get rapport. 
1. Qualify your prospect. Are they good enough for your product? IOW, do they have the means and the ability to pay for it? Are 
they the decision maker? If yes, proceed. Else, eject and find another prospect. 
2. Further qualify your prospect. Take the time to find out what their most desired emotional states are. Is your product good for 
them? Will it help to fill their wants/needs as the prospect perceives them? Also, you may want to learn what their least desired 
states are. IOW, what emotions will they do almost anything to avoid experiencing? Will your product/service help them avoid 
those least desired states? If yes to either of these conditions, proceed. Else, eject and find another prospect. 
3. Learn your prospect's convince themselves to buy strategy. 
4. Capture and lead your prospect's imagination. 
5. Help them access those highly valued emotions they have and link those emotional states to owning/having your 
product/service. And/or help them link their least desired states to NOT owning/having your product/service. Do this in a way that 
fits the prospects convince themselves to buy strategy. 
6. Accelerate/increase your prospect's emotional states until they compel action to buy. 
7. Do a take away and make them prove that they can and will avoid buyers remorse. 
8. Let them buy your product/service, deliver the goods, and collect your paycheck. 
Keep in mind that in sales or seduction you want to strive for a win/win situation, i.e.. value given for value received for BOTH 
sides." 
Update 
Mystey's rules, ASF: 
RULE: Enthusiasm is contagious. Act enthused about something that happened to you and so will she. 
RULE: Convey your day has been INCREDIBLE and then proceed to explain WHY. Like meeting her is completely secondary. 
NOTHING can wreck this day! 
RULE: Connect with her using "I live my life one day at a time" attitudes. 
RULE: Connect with her using "So many people are so judgemental about things. You seem really open and fun". 
Update 
Jargon's rules, ASF: 
The attitude: 
G     - Your time is valuable. Don't waste your time. Use it effectively.

G     - Women want and enjoy sex 
G     - Go play. Get girls into bed. That is *IT*. That's the goal. 
G     - Everything is an opportunity. 
G     - There is no failure. You either learn or you succeed. 
Meeting 
G     - It's up to you to approach. Don't wait longer that 3 seconds. 
G     - Approach often. 
G     - Learn how to hold a conversation. Engage your listeners. Listen well when others speak. 
G     - Avoid typical pick-up spots. Women are on guard. 
G     - Be conversational and friendly in your "approach." You don't want her to put up her defenses. 
G     - Any place is a good place. 
G     - Get her away from others, even if briefly 
G     - Don't be afraid to say "adios" at any point. 
General Conversation 
G     - Learn the art of conversation 
G     - Complement her choices and skills, not her. (Clothes, hair style, projects, etc.) 
G     - Speak of your hopes and ambitions. Show that you are going somewhere in your life. 
G     - Invoke memories in her that bring up positive, in-love, open emotions. 
G     - Catch her imagination 
G     - Use kino, communication by touch. 
G     - Listen to her. Ask her question. 
G     - Echo her values. 
Closing 
G     - Don't linger too long. AFC's linger. Your time is valuable. 
G     - Challenge her for her number, don't ask. Lead. Do not supplication. It will be her idea to give you her number if you do 
everything right. 
G     - Listen to her. She will give you opportunities. It's up to you to spot and identify those opportunities. That's not always 
easy. 
Update
Ned Ragdnuos, ASF: "You "gain points" by changing her state of mind, making her feel curious, happy, mersmerized by you, 
feeling that you understand her better than anyone else in the world, feeling that she's known you forever, feeling like she can 
remember already having gone out with you and had a great time, and looking back on this moment in time as having been the 
start of it all. It's just language, you can be as playful as you want. 
If she tells you that she thinks you are trying to pick her up, you make no apologies, and agree with her, saying that you do want 
to fuck her... but you'd rather prefer to get to know her first. 
Update
DrLove, Mindlist: "For most women, they have experienced pain in a relationship before and they often want some sort of re-
assurance that they won't have to re-experience this. This is a little difficult and every situation requires a different approach. Here 
are a few guiding principles that come to mind: 
1) Have in your own mind the belief that what you have to offer her is truely beneficial to both of you. You mustn't have any

hidden reservations or doubts about the benevolence of your intentions. 
2) BE HONEST! I know this runs contrary to what some "successful" seducers may tell you but long term it does result in the best 
out come for all concerned. Even if you are seeing other women, she'll appreciate you more if you're open and upfront about it. 
Honesty will show in your congruency (see also Managing many relationships at once). 
3) Be original and creative. Never let her know what to expect from you. This will set you apart from all the jerks and AFCs she's 
met before. It will also keep her on her toes. One of our mindlist sisters gave the brilliant metaphor of peeling away layers of an 
onion (in discovering what a man is like) - use her advice! (see also Have and reveal secrets). 
4) Be willing to show your true emotions. When you feel angry, say so! This will re-inforce her trust in you. 
5) Do whatever you can to make her feel good. I know this sounds obvious, but the manner in which you do it is important: don't 
supplicate and don't try to buy your way into her pants, surprise her with your words, with poetry, with visualisation exercises. 
6) Make sure her neuro-associations with you are positive. This means DO NOT ACT AS HER COUNSELLOR, THERAPIST 
OR BUDDY! Remember the rule: When you discuss a woman's problem with her, you become her problem. 
Update
Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): "What are your greatest attributes? You need to make them ****SHINE**** like 
diamonds. Your weakpoints will need to be brought to a reasonable standard so they won't be an achilles' heel. If you own a great 
car don't be afraid to show it. Just don't make it obvious. If your car is a bomb then make sure you don't present it as one. If you 
have great legs then show them. If you don't there is no need to be wearing shorts in the middle of winter even if the sun is out. Do 
the best with what you have!"

Managing many relationships at once
Back to the Table of Contents
Chasing other girls while being in a relationship with one girl is percieved as a cruel and insensitive thing to do. And it is - 
assuming a one-on-one relationship is the norm. 
If you have established a one-on-one relationship with one girl and she sees/discovers/hears you chase other girls, it is quite 
natural for her to assume, that you are doing that to have ensuing one-on-one relationships with those other girls, thus abandoning 
her and leaving her all alone. She will feel miserable, deceived, unhappy etc and you are the cause of all that. 
So have you been cruel and insensitive? Yes. For having chased other girls? No. You have been cruel and insensitive for having 
established a one-on-one relationship and thus giving her grounds to assume that your chasing other girls will mean the end of 
your relationship with her. Of course, you can do all the explaining you want with her now, but the fact is - you have been leading 
her in a false direction. 
In order to avoid any such unpleasant consequences, frame your relationship with her the way _you_ would like to see it from the 
start. If you want to be with her but not with her exclusively, let her know. If she walks then most probably she wouldn't have 
fitted into your future anyway. If she stays, it has been _her_ decision to accept your terms and now you won't have to worry 
about keeping your possible "adventures" a secret from her or how hurt she might feel if they came to her knowledge, she won't 
have to feel paranoid, jealeous or miserable because she knows, that as the two of you are not in a strict, traditional and 
monogamous one-on-one relationship, a new relationship of yours will not endanger her position the way it usually would, plus, 
should she feel like it, she is free to pursue any interests of hers without feelings of guilt or shame as well:) (Don't tell her that last 
thing though - she might take a "you are free to meet other people as well" the wrong way, it just too well a known substitute for 
"I'm dumping you", which is _not_ what you mean). 
As for the right time to frame the relationship (if a relationship is something you want with her in the first place) - there is no right 
time. It is however probably best to frame it only after she has had the chance to taste _all_ the goodies that come with being with 
you (so that she'll know exactly what she'll be missing out on while her "sisters" are getting it, should she decide to walk:) but 
before she has come to expect a traditional relationship with you and especially before her she will start feeling her expectations 
of a traditional relationship with you being threatened by your more than friendly interactions with various other females (so that 
she will not be hurt and can be the judge of her actions now that she has an understanding of the situation). 
So if you want relationships but don't want to be confined to them - be discreetly honest, tell her you want her but that you are 
already engaged in a couple of relationships of a more physical nature, and as those girls also know that neither of them is your 
only one, so should she, and now that she knows the situation, the decision as to a further course of action (either staying and 
accepting, or leaving) is up to her to make. 
Update 
A practical suggestion by Alphahot1, ASF: "If you're going to be some kinda player, know that the average guy can handle 
roughly about 3 women at any time. That is, not all at once (although that happens too sometimes) but over time, assuming of 
course that you are COMPLETELY accommodating all 3 (or however many) women. 
I have found that a practice that works very well, going with the above figures, is to keep from 5 to 6 women on the string at all 
times. 3 in "active" mode and at least 2 or 3 in the wings. I have found this to be a very good practice for being assured of being 
laid almost every night, if you so desire. If any of your 5 or 6 women start to get out of line and start giving you trouble, DUMP

her immediately and replace her, always keeping the numbers right about the same. 
The key of course here is OPTIONS. Generally, the more options you have, the better off you will always be. Just don't get TOO 
many - that can sometimes be just as bad or even worse than not having any options at all. So if you have any kind of life 
whatsoever other than just women, I think you will find TOTALLY accommodating about 3 of them to be just about a full time 
job." 
Update
How to frame the whole situation, when the question of dating many women concurrently does come up with one of the girls. 
Marcus, Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: "It doesn't matter how many people we can share our affections with, but rather it's 
about how well we can truly be with whom we're with when we're with them."

If you've ever wondered, how to reconcile the seeming discrepancy between the two most common things you've heard about 
women, namely: 
G     women like mystery in a man 
G     women like to know secrets about a man 
then here's an explanation by Kate Reynolds from Mindlist: 
"A short time ago there was a thread about revealing secrets as a way to gain rapport. IMHO this really is a great way to establish 
rapport, but it can be carried too far. I (and perhaps other women) like the idea of layers. Like peeling an onion, we like to think 
there is always more that we don't know yet. So, sharing a secret is fine as long as you convey the idea that there are lots more - 
and that you are willing to give some up for a price. I grow bored when I think I know all there is to know about someone."

Be the Alpha/Dominant male
Back to the Table of Contents
NightLight9, ASF: 
"The Alpha male - I use this phrase a lot... Here is quick run down of what it means to me. If you watch animal shows on PBS or 
Discovery Channel, many species have a dominant male who has sex with all the females in the group, while the other males get 
none while waiting for him to die or until they are tough enough to kick his ass and become the alpha male themselves. Many 
males never get to be an alpha male (never get laid). 
Often it seems like you know guys who are always getting laid and other guys never get laid. You'll even see women talking 
to/hanging out/being friends with the average guy, but then sleep with some other guy (even if he is a jerk, sleeps around and 
doesn't respect them). The guy who gets laid is playing the role of the alpha male, while the other guys are submissive males. 
I'm saying be the guy who gets laid. That guy is confident that he's going to get laid, because he knows he's an alpha male. He 
knows that women and people in general want to be with him so he doesn't shy away from conversation and meeting new people. 
He doesn't worry what others think about him when he's doing his thing. He takes control of a situation with authority. He knows 
he's fun to be with because he is always having a good time and therefore he _is_ fun to be with. He knows that if he is in a 
group of guys and a group of girls, he will be the one the girls choose to be with, and by having this to be the expected outcome, 
it is a self fufilling profecy. 
Ok here's, how I did the Alpha/Dominant Male thing.... First I created a model of what I thought a Dominant Male should be. 
Much the same as the one stated before. Then I used it to change my frame of reference about myself, ie I stepped into my model 
of the Dominant Male. I claimed what I knew to be my genetic right. nd I didn't care who knew it. I didn't make excuses for it 
either. I just excepted it as the natural order of things. This is not an outward thing that you do but rather an inward change that 
radiates outward in everything you do. 
Being the alpha male is all about attitude and projecting the image that you are fun to be with and the woman should want to be 
with you. Being the alpha male is self perpetuating. The more you believe you are the alpha male, the more you become the 
alpha male. 
As for competing with the muscle boys - that's why I changed my model from seeing myself as the Alpha Male (there can only 
be one) to a Dominant Male (there can be more than one, but they're all dominant)." 
Update. While the above discussed being the dominant male amongst other males, the following will explain how to extend a 
similar attitude to your dealings with the opposite sex. Jason, Clifford's Seduciton newsletter: 
"There's an attitude to take with super HB's (and all women really) that is pure gold. The thought is that "INSTINCTUALLY 
women KNOW their role." The key word here is INSTINCTUALLY. What this means is that on an "instinctual" level women 
ARE all the same! They get their juices flowing when they are in the presence of a MAN who is living HIS ROLE. MAN is the 
dominant one, NOT woman. And deep down inside women KNOW this. This has NOTHING to do with being an asshole. This 
is about being a MAN who is NOT afraid [which doesn't necessarily only have to mean the usual "TARZAN NOT AFRAID!!" 
macho stuff, but also not being afraid to be honest, sensitive and caring when the time is right].

How to Lay Girls Guide
You have to be the MAN who has all the sexual power. And when a woman (no matter how hot) sees and feels the presence of a 
man whom she recognizes as the dominant one while SHE isn't, she does what every woman does - that is SURRENDERS to the 
more powerful being. And all that acting like she's hot and knows she's the stuff and all those other "head up in the air" tricks are 
just a test and a way to weed out all the men who are less powerful than her and don't know their role as a MAN."

Do my looks matter?
Back to the Table of Contents
Yes, but not nearly as much as you think they do. Men judge women primarily by their looks - face, hair, eyes… ok-ok, I should 
have started with tits and ass, I know:) Anyway, more than anything else it is looks that turns us on… and also what turns us off. 
So its only natural that we think the same works for women. Women however attribute much less importance to how a man looks 
as opposed to how the man can make her feel - patterns, value-eliciting, Mr Smooth etc strategies are direct derivatives of that 
realisation. Good looks - the right face, body, clothes - will get you an audition with a woman much more easily. But ONLY an 
audition. From that point on it all still boils down to how you can make her feel. So yes, you'll get more auditions the better you 
look, but its your ability to make the girls feel sparkles, tingles and magic deep down inside that makes them want you, not your 
looks:) See also the "Iranian from Hell" story by Maniac High.

The Iranian from Hell
Back to the Table of Contents
by Maniac High 
Last year, I was in a Tokyo bar with one of my GFs. And, we spotted on the dance floor, the Iranian from hell. He looked like 
shit, was fat, ugly as sin, wore clothes that looked like it came from the salvation army, and a worn out baseball cap. Oh, and did 
I say he was 45 Y.O. about, and probably didn't speak ENglish, or Japanese..., and probably had a shit job taking chicken guts 
out of bird in a processing plant...or was an illegal who lived in a park or something. This guy was by far the most discusting 
basket case loser in the place that whole night. As well, in this thoroughly racist country, Iranians are at the very bottom of the 
barrel, below gaijins, Japanese, Asians..everything..that is as low as you go... (Japanese perspectives..not mine).. 
So what did he do? He went on the dance floor, and hit on *EVERY* chick there. Most (no all actually!), blew him out instantly! 
but he didn't give up. He was persistant like fuck, I never saw a guy as persistant as him, he'd get knocked out and was right back 
in there., and as long as he got any reaction (good or bad), he kept on hitting.. And he had no wing either, this was a totally solo 
act.. 
ANd guess what! He started to get kino on a chick, who totally in his face blew him out a little earlier (he since hit on other 
chicks), and at first she resisted, and gave really bad looks, but he kept plugging away, and then she relented (she didn't leave), 
and started to dance with him, coldly at first, obviously not enjoying it. LAter they got closer, and her face relaxed, as he smiled 
at her and tried to charm her,, (he tried often,and she pushed back), ...and 20 minutes later, they were kissing and all over each 
other! Later they left together.. her hanging all over him... And the chick was an HB too, 20s, and very cute! So whenever I think 
I am not good looking enough (I am average), or see some model type hit on chicks that I want, and feel jealous or something I 
always remember the "Iranian from hell" story... and remember Its not what you look like...its what you do...Always... 
fortunately, for guys, looks has very little to do with the endgame, if your ugly, just get in there, and show personality. that will 
work the same as looking like Brad Pitt...So dont worry if you're ugly, it just doesn't matter...

Nice guys vs jerks
Back to the Table of Contents
The debate of nice guys vs jerks is one of the oldest of relationships and seduction issues. The essence of being a "nice guy" 
however is widely misunderstood. It is believed, that being polite, considerate, friendly, tender, romantic etc is what being a "nice 
guy" is all about and thus should be avoided, as it is the "jerk", the rude, the inconsiderate, he impolite, the rough guy who always 
gets to shag the girl while the "nice guy" is waiting outside in the pouring rain with flowers in his hand... and waiting... and 
waiting...:) 
It doesn't however mean, that women prefer rude over polite, inconsiderate over considerate etc. It all becomes clear when we 
look at a very important issue often overlooked when trying to define, what makes the "jerks" beat the "nice guys" when it comes 
to getting the girls. It is sexuality - the "jerks" are not afraid to show that they are sexual beings, while for the "nice guys" hiding 
their sexuality is part of their agenda of being friendly, polite and and courtious towards women. Big mistake:) 
Peta, Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: "It dawned on me as it has, that the androgyny is key. Women fall for bastards because they 
don't turn off the sexuality.. "nice" guys think women will be terrified of their sexuality, so they turn it off and all they get is 
women responding to their androgyny [sending all nice guys to LJBF-land]"

Talking about sex
Back to the Table of Contents
A few words of advice - don't ever start a conversation with a girl with sex, sexual innuendoes etc (there's an exception to this 
though, see the GM technique which expressly oozes and drips of sexual innuendoes with the false pretence of being humorous 
and "just kidding":). Don't misunderstand it though, the emphasis is on the word "start". 
Its just like with patterns - if you start a conversation with a pattern, you´ll just sound embarrassingly lame. And if you start the 
conversation with sexual innoendos, you might never get a chance to continue the conversation. Unless you use the GM technique 
to harvest for girls directly, blatantly and shamelessly interested in sex (see also "The cold approach"), you'd better not take any 
aspects of the GM technique out of context to use as openers. Unless of course you are playing the Crash and Burn game:) 
Steamy topics of discussion are fine, once you've established rapport with a girl, the conversation has been going smooth, her 
body-language shows interest etc, she's past being comfortable with you, is already into intrigue and maybe even starting to feel a 
little horny:) Introduce sex, watch her reactions, be sensitive yet bold. Use quotes ("my friend Katie once told me about how he 
had a quick-fuck from a boy he hardly knew":), you can safely get quite graphic using quotes and she can safely get horny 
because you're not talking about yourself or her:) But once again, try not to start the conversation with sexual innuendoes, it can 
be a major turn-off for a girl. 
Mystery suggests to avoid sex-talk completely (she deals primarily with the 9-s and 10-s though:). Mystery: "Bringing up sex 
shows its on your mind and if you were truly a guy who gets girls you wouldn't think about it then. No sex comments. No sex 
jokes. Go KINO but don't talk sex." 
Update
Clifford, Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: "One thing I have noticed is that a lot of women will kind of recoil when you say 
something a bit too sexual and then, if you pursue it with no apologies, they spring back very positively about the comment. It 
doesn't happen all the time, and certainly depends on the comment itself, but many women do respond to sexual comments after 
an initial, what shall we call it, politically correct reaction."

Use sexual stories to get her horny
Back to the Table of Contents
Use personal experience or fantasy stories to get her horny. ASF: "Never use stories DIRECTLY INVOLVING the girl you're 
with. QUOTE about what you did to other chicks or what you want to do to other chicks or ask her about what she has done or 
would like to do with other guys. You can use this even in every-day discussions by elaborating at the right time and in the right 
direction:) A variation: get her in a private place, and feed her with fantasies, increasingly sexual, in a hypnotic way, until she 
can't stand it anymore and will rape you:)" A journalist discussing SS, Playboy, July'98: "I had a friend in college whose success 
with women was mind-boggling, given his Napoleonic stature and receding hairline. I remember my college friend playfully 
turning every conversation with a girl, no matter where she would try to steer it, into something with sexual undertones. He'd get 
her thinking about sex, and pretty soon she was thinking about having sex with him." Remember that steering the conversation 
into something with sexual undertones doesn't even necessarily have to mean talking explicitly about sex, see "The Discovery 
Channel pattern" for an example of this. Talking about something innocent but inserting the words "penetrate", "come inside", 
"hard", "surrender" into the conversation might do the trick just as well. Whether to use covert (SS and patterns) or overt (GM 
style) conversation is not always easy to decide, the best advice I can give concerning this is just to experiment and "develop an 
intuition":) 
An example of a combination of a cold approach, quoting, stacking realities and using fantasy stories. ASF: ""I know this guy 
named Vincent, he was telling me about a woman friend of his. She said that she was standing by herself in a bar one time when 
this guy walks up to her, looks her dead in the eyes and said, "I would like to fuck you. Would you like to fuck me?" and then just 
stands there. She said she nearly dropped her drink, but then she started thinking about it and began feeling that heat building up 
in her body. You know how you feel when you start to get really aroused? All wet and excited? She didn't miss a beat and started 
playing right back at him. She said, "I'd want you to go down on me first..." 
Anyway use your exquisite language skills to tell her exactly what you'd like to do to her & have Vincent's friend tell it to her. I 
mean it's not like *YOU'RE* telling her you want to eat her out & fuck her brains loose or anything:)" 
An example of a line to use in a conversation. "When was the last time you had an orgasm? I really think you need to find a guy 
right now... and let him bend you over the bathroom sink and let him have his way with you." 
Update. (Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...":) "Most women love the romantic and emotional stuff, while others are not 
necessarily interested in a relationship of any kind but would really enjoy a good session of hot and wild session of unforgettable 
sex, no strings attached. 
So how do you begin to talk about that kind of low down and dirty sex? Well, if you see that she doesn't respond to relationship 
type conversation, move away from it. Offer a different perspective. You can either describe other couples that you know that are 
not communicating like they should and how much of a hassle it can be to be in a loveless relationship and so on. 
So what's the alternative? It doesn't have to be your own opinion but you can mention how much of a hassle free a purely sexual 
experience can be between two horny people. They can share all their fantasies without fear of being judged by a loved one and 
threatened with a break-up, they are free to experience many things that might be viewed as taboo by people in a serious 
relationship etc. You can talk about how easy it is to arrange something and see it through when it comes to nothing but physical 
pleasure. You can say how both men and women can experiment with their sexual urges and curiousities without any relationship 
insecurities or jealousy. You can give examples of other couples that you know where the woman always fantasized about being

How to Lay Girls Guide
with another woman but the husband was scared that she might leave him for a lesbian. In a purely physical relationship, it's all 
about what makes us feel good, it's all about exploring fantasies and feeling comfortable with who we are as we are. 
If you've hit the target, she will agree with you and feel a connection between the two of you because she will feel you are both 
the same. At that point you can ask her about her favorite position or her favourite fantasies that she was never able to talk about 
or act on in a closed and conventional relationship. You can tell her about some mild fantasies of yours and direct the 
conversation to how wonderful it feels to be able to express yourselves in this way. You can even mention how talking about this 
kind of stuff is making you hot right there and then probe to see if she feels the same way. You can joke about the two of you 
trying to seduce another person together for a possible threesome and more depending on the fantasies she already told you about. 
If everything clicks you will know because if you don't go for the close, she will."

The Ideal Guy routine
Back to the Table of Contents
NYC, ASF: "If I can't get her to be interested in me, I go into the "the ideal guy" routine. Since she thinks I'm helping her to find 
what she wants, she greedily, hungrily describes her dream guy. Then I get her to describe what he's wearing, how his hair looks, 
how his voice is, what he says to her, how his chest feels, how she feels in his arms... I just ask her the right questions to get her 
meta-stating ABOUT someone that makes her feel the way she likes to feel in order to fuck. She thinks about and experiences 
the feelings, but WHO is she talking to? ME. Basically she gets confused and thinks she is feeling that way about me when she is 
actually feeling that way about some other guy. If she likes HIM, but is talking to YOU, it probably means she doesn't have the 
GUTS to approach him fearing a rejection. You can get her to think about him all night if you want, and he'll remain a living 
fantasy to her. Meanwhile... she is getting horny in general AND you are the one making her feel the way she does. Just by being 
with you and seeing you and hearing you and touching you, she gets these feelings... basically she transfers what she WANTS 
from the guy over to you. 
The other benefit of this style is that girls will admit their horny behaviour when you are NOT talking about yourself and you 
ARE talking about some movie star or something... for instance: 
Me: what would you do if Keanu walked in here right now?
Her: I would seduce him any way I can
Me: what would you do to seduce Keanu? 
Next, she spills the beans about what she would do to convince a man she REALLY WANTS to be with her. Getting all hot and 
bothered along the way of course:) And since you're in the vicinity…:)"

GM style explained
Back to the Table of Contents
Contributed to ASF by Nathan Szilard, this is the description of the technique used by a PUA acquaintance of his nick-named 
Grand Master Flash's. Hence the name GM technique. The key here is smutty sex jokes and continuous humorous sex-talk with 
keen attention to how the girl reacts, so as to forestall any negative reactions (and you can be sure, there will be plenty in the 
beginning!:) by saying "just kidding", giving an "apologetic" hug to the girl etc. The reasoning here is this, that if the girl has no 
chance to express her negative comments about sex-jokes and -comments, this translates in her subconsciousness to agreeing and 
accepting what is being said. The defences will eventually go down, she has to imagine all the sex-jokes in her mind in order to 
understand them, and although she might be disgusted or repelled about them in the first place, she won't be able to express her 
negativism, her mind is bombarded with more sexual references, she just keeps imagining and before she knows it, nature kicks in 
and… she's getting horny:) Simple:) But potentially dangerous as hell - you really need to be in your element with all the sex 
jokes and keep "just kidding" in time not to get slapped in the beginning etc. otherwise you could fail miserably:) 
Nathan Szilard on GM Flash and his technique, ASF: "That's his aggressive style. Basically he told them he wanted to fuck from 
the beginning. He had the attitude that he could satisfy them sexually. He had the confidence that says he does this all the time. He 
was in their face. He was making them excited. He was stimulating them like they are not USED TO being stimulated. If they 
were going to resist, they would have resisted when he first told them what he wanted from them. There is the INCORRECT 
assumption that chicks don't like DICK! They love it and they want it! The problem is they want it from the guys they want it 
from. All he has to do is offer them the SECOND best thing... sexual satisfaction as opposed to sex with a man they WANT! He 
doesn't even have to satisfy them:) It's too late by the time he's fucking them! All he has to do is make them BELIEVE that if they 
get with him he is going to fuck them WELL! They couldn't resist because at some point they became HORNY and wanted that 
RELEASE!"

forced to confess, that they actually do like you. Tricky eh?:) 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/gmlines.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:31:34 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
Nathan Szilard, ASF: "OKAY ONE IMPORTANT THING: you'd think that he gets blown off every time he says something that 
stupid, right? YES HE SHOULD!! He would IF he didn't say "JUST KIDDING " *before* she has a chance to reply. 
Psychologically speaking, since she does not have the time to reply negatively, she's somewhat agreeing. It's rather obvious when 
you see it happening. If she starts replying negatively, he cuts her down by saying, "yeah I like to say stupid things, life's too short 
not to have fun" or "I like to act like a little kid - I am a kid"." And then he continues with what he started with:) One other thing 
he uses to go kino fast and often is insulting the girl and then "apologising" right away by kissing and hugging:) 
A possible explanation of why the GM style actually works, Nathan Szilard: "You don't get rejected as you would expect - when 
you think about it, to reject something, you have to know what it is. When you've heard one particular line a thousand times, you 
know what it means, what it is, what it aims at ... When GM approaches she's here, wondering what the fuck is going on ... it's so 
outrageous, she can't react in a predetermined way." 
From someone who tried the GM technique just to test it, ASF: "It was at the point I was feeling a little guilty because one was a 
real sweetheart and I just wanted to fall back to being nice and letting her talk about her boyfriend - but when I did - I could 
instantly see it was a mistake so I'd come off with "I gotta get an operation tomorrow..." and she'd come back with a "You're so 
bad" and hitting me... It was easy and she made sure to give me her phone number! I didn't even ask! This experiment tells me to 
memorise every one of these lines. They are killer! Pure gold! These are powerful jokes. Funny how the one who gave me her 
phone number kept saying she loved a sense of humour. I thought the jokes weren't funny at all. I was just mouthing words and 
she was laughing. I couldn't believe it. The other one had to go but she fell right into talking about sex. WOW!'" 
Update
Nathan Szilard, ASF: "An idea to go beyond GM style: describing the woman as a slut. Isntead of telling her "you are beautiful" 
as an AFC does, describe her as if she was doing something overtly and consciously sexual. 
See where I'm going to? 
What I learnt from GM, well and from textbook psychology - you can get people to form an opinion about themselves. Let that 
opinion be that she is a slut." 
The word "slut" in this context is a highly sexual and constantly horny female (not a prostitute). 
Update. Doing a pick-up on the street GM-style (suggested by Nathan Szilard, ASF). You have eye-contact with a woman on the 
street, she passes, and when you turn back, make sure she hears this: "Hey! ... What does this mean? You ogle at me and you don't 
even stop to talk to me? I'm not a sex object!". She'll probably be standing there, looking back at you and feeling stunned, now go 
approach, introduce yourself, act all "hurt" for being taken as only a sex object, offer her to chance to make it up to you by having 
the two of you getting to know each other over a cup of coffee etc:)

NEED. They get guys who come too soon, fawn over and smother her. Basically they (the 9-10s) don't get regularly or don't ever

Women want good sex and romance
Back to the Table of Contents
Don Diebel: "Women don't want just sex - they want good sex and romance. Women's desires are much greater than most men 
realise. But, unlike men, who are mostly just after sex, women are looking for great sexual experiences. Women are very 
discriminating and choosy in picking sexual partners. They are only interested in having a sexual encounter with a partner that 
sexually arouses them and/or promises, by his manner or image or personality, to be "good in bed." Women want exciting, 
provocative, imaginative partners who will lead them through great sexual experiences. Though their sexual desire may be very 
high, they will pass up just any sexual encounter waiting to find the one that promises to be special. But women know that good 
sex is hard to find - once they have it, they will not let go easily:)" 
So make sure that when you do her, you do her right:)

Should you express or contain your sexual desires?
Back to the Table of Contents
The whole point of seduction is to make the girl want you… really bad:) So the point of expressing or containing your own 
desires is moot. If you know how to make her want you (specific strategies are discussed within this guide), you might actually be 
more likely faced with the situation of trying to contain her sexual desires instead of yours:). 
If however you are a clueless and horny AFC, the following piece of advice is for you (DD): 
"Don't rush things sexually with single women. Appear as if you are still deciding whether or not you want to be involved. The 
first example in this section of ending a date before she does, is a great way to accomplish this. Also, if the mood, the time, the 
place isn't right, or it feels the slightest bit awkward, don't try kissing her for the first time. If she's interested, the time and place 
will come. But, by pushing it, you risk blowing an important event, you risk coming off as being desperate for action and worst of 
all, you risk appearing inexperienced and inept. Don't be afraid to wait until the time is right." 
A few final words - it takes far less time to become a PUA than to wait "until the time is right":) 'Nuff said:) Now have fun with 
the rest of this guide:) 
Ok, a few more final words - you are a MAN, you DO have sexual desires, no point in trying to deny that. Which... in fact is a 
good attitude to have:) "I make no excuses for my desires! I am a MAN goddammit! And I only laugh at the hypocrisy of the 
world!" So if some girl wrinkles her nose at this - you'll just convert her and she won't know how she could ever have thought 
differently from you:) 
But on the whole, as the point of seduction is to make the girls finally want to almost rape you, YOUR sexual desires should never 
even be a subject of discussion:)

Wanna play the dating game? Um… let's see…
Back to the Table of Contents
Actually, dates should be an exclusive reward and privilege of those girls that you're already sleeping with. But if you still decide 
to take her on a date before that… don't make it a date, say that you'll just get together. And make sure she pays for her 
coffee/drink/food. If she refuses, eject her - she was only interested in a chump who would buy her food/drinks. You can however 
suggest paying for rounds of beer/coffee in turns - for example, you'll pay for the first round, she the second etc. 
If you still insist on doing the classic date, here's a bit of advice (DD): 
"End the date before she does. You've gone to a movie and are now having a bite to eat at a restaurant [make sure she pays for her 
movie and for her meal; you don't want to be wasting your money until she has expressed her interest in you in a most convincing 
fashion - has had sex with you:)]. Instead of letting the date drag on to that awkward time when she finally says she has to go 
home, maintain control of the evening [you should be running patterns here, getting kino, making her feel connected to you, 
getting her horny and wet etc, but this whole dating advice is obviously intended for those lacking the appropriate skills:)]. While 
the conversation is still good, while the date is still going well, announce that it's getting late and it's time to go. Tell her that you 
enjoyed the evening [what a lie, your goal wasn't to stuff your stomach and see a movie, your goal was to tongue her down, make 
her horny like she'd never been and give her the orgasm of her life:)] and that you are looking forward to getting together again. 
This is going to surprise her, since every other guy thinks, that by some miracle, if he hangs on long enough that maybe he'll 
convince her to have sex with him [exactly, because "hanging on long enough" will accomplish nothing, but you should know 
better:)]. If a girl wants to have sex with you, she will let you know [and if you've done her right and can read her signs, then she 
has already given them to you:)]. So if you haven't gotten these vibes, end the date while it's still going well [but in fact if you 
haven't gotten those vibes in spite of all your advanced seduction attempts, you should have ejected her a long time ago:)]. You'll 
set yourself apart from the other guys she's used to [no you won't - they didn't get any and neither did you]. You demonstrate that 
you are not easy to get [or you'll demonstrate you're a chump and a wimp like "all the other guys"]." 
But honestly, avoid the whole dating thing. There are a zillion other ways to get to know to a girl than going on a "date". Do 
sports together, rent a movie (mmm:), have a cup of coffee, whatever, just avoid a "date". Get together - YES! Go on a date - NO!

The rules with your wingman
Back to the Table of Contents
NYC: "I tell all my wingmen up front that it's anything goes with the chicks. I am not going to try to take a chick that they are 
talking to, but if I am getting the vibe, I will give it ample time for my wing to reel her back in and get her. After that, it's full 
steam ahead! I will give him room because he's the one that found the chicks, but if he can't attract her and he's tried his whole 
bit... step aside my man... it's my turn:) Same thing if I am called in as the wing. I will fulfil my duty as wing as it is explained to 
me, but if the situation goes dynamic and the wrong chick is into me, your clock is ticking down... get her back on course to you 
or she's mine >:)" 
Update. Maxim (http://maximmag.com): 
"Danielle, 24, New Orleans: “I look to see that his guy friends are not total losers. If they are, then my friends are going to get 
stuck talking to them. Also, I think some guys purposely hang out with unattractive friends so they look like studs by comparison. 
It works against them—even if a guy is the best-looking one of the bunch, it just makes me think he’s the Head Nerd.”

Experiment!
Back to the Table of Contents
You could gobble up all the knowledge in the known universe about seduction but you'll neither never know what works best for 
you nor build up an intuition/experience concerning what would work best with any given girl - unless you start experimenting, 
both with what you've learned and what you come up with yourself. Plus this also helps to put you in the right mind-set. 
ASF: "The main thing I put my successes recently down to is the decision I made to have fun and make meeting women a game. 
Let's push their buttons this way and see how they respond. What will they do if I say this etc. When I meet someone I'm thinking 
"What can I learn from you? What fun can I have relating to you?" rather than "Wow, you're gorgeous. Oh shit! What do I say? 
Do I look OK? Will you like me? ", which are some of the thoughts that used to run through my mind in my AFC days."

Casual meetings vs pick-ups
Back to the Table of Contents
Girls love to meet their prince charming casually, they dream of meeting you accidentally and by chance. That usually includes 
meeting you at a somewhat more private party (a birthday or a wedding, but not a nightclub), being introduced to you through a 
mutual friend, having common interests (hobbies, sports etc) and meeting you through events organized for people practicing 
these interests; school, work, hobbies, friends, and relatives being the common denominators here. 
That is also why trying to pick up a girl in the street or on the commuter is so much harder to do than just "meeting her casually" - 
it is completely different from what she has been dreaming of and in addition to having to make her like you the way you present 
yourself, you'll have to compensate for not being able to have the silent recommendation of having mutual friends or hobbies plus 
dismiss any of her doubts of you "doing this (picking up girls) all the time", a thought which might weigh against you even if she 
actually likes you and your approach. 
But whether you want to make the girl like you having met her casually or doing a more direct pick-up, you'll be using the same 
techniques nevertheless. Opting for a casual meeting just simplifies your task of getting her to like you and has a higher 
probability of her coming to expect a LTR once things get serious (whether you like or want that to happen is already a different 
subject), whereas pick-ups are tougher to pull off successfully, but they also broaden your choice of girls far beyond those that 
you happen to meet "casually" plus each failure and succcess will build your experience and confidence respectively far more than 
casual meetings could ever do. 
In short, casual meetings are safe, pick-ups more rewarding, and the choice is yours, but a healthy mixture of both is probably the 
best way to go:)

At a party
Back to the Table of Contents
After you arrive, you can go with the 3s rule (recommended) or alternatively, Don Diebel: "Grab some food or a drink and notice 
what seems to be going on socially, what the dynamic seems to be, etc. The people who seem lost will be the easiest folk to flirt 
with. If you want to, you can assume that everyone is socially nervous, cut them some slack if things initially seem awkward and 
look for ways you can make people more comfortable." But honestly, it's much more fun to storm in with guns blazing using the 
3s rule:)

Fluff talk

Fluff talk
Back to the Table of Contents
Fluff talk is an important part of approaching a girl, especially if you plan to lauch into patterns, which you can't begin the 
conversation with on their own. Fluff talk is also needed, if you plan to continue with eliciting values - you must have had at least 
some sort of a casual conversation with the girl, for then it would sound only natural for you to have become a little more 
interested in her, to the point of asking all sorts of questions:) 
The number one rule of fluff talk is - direct the conversation towards and talk about FEELINGS. What fluff talk usually ends up 
being is an exchange of facts - "where ya goin?", "whatcha doin?", "what did you do today/yesterday?", "oh that's interesting". 
Facts are a BORE! Giving you her facts makes her feel NOTHING. Neither has she any use for the facts you are giving her. So 
grab any opportunity you have to get to feelings! 
"So what did you do yesterday?" 
"Oh I went skating" 
"You like skating?" 
"Yes:)" 
"Makes you feel good?:)" 
"Yeah:)" 
"I know what you mean..." 
And you go on to describe skating as the most liberating, beautiful, earth-shattering experience (that's what making up patterns on 
the fly is all about:). Or have her describe you her feelings herself, if she is a talker. Voila - you've switched from fluff talk to 
patterning in a blink of an eye:) 
She feels enthralled. But you don't know how to follow up on that. So let the the fluff talk continue. 
"So... em... have you eaten anything today?" 
"Yea, some sandwitches in the morning. Why?" 
"Well I was just hoping to pick up on some tips on how to have a delicious breakfast without having to spend too much time 
making it:) So you like sandwitches?" 
"Um... not really:) I just don't have time for much anything else:)" 
"But if you did, let's say you had your own personal cook, what would you like to start your morning with?" 
"Oh, well (salivating:), fried eggs and bacon, and a large cup of hot chocolate, and some marmalade (etc, let her describe it to her 
heart's content:)"

How to Lay Girls Guide
"Ah, that would really feel good wouldn´t it? Still lazily laying in your bed, to have all that delicious food brought to you on a 
silver tray - you take a sip of cocoa and can feel the pleasant warmth of it spreading thorughout your body, which after a good-
night's sleep is more fresh and receptive to the pleasentness of that feeling than usual, and you take a taste of marmalade and can 
feel it melting in your mouth and the sweetness of it waking you up for yet another wondeful day (etc, now make good use of all 
the food she HERSELF told you she likes:)" 
Once again - fluff talk to pattern talk in no time:) 
So the ability to fluff talk is essential, but not any kind of fluff talk will do. She can exchange facts with a million guys and not 
feel a thing. Or, she can give her facts to you and get a wonderful return on it:) But remember - FEELINGS:) 
Update. "So, what's *your* story?" 
A less feelings oriented and a more free-flowing approach to fluff-talk. By James L. King III, ASF: 
""So, what's *your* story?" - this is wonderful question that will get the other party talking. It's a good intro, or it can be used 
right after an opening line. 
I've used it several times to great effect, as the line usually gets women talking about how they got to the party, or what they do 
for a living, or about how they know the host, or why they chose to strip for a living. I learn a lot by paying attention to the subject 
matter of their answer. If it's about what they do for a living, then you know that's something important to them ... rapport material 
handed on a platter. If the woman doesn't mind sharing personal things about herself with you, this opening gives her the perfect 
opportunity, while at the same time allowing those women who are more reserved a chance to come up with something more 
benign, like "I'm a friend of the host." 
If they respond by not answering or looking dazed and confused or by saying that question makes them uncomfortable, I move on 
to someone else. People like that are no fun anyway, no matter how beautiful they may appear. 
Always be prepared to mirror the statements they give you ... if they reveal something personal about themselves, you can reveal 
something that's personal to you .. perhaps not the same thing, but something similar. This will feed the rapport between you as a 
relationship begins to develop. (This is also a good time to start your patterning language, if you don't do it naturally and turn it on 
or off as needed.) 
Also, if things aren't progressing so well with one person, remember that mingling means moving around ... don't stay with one 
person so long, otherwise you're not mingling. You can always return later. 
You can use the "story" approach not only with the person, but with accessories or special clothing the woman is wearing: 
examining a beautiful necklace, you can ask "so, what's the story behind the necklace?" 
The story approach doesn't work with un-special clothing: "So, what's the story behind those Levi's?" doesn't work as well as "So, 
what's the story behind that gorgeous hand-knit scarf?""

How to approach and introduce patterns into a discussion
Back to the Table of Contents
Obviously you just cannot sit down in front of or beside a girl you're not acquainted with and start with a pattern ready to plant 
anchors, listen to trance words etc. Here's where the skill of fluff talk comes to play. 
If you're witty, creative, observant or anything in that direction, you can use the casual "we know each other from before" 
approach and just start talking about the event you both just witnessed, something "new" you just noticed about her (never mind 
that she's "all new" to you anyway:), ask for her opinion about something, a new piece of clothing of yours etc. Just about 
anything goes as long as it doesn't look like an approach and a pick-up attempt - an impression which should initially be avoided 
at all costs. 
When things are going well, you can turn your interaction into a pick-up, but with more experience you can even have her do the 
pick-up (meaning she offers her phone-number and asks yours, when you seem to be leaving:). But once you have the 
conversation going, keep in mind that the general direction you want the conversation to go is the one which let's you introduce a 
pattern, and then another, and then another:) 'Til she's dripping wet or goes unconscious from all the highs you are taking her:) 
A natural conversation hops from one thing to another and can be fulfilling if the subject being discussed is thrilling to both 
parties of the conversation. Pick your hops so as to move closer to being able to naturally introduce a pattern but be also very 
sensitive to the hops she takes and change you goals accordingly - choose another pattern to eventually end up with, modify the 
one you had in mind or in your final stage of mastery of SS: make up and deliver an appropriate one on the fly:) 
See also the on SS in the July'98 issue of Playboy. The article is a good example of how starting with patterns right at the outset is 
a doomed approach, they just sound too lame and embarrassing. But the one time the journalist does it right, starts with some fluff 
talk, has the "actually we know each other" attitude, comments on something which has some sort of understandable meaning for 
the girl and only THEN delivers a pattern he made up on the fly about it and - BOOM, it works!

Speed Seduction - Article from PLAYBOY - July '98

The paradigm shift the journalist experiences is a good indicator of what to expect should you consider trying out for the first time 
either patterning or any other seduction technique described in this guide:) 
The article is also good example of how starting with patterns right at the outset is a doomed approach, they just sound too lame

An article by Peter Alson: 
"Tired of love taking its sweet time? Ross Jeffries Tells you how to cut to the chase. The Phone wakes me. It's 8:15 A.M. and I'm 
still groggy as the machine picks up. A mysterious female voice invades my bedroom. "Hey, Peter, this is Vanessa. You called me 
and left a very compelling-psychologically compelling-message." Suddenly I am wide-awake, sitting up in bed, giddy and slightly 
in shock.. 
Jesus, it worked. 
I feel like the skeptic who finds out that a magic potion actually does what the snake-oil salesman said it would do. Let me 
explain: A few days ago I began listening to a set of tapes titled Advanced Speed-Seduction, 13 hours of instruction in the art of 
getting laid, taught by a California geek turned lothario named Ross Jeffries. On the tapes, Jeffries says that for practice he 
sometimes leaves messages on women's voice mail, and that he has devised one that never fails to get a response. 
After having wasted a bit too much time trying to snag the perfect woman, I admit to being intrigued by the concept of seduction 
and speed in tandem. The personal-ad gambit seemed the ideal litmus test to Jeffries' claims, a safe and anonymous way to try out 
his "speed seduction" patterns. So yesterday I called a personals 900 line advertised in The New York Observer, listened to a 
number of voices and selected Vanessa. ("Hi, fellows. I'm looking for a guy who's looking for a girl who likes to read Baudelaire 
in bed and take long, luxurious baths and is not afraid to say what's on her mind.") 
But first a confession: A year ago, on an evening when browsing personal ads was not part of a magazine assignment, I left a 
phone reply to another woman's advertisement, in which I described myself in a straightforward manner as a Harvard-educated 
journalist who likes travel and adventure. Surely, I thought, she would be impressed by the resume and my sensitive, honest voice. 
I am still waiting to hear from her. 
Rewind to yesterday and my Jeffries-scripted message to Vanessa, spoken in a bedroom voice, with lots of suggestive pauses: 
"Vanessa, have you ever been really attracted to a man's voice while listening to your messages? And the warmth of that voice 
just began to wrap itself around you and penetrate your thoughts? You began to have certain ideas. And maybe as you allowed 
that warmth to heat up into a fire, and as your heart began to pound with the excitement of that, you realized there's something 
you've got to have, deep inside. You know this is true. So listen, I really liked your message and if you find yourself reaching for 
the phone, I just want you to know that you should take all the time you need in the next 30 seconds. Here's my phone number." 
You realized there's something you've got to have, deep inside?Are you kidding me? Did I actually say that? Did she actually 
respond? Just to be sure, I ask a friend to call and leave her a normal message. In other words, to be my control group. Five days 
after her psychologically compelled response to me, he still awaits a reply.

Despite my glee at this, I'm in no hurry to establish in-person contact with Vanessa. For one thing, I'm not sure what to say to her 
for an encore (I haven't listened to all the tapes yet); for another, I don't want to puncture the fantasy, which right now is perfect. 
Like almost all ordinary guys who have seen a beer commercial, this is my fantasy: to be able to seduce any woman I want simply 
by talking to her. Since I don't look like Mel Gibson or have Bill Gates' money, words are my only hope. The fact is, I have 
known lotharios whose only special attribute was a good rap. I had a friend in college whose success with women was mind-
boggling, given his Napoleonic stature and receding hairline. I tried to emulate him; we talked about strategy and approaches. But 
his gift was his and I could never get it to rub off on me. I wasn't hopeless, I just found that whenever I got anywhere with a 
woman, it was a mysterious occurrence, an accident. My friend would ask, "Did you get lucky?" not only because that was the 
euphemism we used but because luck was the only reasonable explanation for my occasional success. The knack, I concluded, 
isn't something you can learn. 
That is, I thought so until I got Vanessa's message. 
Had I always been wrong? Ross Jeffries certainly thinks so. Nine years ago, as a failed comedy writer, he penned a self-help book 
called How to Get the Women You Desire Into Bed: A Down and Dirty Guide to Dating and Seduction for the Man Who's Fed 
Up With Being Mr. Nice Guy that gave a Nineties twist to the Seventies Eric Weber (How to Pick Up Girls) approach. 
Warming to his subject, Jeffries combined some of the ideas from his book with the principles of neurolinguistic programming 
and began developing Speed Seduction. Neurolinguistic programming, co-founded by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, is an 
approach to psychotherapy that used language patterns and metaphor to communicate with the unconscious mind. 
For Jeffries, a self-confessed nerd, the development of Speed Seduction was a personal triumph. By breaking down the art of 
seduction into patterns of speech and word formations that would eliminate chance, he transformed himself into the Don Juan he 
had always dreamed of becoming. The concept also became a small cottage empire for Jeffries. The home study tapes go for as 
high as $345, the video version is $195, and the three-day "get laid" workshops he teaches several times a year will lighten your 
wallet to the tune of $895. He also markets other paraphernalia to help shy guys snag women, including a handwriting analysis 
prop that is called the Grapho-Deck and a video titled Flirting With Magic. 
When combined with his overheated back-of-the-comic-book sales pitches ("How to Totally Mind-Fuck almost Any Woman Into 
Screwing Your Brains Out and Make It Seem Like You're Just Having a Normal, Innocent Conversation!"), one might easily 
conclude that Jeffries is just a cheap huckster trying to take advantage of lonely, horny guys. 
"Talk to my students," he said to me when I raised the issue. "Is it 'taking advantage' if the stuff works?" And while he admits that 
about 30 percent of his followers are "what you would expect them to be," he claims the other 70 percent are "edge junkies." 
"They want to beat the system and they don't want to play the dating game. I teach them how to get that edge." 
Jeffries tells his students that "women don't really want a guy with a great body, a handsome face or lots of money. What women 
want is the emotional states they experience when they are around a guy with a great body, a handsome face, etc." And he 
guarantees he can show them how to create these states "in virtually any woman, using simple but powerful language patterns." 
Among the NLP crowd, Jeffries is not the most popular guy, the feeling being that he is using their great invention not for good 
but for evil. Nevertheless, his teachings have elicited delirious testimonials from his students: "I used your 'have you ever weasel 
pattern to score my ultimate fantasy: two girls in bed at the same time! Thanks!" Hayden Basanta, Winnipeg, Manitoba; "Using 
your 'instantaneous connection' pattern, I got a bikini model in bed the same night I met her." John Kent, Woodland Hills, 
California; "Not to brag, Ross, she has a boyfriend or husband or if I'm her type nothing matters! You're a fucking genius!" Mark 
Cunningham, Maumee, Ohio. 
Whatever qualms I have about Jeffries and the concept of using conscious manipulation to seduce women (certainly many of my 
friends, especially the women, find Jeffries' ideas repellent), I wonder if I can really claim to stand on Higher moral ground. I 
mean, when I go out with a woman I've just met, don't I take care in selecting the clothes I wear? In choosing the right restaurant? 
Do I not tell her things I think will impress her, stories that have made other girls laugh and admire my wit? 
Is that any less contrived or manipulative than what Jeffries teaches? OK, maybe I'm not using someone else's words. But is that 
even true? I've uttered lines from Gide and Whitman as if they were my own; I've repeated things friends have said that I thought

were clever or interesting; I've affected other people's style, the cool way Jean Paul Belmondo rubbed his thumb on his lower lip 
in Breathless or the way Bogart inhaled his cigarette. And why? To get laid, of course. 
Listening to the tapes, my slight queasiness about morality gives way to my real fear: that I am seeking help in scoring chicks 
because I'm some kind of loser geek. I can picture my fellow geeks at Jeffries' seminars as they sit in masking-taped glasses, 
discussing the science of getting laid. Jeffries says that everything he teaches is designed to "capture and lead the imagination," 
but some of the strategies and language patterns sound as if they were lifted straight out of a Saturday Night Live sketch about 
seduction. There are "blammo" patterns and "weasel" phrases. The "boyfriend destroyer." And, of course, the "blow job" pattern, 
in which the would-be Speed Seducer says to an unsuspecting target, "I used to think my best ideas came from above me, but now 
I know they come from below me." 
As in blow me. 
I'm not kidding. 
Jeffries is defensive about this material. When I talk to him by telephone, he says, "Don't knock this stuff until you try it. The 
metaphor I use is fishing you don't bait the hook with the kind of food you like to eat, you bait it with what the fish are going to 
bite on." 
Will the fish bite if, beyond "below me," you pepper your conversation with words such as "penetrate," " come inside," "hard" and 
"surrender," as Jeffries suggests? I don't know, but I'm of the opinion that if you use the right inflection, as he also suggests, and 
pause mid-sentence to create a sense of anticipation and mystery, it's possible. 
I ask Bruce Goldberg, hypnotist and author of Soul Healing and New Age Hypnosis, if sexual double entendres and embedded 
commands can work. He says, "Numerous studies have been done, and they've shown that you can't make someone violate moral 
and ethical codes. However, if you're dealing with a woman you're attracted to, and she's neutral, or not opposed to you if she's 
acting like 'If he shows me something, I'll give him a shot' that's a different story. Particularly if she's in a naturally altered state 
for instance, if she's jogging or listening to music. Now, those embedded commands might sway her. They might make the 
difference. If she's open but doesn't want to make the first move because of her puritanical upbringing or whatever, the right 
words can make the difference, absolutely." 
I remember my college friend playfully turning every conversation with a girl, no matter where she would try to steer it, into 
something with sexual undertones. He'd get her thinking about sex, and pretty soon she was thinking about having sex with him. 
I am also aware that the gulf between the sexes is large enough that language that seems ridiculous to me might not seem that way 
to someone without a penis (or "ha-penis"). As Jeffries says, the proof is in the pudding ("deep inside" it). After all, most men find 
romance novels laughable, but there is a huge female audience for them. 
A friend of mine wrote a romance novel once, and as part of his preparation he was instructed by his publisher to read Nancy 
Friday's My Secret Garden, a book in which women talk about their sexual fantasies. Additionally, he was made to include a 
scene in which the heroine was served her lover in the form of a stew (my friend referred to this as the "praying mantis" scene). 
He was dumbfounded, having never engaged in a sexual fantasy that involved cannibalism (even the unwitting variety). But what 
left him baffled apparently struck some chord in women. The book sold more than 300,000 copies. 
I mention this in part because one of Jeffries' followers actually recommends romance novels as a source of powerful language 
patterns. "I admit these books are difficult," says Mark (the housewife banger) Cunningham, "because you're reading through 
them and you're going, 'What the fuck are they talking about?' But if you lift some of the ideas and the language from them and 
say them in a slow, relaxed and powerful manner, women melt. They've finally found a man who knows how to communicate 
with them in a meaningful way." 
Jeffries also advocates reading women's magazines to better understand the female psyche. It all comes down to knowing who 
you're trying to seduce. Jeffries says, "When most men meet a beautiful woman, they're so wrapped up in their own feelings that 
they neglect what the woman is feeling. If you want to be successful with women, focus on their state, not yours." Pay attention, 
in other words to something besides the thing in your pants.

"If you listen to what a woman says, she'll give you all the information you need to seduce her," Jeffries continues. Often his 
technique consists of extracting that information with a series of questions that begin with what he calls his "weasel" phrase "If 
you were to..., "If I were to..., "Have you ever...," etc. 
For example, you might say to a woman, "If I were to ask you" the implication being that you're not really asking "what's the most 
important thing in a relationship, how would you describe it to me?" In listening to her response, you would pay particular 
attention to her "trance" words the words she puts particular emphasis on or repeats frequently (e.g., "I want a man who makes me 
feel comfortable with myself") then simply mirror her answers to her in the same language: "Wouldn't it be nice if you could 
spend time with a man who makes you feel like you could let down your guard and just be comfortable? Whose voice soothed and 
at the same time stimulated you? I get the feeling that this could happen to you right now, with me." 
"The effect of this kind of pattern is powerful," says Jeffries, "and it gives the woman the sense of having an incredible connection 
with you."Instinctively, this makes sense to me. Most men don't listen; so obviously those who do (and who prove it by mirroring 
what they've heard) are going to score some points. Does it matter whether you are listening because you are genuinely interested, 
or just listening because you have an agenda (to get laid)? As Jeffries says only half-jokingly, quoting George Burns, "Sincerity is 
everything. And once you learn how to fake that, you've got it made." Eager to test out what I've learned from the tapes, I visit a 
Barnes & Noble Cafe near my office, which is listed in the Zagat Guide to New York restaurants with the warning: "Good coffee, 
but beware of Casanovas." 
I find a table where a dark-eyed young woman in skintight black pants and black boots is reading a magazine. 
"Do you mind if I sit down?" I ask her tentatively. She barely shrugs. She's got the high cheekbones of a model and a red-lip-
sticked mouth that Mick Jagger might envy. I've made some notes from Jeffries' tapes and I open my notebook to do a last-second 
cram. Then I launch into my spiel. 
"Excuse me," I say to her. She looks up, eyeing me like I'm something that was left in her refrigerator too long. "I just have to tell 
you this," I continue. 
"You are absolutely stunning." 
She keeps looking at me coldly. I bravely forge onward. 
"I'm Peter Alson. Did you ever meet somebody for the first time and just feel absolutely comfortable with them?" 
Without saying anything, she gets up, picks up her cappuccino and moves to the other side of the cafe. 
I'm just following a script, I want to shout after her. I would never tell a woman that stuff about feeling absolutely comfortable 30 
seconds after meeting her. Really! 
A glutton for punishment, I try out this rap a couple more times, improvising slightly to make it less jarring. The results are better 
but still not great. I don't get kicked, spit at or arrested, but beyond getting more comfortable with approaching and talking to 
strange women, I'm batting zero. 
At dinner later, with a friend who is much amused by my stories, I am asked for a demonstration of Speed Seduction. I decide to 
have a go at our waitress, using a different Jeffries approach. Waitresses are the perfect test, actually. They have to talk to you. 
But if they are attractive (as ours is statuesque, blonde, with a cute English-girl overbite), you can be reasonably sure they get hit 
on all the time and are well practiced in the art of the polite but efficient brush-off. 
I notice that our waitress' voice has an odd inflection, so I use that observation as my low-key opening. "I was just wondering 
where you're from. You have an interesting accent." 
She tells me she's from a place on the Canadian border. "Really?" I say. "Is that a small town? How many people?" She doesn't 
know, and after she moves on to another table, my friend says, "She probably can't count that high." 
But she seems sweet, and she's extremely pretty, and when she comes back to take our order a few minutes later, I go into the next 
phase. "You must get awfully tired by the end of the night," I say. She nods, taking a deep breath.

"Do you ever get a chance to go on vacation?" "I went home for a couple of weeks over the summer. Does that count?" "Hmm, 
not really. But I'm curious: If you were to take a real vacation in your ideal spot, what would it be like?" 
I get the feeling she's surprised to be asked a question like this, and intrigued. A light comes into her blue eyes as she describes 
her ideal place, a lush, tropical island where drinks are served on the beach in coconut shells. It's a pretty pedestrian fantasy, but 
her manner is charming as she spins it out, and in a way it's as if I've taken her there. I've flown her out of this restaurant to a hot 
beach in the Caribbean where she's getting drunk! A few minutes later, I see her standing by the bar with another waitress. They're 
looking at our table as they talk. When she brings our entrees, she puts them down and says, "And what about you? If your ideal 
vacation spot, what would it be?" 
My friend is impressed by her willing participation in my seduction demonstration. I am as well. It's like we've mixed up some 
chemicals in a laboratory and the test tube is beginning to spew smoke. 
"Before I answer that," I say, "let me ask you something else. You know that feeling you have when you get home after a hard day 
of work and all you can think about is stripping off your clothes and sliding into a hot bath or taking a shower?" I'm shocked I'm 
saying this, but she seems OK with it. "Which do you prefer?" I ask. "Bath or shower?" "Bath."
"You know how sometimes, before you even get in, you imagine the heat just working its way through every part of your body 
and then you actually slide in, and that warmth just takes you and you surrender to it?"
My friend is looking at me. I can feel his struggle to contain his hysteria.
"Oh my God," he finally says, laughing, as the waitress again travels out of earshot. "What?"
"You know, you're actually kind of scary with that stuff."
"What do you mean?"
"It sounds so natural coming out of your mouth."
I don't know if this is intended as an insult, but I have to admit I enjoyed my little performance. Because I was looking at the 
whole thing as an experiment and parroting someone else's words, it didn't feel like my ego was on the line the way it normally 
does. 
Maybe that's the key. If I don't get over with her, it won't be a personal rejection of me. She just didn't go for the material. Jeffries 
emphasizes this point in the tapes. "Don't worry about results," he says more than once. "Just have fun trying the stuff out." 
"So how do you close the deal?" my friend asks.
"Watch," I say. When the waitress comes back, I ask her what her name is. She tells me it's Sandy. I say, "Well, Sandy, it's really 
been fun talking to you. It's too bad that we won't get the chance to do it again without all these distractions and interruptions."
She nods but doesn't take the bait. No problem. On my way out, I go up to her and say, "You know, I meant what I said about it 
being fun talking to you. Maybe we could meet for coffee sometime. Like tomorrow?" "I can't this week," she says. "I'm in a play 
this week."
"Really?"
"You should come," she says. She writes down the information for me.
Not bad, but too involved. Going to a play doesn't fit into the Speed Seduction formula. The whole point is to avoid extended 
courtship (besides, the play might stink). In the language of Jeffries, I'm on a fishing trip, and I want to see if I can land something 
quickly. I'm not going to get hung up on any one fish. Over the next few days, I go to coffee shops, bars and department stores. I 
even try a street pickup. I get a few more nibbles but don't manage to reel anyone in. Curious, I tell one girl, after she blows me 
off, that I am writing an article; I ask her to explain her response. She says, "Oh, I don't know," and repeats with disdain the lines I 
approached her with: "'I have an intuition about you'? 'I think you're a very visual person'? It's a little lame, don't you think?" 
I do. To me that's the main drawback of Speed Seduction: The actual language tends to drift too often into the areas of lame and 
embarrassing. It's not only the language Jeffries teaches but the language he uses in his teaching: "I 'morphed' it." "I 'time 
distorted' it." "Let's 'chunk' for a minute." Chunk? Even in California it's not a happy concept. 
All the same, I can't help thinking that it's good that Jeffries is helping propel guys like me, making us feel bold enough to 
approach strange women. Truth is, most successful seducers I've known don't hit for a high average. James Toback, the writer and 
director of The Pickup Artist, whom I met in Los Angeles in 1980, was as compulsive and tireless in his pursuit of women as 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/pbarticle.htm (5 of 8) [8/3/2002 9:31:57 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
anyone I've ever seen, and a lot said no. But Toback told me he never took rejections personally: "If someone didn't respond to 
me, the only effect was to make me think I was wrong about her, that I had made a mistake." 
As Jeffries says, "The difference between losers and winners is that losers don't fail enough." And he's right. You have to step up 
to the plate. If it's not your natural inclination, than having a strategy is helpful and using suggestive language is good. Even if the 
NLP stuff is a gimmick, a lot of late-night hooey, you'd be better off out there using it than you would be at home in front of the 
television, watching the infomercial. 
I know better than to bore a woman with "What do you do?" questions, or, worse, with self-involved this-is-what-I-do 
monologues if I'm making them interested in me. The goal is to engage their imaginations. To intrigue. I want to create rapport 
and understanding. I mean, isn't that what everybody wants? To feel understood? What could possibly be more seductive than 
that? 
On the subway a few mornings later, I find myself squeezed in beside a blonde in a navy peacoat, who's peeling an orange and 
putting the peels into a brown paper bag on her lap. Before my recent experiences, I wouldn't have dreamed of talking to a woman 
on the subway. It's just too tough, the K2 of pickups. But there's something about this blonde in the peacoat maybe that she's 
unselfconscious enough to eat in public that makes her seem approachable. 
"I I'm just curious," I say to her in my best Warren Beatty stutter. "Where'd you get that orange?"
"What?"
"I'm just curious where you got that orange. See, I really love oranges, but this time of year I have trouble finding good ones. That 
looks like a really good one you have there."
She shrugs, chewing on a section, keeping her eyes focused straight ahead.
At least she doesn't reach for a can of Mace.
"So . . . Do you have some special place?"
"No. You just have to know what to look for," she mumbles. I'm making her nervous. We rumble into a station. The doors open.
"You mean the good ones are there among all the others, but only you can tell the difference?"
"Mm-hmm." There's the barest hint of a smile, followed by a brief moment of eye contact. The doors close and the train lurches 
up to speed.
"Well, that's amazing. How can you tell? What's the secret?"
"No secret," she says.
"Is it just the way they feel? The way they look?"
"Both."
"Hmm . . . I think you're being too modest. I mean, this is an important skill."
She laughs and looks at me, but again just for a moment.
"Because, really," I say, "there's nothing better than a good orange. You know? The kind where you bite into it and it's sweet and 
juicy, and it's almost like you can't get enough do you know that feeling?" She nods.
"Is that what you're feeling right now? I mean, with me . . . if I find that perfect orange, I'm just I get transported...."
She's looking at me now, no incidental eye contact, and I'm thinking to myself, This is working. I'm not sure where I'm going 
from here, but this is working.
As she starts gathering herself, I ask, "Is this your stop?"
"Yeah."
"That's funny."
"Why, is it your stop, too?"
"No, but it will be if you'll let me buy you a cup of coffee."
She shakes her head and smiles. "OK."
Just like that. "OK."
It's like the "Jedi mind" shit that Vince Vaughn did to the Vegas cocktail waitress in the movie Swingers.
The funny part is that I immediately start sweating. I know that I'm supposed to be concentrating on her state, but shock has 
momentarily obliterated my powers of concentration.
So what happens next?
Well, I'm tempted to claim that after a couple cups of caffeine we make a beeline for the nearest bed. That would be a good 
ending. But the truth is we sit and talk (a lot) and I discover she'' an NYU graduate student who takes her coffee black with sugar, 
that she likes to read Baudelaire and her name is . . . Vanessa.
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/pbarticle.htm (6 of 8) [8/3/2002 9:31:57 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
That would be a good ending too, wouldn't it?
(Parenthetical note for the curious: I did call back Vanessa of the voice mail. We even got together for coffee. But that was where 
my curiosity and her psychological compulsion ended.)
As for my subway baby, her name is Ruth (well, it is as long as I have to change it for this story) and she is a graduate student. 
She has a small gap between her front teeth, a charming habit of brushing her hair away from her face with one hand, and green 
eyes that remind me of a girl I once loved. Also, she talks extremely fast and her parents divorced when she was three (she grew 
up with her mother in Schenectady; her older brother grew up with their father in Albany) and if she could imagine her ideal 
vacation spot it would be . . . well, I didn't get around to that. See, what happens is, we're sitting there in this cafw, and she squints 
a little at me and says, "OK, so have you ever done that before, picked up somebody on the subway?"
And I tell her no, though I can't quite suppress a smile.
She doesn't believe me.
"I'll bet you're one of those guys who goes around picking up girls all the time, aren't you?" she says. Now I'm laughing and she 
says, "What?" and I shake my head.
"No, come on," she says. "You really can't do that."
I look at her and she looks at me with those luminous green eyes.
"And you probably don't even like oranges," she says.
At which point the urge is too strong, I can't help myself, I want to share the joke with her.
"Look, there's something that I want to tell you, but I'm afraid if I do, you won't like me."
"What? Is it bad?"
"No, but---"
"Then you have to tell me."
So I spill the beans. I tell her about Speed Seduction, the article I'm writing. 
There are a tense couple of moments while she digests it all. Then she laughs.
"You mean I fell for it?"
"Well, not really. I mean, the stuff about oranges wasn't actually from the course, it was just me." "But it worked. I'm here with 
you."
"So you feel duped?"
She thinks about it. "I'm not sure."
"Don't. I mean, I'm really glad you're here, and if I weren't doing this piece, I never would have had the nerve to talk to you."
"But now I am going to wonder if everything you're telling me is just a line."
I start to laugh again and she joins in. "I guess I blew it, didn't I?" I say.
"Why? You really think I'd go right to bed with some guy I just met in the subway anyway?"
"I don't know."
"You really don't know?"
"I'm sure that you probably wouldn't. You know what the crazy part is? Women have The Rules, which tells them to put off 
sleeping with a guy if they want to make him fall for them, and men have Speed Seduction, which tells us not to date a woman 
until after we have had sex. I think that if you meet the right person it doesn't really matter what you do."
"Really?"
"Sure, it's probably doomed either way."
She looks at me.
"That's a joke."
"So is that what you want to do?"
"Well, Ross Jeffries would probably kill me, but would you like to have dinner with me?"
She twists up her mouth for a moment. "When?"
"Tomorrow?"
"I think we should wait."
"For what?"
"For you to finish your article."
"You mean so I can call the article Slow Seduction."
What can I say, Ross? Even in the land of fast everything, some things are just worth waiting for."

(Originated by Don Diebel) 
G     Do not talk about any of your personal (family, work, money) problems. 
G     Don't act desperate. 
G     Don't talk about anything negative at all. Keep everything you talk about upbeat and positive. 
G     Don't get drunk. This really turns women off and makes a bad impression. Don't drink at all or limit your drinking to a 
couple of drinks. 
G     Don't try to analyse her problems. 
G     Don't bitch about your previous girlfriends or ex-wives on how they mistreated you, dumped you, cheated on you, took 
you to the cleaners on child support, etc. 
G     Don't pretend to be funny or humorous. If you are putting on an act, it will come across to her as phoney. Just be friendly 
and smile (but in appropriate doses, avoid having a grin on your face ALL THE TIME, guys that are smiling for hours in a 
row look terribly insecure and just plain pathetic). 
G     Don't focus on your health problems or ailments. 
G     Don't brag about yourself and your accomplishments. There are exceptions though, but try to be careful about them. If you 
really have something impressive to talk about, you can let her in on it, just try to be real casual about it. On the whole, 
women are very good at sniffing out when the male is trying to impress them by bragging. And if what he is bragging 
about is not really that impressive, it's a complete turn-off. So be careful. Focusing on her and her interests is a far safer 
route to take.

otherwise wonderful interaction.

Just say "Hi"
Back to the Table of Contents
This is a really simple strategy. If you're consistent and persistent with this strategy, this could yield you a lot of beautiful women. 
It'll take a long time though, but then again, it requires almost no effort on your part:) 
Here's what you do. You see a girl you like, but for some reason can't do an approach (you don't have the time, or maybe the guts, 
or the situation disallows it etc), at least do this - say "Hi". Keep enough eye-contact to get a confused "Hi" in return, then 
continue with what you were doing (walking, working etc). Maybe you'll never see the girl again. But if you do (oh joy and 
behold!:) - say "Hi" again. Then continue with what you were doing (basically, ignoring her:). And so on, and so on. After the 
first three "Hi's" the girl is still wondering, if or how she is supposed to know you. After the fifth "Hi" she is already wondering, 
how come you never actually talk to her. After the tenth "Hi" she can't understand, how come you never even approach her. After 
the twentieth "Hi" she is so confused and intrigued about you that she just can't stand it anymore and will approach YOU instead. 
She'll try to find out how the two of you know, and why you never talk to her, or why you never even approach her, but you still 
keep saying "Hi", is there something wrong with her etc - be very vague and mysterious about it in your answers (after all, you 
don't have much to tell anyway:). Now however, you're talking to an absolutely gorgeous girl (remember, you almost didn't even 
have the guts to say "Hi" to her:), who is so intrigued about you the she approached you - make the best of it:) 
So the good part of this tactic is - almost zero effort on your part, just remember saying "Hi" to her:) The downsides however are 
numerous - you might never see her again, which is especially bad if she became interested in you when you said your first "Hi" 
already. Or you might see her a few more times but not on a consistent enough basis to build up enough intrigue in her. Also, this 
takes a monstrous amount of time to ripen - months, possibly even years. Neither is it much of a confidence- and experience-
builder - you'll develop a confidence of saying "Hi" to beauties (not much is it?:) and acquire no experience whatsoever. But it 
serves it purpose as a last-ditch resort when you see a 10 approaching down the street, hurrying somewhere - say "Hi", get one in 
return, make her think that the two of you know each other somehow (obviously she can't remember you:) and hope for another 
chance meeting (when she hopefully still vaguely remembers you:). 
A modification of this tactic (which seems to make some more sense) - just say "Hi" to any girl you like. Yes, any girl and 
anywhere - the commuter, the street, the airport, the corridor, the cafeteria. Some won't answer (maybe you greeted her too late for 
her to notice you), some answer, some smile and answer (see also Eye contact experiment), some answer, smile and stop (!) to 
initiate conversation with you (most probably about how come you know her when she doesn't seem to be able to remember you 
from anywhere:). 
The ones that you have exchanged "Hi"-s with (without ever being introduced to each other or having actually approached her) 
are the best to use the "We already know each other" tactic with. The next time you meet, just start in the middle, like with an old 
friend, comment on something/anything etc, she responds and BOOM - you're acquintances! 
Ok, so that's still a long way from having her naked body between your sheets - but you've made a start and you're already well on 
your way:)

Eye contact experiment
Back to the Table of Contents
by David Shade 
I asked one woman friend of mine "why did you go out with him?" and she replied: "because when I looked at him he kept eye 
contact with me." 
When I recall the very successful people I have had the pleasure of working for in the corporate world, I remember that they all 
maintained eye contact while speaking to me. When you watch somebody successful being interviewed on TV, like Scott 
McNealy of Sun, you notice that they never look away from their interviewer's eyes and they rarely blink. 
You are approaching a chick in the hall as you walk towards each other. When should you look at her? (Her eyes, silly. If you 
look at anything else, it's over.) I have tried all combinations. If I wait until the last instant, I either find she is not looking, or, if 
she is looking, she quickly looks away. If I look at her and she looks at me and I look away, then she never looks again. Then I 
tried something bold and decide I will look at her eyes the entire time. To my amazement, she gazes like a deer into headlights. 
Never breaks eye contact. So I decide to try this little experiment. 
Recently I spent a week attending meetings in one of our buildings filled with educated successful professional women in their 
20's and 30's. Most are definitely doable. Some are gorgeous. Some are married, some are not. I spent my time between meetings 
trying this: I would pick a different floor and I would walk down each hall, walking just slightly to the right of center. When I saw 
a woman walking towards me, I maintained looking at her eyes. Only the heavy ones did not keep looking. But for all the others, 
including the gorgeous ones, they maintained eye contact the entire time. I never blinked. They never blinked. They broke eye 
contact only when we were just about next to each other. I broke eye contact only after she did. What really amazed me was that 
by the time we passed, almost every chick had broken a smile. Some even said "Hi." I did not smile or say Hi until they first did. 
These halls were not long. Each woman was no farther than 30 feet away when I first saw her. But what if it had been a very long 
hall? How far down the hall should I start looking at her eyes? I certainly don't want to scare her. I look straight ahead, and then 
when she is about 30 feet away, I start looking into her eyes. 
I then went to the mall a few times to try the experiment there. Most did not look at all. Of those who did look, most only looked 
for a second. Only about a third locked on. Of those, about half broke a smile or said Hi. A couple of them where so moved that 
they almost tripped. 
Do you have to be walking? I tried the experiment while sitting. Almost none maintained eye contact. Do they have to be 
walking? While I was walking I would look at any chicks who were sitting. The results were the same as if we were both walking. 
If I was approaching two chicks, and looked from one to the other, I lost them both. So, if I am in such a situation, I lock onto one 
and I don't change my mind. 
If I smiled or said Hi, while she was still looking at me, but before she smiled or said Hi, it would usually result in my loosing her. 
On rare instances did it make her smile and say Hi with enthusiasm. So, I never smile or say Hi until she first does so, and I smile 
if she smiles and say Hi if she says Hi. 
If she did not lock eye contact with me, I would go ahead and say Hi when she got close to me. In many instances she would then

enthusiastically turn to me and smile and say Hi. 
I would also look at chicks who were with a man if he was not looking in my general direction. I was surprised at the number of 
times that she would lock on and actually smile. 
I noticed that the better I dressed, or the sexier I dressed, the better I did. I noticed that the women who looked where better 
dressed then those who did not. 
Eye contact in a bar is an entire science in itself. When done correctly, it can be fucking lethal. 
Real players never stare. They lock eye contact. There is a difference between staring and locking eye contact. They are two 
totally different things. 
When you look at a woman, here is what you do. Lock eye contact with her. Don't blink. Don't look at her friend. Pick one eye 
and don't let go. You only get one chance at this. Don't give up. Don't smile. Don't say anything. You are telling her that you are 
interested in her and you are not intimidated by her. Then leave it up to her. You will be amazed at the staring capability that 
women posses. 
She is thinking "Who is this guy to be so bold as to continue looking at me while I look at him? Now this is interesting. He is 
different." She knows that if she lets go now, she will loose you. She will go one of two ways. If she wants to loose you, she will 
break eye contact and look away. If she does not want to loose you, but is instead intrigued by what you are doing, she knows that 
she has to eventually end the stare down and she will have to make the move. She will have to either smile or say Hi. 
If she smiles, you smile. If she says Hi, you say Hi. Don't say Hello. Then you reward her and make your move. 
Of course, you don't always have to wait for eye contact to make your move. 
Update. David Shade, ASF: "When you are talking to a woman, always maintain eye contact. This demonstrates confidence and 
intent. Don't theorize about it, just do it. Pick one eye and stick with it. Don't go from eye to eye, that is nervous. That can only be 
done with great skill as she will associate eye changes to content. 
The only time you do not look a woman in the eyes is when you are "motioning away" as you mention something "bad", such as 
her borefriend. Anything "bad" is associated with "looking away." 
That is after you have already started talking to her. But what about before that? Again - always remain in eye contact. Let her be 
the first to break eye contact. Then make your approach. It does not matter what the setting is. It is universal."

General guidelines on approaching
Back to the Table of Contents
Use humour to get you started - or even give you a head-start:) Ross Jeffries: "Let's talk about using humour for a minute. Not 
only do most women LOVE a guy who can make them laugh; laughing shifts a woman's physiology and mental focus, 
interrupting her thought patterns and creating a temporary blank, which YOU can then fill in. Just think about it a second. Have 
you ever been in a rotten mood, and then a friend suddenly makes you laugh? What happens? You start feeling a hell of a lot 
better, don't you?" What Ross Jeffries suggests as an almost perfect approach is using a humorous comment to get her to laugh, 
then all you have to do is to follow up with anything to keep the conversation flowing towards a possibly pattern-like talk, 
eliciting values or any other technique described in this guide you have chosen to use. 
You can even border on slightly negging her, if you go Mystery-style with a drop-dead gorgeous girl, or smutty, if you go GM-
style, but those two are already more advanced techniques. If however you are dealing with a nice and cute (of 7 or 8 on a scale 
of 10), you can also make her feel good by complimenting her looks for starters (see Negging for why this is not such a good 
idea with a drop-dead gorgeous model-type babe of 10). 
Update. Speed Seduction newsletter, Ross Jeffries: "For me, one of my favorite ways to meet women is to use some type of 
humorous approach that gets her laughing. Why is this so important? 
1.  Laughter sets a woman at ease and puts her off guard. 
2.  Getting her laughing shows that you are confident and don't take the process of meeting her too seriously, unlike a 
desperate hard-up loser HAS to succeed, YOU are a fun guy, enjoying your exciting life and creating an opportunity for 
HER to step into it and have some fun too?IF she plays her cards right. 
3.  Humor is a way to test to see if SHE has a personality. If she is a mean, unhappy be-yatch, why bother? 
4.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, LAUGHTER GIVES YOU A BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE from her that you can mention, 
incorporate, and future pace into HER IMAGINING CONTINUING TO HAVE FUN WITH YOU LATER! 
Offer entertainment and confidence with speed. ASF: "As far as you are concerned the girl has to be entertained by you. If she 
sees other guys as being more confident and more entertaining she most certainly will excuse herself to the bathroom or the bar 
to hook up with them later. That's why its important to work quickly so that you do not take more time than is necessary to 
secure a chick (take her home or spend some quality KINO time with her on the couch/dancefloor somewhere). Getting numbers 
on their own is unreliable." 
The 3 steps of approaching. ASF: 
BEGINNING - preparation ... clothing, props, initiate an entertaining and interactive conversation (that is what an OPENER is 
all about). 
MIDDLE - using entertaining stories and routines, you convey the humour, confidence and the other typical attractive traits, use 
NEGS to make them chase you, test them (stop conversation to see if they reinitiate it) and look for the indicators to see if 
closing is worth doing (like KINO, position and body language, laughter, etc), usually 3 positive indicators.

How to initiate a conversation
Back to the Table of Contents
The following comes in handy, if truly NOTHING comes to mind after having applied the 3s rule. It is of course more 
recommended, that you think this all through before having approached, just try to limit your thinking to… preferably no more 
than 3 seconds:) No, I'm not an evangelist, its just that the more you wait, the bigger chances there are that she'll leave, someone 
else will join her for a conversation, you start sweating and eventually chicken out, circumstances change etc. ASF: 
1.  Ask some kind of OPEN ENDED approach question (it will normally begin with the word 'what'). 
2.  Have at least one other OPEN ENDED follow up question, preferably more than one, to defend you against stalling. 
3.  By the time you've reached this stage. providing your questions were interesting enough, you are "in conversation" 
Before point 1) above, you are a stranger & the woman is wary of you. At point 2) she's still wary, but talking. By the time you've 
hit point 3) - and it doesn't matter if it's one woman or a group - she/they have more or less accepted you and seem to drop their 
barriers a lot. All in a couple of minutes. 
To continue. If the HB is a talker, paraphrase her and ask intelligent questions. Then ask some cheeky questions, maybe neg hit & 
get some of your own stuff in. If she's a listener, you'd better have something ready to talk about [or you're gonna CRASH and 
BURN] - a tale or two about your interesting and humorous exploits (laced with SS of course) that moves gently from being 
innocent into being more and more risqué. Throw in negs if you need."

Talking to her = echoing her
Back to the Table of Contents
Girls want to be understood. In order for her to feel understood, you need to listen to what she says, rephrase it and feed it back 
to her (it helps if you agree with whatever statement she made:). Listen to what she says, remember it and you can make her feel 
connected to you and understood by you even weeks after your conversation by just simply repeating what she told to you during 
your conversation:) So make sure a lot of your communication to her is a subtle echo of what she feeds you. Now this strategy is 
already quite effective on its own but combine it with using trance-words and she's gonna levitate right in front of your eyes:) 
ASF: "You need to do more than just agree with her...going uh uh won't cut it. However you also can't just repeat what she said 
verbatim. You have to take something she's said and paraphrase it and present it as an original thought or opinion."

Trance words explained
Back to the Table of Contents
No, I'm not talking about PVD or Mc'ing to trance music. Using trance words is a good technique to aquire.
When you are eliciting her values or letting her describe her feelings while patterning, listen intently to what she has to say and 
more importantly, what words she uses to express herself. 
The words she puts particular emphasis on or repeats frequently are her so-called trance words. This means that by using the very 
same words she uses you will be able to tap directly into her consciousness and subconscious. After all, those are the words she 
thinks with and is most familiar with. And hearing you use them, she feels you understand her so completely, you are like a soul-
mate, and whatever you say to her is much more likely to be understood and most importantly - liked by her:) 
A rough implementation of using trance words would be to take what she tells you and feed it back to her in a slightly different 
robing using her personal trance words. But when I say rough, I don't mean that its not working - the fact that it just doesn't have 
much style, doesn't mean that it isn't deadly effective:) 
A more sophisticated approach would be to listen to and remember her trance words. And use them a little later:) And maybe in a 
slightly different context:) But the difference between this and the first method is only subtle - here you just have to use a little 
more imagination and have a good memory:) 
An example:
You: "If I were to ask you, what's the most important thing in a relationship, how would you describe it to me?"
Her: "I want a man who makes me feel comfortable with myself" (you remember "feel" and " comfortable")
You: "Wouldn't it be nice if you could spend time with a man who makes you feel like you could let down your guard and just be 
comfortable? Whose voice soothed and at the same time stimulated you? I get the feeling that this could happen to you right now, 
with me."

Eliciting values explained
Back to the Table of Contents
Introduction. The point of eliciting values is to find out what she wants in and from a man and then turn into that man of her 
dreams by providing her with it. But don't be fooled, if she says she wants her man to be tall and financially secure, you're not 
going to the doctor to get implants for your legs or rob a bank. What she gave you were means values, which means that tall in 
itself does nothing for her - what matters to her is how a tall man by her side makes her feel. And this is the key - for each means 
value you need to find out the ends value, which is what she really wants. Let's take the example of a tall man. Asking her "and 
how does a tall man make you feel?" might reveal that it makes her feel secure and protected! Aha! That's what she really wants! 
She wants to feel protected and secure, not a "tall man" per se. In practice, she'll reject a tall man that doesn't make her feel 
protected and secure right away, whereas you, who you might not be tall at all but can make her feel secure and protected, have 
just elicited your way to her pants:) 
Means Values vs Ends Values. Know how she recognises means values and what they mean to her (honest, kind and respectful 
in this example). Jake Thomson, ASF: "You learned what qualities she likes in a man - means values. Go for the ends values. 
Means values aren't worth as much as you think. Find out what emotions she experiences by being with someone who is honest. 
Repeat for kind, repeat for respectful. Secondly, find out how she knows someone is honest, kind, & respectful. She gave you 3 
nominalizations that have a specific meaning to her, but NOBODY else. On the face of it, you've got no fucking clue what the 
hell she's talking about. If you hallucinate that you understand what honest, kind & respectful means to her, you've got a better 
chance of eating a can of beans and farting your way to the moon." 
Ends Values = Desired State. A post by Mr Happy, ASF: "For the benefit of those who are confused about eliciting values, here 
is better terminology: You want to find out a chick's DESIRED STATES and TRANCE WORDS. 
M: So, what is important to you in a relationship?
H: Well I like tall guys. (Means Value)
M: *nod* And what feeling does that allow you to experience when you are with a tall guy?
H: Well it makes me feel safe and protected (Ends Value aka Desired State) 
I think that the term DESIRED STATE is more clear and accurate than Ends Value. You want to discover which states that she 
likes to feel, so that you can create those states in her. In the above example, it doesn't really matter at all if you are tall, as long 
as you can make her feel safe and protected. So run a pattern that creates those feelings in her mind. (Of course this is done by 
naming the state and then describing its process...you guys know that already, right?). Note...a few common states that normally 
are important for every woman are comfort and safety, emotional connection, then horniness. If you only get the first part, you 
are a friend. If you get the second part (connection) then she will probably do the third part herself. 
The important part is NOT what she says she wants (tall men, rich men, etc.). The important part is the FEELING that she 
experiences when she is around (tall men, rich men, etc). As long as you can discover the feelings that are important to her, and 
create them in her mind, she will associate those feelings with YOU." 
An excerpt of Don Diebel's advice on not to talk about yourself but her: "By talking about her, you learn more about her which 
will be valuable to you in planning a strategy. Also, it is a subject she will be comfortable with. By not talking about yourself, 
you let your image speak for itself. And don't forget, the less women know about you, the more women want to know about you. 
Be a man of mystery."

But only as long as you don't know, what she wants in a man. As soon as you have that (you just didn't let her speak about 
herself while letting your thoughts wander, you also listened intently, right?:), become that man. 
Update. (Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...":) "Do not try to create a market for your product just because you think it's 
a great product. Find a product that the market demands and you will be successful. Fill a need and you can't go wrong." 
Update. NYC, ASF: "[Eliciting values so as to really make her think and fetch those answers from deep within her] is one of the 
major differences that will get you noticed. MOST guys go "so did you have both of your parents" and she says "no" and they 
say "look... there's a movie playing... wanna go?". They ask questions that don't tell them ANYTHING about the chick and then 
ask them out... in effect, they are fucking up their FLUFFING because they are NOT distinguishing her from any other chick, 
although they THINK they are. 
Learning about her as a person is much deeper than light questioning, and the thing that turns chicks on the most is when they 
BELIEVE that you are into them because of some UNIQUENESS that they have. Something you see in them ONLY that you 
don't see in other women and which makes them extremely attractive to you. They think that men that are attracted ONLY to 
bodies are dogs, etc. By your deeper questioning, you seperate yourself from the other suitors because you make them THINK. 
You make them DIG for answers. They FEEL differently after baring their soul to you than after telling you where they got their 
hair done and how much it cost". 
Update. NYC, ASF: "I go back to childhood and find out what they missed out on or wanted. I find out what they want now and 
what they desire for their futures. I cover EVERYTHING then I CRAFT the VESSEL I need to get into her. I make MYSELF a 
COMBINATION of all the things that she doesn't know she craves. There is NO RESISTANCE to this. NONE! She can't resist 
because all she knows is that I am talking about some abstract ideas or another woman and it strikes a chord within her... "that's 
exactly how I want to be treated by a man" "that's exactly what I want in a man" "Is this guy for real?" what she doesn't know is 
that she TOLD ME HOW TO SEDUCE HER and I have embedded this knowledge inside my language and STAY ON 
COURSE. I bombard her with good feelings and ALWAYS avoid bad feelings. When I do my work, I may not get laid, but I am 
NEVER FORGOTTEN!" 
Update. Everyone has a need. Find and fill that need, an explanation by Jobet Claudio, Mindlist: 
"In my observation, the mere adoption of the following rules can supercharge your own attitude towards being a great seducer. 
Rule 1. People, all people, to include supercelebrities and ultra-gorgeous women, have desires. That seems like stating the 
obvious, but think about it. Even Bill Gates I bet, wishes he could do something different, that would fulfill him and he's not 
getting it now. He aches for something... craves for something... That's the same with ultra-gorgeous women, or women in 
general. They may have an army of suitors, they may be sleeping on the finest velvet sheets, etc etc. But believe me, all people, 
gorgeous women included, ache for something. They have a heartfelt desire for something. That "something" may vary from 
adventure to feeling freedomm, to feeling respected (for the less secure ones), to feeling pampered, to feeling like a little girl 
again. It can be a large variety of things. But make no mistake about it. Everyone "aches" for something. 
Rule 2. And this is cliche'. Find out what it is. Be sensitive. You can pick this up in the small cues that she leaks out. Be 
intelligent in structuring your questions to be such that you can uncover nice pieces of data. What you're looking for is 
"something" that she always wanted that she's not getting right now, something she "aches" for, but can't have due to some life 
circumstance or something like that. It can be anything. Once you know what it is, you can either you "fill" the void by using 
language patterns or "transform" yourself into the person that fits that criteria/desire/longing. 
Rule 3. Fill that "void" that you've found. Use linguistic patterns to achieve this. If she talks about the need for respect, say 
something like "what if... we were living in a different dimension... or a different planet... and in that planet... everything you see, 
is everything you want to see... and in that place... you see all the people, giving you all the respect you ever wanted... now 
doesn't that feel nice?" 
Rule 4. This is cliche as well, but anchor the fulfillment of the need to (guess who?)... to you! For example "Isn't it nice if you 
could experience all of that... with me, now I think it would be real grand if you could!" 
Keep doing that a couple of times and soon enough you'll be her perfect man.

Example: One woman I was *not* really seducing leaked out that she misses her father (who died long ago). I then took that tack 
and talked about how good it feels to be a little girl sitting on daddy's lap and embracing him, and asking for the small "gifts" like 
a pony or things like that. Gosh...it worked. But it would have even been better to ask her what her father was like, to ask for 
small cues, like how her father talked, what he used to say to her, what did he make her feel and etc etc. Then, using that 
information and your power of acting, subtly "transform" yourself into her daddy. It might seem sneaky and underhanded to use 
her own desires to dangle the carrot she's always wanted but lets frame it this way - we're just finding out what can make a 
person happy and giving it to them." 
Seducer... Romancer... these guys are the guys who know how to please, aim to please and live to please (though this does not 
imply supplication- no woman ever wanted a man she could easily control). These guys are the guys who know how to fill a 
need. Everyone, and I mean everyone, has a hole. Fill it. [Now did I detect some double meaning in that last statement... or am I 
just completely corrupt?]"

Eliciting values - introducing the questions
Back to the Table of Contents
Partial Estonian translation 
In order to accomplish eliciting values properly, you need her to provide you with her core values and in order for her to be able to 
do that, you need to ask the right questions. For example, you could start with: 
"I think its an absolutely fantastic feeling to get to know another human being. And what's really stimulating, is to learn what 
someone else thinks of major issues revolving around us in this world… and discovering what's important for her in life. So if I 
were to ask you, what do you really value and what's important to you in a relationship, what would you answer?" If she replies 
with ends values (feeling loved, understood) - bingo! Be the one to make her feel that (by incorporating that into talk about 
yourself or making up a pattern about that). If she replies with means values (the means of achieving ends values - like a strong, 
brave man... to make her feel what? you need to find out!), do some additional asking: "And what does it feel like to have a 
relationship with such a guy?". 
ASF: "Ask questions that get her to go inside & come back with values and criteria. Questions that touch on her identity as a 
person. For example: 
"You know Debbie, most of the time we talk about surface stuff, like what we did last night at the party, or where we want to go 
next weekend, things like that. It's ok to talk about that stuff, and I enjoy it. I find that I get a lot more out of talking about who we 
are as people on a deep level, what's important to us, what we believe in, how we feel, and why. So I was wondering what's 
important to you in a relationship (or this class, or a friend, or…)?" Then listen to what she tells you… Stick to what emotions 
she's experiencing & why and you'll never run out of things to talk about." 
NYC: "You must know who you MUST BE to fuck her. How exactly do you achieve that? It's very basic really. Instead of talking 
about bullshit with a chick or your porsche or your yacht or your country club membership... ask her about herself." 
It wouldn't however be wise to just blurt out the questions, that might sound rehearsed (an impression you want to avoid like the 
plague, any signs of you having rehearsed and you're toast, unless she really likes you, in which case it really doesn't matter what 
you do:). It would probably feel more natural, if you introduced the questions in the line of a friendly, affectionate and empathic 
conversation. An example by Ross Jeffries: 
"You know, I know in a situation like this, the typical thing is for a person to ask "what do you do?". And, it's not that I'm not 
interested in that, but I find I learn a lot more about a person when I find out what the challenges are in what they do. Because I 
know their are some aspects of what you do that are easy, and others are more difficult. Some are a challenge and others you can 
do in your sleep. With me, in my line of work it's the same thing. So, if were to ask you, what's the one aspect of what you do 
that's a challenge, either because you have to focus in to do it well, or you just have to focus in to get yourself motivated to do it, 
what would that be?" 
Update. When asking the questions, NEVER start asking disconnected questions, that is questions on different topics. NYC, ASF: 
"...you can't get away with that at all. What you have to do is STRING your topics from TANGENTS from the original topic. 
Make it look like a continuous flow so that they NEVER END telling you about the first thing they started talking about. 
you: what do you do?

her: blah blah working with kids...
you: the kids must be rowdy
her: yes they are hard to control blah blah
you: I used to be like that too... when I was a kid...
her: I had the same thing happen to me...
you: how old were you when that happened?
her: I was 13 blah blah
you: did you live with your parents?
her: no, they had divorced when I was 10...
you: damn... that must have been tough on you...
her: I learned to survive on my own...
you: my friend had that happen to her also... she likes to live alone now
her: me too... that's why I don't have a roommate BLAH BLAH BLAH 
You see how "she" NEVER got to change topics? You keep changing topics based on TANGENTS to the original topic and it 
SEEMS like you are still asking her about the first question ALTHOUGH the topic has changed like 6 times:) 
The WRONG way to do it however is this: 
you: what do you do?
her: blah blah working with kids...
you: did you live with both of your parents until college?
her: no, they had divorced when I was 10...
you: do you have any roommates?
her: WHAT'S WITH THE FUCKING 20 QUESTIONS?" 
Update. NYC, ASF: "You have to APPEAR genuinely interested in her life. Ask her fluff questions about her life and move into 
the important questions from there. She will only tell this stuff to someone that she likes, so make the connection first, then get 
interested in her and she will be PLEASED that someone wants to know more than if she is a 38D:)" 
Alternatively, instead of APPEARING interested, you can try BEING interested:) Jake Thomson, ASF: "I have an easier time 
simply being genuinely interested and curious about who she is, what she feels, what she thinks and believes and why than trying 
to appear that way. Also keep I keep my outcome in mind, am I looking for Ms. Right? or Ms. Right-Now? I'm willing to tolerate 
a lot more divergence between my beliefs and her beliefs with Ms. Right-Now, than I am with Ms. Right." 
If she has a different belief system than you, neither do you want to start arguing with her nor to you want to agree with her (while 
you really don't). There's a way to turn the situation to your advantage nevertheless. Jake Thomson, ASF: "If we have fairly 
divergent beliefs, sometimes I'll ask her to try and convince me. I'll tell her something like, "I hold somewhat different beliefs on 
that subject. I'm sure you've got excellent reasons for what you believe though. I'm curious, how did you come to those 
conclusions? What convinced YOU? And, if you were going to convince somebody, Debbie, how would you do it?" Because 
what she'll almost certainly do is give me her strategy for convincing herself. As to just how that information might come in 
handy, I'll leave as an exercise for the reader." 
Update. Here's a simpler alternative to asking the questions - frame it as a game (see "The questions game" for a variation of this). 
Eric, Clifford's Seduction newsletter: 
"I say the first part of a sentence and then the chick finishes it as if it were her sentence. For example "My name is... "...(chick's 
name)". Intersperse this with a few pacing stems like the above and rapport is easily built but here's the good part... Use stems like 
"I have an incredible connection when..", "I feel excited when..", "I am comfortable when..", "I feel good about.." and then note 
the trance words. This is easier/faster than getting the chick to think of an exciting time she had recently and works like a charm. 
When you get STRONG responses, you can use some hypnotic techniques to amplify and anchor them. So that if it were to be "I 
feel absolutely turned on when.." "...I am safe, warm, and comfortable", you might just say "Stop, go inside and think back to 
when you first felt safe, warm, and comfortable..." This is like a quick walk through someone's psyche without the BS getting in 
the way because... IT'S ONLY A GAME!!:)".

Eliciting values - the questions
Back to the Table of Contents
Partial Estonian translation 
Here's a sample list of questions to use to elicit her values and trance words. NYC, ASF: 
G     What she wants? 
G     What she likes? 
G     What she thinks she needs? 
G     What she thinks she deserves? 
G     What she had in the past that she wants to repeat? 
G     What she had in the past that she wants to avoid? 
G     What scares her? 
G     What makes her happy? 
G     What makes her feel sexy? 
Ask the right questions, don't try to push her towards some specific state (like excitement for example), it might mean nothing to 
her. ASF: "Realise that "do you value excitement in your life?" is a useless question compared to "what do you value?" 
Here are some additional questions you can ask, that might be a little less value-eliciting oriented, but helpful nevertheless. They'll 
help you to get to know to her and should also put her in an altered state by making her dig up answers for these from deep within 
her consciousness and subconscious. 
G     "What are the challenges in her line of work / what are the easy parts / what she likes / what she doesn't like about her 
job?" 
G     "What is the most unusual thing you've done when playing "truth or dare"?" Hopefully she comes up with some sexual 
stuff:) 
G     "How do your friends describe you?" Use this both for value-eliciting and as prep info for palm-reading, after which you 
can say "Let me see, whether you actually are like that as well" and transition to palm-reading. See "Palm-reading" and 
"Palm-reading explained" for more details. 
G     "What do you think I am like?" You'll get useful feedback on how you're doing and how she perceives you:) 
G     "Your first childhood memory?" If its positive, anchor it, and even if its just neutral, never mind that, in her mind she sees 
herself as opening up to you when telling you about such stuff:) 
G     "Your most pleasant / sweetest memory from school?" Hopefully has something to do with a guy, anchor it:) If not, be 
more specific. 
G     "Your first day at school?" Same as with "first childhood memory", but don't use it before the "sweetest memory from 
school" - it would make it too easy for her to answer "well, my first day at school was it" and avoid any possible romantic

G     "What role would you like to play in some movie?" 
G     "Achieving what goals in your life have brought you the most joy?" 
G     "How well do you know yourself?" 
If the answer to some question is not to your liking ("what scares you?" "mice"), elaborate on what you meant with your 
questions. And if there's anything you don't understand in her answer completely, specify and ask additional questions. Don't 
THINK you understand, be SURE you understand because that is the only way of: 
1) making her feel completely understood by you
2) and completely understanding her - which is what you need in order to know how to make her feel the way she wants to feel 
with that special man of hers:) 
Update 
Don't forget though, that you have to be able to introduce these questions as a natural component and continuation of your 
conversation with the girl. Simply asking them out of the blue will make it sound like you're interrogating her or that you've 
prepared and rehearsed them beforehand (insincerity!) and once that happens, you're through. 
Update 
NYC, ASF: "You can tell when a chick is affected by kino OR talking/thinking about something. The subjects that she doesn't 
react to and the kino that she doesn't react to... don't bother with them. When you latch onto something that really phases her in 
the direction you want her to go, take her deeper into it by asking her more intricate questions about it that she HAS TO meta-
state into the situation to access. She will have to LIVE in that moment again for a period of time. While she is in there you can 
make it worse for her by introducing worse scenarios than the actual outcome, or better by suggesting better outcomes or results 
from it. 
So don't bother with the sections where they don't feel anything, but when you see them become affected, get into it as far as 
they'll let you. If you have done your connection and rapport, they will be GLAD to tell you that stuff and glad that you are 
listening to them." 
Update 
DC_GUY, ASF: 
Me: Do you like living here in [whatever-the-place-is-called]? 
Her: Ya, I guess. 
Me: **Playfully** What do you like to do for fun? Do you have a lot of guys chasing you? 
Her: No, not really... I'm kind of picky. 
Me: Really? I mean, I don't mean to sound strange or anything... but what qualities do you look for in a guy? 
***This is where you shut up and listen***

Eliciting values - the answers
Back to the Table of Contents
NYC, ASF: "Do all this [asking questions, eliciting values] BEFORE telling her about yourself. Then selectively edit or 
FABRICATE your existence to always fit the things that she told you HERSELF are positive things and AVOID what she told 
you HERSELF are negative things. Some chicks like aggressive men and some like passive men that they can cuddle with and 
EVENTUALLY have sex with. Find out FIRST which one she wants and THEN project that image to her. What happens is that 
she notices that you are displaying many traits that she looks for in a sex-partner and none of the negative traits that she uses to 
weed guys out. She keeps thinking about this and reinforces it in her own mind and decides that you are right for her to fuck. In 
this situation, how you REALLY FEEL is irrelevant. You are tailoring your personality to her tastes in order to BE THAT MAN 
that she wants to fuck and she will see it in you and your job will be much easier than if you explained your true nature to her and 
took the "pot luck" chance that she likes ANY of your real traits. The point of that is you need to separate yourself from other 
guys talking about bullshit. Chicks hear the same thing all the time. If you can demonstrate that you are interesting and unique, 
she will WANT to be in touch with you and WANT you to call her. If you don't convey value to her (making her laugh, making 
her feel sexy, etc.) there is no reason to believe that she will give you her number when you leave." 
Her favourite pastimes and hobbies can also be useful. ASF: "You found out something she likes to do, i.e. jetski. Again this is a 
means value. Find out what emotional state jetskiing generates for her. That way when you spontaneously generate patterns, you 
can tailor them to the specific emotional states SHE wants to experience." 
Don't forget what you're supposed to do with the values you elicited. ASF: "It's one thing to ask a girl questions about herself and 
elicit her values. It's another to act like a tourist in her reality. I used to get involved with girls lives and be like "Wow, that's 
AWESOME!" about everything they did in their lives. Fuck that. When a guy does that, a girl thinks he has no life of his own if 
he's so impressed with hers." Seems like the value-eliciting has not been put to good use. You could of course either show her 
your world as well or just not be that damn impressed with hers, but preferably you should be doing what you're supposed to be 
doing with the values you elicited - you've found out the states that are important to her, now make her FEEL those specific states. 
Update. Besides finding out and making her feel the states shel likes to feel, you also have to be able to represent the traits and 
values she finds important. NYC, ASF: "They always come up with TRAITS, not specific things. What they TELL ME they want 
is easily demonstrated to them through stories, and I don't have to tell them ANYTHING directly. I would never say "I love cats 
myself too...", I would tell them a story IN WHICH I demonstrated that I like cats. I let her derive who I am by telling her a story 
based on what she wants to hear in the first place:)".

The questions game
Back to the Table of Contents
I bet you always have a lot of "interesting" questions you'd like to ask a lady when you first meet her. Like: "What was your first 
kiss like?", "When did you have sex for the first time?", "How did you have your first orgasm?", "What makes you horny?", 
"Have you ever been caught masturbating?" etc, you get the idea (see "Eliciting values - the questions" for a list of some slightly 
more normal questions to ask). But you can't just go ahead and ask them - you'll come off as a complete insensitive jerk if you do. 
And unless you are proficient in the art of directing the flow of the conversation in the direction of your preference (see "Eliciting 
values - introducing the questions"), these issues won't usually come up in an ordinary conversation. Thus you have no way of 
asking them without sounding weird... almost:) Because however is a little but ingenious way of asking them nevertheless - just 
start playing the Questions game with her:) 
Originated by Mystery, provided by Craig, Clifford's Seduction newsletter: 
You: "Let's play the question game." 
Her: "What's the question game?" 
You: "Well, it's like Truth or Dare but without the Dare, because I don't know how weird you are yet! The questions have to be 
good ones, no "where do you work" bullshit, ok? You go first!" 
Her: "I can't think of anything!" 
You: "Ok, how many boyfriends have you had?" 
From there the questions will get deeper and more sexual as the game goes along. Then after you have been playing for a few 
minutes, when it's your turn you can say 
You: "I have a good question for you... Would you like to kiss me?" 
Her: "I don't know" 
You: "Let's find out!" 
*kiss* 
You: "I thought so!" 
Don't go overboard with the sexual questions though. Asking even one of the above questions might do just fine, especially if she 
responds positively, which is your cue that she would also be ready for the final question:)

Reading body language
Back to the Table of Contents
Doesn't matter whether she is interested in you, you'll make her interested eventually anyway:) But look for these signs to show 
you whether you're already making progress:) It's also fun to look for these signs as a by-stander, either in everyday situations or 
for example in a bar - when the guy earnestly believes he is being sooo smooth but the woman he is talking to isn't displaying 
any of the signs presented below, you can't help but have a chuckle about it:) 
Her lips:
H     Big smiles with upper and lower teeth showing with a relaxed face. 
H     Biting of the lips or showing of the tongue, licking her lips or touching of her front teeth. 
H     She wets her lips, some women use only a single-lip lick, wetting the upper or lower lip, while others run the tongue 
around the entire lip area. 
H     She puts her fingernail between her teeth. 
H     She protrudes her lips and thrust her breasts forward. 
Her eyes:
H     She gazes in your eyes with deep interest and her pupils are dilated. 
H     She raises both eyebrows exaggeratedly for a couple of seconds, this is often combined with a smile and some eye 
contact. 
H     She winks at you while talking to you or winks at you from a distance. 
H     While talking to you, she blinks more than usual, fluttering her eyelashes. 
H     Eyebrows raised and then lowered, then a smile indicates interest in you. 
Her hair:
H     She pushes her fingers through her hair. This can be one hand movement or more of a stroking motion. 
H     She twirls her hair around her fingers while she is looking at you. 
H     She is throwing her hair back off her shoulders. 
Her clothing:
H     If she is wearing clothes that show her nipples underneath and you notice they are getting perky and erect. 
H     The hem goes up to expose a little more leg. 
H     She is fixing, patting or smoothing her outfit to make herself look better. 
While she is seated:

H     She moves in time to the music, with her eyes on you. 
H     She starts sitting straight up and her muscles appear to be firm. 
H     She is sitting with her legs open. 
H     She sits with her legs crossed in a manner to reveal her thigh. 
H     Her legs are rubbing against each other. 
H     Her legs are rubbing against the leg of the table. 
H     Her crossed leg is pointed towards you or if that same leg is rocking back and forth towards you. 
Her hands:
H     She exposes the palms of her hand facing you. 
H     While talking to you, she rests an elbow in the palm of one hand, while holding out her other hand, palm up. 
H     She rubs her wrists up and down. 
H     She sits with one hand touching one of her breasts. 
H     She rubs her chin or touches her cheek. This indicates that she's thinking about you and her relating in some way:) 
H     She is fondling keys, sliding hands up and down a glass, playing with toys or other things on the table. 
H     She plays with her jewellery, especially with stroking and pulling motions. 
H     She touches your arm, shoulder, thigh, or hand while talking to you (in case you already haven't started kino yourself, 
dumbass:). 
H     She is pretending to look at her watch as you pass her. 
Her voice
H     She raises or lowers the volume of her voice to match yours. 
H     She speeds up or slows down her speaking to match yours. 
H     She laughs in unison with you. 
H     In a crowd she speaks only to you and focuses all of her undivided attention on you. 
Micellaneous:
G     She mirrors your body language and body positions. 
G     Her skin tone becomes red while being around you. 
G     She blows smoke straight out from between her lips and toward you. 
G     She leans over and speaks into her friend's ear, just like in junior high school. 
G     She is standing with her head cocked slightly at an angle, one foot behind the other, hips slightly thrust forward. 
G     At a party - every once in a while she seems to appear out of nowhere in your vicinity and if you move to another spot, 
soon she appears out of nowhere again, you catch her glancing in your general direction (actually, glancing at YOU 
dummy!:), she bumps into you… accidentally, touches you… accidentally etc:) 
When talking to a girl, these are some of the more important signs to watch for: 
G     Can you keep conversation going with her? 
G     Does she react well to kino? 
G     Does she touch you? 
G     Does she laugh? 
Now I don't have to explain what the answer "yes" to these questions means, do I:)

How to Lay Girls Guide
From "Sweep women off their feet...": "All these signs usually tell you that the girl is captivated by your charms. But before you 
get there, chances are that her body language changes as the discussion progresses. Make sure that you watch her closely and as 
soon as you get a sign that should be an indication that you are on the right track, keep going in that direction. If the opposite 
happens, just change the subject and see what happens." 
Update. The really gorgeous and beautiful girls however very seldom get around to displaying the signs of interest described 
above. They simply don't have to, as they are used to getting some attention already long before that. With such girls you have to 
be on a lookout for the initial and thus much more subtle signs of interest. One example of this would be a gorgeous girl simply 
looking at your face. Obviously people tend to look at what or whom they like to look at. But whereas an average girl first just 
looks at your face and then progresses into the more overt signs of interest described above, looking at your face from time to 
time might be the only sign of interest you'll ever get from the most beautiful of girls. 
So if you think you're not getting any signs of interest from beautiful girls - you are, but you just can't see them well enough yet. 
Update. Don Steele: "Here are signs of interest sent from across the room. Most are applicable to both sexes. The sequence of the 
list approximates the courtship sequence. 
I'M INTERESTED 
Sidelong glance(s)
Looks at you a few times
Holds your gaze briefly
Downcast eyes, then away
Posture changes to alert
Preens, adjusts hair, attire
Turns body toward you
Tilts head
Narrows eyes slightly
Smiles
Matches your posture
Eyes sparkle
Licks her lips
Thrusts breasts
DON'T BOTHER ME 
Never sneaks a peek
Fleeting eye contact
Looks away quickly
Looks away, eyes level
Posture unchanged
Does no preening
Turns body away
Head remains vertical
Eyes remain normal
Neutral, polite face
Posture unchanged
Normal or dull eyes
Keeps mouth closed
Sags to de-emphasize breasts
In Summary. Frequency of eye contact, the more the better. Amount of time she, or he, holds your gaze, the longer the better. 
How she breaks off eye contact, down before away is great! Shine of the eyes, the brighter the better. Direction of body, toward 
you, good, away, bad. Overall posture, erect and alert are good. Tilt of head, vertical is bad, increased tilt is great. Where the 
drink is held, high in front as a barrier, that's bad. Hand activity, clenched, squeezing or pinching is bad, open, caressing or 
stroking is great.

Most of us are slightly afraid as well as somewhat excited in settings where social interaction is expected and required. So, most 
people do not sit or stand in an open posture. But, during courtship, the more open the other person's posture is, the more open 
that person is to you and your advances. And, the more open you are, the more likely the other person is to open up to you. First 
Conversation Signals. Men, pay attention to all the ways she communicates during the first few minutes as you talk with her. 
KEEP TALKING 
Alert, energetic
Pupils dilated
Gradually opens posture
Lowers drink
Touches self gently
Caresses objects
Crosses and uncrosses legs
Flashes of palm
Crossed legs steady
Dangles shoe on toe
Hands never touch face
Touches you any reason
Feet firmly on floor
Loosens anything
Leans forward
Steady hands, feet
MOVE ON 
Tense, restless
Normal or small pupils
Posture remains closed
Keeps drink high
Grips or pinches self
Squeezes, taps objects
Legs remain crossed
Back of hand gestures
Swings crossed legs
Keeps shoe on
Touches face
Never touches you
Feet on edges or toes
Tightens anything
Leans away
Tapping, drumming
In social settings, most of us start out in a closed, defensive posture because we're a bit apprehensive. A closed posture feels safe. 
When the person you are talking with shifts to a more open posture, it signifies trust and comfort. That person is, literally, 
opening up to you and what you have to offer.
It takes courage to open up to the other person. If you go first, she, or he, will usually follow your move from closed to slightly 
more open. Open up in, slow, gradual shifts of posture.

Mirroring
Back to the Table of Contents
A variation of mirroring is discussed in the articles dealing with eliciting values and using trance-words - that is verbal mirroring. 
But a better-known variation of mirroring is physical mirroring. Actually, you've most probably been doing it all your life without 
knowing it but once you know how to harness the power of mirroring consciously - its like young Skywalker recognising and 
harnessing the power of the Force:). 
Notice how people that seem to be engaged in ann interesting conversation - they are excited about what they themselves are 
saying, they are about to say and what the other is saying, in other words, they have rapport - seem to take the same poses, 
whether sitting or standing up. When sitting, either side by side or on opposites sides of the table - one leans forward and then the 
other leans forward as well, one leans backward and then the other leans backward as well, they cross their hands in the same 
manner, tilt their heads similarly, seem to be having similar side-activities (one playing with his keychain, the other with her pen), 
etc etc. Are they directing their actions consciously? No, all their energies and concentration is on the discussion, everything else 
happens subconsciously. But actually, they don't even have to be having a discussion, they may just both be thinking their own 
thoughts… and still you can see mirroring going on - they make the same movements almost the same time without seemingly 
without having any perceivable interaction with the other person. 
What is all this knowledge good for? Well, mirroring can be used as a tool for building rapport. Being similar or having someone 
similar in your vicinity creates a feeling of ease, comfort, being understood, protected (should there appear a threat of any sort, 
there's two of you now:) etc. So you can use the power of mirroring to create these feelings in the one you are mirroring, she'll 
subconsciously link all those feelings to you (after all, you are the one mirroring her:) and rapport is going to develop between 
you without you having lifted a finger (unless she lifted a finger and you had to mirror her:). 
How, whom and from where should I mirror? Whom - that's easy, the girl you want of course:) How - assuming the same posture, 
doing the same movements with your hands, in all respects using your body in a similar fashion to hers. More aspects of mirroring 
are: 
G     following - doing the movements after she did them. Note that although your mind screams "This is stupid! I'm going to 
get caught! She MUST see me doing the same movements! This is ridiculous!", don't' listen to it, fight it, it is the voice of 
the Dark Side!:) Why? Because they NEVER NOTICE it! Instead, they feel more comfortable and relaxed in connection 
with you, and eventually (that's why you even bothered, right?:) - more drawn to you. 
G     pacing - doing the movements the same time with her. Yes. Sounds impossible? Well it isn't. Have you ever noticed how 
you sometimes happened to do the same things at exactly the same time with another person. Maybe yawn and then have a 
laugh about it:)? Because you thought it was accidental? Well it wasn't, you had reached the second stage of mirroring:) 
(Yawning is not a good example though, the last thing you want is the girl yawning with you:). But there's nothing magical 
all supernatural about doing the movements at the same time, because essentially the second phase is a stage of transition 
between the first and the third. In mirroring there's always a leader and a follower. So far she has been leading you 
(because you've been following her) but now you are coming to the stage when YOU will be leading her! And the 
inevitable stage between following and leading is pacing - you are doing movements simultaneously. 
G     leading - if you've done your mirroring right, have followed and paced, then you are ready for a revelation. You can lead! 
Try it. Cough. She coughs. Scratch your elbow. Well maybe she'll scratch her shoulder instead of her elbow, big deal:) In 
addition to being a tool of building rapport, you can lead her into doing some pretty fun stuff. Do a movement with your

hands mimicking the parting of legs (this should be associated with something you are talking about, if it looks strange, 
she'll notice it and you don't want her conscious attention on your movements, keep her mind busy with what you're talking 
about). Watch her legs part:) Have fun:) 
Another more advanced aspect, although controversial as to the effectiveness of it, is mirroring her blinking her eyes and 
breathing. Being able to mirror her breathing and blinking her eyes is supposed to create an even deeper rapport, but first of all - 
trying to see when she breathes might seem like you staring at her breasts (and you would NEVER do that, would you?:); and 
secondly - all the concentration required to detect and match your breathing and blinking with hers will take away much-needed 
attention from what she is saying, how is she responding to your patterns, values, kino etc, so eventually this could do more harm 
than good. 
As to from where to mirror - the most common situation is when you're talking to her. But you can also try mirroring from a 
distance, say in a classroom, meeting, night-club or cafeteria, just make sure she has a chance to subconsciously detect you 
mirroring her, in other words, she must be able to see you (so you can forget about mirroring her while watching her take a 
shower through a peep-hole:). 
Update. A technique of creating instant rapport by "faking" body-language. Tom, ASF: "I just finished another book about body 
language, and they mention several times that when someone is interested in a discussion, they tilt their head slightly. I thought 
that now that I knew when someone was interested, maybe I could do the same to "simulate" my deep interest in what they say. 
And... it works! When someone's like "and you know, my dog just got a new collar and it fits wondefully with the living room 
furniture; the shade of green is just the same as the kid's bedroom carpet and that's great because..." - usually you would be using a 
few words they said (dog, collar, etc) and using the same adjectives (wonderful, great, etc) and ask something making them 
continue. But when you tilt your head slightly and do the same thing, it's obvious the impact is much stronger." 
Update. Maxim (http://maximmag.com): 
“I love it when a guy sort of mirrors my physical behavior, like when I’m sitting across from him and I lean in to say something, I 
like him to lean in. If I’m talking really fast, and he can keep up with me, it makes me feel like we’re in the same place. If I’m 
being a little frenetic and he’s slow and relaxed and laid-back, I feel really far away. 
—Carlie, 30, Salt Lake City”

Where to meet girls
Back to the Table of Contents
(Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...":) 
Shopping Malls. Try to remember the last time you went to a mall. Can you possibly look in a direction and not spot a beautiful 
girl that you would like to seduce? I'd venture a guess and say no. 
The malls are always full of girls. Girls who work at various stores and shops within the mall, but also a lot of girls who go 
shopping or just hang out. Girls love shopping. Though it is harder to seduce a girl if she is surrounded by her friends, it is not 
always the case. 
Walk up and down the halls and look inside stores for beautiful clerks or shoppers. If it is a women's clothing store or something 
feminine, even better. You can easily walk up to a girl (clerk or shopper) and ask her: 
"Excuse me. Would you be so kind to hold this up in front of you for a moment? It's my sister's birthday next week and you are 
about the same size as her and from what I can tell you have the same excellent fashion sense." 
Better yet, after the initial approach you can even ask her if she sees anything else that she really likes in the store that your sister 
might like too because of the similar tastes in fashion. Probe for keywords why she likes certain things over the others etc. 
Once you have sufficient information of not only what she likes but also why she likes it you can start your charm. Expand the 
conversation to likes and dislikes in other areas of her life to get her view on things and so on. If she's a shopper you might want 
to act very quickly to finding ways for you to continue your conversation somewhere else, but if she works there she won't mind 
spending the time with you especially if it's not very busy. 
Libraries. If there is one place that girls almost always outnumber guys, it has to be the library. Whether it's a public library or a 
college/university library, you will always find young girls trying to do research for a project or homework. 
These girls are usually very intelligent and dedicated to their work, but the plain truth is the fact that everybody can use a break 
once in a while. If you provide a bit of a pleasant distraction they'll be more than happy to talk to you. You could be asking them 
for some help to locate a specific section or specialty book. Even if they can't help you out they will at least have to tell you that 
they don't know where you can find your book. But guess what? That is a conversation taking place right there. Ask them about 
their own work, interests, etc. Show interest, and let them talk about it for a while. 
These girls like to show off their knowledge so they'll tell you more than you need to know about the subject. But if you develop 
good rapport at this stage you can easily continue this fascinating conversation elsewhere. Get my drift? You can start asking why 
they're interested in this particular subject, what's the most fascinating thing about it, what are the challenges and so on. Once you 
move to answering this type of questions then you will be able to get an insight as to what type of girl she is, what she holds dear 
and so on. 
Gourmet Coffee Shops. Before work, at lunch and after work these places are packed with girls. Sometimes the more packed the 
place, the better because you may have to share a table with "someone". If it's not very busy you can still ask to sit next to a 
beautiful girl. Just tell her that you don't like to sit alone and if she'd mind you sitting with her till you're done with your drink.

How to Lay Girls Guide
If you're sitting together might as well talk about something. And remember this is a gourmet coffee shop. These girls don't come 
here for the coffee, they come here for the specialty coffee, and they come for the frills and sometimes even the prestige 
associated with a particular specialty coffee shop. 
So what do you talk about? 
Her favorite drink and why she likes it over regular coffee, how does it make her feel and so on. Try and talk in detail about the 
different sensations and aromas. Women love descriptive talk in detail especially if it involves something that can even be 
compared to a sexual sensation. 
The whipped cream, the cherry on top, how the blend of the coffee with the different liqueurs reminds you of a hot and steamy 
Latin love dance stimulating your taste buds beyond comparison etc. I guess while you are at the library you can pick up some 
books on gourmet foods and specialty drinks to learn the language fine critics use to describe them. Believe me, talking like that 
can make a girl melt even though you're only talking about a specialty coffee, because you end up planting all these wonderful 
images in her mind by using metaphors. 
Workplace or School/College. This is a more relaxed atmosphere for seducing women because you are not under time 
constraints. If you can't get her hotter than hot for you today, you can talk to her again tomorrow. You'll have much better 
opportunities to get to know her. In addition, if you work or study closely together for an extended period of time chances are that 
you will become attracted to each other anyway. 
Personals. [A word of warning about personals - they will never get you the experience of actually approaching and getting the 
attention of the woman you want because a meeting arranged through personals simply skips this important phase. So although 
meeting women this way might feel easier initially, ultimately you will never learn the skills that really make the difference -

Is this too low for you? Is it beneath you? Hell no. Whether it's newspaper personals, telephone personals, video personals or 
Internet personals and chat rooms, they offer you excellent opportunities to meet a lot of women to practice your skills. 
With the exception of video personals the drawback is the fact that you don't really know what the person looks like. But that's not 
a problem. It shouldn't be your goal to meet someone to seduce right away. This is nothing but an avenue for you to get practice 
and experience talking to women. But if things click for you why not go for it anyway? If she turns out to be butt ugly just tell her 
that as shallow as this seems, without the physical attraction things aren't going to go anywhere between you two and move on. 
Now when placing these personals you can attract a whole lot of women with some catchy headline and be bothered with a lot of 
replies that get you nowhere wasting your time. Or you can be very specific and discriminating about who you are what you look 
like and what you're looking for. Feel free to omit any characteristics they may find unappealing. This will eliminate a lot of 
women who might otherwise reply but the ones who do reply are more likely to end up somewhere because they already know 
what to expect from you and are willing to accept it. 
Better yet, read a lot of the women's personals and try to model yours after them. 
As an added dirty trick, you can place a personal as a woman seeking a man to get a lot of good ideas from other men who reply 
to it. Most of them will be really bad but once in a while there will be one that will catch your eye and curiosity. When you reply 
to a woman's personal ad try out these other ideas to see if they work. If they work, you learned something new. If they don't 
work, move on. 
An example of a personals ad. ASF: 
"Isn't attraction incredible? Imagine relaxing into strong arms holding you, feeling safe and appreciated and intimate, knowing 
you're exactly where you belong... I'm educated, successful, emotionally mature, and I know what I want. My work keeps me 
busy, but I make time for travel, dining out, music (very diverse tastes), and anything new and interesting. I'm tall, in great shape, 
with green eyes and dark wavy hair (picture available). Looking to meet a woman who's smart, honest, and loves to laugh. Now 
tell me all about you..." 
Update. A few more US-specific places and times to meet women. Speed Seduction newsletter, Ross Jeffries: 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/where2meet.htm (2 of 3) [8/3/2002 9:32:27 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
Restaurants with attached bars: These places are often great Tuesday to Thursday nights, around 6 - 8:30 PM. Especially 
upscale places, they cater to a professional crowd. Some VERY nice looking women looking to unwind after work. Also often 
these places serve as a meeting ground for women having bacheleorette parties. 
Coffee houses: like Starbucks, Coffee Bean, Tea Leaf etc. Great from 8 - 10:30 AM every day of the week. After 9 AM you are 
more likely to get women who work in retail, outside sales like pharmaceutical reps, self-employed, students etc. 
Supermarkets: M - F noon to around 1:30 PM as women on their lunch hours pop into buy things. Monday to Thursday 6 - 8:30 
PM, Saturdays 10 AM to noon, same for Sundays. 
Shopping malls: This is a no brainer. If they have a good food court and are near offices, then noon til 1:30 PM, M - F. Hit the 
food courts and forget most of the rest of the stores. Other good times: Tues - Thurs 6:30 - 8 PM and Sat afternoons. 
Self-improvement seminars: Such seminars are LOADED to the gunwales with good-looking, SUGGESTIBLE women who are 
totally open to the type of themes discussed in any good Speed Seduction pattern. Same with most of the self-help gurus. Christ, 
ya don't even have to sign up. Just find out where they are being held, hang out in the lobby of the hotel and swoop in on the HB's 
during the coffee, pea and dinner breaks. 
Gyms: The women are in awesome shape and usually quite adventurous. 
Yoga Classes: Unbelievable amounts of hard-bodied, wildy well-shaped women. Take a beginners class if you've never done it 
before and you'll met lots of women, who are also VERY suggestible and open to "new ways" of thinking. 
Update. Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): 
Sporting clubs and associations: "These areas are very good for meeting single women. You find out easily which women are 
single and you can talk with them easily because you have a similar interest. What could be easier? There is immediate 
conversation to talk about and its enough to get to know each other enough to work out: "Am I attracted to this person or not?" 
Now the footy club [Australian football?] is maybe not the best place for hunting women but a netball club that has mixed 
competitions definitely is. Gymnasiums are good to. Women at gyms will talk to any guy that talks to them. Everything is on your 
side in these places because the woman knows you are in the same club and therefore will not automatically be rude to you. Also 
it gives them a harmless excuse to talk with you without people thinking any sleaziness is going on. They may be waiting for you 
to say something."

Night-clubs vs other places to meet girls
Back to the Table of Contents
Should you opt for the club scene(harvesting night clubs for girls), keep in mind that your chances are much higher in clubs with 
mainstream music (commercial dance, played by most radio stations), where the girls are much more likely to hang out secretly 
wanting to meet a man who would give them the satisfaction of a lifetime, as opposed to clubs with hard trance / tek house and 
underground garage, where a lot of the girls are there just to get high by listening and dancing to the tunes (with the possibly 
added effect of using drugs), which often makes them pretty much ignore everything else around them - including you. If opting 
for an underground club its always best to make yourself familiar of your surroundings. It's all too easy to step on another mans 
territory without even knowing, To summarise, yes there is a change you can pull at the fridge or bagleys but just make sure that 
the girl is actually on the same planet as you.
Update 
A few words in favour of night-clubs by Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): "This is the place to find single women more so 
than anywhere else in the world. Nightclubs are reputable for being pick up joints and I don't think I'm telling you anything new. 
Most clubs with age groups above 18 are very popular and have women (beer) on tap. There is the traditional young persons clubs 
and then the over 30's and sometimes 40's places. Especially at the older places you do not find women going there with there 
husband or boyfriend because they are there to get laid or to find a long term partner."

If she seems unapproachable
Back to the Table of Contents
By Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): 
"Often the single woman is very lonely. Not many guys ask particular women on dates and when they are asked they will take 
advantage of it even if you are not her automatic knight in shining armour. You have to understand that even though many women 
receive attention constantly, they do not actually get asked out on dates. This can be for many reasons and the initial one to come 
to mind is that all of the guys thought she would say "no". They may think she is too good for them and she may not come accross 
as the approachable type. 
Have you ever met someone and they ended up being a lot nicer than what your impression of them was? People carry around 
themselves an aura of "leave me alone" or "I'll bite your head off" type barrier. You only have to break this shield and you are half-
way there to getting the woman you desire. Within seconds of asking a woman on a date she can actually change her opinion of 
you. This is luckily favouring you. She is suddenly thinking of you as a possible mate whereas before you were just another guy 
to her. The planting of the interest from you into the woman's brain is an extremely important move in catching the women you 
want. She is now thinking about you in this way. Have you ever had a woman show interest in you and then suddenly you like her 
more than you did before? Well now you are adding up the minuses and plusses to getting further involved with this woman. You 
must put yourself into their thoughts to give yourself a chance! 
Many girls want to have dates arranged so your approach is welcomed and sometimes even wished for. Maybe all of her friends 
are in relationships and she doesn't have a lot of choices with whom to go out with. 
Or have you ever thought the woman you are thinking about asking on a date really wants you badly? She only needs to be 
slightly attracted to you and you will get her on a date by asking with confidence and not taking no for an answer. This is even if 
she plays hard to get. She may even mean no to start with and some gentle persuasion will talk her into it." 
More reasons to not perceive her as unapproachable by Johnny Shack: 
"Its romantic for a woman being asked on a date. They love romance! 
Women want a mate and you may be the one they are after. Most women will try different models before they settle down to have 
babies and you should be in the showroom at least offering a test drive. 
All girls dream of their wedding day and the last thing they want is to be left on the shelf. They are searching as hard as you are 
guys! 
Women want someone to kiss and to hold. Someone to have coffee with and to go to the pictures or to see a show with. They feel 
horrible if they don't have anyone. Many women think: "If only a decent guy would come along. Thats all I ask for". Some even 
cry themselves to sleep wishing to meet this guy and to at least have the opportunity to sort through their dates to find one. They 
know that without dating this can't happen. 
Also, there is something very exciting about going out with a stranger that you just met. It's an air of "anything could happen" that 
strongly helps to alter a girls mood and make her susceptible to doing things she normally wouldn't.

Demonstrate value and personality
Back to the Table of Contents
You have nothing, absolutely nothing to expect from a girl to whom you do not demonstrate value and personality. Be it being Mr 
Smooth or making her horny with GM or leading her imagination with patterning or simply being you in a great mood, confident 
and witty which she finds attractive - you have to demonstrate her something about you that she discovers to be of value for her. 
And she will discover it being of value for her for the simple reason of liking the way that value makes her feel. 
So many guys think, that their mere presence and company is of some specific value to the girl - well it is not. If you sport a great 
face and/or big muscles, then your presence can sometimes be a turn-on for a girl - she likes the way the proximity of your face 
and muscles make her feel and thus your presence can be of separate value for her. But even the few times that happens, it will 
wear off fast if it turns out that that is all you have to offer. 
Any time the girl is bored, disinterested, turns you down, walks away, rejects you or ignores you - you have simply not 
demonstrated enough value to her. Demonstrating the right kind of value and personality, the kind that she is especially looking 
for in a partner is not an issue at this point, you'll get to that when Eliciting values. Right now you simply need to get her attention 
by taking an educated guess at what she might be interested in - see Good traits to have and develop. Demonstrating any kind of 
value and personality from that list of traits will do perfectly fine for starters, and is infinitely better than the "Here I am, this is the 
way I look (and I'm sorry I'm not better-looking), now please like me" attitude used by most guys (who are also "trying" to be 
funny and confident etc, but eventually their AFC'ness will inevitably shine through:). Which will leave them scratching their 
heads while the girl walks away and thinking "oh, better luck next time, I'm sure someone somewhere will like me... I hope". 
In fact, you are like a travelling salesman, giving girls only a foretaste of the goods and offering them an opportunity to get the 
real stuff... "if they behave well enough":) See the difference with AFC thinking? Which seems to consider that the girls are the 
"goods" which you might eventually get if you date, pay for dinners/movies and take their disrespect long enough? No, YOU are 
the goods, but you're not selling to everyone - you offer only to a select group of potential customers. But you don't need to push 
it, the stuff is for real and you know it, and if one customer doesn't want it, its her loss, another one will grab you gladly:) 
Just don't forget - nobody will want your goods if they don't even know anything about it. So sample it - by demonstrating value 
and personality.

The importance of a first impression
Back to the Table of Contents
In general, a woman makes a decision about whether or not she would like to sleep with a man very early during a first encounter. 
That is why acting like a desperate and horny or a simply nice and wimpy AFC yields you nothing. Ever. Including later:) And if 
a woman has decided that she is not interested in sleeping with you, no amount of pursuit or persuasion is going to move her. 
Many men have wasted their precious time and energy by ignoring the reality of having fallen into the LJBF zone. 
All in all, there is nothing you can do to change her mind. Unless... you change yourself:) Should you be able to leave your old 
AFC habits behind and become a man, she won't be able to hold on to her old beliefs about you. Now that you're different and can 
make her feel different, present yourself to her anew and watch the fireworks:) 
This however does not revoke the importance of a first impression. Women are used to making up their minds (about you-know-
what:) according to their first impressions so changing their minds about it will be somewhat of a paradigm shift. You can make it 
happen, but with a considerably more effort on your part than if you had left the right impression on her the first time around 
(which she would have returned by leaving the right kind of impressions on you - her claw-marks on your back:). 
In conclusion, if you're an AFC - she will either like you or not, and there's nothing you can do about it. If you're a PUA, your 
options are much more varied - maybe she just didn't like the approach you used, no problem, try another one, or maybe you 
simply weren't at your best, next time you meet, she has a chance to reevaluate her position:)

Pace and lead
Back to the Table of Contents
An example of verbal pacing and demonstrating understanding to increase rapport (see "Mirroring" for an explanation and 
examples of physical pacing). Speed Seduction newsletter, Ross Jeffries: 
"VERBALLY PACE THE ONGOING SITUATION - I cannot emphasize enough the power of this VERY important rule. 
Basically, what it means is to verbally describe and therefore ACKNOWLEDGE the situation and reality that she finds herself in 
with you. 
An example: 
Let's say you're a lucky s.o.b., and, like me, you live right by a jog or bike path. Women are constantly skating, blading, running 
or biking right by you. And let's say further, that, you, like me, are a lazy son of a bitch and have no intention of moving your own 
fat ass via bike, blades, running etc. What do you have to do in order to meet and talk to these women? Well, Buckwheat, what ya 
first and foremost gotta do is... Ya Gotta Get 'Em To Stop! 
With that in mind, I have actually USED the following approach and ACTUALLY gotten it to work! I merely wait for a nice 
looking young lady to come jogging, blading or biking toward my stationary position along the path. I then jump out, hold out a 
hand and in my most authoratative tone yell: STOP! (This is actually pretty funny to watch. I have never had them NOT stop!) 
I then say something like, "If you're that easily stopped... you need a boyfriend who will MOTIVATE you! My name is Ross". 
In the example above, where I've just jumped in her path and yelled "STOP", what do you think this girl is thinking? It's a safe bet 
it is something along the lines of "this guy is fuckin' nuts"! So I better USE that instead of ignoring it. 
I say something along these lines, "Look, I know this is a totally nutty way to meet someone (pacing her ongoing belief)... but I 
knew if I didn't do SOMETHING to stop you, we'd never get a chance to talk (also completely true... a truism with which she 
cannot argue) and maybe see how much WE COULD REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER (embedded suggestion)". 
The principle here is VERY important. And that is... BY DEMONSTRATING UNDERSTANDING, YOU INCREASE 
RAPPORT! 
Now, let me make something critically clear: I did NOT say demonstrate that YOU are "understanding, sensitive" etc. I said 
demonstrate "understanding"... of her ongoing reality and situation. Not in the sense of apologizing or excusing but simply that 
you are alert and AWARE of who she is and what she is experiencing. 
From here, what I will do is say, "Look...I don't have a lot of time here (a bit of a "takeaway" which always makes you more 
appealing). And it's obvious that you are on the move too. But if you'll sit with me for 5 minutes, I'll analyze your handwriting. 
You'll get to learn secrets about yourself your best friends don't know and I'll get to find out if YOU are the kind of person I want 
to know better (here I'm structuring an opportunity and offering her a challenge)."

Simple approaches
Back to the Table of Contents
An example of a simple 2-on-2 approach (ASF): "Hi... my friend isn't from here (introduce friend)... so how do you guys know 
each other?" You can also use this to approach a larger group. "So how does everyone know everyone else?" Yeah, that line is 
great... especially when the truth comes out and the guy that THOUGHT he was here on a date finds out he's only HANGING 
OUT with the girl he wants and she declares herself free for your picking:)" 
An example of a pattern-like approach (ASF): "I'm sure that you, like me, have had some really interesting experiences in 
your life. You know experiences that were incredibly fascinating and absorbing, like maybe when you were a kid and you went 
to a museum and you just got lost in wonder and delight at what you were seeing. If you were to share a memory about one of 
your most interesting experiences, a person you met perhaps, or a place you've been, or something you've learned that still holds 
a deep interest for you, what would it be?" 
Another pattern-like approach. Odious, ASF: 
""Excuse me (to get her to stop) I just wanted to say thank you." 
Her curiosity bells just went DING. She'll almost inevitably ask why, though it is ok if she doesn't. Move into standard mirroring 
and rapport building techniques as you continue... 
"Have you ever had one of those days where, you find yourself feeling sort of aloof... you're not really happy, but not really sad 
either... you just feel like your adrift. Then suddenly you find you bump into somebody with an incredibly warm and beautiful 
smile that just makes you feel wonderful for the rest of the day?" 
She will almost surely smile more at this point, or give some degree of positive response. 
"So, I just had to thank you for brightening up my day... Though, you know it would be a shame if this is the last time I'll see that 
wonderful smile... what's your name?"" 
An example of approaching girls in cafeterias with some aspects of patterning. ASF: 
G     Walk up from a direction where they can see you coming (I like them to feel like I walked up to them confidently, not like 
I'm trying to sneak up on them or trick them).
G     Sit down while you say something with a big smile and like you've known them your whole life. It doesn't much matter 
what you say, but if you say something interesting it makes it easier to continue the conversation (now they have had a 
state change and are wondering if they know you).
G     Make interesting conversation (use patterns if you know them) while mirroring them. Tell them a little bit about yourself 
then SMOOTHLY #close. 
M: "So, How was you day" (sit down)

How to Lay Girls Guide
H: "Good... how was yours" (This is a very typical response if you were smooth with the intro).
M: "My day was awesome so far (try to match her outlook, if she looks completely down try "pretty good").I had a great day at 
work, and then one of my closest friends that I hadn't talked to in a while called me. You know how you can just talk to someone 
and no how long it's been you just _feel_ this great connection with them..."
H: "That's cool, I have a friend like that"
M: "Someone you can really trust, who always makes you feel good to talk to?"
H: "Yeah, I've known her forever"
M: ...
H: ...
M: "I have to go, but I've really enjoyed this conversation, why don't you give me your number and we can talk again" 
"How was your day", pacing and rapport building. Anubis, ASF: "If there's nothing particularly interesting about the 
environment in which you find yourselves, the first sentence or two gives you the perfect opportunity to pace her (this is more 
what I'd be tempted to do at a party or some social gathering). 
----- 
Example 1 
You walk across to her and, genuinely interested, ask: 
"So, how was your day?" 
In a fraction of a second she flickers through the events of the day, smiles, and says "Great!" Her smile is infectious and you find 
yours matching it as you reply. 
"Excellent! So was mine. What did you do?" 
She's had a great day. You've had a great day. She feels a small (at this stage) degree of rapport and should have little problem 
sharing her good mood. This leads her into talking about what she did to have such a great day, a list of sentences in which you 
should find any number of conversational hooks to bite on. 
----- 
Example 2 
You walk across to her and, genuinely interested, ask: 
"So, how was your day?" 
In a fraction of a second she flickers through the events of the day, sighs, and says "Awful." Her sadness is infectious and you 
feel an empathic frown flow across your face as you ask "Oh, what happened?" 
This then thereotically leads her into talking about what happened, and gives you the opportunity to show her that you can bring 
her from a pisspoor mood into a happy one. Hear her out. Whereas to fix up our bad moods we (i.e. men) usually look for 
solutions to the cause, women tend to share their feelings. Once she's unloaded the baggage, you've got rapport. Time to turn her 
mood around and get her happy. Not easy, but attainable. 
-----
Example 3 
You walk down to her and, genuinely interested, ask: "So, how was your day?"
She's in a torpor. "Boring."
Looking for a spark of life to flash across her eyes, you continue. 
"Oh. In which case, how was yesterday?" 
She sighs. "Just as bad." 
Medic! We need some 50mg of adrendaline over here, STAT! 
You figure it's time to have some fun and, placing your hands apart as if you're measuring a fish, say: "So you're pretty sure you 
don't feel *this* excited yet?" 
She looks, pauses. "No." 
You bring your hands closer. "Perhaps you're feeling this excited?"

She can see where you're going. Was that slight muscle-twitch a hint of a smile hastily covered? 
"Not really." 
You hold up in one hand a very small gap between your thumb and forefinger and, smiling but seriously: "Could you possibly be 
at the very least, entertaining the thought of considering the likelihood of being *this* excited." 
If you can bring a smile to a catatonic, they'll love you for it. Same with angry people. Personally, I enjoy the challenge of 
making pissed-off people smile." 
Update
You look exactly like.... A brilliant opener by Clifford, Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: "My all purpose opener. I look at them 
as if I recognize them and then I go up and say "Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt you while you are (whatever she is doing), 
but you look exactly like... you know, it is amazing how much you look like this person... you look just like (as you drag this out 
you develop rapport immediately, it's great)..." 
From here you have to judge her personality. The real ending is "You look exactly like... someone I should get to know better" or 
"...somebody I would like to meet!" But if you sense that she's uptight or has no sense of humour, go serious with something like 
"...you know, the more I look at you the more I realize that you aren't who I thought you were, but I would like to meet you in 
any event. My name is..."." 
Update
The Horoscope. Brother Andy, Clifford's Seduction newsletter: 
"Hey, my horoscope today said that I need to make new friends, and as weird as that sounds, I could actually use some new 
friends. My name is [Myname]" 
"Hi, I'm [Cutegirl]" 
"It's nice to meet you, [Cutegirl]" 
[Smalltalk] 
"Well, I'm in a hurry, but if I could get your number so we can sit down and have some lunch one day, that'd be great." 
"Okay, sure [Myname], here"

The cold approach
Back to the Table of Contents
Him: Hi, my name's Dave, what's yours?
Her: (typically) Griselda.
Him: Right, Griselda, now we're on first name terms, how about a fuck? 
Delivered seriously, you'll get a "yes" and a fuck out of about only every 25th girl you approach this with. Yes, these are actual 
statistics - this was a description of one guy's style who indeed has a success rate of 1 in 25 times, but who (not surprisingly:) also 
gets slapped about a lot:) But modify this to the GM style - forestall any negative responses, be "just kidding", joking and 
humorous instead of being serious, get her to laugh, then continue with the remainder of the GM arsenal - and if you do it right, 
your success rate will skyrocket and you won't have to possess the reflexes of Thresh to avoid all the *SLAPS!* flying your way:) 
Update. David Off, ASF: "A friend of mine has a minimalist GM technique that seems to work. He simply grunts 'SEX' at 
women, that's it! Seems to work about 10% of the time... he rarely leaves a bar or party empty handed."

If you just have to use a pick-up line
Back to the Table of Contents
Like when you used the 3s rule and now have her attention… but haven't said anything yet and cannot think of anything to say. If 
you just have to use a pick-up line, introduce it like this: "Hi, I wanna try a pick-up line on you / my friend gave me this crazy 
collection of pick-up lines, tell me what you think about this one / some of them", then pick one of the following. If she responds 
(doesn't matter whether its good or bad, just as long as she doesn't completely ignore you), say "Well, here's another one, how 
'bout this", then pick another one. At least one of them should get a laugh. Then you can ask what other lines has she heard 
recently and what's the sleaziest she's ever heard or what's the best she's ever heard. But on the whole, pick-up lines are lame 
(don't mention that aloud though, you used them to start a conversation with her, remember?:), so change the subject and move 
onto using a technique of your preference (be it patterns, negging, eliciting values, whatever). So here are some pick-up lines to 
use as a last-ditch resource (or if you're using the GM technique, to integrate with your style): 
G     (Delivered rapid-fire fast!) Hi! Do you have a boyfriend? Would you like a better one? Answer the second question first! 
G     (To a woman in a tight outfit at a party or bar!) Hi! That's a great outfit you're almost wearing! 
G     (To woman with great legs in any situation!) Excuse, but I just wanted to tell you, if God made anything nicer than your 
legs (or smile) he's saving it for himself! 
G     The word of the day is legs. Let's go back to my place and spread the word. 
G     Let's go back to my place, order some pizza and fuck. *SLAP*. Okay, how about chinese? 
G     I like every bone in your body, especially mine. 
G     Nice shoes. Wanna fuck? 
G     I'm not trying to pressure you. I don't want to have sex without mutual consent. Oh and by the way, you have my consent. 
G     Let's go to my place and do the things I'll tell everyone we did anyway. 
G     All those curves, and me with no brakes. 
G     If I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me? 
G     Is it hot in here or is it just you? 
G     Why don't you sit on my lap and we'll talk about the first thing that pops up. 
G     Heybabe, I was hoping you could help me out for a sec (pause)? You see a snake just bit my nads and I need you to suck 
the poison out. 
G     Can you help me? I have to pee and the doctor said I can't lift anything heavy. 
Update 
G     I like your legs so much I'm going to name them. This one is Christmas and this one is New Years. Can I see you in

G     If I were to ask you for sex, would your answer be the same as the answer to this question? 
G     Excuse me, I just noticed you noticing me and I just wanted to give you notice that I noticed you too. 
G     (As you walk by, turn around and say:) Excuse me, did you just touch my ass? No? Damn! 
G     Do you know the difference between a hamburger and a blow job? No! Well in that case, d'ya wanna do lunch? 
G     Excuse me, miss, do you give head to strangers? No. Well, then, allow me to introduce myself. 
G     Fuck me if I am wrong, but haven't we met before? 
G     Is it cold in here, or are you just happy to see me? (For the uninitiated - this references to erect nipples and is a redo of the 
classic Mae West line "Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?":) 
G     That shirt is very becoming on you, and if I was on you, i'd becumming too! 
Update. Remember - most of these can only be used as "examples" of pick-up lines because the lameness, supplication or 
dirtyness aspects of them are sure to backfire in a majority of cases should you make the mistaken judgement of using them 
seriously. In certain situations however, some of them are applicable by themselves as well (for example, as part of GM-style or 
neghits) - but which ones? Well, you be the judge:) 
One redeeming quality of most of these pick-up lines however is that they can be used much more effectively to close, not to 
approach and initiate. Imagine saying "Wanna fuck?" as a first thing to a woman you just met. Now imagine saying "Wanna 
fuck?" to a woman, who you've been talking to for a while already, getting her intrigued, interested, feeling pleasurable, safe, 
happy and horny. See the difference:)? So although the general consent among women and pick-up artists alike is that pick-up 
lines suck - they suck as pick-up lines, but when it comes to closing, you might find yourself using the very same pick-up line you 
snared at when reading these examples:) Have fun:) 
G     Shall we talk or continue flirting from a distance? 
(in case you caught some of her "signs", but once again, you are better off using anything but a pick-up line to start a 
conversation). 
G     What does it feel like to be the most beautiful girl in this room? 
(major supplication, but might work if she is cute and not drop-dead gorgeous, see also "Neghits explained") 
G     You know, you might be asked to leave soon. You're making the other women look really bad. 
(same as above) 
G     You're ugly, but there's something about you that intrigues me. 
(to be used on a real drop-dead gorgeous beauty only, see also "Neghits explained") 
G     What would you do if I kissed you right now? 
(not that good for a pick-up line, but a definate step in the right direction in case you've been chatting for a while;) 
G     Would you like to come to a party in my toolshed? 
G     Why don't you surprise your roommate and not come home tonight? 
G     What do you say we go back to my room and do some math: add you and me, subtract our clothes, divide your legs, and 
multiply. 
G     Ever tried those weird prickly condoms? 
G     I think I could fall madly in bed with you. 
G     Pardon me, but are you a screamer or a moaner? 
G     Excuse me, but would you like an orally stimulated orgasm? 
G     "Excuse me, miss, do you give head to strangers?" 
"No." 
"Well, then, allow me to introduce myself." 
G     Is that your boyfriend? I think you can do better than that! 
G     Oh no, I'm choking! I need mouth to mouth, quick! 
G     Like the look of your crotch. 
G     Are you as good as they say you are? 
G     Baby, I got a backstage pass to your ass! 
G     I wanna put my thingy into your thingy. 
G     Your place or mine? Tell you what? I'll flip a coin. Head at my place, tail at yours. 
G     Who's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?

G     "Hi, stare at the floor for a while would ya" 
"Why?" 
"Because you gonna be staring at the ceiling for a week." 
G     You are so beautiful that I would crawl ten miles on my hands and knees through broken glass just to jerk off in your 
shadow. 
G     You are so beautiful I'd drag my balls through a mile of broken glass, followed by a mile of hot coals just to sniff the tire 
tracks of the laundry truck that takes your panties to the cleaners. 
G     You are so beautiful I'd drag my balls through a mile of barbed wire just to suck the cock that screwed you last. 
G     Hi, do you know any good opening lines? [wow, that was tame!] 
And now, for your enjoyment, some rebuttals women might use on you if you make the mistake of using the above pick-up lines 
the AFC way - trying to win her graces with the supplicative ones while actually making her just plain bored and sick, or trying to 
get her to have sex with you on the spot with the dirty ones while actually earning a slap in the face. See "Dealing with rejection" 
on how to cope with situations like these from the male perspective:)

"Bad" jokes
Back to the Table of Contents
A few "bad" jokes to go with your GM style:) 
Pants in the air. "Hey girls, do you know how you can tell whether you liked us?" "No?" "Well tonight, when you get back to 
your hotel / dorm, and you remove your panties, throw them in the air and if they stick to the ceiling / wall, then that means that 
you liked us!" (Nathan Szilard, ASF: "I couldn't fucking believe it, the girls laughed hysterically!!":) 
The telepathic watch. You can act this one out with her or tell it as a joke as a safer alternative:) "A rather confident man walks 
into a bar and takes a seat next to a very attractive woman. He gives her a quick glance, then casually looks at his watch for a 
moment. The woman notices this and asks, "Is your date running late?" "No", he replies, "I just bought this state-of-the-art watch 
and I was just testing it." The intrigued woman says, "A state-of-the-art watch? What's so special about it?" "It uses alpha waves 
to telepathically talk to me," he explains. "What's it telling you now?" "Well, it says you're not wearing any panties." The woman 
giggles and replies, "Well it must be broken then, because I am wearing panties!" The man starts tapping on the watch face and 
says, "Damn thing must be an hour fast!" 
The spermogram. This one is very usable separately as well, but better not use it before you've made sure the girl is or would be 
comfortable with sexual innuendoes. "A guy goes to a hospital to get a spermogram. The doctor gives him a glass and ask him to 
fill it up. He goes home to try it with his left hand, try it with his right hand and nothing. He asks for his wife to help, she tries 
with her left hand, her right hand, her mouth, and nothing. Then again, he asks for his daughter to help, she tries with her left 
hand, right hand, mouth and nothing. He asked for her neighbour to help, a real HB, she tries all that and nothing. Then, he goes 
back to the hospital and tells the doctor: "Give me another glass. Nobody can open this one!"." 
Rating system explained. This one is quite harsh for a girl and not because of the sex-theme but rather because of the "rating 
girls" theme. Even while laughing at this joke, she's bound to think "I wonder what she rates ME?". Of course this could have her 
imagine all sorts of fun stuff like "I wonder if I'm 8 / if he'd eat me?:)" but more probably than not, rating her, even if only 
hypothetically, is a major turn-off for a girl. So you'd better use quoting if you just have to tell this one ("I can't believe it, my 
friend just told me this stupid joke…":). 
Rating system explained:
7 You'd Fuck Her
8 You'd Eat Her
9 You'd Eat Her After You Fucked Her
10 You'd eat her after your Buddy Fucked Her! 
Hurdles. What's this: Grab your upper lip with one hand, lower lip with the other, and pull upper to left, lower to right, then 
upper to right, lower to left, repeat 5 times, then open mouth a little wider while doing same for one repetition, then 5 more 
repetitions as above.
Answer: view from below of girl doing 100 meter hurdles. 
In a loud club. Not actually a continuation of the GM technique and you won't get her with this one, but it'll probably cheer you 
up a little nevertheless:)

Doctor's appointment. One night, as a couple lay down for bed, the husband gently taps his wife on the shoulder and starts 
rubbing her arm. The wife turns over and says: "I'm sorry honey, I've got a gynaecologist appointment tomorrow and I want to 
stay fresh." The husband, rejected, turns over and tries to sleep. A few minutes later, he rolls back over and taps his wife again. 
This time he whispers in her ear: "Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow too?" 
Voodoo dildo
(Here's a great joke to tell a woman you ALREADY have good rapport with or already know well. Notice how it uses embedded 
commands to get her all hot and horny) 
This guy is leaving town on business for a week and he's starting to get a little worried. You see, his wife is a nymphomaniac, 
and he knows that as soon as he leaves, she'll start to GET VERY HORNY and think to herself, "YOU'VE GOT TO GET 
SOME". So he goes to the adult toy shop to check out what they've got. And he notices there's an ornately carved wood box 
behind the counter. So he asks the salesman what it is, and the salesman says, "Oh...that's the voodoo dildo. Here...let me show 
you." So the salesman opens the box, and there, lying on a bed of red velvet is what looks like an ordinary vibrator. The salesman 
says, "Watch this! Voodo dildo-door!". The voodoo dildo rises from the box and flies across the room and begins banging like 
crazy against the keyhole! Before it can break the door down, the salesman says, "Voodoo dildo-box!" and the dildo soars back 
and gently lands in its box. 
Well, needless to say, the guy HAS to have the voodoo dildo! At first the salesman refuses but after an hour of haggling and 
$1000, the man walks off with the magic dingus. He explains how it works to his wife, and kissing her goodbye, sets off on his 
trip. Now, she resists using it for two days, but finally, she starts to FEEL THE HORNINESS BUILDING INSIDE. She can't 
take it anymore, so she opens the box and says, "Voodoo dildo-my pussy!". The voodoo dildo slams into her and begins pumping 
her in every conceivable position and angle. She can't believe the power and precision; she's getting it with exactly the right 
strokes, exactly the right angles, exactly the right pressure and she starts to HAVE ORGASM AFTER THUNDERING 
ORGASM." 
After two hours, she can't take it any more, but she can't pull the damn thing out! The harder she tries, the more it seems to 
change it's shape and adapt to her, to fill her exactly the way she needs to to drive her to WANT IT MORE AND MORE AND 
MORE WITHOUT STOPPING! She tries calling 911, but they don't believe her! So she decides to drive herself to the hospital. 
As she's headed down the road, she's moaning in pleasure and desire, because the dildo keeps making her HAVE 
UNBELIEVABLE ORGASMS. Because she's swerving all over the road, a motocycle cop pulls her over!! The cop wants to 
know if she's been drinking, and she says, "Officer...I wasn't drinking! It's all because of the voodoo-dildo!" 
And the cop says, "Voodoo dildo, my ass!"

Q. Why is sex like a bridge game? 
A. You don't need a partner if you have a good hand. 
Q. What do a Christmas tree and a priest have in common? 
A. Their balls are just for decoration. 
Laying Off Mr. Smith owned a small business. He had two employees, Sarah and Jack. They were both extremely good 
employees - always willing to work overtime and chip in where needed.
Mr. Smith was looking over his books one day and decided that he wasn't making enough money to warrant two employees and 
he would have to lay one off. But both Sarah and Jack were such good workers he was having trouble finding a fair way to do it. 
He decided that he would watch them work and the first one to take a break would be the one he would lay off.
So, he sat in his office and watched them work. Suddenly, Sarah gets a terrible headache and needs to take an aspirin. She gets 
the aspirin out of her purse and goes to the water cooler to get something to wash it down with. Mr. Smith follows her to the 
water cooler, taps her on the shoulder and says, "Sarah, I'm going to have to lay you or Jack off."
And Sarah says, "Can you jack off? I have a headache!" 
The Gift. A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's birthday, and as they had not been dating very long, 
after careful consideration, he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note: romantic, but not too personal. Accompanied 
by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to Nordstrom and bought a pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of panties 
for herself.
During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties. Without 
checking the contents, the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart with the following note:
"I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for 
your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears short ones that are easier to remove".
"These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks 
and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really good".
"I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a 
chance to see you again".
"When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from 
wearing".
"Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night. All my 
love".
"P.S. The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing." 
Italians. A bus stops and two obviously Italian men get on. They seat themselves, and engage in animated conversation. The 
lady sitting behind them ignores their conversation at first, but her attention is galvanized when she hears one of the men say the 
following:
"Emma come first. Den I come. Two asses, they come together. I come again. Two asses, they come together again. I pee twice. 
Then I come once more."
"You foul-mouthed wop swine," retorted the lady indignantly. "In this country we don't talk about our sex lives in public!"

"Hey, cool down lady," said the man. "I was only tellin' my friend here how to spell Mississippi." 
Update. Newly Weds. There were these newly weds that were both virgins and nervous about the wedding night. Finally when it 
came, the wife took off all of her clothes and went under the covers while her husband took off his clothes one by one. First he 
took off his socks and his toes were messed up. His wife says "What happened to your toes?" He says "I had toelio". She says 
"You mean polio?", but he said, "No, toelio". Then he takes off his pants and the wife sees that his knees are all banged up and 
weird. The wife says "What happened to your knees?" He says "I had kneaseles". And she says "You mean measles?" and he 
says "No, kneaseles". Finally he took off his underwear and she says "Let me guess... small cox?" 
The Bet. A little old lady goes to the Bank of Canada one day carrying a bag of money. She insists that she must speak with the 
President of the bank to open a savings account because it's a lot of money. They finally get her into the president's office and he 
asks her how much she would like to deposit. She says she has $165,000 and then dumps it out of the bag onto his desk. The 
president was surprised and of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asks her. The old lad says, "I make bets". 
The president replies, "Bets? What kind of bets?" and she says, "for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square". 
"Ha!" says the president, "That's a stupid bet, you can never win that kind of bet". The old lady says,"So, would you like to take 
my bet?" "Sure," says the president, "I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!" The little old lady says "OK, but since there is 
a lot of money involved is it OK with you if I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 AM to witness?" "Sure" says the 
president. That night the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, 
turning from side to side, again and again, thouroughly checking them out until he was sure that there is no way his balls are 
square and that he will win the bet. The next morning at 10 AM the little old lady appears with her lawyer at the president's 
office. She introduces the lawyer to the president and repeats the bet, that $25,000 says the president's balls are square. The 
president agrees with the bet again and the old lady asks him to drop his pants so they can see. The president does this. The little 
old lady looks closely at his balls and then asks if she can feel them. "Well, OK" says the president, "$25,000 is a lot of money, 
so I guess you should be absolutely sure". Then he notices that the lawyer is quietly banging his head against the wall and he 
asks the old lady , "What is wrong with your lawyer?" She replies, "Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that by 10 AM today I'd 
have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hands!" 
The Camel. A Captain in the foreign legion was transferred to a desert outpost. On his orientation tour he noticed a very old, 
seedy looking camel tied out back of the enlisted men's barracks. He asked the Sergeant leading the tour, "What's the camel for?" 
The Sergeant replied, "Well sir, it's a long way from anywhere, and the men have natural sexual urges, so when they do, we have 
the camel." The Captain said "Well, if it's good for morale, then I guess it's all right with me." After he had been at the fort for 
about 6 months, the Captain could not stand it anymore, so he told his Sergeant, "BRING IN THE CAMEL!!!" The Sarge 
shrugged his shoulders and led the camel into the Captain's quarters. The Captain got a foot stool and proceeded to have vigorous 
sex with the camel. As he stepped, satisfied, down from the stool and was buttoning his pants he asked the Sergeant, "Is that how 
the enlisted men do it?" The Sergeant replied, "Well sir, they usually just use it to ride into town." 
Superman. One day Superman is really horny and sees Wonder Woman sunbathing on a beach naked! He gets an idea... 
"They've always said I'm faster than a speeding bullet and I've always wondered what she'd be like with all her powers. So he 
zooms down and does her in a flash and is gone before anyone can notice. All of a sudden WonderWoman sits up and says, 
"What the was that!?!". Then the Invisible Man gets off her and replies, "I don't know but it hurt like hell!" 
The Flashing Wife. A guy goes over to his friends house, rings the bell. The wife answers. 
"Hi, is Tony home?" 
"No, Chris, he went to the store." 
"Well, do you mind if I wait?" 
"No, come on in." 
They sit down and the friend says, "You know Sara, you have the most beautifully shaped breasts I've ever seen. I'd give you a 
hundred bucks if I could just see one." 
Sara thinks about this for a second and figures, what the hell, a hundred bucks is a hundred bucks. She opens her robe and shows 
him one. He thanks her and promptly throws a hundred bucks on the table. 
They sit there a while longer and Chris says, " They are just so beautiful! I've got to see them both. I'll give you another hundred 
if I could just see them both together." 
Sara say what the hell, opens her robe and gives Chris a nice long look. Chris thanks her and throws another hundred bucks on

A while later Tony arrives home and his wife says, "You know, your weird friend Chris came over."

The collision approach
Back to the Table of Contents
By Rod Munch, mindlist: 
"Now here's what ya do... you see a good looking girl walking down the street from a distance. Work it out so you accidentally get 
right in front of her and you both have to come to a screeching halt. Then, when she sez, "Excuse me," or whatever, you say, "Oh, 
it's no problem. You would have stopped me in my tracks even if you weren't blocking my way!" 
Here she can either laugh or move on w/o comment. If she moves on, she either has a dull wit or no sense of humor, and in either 
case I don't want anything to do with her. If she laughs, you hit her with Ross's line (and I will admit this is a damn good one), 
"You know, it's good that you laughed, cuz it shows your mine is sharp and you have a good sense of humor, and I wanted to see 
if you had more going for you than just your looks."" 
Then of course you continue with anything else (offer to meet over coffee, #close, run pattern, anything).

The available chair approach
Back to the Table of Contents
Benjamin Strackany, mindlist: "You walk up to one or more women who are sitting at one of these outdoor cafe tables. Be sure 
you walk up to a group where there is a chair at their table that isn't being used. Maybe you should buy something at the cafe first, 
but that's probably not required. 
You then smile and say, "Hello, I was wondering if this chair was being used by anybody / I was wondering... is this chair 
available?" 
They'll say no / yes, the chair's available. They assume you need to borrow it for some table you'll be eating at. 
So after they answer you, give a big smile and plop yourself down in the chair with a relieved sigh. Then maybe say something 
like, "Boy, it sure feel good to sit down for a second. By the way, my name's Ben, how do you do?""

The crappy sketch-artist approach
Back to the Table of Contents
Speed Seduction newsletter, Ross Jeffries: 
Ok. This is a perfect approach to use with women who are in a group, although students have used it on women sitting alone as 
well. It works with or without initial eye contact too! What you do is carry around a pen and a small spiral-note pad. Catch the eye 
of the lady you fancy IF YOU CAN, but if not, don't worry about it. If you DO catch her eye, make a big show of pretending to 
sketch her. Furrow your brow and act as if you are in deep concentration.(It works even if you CAN'T catch her eye, but do make 
the effort!) 
Now, what you are doing here is a PARODY of the old, shopworn, trite, "May I sketch you, beautiful lady gig?". Because what 
you are actually doing on that pad of paper, Buckwheat, is sketching the crappiest, STICK FIGURE drawing of her that would 
embarrass a dyslexic five year old! Draw her friends in very tiny, no bigger than the size of dimes [Warning! This could result in 
her friends becoming obstacles and cock-blockers, see "Group tactics" for more information]. Label it accordingly, such as, 
"Beautiful Woman At Dinner With Friends". Then with a flourish, sign it, date it, and fold it two. 
Walk up to her at the table and say, "Excuse me...but your beauty has inspired me to high art." At this point, you can work it two 
ways. You can simply walk away and return to your seat as she opens and unfolds it. What will happen is she will pause... then 
burst out laughing and show it to her friends. After you've returned to your seat, wave with a flourish and take a bow, like you are 
proud of your work. About 50% of the time they will wave you over to the table and play along. 
Explain that it is an ABSTRACT rendition that emphasizes the underlying ephemeral aspects of the counterpointing metaphorical 
structure as super-imposed on the physical apsects of the rendition of the work. Ham it up good! 
Above all, understand that this approach is a TEST. It is a test to see if these women are open, friendly and have good, fun 
personalities and it is also, primarily a way to GET YOURSELF INTRODUCED TO THE TABLE! 
Now, a good way to get the conversation going once you've been introduced to the table is to ask a simple question: 
"I'm curious about something. Which one of you has the most curious and adventurous mind?" 
They will usually volunteer a girl and ask why. You then say, "Because I just took this really funky self-improvement seminar and 
they were talking about all sorts of cool ways things really work in your mind. Who wants to see something REALLY cool?" 
You are then, my friend, off to the races. You have also pre-qualified TO SELECT THE MOST RESPONSIVE PROSPECT. 
Sometimes the most responsive will be the most physically attractive and sometimes not. But YOU are letting THEM do all the 
work by finding the right prospect FOR YOU! 
The other way is to work this is to wait for her to laugh and THEN say, "I'm glad you laughed because you guys all look like you 
have open and fun personalities, and I wanted to find some way to introduce myself. My name is..." 
Then simply hit them with the question about who has the most open and curious mind. 
Another alternative is to say, "I'm glad you laughed because I noticed you here with your friends and I wanted to get a glimpse of 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/sketch.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:32:48 PM]

the personality inside of the beauty [or "... a glimpse of your personality as well" for a less supplicative approach] before I 
introduced myself. My name is..." Then offer to do her hand-writing by saying, "Well, look if you're open and adventurous 
enough for it I analyze handwriting. You'll learn secrets about yourself your best friends don't know and I'll get to find out if 
you're the kind of person I'd like to get to know better". 
This "Crappy Artist" approach also works wonders for waitresses, hostesses, flight-attendants, etc. etc. etc. It works for girls 
sitting alone or with friends. It's the perfect way to get the attention of women lying face down, asleep in the sun at the beach or 
by the pool. It's fun, easy and really quite effective but it does take some balls and every once in a while, some women won't 
appreciate it. I even once had a woman rip the drawing in half and glare at me [at which point you should be glad that you found 
out so quickly, what a nasty personality she has]."

The dramatic approach
Back to the Table of Contents
The aim of the dramatic approach is to get her attention along with everyone else's that happen to be nearby, and then reveal to 
her, that the only reason you did what you did, was to get her attention. This could even come at the cost of making a fool out of 
yourself, but once she realises you did that on purpose, there's a good chance she'll dismiss it as you being simply "crazy" - which 
by the way is exactly the kind of man many girls like and want:) 
(Examples taken from "Sweep women off their feet and into your bed" by ?): 
Example 1 
I was driving along when I saw this goddess waiting for the bus. I slammed the brakes, put my blinkers on, left the car in the 
middle of the street and quickly ran to her. The whole commotion got her attention but it wasn't complete until she realized that all 
this is for her. I simply went up to her and said: 
"Has anyone ever told you that you are so beautiful that you can stop traffic? Because you just did. I never do anything like this, 
but I saw you from my car and I knew that if I don't do something I may never have the opportunity to find out the name of a girl 
so beautiful." 
"I'm Michelle," she said. From that moment on she was already swept away knowing the length someone would go just to find out 
her name. Needless to say, I parked my car quickly, and went for a coffee with her where I had the opportunity to lay it on thick. 
Example 2 
Steve (changed the name to protect the not so innocent) was stopped at the red light when he saw her from his car. She was 
gorgeous. What an excellent opportunity to meet someone he thought. 
He went around the block, parked his car and went right to that office where he saw the girl. He went inside and tripped on the 
carpet and fell like a ton of bricks right in front of this girl's desk. She didn't know how to react. She didn't know whether she 
should laugh or show concern for this poor guy. When Steve got up laughing she started laughing too. He then said with 
satisfaction in his face 
"I knew you had a smile that could light up the room." 
Then he turned around getting ready to leave, saying goodbye. The girl looked at him with a puzzled look on her face asking him 
"Can I help you with anything? You must've been looking for something when you first came into the office." 
"Not really" he replied, "I saw you from the street and thought you could use a laugh so I orchestrated this whole falling thing to 
see if I can make you smile. And just as I thought, you do have a smile that can light up the entire room. Sorry, I'm so rude I didn't 
even introduce myself. Hi my name is Steve." 
"I'm Carrie."

The cellular approach
Back to the Table of Contents
Vampire2727, ASF: "You're on a bus, sitting next to a HB and there's no good excuse to start talking... Take your mobile/cellular 
phone, pretend to call someone and have a fictitious (short) conversation. Then hang up. Start to comment about the conversation 
with the HB. The beauty of the thing is: you get to CHOOSE the subject of the conversation on the phone... so when you start 
talking to the HB, you're at whatever subject you chose." 
Suggestion by Tom, ASF: "Err... make sure to disable your phone so that it doesn't ring when you pretend you're using it :)" 
Suggestion by Nathan Szilard, ASF: "You look her in the eyes and say to your fictitious friend "Yeah, it's always the same story, 
girls keep ogling at me, yeaaah, there's one in front of me, and you know what the worst is? She's shy. ... Yeah she's shy. She's 
been looking at me for 10 min. And she hasn't even yet started a conversation! Ok; I mean, at least I appreciate the fact that she 
has a LOT of self-control; she has not felt me up so far." If she doesn't laugh HERE, well damn:)" 
Suggestion by Ned Ragdnuos, ASF: "Some phones have a ringer test or a ringer volume control, which you could use to pretend 
the phone is ringing. Then you ask "First you gotta give me your ID number. OK. Let me remind you the rate for this call is 80 
cents a minute." And you look up the number in a book or whatever, and start your stopwatch. Then you launch into a phone-sex 
conversation like as if you're selling phone sex. The great thing about this method is you can have a cheat-sheet listing all the 
patterns right there in front of you."

The familiar approach
Back to the Table of Contents
Act like you already know her 
One of the easiest and most effective ways is to start talking to them, like you've already know them. Just start in the middle, like 
you'd go on from where you left off the last time you two met or just start with anything new, just as if you were talking to an old 
acquaintance of yours:) Skip all opening-lines (99.9% of them suck and girls hate them) and introductions (she's gonna be offering 
her name and phone number soon anyway, you just need to construct the opportunity for her:). It is very important not to convey 
the image that you are hitting on her, at least not while initiating contact. Being friendly (and not drooling over her), being 
confident (and not sweating, trembling and stuttering) and being humorous go a long way in achieving this. 
Fool her into thinking that she knows you 
Kevin Kupal, mindlist: "Look surprised, then look away for a while, then look at her then look surprised again. She may open a 
discussion. If not, open yourself by saying something like : 
"You look strangely familiar. I swear I must have seen you somewhere. (pause). I can't remember yet. Let's switch it around. Do 
you HAVE THAT FEELING that you STRONGLY RECOGNIZE ME. Do you HAVE THAT FEELING NOW that I"M 
UNCANNILLY FAMILIAR.(?)" 
Her (most likely response, if the principle works): "... yeah... I must have seen you from somewhere" 
You: "You want to sit down for a cup of coffee while we figure out why we feel so familiar with each other ?" (presup hehehe)." 
Update. The High 5 modification 
Craig, ASF: "I give girls high fives all the time, usually when they are walking in the opposite direction as me and we cross paths 
in a club. Then, the next time I see them I say, "I remember you!" and then we are instant friends! I will also just go up to a girl 
and put my hand up in high 5 postition, then when they slap it I'll just start talking and go into my routine."

Pez opener
Back to the Table of Contents
A classic opener by Mystery, described by Craig in Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: 
"You walk up to a girl, tilt your head to the side and look serious, stare for a second and wait for her to give you the "What do you 
want" look. Crack a half smile, and pull out the Pez. 
Me: "Pez?" 
(This is fuckin' unreal... you can use it anywhere and it always gets a laugh. And who doesn't love Pez?) 
Her: "hehehe...I love Pez!" 
Me: "Didn't your mom warn you about taking candy from strangers?" 
Her: "Yeah...." 
Me: "And it's bad for your teeth." 
Her: "Yeah, but I like it!" 
Me: "Isn't it funny how what's dangerous can be so exciting? Tell ya what... [transition to proceeding to talk over coffee or a 
pattern or a #close etc]"" 
By the way, I don't have a clue what Pez is, seems to be some sort of candy or sweets. Just carry some around to offer to the ladies 
you'd like to get to know more intimately:)

You look stunning approach
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Ross Jeffries (adapted and updated): 
"One of the best approaches I've ever used for meeting women is just to be incredibly direct, but also VERY low key. This 
combination exerts an almost HYPNOTIC fascination. So, for example, if I spot a woman I find attractive, in a low-key, but direct 
way, I'll walk up to her and say, 
"Excuse me (you're not really excusing yourself for making her feel really-really good in just a moment, you're giving her a 
command to stop whatever she's doing and pay attention to you, you can alternatively use "Forgive me for interrupting you" 
telling her to interrupt her train of thought and focus all her attention on you, seemingly in order for her to be able to determine 
whether or not to forgive you:), I just wanted to tell you.....(pause a second or two for effect...they will begin to wonder "what???.. 
what does he want to tell me?") I think you're absolutely stunning....and I really wanted to meet you. (Pause again)" 
""My name's …...." I then extend my hand and shake theirs! 
What makes this approach work? 
G     You are being DIRECT, with no excuses or apologies. This RADIATES confidence. 
G     It's done LOW KEY! I talk SLOWLY...no rushing....I'm radiating, affinity, warmth and relaxed power instead of need or 
horniness. 
When you do this, it doesn't matter that a moment before she was obsessing on that overdue bill or her yeast infection. You've got 
her attention BIG TIME! 
Now you can put her on a "sense of adventure" test by using a little intrusion. What does this mean? Simply...you need to intrude 
SLIGHTLY...and I do mean S-L-I-G-H-T-L-Y on her personal space; not so much that she pulls back or runs or slaps you, but 
enough to make her wonder and get a bit excited. How do you do this? Well, when you take her hand to shake it... DON'T LET 
GO AFTERWARDS!!! Keep holding on as you continue to talk to her, looking straight in her eyes. Will SOME women pull their 
hands away? YOU BET! Maybe 30 to 40%. But never mind that. The one's that keep holding your hand for a moment longer 
though… have passed your "sense of adventure" test:) You have made them already slightly attracted to you in some 5 to 10 
seconds from first meeting you:)" 
The effectiveness of this approach is however limited with mostly 7s and 8s. The really absolutely stunning women will most 
probably not the too phased by the "you look absolutely stunning" line. Also keep in mind, that this approach is a two-edged 
sword - it is powerful and direct, but it is also an obvious come-on. If she likes this approach, you've propelled yourself in her 
direction a great deal. If however this is not the case and she thinks you're a pathetic supplicator (depends on how you deliver it 
though, try to follow Ross Jeffries' suggestions of being low-key but confident and direct) then you've probably propelled yourself 
much more further away from her - in which case a casual "we've known forever" or a neg approach might have worked better. 
Have no despair though, you'll learn from experience.

Update. Once again, the following is an example of major supplication and might not work on the best looking women (see 
"Neghits explained" for more information on that), but then again, it might, and especially as it is so quick and easy, you better 
use this as opposed to having done nothing at all:) 
The corny line approach. Speed Seduction newsletter, Ross Jeffries: "I was doing some errands in a local mini-mall when I 
spotted an unbelievably hot-bodied woman in tight-fitting work-out outfit. As she was leaving the yogurt place with her double 
combination vanilla/chocolate swirl, I said, "Excuse me, has anyone ever told you you're a shining example of 
physiological/genetic perfection?" 
Her response of course, was to laugh and say "Thank you... no, you are the first!" 
I then USED her laughter response by saying, "Well, I'm glad you laughed. Because although you really are breathtaking, and I 
wanted to get a glimpse at the personality inside of the beauty before I introduced myself. My name is Ross". 
I then invited her to sit down while we enjoyed a brief hand-writing analysis. But notice here, that I mentioned and USED the fact 
that she laughed as a way of establishing that I was looking for MORE than her physical beauty."

Pacing the ongoing reality
Back to the Table of Contents
A good tool to use for instant rapport, especially when approaching (as you need to overcome her possible cautiousness about you 
and do it fast) is pacing the ongoing reality. What this means, is describing both the very recent (for example her having been idle 
and you having approached her), ongoing (you talking to her and her being pleasantly surprised) and near future events (her 
feeling good about getting to know a handsome stranger like you) in a pleasant, humorous and believeable manner. Here's a 
modified example originated by Clifford in Clifford's Seductin newsletter. It starts out with some basic approaching elements 
(pardoning, complimenting her, offering your name), which are sometimes frowned upon by more experienced PUA-s (see 
"Complimenting her", "Neghits" and "Should I offer my name?" for more information on why), but the ensuing pacing of ongoing 
reality creates an overall pleasant atmosphere of honesty, simplicity and sincerity, which is often almost impossible to resist:) The 
modified example pacing by Clifford, Clifford's Seduction newsletter: 
"Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt you [drinking coffee / reading the newspaper / waiting for the commuter / your train of 
thought], but I just wanted to tell you that I find you very attractive and wanted to meet you. My name is Rick, what's yours?" 
[Here comes the pacing] "You know, you never know when something wonderful is about to happen, like you could find yourself 
[in the cafe / in the waiting-hall / sitting on the bench / whereever] just thinking about [eating another donut / what time the 
commuter arrives / whatever she's doing or expecting to happen], and the next thing you know an attractive stranger is talking to 
you, and as you listen to him you may notice that even though [you've never seen him before / you've seen him before at this bus-
stop / you've met him before here in this library], somehow today, because he is talking to you, you may see him in a new and 
different way. Can you imagine that?" 
Now what you did here, is you told her something that she invariably had to agree with - yes, she was where you said she was, 
doing what you told her she was doing, thinking in the lines of what you hinted she was, yes, yes and yes. And all of these things 
were quite simple for you to say - all you had to do was to describe the scenery:) But in her mind it doesn't matter - she finds 
herself agreeing to what you're saying, over and over again. And its not some unimportant who-cares and so-what stuff like "the 
sun is shining... and the buildings are tall... and people are walking by" either, its actually something quite important as it is about 
what _she_ was doing and what _she_ was thinking about. So while she is listening to you and she finds herself agreeing with you 
on some fairly important matters, the agreeance she has in her mind creates a feeling of enthusiasm and being close to you, and in 
effect - instant rapport. 
Having had to agree with so many things, the few things that she probably wouldn't agree with on their own, seem also much 
more acceptable as a consequence. So maybe she wasn't pleasantly surprised when you approached her, or maybe she wouldn't 
describe you as particularly handsome - but now that you've showered her with so many truisms to begin with, the ones that 
wouldn't ring so true by themselves seem much more true amongst all the other truisms. Thus for example you telling her she was 
pleasantly surprised when she thought she wasn't, will have her re-evaluate the nature of her surprise as a consequence of all the 
other truisms that surround it. Don't overload her mind with things that she probably wouldn't agree with though - keep a fine 
balance, push things in your pacing just a bit above the actual and towards the more positive, for if you go overboard, she will 
stop agreeing with you... and bye-bye instant rapport. 
Clifford continues: "Now listen for her response - one thing that may happen here and which has happened to me many times is 
that she may be one of those women who starts talking a lot and you won't be able to get much of what you are thinking of saying 
out. This is a great sign. Usually I just smile knowingly and let them talk their little hearts out. As soon as the topic of sex comes 
up, you know you've got her. Just lay back, be friendly, don't say too much, and she will talk herself right into your bed. You may

need to invite her for a coffee or a drink at the right time (I have found a lot of the talkers will extend an invitation to you 
themselves and you just have to watch for it)." 
Even during the remote possibility, that she doesn't display immediate interest, you still have plenty of options to evoke it - 
eliciting values, conversing on general patterning themes or even outright patterning, displaying the general attractive traits of 
humour and confidence plus anything you came to know she wants in a man via eliciting values etc etc. However, even if you 
need a follow-up technique to continue with, thanks to your initial pacing of the ongoing reality you're well on your way to getting 
her to like you. And from there on to... well, whatever your goal happens to be:)

Paying her a compliment
Back to the Table of Contents
Complimenting a girl is a double-edged sword. It has been known to go great lenghts and it has also been know to stop an 
advance dead in its tracks. Some girls will hang on to a guy who keeps complimenting them no matter what, other girls dismiss a 
guy that pays them a compliment as just another chump. 
More than anything else, whether to compliment her or not depends on how you can pull it off. Being hesitant or bland about your 
compliment to a girl that usually loves and craves for compliments, can make her frown with scorn and turn her back on you. And 
being sincerely passionate and unique about your compliment to a girl that usually dismisses complimenters as chumps, can make 
her fall into your arms with a longing sigh. 
Then again, being able to be passionate, sincere and unique, you most probably have no need to resort to paying compliments to 
win her favour - she is already aching to be with you based on your previous interactions:) 
Should you however choose to compliment her nevertheless, here are a few pointers, which, if nothing else, should at least keep 
you from straying too far from the path of the perfect seduction:) 
The first fule of complimenting - don't compliment the obvious. She knows about the obvious, she has heard compliments about 
it before and if you do it, you'll automatically be associated with all the chumps that got nowhere with her with their compliments 
about the obvious. Plus it gives the impression that you're just fishing for some cheap gratitude on her part without caring to invest 
much anything yourself. 
You can make an exception to this rule if there's something about her, that you really like so much, that you just can't bare not to 
tell her. But in this case don't forget to add a description of why you like what you like about her and how it makes you feel. 
The second rule of complimenting - do compliment the existent but not so obvious. This makes you stand out as it shows that 
you've actually invested some thought and have been more perceptive about her than others. When paying the compliment, don't 
just say you like this and that about her. Describe exactly why you like this and that, describe how this and that about her makes 
you feel - she'll be listening to you and feeling it alongside you. 
The third rule of complimenting - compliments tend to linger in the minds of the ones that receive them. The more reason for 
you to pay only the "right" compliments. For each time she thinks of the compliment and it was "right", she'll think of you in an 
affectionate manner. And if it was cheap-ass - she'll think of you with scorn. So recognize and utilize the lingering aspect of 
compliments and only pay her the "right" compliments ("right" being defined in the first two rules) to have her feel continously 
affectionate towards you:) 
Update. Body compliments are better avoided in the initial stages of your interaction with the girl. Maxim 
(http://maximmag.com): 
“It makes me uncomfortable if a guy comments on my body in any way, as in `You look really good in that skirt.’ That’s way too 
familiar for just meeting someone. It’s too obvious that you’re trying to pick me up. —Karen, 27, St. Paul” 
But do compliment the parts of her body that you like later in the relationship and she'll adore you for it, for now you are someone 
who's opinion actually matters to her and thus you have the power to make her happy. So yes, women crave for body compliments

just as much or even more than personality compliments, just don't make the mistake of paying those compliments early into 
meeting her or you'll come off as a horny pervert trying for a cheap pick-up.

Should I ask for her name?
Back to the Table of Contents
Forget it. It might seem like an innocent and easy way of "getting to know each other" - "My name's …, what's yours?". But as 
everyone and their mom is doing that, it is just plain lame. If she's not interested in you, she'll forget your name in an instant. And 
if she is, believe me, she's gonna ask for it:) And this way it even becomes a little test of "am-I-getting-anywhere-with-this-girl?":) 
If during the conversation she suddenly discovers to her amazement that "goosh, I don't even know this guy's name?!" and asks 
for it… you're well on your way:) 
Asking for her name is propagated by some on the pretence, that this way you'll get to be "formally introduced". And what is that 
supposed to mean? Now that she knows your name, she'll be burning hot for you? Hardly. Rather, you get to be formally 
categorised as a chump, or maybe a "friend" if you're lucky (believe me, you're not if that is what happens:) 
One more argument against asking for names - you ask for her name and then, oh goosh, you forget it! She expects you to know it 
but you don't. And "What's you're name again?" is not even a neg - where's the compliment in that? You could of course go "Well, 
I know you had a very beautiful name… but what was it exactly?" - use this one to neg her if you asked for her name and forgot it. 
But better just forget trying to juggle with names and let her ask yours first. And see, if she remembers:) 
In conclusion - names are fine as long as she initiates the exchange. Until then - remain a man of mystery:)

Buying her a drink
Back to the Table of Contents
I'll make it short: don't buy her a drink. Don't offer to buy her a drink neither agree to her demands ("I'm thirsty..", "Will you buy 
me a drink?" etc). Here's why - if you do, you supplicate. And women have nothing but scorn and disrespect for supplicating 
men. Let me give a few examples to illustrate this. 
Her (thinking "Let's see if I can hook this sucker:)"): "Will you buy me a drink?"
You (thinking "Oh boy am I in luck, this woman must like me, she's asking me to buy her a drink:)"): "Sure!"
Her (thinking "Ha! Another supplicating male to buy me a drink just because I asked him. What a wimp. Do they really all think 
I'm gonna go in bed with them for a bottle of beer? Jeez… I'll take my drink and continue searching for a REAL MAN."): 
"Thanks! You're so sweet! Bye now!:)"
You (confused): "Hey… wait! Um…?" 
So even if she stays for say five or ten minutes and has a nice little chit-chat with you - you started with a crash and burn, you've 
already been crossed out in her book of prospective partners because you SUPPLICATED! 
Offering to buy her a drink is even worse. You are voluntarily becoming a supplicator. The women will either refuse the drink 
(they want nothing to do with a wimp like you), accept the drink and then ignore you (they still want nothing to do with a wimp 
like you, but they wanted the drink) or - the more sensitive women will accept the drink and even stay with you but all the while 
feeling uncomfortable about it ("I accepted the drink, so I guess I should stay for a while, it would be rude to leave. But he must 
be thinking now, that if I accepted the drink and am staying with him, then there's some more in this for him. But there isn't! He's 
a supplicator! I don't want him! I'll have got to try to make my exit the moment the situation presents itself!"). And if she feels 
uncomfortable about being with you, do you think you stand a chance with her? Of course, you can turn the situation around for 
you if you're REALLY GOOD - but why make life harder for yourself? 
So what to actually do if she gives you a "Will you buy me a drink?". If she seems to be actually interested in you - you have 
been having a conversation for a while and she uses the "buy me a drink" to test you ("So does this guy like me enough to buy 
me a drink?") or she is approaching you with the intention getting to know to you and just happens to use the most popular AFC-
line ("Can I buy you a drink?") reversed ("Will you buy me a drink?") to initiate a conversation - then explain to her, that it is not 
your principle to buy drinks to women, but she could buy YOU a drink:) An example: 
Her: "Will you buy me drink?"
You: "No. But you can buy me a drink:)"
Her (thinking "Argh… Gmph… He didn't supplicate! Could this be… a real man!? What's this, I'm getting wet!?"): "Am… 
um… Yes!" 
If however she seems to be cruising, fishing for drinks and doesn't seem to care the least bit about you, telling her "No" would 
mean she'd just move on without listening to you any further and getting her drink from some chump eventually anyway. So you 
need to stop her cold in her tracks:) Here's an example from ASF: 
Her: "Will you buy me a drink?"
You: "Give me a French kiss."

How to Lay Girls Guide
NOTE that the tongue play must be an explicit part of the bargain up front. None of this peck on the lips BULLSHIT, because 
you are still supplicating if you settle for that. Here's the beautiful part: If she says no, now SHE is the person who said "no" in 
the situation, instead of you! You don't have to be the "jerk" for turning her down. If she says yes, tongue-action and kino right 
away. Then get her a drink as a reward:) Note that she will probably demure before caving in, this is your chance to show 
personality and be playful. Go GM and Mr. Smooth on her right away! 
"You aren't uptight are you? Don't you go out to have fun? We're having fun!:)"

Leech off someone else's crash and burn
Back to the Table of Contents
This one is simple. You see a guy hitting an a girl and stalling, doing a crash and burn, getting shot down - in other words failing 
miserably. The guy leaves with his tail between his legs mumbling "Bitches" to himself. You move in. If you overheard them talk, 
you can say: "That must have been the worst pick-up line I've ever heard:)". Or if you didn't: "That must have been one of the 
most pathetic approaches I've ever seen". BOOM! She cracks up laughing - she has found a soul-mate, someone who feels exactly 
the same way, who understands, someone she can share all the ridicule she has for that poor underachieving AFC and all the scorn 
she has for his performance. You are instantly in a heated discussion with her about all the dumb approaches she has encountered 
and pick-up lines she has heard with rapport rising like fever:) She will drop all her shields, because out of all people, you, having 
approached the way you did, CAN NOT POSSIBLY BE TRYING TO DO A PICK-UP on her:) Hehe:) 
A variation of this - you see a guy hitting an a girl and she is obviously uncomfortable about it, maybe even to the point of disgust. 
But the guy is still staying - either the girl is just too sweet to tell him to f_ck off, or the guy is a true obnoxious a-hole. Or both. 
Either way, you move in. "Oh here you are! Christina darling, I've been looking all over for you! We had to be at Tanya's house 
like half an hour ago already, come on! (or whatever BS, you get the idea:)" If the guy looks at you with a big "What the f_uck!?!" 
face, say in a matter of fact voice and not even looking in his direction "'scuse me, this is my girlfriend". Now take the girls hand 
and pull her away. She is dumbfounded to do anything herself but once she realises, what just happened... she realises that you're 
are her saviour! Her hero! She'll do anything anything anything for you (not bad huh:).

You: "If you were to take a real vacation in your ideal spot, what would it be like?" 
Her: (describing her ideal vacation spot) (Play along with her fantasy, offer her some more descriptions in the same line. If she 
asks you the same, answer with "Before I answer that…") 
You: "Let me ask you something else. You know that feeling you have when you get home after a hard day of work and all you 
can think about is stripping off your clothes and sliding into a hot bath or taking a shower? Which do you prefer? A Bath or a 
shower?" 
Her: "Bath" 
You: "You know how sometimes, before you even get in, you imagine the heat just working its way through every part of your 
body and then you actually slide in, and that warmth just takes you and you surrender to it? (have something is store for a shower 
as well:)" 
Her: (something) 
You: "What's your name?" 
Her: "Myname" 
You: "Well, Myname, it's really been fun talking to you. It's too bad that we won't get the chance to do it again without all these 
distractions and interruptions." 
Her: (If she doesn't catch the hint, then before you leave…)

If she says "Why do you ask?"
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Asking all those questions needed to evoke emotions and elicit values can sometimes result in her asking you a "Why do you 
ask?" in return. Be prepared to answer her honestly. Not that you are trying to seduce her using patterns and NLP etc, dumbass:)! 
Because what you are "really" doing, is trying to get to know to her better or rather, give her a chance to show you whether she is 
the kind of person you should get to know better. And the questions are there only to help and guide her along the way. En 
example of a conversation preceding that nevertheless ominous question (ASF): 
You: …remember the things you wanted to say to that person, and the daydreams and thoughts that kept coming in and out of 
your head about the two of you? Privately, deep inside you - do you remember how you felt?
Her: Why do you ask?
You: Well… as we are sitting here talking… over coffee… I thought it would be nice … to get to know you… as a person… I 
remember one girl (doesn't matter if you do or not:)… I was in college… it was like there was an almost magical bond 
connecting us… we would even finish each others sentences. I wonder did you ever… feel that way… With me… it is so 
wonderful… to have that sort of connection… don't you think?
Her: Yeah! (or whatever) 
And if you get busted while doing an If she is working: 
You: Well, you're working now and I could see you seemed a little tired, so I just wanted to take your mind off your job for a 
moment and have you imagine something relaxing and soothing right here:)"

Dealing with rejection
Back to the Table of Contents
Ideally, that should never happen. Whatever you did to get rejected (a serious dumb-ass pick-up line, asking for a dance out of the 
blue, offering to buy a girl a drink, trying a close when all her signs were screaming "I'm not interested!" etc), you should 
seriously reconsider you approaches. You are there to make the woman feel good, better than she's ever felt before in her life. 
Remember, the attitude to have when is "Hmm, let's find out how much incredible and ticklish fun this woman can stand:)". If 
however you come to a point of being rejected, you have twice failed - for some reason, neither did you make her feel good nor 
did you notice this fact, which in itself constitutes a second failure. 
Nevertheless, getting rejected happens to the best of'em:) In many cases, they get rejected because they don't really care too much, 
they see the signs of the girl not being interested, but they push on nevertheless, call that lazyness if you wish:) They know they 
can get any girl anyway, even this one, if they tried a little more / a little less / a different approach etc. But they just don't care, 
maybe she'll turn around eventually anyway, and if not, who cares. From time to time however, rejection gets even them by 
surprise:) This is how some of them deal with it. 
ASF: 
Say "It's been a pleasure meeting you:)". Say it like you really really mean it - in a friendly, respectful yet empathic manner. This 
way: 
G     you'll make her see that her behaviour didn't get to you one bit, you don't NEED her company, you just offered her a 
chance to be in your company 
G     you'll set yourself apart from all the losers who leave mumbling "bitches, they're all the same…" after having striked out 
G     you'll remain cool, confident, a gentleman in good humour. And she'll feel crappy after realising SHE just lost YOU!:) 
G     
Or if she has simply ignored you, add "...didn't realise you were deaf:)" 
Ross Jeffries: "I never attach excess meaning to winning or losing with women. What I basically I mean is to realise that if a 
woman accepts you, it doesn't mean that the next one will, so stay on your toes, and don't get lazy or sloppy. And if she rejects 
you, it just means that the approach you tried, at this particular time, with this particular woman, hasn't worked... yet. It might 
work at another time with her, or you may just need another approach. Even if it doesn't, as I once told a friend of mine who only 
thought he saw me get rejected... I never get rejected. I only discover if a woman has good taste!!" 
The good thing about using patterns if they're new to you, from the article in Playboy: "Parroting someone else's words, it didn't 
feel like my ego was on the line the way it normally is. Maybe that's the key. If I don't get over with her, it won't be a personal 
rejection of me. She just didn't go for the material. In the language of Jeffries, I'm on a fishing trip, and I want to see if I can land 
something quickly. I'm not going to get hung up on any one fish." 
More about dealing with rejection from the same article: "Truth is, most successful seducers I've known don't hit for a high 
average. James Toback, the writer and director of The Pickup Artist, whom I met in Los Angeles in 1980, was as compulsive and 
tireless in his pursuit of women as anyone I've ever seen, and a lot said no. But Toback told me he never took rejections

personally: "If someone didn't respond to me, the only effect was to make me think I was wrong about her, that I had made a 
mistake. As Jeffries says, "The difference between losers and winners is that losers don't fail enough." And he's right. You have to 
step up to the plate. If it's not your natural inclination, then having a strategy is helpful and using suggestive language is good. 
Even if the NLP stuff is a gimmick, a lot of late-night hooey, you'd be better off out there using it than you would be at home in 
front of the television, watching the infomercial." 
Ross Jeffries's attitude: "The worst that can happen, is that you find out some girl doesn't want to play with you". Remember - you 
were about to give her a fantastic gift (be it through patterns or an orgasm of a lifetime:). If she turns you down - poor girl, she 
doesn't know what she just lost:) 
Update. Mr Happy, ASF: "Rejection is a good thing, not a bad thing. The more I get rejected, the more I will get laid. I learn 
something every time. If a woman rejects me it just shows how stupid she is. My gain, her loss." 
Update. The reasons for a girl to reject you according to Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au). Keep in mind though, that Mr 
Shack seems to prefer the numbers game without wanting to do much individual groundwork of making the girls like him 
beforehand. He just presents himself as best he can, makes his offer as sincere and compelling as he can, and if rejected, turns to 
these reasons in his mind: 
"There are only three reasons that will cause a rejection. Believe in them and you will be unbeatable! 
1. She has a boyfriend. 
2. She already wants a friend of your's. 
3. She doesn't have the confidence to say yes. You need to work out whether you want to chase this woman or not. Many women 
really do not feel they are good enough to be asked on a date and therefore automatically say no. She may also have been burn't by 
some guy recently or in the past and this attributes to her lack of confidence. The problem the woman faces is that the longer she 
goes on with this and doesn't face her fears then the more like vinegar she becomes. Also many women for various reasons have 
this idea that by not going out with anyone it makes them more desirable. I think it just grows cobwebbs! 
So guys you really don't know what is going on in their minds. If they say "No" then the logical way is to remember these three 
points. It stops you losing confidence. Remember that your state of mind is determined by the information you feed it with."

"I like…" game as an opener
Back to the Table of Contents
You can use this as either a continuation of a conversation or as an opener. It has the two of you say what you like in turn with 
you directing the "conversation" from things and known concepts (movies, music, food) to situations which create different 
feelings and states (standing in a warm summer rain, experiencing the thrills in an amusement park) to actual descriptions of states 
and feelings (feeling the excitement yet safety of a joy-ride:). 
For example, seeing a girl in a record store in the dance music department, idly looking at records, you can start with "I like 
Prodigy". She'll look at you in confusion, as if trying to ask "…what?" or "…were you talking to me?". Never mind that, continue. 
"I like Prodigy, but I also like The Orb. Your turn:)". By now she has understood the point and will answer something like "Ok, 
well, I like The Chemical Brothers". Now you continue with another band, or switch to food or movies. If you say "I like The 
Matrix" after she said she liked the Chemical Brothers, this is obviously going to sound a little strange, so make it known to her 
by using a humorous tone that you know very well the switch was a little weird, but hey, you're just having fun and you're only 
inviting her to join:) She in turn might switch to food, follow her:) 
But remember - you want to end up with describing feelings and states. With the "I like" game that is, not with the girl in general:) 
The "I like" game is not a means to an end, what you really want to end up with is getting her excited about you, getting her phone 
number, having a cup of coffee, doing a *close, showing her the heaven of complete sexual satisfaction - just take your pick:)

Use a gimmick to get going
Back to the Table of Contents
Ross Jeffries: "Are you into metaphysics? Do you believe in astrology? Astral projection? ESP? Tarot cards? What's that you say? 
You think it's all a bunch of crap? Well, so do I. But guess what? Women eat this stuff up like candy, so I PRETEND to be 
interested in all of it!!! Of course, my favourite gimmick of gimmicks is analysing a chick's handwriting. Do I have any training in 
this field? Have I even read a single book on the subject? OF COURSE NOT!!! But of course, just by coincidence, we carry the 
good old Grapho-Deck (you can find it at www.myhandwriting.com), the world's best gimmick for picking up women. 
All you need to do is walk into any bar or party with it, and corral the first girl you see. Just walk up and say, "Excuse me, I know 
this might sound a little odd, but do you handwrite or do you print?". After she stares at you like a bug for a second, she'll say, 
"Both. Why?". You say, "Well, I got this neat little deck of cards from a friend, and they're supposed to let you analyse a person's 
writing. I've tried it a few times and it really worked, and you looked like a fun person to break the ice with. Want to give it a 
go?". Almost always you'll hear yes, and the neat thing is other girls will be watching and then they'll come up to you and ask if 
you'll, "Do me! Do me!". I'm serious, it's that easy." 
Other gimmicks may include tarot cards, magic tricks and palmistry, the latter of which shall be examined a bit in this guide.

Palm-reading - why should you use it?
Back to the Table of Contents
Many aspects of predicting the future and fortune-telling are very pattern-like - they rely on creating states, leading the 
imagination etc. Learn what the various lines in people's palms are supposed to mean and you'll never run out of mesmerising 
things to say to her:) Besides, doing a palm-reading routine to a girl somewhere in public has an added bonus of a possibility of 
also other girls in the vicinity getting in line to extend their soft hands for you to touch and "examine":) 
Palm-reading (aka palmistry) can also combine patterns and kino into one truly powerful strategy. ASF: "Run the palm reader 
routine (you don't need to know fuck all about it). Get hold, comment on soft skin/read palm (saying stuff like you can see she's a 
very highly sexed, physically responsive woman - blah, blah, and really laying it on thick - with embedded commands etc. if you 
like). Don't let go of her hand while you're doing this, keep looking deep into her eyes then start kissing the hand & telling her 
some shit about 'people may know each others' mind, but they don't really know each other until their bodies get to know each 
other." So ok, maybe this example from ASF moved a bit too fast, but you get the general idea:) Just watch her reactions and 
respond accordingly. If all signs indicate that you could get away with an "until their bodies get to know each other"-line, then use 
it:) 
Here's an example of transitioning to palm-reading taken from "Eliciting values - the questions": 
""How do your friends describe you?" Use this both for value-eliciting and as prep info for palm-reading, after which you can say 
"Let me see whether you actually are like that as well" and transition to palm-reading."" 
It is however good to know a few things about palmistry beforehand, for it will be far easier to "predict her future" and "look into 
her past" this way:) Plus your being able to show her how you draw your conclusions adds "credibility" to what you're saying:) 
The next few articles will explain the main lines in the hand and how to read them.

Reading the lines in general
The major lines of the hand
Back to the Table of Contents
The three major lines in the hand
by Peter and Kathleen Keogh 
When you look into your hands, you will see the three 
major lines of heart, head, and life (see picture). 
The heart line shows how we feel, the head line how we 
think and the life line how much physical vitality we have 
to sustain the body. The motivation to live is not shown by 
the life line alone. One's inspiration for life could be arising 
out of a strong emotional need to connect with someone, 
reflected by an intense heart line. The desire to live could 
be motivated by an urge for intellectual pursuits. This will 
be reflected by a strong head line more predominantly 
developed than either the line of life or heart. 
However for an individual to feel more at peace, it is best 
when the three major lines are equal in length and strength. 
This reflects that a degree of harmony has been achieved as 
no one line is imbalancing the other two. If the heart line is 
predominant, then the sentiments will play an important 
role in the person's life. However, if the head line is not 
strong enough to keep the individual centered, the emotions 
may confuse, rather than inspire, the individual to express 
creatively. If the head line is strong but the life line is weak, 
there may not be enough energy to consistently endure and 
persist in accomplishing one's goals. 
Fortunately from the hand prints an analyst can recommend 
to an individual how to balance the energies of the major 
lines. If the head line is dominant then the person will need 
to concentrate on developing sweetness of heart. If the life line is dominant and the head and heart lines are weak, the person 
must find a creative outlet where they can direct their energy. A comparative analysis of the 3 major lines in both the active and 
inactive hands, will help the individual understand in what areas of life progress is being realized and in what other areas greater 
efforts have to be made. 
Reading the lines in general
by Angela M. Mattey 
Whenever you look at the lines in the palm the quality of the line tells you very much about the person. Check to see if the lines 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/linesgeneral.htm (1 of 3) [8/3/2002 9:33:20 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
are clear, deep and unbroken which means the line has good quality. If the lines are criss-crossed, chained, broken, has islands or 
is faintly traced it is considered to have poor quality. A poor quality line tells you that the person lacks good flow of well-being 
in the area that is weakened. It can represent a period of time in life when the owner is indecisive, unhappy, stressed, feeling 
blocked, or unable to feel secure about embracing life. Many hands have clear, unbroken lines even though the owner has had 
what an observer would evaluate to be a very difficult life. This means that the owner is able to survive and cope with life taking 
what life gives them in stride even though it may be significant challenges. There are other hands where the lines are all criss-
crossed and the owner has not had that difficult a life by another's standards, but they see their life as stressful and 
overwhelming. 
The Life Line simply symbolizes the quality of a person's life force energy. The length of this line does not tell you how long a 
person will live (tell her that, if it appears a little short - tony). If the line is deeply etched and well formed, meaning not broken, 
chained or crossed, then the person is enthusiastic about life and puts effort into their actions and relationships. So the deeply 
etched life line tells about a good quality and supply of life force energy. If the life line is lightly traced in the palm the person 
tends to be more mentally oriented and observes life as a bystander with less enthusiastic involvement than the deeply etched life-
lined person would exert. So the life force energy of a lightly traced or chained, or broken life line is more delicate. If the life 
line's pathway travels outward into the center of the palm, its owner will be more bold about life and want to explore the world. 
When the life line curves more closely and hugs the thumb the owner will be more likely to stay close to home and not be very 
adventurous about new things and changes in life. 
The Head Line tells about how a person's intelligence is applied, how a person thinks and to a minor degree the well-being of 
the physical brain. The deeper and more clear this line the more potent the thinking processes of its owner. A thin delicate, 
islanded, chained or frayed head line tells you that the person is nervous, anxious, sensitive and indecisive, being too easily 
effected by arguments and the pressures of another's idea or will power. If the head line is short, the person is more instinctive 
and action motivated. If the head line is longer, the person is mentally oriented, wants to learn about many things, and has good 
mental focus. If the head line is more straight, the person is very logical, reasoning and wants the facts. If the line is sloping 
downward, the person is imaginative, creative and more sensitive. When there are deep dots or dents present on this line or 
islands sometimes this tells of headaches and possible physical problems with the brain itself. Other times such indications tell of 
mental frustrations and of "second guessing" one's abilities to decide properly. 
The Heart Line tells about the owner's emotions and how they are expressed. The heart line can be looked at for health 
indications also. The heart line has a different starting point than the other palmar lines which start at the thumb side of the palm. 
The longer the heart line the more the emotion is present in the personality of the owner. If the heart line is straight the owner's 
emotions are ruled by the mind. They think before they speak. The curved heart line, like the one shown in the above image, tells 
of a person who is sentimental, intuitive and openly expresses their feelings. If the heart line is clear and deep the person is 
comfortable with their emotions. If the line is frayed, broken, chained or delicate the person is emotionally stressed and often 
moody. An island on this line at about the space under the ring finger area tells of eyesight problems. 
The Fate Line is not always present in a palm. When it is present it helps the palmist time events in the client's life. The fate line 
tells all about a person's career pathway changes, independence, personal will power, and their ability to adapt to life's 
circumstances. If a hand does not have a fate line it is not bad like so many palmistry books have stated. It can mean the owner's 
life is dictated by the circumstances of their environment or by an overly possessive parent. However it can mean the owner is 
open minded, free wheeling and spontaneous about life and their pathway. When this line is present in it's full flow, like in the 
image above, the owner has a very balanced inner strength and guidance about life from within. If this line is broken it means a 
major life change, such as a physical move to another location, a job change, a relationship change or a complete career change, 
in life at the time of it's break. This is also true of a break in the life line. 
The Sun Line has been considered the sign of great luck and success in the hand by many palmists. This line indicates talent 
about which you will have to look at the rest of the hand to determine its exactitude. It basically says that its owner has a special 
ability to make friends, money and earn a good reputation. A full line of Sun (unlike the one in the picture) starts at the base of 
the palm and travels up to and under the ring finger. This is a fortunate sign of creative successes or the self-confidence to make 
the most of inherited talents to gain possible fame in life. The line of Sun as it is shown in the picture is how it most commonly 
appears in a palm. Here it is short and located in the upper part of the palm. This indicates success comes later in life and that the 
person might be a late bloomer.

Reading the line of Fate
The line of fate
Back to the Table of Contents
by Angela M. Mattey 
Line of Saturn = line of Fate 
(A.) Marks the normal flow of this line and shows a full line of Saturn. This is 
universally seen as a good sign. It is representative of a good strong career in life 
and good strength of ingenuity to make things happen along the way. When 
there are breaks in this line, it shows when there are career changes and possible 
geographic changes. I always check out the life line to see if it shows any marks 
of change at about the same age. When considering age on this line it is said that 
birth is at the base of the palm and life flows on up the palm to end under the 
finger of Saturn. Teachers say that when considering age, it is best to think of 
where this line crosses over the head line to be about the age of 35 years. (C.) 
Shows a much shorter line of Saturn rising from the base of the palm and ending 
about at the head line. This demonstrates that a person's family may have given 
them support to be strongly focused in their early life, but as they age and go 
past the head line (35 yrs.. old) they seem to need the support of others to 
succeed or sometimes need help just to remain focused in order to truly follow 
through on their goals in life. However, I have seen the line of Saturn end at the 
headline as in C. in order to show that the person has been influenced by their family in a strong way, but as they get to about 35 
yrs. of age they strike out on their own to do well. (B.) Shows a line of Saturn traveling from over towards the lunar or little finger 
side of the hand - starting on the mount of the moon - vertically traveling towards its ending under the first finger - the finger of 
Jupiter. This shows that with the help of others this person will achieve success and possibly fame in this lifetime. This line 
ending under Jupiter is seen in palms of, politicians, rock stars and famous athletes."

Reading her love-life
Back to the Table of Contents
by Angela M. Mattey 
When looking at hands as a whole it is interesting to note 
that most of the time it proves true that a person, whose 
backs of the hands appear veined and creased or rippled, 
delicately showing the bone structure, is very sensitive to 
and caring about the feelings of others. They tend to be 
romantic and sensitive to physical touch. When the back of 
the hand is smooth, fleshy or dimpled, the owner is warm 
hearted but may only enjoy sex just for fun. They will be 
concerned more with his or her own needs than those of a 
partner. 
The raised and full mount of the Moon will tell you that the 
person is creative in their love life actions which makes 
them an interesting and intriguing partner and lover. The 
raised mount of Pluto allows for them to rebound from 
difficulties in life so they are resilient as partners which 
tends to create longevity in the relationship that they 
embrace. 
If the heart line is not present in the hand - (By this I mean 
that there is only one line traveling horizontally across the 
palm, called the line of Simian.) - this traditionally raises 
concerns about the emotional nature of its owner. It isn't that 
they have don't have feelings, it is just that they aren't comfortably balanced about the expression of their feelings. The line of 
Simian is a blend of the head and heart lines. There are periods of time when the line of Simian person may be very overly 
emotional and then at other times be almost devoid of any emotion or sympathy. So the owner of such a line usually tends to be 
more mental in their approach to love. This makes them think through their emotions giving them the sense that they are in 
control with their feelings about their "significant other". They will also be naturally oriented towards being more concerned about 
the practical matters of their relationship, such as money, position, or the career of the partner or themselves and how these 
matters will help the relationship they enter to be fulfilled. The line of Simian is often seen in the palm of a person who is gifted 
mentally even to the point of genius. They are very often materially successful individuals. 
A clean heart line that has no breaks, islands, x's, cross bars, etc is a good sign demonstrating an emotionally balanced person. 
Where the heart line shows a break in its flow - this indicates a time when the person may suffer an emotional crisis- such as a 
breakup with their lover or the ending of an affair, any break is a sign of an emotional sorrow or shock. Timing on the heart line is 
like this - birth is at the start of the line under the little finger. The age of 20-25 is at about the area under the space between the 
little and ring fingers. This gives you the timing gauge for the rest of the line. Marks of puffy redness on the heart line shows the 
person is open to periods of passionate emotional energy which can be overwhelming to others. These marks indicate the owner 
can be easily blinded by passion. The depth into the palm at which the heart line is located can indicate the depth of emotion the

person is capable of expressing and feeling. The deeper into the palm it is placed the more likely the owner is to be very aware of 
emotional feelings and their outward expression. (See (D) for a deeply placed heart line and (E) for the space of a shallow 
placement of the heart line in Figure # 4.)

Reading the line of Heart
The major lines of the hand
Back to the Table of Contents
by Rita Robinson 
"The Line of Heart is the uppermost deep groove in the top 
portion of palm running beneath the fingers. It tells the way 
an individual relates to others through friendships and loves, 
and why. It reveals the emotional and spirtual attitude of 
People, and tells how they feel toward themselves, because 
of their outward attitudes. The line at its best should be clear 
and deep, but not more outstanding than the line just below 
it--the Line of Head. When both of these lines are about the 
same in depth and color, it shows a balance between the 
head and heart. When one is far deeper, and more evident 
than the other, it indicates either that a person is ruled by his 
or her heart, or by his or her head. When it sits high on the 
palm, the person makes good, loving choices. Farther down, 
and closer to the Line of Head, it can indicate childhood 
problems leading to distorted ideas of love and friendship. 
The Line can display small branches sweeping upwards or 
drooping downward from it. Upwards indicates the natural 
flirt, and downward trouble with the opposite sex, or the sex 
of choice. A pale, broad line illustrates a noncaring attitude 
toward others, particularly in matters of love. A clear, deep 
line, presents energy and vitality in affairs of the heart. 
Breaks in the Line of Heart show disappointment in love and 
friendship. A chained Line of Heart, which is one made up 
of tiny island formations, speaks of someone who doens't 
trust others, especially in matters of love. These people often 
go from relationship to relationship, unable to establish any 
lasting connection. Sometimes, the chained formation will 
appear in only a small portion of the line, indicating that the 
person is able to overcome his or her mistrusting nature. 
Forked lines, either at the beginning of the line, which starts about an inch or so beneath the little finger, or at its ending, near the 
other side of the palm in a variety of positions, indicates an independent nature. Where the branches head tell another story. When 
a branch, or fork from the Line of Heart heads toward the index finger, it means the person has very high ideals, particularly in a 
mate. They expect a greal deal from the other person, but, in return, are supportive and loyal. 
When a branch heads toward the middle finger, the person is moody, and sometimes tempermental in the company of others. 
However, they often desperately want the security of a lasting relationship. Dual branches, or forks, that rest both on the index 
finger, and the middle finger shows individuals who truly wants to establish deep relationships, but who have trouble

relinquishing any part of their independence. Forks at the opposite end of the line, beneath the little finger, add strength to the line, 
if those branches are fairly deep, and free of any drooping hairlines. 
Ending beneath the index finger, the person is idealistic, but loving. If it swings up into the finger, though, the person can be 
demanding of others. A short line, ending near the ring finger, means the individual is stunted in his or her affections."

Reading the mount of Venus
The mount of Venus
Back to the Table of Contents
by Angela M. Mattey 
Palmists look at the palm as a terrain. So can you. Hold 
your hand palm up and flat in a perpendicular position to 
your face in front of you and at eye level. When observed 
from this position the palm looks like an earthly terrain 
with high hills (mounts) and valleys. Palmists have names 
for each small region of this terrain in the palm. Usually 
one of the larger mountains is what palmists call the 
"Mount of Venus" which connects the thumb area to the 
rest of the palm. This is the area I have traced with the 
dotted line. 
Within this area- the Mount of Venus - I have marked a 
grid of intersecting lines with an arrow pointing to it from 
the letter "A". The mount of Venus area of the palm is 
devoted to one's love of life and sometimes shows a 
fullness to symbolize the depth of love of life. When this 
mount is high, fleshy and very full, the person is full of 
passion for: life, most of the events that happen in their 
lives and the people who are within their life. The grid or 
grille as palmists would call this design found at "A" in 
figure # 3a, can tell you that you have "walled off " your 
heart from others lessening your attraction to connect with 
happiness both internal and external. This grid is usually 
not found on a high or full mount of Venus. This guarding 
of the heart, could be happening because you are still 
attached to someone from the past. If this grille design is 
simple - which means it is made up of just a few vertical 
and horizontal lines - it can mean that you are devoted to 
your present love interest and your heart is dedicated to that person alone. If you are not presently in a relationship the grid could 
symbolize bars, like the bars of a jail cell, where you keep your heart hidden and safely locked away because you are not sure you 
can trust someone or yourself in a heartfelt and committed relationship. This type of grid can cause great stress in any new 
relationship once it is underway and certainly can prevent a good relationship from ever getting started. 
I like looking carefully for alphabet letters and designs that appear in the Mount of Venus area of the palm to help me read 
questions about love. Sometimes there are one or more initials of the client's "significant other" shown here. If you notice there is 
an initial "T" in the area of the mount of Venus next to the grid in my design of figure # 3a. The "T" noted here is an example of 
what could be the initial of the first, middle or sir name of the intended love either presently available or upcoming into your life.

A sample reading routine
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Usually the dominant hand is read. But should you wish to hold both of her hands, modify your approach in the following manner: 
Non-dominant hand - the inner potential of the person
Dominant hand - the actual manifestation and realization of that inner potential 
An example routine 
1.  Describe her to her according to what you know about the various lines 
2.  Try to include qualities you've learned about her after having elicited her values and watching her behaviour in general, 
find the corresponding lines in her palm and show them to her. You can also use the collection of phrases below. 
3.  Predict something good/positive, don't forget to show her, how you draw your conclusions. 
4.  Keep holding her hand, look her in the eye, kiss her fingers. 
5.  "People may know each others' mind, but they don't really know each other until their bodies get to know each other":) 
Don't go overboard!:) 
Collection of phrases - dreamer, open, passionate, sensitive, adventurous, positive (add to this list). The phrases themselves are 
meaningless, elaborate on each phrase and describe the word through describing the feelings of a person that can be called "a 
dreamer" or "passionate". But don't shoot in the dark, make sure you know what you're talking about - hopefully you did at least 
some value-eliciting before you jumped into palm reading:) 
A few simple examples of reading lines: 
G     If she has two fate lines, for example if her fate line is broken mid-hand and another starts running parallel to it, see at what 
age it happens and voila, you've got a story:) Don't forget to show how you draw your conclusions or else she might 
suspect you of BS-ing, but show her the corresponding lines and she'll think ITS PURE GOLD AND THE ROCK-SOLID 
TRUTH:) "You'll stay on your chosen career path up to the age of about 30, then you'll find a new passion and finally 
switch over to it at the age of about 35." Simple:) So OK, we didn´t evoke any specific feelings, but believe me, the simple 
fact that a man that CAN PREDICT HER FUTURE is HOLDING HER HAND will make her feel everything tightening 
up you-know-where:) A break in the line of fate can also mean a change of geographical location, so you could also bring 
travelling, working or living abroad etc into play:) 
G     If her fate line breaks up at the base of her palm and/or interacts/intersects with the life line (which very many people have 
by the way) you can say the following (this is taken from www.spirit-eagle.com, but I really cannot recommend the site - 
it's all full of advice how to "contact your guardian angels and spirits" etc, very messed up stuff:): "(showing her) This 
means that early in life you experienced some family situation that made you have responsibility as a child. So much so, 
that you were given duties or existed in a situation where you had to let go of part of your childhood and be in an adult like 
role. But this usually gives you something nice later in life. Because you had to give up part of your childhood you are 
given extra life energy support later in life to survive a tough or a difficult experience with more ease and protection."

From a patterning point of view, this "childhood problem" theme was not too great. Should you however show her the 
appropriate lines in her hand, and she actually did have some childhood problems (and who us didn't?:), you have instantly 
become very close to her - close to her heart and soul, which is a very good place to continue from:) 
On the whole though, these are hardly examples you can memorise and use - they are only supposed to give you the general idea 
of how you could conjure up your own stories. 
A few closing words from dead-serious palmists: "As a palmist, your attitude is of great importance. Never try to "second guess" 
your subject by adding on-the-spot observations and facts you may know beforehand but which are not shown in the palm. If you 
are reading the palm; read the palm and only that. Ideally you should know nothing whatsoever of the person you are reading. 
Their hands and your intuition should be enough. Anytime you are meeting someone for the first time, you can pick up a tentative 
and often very useful first impression of their personality by unobtrusively glancing at the lines of their hand." 
But if that doesn't work, we'll just ask for her hand... so that we can get "an impression of her personality":)

How to switch to the right mindset
Back to the Table of Contents
Want a laugh? Check this out - "If I stand around long enough, maybe something will happen." Now take a look around in a night-
club:) See all those guys - standing or sitting, waiting? Now you know what they're thinking:) Pathetic:) Now go get all the girls:) 
In an everyday situation, those same guys are not specifically waiting for something to happen, they are simply oblivious. Pathetic 
again:) But what do you do? That's right, again, you go get all the girls:) 
In a night-club situation, now that you've had your laugh, whatever you do - don't join all the goofs standing or sitting and just 
watching the girls on the dance-floor! All that herd of chumps waiting and twiddling their thumbs is known as "death row", now 
you don't want to join them, do you!? 
Once you're in the door, it's action-action-action and worshipping the 3s rule. Sounds tough? No, you'll actually make it easier on 
yourself, especially considering the alternative - going home alone with a headache, remembering all the beautiful girls you only 
SAW and sleeping with your hand:)

Asking for a dance
Back to the Table of Contents
This one is tough. 
Ideally you should never encounter a situation where you'd have to "ask" for a dance. It is best to try any of the alternatives 
provided below before resorting to the demeaning and supplicating "Would you like to dance with me?". 
You can use Mr Smooth to start a dance with a group of girls. Or be on the dance-floor by yourself manoeuvring into position 
with a girl / a group of girls dancing by themselves. Or you can dance near the edge of the dance-floor and pull any girls passing 
by to dance with you. Or you can act like you already know the girl, take her hand, nod towards the dancfloor and say "well, come 
on!:)". If she seems reluctant, you go "oh, come on!:)". If she says "I'm tired", BOOM, you're in a conversation (you didn't even 
notice that, did you?:). "Tired? Well, not that you mention it, this place is a little crowded/noisy. Why don't we go to someplace 
quieter where we can talk and you can relax:)" If you let go of her hand in the meantime, grab it again and guide her to a nice and 
quiet little corner you've already checked out before:) 
Or - you can go the classic AFC way of asking a girl for a dance. If she says yes, great! If however she refuses, you're out of luck. 
You can try and salvage the situation by joining her for a conversation but she has refused you once already so a come-back will 
be that much harder to do. Or you can just move on, but remember - having other girls see you get rejected diminishes your 
chances with them even further. Which could result in the ultimate humiliation of moving from girl to girl and asking for a dance 
and being turned down all the way until you run out of girls:) Ok, the latter is unlikely, someone WILL eventually dance with you, 
but most probably that someone will be (yep, you guessed it:) - an UG!:) 
Ideally, rejection should never happen, for if you've had a chance to talk to her in a meaningful manner before, she is already 
dying to have a little kino and grinding with you on the dance-floor:) But amongst the deafening and blinding circumstances of a 
typical night-club, this can be hard to do. So she just takes you by face-value, and its gonna be a yes or no. 
Also, when doing an all-out "asking for a dance", some annoying factors might come to play, over which you have very little 
control owing to the approach you have chosen. She might be tired, waiting for a friend in a designated spot, just doesn't dance, 
her boyfriend is just around the corner. All these factors really have no bearing should you choose an approach which also 
incorporates demonstrating value and personality (beyond having the guts to ask for a dance). In which case "waiting for a friend" 
or "being tired" are quickly out the window... plus some more time with you and the "boyfriend" might share the same route:) 
But without having been able build rapport with her and make her crave for you, you really don't have too many options - maybe 
thank her, maybe ask her "how about later?" (yea right) or ask her "mind if I join you for some conversation?", nah, these all suck 
to high heaven, better just move on to the next girl. 
Theoretically, you might still stand a chance with her once she sees the girl that was smart enough to agree to dance with you 
having the time of her life:) But whatever you do, don't stand there and aggravate her by arguing with her as to why she won't 
dance with you. Forget her, move on, there's a better-looking and smarter girl (for she knows to appreciate your invitation:) right 
behind her, and YOU are what she's been waiting for all her life:) Or at least this evening:)

About dancing
Back to the Table of Contents
If dancing isn't specifically what you came to do in a night-club, then dancing isn't really what you should be concerned with. 
Dance your dance, then extract her to a quiet and private place and start working your magic:) You could of course get some 
initial attraction already going on the dance floor if your moves are good - smiles, eye-contact, maybe even some initial kino - but 
then again, maybe not. You know your stuff and you know it works, but dancing can only be helpful at best, it is not the way of 
achieving your goal. So have fun dancing, but keep your ultimate goal (be it a #close, a *close, feeling her up or tonguing her 
down, making her come right there in the club or taking her home with you:) in mind. 
The exception to this rule are the so-called kino girls. They LOVE being touched and they love to touch you in return. Should you 
happen to hit the dance-floor with a girl like that - don't leave, keep dancing, have fun holding and grinding each other:) Once the 
touching and kissing gets really intimate, you can change venues and no excess talk is needed:) Chances even are, she woulnd't be 
very receptive to any "talking" strategies anyway - while you are busy patterning or eliciting values, all she is thinking is: "Why 
isn't he touching me? Why does he just keep talking?". 
As for the rest of the girls, the amount of time you need to spend on the dance-floor depends on how well you dance. If you're 
good, dancing is an easy way of attracting girls - you can easily slip in with the most beautiful of girls on the dance-floor plus 
have everyone else on and off the floor check you out. If however you are average, do as suggested in the beginning - do your 
dance, then move to a quieter place to have a soul-to-soul, heart-to-heart and eventually a body-to-body discussion:) 
Update. Jake Thomson, ASF: "A woman I know & trust advised me one time that in her humble opinion, if man can't dance, he 
probably can't fuck either. Think about it. Being able to dance well demonstrates that you are comfortable in your body and know 
how to use it with precision and control. I know from my own experience, limited though it may be, that if a woman can't dance - 
she generally can't fuck very well either. If she dances well, it's a pretty good bet she knows how to fuck also. So it's one of my 
tests for fuckability." 
Dancing is an ancient pre-copulation ritual. It has been and in many parts of the world is still being "officially" used (some tribes 
in Africa, South-America) as the primary criterion for selecting a partner to copulate with. Unofficially though, you can see the 
same thing happening each night in every club/bar:) So one more reason NOT to waste your energy on dancing unless you know 
how to dance. Or one more reason to LEARN to dance:)

Slow dancing
Back to the Table of Contents
Slow dancing is another exception to the "you-didn't-come-here-to-dance" rule (see "About dancing" for the first few exceptions). 
It is a most excellent way of getting some more intimate kino started. If you hear an r 'n' b tune coming up, don't waste any time. 
Take the girl you're presently with to the dance-floor (unless you're in the middle of a pattern and she is about to fly higher and 
higher:) or if you're presently in that 3 second period of having #- and *closed one girl and not yet approached another (you 
haven't just been "hanging" around, not able to choose who to approach, have you?:), either immediately return to the girl you just 
closed or scope for a suitable target in your vicinity. 
While-slow dancing, be bold yet sensitive. Be bold - hold her really close to your body, start rubbing her back with your hand. Be 
sensitive - watch her reactions, if she starts to rub your shoulders, neck or chest or starts grinding her crotch against yours (hmm:), 
its once again time for you to… be bold - begin kissing her neck work your way up behind the ear, then the ear lobe, then closer to 
the cheeks, then lips…:) At this pointing you can just pretty much forget about patterns, eliciting values and what not. You can 
either stay on the dance-floor some more and grind it slowly and keep kissing even during a fast song or move smoothly to a more 
private corner for some more petting. Eventually you could check if the bath-room is available:) Or suggest a change of venue:)

Fast dance to slow dance
Back to the Table of Contents
You've seen them before - a guy and a girl on the dance-floor, ignoring all the other people diligently wiggling to the fast pace of 
the music and having a slow dance of their own, touching, kissing. A newly married couple on their honey-moon:)? Hehe, think 
again:) 
Maniac High describes a dance-floor PU technique of turning a fast dance to a slow dance, and a slow dance to a... oh darn, he 
had to leave before he could find out:) Anyway, here's the step by step description. Maniac High, ASF: 
"The PU was done with virtually no talking at all. The setting was a disco playing regular fast paced disco dance music. 
The guy and the girl make eye contact, and start dancing facing each other. He mirrors her dance moves, making eye contact. This 
happens for about 2 or 3 minutes. 
He puts his arm on her side, to her back, lightly, and is dancing, still following her pace. 
He puts the other arm on her other side to her back, but he does not pull her in. 
Now he slowly runs both hands up her body, to her armpits, and then up her arms (he raises her arms up in the air). 
Then when he reaches the tops of her hands, which are stretched out in the air, he (slowly), runs his hands down her body. His 
hands slowly slide down till they reach her ass. He doesn't grope it directly, but just they are above the top of her buttcheeks. The 
whole thing above (hands up to her hands, down to ass, is slow, takes about 1 or 2 minutes to travel the whole distance. 
Also, now, he has slowed down his dancing, and is not really following the music anymore, and she has slowed down too, (he 
slowed her down by mirroring her pace, and then slowing down as his hands were running up/down). [3 minutes] 
While his hands are on her ass, he moves his head in, and breathes softly on her neck. He does not try to kiss her. 
His hands move up/down her back slowly, while his head moves around her neck/side of neck, him breathing slowly, closely. The 
chicks eyes start to close. She is going into trance. [3 minutes] 
He moves his head and hands down her body, (still facing her), he like crouches down, slowly, as his hands travel down to her 
legs, then slowly moves up again, to her ass, and he is standing again, and is breathing on her neck/back again. [3 minutes] 
He now repeats the hand up/down things above from the top of this list, and the breathing a couple times. Each time he pulls her 
in closer. She is going way into trance now. [4 minutes] 
The last time he does the up/down hands thing, he raises his hands up to her hands in the air, and lets go, but leaving his hands up. 
This is her cue to now do the same thing to him, and she does. 
She runs her hands up/down his body slowly now, like he did to her before a few times. She clearly likes this, a smile is on her 
face... 
He turns her around (so her back faces his chest), and he does the same things again with the hands, this time from behind.. she

gets confused, when he tries to turn her, so he just tells her to turn around, she loses trance state... He does NOT go for her 
tits/cunt, etc..nothing overtly sexual.. She is back in trance again. [3 minutes] 
He turns her around again, so they are facing each other, and he is breathing on her neck/face. Now she is mirroring him and 
doing the same thing, breathing on his face/neck. 
This goes on a long time.he makes her wait for the kiss, and she is goes more into trance, she is just hanging on to him now..he 
does not rush things at all. [3 minutes] 
He starts breathing more on her cheeks, face, but does not kiss there... He continues until she is doing the same [2 minutes].. 
She is doing the same now, and their lips are breathing on each others face. This continues for what I thought is a really long time 
before the kiss starts [4 minutes] 
Finally, they slowly move closer lips together from each others lips. The lips lock, they kiss, and keep kissing... The kissing goes 
on for a really long time (15 -20 minutes)... 
Around then I leave with my chick, and don't see the rest of it (I suspect he just took her home ;-) ) 
Maniac's analysis. There was no talking during the whole PU (expect where he makes her turn around), just the way he touched 
her got her going. Firstly, he did NOT rush things. Also, it was obvious to see her states changing when he was doing the Kino. 
He did not advance until her state was ready. This was obvious from looking at her (her eyes closing, her `hanging' on him, her 
following his dance pace, and NOT the music when he slowed down.). He made sure this happened before going to the next step. 
She was also helping him by following his `body rapport'. Some chicks will/won't in my experience. Also, he did nothing overtly 
groping/sexual, ie. He didn't kiss her neck/ears before the first kiss (not sure if this is good/bad yet..I think best to wait until she 
accepts you by the "real" kiss first, then move to those other parts) 
[There's a choice to be made here - if a possibility of slight resistance can be expected, an initial neck/ear kiss is useful in slowly 
breaking down that resistance. If however not much resistance can be foreseen, abstaining from any kissing can really build up 
anticipation and pressure, so once the kiss finally takes place, it'll truely be a ride through the seven gates of heaven:) - tony] 
Didn't grab her ass in a groping way until the kiss/touch tits..etc. It was all very smooth and passionate looking until the kiss, 
without sexual groping/kissing neck/ears.. That is good, because it didn't scare her. 
He also took his time..the whole kino session was like 30 minutes from start to end. He was going REAL SLOW, even his dance 
pace didn't follow the music..very SLOW MOTION movements, as the chick dephased from the music rhythm, to his. He was 
very conscious too what he was doing, eyes open, looking like an engineer as he worked the chick into trance.He'd close them 
though when she could see his face. It was clear he had done this before and was following the "cookbook". 
He also made her wait for the kiss a bit, longer than I expected. It was good, he kept on touching her, / breathing really close to 
her, and that probably made her even more horny, making sure there would be no kiss rejection." 
There you have it, from "never-met" to "newly-wed" in 30 minutes:)

After the dance
Back to the Table of Contents
Goes without saying that you won't end the dance with saying "thanks" and walking away. You didn't come here to wiggle a 
little on the dance-floor:) But you also won't let her do the same. After the song ends and she seems to be willing to continue 
dancing with you, and unless she is a kino-girl (see "About dancing"), just take her hand and lead her to the table of your choice, 
somewhere where its relatively quiet and private. If it seems like she is about to bail, take her hand and say / whisper in her ear 
something in the lines of "I want to talk to you about something". Most probably she's gonna ask "about what?", just reply "I'll 
tell you when we sit down". From here on you can choose any of the strategies described in this guide.

If she is with a friend / a group of friends
Back to the Table of Contents
...also known as disarming the obstacles 
She is the target. The friend is the obstacle. Be it male a female, so many AFC's make the fatal mistake of ignoring the friend / 
obstacle when making sweet-talk with the target. An ignored obstacle is pissed and getting more pissed all the time. Undoubtedly, 
the target's friends have much more influence over her than you could ever exert in 5-10 minutes, which means that when the 
pissed obstacles will eventually start interfering with your conversation, dragging your target away ("come on, we have to go 
home / to another place" etc.), talking with your target and ignoring you, making comments and just generally breaking the 
mood… you're dead meat. If you were good enough to make the target interested in you, she might be able to slip you her number 
while her friend is already dragging her out the door. But more likely than not, in an atmosphere poisoned by the pissed presence 
of the obstacle, you'll never have a chance with the target. 
So now what? The only option is to befriend the obstacles before engaging the target. Make the target's friends - male, female, 
brothers, co-workers, whatever - your best mates before you move on to working you magic with the one that really drew you to 
their friendly circle in the first place. Have a good time doing it, make lots of friends, shake hands, be humorous, lift everyone's 
spirits. Make them laugh, feel good and like you:) Once you're done that, you can move to working your target without having to 
fear anything from your new-found buddies. Who, by the way, you have already negged by paying the least amount of attention 
to. This has gotten her intrigued about you as she's probably accustomed to being adored everywhere she goes:) But not by you, so 
either you're accustomed to beautiful women or there's something about her that you don't like, either way, she has got to find out, 
she has got to make you adore her, she is so accustomed to that, "why is she not paying attention to me!?", "gotta step up my 
efforts with this guy!", hehe:) (Don't forget to read Neghits explained and Neghits expansion pack:). 
One more thing - once you've disarmed the obstacle / obstacles and engaged the target, and this is critical, you need to separate 
her from her friend / friends. If she is with a friend, you better have a wingman to keep the obstacle busy and help in the effort of 
separating them. Very many girls don't like to be seen kissing or touching someone in front of others / friends. They have the issue 
of reputation to deal with etc. But once you're in a private place, she's free to do whatever she wants without having to think "oh 
no, what's my friend going to think about this", "is she gonna tell anyone / my boyfriend / mom?" etc. Let's say you separated two 
friends, you're with one girl and your wingman with another girl someplace else. You and the girl have no idea what you're your 
wingman and her girl are doing. But that doesn't mean you can't imagine:) This is where it gets interesting - she's gonna think her 
friend is probably already making out and having all the fun, maybe even having sex already:) While her friend is probably 
thinking the same thing:) So being separated and not knowing what the other one is doing, both of them are much more receptive 
to all sorts of advances:) 
Applied with a wingman: if your wingman and his girl seem to be getting along, tell your girl (without the other girl overhearing) 
that you should let those two be alone and leave. Your girl will certainly initially wonder, what you mean by that. "Open her eyes" 
with these:) - "Are you blind or something? Can't you see what they're up to? Or do you want to watch them:)? Don't you know 
how embarrassing it is when two people want to be alone and there's someone watching?". This should make her "understand" 
and now the two of you can leave. But the beauty of this is, that you leave with your girl thinking, that her girlfriend is gonna get 
some in a few minutes:) The girlfriend however sees the two of you leaving and can't help but think that you left so that you and 
your girl could go have some private fun:) Now that you've got both of them thinking, that the other one is going to get her brains 
screwed out in a few moments, neither of them wants to be left out in the cold - voila:)!

How to Lay Girls Guide
A simple variation of removing obstacles / negging the target, ASF: "You see HB and UG together - dance/talk/have fun with the 
UG instead, HB is surprised, jealous and starts making an effort. Perfect." 
Update 
Mystery, ASF: "To get a 10 you NEED 7 and 8 girls to PAWN. Make them laugh and the 10 in the other group will take notice. 
Then enter the group and be the center. NEG the target while you address the rest of the crowd. Be so intersting that they ask 
YOU questions. NEG the ten again in front of the friends. Then once the group likes you, close in on the target with a mood of 
"ok ok, I'll let you talk to me". You are appealing to her emotions. She felt bad for being left out and then you GIVE IN and make 
her the center of attention." 
Update 
Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): "Remember: there is often some (usually ugly) sour womens liberation girl in a group, 
who will stuff the momentum up which is what leads to missing out on "story nights". So make note of not leaving her out of the 
conversation. This girl can be very influential as she will pull the morality strings of the group (which is the last thing you need 
out there in jungle warfare). Get her interested in you and let the games begin. Make that ugly and mouthy girl of tje group like 
you, this will allow the others to act their slutty selves." 
Update 
Another example of getting a girl away from her friends by Zvi Aranoff, SS-list: "Pardon the interruption.. I'd like to tell you 
something and which I know you'll enjoy more in private. Believe me.." (motion with your hand to the side or lead her with your 
open palm to the side. And then to her friends -) "Excuse me ladies.. I'll borrow her only for a moment" (Once she's outside the 
flock -) "..the reason I took you aside is that... (paaaaaaauuuuzzzz) all your friends there are beautiful, of course.. but there is 
something about you that absolutely stands out (besides her tits, but don't tell her that!).... and I just HAD to tell you that. (Shut up 
until she asks or shows curiosity, then -) (give her a sincere compliment that has nothing to do with her beauty, of course, then -} 
and I hope you're the type of woman who can tell the difference between a pickup (gesture away) and a sincere compliment (sp)". 
Give her a knowing look (which you can use later on as an anchor), and walk away!! She'll run after you!

Approaching a group of many girls
Back to the Table of Contents
ASF: "I think groups of around 5 girls are fairly easy to approach. I don't think you have to entertain them ALL (this is valid if 
they're not all talking about the same thing but are rather segmented). What I do is I pick one of them... most of the time it's the 
one who seems the most bored and just start to chat it up... When I do an approach such as this.... RARELY will the other girls try 
to pull the girl away. Instead, it seems like it brings out the competitive spirit in the other girls... and then THEY will be the ones 
breaking OUR conversation and not the other way around. Now the girl you approach might not be very interested in you but as 
long as you look like your having a good time and your not getting completely blown off.... by god... IF THERE IS A GIRL IN 
THE GROUP WHO FINDS YOU ATTRACTIVE.. SHE WILL MAKE HERSELF KNOWN. She'll either give you very strong 
eye contact.... or she'll try to join into the conversation or she'll approach you. 
I guess a good rule to follow is if you disturb a conversation... then you better befriend everyone that was in the conversation or 
they'll become an 'obstacle'. I think that's when you end up having the other girls pulling the girls away."

How to have her leave the group
Back to the Table of Contents
By NightShadow. Mindlist: 
"I see a hottie talking to all of her friends and I want to meet her. 
[The following description is useless in this context, but it was *so much fun*, I just had to *leave it in*;) - tony]. 
She is wearing a beautiful knee high skirt/dress, her lips are ever so caringly outlined with just the right amount of lip stick to 
accentuate her slightly pouty lips. An angels face with a bed devils grin. Nice round firm breast, tight and shapely ass, legs that 
scream to be spread like butter with your hot knife of pleasure. 
Now, I bet half the guys on the list are going "WHAT WOULD YOU DO?", "She is with friends, you don't know her and she is 
that hot!?!?". 
I would just walk up to her and talk to her. These are the kind of women that want attention. I casually, but politely walk up to 
her, usually from behind (I like to wisper in her ear), lightly touch her arm and say "may I talk to you for a minute?" 
This is SO devious!!! It is the ultimate BREAK STATE, yet it is so nonintrusive that she WANTS to come talk to you. Her 
imagination will race and she will have no idea what you want to say to her. Even if she doesn't come over there (I give them 
about 2 minutes, make sure you either have a friend with you or friends near you so you can walk off easily) she will see you later 
and just HAVE to say something to you. 
This tactic works INCREDIBLY at bars, parties, clubs, parks, marriages, seminars, church, gyms (you can go workout and not 
look like you are waiting), work, EVERYWHERE!!!" 
Update. If she says "But I can't leave my friends" 
Not specifically relevant to the strategy described above, but still relevant to the general situation. If you're already alone with her 
in a public setting that she arrived at with her friends and now when you're ready to move to another venue ("Where are we 
going?" - "Club Myplace, you're gonna love it":) she comes up with the "But what about my friends?" line, then here's a 
suggestion by Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): 
"In a situation like that, you will have to keep the momentum going and cannot afford to break it because once you do you might 
find it very hard to get things rolling again. In response to the "What will happen to my friends" say somehting in the lines of 
"Don't worry about them. We haven't seen them for ages, so looks like they're not exactly worrying about you either. Besides, at 
this time of the night its every man for himself anyway:) Come on, let's go:)" Now grab her hand again, lead her outside and jump 
into a taxi:)"

Patterning explained
Back to the Table of Contents
Patterns form the core of Ross Jeffries' Speed Seduction technique. Patterns are scripts of describing various wonderful states of 
mind and feelings to a girl, seemingly having nothing to do with you and her (for example by describing the wonderful feelings 
and states that music, dancing, eating strawberries and chocolate etc can create), but subconsciously getting her aroused… by 
what you're saying and in effect by you:) You can either link all those wonderful feelings you make her feel by what you're saying 
by self-pointing at appropriate times (which is what Ross Jeffries recommends), but the simple fact that you're there while she 
gets all those feelings and that you are the originator of them should do the job as well:). 
Making her feel all those wonderful states not only means describing them to her, it also means giving her commands embedded 
in what you're saying to experience those states. Descriptions by themselves might not always work, she might not be paying too 
much attention and wander off in her thoughts, but once you've given her commands - "Feel it building... focus in on those 
feelings... surrender completely..." - she might first even be aroused by such commands by themselves, but she will definetly be 
much more attentive towards the descriptions you are about to offer. 
Patterns also contain subconscious messages known as binder commands. For example, an excerpt from a pattern: "… that's the 
way to do it. Now, with me, its different, because…" incorporates a binder command of "DO IT! NOW! WITH ME!", which will 
bind all feelings and desires her arousal has created to YOU. 
Once you have her attention, one of the most powerful methods of making her "feel" is using sexual metaphors. They sound 
innocent in the context of what you're saying, but she is bound to pick up on them and once you have her imagining all those 
phrases out of context… don't be surprised if she says has to go to the bathroom for a moment and you notice her seat is all wet:) 
A few examples of such phrases are: "Create an opening for it... feel that thought penetrate you.... you come over and over again 
to the same conclusion...". Now that you know what to look for, you'll find more phrases in the example patterns presented in this 
guide. 
One rather dubious aspect of patterns is the so-called weasel phrases. For example the phrases "…these values are below me" 
pronounced "BLOW ME!", "…a feeling of happiness" pronounced "hap-PENIS!", "…in you're mind" pronounced "YOU'RE 
MINE!", "…thoughts flowing in a new direction" pronounced "NUDE ERECTION!", "...the sky is so beautiful" pronounced 
"THIS GUY IS SO BEAUTIFUL!" - these double-meaning pronunciations are supposed to give her subconscious messages, but 
the effectiveness of such attributes of patterning are slightly questionable though. 
The main value of patterns remains in their ability to make a girl recall or imagine absolutely wonderful feelings and states of 
mind, while subconsciously linking them all to you. 
The other important aspects of patterning are:
Anchoring
Trance words
Quoting and stacing realities
Time distortion
Thought binding
Presuppositions and other "mind-tricks" 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/patterning.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:33:45 PM]

Anchoring explained
Back to the Table of Contents
A more advanced aspect of patterning is anchoring. Anchoring is an application of Pavlov's reflex in NLP (and also in Speed 
Seduction). A Pavlov's reflex is a conditioned reflex first explored and introduced by Russian scientist Pavlov. The core of his 
experiment was as follows - he rang a bell, gave a dog some food, the dog saw and smelled the food and started salivating. After a 
few times of repeating the process of ringing a bell, offering food and getting the dog to salivate, he eliminated the offering of 
food from the process. He just rang the bell and… the dog started salivating. By always ringing a bell while offering food, he had 
created a conditioned reflex in the test subject, which in this case was causing salivation by simply ringing the bell. 
The same conditioned reflex can be created in a girl - this is called anchoring. In patterning this means, that every time you see the 
girl light up with delight, smile, laugh or just feel damn good because of the wonderful feelings you are creating in her with your 
patterns, you touch her in a specific place (the shoulder, elbow, inside of her arm) thus planting an anchor (the ringing of the bell 
while offering food:), while saying something "it's a great feeling, isn't it?" to mask your touch. 
Let's say you've touched her elbow each time you've made her feel especially good three times already. If you now touch that very 
same spot on her elbow the same way you touched it on three previous occasions (applying the same amount of pressure etc.), she 
suddenly and unexpectedly has all those wonderful feelings, that were there when you planted the anchor, rush back to her 
without you having done anything else but touch her elbow (in other words: you just rang the bell without offering food, and she 
started to salivate:). If you're really good, you can plant different anchors for different feelings all over her body - an anchor of 
laughter on her shoulder, an anchor of excitement on her elbow, an anchor of feeling romantic on back of her hand and an anchor 
of feeling horny… on her knee:). 
Furthermore, anchoring is not confined to touching alone - you can also use the tone of your voice, some specific words (whisper 
"oh yes do it!" in her ear a few times when she orgasms, then whisper those same words in her ear when being on some fancy 
reception and watch her turn red from a wave of passionate heat and lust. You don't even have to hide anything, she can recognise 
those words as "familiar" but she still can't help herself:). 
It is however important not to overuse the anchors you have planted or she will eventually become insensitive to them. Ring a bell 
ten times without offering food and the dog will eventually stop salivating when hearing the bell ring. 
The most practical use of anchoring is probably being able the keep a girl on a constant high when she's with you. Evoke positive 
feelings, and whilst she's experiencing them, anchor those feelings. But even the best PUA-s cannot keep evoking good feelings in 
a girl on a continuous basis, sooner or later, for whatever reason (she might be tired, have some worries, whatever), her mood will 
drop. That's where the feelings you have anchored come handy. Fire off an anchor (if you anchored laughter and fun to her 
shoulder, touch her shoulder) and she's happy again:) With no excess effort on your part:)

Quoting and stacking realities
Back to the Table of Contents
Quoting has you say things through someone's else mouth - has you quoting somebody. This has the advantage of making the 
more timid or insecure girls feel more at ease with the content you are about to deliver and thus much more receptive to your 
suggestive talk, as you are not talking about her neither yourself but a "friend" of yours (this is also a good tactic to use when 
delivering a harsher than usual content (see the articles about "Sexual talk"). In order to understand what you are saying, she will 
have to apply everything you say to herself anyway, so don't worry about her not experiencing what your "friend" experienced:) 
On the other hand, using quotes might be a slight hindrance to your success with more open-minded and adventurous girls, who 
wouldn't mind you describing them your or their feelings, because should a direct speech be accepted, it is always much more 
powerful than speaking through quotes. With such a girl describe her feelings and she goes "Goosh, this guy really understands 
my feelings!", or describe your feelings and she goes "Goosh, this guy has such deep feelings!". She'll be wet either way:) 
As you shall see in the "Falling in Love" pattern, you can also quote an article, a lecturer, a TV-show, a book etc. All these quotes 
added up is called stacking realities - the way she will perceive it is that if the book says so, the article says so, the lecturer says 
so, his friend says so etc., then it must be true. 
The reasoning behind quoting is to give the more shy and emotionally fearful girls more distance to feel more at ease with any 
given subject - to not have either her or you overtly involved in your descriptions (don't worry, her and you will be involved in 
those descriptions in her mind:). Another way of making her more at ease with any given subject is to use the hypothetical "If you 
were to...", "If I were to..." constructions, which now have the two of you overtly involved in whatever you choose to talk about, 
but only in a hypothetical way. 
For example, use a "If I were to ask you…" in front of a "…what's the most important thing for you in a relationship…", the 
implication being that you're not really asking, finish that with a "…how would you describe it?" and you end up with a much 
more effective question of "If I were to ask you what's the most important thing for you in a relationship, how would you describe 
in?" than a blatant "what's the most important thing for you in a relationship?" on its own could ever be.

Talking about sex
Using sexual stories to get her horny 
Update. Examples of quoting to use sex-talk. Ross Jeffries: 
"I found this letter on the lawn that my neighbor's daughter wrote. She is only 14 . . and I read, "You really shouldn't think about 
going down on a guy as you talk to him (on the phone) and you shouldn't think about making love to a man passionately (who you 
hardly know: who you are casual friends with.)"." 
"Some men are so crude. I can't believe what I saw this dude do the other night. He walked up to this girl sitting at the bar next to 
me and said to her "Imagine us totally making out and you getting so incredibly turned on by it. If you were to feel that right now, 
try not to think about having me eat your pussy all night long and getting really horny." I can't believe a guy would ask a women 
to think about that all night long."

"You know, I have heard of guys being really crude towards women but you wouldn't believe what I saw last night. Well, I was 
sitting at this bar minding my own business when I saw this stranger walk up to this girl who was sitting next to me, look her right 
in the eye, and say " If I were to say to you that I'd like to eat your pussy all night long, would you get hot and horny or would you 
slap me and run away." Can you believe it! Did he really expect her to feel an incredibly lust inside, and enjoy imaging being 
made loved to all night long." 
"My neighbor Cheryl acted so weird to me the other day. Do you know what she asked me? . . . She goes "John, Imagine you and 
me totally making out." And I'm like, "Cheryl, your 10 years older than me. And she says "wait, see this through your own eyes. 
Imagine you and me really enjoying ourselves passionately making out" I said, "No Cheryl, this isn't going to work out. And she 
says, "NO NO NO, just imagine it for a moment, just imagine us making out and you getting so turned on." Did she really expect 
me enjoy thinking about that over and over again, to the point where you can't get it out of your mind. If she does that again, next 
time I think I'll play it right back to her. Like say something like "Tell me Cheryl, What's it feel like when you experience 
fantastic sex when you're with someone who, you know mmmmm really knows how." 
"You know I think it's so strange how people come up with things right out of the blue. My neighbor looks at me and says STOP 
and just . . . picture the . . . two of us . . . absolutely in love. Able to feel . . . totally connected, completely drawn to each other. 
What would it feel like then if I was kissing you exactly the way you like it, touching you exactly the way you like it, holding my 
body close to yours. God, did she really expect me to have those thoughts _____ Now with me, I know it takes time. I would 
never feel that right away. Its the kind of thing you go home and think about. You just picture it right up there in your mind find 
yourself dreaming those wonderful dreams of love with this special person you are now connecting so powerfully with. But you 
can't think about it on the spot as well." 
"You know, sometimes I think women are so strange. I can't believe you all. Well, the other day, I was talking with my friend 
____ and she looked at me and she said, "If you were to imagine we were in love, what are the two of three things about me that 
you could say that just cause you to fall in love with me the most." Now I can't believe, that's not the kind of thing you ask 
someone to think about on the spot. It's the kind of thing you might find yourself pondering. You know, maybe when you're doing 
everyday things like driving your car or taking a shower and you find that you think about it to the point where you can't get it out 
of your mind. I know its a wonderful thing to feel a growing desire for someone (sp) to the point where you imagine yourself with 
them in a mmmmm special way. But really, people shouldn't do that." 
"You know I ask women what they think is the worst pickup line they have ever heard. Well, this woman told me what happened 
to her once .. this guy walked up to her in a bar, looked her right in the eye and said "imagine me going down on you just the way 
you like it all night long and you were getting so hot and so wet that you were begging to have me inside you". Did that jerk really 
expect her to have those thoughts ... with me I would never say such a thing."

Time distortion
Back to the Table of Contents
Time distortion is having her think about a time in the future and her feelings for a special somebody "say six months from now" 
(see "Falling in Love" pattern). If you've done a good enough job, that hypothetical special somebody in her imagination will be 
you! She feels safe and secure with that as it is only her fantasy, just a thought, and nobody knows about it. Or at least that's what 
she thinks:) 
But even if she doesn't imagine you as her special somebody, it doesn't matter. The object of time distortion is to have her imagine 
you and her six months from now, not even necessarily as lovers, just have her experience the thought of having known you for 
six months already. And before she knows it, she feels much more safe and secure with you, as if she has known you for a long 
time already (like... say... six months?:). 
ASF: "It's really pretty simple. You just make up some bullshit fantasy that takes place in the future involving you and her and 
explain it to her. By the time you #close, it's almost ridiculous because she FEELS LIKE she has known you for so long already 
because you have taken her mentally to the future and in order to understand that she has to IMAGINE KNOWING YOU FOR 
MONTHS. She has imagined that you are good friends and like each other and travel together etc. You should see the looks on 
their faces when you say "so what's your number?", they can't believe how close they feel to you and you don't even have their 
number:)" 
Update. Example of a time distortion story (taken from "Sweep women off their feet..."): 
"There was this girl I met over the Internet who would only respond once in a while, making me wait as long as two weeks for a 
reply if any at all. At one point I decided to put a stop to it. I wrote her the following little story: 
"I know that right now it's hard for anyone to recognize when they meet the person they want to share their lives with, especially 
with the overload of information and male congestion on the Internet. But sometimes I think that Mother Nature provides food for 
every little bird in this world but that doesn't mean it will drop it in its nest. People are the same way. There is someone out there 
for every one of us, but we still have to go out there and find him or her. 
With that in mind I cannot help but look into the future and see a young woman asking her grandmother for advice in the matters 
of the heart. You look at your grand daughter with love in your eyes, speaking in a kind voice, recalling moments from your youth 
when you weren't sure whether your heart was melting for the right man. Then you smile and tell her to trust her heart even if her 
mind says no, because there was a time when a young man was desperately trying to get your attention but for some reason he 
could not find his way into your heart. Just before you decided to put an end to his misery he wrote one compelling letter straight 
from his heart and that's when you knew he was the man who deserved your love. Your mind was still not convinced but you 
decided to let things happen at least for the sake of finding out for sure. Though it wasn't immediate, your heart and mind 
surrendered to the power of love. Had I given up at first we wouldn't be here talking about matters of the heart my dear girl, for 
that young man was none other but your grand daddy." 
That one email alone made her not want to miss out on such a perfect future."

Falling in Love patterns
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Pattern 1 
An example of using quoting, stacking realities, anchoring and time-distortion. Using Ross Jeffries' original as the basis. 
You: "You know... I was reading the most interesting article about how men and women fall in love differently. And it was saying 
that men usually feel an attraction first, but that women, by contrast, usually feel a connection and then become more attracted. I 
mean, you know that kind of special connection you sometimes feel... that mysterious compelling click that takes place right 
THERE (touch her solar plexus, thus planting an anchor:)..." (See anchoring) 
Don't forget that she might interrupt you any second and start talking about her feelings. Let her! Encourage her! Be ready to 
change the course of the conversation, listen to her trance words, anchor the feelings while she describes them to you. (See trance 
words) 
You: "So... this article was saying, that when it's really special... that's when you can just STOP... and IMAGINE a time in 
future... say six months from now...blah blah blah". (See time distortion) 
You: "(having directed the conversation in the direction of how men and women fall in love differently) You know, I was telling 
my friend about this, and she was saying, when she really starts to FEEL THAT CONNECTION.... and GROW even more 
attracted… she begins to pay attention in a special way. First, becomes aware... of the rhythm of her breathing... the beating of her 
heart... and that sense of growing fascination... such that as she continues to be aware of all this... one particular feature of the 
guys face begins to rivet her attention... so as she just continue to keep looking… it's like the rest of the environment disappears... 
and the entire world becomes this face... this voice that just start to wrap itself around her like a pair of powerful but gentle arms... 
pulling her in... deeper.... just allowing that warmth surround her… etc. etc:)" 
Well, by now the situation should be ripe enough for you to throw in your own opinion about the subject:) You could make up a 
pattern of your own or acquire some ready-made patterns from Ross Jeffries at www.seduction.com (they cost a lot though, I'm 
talking hundreds of dollars).

place in your mine. 
You don't even know why you just have to go deep inside and find all those values that are so important to you but you just

when you look through the eyes of attraction, look through the eyes of desire, that's when you can make that connection and really 
feel that growing bond growing more and more as you begin to imagine being with this person, in that special way that two people 
can feel so wonderful. 
And as you feel that passion growing more and more maybe to a point where you feel yourself just letting go completely as you 
allow this person to come deep inside releasing all those feelings that have been building and building up inside, you just want to 
release them in a flood and I find when you do that now with me I find you just feel so enchanted like you are now under a love 
spell cast upon you such that you can't control yourself and just find yourself going wild with it, and feeling so powerful a desire 
for this person where you feel so warm inside, and ready for them to come deep inside you, that you imagine: "mmmm how 
wonderful it will feel you and me together". 
So this article was saying, that when it's really special, that's when you can just stop and imagine a time in the future, say years 
from now still feeling that growing attraction and looking back on this moment as being the inevitable start of it. 
My friend ____ was telling me that her roommate has this best friend Dawn. And when Dawn starts to notice that growing 
attraction, it happens in a certain way. 
Like first, as she looks at the guy, and starts to really pay attention, she just becomes aware of certain things like the rhythm of her 
breathing, and the beating of her heart, and the out line of his face so as she becomes aware of all these things, one particular 
feature of his face just starts to rivet her attention. So she becomes totally absorbed in the connection taking place and as that's all 
happening, it's like the warmth of his voice, this voice that just wraps itself around her like a pair of powerful but gentle arms .. 
pulling her in ... deeper ... just allowing that warmth to spread all through her... the deep rich warmth of it just starts to penetrate 
her thoughts, and as her heart beats faster and her breathing increases, that warmth just heats up into fire, a fire spreading through 
her chest and down through her belly, a fire pounding and pulsating all through her, down to where she longs to have it go, until 
that desire for him just becomes utterly overwhelming, and she just surrenders to it completely. 
...such that she opens herself up completely and allows this person to come inside her so deep releasing all those feelings that have 
been building and building and building that she just wants to release those feelings in a flood. 
I find when I HAVE those responses .. it's like you just let yourself go completely ... and go wild with it ... now that's how I see it 
so clearly. Now what really fascinates me about all this is not just how people connect so powerfully .. but how people connect 
with their own needs and wants and desires." 
Pattern 3 
Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...": 
"If you met the guy of your dreams today, would you let him know first or would you first tell all your girlfriends about this guy 
you met and how you think he is THE ONE?" 
"I'd know right away but I don't think I could tell him right away." 
"But would you tell your girlfriends?"

"I guess." 
"Just as I thought. That's interesting because it's a known fact that guys brag to their friends about the new girl they picked up 
when they were rejected yet they never say a word when they really meet a girl and fall in love. Women on the other hand are the 
exact opposite. They get so emotional when they meet their soul mate that they have to share the news with their girlfriends. The 
sad thing is that most people fail to recognize when they meet their soul mates or if they do they don't have the courage to find out 
for sure for fear of disappointment. That's why there are only a few people out there who ever get to experience true love, because 
they are not afraid to experienced it. Do you feel this…(squeeze her hand or at least make some kind of contact)…is the way it 
really is?…with me, now…I think most people know it but still deny it hoping that one day something will just happen out of the 
blue, but it will never happen until they just allow it to happen." 
Pattern 4 
Ross Jeffries: 
"Have you ever thought about the difference between attraction and falling in love? 
Well actually I think they take place in different settings. I mean, attraction is what you experience when you are in the presence 
of that person, (point) and you look at him and you think to yourself . . . mmmmmm, and you start to have certain thoughts, 
images and you know what that feels like, right? 
But falling in love, well I think takes place when your not even in that person's presence. I mean, can you remember a time when 
you totally fell for someone. . . . And as you are looking at me, thinking about what I'm saying, you can remember how that felt, 
don't you. 
Yea, but here's how it happened. You spent some time with that person (point) and then you went home and you picture that 
person in your mind (frame) right? And then maybe you imagine yourself in all sorts of situations with this person (point) having 
lots of fun, and enjoying the feelings and things you like to enjoy with them. Can you remember how that feels? 
And then maybe you start to list all the qualities about him you really like: He's so funny, he's so smart, he's so fun to be with, 
whatever they were, whatever the things are that you really want and enjoy that with someone (point), right? 
Then you get this feeling in the pit of your stomach, right in your solar plexus that just starts to spread out and lets you know that 
you really, really love this person (point). I mean, can you feel that as I describe it to you? 
And then, here's the real kicker . . you start saying his name outloud, you start bringing it up in conversations with your friends, 
and maybe you even dance around the house singing it if your a real goof, right? 
See, I think everything, including falling in love is a process. And when you do that process with someone (point) and really let it 
happen, that's when the magic takes over, the magic we're really all looking for. 
Of course, sometimes that can take months, but the real magic is when it happened instantly and you know it right away. That's an 
incredible feeling, isn't?" 
Pattern 5 
A minor modification of the previous pattern. Ross Jeffries: 
"I was reading in a book about the difference between attraction and being in love. 
And it was really interesting to learn that attraction takes place when like someone is sitting across from you and you just notice 
something about them ... could be anything. The expression on their face, or some unique feature that just captures your attention, 
or maybe its just their voice, the way it might wrap itself around you like a pair of strong, warm but gentle arms and just 
penetrates your thoughts and spreads all through you. Whatever it is, it all that takes place in this person's presence.

How to Lay Girls Guide
But falling in love is what you'll do yourself, after you've gone outside this person's presence. I mean, think about it ... what 
happens is you spend some time with this person and then you go home and you then you picture this person and your mine, in 
that special place and you mine, where you keep people you care deeply for. And then what you do is you start to imagine being 
with this person in different situations and in all sorts of different ways like maybe introducing him to your friends or having all 
sorts of fun and interesting adventures together. 
And then maybe what you even do is you start to list all the qualities that you really like about this person and for every quality 
thing you mention to yourself you get that feeling right in there where you get that warm feeling and with every feature you notice 
that this feeling increases, like oh he's so smart, or he's so much fun to be with, of he's so understanding of the world. And then, 
what you do is you start to repeat his name to yourself and then what you do, the real kicker is you start bringing up his name in 
every conversation, John said this or John said that and that's when you know you're absolutely hooked on this person, you know 
what I mean? 
And I think when you do that, now, with me, I find that that's when you really feel that passion growing and you don't even know 
why you just have to stop and go deep inside and just allow this person's presence to penetrate you consciousness and come inside 
you so deep and when that's happening its like that feeling there it just starts to move down, deeper as you create an opening for it, 
an opening, that just feels all those feelings that have been stored up, and they just start to flood through that opening... you know 
what I mean?" 
Pattern 6 
One of the basic structures of a seduction is to model the process of falling in love. The setup in this example has the couple 
looking at a newspaper on the movies page with the male commenting on one of the male actors but of course you can modify it 
to your liking as it is fairly easy to introduce the "cute actor/singer/pop-star" theme into almost any conversation. Jobet Claudio, 
Mindlist: 
Him: He's cute ain't he? 
Her: Yeah. 
Him: What exactly do you feel when you look at a cute guy (gesturing to your face). 
Her: Hmm... I just feel a tingle of sorts (hah... that's one for the echoing). 
Him: You like romance movies, don't you? 
Her: Yeah. I love em. 
Him: I'm just curious as to why you like romance movies. 
Her: They make me feel so good... you know. 
Him: Yeah. It can make you FEEL THAT TINGLE, (pts) I bet. 
Her: Yeah. 
Him: Well, I'm curious again. How do you know that YOU'RE FALLING IN LOVE with a guy (pts)? 
Her: Well... I... I don't know... it just happens and I just realize it. 
Him: Well... I read somewhere that there's this guy who researched about how women fall in love. In that study, he said that 
invariably (hah... Cialdini authority) women (point to her) at first find this small "gateway"... this thing that they notice about a 
guy (pts)... it may be small or big, like a dimple, or a smile, or the eyes, or a soothing voice... anything. Then, the woman begins 
to feel a tingling sensation when this guy (pts) is around... And the funny thing is, this guy's (pts) presence creates a certain 
richness of experience for women (pth), like, even small things, like a glance, or a look in the eye (look in her eyes), or a short, 
simple, soothing chat... all that... takes on a special meaning, that special, delicious feeling, you can't even begin to describe... 
that's when you realize that...THIS GUY IS SPECIAL (pts)...and special, in a special way... 
Pattern 7 
Talking about past relationships is an excellent chance to talk about the subjects of falling and being in love. But there is an added 
bonus to it - you can talk about it referring to your former love interest and you together as "we" and you can talk about what that 
"we" felt describing it in the present tense. Like this: "The beginning was so beautiful... its like... everything around fades away... 
and when we are looking into each other's eyes... we can see each other's souls". Did you notice the ambiguity? "We"... "are

How to Lay Girls Guide
looking into each other's eyes":)? Jobet Claudio from Mindlist elaborates: 
"Most women are suckers for love stories. Win or lose, success or failed, they really love love stories. Invariably, when in a 
conversation with a woman, the topic of love stories (as referenced to yourself) will often crop up as you talk about ex-boyfriends, 
current boyfriends, current girlfriend, ex-girlfriends etc. 
Now, the "we", in the context of the story-telling, should refer to the ex and myself, but then again, "we" is ambigous. Coupled 
with a couple of hand gestures and more referential ambiguities, conscious use of the "we/us" paradigm could be one of the most 
subtle, insidous and undetectable, non-verbal referential index shifts I know. 
[Example] 
Me: So, you have a boyfriend? 
Her: Not right now. Last one I broke up with a few months ago... how about you? 
Me: Yeah, same here. It was a beautiful relationship. Too bad it had to end the way it did... Its like... at first... we are so much in 
love. We feel that the whole world is revolving around us... you know what it's like to FEEL TOTALLY IN LOVE, don't you? 
We're like that (gesture back and forth). It's like, when we look at each other's eyes (look into her eyes)... we can see... into each 
other's soul... and we can SEE... and... FEEL... that love... burning within the both of us... warm and close enough to touch (touch 
her forearm, or a non-touching gesture towards her chest)... and that bond between us... really so strong... so powerful... so 
overwhelming... It does become that way at times, now doesn't it? 
[End example] 
It's totally disarming, since you're supposed to be talking about a past love. What happens though is that that past loves serves as a 
springboard into a process that evokes the state of love in the woman you're talking to."

Bullshit fantasies
Back to the Table of Contents
Girls love to dream. So dream with them:) First - they'll identify with you more strongly ("wow, a guy that likes to dream as 
well!"). But more importantly - dream a dream that is to her liking, and that liking will quickly translate into liking YOU:) Apart 
from being an application of time distortion to make her feel like she's known you for a long time, bullshit fantasies is also a 
powerful rapport and intense emotions creater, with all of those feelings quite naturally being linked to you. As they are just 
fantasies and dreams which are safe to share, the girl's possible resistance to participating will be almost non-existent, yet the 
feelings created can become very real indeed:) 
Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...": 
"Even girls who are after power and money will screw the living crap out of you if they feel you are an investment that will bring 
the results they want. If you show them that you are passionate about something that has potential to bring success, power and 
money they won't be able to resist you even if that success, power and money is currently lacking. They simply look at you as an 
investment and they will put out just so that they don't lose out on this great "investment". 
If she believes that you both like and want the same things she can still become very attracted to you if she also believes that you 
know more than she does about how to get those things that you both want, even if you don't deliver those things or feelings at the 
moment. She can become attracted to you if she believes that you will reach those goals faster than she will. She can become 
attracted to you if she believes you can show her how she can get what she wants. 
For example, looking back at a scenario involving a girl who loves money and power. Even if you don't have that money and 
power, talking about how you will have all of that in the near future will go a long way. You can describe all the luxuries yet to be 
enjoyed and how wonderful it will be. Be as descriptive as you can and try to involve her in the realization of this dream that 
WILL COME TRUE. Get her to imagine herself as part of this wonderful life and don't be stingy on the details. You can even 
describe how you look forward to sharing this wonderful life with that "special someone". You can describe how the freedom of 
your riches will allow you the opportunities to fulfill so many fantasies, especially the ones about making love on a white sandy 
beach, or making love under the waterfalls in the wilderness on a tropical island etc. While you are talking about all this, use your 
body to link it all to you. Touch her lightly with a soft caress on her arm when you describe something soft and sensual. Squeeze 
her hand firmly when describing something of intense passion while you maintain eye contact all throughout."

Thought Binding
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Ross Jeffries: "The first key to understanding Thought Binding is to recognise that people are basically hypnosis machines. If 
you tell their minds in what direction to move will absolutely DO IT EVERYTIME because people are not use to hearing these 
kinds of instructions. People are used to hearing babbling about content, in other words, reasons, data and facts, and that kind of 
stuff they can, do and WILL resist. But binding the direction of their thoughts? NEVER! Let me give you an example. Suppose 
their is some very nice young girl you want to impress. You could tell her lots of stuff about you. Ya know, say something dumb 
like: 
"Well lots of women like me because I'm smart and funny and make good money, but other's find it's my honesty and looks that 
they are attracted to". 
Yeah. Right. Well, problem is, you are tossing those facts, reasons and info at her, and like as not, she's heard this a zillion times 
before and isn't gonna buy it. If you must use an approach like this, why not bind the direction of her thoughts first? You'd do it 
like this: 
"Hey, did you ever meet someone, and just instantly knew that you had to get to know this person better (point to yourself)? 
Maybe as you went inside and really got all excited about how much fun it'd be to get to know him and how curious and 
intrigued you were feeling? As you REMEMBER THOSE FEELINGS AS WE'RE TALKING, I'm just curious, do you first 
imagine how much fun they'd be to hang out with, and then get intrigued, or do you get intrigued first and then imagine how 
much fun this person would be (point to yourself)?" 
Now, what are you doing here? You're setting up a mood and state of mind that's going to make her a lot more receptive by:
1.  Having her recall what it's like to be in the mood you want her in (setting up the thought direction). 
2.  Giving her a command to STAY IN THAT MOOD WHILE SHE TALKS WITH YOU by using the phrase "as you 
remember those feelings as we're talking" (Binding the thought direction). 
You've now set her up to be MUCH MORE RECEPTIVE to any "facts" about yourself you want to throw because you've set up 
and BOUND the direction of her thinking and emotional processes. From here on out, unless you are very stupid, she's dead 
meat. And the beauty is THEY NEVER CATCH IT, cause they aren't used to hearing it or looking for it. They just know they 
find you mesmerising, hypnotically fascinating and irresistibly attractive:) Notice also that we end by asking them about the 
order in which they did the process. That's to further mask the fact that we are giving commands by making it seem like the only 
reason we brought it up in the first place is we we're genuinely interested in learning about them! Ha! Are we sneaks, or what? 
By the way, the phrase "AS YOU REMEMBER"... is what we call a pre-supposition. A pre-supposition is just anything that 
HAS to be ASSUMED to be true in order for the sentence to make sense and be understood. Thus, with "AS YOU 
REMEMBER", the presupposition is that they WILL remember. Slick, isn't it? 
Every decision people make is based in and dependent on their state of mind. If you don't like their decision, change their state of

mind before you try to change the decision. So the key here, is to set up the right state using some of the thought binding 
techniques we've discussed, but also to recognise, that if you're getting resistance from a woman in the form of broken dates, 
calls promised but not made, etc., you need to back up and ask yourself the following questions: 
1.  Hmmm. What state of mind is she in right now with regard to me? 
2.  What's the final state I want her in? 
3.  How can I have fun transitioning her to the state I want her to be in when I pounce? 
You can think of this as building a chain of states, with the state she's currently in as the first link, and the final state you want 
her in as the dog collar that's gonna go 'round her neck! Let's say she, for whatever reason, is in a state of INDIFFERENCE about 
going out with you. And let's say the final state you want her in is DROOLING OF DESIRE TO BE WITH YOU. Bit of a gap, 
huh? What you need to do here is come up with a state in between as a nice transition, like say, curiosity or intrigue, using some 
of our thought binding/pre-supposition techniques. You could try something like this: 
"You know, when we go out, I don't know whether it will be an incredibly exciting adventure or just a wonderfully fun time, but 
it sure is going to feel good to laugh a lot, isn't it? When you think about it like that, are you aware of how much more it makes 
you really look forward to doing it?" 
Now, that's LOADED with presuppositions. They are: 
1.  That we are GOING to go out. 
2.  That it's either going to be incredibly exciting or wonderfully fun. 
3.  That we are going to laugh a lot. 
4.  That she's thinking about it like that. 
5.  That it DOES make her look forward to doing it (the only question is how aware of it she is... this is a whole sub-class of 
"awareness" presuppositions, using words like "aware" "recognise" "know" "realise" etc.) 
Now, does this sort of thing work? YES! IF... you deliver it with a smile and a laugh and say it like you MEAN it and expect that 
it's going to work! See, you need to make your tonality and delivery convey that YOU presuppose a POSITIVE outcome for your 
entire communication!!! So, the rule is to ALWAYS presuppose a positive outcome in your communication and ALWAYS 
present a communication that forces her to presuppose accepting AND (and this is a VERY important "and") ENJOYING IT! If 
you don't link fun and pleasure she's going to reject the entire communication!!! If you DO link pleasure and communication she 
won't resist cause she WON'T WANT TO!!!"

Presuppositions and other "mind-tricks"
Back to the Table of Contents
Partial Estonian translation 
(based on Ross Jeffries' newsletters) 
Presuppositions
Presuppositions are some of the most widely used "mind-tricks" in making it easier for the girl to realise, what it is that she really 
wants (and then go with the flow:). They shift attention from something (seemingly) unimportant as it has somehow already been 
agreed upon to the (seemingly) important as it needs yet to be decided upon. In order to understand the question and answer it 
("would you like tea or coffee?") she has to accept the presupposition that accompanies the question ("…before we go to my 
place":). 
G     "Would you like (something to drink) before (I take you home)?" 
G     "Would you like (another coke / whiskey) before (I take you home / we go to your place / we go to my place)?" 
Presuppositions can also be used in ordinary sentences to help her decide… or rather, decide for her:) If you'd like to take a 
shower together with her after spending the night together, instead of asking "Wanna take a shower? How about… um… we… 
together… um" say "I'll ready the shower for us:)". 
Here are a few more examples of how a simple sentence can help a girl sway towards the right decision:) …or simply not leave 
her with much choice:) Use these to construct your own "decision-swayers". 
Binds of comparable alternatives
G     "So do you want to meet me again tomorrow over lunch, or over coffee? (keep talking!) e.g. Either way, the most 
important thing is that we can carry on this conversation. Sound good to you?" 
G     "So do you want to dance now, or wait until the next slow? (keep talking!) You're looking as if YOU CAN'T WAIT to 
dance now. Let's go!?" 
Cause & Effect
G     "You won't get the most out of the music just thinking about it, since the best way to experience it is to dance with me." 
G     "As you sit there, you know you have to dance before the night is out. Come:)" 
Resistance-breaking patterns
Two mini-patterns using time distortion, binds of comparable alternatives and humour to break a girl's resistance to getting 
together with you:

G     "Won't it be great AFTER we've gone out and laughed and felt really comfortable together? Then you can just look back at 
it all, smile that smile of satisfaction, and think to yourself: that was one of the best times, I've ever had!" 
G     " I don't know, when we go out, whether it will be a wonderfully fun adventure or just an incredibly enjoyable good time, 
but it sure will feel great to laugh that much, won't it?" 
An example of using a combination of the above techniques and thought binding: 
You: You know, I can tell you are a woman with great taste!
Her: How do you know?
You: Because you laugh at what I say. And the more you laugh, the more you'll recognise just how attractive you find that... and 
the more you'll look forward to being with someone just like that / the more you'll LOOK FORWARD to having the best time 
when we go out!
Her: (laughter)
You: See...just like that:)
You: Seriously...haven't you ever met someone, and you just knew you were going to like this person (point to yourself), cause 
you could just STOP, and IMAGINE BEING TOGETHER, feeling totally comfortable, and absolutely connected, for all the right 
reasons?
She: Yeah
You: Well, see? So, as you think about it like that..." 
...then just keep chatting, transition to IC pattern, whatever. 
Update. An example of a presupposition by Vampire2727, ASF: "After finding out what the girl likes to do, talk with the 
assumption that you're going to do it: "Well, when we're doing [this and this] together, it would be better if [something and 
something]"."

Calibrate the girl
Back to the Table of Contents
Before you can start making the girl feel good, elicit and interpret her values, reflect them back to her, experience states of 
pleasure and hornyness etc, you have to know how to interpret her specific signs of feeling either good, bad or neutral. You can of 
course guess that a smile or "doggy-dinner-bowl-look" are good and a yawn and a frown of boredom are bad, but the signs are not 
always that clear. So in order for you to be able to acquire more accurate data on how the girl is reacting to each theme you bring 
up, question you ask or direction you go with the conversation, you shall first have to calibrate her for her reactions. 
Jake Thomson, ASF: "Find out, by asking, what she looks like when she agree's with something. Find out, by asking, what she 
looks like when she disagrees with something. Find out, by asking, what she looks like when she's nuetral about something. 
Make a game out of it. Tell her you're practicing to be a 'psychic' and you want her to help you. Ask her to think of something she 
whole heartedly, enthusiastically, and strongly agrees with. It's irrelevant if she tells you what it is, matter of fact, it's better if she 
keeps it to herself. Then ask her to think of something she feels nuetral about. Observe what she does. Repeat this cycle two more 
times. Then have her think of something she wholeheartedly, enthusiastically, and strongly disagrees with. Go to neutral, and 
repeat two more times. 
Next, ask her to think about anything she wants, and you, based on your careful observation, will tell her if she agrees, doesn't 
care, or disagrees with. Play that game for a while, then drop it, and move on to something else for a while." 
According to Jake Thomson, you should use this to progress to doing a cold-reading of her palm (that is without any knowledge 
of palmistry) or analyze her handwriting etc by feeding her something and either deepening it if she shows signs of agreement 
with it or moving on to something else is she is showing signs of disagreement. But the principles of calibration described are 
applicable on a far larger scale than just as prep-work for a gimmick. 
NYC, ASF: "I would always wonder why guys would ask "how do you know when she..." because in general, I ALWAYS 
KNOW! The reason I know is I basically give them a "lie detector" test before sarging them. What I mean is that I deliberately, 
yet naturally in the course of conversation say things that I KNOW will push them in a direction. 
I notice how they are normally... then when they mention their pet cat or something, I might say "did your cat ever get hurt?" and 
watch her face change and her body change when she considers her cat getting hurt. Then I might say "Does your cat wake you up 
in the morning?" and watch her change to that too. Not those sentences or topics in particular, but since I don't talk BULLSHIT 
FLUFF with chicks, I get them going in all directions before sarging... unless it's just time for caveman kino:) 
Anyway... by the time I am ready to move on them, I KNOW how they react to good stuff and bad stuff. When I QUOTE to a 
chick about getting a blowjob from some other chick in the past, she might THINK she is not reacting to what I said, but she is 
going through the same changes as thinking about her cat when she considers her mouth around my dick. She is either going to 
have the "happy" reactions or the "sad" reactions or the "I don't give a FUCK about what he just said" reactions. I always know 
when I am moving physically closer to a girl if she WANTS me to do it, is LETTING me do it, or HATES me doing it... before 
she even speaks. When I move toward her, she has to consider what I am coming over there to do, and it is OBVIOUS to me how 
she FEELS about it without her saying what she feels about it. This makes me look like a fucking CHAMPION because I seem to 
"sense" what she's feeling without her telling me. "We are so in tune blah blah blah...". 
I think this idea is PARAMOUNT! If you can't judge what the chick is feeling... basically that is... pro, con or neutral... you are

The perfect relationship
Back to the Table of Contents
A simple value-eliciting scheme (from an unknown source): 
You: What's important to you in a relationship? A relationship, not qualities in a person... 
Her: Well... x1 
You: Yeah... that's really important to me too. How do you know when you have x1? 
Her: xxx (talking about x1). 
You: I agree... that's a powerful one. Well, what else is important to you in a relationship? 
Her: x2 
You: Yeah... xxx (talking about x2). 
Her: xxx (talking about x2). 
You: Wow...that would be great to be with someone like that. Well, what else is = important to you in a relationship? 
Her: x3 
You: Yeah... xxx (talking about x3). 
Her: xxx (talking about x3). 
Step 2 
You: Of those three values - x1, x2, x3 - which is the most important? Which would you absolutely have to have? 
Her: Well... xn (n being either 1, 2 or 3) 
You: Well... I could see that. Of the other two, which is most important? 
Her: xn (n being either 1, 2 or 3) 
Step 3 
About an hour+ later: 
You: You know...I've been thinking that maybe we've really got the start of something beautiful here. And I think it's something 
based on (x1, x2, and x3 in order of her preference she provided in step 2).

She will go into a pleasure state, at the peak touch her and say: 
You: Can you FEEL THAT would be a really wonderful thing to experience?

Delivering patterns - general rules
Back to the Table of Contents
Being vague. It is important to be as vague as possible in your patterns. For one thing, vagueness for a woman doesn't sound 
incoherent or obscure like it does to the rational and matter-of-fact mind of a man. For a girl, vague equals romantic, thrilling, 
mysterious and intriguing. For another thing, being vague in your patterns lets her more easily link the feelings you describe with 
her own experiences or dreams. The more vague, the better! 
Doesn't patterning sound unnatural? (Ross Jeffries:) "When you learn how to do Speed Seduction according to that, it ceases to 
be about mind-fucking and ramming memorised patterns into a (hopefully:) co-operative subject, and becomes a mutual 
exploration of how you think and how she thinks about certain topics, that naturally would lend themselves to pattern type talk 
even if you didn't know a thing about Speed Seduction! Using the pattern language, therefore, in this context is utterly natural, 
incredibly powerful, and allows you to actually learn something about the woman on a very deep level while you are creating 
incredible connections, sexual feelings, etc. etc." 
Once more, the patterns here are only examples. Ross Jeffries: "The patterns are examples, NOT rules. Many students think 
that unless they present the patterns to women, word for word, that they won't work or get results. THIS IS JUST 100% FALSE! 
The patterns are only examples... very GOOD examples... of the kinds of communication that turn women on. But they aren't 
meant to be rigidly or exclusively followed. Learn from them HOW they work, and you'll be able to eventually create your own 
patterns." 
The Stages of Learning Patterns as stated by Ross Jeffries:
"I would say students go through three stages of Speed Seduction Mastery.
G     Stage One: memorising and using memorised patterns, word for word.
G     Stage Two: learning to use themes that incorporate pieces of the pattern language.
G     Stage Three: learning to use themes that have deep personal meaning for the student as well as being intriguing to women 
and allowing the student to use pieces of the pattern language." 
Can I talk freely or will she interrupt me? Ross Jeffries: "There are two classes of women who respond to patterns; those who 
want to be overwhelmed, and those who want it to be their own experience. The women in the first category will just sit and let 
you run patterns without interrupting; the second category will interrupt by talking. That's ok...let them talk... because they will 
give you their personal trance words which you use back with them when you continue with the patterns! Girls in the second 
category are actually more entertaining and fun!" 
The time delay. Ross Jeffries: "Some women, for whatever reason, have a "time delay" effect; the patterns might not appear to 
work, but an hour or 3 days or even 3 months later, out of the blue they want to bang you. This "time delay" can be an x-factor 
that can make responses seem a bit more unpredictable." 
Update. (Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...":) "If she's still not responsive maybe she's never experienced such feelings 
in the past and is having a hard time keeping up. Slow down and talk as though you are trying to understand as well from the 
experience of your friend. It will be easier for her to imagine all the feelings you are describing if there is no pressure for her to 
readily understand them. Give her the time she needs to absorb everything. And sometimes it takes a while before she'll absorb 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/deliverpatterns_rule.htm (1 of 3) [8/3/2002 9:34:04 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
everything. Believe me, that does happen. 
For example, there was this girl I thought was unresponsive, yet a few days after we had a deep conversation about love and 
feelings she came up to me and acted as though she was truly in love, picking up that same conversation after I almost forgot what 
we were talking about in the first place." 
Combine feelings with body sensations. Ross Jeffries: "As far as possible, layer in body sensations along with your connection 
patterns! When you combine body sensations along with emotional connections, either at the same time or rapidly in sequence, 
the effect is practically irresistible and the power isn't additive...it's exponential!" 
Fear?? No. FUN!! Ross Jeffries: "If you want to be hilariously successful with Speed Seduction, then you must realise that the 
patterns aren't about begging. They aren't even really about tricking or misleading. No, sir, the patterns are about being able to 
create such incredible states of pleasure and fun and highs for her that no one else can, such that she really WANTS to give you 
her sexual goodies. They're about creating states for her that no one else can. Viewed like this, that incredible babe you want to 
bang isn't someone you need to fear. She's someone who's about to receive an incredible gift from you, a gift she might continue 
to receive IF she's smart enough and hot enough and sexy enough to give you what it takes to keep YOU coming back for more. 
You see, it sure makes a damn big difference when you can look at a honey-pie and honestly think to yourself, "How good can 
this woman stand to feel? Let's go have fun and find out!" 
Speaking of fun, another big part of being in the right frame of mind to make SS work is refusing to take it seriously. By that, I 
mean you take the attitude that you are experimenting, having fun, and if what you try doesn't work, you've simply polished your 
skills and learned something new." 
For more specifics about patterns (using visual, auditory or kinaesthetic language for girls with visual, auditory or kinaesthetic 
imaginations accordingly; running at least three different patterns in a row for maximum effectiveness etc.) turn to 
www.seduction.com and see the newsletters. 
Update. Adapted from Ross Jeffries' public seminar tanscript. 
The right attitude. Ross Jeffries: "You see, challenge is where the fun is. If it's not easy, life is not meant to be easy, but life was 
meant to be fun. If you're not going to have fun in the process, then what's the point. And also this is a very sexy attitude. A guy 
who is not put off but is also not hungry, and is having fun in the process of courtship, a woman is attracted to that. A man who'll 
playfully court her without being pushy, a man who is persistent, but at the same time is not pushy or needy but is playful about it. 
[The attitude is:] "Eventually you're going to come around and see what a great deal it is and in the mean time I'll play and have 
fun with you". That's very sexy. You know, I'm telling you something, you can look like a freaking pig and many of my students 
do and still it doesn't make any difference because it's a very rare attitude. It's a very rare approach. You become one man in a 
million." 
See and observe her response. Ross Jeffries: "Ok, we'll talk about the skills. Let's talk about the skills you need to make this 
work. The first skill you need is the ability to observe and to see what response you are getting. Shall I repeat that? The ability to 
observe and see what response that you're getting. In order to do that, you have to be doing what? Louder, I can't hear you. To do 
that you can't be in your head worrying is this working, oh, oh, does she like me, what if I blow it, you have to turn all that crap 
off. Flip that switch to off, pull the plug on that. You have to be totally focused on what response you're getting. Step out of your 
own way and turn all that crap off and just focus in on the response you're getting." 
Be flexible yet persistent. Ross Jeffries: "Ok. Skill No. 2. The flexibility to change to something else if you aren't getting the 
response you want. If you try "have you ever", let's take that one. "Have you ever felt the sense of incredible connection…?", yet 
then you get "no". Instead of giving up you can go "Well have you ever felt really attracted to someone…?". Keep going until you 
get that response. Do you understand. Keep going until you get the response because eventually you will. Or step back and shift to 
something else. Does this make sense? I know, stop a minute, close your eyes. Everyone has some, when I say close your eyes, I 
want the lids down. Anyone who's lids do not close will find their sexual future shrinking away, rapidly, rapidly. Some of us don't 
have long to wait. I want you to think of some situation where you have alot of flexibility where something gets thrown in your 
path, you shift around and you keep going. I don't care what context it is. And as you think of that thing I want you to raise your 
hand in the air, raise your hand in the air, do it and make a fist, raise your arm all the way up in the air, make a fist and as you 
bring that hand down I want you to increase that feeling of utter flexibility and ferociousness that you go for what you want and 
keep going. And do it again. Think of that thing again, raise your hand in the air and as you do that, think to yourself, yes, don't 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/deliverpatterns_rule.htm (2 of 3) [8/3/2002 9:34:04 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
say it but think to yourself. And remember that feeling of being flexible and you go to the next thing. Ok, one more time. And this 
time in your mind's eye, I want you to see some woman that you would really like to seduce and see her not responding the way 
you'd like to. As you put your hand down, notice how you can increase that feeling, hey, I'm going to try something else and keep 
going. Nothing is going to stop me. Do you get that? Alright. Open your eyes and look at me." 
Be patient and learn from trial and error. Ross Jeffries: "Ability No 3 is the ability to be patient and learn from trial and error. I 
know you all admire me and you're not worthy and all that other shit but guess what. I make mistakes with this. But I don't want 
to think of making mistakes, I am learning. I occasionally do things, guess what, they don't work the way I've planned. Guess 
what? I get excited. Kent and Mark here had lunch with me and the first thing I asked them was what have you done that doesn't 
work? Tell me about what you've done where it didn't work. Did I not say that? Because that's where I get excited. That tells me 
I'm about to step into a new level of power. If something isn't working, congratulate yourself because you're about to find out 
what does work. You're about to learn something new. Without that mind set, you will be at best mediocre with this material. 
With this mind set no matter what blocks you may start out with, you will leave them behind quickly and go wherever you want to 
with the material. But if nothing else, if all you do is really begin to live the attitude that there are no failures, there's only 
learnings, you will be ahead 99% of the people in society." 
Be able to move from one pattern to the next. Ross Jeffries: "Ability No. 4. Ability to move from one pattern to the next. I will 
go over some transitional phrases that will allow you to move from any pattern to any other pattern. Even if, it makes it logically 
seem, it's nothing more fun to me than making it seem like my ideas are logically connected when there's no logical connection at 
all. I'm just connecting them so I can ram patterns in. Ok. And there's certain phrases "now here's another thing". Or "here's 
something else that is interesting". It doesn't have to be any logical connection to be any ideas at all."

Delivering patterns - tonality
Back to the Table of Contents
The way you deliver the patterns determines the difference between making her feel wonderful deep inside or you sounding like a 
phoney or a pathetic clown reciting some weird-sounding monologue or script. 
Presenting her with the text accomplishes you nothing, the words itself will not make her feel anything. You have to be the text 
you deliver, you have to feel it with her, be with her every step of the way… until the final eruption:) (Yes, women have been 
reported to have orgasms simply by listening to patterns being delivered the right way:). So memorising the patterns presented in 
this guide does nothing for you, unless you really live out and not simply recite every word to her. 
The patterns that you can find on www.seduction.com or in this guide are mere examples of what pattern-talk is like, they are not 
spells that make magic things happen just because they are mumbled out loud. You can certainly start by memorising some 
patterns, but you will start having real success only when you'll be able to make up a pattern on the fly about anything, that is 
exciting and close to heart for that one specific girl you are talking to. It helps if you have a soft, low, mesmerising and a slightly 
hypnotic voice, and if you don't… try to modulate your voice to become as such while delivering your patterns:) 
(ASF:) "Using a low, seductive voice may seem unnatural at first, but you must practice. Try tape recording your own voice so 
you get an idea of how you sound in general. Then tape yourself reciting a scripted pattern. You'll hear how stilted and unnatural 
it sounds. Now tape yourself while improvising that same pattern, but this time work on making how you say the words sound 
soothing and, well, seductive. Don't worry about screwing up the word order, just concentrate on HOW YOU SAY IT. Also - 
pause mid-sentence to create a sense of anticipation and mystery." 
Update. Adapted from Ross Jeffries' public seminar tanscript no 1: 
Ross: Some of you, your tonality, up until tonight sucked. It just sucks. You need to practice. You've got to make a commitment 
to practice these skills. How many people here walk? How many people here talk? How many people here can stand up? How 
many people here are toilet trained? Keep your hand down, Bruce. Just teasing, ok. Do you think those are all things that you 
acquired immediately? Did you pop out of the womb being able to do it? You had to practice. You must practice these skills on a 
consistent basis. I don't know why I have to continue to hammer on this point before you get it and incorporate it. So let's work on 
controlling tonality, let's put your notes down. I dont want to see anyone writing or holding notes, anyone with a pen in their hand 
will find their gentile is shrinking. And some of you have no time to waste. How many of you know what the vowels are? What 
are the vowels? 
Audience: A,E,I,O,U 
Ross: Wrong, here are the vowels. AAAA, EEEE, IIII, OOOO, UUUU. Those are the vowels. So we're going to do an exercise. 
Put one hand on your chest so you can feel the residence of your voice, take a deep breath, put your head back and say with me. 
AAAA, EEEE, IIII, OOOO, UUUU. Welcome to the five hour orgasm. Ok. When you speak to a woman, you should be speaking 
such that your voice resinates. When you practice these patterns out loud, and you must practice every pattern OUT LOUD. Not 
in your head. Out loud, because you're speaking these out loud. So, we must learn to control our tonality. Ok, let's try another 
exercise. Let's pick a neutral word like watermelon. Ok. Let's all just say watermelon. 
Audience: Watermelon

Ross: Try it one more time 
Audience: Watermelon 
Ross: Ok, now. I want you to remember a time when you were angry, really pissed off and say watermelon as if you were 
expressing that angry feeling. Ready? 
Audience: Watermelon 
Ross: Again 
Audience: Watermelon 
Ross: Alright, can you remember a time when you were curious? I want you to say watermelon with a tonality of curiousity. 
Ready? 
Audience: Watermelon 
Ross: Watermelon, and now seductive and sexy. Say watermelon. Let's start with this row, ok guys. Let's hear you do your 
watermelon seductive and sexy, are you ready? 
Audience: Watermelon 
Audience: Laughs 
Ross: Do you see what I mean? Look, ok, let's hear you say the words, seduce me, let's hear you say seduce me. 
Audience: Seduce me 
Ross: Louder, put your hand on your chest, get the resident, no these guys only, put your head back, take a deep breath and go, 
seduce me, make it resinate. Say it out loud. 
Audience: Seduce me 
Ross: Better, a little louder. This is not observant. Do it. Seduce me, better, ok, now do watermelon. 
Audience: Watermelon 
Ross: Suck it in like this and go watermelon. 
Audience: Watermelon 
Ross: He's got it. Nicky, come on in and have a seat. Ok, do you guys want to try it? Let's hear it. Let's hear the sexiest 
watermelon in the world. Are we ready? 
Audience and Ross: Watermelon 
Ross: That's good. He's got it, go ahead, one more time. 
Audience: Watermelon 
Ross: Very good. Ok, all together, ready. 1, 2, 3, 
Audience and Ross: Watermelon 
Ross: If you guys need extra help on doing this you have my permission to call two 900 numbers. I'm serious. Take them and 
listen to how these women speak. Ok, if necessary, call a gay 900 number. 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/deliverpatterns_tone.htm (2 of 3) [8/3/2002 9:34:06 PM]

http://tranceboy.fws1.com/deliverpatterns_tone.htm
Audience: Laughs 
Ross: I'm serious, I'm serious and listen to how they speak. Here's a good way to make sure you say it right, get the feeling for 
yourself right here. And then as you're speaking to the woman, the feeling that you want her to feel will guide your tonality. Do 
you get that? So imagine the feeling that you want to feel right here and then allow that feeling to guide your voice. So as the 
warmth of that voice just wraps itself around you like a pair of legs around your neck, you'll know, really know, on the inside, just 
exactly what's happening, you know. You must learn to control your tonality. I can't emphasize this enough. It is the single biggest 
stumbling block. Some other ways to learn to control your tonality. Get a dictionary. Pick out words at random and experiment 
saying those words with the right tonality. Pick out loaded words like troop, love, seduction, connection. Write these words down. 
Troop, love, seduction, connection, desire, lust, absolutely fascinated. Ok. And work on saying these in the right tonality. I just 
cannot emphasize this enough. Trying to learn this without getting master of your tonalities is like trying to drive your car without 
gasoline. It's just not going to work.

Submodalities
Back to the Table of Contents
Adapted from Ross Jeffries' public seminar tanscript. 
Ross Jeffries: "How many people know what submodalities are? The basic idea behind submodalities, is that people have 
locations for their internal mental imagery. That's when people make images on the inside of their mind, subjectively speaking, 
those images are located in different places. Let me give you an example. I'll give you an example. Come here, come on up here. 
Come up. What's your name?" 
Audience: "Rod" 
Ross: "Have a seat here. Let me show you what I mean. Can you stop and think about someone who you really, really like. Is 
there someone that you really like alot?" 
Rod: "Yes I can" 
Ross: "As you think about that person and you see their image in your mind don't you?" 
Rod: "Yes" 
Ross: "Imagine your mind is a movie screen. And if you were to take your finger and point to where on the movie screen you see 
their image where might you point right now. Right there. Very nice. Now can you think of someone who you can't stand at all? I 
mean, if you saw a car coming at this person, you might go "hey!" but you wouldn't be in too big of a hurry to get them out of the 
way. Where you see the picture? Where? And where is the picture of the person that you really like? Now take this picture of the 
person who you don't like much and try to move it over here and see what happens. Looks like it doesn't want to stay there, does 
it?" 
Rod: "It's heavy" 
Ross: "By the way, notice how the more you listen to me the more my picture goes right here. And the bigger and brighter it gets. 
And you just lock it there. Keep it there. That's a neat thing. The number one submodality is location, where people put their 
pictures. There's alot of other ones but for our purpose the one that we are going to be using is location. Yes, question." 
Audience: "In many of the experiments that I've gone through with, I find that alot of the pictures are very spacial. They don't 
have a position, I can't put them in a position." 
Ross: "Then what you do is suggest one. If they don't have one, suggest it. See, notice what it's like if that picture just pops itself 
out of your head and locks in right in front of your face. If they don't have one, suggest it. So you can put yourself there." 
An exercise of removing doubts and hesitation via the use of submodalities 
Ross Jeffries: "So here's the exercise that we're going to do. Close your eyes, this means eyes close. Close your eyes. What I want 
you to do is, I want you to think about something that you use to want to be when you were a little kid. But then as you grew up 
you just forgot all about it. So think of that thing that you used to want to be when you were a little kid and then maybe you just 
forgot all about it. If some of you haven't done that, then think of something you use to do when you were a kid but you no longer

do. I prefer you pick something you used to want to do as a kid but then you have forgotten about it. Ok, and take a minute to do 
that. And this is going to become a very important tool so I want you to notice as you think about this where in your mental movie 
screen you see that picture. And actually take your finger, I want to see everyone doing this, and take your finger and point to 
where you seem to see that picture. And notice that location and draw a white square there. But make it red. Make it a red square 
if you can do that. If you can see the color red, ok. Now, I want you to think, do you believe the sun is going to come up 
tomorrow? Put your hand down, just remember that location, do you believe that the sun is going to come up tomorrow, yes or 
not?" 
Audience: "Yes" 
Ross: "As you are believing that I want you to make a picture of that in your mind, of your belief that the sun will come up 
tomorrow. No it's not a belief, it's a fact. Ok, your belief that the sun will come up tomorrow. You got it. And point to where you 
see that. Point to where you see that and draw a square around that one but make it green. Make it a green square. Alright, if 
you're having trouble with the color, don't worry about it. Just make it whatever color you want. Alright, now here's what I want 
you to do. I want you to see the image of yourself that doesn't believe that you can do this [speed seduciton] stuff. I know some of 
you have doubts, now is the time to let any doubt you want come into your mind. Your doubts that you can do this material, you 
know, you feel that you are going to get caught, your doubts that I'm not the best teacher in the world, whatever your doubts are 
that you are going to get rid of them completely, just whatever they are, I'm going to get caught, I'm not confident enough, women 
don't like me, whatever it is, right, I want you to allow an image or images that represent those thoughts to pop into your mind. 
And very quickly stick those into the red square. Shove those images and pictures right into the red square and lock it in there. 
And some of you may be thinking but I don't want to let the thoughts go. But notice this, the more you think that the more it 
pushes them away anyway. So they have no choice. Now I want you to create a new self image. I want you to see the you that has 
the spirit that I've been putting into, the idea, that hey, challenge is fun. If I don't get it the first time I'll keep tap dancing around 
this person until I get it. I want you to hear me, going "go for it fuckweed!". In the back of your head." 
Audience: "Laughs" 
Ross: "Just do it. I'm serious. I want you to hear my voice in the back of your head saying "go for it fuckweed". Don't be a dick, 
go for it. I want you to do that in the back of your head. Ok, I want you to see that image of you that sort of has my ideas in your 
head, the ideas of being flexible and ferocious and having fun with it. Ok. Now you want to check push limits and see how blatant 
you can be, try to get caught with this. Ok. Notice as that image of yourself goes into the green square. And fill the green square 
up with that image. And notice that the bigger and brighter that green square image gets, the smaller and darker the red square 
image gets. To the point where the red square just disappears completely. And lock in that image. And now that you see that 
image of yourself in that green square, here's what I want you to do as the next step. Keep your eyes closed, I know you love to 
look at me dear but keep your eyes closed. Just look at me on the inside, deep inside your mind. Aren't you. Ok, here's what I want 
you to do, look, see that image of you in the green square, I want you to make it forty feet tall. And what I want you to do, you 
make it forty feet tall, is turn it around so you only see it from behind. So you'll see the back of yourself. And as you allow that to 
continue, raise it up above your head, and when I snap my fingers, drop it down on top of your so you'll look into those forty foot 
tall eyes. Are you ready? (Ross snaps his fingers) Do it. And now looking out through those forty foot tall eyes add in a few 
snarls. A voice in your head that says your ass is mine. I want you to imagine there's a woman in front of you. And now what I 
want you to do is just zoom on the part of that person that you find the most attractive. Just zoom in on it. Zoom in on it, ok and 
over her shoulder I want you to see that forty foot tall you again. In fact, I want you to see an entire army of forty foot tall yous 
lined up. Now look at and zoom on the body part, hear that voice that goes (snarl) you know that sexy tonality, that ooh ahh. And 
over her other shoulder I want you to see you and her getting it on. And now notice how any attempt of hesitation just flies into 
that red square and shrinks away and smalls itself. To the point where you can't even imagine ever trying to be that way, it just 
gets wiped out completely. As if a giant hand were wiping out that tiny little red square of doubt. The hand attached to the body 
that has the voice that says "do it fuckface". "Do it now!". Now stop a minute and try to doubt, try in vain to doubt your ability to 
master these skills and use them. Tell me what happens. What happens when you try and doubt. It's unnatural, that's right. That's 
right. Good, I want you to carry that with you."

Read romance novels to enrich your patterning language
Back to the Table of Contents
One of the most inexplicable things about women than their hunger for romance novels. What sane person would waste his/her 
time reading such garbage? Laughable plots, boring dialogue etc - well time to reassess your position:) Or at least - see it as 
"useful" garbage:) 
When you read patterns for the first time you probably thought the very same thing - "Holy shit what garbage?! I can't believe 
this?! Is there actually a female there on this planet that would fall for crap like that??" Well women eat romance novels up like 
candy just like they fall for patterns for actually, the two have very much in common. Mark Cunningham, an accomplished 
student of Ross Jeffries': "I admit these books are difficult, because you're reading through them and you're going, "What the fuck 
are they talking about?". But if you lift some of the ideas and the language from them and say them in a slow, relaxed and 
powerful manner, women melt. They've finally found a man who knows how to communicate with them in a meaningful way." 
Guys, time to head for the library / book-store… and don't forget to approach some romance hungry HB's while you're there, and 
maybe ask for some pointers…:) 
A list of recommended romance novels for this specific purpose: (any suggestions?).

Common misconceptions and problems with patterning
Back to the Table of Contents
An article by Ross Jeffries explaining the most important misconceptions and problems people have with patterning. Ross 
Jeffries, ASF: 
"The following understandings represent ways to clear up the most common misconceptions and problems that students I have 
talked with typically encounter. 
Understanding #1: The Patterns Are Only Examples! 
As Major Mark and I have said over and over again in seminars, the patterns sure are wonderful. Whether it's the Blammo, the 
Blow Job, the tried and true "Discovery Channel" or any one of so many patterns now in the Speed Seduction Þ material, it is 
important to realize they are only examples. They are examples of the kinds of communication that open and stimulate a woman 
to give her the deep emotional and imaginative experiences that she longs for. 
Can the patterns, used word for word as we teach them, work for you? Of course! That's what they are designed to do! 
But it is equally important to use the patterns as a teaching tool for yourself. To give yourself opportunities to learn about the 
types of communications that really stimulate women and give them what they really long for. 
Think of the patterns as training wheels; when you first learned to ride a bicycle more than likely you did it with FOUR wheels, 
and NOT two. Once you learned the basics of balance and forward momentum; once you got "the feel" of things, the training 
wheels were removed and perhaps after a few falls, off you went! 
Same with the patterns you'll find in the courses, videos, workbooks and seminars. They are as much tools to train yourself as they 
are methods to open and stimulate women! 
Therefore, as you grow in the use of the materials, you will begin to find you adapt bits and pieces of the patterns in different 
order and in different ways to fit the individual situation and unique women you are encountering! In fact, you may well begin to 
create your own! That is a sign you are really at a level of great mastery! 
Understanding #2: Getting "Caught" Is Bullshit! 
One of the more common challenges new students bring up is the fear of "getting caught". Some students believe that using 
patterns is somehow like committing some kind of minor crime, like picking a girl's pocket or stealing her purse. 
Remember, you can only fear "getting caught" if you view what you are doing as something wrongful or damaging. 
What you need to understand is this: using patterns is not taking something away from her. You aren't stealing her wristwatch; 
you are giving her something wonderful. A chance to experience feelings and emotions and states of mind/body that very, VERY 
few people can ever give. 
You need to believe that what you are offering to give has value, even if at first you aren't the smoothest in the delivery of it. 
Look at it like this; if she had polio and YOU had the vaccine, would you feel nervous, guilty or shameful about telling her, 
"Hey?c'mere?.you really need what I have?".

Well, so many women, no matter how beautiful, are suffering from a disease far worse than polio. It's the disease of the 
expected?the hum-drum?the "used to that already". And you, my friend with the patterns and the understanding of women they 
give, are the cure for that and perhaps the only cure she will ever find. 
Understanding #3: Gifts, NOT Apologies! 
Another incorrect way to view patterns that you are now correcting is that somehow, they are apologies. Ways to make up for 
something that you are lacking. Ways of saying, "I'm sorry I don't have the looks or the body or the youth or the money that you 
want, but won't you please accept these pretty words, oh lovely Princess who I don't deserve to be with?" 
Well, with THAT kind of attitude, which not only doesn't work but is also inaccurate, NO fancy words will work for you. 
Listen?hear?get this understanding: the patterns are NOT ways of making up for what you lack. They are ways of offering women 
what it is THEY truly long for; the deep, powerful, emotional and imaginative experiences that every woman, deep in the core of 
her being, really looks and longs for. 
It is not that you are making up for lack of looks, youth, money, status, etc. It is that these things may be what women are used to 
wanting, but are NOT what would really deeply fulfill them. The kinds of communications the patterns offer ARE. What other 
guys offer is counterfeit; "funny money" that women are used to accepting, because it's mostly the only thing in circulation. Speed 
Seduction gives you the genuine article; the pure gold "coin of the realm" instantly recognizable in women's souls and hearts as 
what they've always truly been looking for. 
Understanding #4: Feelings Before Words! 
So many students have told me: "Ross, the patterns seem so foreign to me. They just don't seem like they are me." 
What's usually going on for these beginners is that the patterns are descriptions of experiences they themselves have never 
imagined or had. So naturally, they just seem like they are reciting empty words with NO meaning. These poor guys are so 
focused on memorizing the words, they haven't put any focus into getting some of the feelings. 
You see, if you have never had a "peak experience" and haven't even imagined having one, it is pretty hard to sound convincing or 
to be captivating talking about it. It's just empty words with nothing to back it up. Sort of like the Japanese singing duo from the 
70's, "Pink Lady". These two lovely Japanese girls understood not ONE word of English. But they were a big hit on the talk show 
circuit, singing English songs which they memorized purely by sound, the joke being how they obviously did not understand one 
single syllable of what they were singing! 
The solution here, if this is your problem, is to focus, in the beginning, NOT on memorization, but on imagining for yourself the 
experiences the patterns describe. Imagine for yourself what it would be like to feel an incredible connection, a peak experience, 
the excitement and body sensations of "parts" of the Blow Job pattern, etc. etc. 
As you read through and listen to patterns, imagine having the experience for yourself, and get at least some of the feelings you 
want to convey to the women you wish to seduce. Notice I said "some" of the feeling; if you get all of the feelings as intensely as 
you wish her to feel them, no one will have their hands on the wheel! Just get a bit of the feeling; enough to let that feeling guide 
the expression of your words. 
In this way, the patterns serve to expand who you are. To give you experiences and to cause you to take notice of experiences that 
before might have gone [Image] completely by. As you expand who you are and how you experience your world, the bonus is you 
not only become better at patterns, but a more rounded and balanced human being who will naturally be more appealing to women 
by virtue of who you are and what you experience as well as by the words you know to say! Your success with the material will 
grow as you grow as a man. 
Remember this very important principle: In life, you will not get what you want. You will not get what you "deserve". You will 
only get what the energies you can create can connect with. 
Therefore, learn to create new and different energies for yourself by the experiences the patterns can give to you. 
Understanding #5: The Importance Of Themes 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/misconcept.htm (2 of 5) [8/3/2002 9:34:14 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
If you want to learn to naturally flow from one pattern to the next it is important to understand and use themes. 
Themes are simply overall ideas that tie patterns together. 
Consider the metaphor of a strand of pearls. The theme is the string that holds together the pearls, which are the patterns. 
There are many, many themes which are likely to lead to a successful seduction. Among my favorites are: 
*Different places in the mind 
*What we are used to wanting; what we THINK we want versus what would truly deeply fulfill us. 
*Permission to explore 
*Connections(with each other, with those deeper places in the mind, with our dreams, hopes, goals, wishes) 
*Indulgence 
As you go through the patterns in the course, notice how you can tie them together under one or more of these themes. 
One way to look for a theme is to examine a group of ideas or things and see what they overall have in common. For example, in 
the following list: 
* Disneyland 
* Magic Mountain 
* Sea World 
* Six Flags 
What are they all examples of? What do they all have in common? Yes, they are all places for fun, rides, attractions, crowds. 
Those are all elements they share. But overall, they all belong to the category of things called amusement parks. 
So when you want to link one pattern with any other, find some overall experience or thing of which they are all examples. 
Understanding #6: The Two Ways In Which Patterns Work 
20% of the time when you use patterns, a woman will silently sit there, follow along quietly, go exactly into the states and 
experiences you describe and "poof"; you get banged! 
80% of the time, however, the patterns work in a more interesting way. 
Consider the metaphor of a pearl, once again. How are pearls made? Are they inserted directly into the oyster? 
No; what happens is that a grain of sand gets into the oyster and acts as an irritant. The oyster forms the pearl around the grain of 
sand as a result of the stimulation caused by the little bit of foreign matter. 
In the same way, with brighter, more intelligent and ultimately more suggestible and fun women, the patterns act to stimulate and 
awaken the deeper structures in her mind that have been laying dormant, asleep and hibernating, or that have been repressed for 
personal or social reasons. Thus the patterns stir her slumbering structures for fantasy, desire, indulgence, surrender, wild 
abandon, etc. 
What happens when a woman suddenly feels these things awakening? Why, my good man, she does what women so often love to 
do. She TALKS! 
Now, her talking is a good thing. For she is not only giving you solid information; accurate descriptions of her own internal 
models and maps for what the ideal fantasies, dreams, indulgences and surrendering should be like, but by talking she revivifies 
and re-awakens all these slumbering things. 
So when she talks, LISTEN. Anchor her deeper responses with a touch or a glance or a sound or preferably all three at the same 
time and FEED back her own "personal trance words" into the standard patterns you have memorized! When you use HER own 
words, remember she not only doesn't resist, but these words act as signals to further awaken these deeper structures in her mind. 
You can then link these structures to you and amplify these things and show her how to experience them more vividly, profoundly 
and enjoyably then she ever has before! That is the key to seduction genius and power!

Understanding #7: How To Practice Pattern Flow 
Ideally, you want to be able to flow from any one pattern to any other pattern. Just as in a boxing match, you want to be able to 
throw combinations instead of one punch every round, so too once you have a woman going with Speed Seduction you do NOT 
want to stop until you get your outcum? er? ah? OUTCOME. 
Therefore, practicing pattern flow is vital! 
One good way is to take the last sentence of any one pattern. Then come up with a linking or transitional phrase like, "It's just 
like" or "Another thing about that is this" and then the first sentence of the next pattern you want to use. Write these out in long 
hand and then, most vitally important practice saying these in sequence, out loud, so you know you can transition when you need 
to. 
Do bear in mind that OUT LOUD practice, in the right state, with the right tonality and tempo is VITAL! The patterns are meant 
to be spoken, not written, so merely writing them is NOT sufficient practice! 
Understanding #8: Do NOT Lust For Results! 
Speed Seduction is not just about how you speak; it is a different way of perceiving the world. As such, it takes time to approach 
mastery. That means the key is to immerse yourself in these learnings. Practice all the time, every day, on as many people as you 
can. If you reserve your practice ONLY for beautiful women, you make beautiful women the cause of your skill, and THAT is a 
fatal error! 
No, I'm not suggestion you get some disgusting ugly monster hot and horny. I am suggesting that using your skills to make 
virtually everyone you come in contact with feel much better than before they met you IS a good thing to aim at! 
Above all, be patient with yourself. Learning takes place on many levels, and it can take some time, some stumbling and some 
plain fucking it up to get good. 
But so what? You learned to walk and learned to read and write and that took plenty of trial and error. We are talking about a 
lifetime of results and enjoyment here! 
Now, every once in a while, a student will tell me he has memorized every single pattern but hasn't tried a single one as much as 
once in the real world! And I must inform you if you are potentially such a person that you don't really understand Speed 
Seduction until you've gone out and done it! 
If you aren't willing to stumble a little bit?..to undergo SOME discomfort, however slight, to get what you want in life, then how 
will ANY woman with ANY judgement at all find you attractive no matter WHAT words you say? If you care so little for your 
own life and happiness that you won't take a SINGLE step to improve your lot, then nothing I can teach you to SAY will help you 
one bit. NO woman would find such a man attractive. 
So get up off your lazy, self-pitying, sorry ass, IF this describes you, and make a vow to work at making the material work. If you 
want everything handed to you on a platter, you are going to wait forever and get nowhere! USE THE ENCLOSED 
MATERIALS, GROW UP, and be willing to be an adult who will fight for what he wants instead of a spoiled child who waits for 
Mommy or Daddy to give it to him without cost! We've blazed a trail and smoothed the path and lit it up and marked it clearly; if 
there is an occasional pebble you have to step on, so fucking what! Get your ass moving!" 
Update. The various levels of NLS or Neuro Linguistic Seduction (which is what patterning seems to be called on Mindlist). By 
Zachary D. Marcy, Mindlist: 
"I have been practicing NLP for about 3 years now. I have just stepped into my own since being on this list and being a student of 
Kenrick Cleveland. In this time period I have ran into an abundance of guys that are at different skill levels and stages in their 
lives with NLS. I wrote down several of them (including the ones I have experienced which seems to be all but a few). See if you 
can identify yourself with any or several of these stages and also write down what you think you can do to improve on them. I will 
try to give an example of each as I type them, but I don't want to be here all night so I may just ask you to ... USE YOUR MIND... 
to REALIZE... which stage I am refering too. Now, without furthur ado:

G     Excited about NLS but Lost - Remember when you first saw all the advertising about SS and NLS? How-open eyed you 
were and how all of your ideas for what you could do with this stuff ran wild. 
G     Skeptical about NLS but Lost - Remember after you read your first pattern and wondered "how in the HELL could I start 
to talk to a woman like this?" 
G     Diligent about NLS but Lost - You can't figure out why you keep doing these exercises about mirroring and matching 
etc... but you do... This is a GOOD stage, it makes the success worth it! 
G     Computer Success but Lost IRL (in real life) - I didn't go through this much. Alex Akselrod knows about this stage...ask 
him about it. 
G     Telephone and computer success but lost IRL - I did go through a success on telepersonals stage where I was too 
chicken shit to take in patterns in real life. 
G     Stuck on one line and one pattern (not flexible) - this has a ton to do with memorizing patterns! 
G     Some Success but not repeatable - You have some how managed to get a few success' using a few ideas and patterns and 
just haven't been able to repeat them. This usually comes when you are being selective and you aren't that flexible yet. 
G     Some Success and ONLY repeatable with some types of women - most of the time the success was dumb luck. I use to 
have this problem a bit too. I managed to get a few patterns and ideas that worked well with certain types of women and I 
just used those and that was it. This was the second stage I expereinced with NLS. The first was no 1 and I next went to 
this stage. It was hard for me too. I ran into a rut where I didn't meet women that fit this type that I had originally set in my 
mind and I almost threw NLS out of the door. I am glad I was persistent with it! 
G     Playing the odds game - you approach 10 women and get one. I was always too picky from the start to do this. Now, 
understand, this is GREAT practice. 
G     Snagging Many (approaching about a 60-70% success rate) - remember SUCCESS is defined by YOUR desired outcome! 
Not my definition of success! 
G     Doing Great and Being Picky (going for types) - THIS is where was about 3 months ago. I liked this stage in my NLS 
career! 
G     Just Flat out picky and not using NLS on any women unless they fit your criteria - here is where I am currently at. It's 
odd, I figured I would like this stage! I really don't ... I am going back to being a huge flirt again! 
G     Find and NLS the Girlfriend and yet you cheat on her - This is a saftey girl... you can do this with just dating a girl too. 
Unfortunantly, I went through this phaze a while ago. 
G     Find the GirlFriend type and get her - I belive this is what I am currently searching for... where the hell is she? 
G     Find the ONE to marry - DO WHAT? OK OK... so I have heard several success stories similar to this one. I am young 
and have a full life ahead of me. I am not looking into this... YET. 
G     Using NLS to make your marriage work or make it better - ask someone who knows. 
G     Using NLS to make your relationship better - It worked for me and my ex. It also made me realize who I didn't want to 
be with. 
Realize that these ARE NOT in any order per se. Most of them are just various stages on relatively the same plain. This may give 
you goals to strive for or just idea of where you are currently at. It might give you application that you haven't realized before... 
but you realize your application now."

Discovery Channel pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
You: "You know, I saw the most interesting show on the Discovery Channel last night. They were interviewing people who make 
their living designing attractions for amusement parks like Magic Mountain and Disneyland and Universal Studios. Wouldn't that 
be a cool way to make a living?" 
Her: "Yeah! That sounds so interesting." 
You: "Well, anyway, they were talking about the elements that make up the ideal attraction (sp). They said there are 3 parts to the 
ideal attraction. First, when you EXPERIENCE the ideal attraction, you FEEL A STATE OF HIGH AROUSAL. The ideal 
attraction makes your heart beat faster, and your breathing gets faster and you just FEEL THAT AMAZING RUSH all over." 
Her: "Yeah!" 
You: "And then they said that another part to an ideal attraction is - it's fascinating. You just FEEL SO ENTHRALLED that you 
want to TAKE THIS RIDE (point to your pecker!) multiple times; as soon as you GET OFF you want to GET BACK ON again." 
Her: "Yeah!" 
You: "And they said, finally, the most important element, is a sense of overall safety. That even though the attraction make look a 
little dangerous, you're CERTAIN YOU'RE SAFE... you FEEL SAFE because you realise nothing bad can really happen, so that 
allows you to FEEL TOTALLY FREE to LET GO AND ENJOY THAT GREAT AROUSAL again and again and again. Can you 
(squeeze her hand) feel _that_... is pretty close to the way it is?" 
Her: "Oooh...yeah!!" 
Ok, this pattern has been reported to make women cum, out of the blue, just by reciting it to them:) Usually though, after you're 
done with your description, the girl says with a sly smile "Sounded more like making love:)" Don't be shocked, don't stiffen up - 
for she loved it regardless:) Or rather... exactly because of that:) And if nothing else comes to mind, you can answer with a 
confused look at first and then a "Well... now that you mention it:)". 
Update. You: "When you imagine how much fun it is to ride a roller coaster or any other kind of amusement park ride .. Its like as 
that ride is climbing up and up, you can feel your heart pounding with excitement, you feel you're breathing faster and faster, 
sometimes you're even gasping and panting you feel the blood rushing through every part of your body and as that excitement and 
tension is building and building, you reach the top of the ride and then as it crests, you just release it in a flood of excitement, and 
sometimes you're screaming you're so turned on. 
And you know, afterwards I thought to myself, isn't that the totally accurate description of your ideal attraction to another person. 
You know that kind of wonderful click right there (right in the center of who you are) that just makes you feel totally drawn to 
this person and on one hand you feel totally safe and totally comfortable like you were meant to know them and as if you've 
known them forever."

Stone Necklace pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
By Bishop: 
"Keep in mind, as always, that this is NOT a "magic bullet" so it should be used as part of an overall seduction structure. Also 
keep in mind that I DO NOT say this to a babe word-for-word. I wrote it out long this way because I tend to recall more when I'm 
out sarging, if my patterns were written with a shitload of details. (And also so I knew where I wanted to go with it, and what 
commands I wanted to include.) 
"I've been staring at your necklace, wondering why it reminded me of something, and now I remember what it was. 
I recall a story I had read once, called "The Eros Stone Necklace." It was about a woman who was growning apart from her lover, 
and was losing faith in love. 
One night she was out walking, up in the mountains near her home. As she sat upon some rocks, and was staring up at the stars, 
she made a wish that a man would come into her life, and fill her with the adventure she had been missing. Suddenly, there was a 
flash around her, which at first startled her. But then she began to… FEEL VERY RELAXED. A nice… soothing… comfortable 
feeling filled her body. Then an image flashed into her head. An image of passion so incredible… so fulfilling, that she almost 
thought she were dreaming. At first she tried to deny that she was starting to… FEEL A WARMTH DEEP INSIDE… because she 
was afraid to feel that good. But the more she allowed herself to… FEEL THAT WARMTH INCREASE, the stronger it became, 
and the more she wanted this to continue. Then she started to... HEAR THIS VOICE…inside her mind. And the more she allowed 
herself to... LISTEN TO THIS VOICE… the more it relaxed her, the more it warmed her, the more it caused her to… LISTEN 
INTENTLY TO WHAT'S SAID. The voice began to change, and started to sound like her own voice. And this voice said to her, 
"Focus on what is in front of you, and you will discover that which you desire." Then, POOF, the voice was gone, leaving her 
to… UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SAID. 
She put her hand to her chest, to settle her breathing, and felt something around her neck. She pulled it forward, and saw that 
where there was once nothing, there was now a beautiful necklace, with a (the color of her stone) colored stone. She was of course 
confused at first, but then she recalled the voice that she had heard, and what it had said to her; FOCUS ON THIS (point to self) 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU… AND YOU WILL… FIND WHAT YOU DESIRE. Now, it all becomes clear. She has the 
necklace, and somehow it will give her what she desires. Without even fully understanding what is happening, the decision is 
made to pursue this…to have what is desired deep down inside. She said to herself, "No matter what anyone else says to you, this 
is what you want (point to self) this is what you deserve, and you're going to do it for all your own reasons." 
The next day she went into town to buy some things, and was amazed… by what happened… upon entering the market. 
(Stay quiet and wait for her to say something) 
Upon entering the market, she saw this man (point to self) and felt a tingle, give me your hands (when she gives you her hands do 
this) a tingle like this, and warmth, a very strong warmth, that ran (slowly move finger up arm) all the way… up her body. 
The man's eyes caught her eyes, and they stared for several moments. That warmth deep inside, began to get stronger, and 
stronger, and stronger. And as the man approached her, she started to FEEL DESIRE FORMING deep inside of her… right… 
in… here (touch solar plexus). It was like an energy had formed around them, like a soft… private bubble, surrounding them from

the rest of the world. In this moment only these two people (motion back and forth subtly) existed. 
He smiled, and said not a single word, and instead kissed her lips softly. She closed her eyes and took in the moment (take in a 
breath, then let it out slowly with a slight moan). At last, she had found the man who would make her feel alive again. The man 
pulled back to look into her eyes, and whispered softly, "What can I do, what can I say, to make you mine, if but only for a 
night?" She thought about what it was she wanted, and asked herself, "What do you want deep down inside of you? What is 
missing from your life right now that you want from this man?" And with only a smile, she took his hand, and lead him out of the 
market. 
They talked for hours, sharing insights, and opinions, dreams, and desires. Then they simply fell into each others arms, and made 
love for the night. It was unlike anything she could imagine. He touched her exactly how she wanted to be touched, made love to 
her exactly how she wanted to be made love to. And all of this was the result of a chance encounter, and a magical necklace. As 
they held each other later, he complimented her on her necklace. She revealed to him what had happened the previous night on the 
mountain, and how she came to possess the necklace. He kissed her lips, then said, "Every time you become aware of having this 
necklace, think of me. And every time you touch this necklace, I will feel your touch upon my face, and I will smile." They parted 
the next morning, but made plans to meet again that evening. 
Sadly, she decided not to meet him after all, for she feared that this magical, wonderful, amazing adventure she had shared with 
this man (point to self) would eventually be ruined for one reason or another someday. She instead chose to REMEMBER 
FOREVER that one perfect night, with this one perfect man. She thought of him often, and his image was never far from her 
mind. And ever day she would touch that necklace, and every day she would FEEL AN INCREDIBLE WARMTH for she knew, 
that somewhere, he was smiling.""

The Trust pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): "You want to overcome the common trait of thought that women believe you will dump 
them immediately after the deed is done if they are so easily led into the bedroom. Heres what you can say as a story to place 
calmness and trust into the girl's mind. Make sure you carefully ease this into the conversation during the night. Look for the 
opening to say it. Think of it like a jig-saw puzzle except your trying to fill in another gap. 
"Yeah trust. It's a funny thing. I actually lost some faith in girls a couple of years ago". Now you need to pause here to get her to 
ask why. By doing the pause you achieve a couple of things. The first is that you don't blow your cover about your rehearsed 
story by reeling off a memorised statement. The second is that you may be placing her in the perfect position for your intentions. 
She will hopefully want to prove you wrong and restore your faith in the trust of women. 
"I had a one night stand with a girl and we didn't see each other again for a couple of months". Here you are saying to her that 
one night stands are okay. The way you are saying it in open conversation with this girl will downplay the one night stand black 
cloud that hovers over it in girls minds. 
Then say: "I lost her number so I couldn't catch up with her". You are now telling her that you didn't act like the typical male 
bastard by not ringing her after getting what all males only want. You're saying you would have, if only you hand't lost her 
number. It also says you still want to see a girl after a one night stand and she will think: "If I fuck him tonite he won't just burn 
me like other guys have done to my friends and also to me. This guy is great. I won't have to play the hard to get routine with 
him to keep him interested in me. I can fuck him tonite and he'll still ring me". 
Then you say: "Anyway, what happened was that a very close mate of mine one day just came right out and asked me if I'd slept 
with this girl". You are now putting in her mind that you don't ever discuss women stories even with your close mates. She's 
thinking: "If he doesn't mouth off to his mates he probably doesn't tell anyone what he does". 
Then say: "I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I never tell even my best mates what I do and don't do with girls, so she must 
have been the one to open her mouth". You're now acting shocked and amazed how the info got out because you don't even tell 
your best mates. You have made her believe your story about not telling your mates because it is a close mate who is telling you 
this news and you are just beside yourself as to how he would know what happened. She will be thinking now: "The girl must 
have been the one to tell his friend because who else would have"? 
When you deliver these lines, after a while you will even start to believe them yourself. Try to let yourself get involved in the 
fantasy of your lines to women. When you convey your well timed lines in this manner you will be well on the way to getting the 
woman or women you desire."

The Rose patterns
Back to the Table of Contents
Pattern I 
An excellent pattern by Brother Soul, Mindlist: 
"The basic theory of this pattern is to use it as a method to take the woman into a deep trance (she will actually assist you – isn’t 
that great?!?!) and put your picture in her place where she loves someone and then lock it in as absolutely true. Now, this type of 
pattern will create a real obsession and will lock in her feelings for you. The one problem is that it really shouldn’t be used in most 
contexts unless you are really sure that this is a keeper. So, use of this pattern is very very dangerous. Please use caution because 
you just might have created an obsessive person. This basically creates a strong compulsion via submodality shifts and locks in 
that change. My suggestion is to use this on your girlfriend or wife. 
The setup for this pattern is to engage the woman in conversation. I will assume, for the purposes of this pattern, that you are able 
to get her into fluff talk. During the fluff talk, develop rapport, and ask about how sometimes you have a down day and feel bad. 
Then tell her you learned this great visualization exercise in a relaxation book. Now, women love talking about and doing 
anything related to self-help and improving themselves. Ask her if you could show her this exercise that will allow her to feel 
really great at any time (most woman will agree to this – if she doesn't, well... you're out of luck... and would you want her 
anyway???). 
(Note: First, have her close her eyes and set it up as a visualization exercise to help her feel good... absolutely wonderful, at any 
time she wishes) 
[BEGIN PATTERN] 
You know, I learned this great visualization exercise that really helps you pick yourself up when you aren’t feeling that great. It 
really has helped me just perk myself up during the day and just make me feel wonderful. Would you like me to show it to you, so 
that you too can do this and feel absolutely wonderful? It will only take a minute or two and really will bless you with the things it 
can do for you. 
Her: Oh yes. I would love that. Yada Yada Yada. 
Okay. I would love to share this with you and really contribute to your happiness [notice the set-up for reciprocity]. I invite you to 
visualize a mental screen much like a movie screen, in front of you. As you see this mental screen, allow yourself to see your 
favorite flower. And, as you see this flower, allow the full sensory rich detail of the flower to be on the mental screen. See it in 
vivid color, each detail of the flower springing forth. Now, if I were to ask you which type of flower you are seeing, what would 
you say was the type of the flower? (good way to learn her favorite flower) 
Her: Roses (tulips, carnations, etc.) 
Doesn’t it FEEL WONDERFUL to see the rose in such beautiful detail? As you see that flower, see the beautiful color of the rose. 
Allow the rich texture of it to become alive. While you see this color, hear the rustle of the petals as you see the wind blow 
slightly against the petal. And, reach out and allow the smell to become stronger, richer, and oh so beautiful. You can notice that it 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/p_rose.htm (1 of 3) [8/3/2002 9:34:22 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
makes you FEEL SO RELAXED AND COMFORTABLE. 
Now, as you look at this beautiful rose... if you were to visualize a picture of a family member you love dearly, like say your 
child, parent, or someone special, where would it be on the mental screen. Allow yourself to notice the location of where that 
picture was (notice presupp. here). What would really make that rose wonderful, would be to place that rose in the same location 
as where you saw the picture of the family member. As you now see the picture of the rose in that special place, let each petal of 
the rose represent some aspect of a goal, dream, or wish you want to have in your life. Allow YOUR UNCONSCIOUS mind to 
place those goals, dreams, and wishes in the flower. As you do this, see me in that picture smiling as you hand me that rose to 
hold for you. Allowing you to FEEL WONDERFUL at the knowledge that you can ask for the rose at any moment and I will hand 
it to you and making you FEEL SO WONDERFUL. 
Now as you feel these feelings, see that picture becoming more clear, more focused. The picture is full of rich texture, reach three-
dimensional detail. Allow the smell to grow, smell the sweet scent of the flower. Allow the picture to grow larger, with each 
breath, it grows larger. And as you see it grow, the picture comes closer to you…become more clear. Moving closer to you. See 
the color becoming more vivid, more detailed. And, it becomes more sharp, and becomes more and more like a movie... with 
movement. 
Now, allow YOUR MINE to take this flower within yourself. Sometimes, the conscious mind gets in the way of your growth. 
Allow YOUR UNCONCIOUS mind to find that special place within you. That special place where you hold everything to be 
absolutely true. You know where that special place is, and as you feel and sense that special place, allow the picture of me holding 
that flower to GO DEEP INSIDE within that special place and lock in there. As that picture of me holding the flower locks in, 
hear the clanging sound similar to the slamming of a gate. You know that the picture is now locked into your place of absolute 
truth. 
Now, it might surprise you how your unconscious mind will allow this picture of me holding the flower to pop up during your 
days to remind you of these wonderful feelings and allow you to FEEL SO FABULOUS. And, during your sleep, your 
unconcious mind will allow this to become a dream….helping you to FEEL SO GOOD. 
[END OF PATTERN] 
DISCUSSION 
Now, this pattern does not rely on embedded commands to create a horny state in the woman. But, let me assure you, by the end 
of this pattern, the woman will be so wet for you. The great thing about this pattern is, that it not only creates physical arousal, it 
also creates the "warm fuzzies" that creates rapport and connection with you. Its like a two for one deal. The key to the pattern is 
that it links you to all her hopes, wishes, desires, and dreams (you holding the flower) and places that picture of you (moving 
pictures) in the location where she has pictures of those that she loves. Now the kicker is, that it moves that picture into her place 
of absolute truth to forever lock her love to you. The whole process of asking her to allow you to show this to her is that it really 
takes her (with her own help) into a trance, a highly relaxing trance." 
Pattern II 
You can make her feel good, warm and trustful by having her imagine the symbol of eternal love and happyness - the rose - in 
extravagant detail. Notice the messages of the fleeting nature beauty and seizing/enjoying the moment. The seduction was 
conducted via the internet (thus all the "imagine me hugging you" stuff etc:), but as always - tailor it to your own needs. By Jobet 
Claudio, Mindlist: 
Me: Look...when you think about it...everything is fleeting. It's not how long you've had a guy... it's the wonderful memories that 
you can share together, right here, and right now. Let me give you an example. Imagine... a rose. A beautiful rose... now... hold it 
by the stem... gently... mind the thorns... now... look at the petals... notice the soft color of the petals... and how soft the petals are 
to touch... how silky smooth they are... it's such a wonderful, beautiful thing of creation... now... look at it in wonder of nature's 
beauty. Realize now... that this rose... may not look like this any more... perhaps in a couple of hours... it will lose its freshness as 
it eventually withers. But what's important... right now... is that you are looking at it... in all its splendour and beauty. Right now, 
you have it... for you to enjoy. For your eyes to look at... for it to warm your heart and make you feel so good. Its just like love. It

may not always be there... it may be with you for only a short time... what's important... is to make every moment count... to make 
every memory of it a wonderful thing to look back upon. 
Her: [a simulated response on the general theme of being mistrustful] But I can't trust anyone anymore. I'll just get hurt again. 
Me: [a trust-building image in response to the above] Okay. This will make YOU FEEL BETTER. Take a deep breath... and that 
rose that you're holding... now... I'm handing back this rose... back to you...take it gently from my hand... Now... doesn't that feel 
so good... just to realize that you can trust someone with your deepest longings... your fondest dreams... your greatest desires? I'll 
be there if you need me. Okay...one last thing...what I want you to do... is to look down at where that good feeling is coming 
from... and notice how it can get twice as strong... twice as good when you allow it to grow (go for 10 X after you're done with 
this). 
Her: [a simulated response on the general theme of feeling so good that it made her cry] Enough enough! No more please! 
[silence] You made me cry here on my computer, you know, it felt so good. 
Me: Okay okay... here... I'm hugging you now... feel the warmth of my arms." 
Pattern III 
To make the imaginary rose you give her feel even more special, you can use the following excerpt suggested by Ned Ragdnuos 
on ASF: 
"Picture a rose in your mind, smell the fragrance, see the frops of sparkling dew on the leaves, feel how the thorns are so sharp 
they penetrate your skin, yet somehow the feeling is pleasurable, like the feelings of SURRENDER, NOW TO ME I find that 
when I give a rose with my imagination, it's so much more real that those roses that other guys give, because they fade away 
(point away), whereas (continue describing how the rose you have given her will stay in her heart always, growing a little each 
day, until perhaps you'll meet again)."

Believing the Supernatural patterns

Three themes that mean more to girls than you can probably guess are here for you to elaborate on:) Daniel, ASF: 
"Our paths crossed not just by chance, but there is a reason for everything that happens, like i met you and you met me and on 
some level this will work out to be a positive experience for both of us" 
"You know people have energies, you can just sense these vibes coming from people, like i sense the feeling that you are a social, 
fun and someone who is comfortable with themselves and interacting with other people, someone who isnt afraid to get to know 
someone on a deeper level, a level that reaches past the casual introduction and into the level of deep and profound connection" 
"I believe in a higher being, someone who looks after you and make sure you meet ppl who you can get comfortable with, after all 
your destiny is to meet someone who appreciates you and what you think"

Passion to Passion pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
This pattern will actually be constructed by her. All you have to do is to carry her description of a passion for something over to a 
passion for someone (and not forgetting to self-point while doing that:) and ask her, how would that feel. 
By Kevin Kupal, mindlist: 
"It works well because you'll be seducing her from her own side of the fence, using feelings that she already feels about something 
she's "passionate" about, as opposed to trying to install feelings from the outside. 
I have field tested this and have come to one general conclusion: it works only in women who have a "passion" for something... be 
it mountainclimbing, biking, helping people etc. It fails with "boring" women... the types who say "I only stay at home and watch 
TV". 
Here are the steps. 
1. Find out if she has any activity she feels "passionate" about. Most likely, these may be her work, her hobby, extra-curricular 
activities (if still in school)... anything she would do even if she did it for free. 
2. Ask her... what's important to you in doing (activity)? What do you feel when you go (activity)?  C'mon, tell me what it feels 
like when you're there, actually doing (activity). At this point, I am actually putting her in an internal rep of actually doing that 
activity, and associating her into the states the she feels while doing the activity. I'm eliciting feelings/criteria. You're basically 
looking for nominalized "feelings" such as "satisfaction" , fulfillment, love, challenge, "rush" etc. 
3.Then, feedback these nominalized "feelings" and  link these to you. I was just wondering...well...a funny thought occurred to 
me...what would it be like when you just find yourself feeling all those feelings you have for (activity) for another person (point to 
self)?  Can you imagine what's it like if those feelings you have for (activity), you also feel for, let's say, your boyfriend (point to 
self) ? 
Example 
Me: I was just wondering, what do you really love doing? Name something that you would do that you find so engrossing that 
you'd do it, even if you were never paid to do it? 
Her: Well... when I get some stacked up vacation leaves, I go mountain climbing with the local mountain climbing association. 
Me : Oh...you like mountain climbing. I'm curious...what is it about mountain climbing that makes you love it? What do you feel 
when you're mountain climbing? What's it like when you're there now, mountain climbing? 
Her: Well...uphill its very hard and steep...but once you get to the summit, you can feel the wind on your face...all that 
exhiliration...freedom...sense of accomplishment and just this feeling of fulfillment...those make the hike worth every step... 
Me: (giggle a little)...A funny thought just came over me. I'm just wondering, what would it be like if you could feel all those 
feelings in another human being? I mean, what if you could just IMAGINE, having a boyfriend (point to self, subtly) who also 
makes you FEEL ALL THAT EXHILIRATION...that FREEDOM that sense of ACCOMPLISHMENT and deep

FULFILLMENT. When YOU'VE FOUND THAT GUY, when the time comes that YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM...feeling all 
those feelings...NOW what would it be like? 
Her : Gee...I'd do him just as much as I do mountain climbing...and with equal passion...oh...I didn't mean it like I said it!

Mental Screen pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
NightShadow, mindlist: 
NS (NightShadow): Remember where on your mental screen you saw those images of you and your old flame?
DB (Defenseless Babe): Yes
NS: Now, on that same screen recall a time you felt the most incrdible sensation that you have EVER experienced (first orgasm is 
almost always the response). Picture it and open your eyes when you feel it the most intensely (this gets her to see your face 
RIGHT AFTER those feelings. Ross prefers to have someone wag their finger and you anchor it like that.) Open your mine to me 
and allow the sound of my voice to PENETRATE your thoughts.
DB:(opens eyes)
NS: What did you see?
DB: BLAH BLAH BLAH
NS: Awesome, ok, Nude-Erection (new direction, one of my favs). After you felt that great feeling and opened your eyes and saw 
me, where you still excited?
DB: well, yeah
NS: Do I make you feel good? Thats ALL MY GOAL IS to do with you is make you feel good (who can see what I am doing 
here?). So whenever you need to feel good just imagine MY WORDS THAT I linked to your feelings and picture those feelings 
and my face on your mental screen.

Peak Experience pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Ross Jeffries: 
You: "Can you remember the last time you had a peak experience? Like climbing a mountain... or watching a beautiful sunset... 
or the first time you looked at someone (point to yourself, self-pointing, sp) and recognised YOU REALLY LOVE THIS 
PERSON (sp)." 
Her: "Sure..." 
You: "What was that like?" 
Here you should shut up and let her describe it. Listen carefully as she will give away lots of trance words. 
You: "That's really interesting. You know, I find it so neat how YOUR MINE can be going along in one direction, you know in 
an everyday ordinary state, and then SUDDENLY for whatever MYSTERIOUS reason, you just GO INTO A MUCH 
DIFFERENT STATE... a state where YOUR MINE is so in touch with the MYSTERY and the WONDER and the beauty of life 
(point to yourself, dumbshit!). And sometimes it's like in YOUR MINE, you just SLOW TIME DOWN, and the whole world 
stops, as you just LET YOURSELF GO WITH THIS (point to yourself). Can you FEEL THAT (reach out and touch anchor) is an 
incredible thing to experience… WITH ME… NOW, I know that for a lot of people different things can trigger that." 
Her: "God... yeah... I LOVE the way you talk... it's like your inside my soul." 
You: "Well, thank you (whatever-your-name-was). And you know, for a lot of people falling in love, or an orgasm are peak 
experiences, but for me, it's music. Like, the other night I was listening to Mozart, and I don't know if you are familiar with him or 
not ("Moe who?" - at least that's what Arnold Schwartzenegger responded with in Last Action Hero:), but some of his stuff is just 
a series of short little musical segments... like little pecks on the cheek, and with some of his stuff those segments just GET LAID 
(whatever-your-name-was), from end to end, and keep getting repeated. But his really great stuff is composed of these long, slow, 
lingering movements... they're like long, slow, lingering kisses... long slow lingering caresses, and you just FEEL ALL OF THAT 
ALL OVER YOUR BODY when you LISTEN... TO ME… NOW... it's an incredible thing... you know." 
Ross Jeffries: "This induces a pretty damn loosened up, altered state and you've already dropped in a few good sexual metaphors 
too. What's CRITICAL is you speak slowly, and make sure you anchor when you are getting the responses. Also...make sure your 
gestures match what you are talking about. Don't make short, choppy gestures if you are talking about long, slow, lingering, 
movements or you'll be dating your hand! Where could you go from here? Well, pretty much anywhere. You could transition to 
gathering info about her values by saying something like, "So... if you could just imagine your ideal, peak relationship... what are 
some of the things that would be important to you to be there?" Or you could move on to the blow job pattern or incredible 
connection or whatever." 
As for Moe (sorry, Mozart:) - hey, these are just examples, insert something that has deep personal meaning for you and describe 
that instead.

Natural Woman pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Mindlist: 
"Do you think most men know what women really want?" 
Of course, she'll just laugh. 
"I think most men might THINK they know, but I think almost every man makes one, huge, critical mistake when it comes to 
women..." 
(Now THAT should get them intrigued.) 
"The mistake is that they don't recognize that in each woman their are actually TWO women... the natural woman and the 
culturally programmed woman. The culturally programmed woman is the one with all the rules and all the roles... all the 
restrictions, constrictions... all the shouldn'ts, shoulds, don'ts, can'ts, mustn'ts...etc. 
But the natural woman....that's the woman right there at the core... where you keep your most exciting memories... where you 
ponder fantasies... daydreams... amazing possibilities... the things you'd do if no one were watching and no one... even your best 
friends... would ever, ever know about... 
Most men just do things that trigger the culturally programmed woman... But when a man... a rare man... can touch a woman in 
that special place in all those special ways you LONG to be touched... in ways you maybe even can't admit to yourself... then 
WOW... an almost complete transformation takes place... and you start blossoming way beyond what you ever even thought 
possible. 
So I think the smart man is the man who has the realization that that place is there... waiting and longing... even inspite the fact 
that women often have to lock all of that away... and yet they are still there..."

Meeting the Perfect Man pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
(by John Casewest) 
"You know I think that everyone with a head on their shoulders has got to have some idea of what they’re looking for in a 
relationship. 
Maybe you’ve met guys in the past where you come home from the date or get off the phone and you’re saying ‘Well he seems 
to have a lot of this, but I don’t know if he’s got enough of that’ or ‘Yeah he has a lot of what I look for but there’s just this one 
thing about him I don’t like’, and while it might seem natural to evaluate someone like that sometimes, I never do it - at least not 
with someone I’m really interested in. 
Haven’t you ever met a guy who you were just so attracted to everything about him (confusing on purpose), you could just feel 
how he satisfied all of your values, and afterwards you weren’t picking him apart with all those questions, you were just 
imagining everything that would happen the next time you were with him? - A guy where you knew he had something to offer 
and you would do whatever to be sure it was offered - to you? 
(If Yes, find out what that was like & incorporate it. If no just go on). 
You see that’s the kind of person I’m looking for - It’s like, what if you maybe started off meeting this person and you still had 
that ruler handy, that one you use in your mine to measure guys, ready to measure if he had enough of this or that, but then, as 
you talked to him longer and as the time passed you were just having so much fun, it’s as if you just started instead to pay 
attention to those gut intuitions that just said overwhelmingly ‘You want this guy, you want this guy, you want him bad!’ 
And instead of wasting your attention on measuring, you just felt that growing compulsion building, and now it’s just like all 
those values you look for just blend together and you see right then that he had what you really value, and you stop your 
measuring because this guy’s longer (sp) than your ruler (sexual innuendo)! 
With me, that’s the kind of excitement I look for in a relationship and when the excitement is there, that’s when you feel 
absolutely compelled to just go for it now (dickpoint)."

Feeling Drawn patterns
Back to the Table of Contents
Pattern I. Ross Jeffries: 
"Isn't it interesting how everyone is so different yet in so many ways we are all the same. 
I mean for example, I don't know what it is you do, when you decide for yourself that you really want to be with someone, and 
you know it's what you want, cause you find yourself imagining it ... you picture it in your mine and you look forward to it for all 
the right reasons. Reasons that are right to you because you know its what you want, but I think you know a person can find that 
when that's what's taking place, wow, what a difference in the way they think and just how readily you then begin to make time 
for this special person you are now connecting so strongly with. 
Its a totally different experience, its like you feel almost magnetically drawn to this person, you know what I mean? And 
sometimes I think a person wouldn't even know that that's what's taking place until afterwards. And you look back on it as one of 
those amazing memories you treasure/cherish for the rest of your life ... now ... with me as I think long and hard about it I think 
that's the process of discovering that a person is being drawn to another person." 
Pattern II. Ross Jeffries: 
"You know, how you can have thoughts that cause you to feel fascination. Like, I was thinking about how, for many people 
falling in love can sometimes take months. But have you ever thought about what it would be like for you to fall in love 
instantaneously where you feel like you were talking to your soulmate (point). 
I mean, imagine there being someone who was selected for you, picked out long before you were born. I mean if you were to feel 
that way, now.. I think you may be surprised to find yourself beginning to almost feel magically enchanted; and you might find 
yourself wanting to be with this person in a very special way. 
Because, when a person feels they have met their soulmate, like when you imagine this person being your dream lover (sp), I 
think you would feel a mysterious yet powerful loving connection taking place between you and him that when . . that's really 
happening . . with me in my way of thinking what is happening is . . you go inside yourself (down into your subconscious) and 
you find all those values that are most important to you in a relationship and you think about the qualities in a personality you 
want your ideal lover to have (sp), and then find those and link them up with the person you're talking to (sp), in such a way that a 
picture of him (frame), for whatever mysterious reason gets locked permanently in that special place in your mind where you 
deeply love and care for someone (sp), to the point where as that picture gets bigger and brighter and the sounds inside you 
mmmmm intensify, you might find yourself thinking of other things, where all your resistance is falling away and you just can't 
control yourself and you just want to go wild with it. 
Isn't that truly the mystery of falling in love that we all dream of?" 
Pattern III. An example of simple attraction pattern combined with a kino approach/close. Best used after having established 
rapport, having created states of pleasure and having made her already interested. Daniel, ASF:

How to Lay Girls Guide
"You know... sometimes... when I meet someone I get this feeling inside (PTS)... I don't know what it is... but I know it feels good 
(PTS)... and I can't help but want to get close to that person and get to know her... (point to her)... do you ever get that feeling 
when you meet a guy (PTS)? 
(Let her say stuff... if its positive move on, if negative do some more rapport building...) 
Passion and desire (touch her neck)... the feeling that you cant hold back... you want to touch the person (PTS or if u feel brave 
take her hand and make it touch your chest)... the desire builds and builds (touch her arm)... your mind goes numb because the 
feeling is so pleasurable... (touch her arm)... your legs get shaky (touch her hips) and your tummy feels weird (touch her 
stomach)" 
(Note: she should be fucking dripping... and if she ain't you shouldn't have launched these without establishing anchors and 
rapport. If she's ok, smile and look in her eyes and DON'T say a fucking thing for 3 seconds) 
Passion and desire.. (touch neck and pull her a little closer) 
(KINO TIME, kiss etc. BTW its more effective if you are both sitting down...)" 
Pattern IV. Ask the girl what does it feel like to be attracted to somebody - by feeding her with the answers yourself to make her 
feel exactly that, while you have already linked those feelings to "being attracted to someone". Devious:) Daniel J. Mocsny, ASF: 
""When you find a man attractive, where do you feel it first? Do you feel butterflies in your stomach? Does your face start to 
tingle? Does your throat tighten up a little and make it hard for you to speak? When you realize that you find a man attractive, 
how do you behave around him to let him know you are interested before he has let you know he's interested?" 
You can learn a lot from observing how she reacts to these kinds of questions, in addition to whatever she says. For example, if 
these questions make her obviously uncomfortable in an unpleasant kind of way, you should go talk to another woman. On the 
other hand, if she launches enthusiastically into a wide-eyed description of how she feels and acts, and she begins fixing her 
attention on you and smiling, then you are successfully flirting with her. 
If you can get a woman to talk about the process by which she feels attraction and expresses it, that gives her an opportunity to 
move her mind into that state."

Incredible Connection patterns
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Pattern 1 - a classic:) Also an important note, why patterns might not work on some women. 
This is the most classic and legendary of SS patterns. Partly because it is one of the oldest and partly because it is the most 
appropriate to use as your first pattern after having had some fluff talk with the girl you just met. 
A very important note on the IC pattern (and even patterning in general) - there are women that are NOT into the 
feelings/connections stuff at all. So what's wrong with them? Nothing, they are just into SEX and getting down with you! Yes, 
believe it or not, there are women like that, just waiting to be discovered. Of course, they are a minority, otherwise you wouldn't 
be reading all this:) But they do exist and it is important to notice them in time and not to keep them waiting while you're busy 
delivering your patterns and trying to make her feel wonderful etc. You could just be shutting her down. So although they are a 
rarity and an exception, keep your eyes open because you never know when you just might find a gem like that:) 
In the words of Ross Jeffries (Ross Jeffries): "Not all women will respond to "connection" patterns. Some women who are already 
emotionally occupied, but sexually bored, or shut down emotionally, but open sexually or just don't believe relationships are 
possible will still be very receptive to a "body sensation" approach." This actually means, that she won't be much moved by your 
descriptions of "emotional connections" but will be entrhalled, once you include feelings of bodily sensations in you patterns. But 
most probably they'd actually prefer to feel those bodily sensations instead of imagining them, and that is your cue to go kino:) 
(See Kinaesthetics for more information) 
Nevertheless, the "incredible connection" theme has an almost universal appeal for women, se here's the pattern: 
"In fact... just standing here... talking with you... I have an intuition... that when you connect with someone... someone you really 
like... someone you're really attracted to who makes you feel that click… right there... you know that sense of just feeling totally 
drawn... like you've known this person forever... like you were meant to know them.... a big part of it is that recognition that you 
can RELAX and laugh with this person… can you feel _that_ (touch her and achor the feeling)... is maybe how it works?" 
From here you could for example transition to the Falling in Love pattern. 
Update. Madman: "The IC pattern is NOT a good pattern to introduce as the first pattern after some initial fluff talk. You must 
have established some sort of a connection first with some other patterns and only THEN can you help her realise through using 
the IC pattern that "yes, that's exactly how I feel right now!". Using the IC pattern won't establish a connection by itself. So the 
way to do it is this: 
1) Initial fluff talk to establish some faint rapport 
2) Patterns and tonality to establish deeper rapport. Take your time, don't hurry, slow down the tempo of the conversation, watch 
your tonality. She'll be feeling a lot by now, but she is probably confused as to the nature of her feelings, so its time for step 3. 
3) IC pattern (or a modification of it) to help her realise that an incredible connection with YOU is exactly what she is feeling at 
the moment:)"

Falling in Love pattern 
Pattern 2 - Incredible Connection mixed with a little Falling in Love. 
Remember, this pattern will make HER feel an incredible connection with YOU. ASF: 
"I recently just got out of a long relationship. I guess I'm not your average guy. I mean for me... I have to develop a mental 
relationship with someone before anything more will happen. I really have to "Connect" with someone first... I mean.... Have you 
ever been talking to someone and noticed that everything around you seemed to fade away? ...and as you listened more and more 
you began to focus more and more of your attention on him. Do you remember how that felt to truly start becoming attracted to 
someone? Maybe you remember feeling "butterflies" in your stomach? To become attracted to someone.... not only because of 
their physical appearance... but because of who they are... because as you listened to them, their true attitudes and beliefs became 
apparent to you. As you listened to what they had to say... you suddenly realised that this guy was truly unique. Finally, you had 
found your "MAN". Do you remember the last time this happened? Maybe, you felt a little scared or nervous at first because you 
were feeling such an incredible connection. Or maybe... you began to think about "What might happen in the near future?" How 
your heart would speed up as he began to move closer to you... How you would feel such an Amazing RUSH of energy as he held 
you tight in his arms... or how it would feel to have his lips Pressed against yours for the first time. Maybe the little girl inside you 
dreams about meeting a man like this at night... Maybe you think about what steps you would need to take to Hold On to this guy 
once you finally meet him? I mean... maybe it seems like I have gone off on a tangent here... but that is how I feel." 
Pattern 3 
Ross Jeffries: 
"Did you ever . . instantly know you were going to like and trust someone for a long, long time? (sp). Like maybe even though 
you only knew them for a short while . . it seemed like you had known them your whole life, as if there were this timeless 
connection between you and them (point from her to you). I mean, you know that feeling of incredible bonding, when all barriers 
just drop away and melt and you just feel totally comfortable and at ease with them (sp). And its like maybe you were even able to 
(And you might find that you are able to) imagine a time in the future, say years from now, still being incredibly connected to this 
person (sp) and looking back on today as having been the start of it? I just think that's the neatest think when a person can . . go 
inside and . . instantly recognize all those qualities and values in that other person, that . . lets that connection take place with 
someone (point) . . with me, it usually takes a bit longer. 
But when you really FEEL A CONNECTION WITH SOMEONE. You know that mysterious, timeless link that just makes you 
feel like you've known someone forever...like you were meant to know them....and it's almost like YOU'RE LOOKING RIGHT 
AT YOUR FUTURE...like YOUR FUTURE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU...when you FEEL THAT...it all starts out as an 
actual physical click... a tug that takes place right...(raise your hand over your head, point your index finger, and then SLOWLY 
bring it down straight down the middle of her face, without touching her until you get to her solar plexus, just below her 
breasts)..THERE!(touch her solar plexus) Can you FEEL THAT(squeeze her hand with your free hand) is maybe how that can 
happen...NOW...WITH ME...I just find that's such a great feeling...isn't it? 
I think it's so funny how some people can just do that and let it happen instantaneously (snap) because for me it takes longer. But I 
do find that during the course of an evening (a conversation), as you really listen to someone (pt), and you start to recognize those 
values and qualities in them that you hold so dearly for yourself with me that's when you can make that connection and really feel 
that growing bond. 
But what I find really interesting is .. what can happen is when you FEEL THAT CONNECTION, that warm, safe and 
comfortable feeling right there, then what can sometimes happen is a picture of this new person your connecting with will sneak 
itself right into that special location in YOUR MINE where one keeps a person they care deeply for, and that's how you know 
you're already starting to fall for this person. And sometimes during the course of the evening or maybe even during a simple 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/p_iconnection.htm (2 of 5) [8/3/2002 9:34:39 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
conversation like this one you'll look up at that picture and as you continue to feel that attraction growing, its like that picture gets 
bigger and brighter. And that's how you know you really just want to be with this person and you're really READY to be swept off 
your feet. NOW the funny thing is, when you have that kind of connection with a new person (sp), maybe as you're snuggling in 
the sheets about to fall asleep, again (pop) up comes that picture of this person in that special special place and also maybe at 
some time during the day like when you're stepping into the shower or you hear the sound of running water again it reminds you 
to see that picture so clearly in your mine." 
Pattern 4 
From David Shade's online seduction log: 
"You want to feel trust for this person because you know you really like this person, so you take the time to build the trust. 
Building trust takes being honest with each other while at the same time being independent. You want to be with someone who is 
communicative and shares their feelings freely. And you want to get to the point where you can almost know what they are 
thinking, like you could finish their sentences. You so much want to know what this person is feeling, and you want them to know 
what you are feeling. And then you get to the point where you almost want this person to feel the same feelings you are feeling. 
That is when it is really special." 
Pattern 5 
Use this assuming that you've been talking to the girl about incredible connections before, but somehow things haven't yet quite 
turned out the way they should have:) But seriously, there are girls, for whom the patterns have a delayed effect, in which case 
this follow-up is just perfect for helping her realise what she feels and wants the next time you meet. 
Ross Jeffries: 
"You know the other day we were talking about how sometimes one can suddenly find themselves feeling really connected to 
someone. 
Me, it happens rarely but when IT IS HAPPENING, I often find I wasn't aware of it until afterwards and you realize it was the 
start of something amazing. Something you'll always cherish for the rest of your life. 
I mean sometimes a person can just be looking at someone and suddenly for whatever mysterious reason, feel a connection so 
powerfully taking place, a connection that just lets you know that this person is going to be really special in your life where you 
find yourself so easily imaging being with this person in that special way two people can be together who feel that growing 
attraction, but then sometimes you don't even NOTICE AND FEEL ITS TAKEN PLACE .. NOW WITH ME I find though that 
later when you LOOK BACK ON THE WONDERFUL, DELIGHTFUL THINGS THAT TOOK PLACE and suddenly you 
realize how ENCHANTED YOU FIND YOURSELF FEELING HMMMMM, its like you FALL UNDER A SPELL and you 
FEEL SWEPT OFF YOUR FEET and you loose your sense of time and space NOW, as if your ENTIRE WORLD IS THIS 
PERSON (IN FRONT OF YOU), like you're LOOKING/listening to your FUTURE as you just continue to LISTEN SO 
CAREFULLY. 
And I think you may not FEEL THAT CONNECTION INSTANTEOUSLY, but even over short conversation like this one ... a 
person can find themselves starting to naturally realize that this person is someone who totally meets their criteria for someone 
you want to spend time with in that special way. In a way that makes you feel mmmm you know what I mean. 
And you RECOGNIZE WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT that you really are looking forward to spending more time 
with this person and the more you allow yourself to feel this the more you begin to think of other things (point to your dick) that 
can be so delightful. And you begin to feel so safe and uninhibited so that you know its OK to just let yourself go and imagine 
having your fantasies really come true .. NOW WITH me thats how I sometimes SEE IT THAT WAY." 
Pattern 6 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/p_iconnection.htm (3 of 5) [8/3/2002 9:34:39 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
Ross Jeffries: 
"Can I ask you a question, I know this may sound funny but, have you ever felt absolutely comfortable and at ease talking with 
someone (you just met)? I mean, when . . that's happening, its like this (powerful, loving) connection is taking place between you 
and them (sp). And maybe you were even able to... imagine a time in the future, say years from now, still feeling that sense of 
connection and looking back on today as having been the start of it. And you might find you feel such a strong attraction that you 
aren't even aware of what you are doing since your mine doesn't want you to know what your body is doing until afterwards, and 
you can reflect on how wonderful and pleasurable the experience is and you are so glad you didn't miss out on anything." 
Pattern 7 
Ross Jeffries: 
"Let me ask you a question. Have you ever been totally fascinated with someone? Like maybe as you were there, looking at him, 
and you started to listen carefully, it was like his voice just seemed to wrap itself around you, to the point where the rest of you 
environment just disappeared, and you entire world, everything you saw, became what was right in front of you? And anything he 
described, you found that you could just picture it clearly? So you know, if he were to talk about a romantic walk, on a moonlit 
beach, with your perfect partner, you could just see yourself there with him, just enjoying that, that's what it would be like" 
Pattern 8 
Ross Jeffries: 
"Did you ever instantly know you were going to like and trust someone for a long, long time? Maybe you only knew them for a 
short while but it seemed that you had known them your whole life, as if there was a timeless connection between you and them? 
I'm wondering as you are listen so carefully, if you can remember the feeling of that, and just how wonderful it was because 
sometimes life has a way of making us remember those things, right prior to discovering that we can experience those feelings 
again with someone. 
Me well, I don't think that kind of thing can be forced. No essay or words or can allow that to happen, but you just begin to 
recognize now how much you want to be with someone who is so good for you. Words and appearances are only expressions, the 
vehicles that contain the essence that moves us. It can only happen naturally as the expression of an energy between two people, 
but when it does, you just know that feeling of incredible bonding, when all barriers melt and drop away, and two people come 
together, fused into one spiritual essence, mingling energies, building and increasing and intensifying, mingling into an expression 
of aliveness that words can initiate but never capture fully. 
It has to be indulged inside your imagination, dwelled on, and toyed with, deep, deep inside you. Speaking to you as a person who 
can experience that kind of connection, just how much can you look forward to enjoying that with someone who moves you in 
that way? As you remember what that would be like, and find those possibilities opening before you, in such a way that anything 
else blurs into insignificance, how powerfully will you feel that urge to be with someone in that special way and find out more 
about this person who has so moved you, with just words? As you might BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE NOW you want to meet with 
me, realize I can be reached at [...]." 
Pattern 9 
Ross Jeffries: 
"What's it like when you're so attracted to the sound of a man's voice, that whenever you find yourself really listening, its like the 
warmth of that voice just starts to wrap itself around you, and spreads all through you, maybe to the point where you find yourself 
thinking about being with him in a mmmmmmm special way, in a way that would make you both feel mmmmm you know? You 
hear their voice in your mind maybe when you're falling asleep you get that feeling on the inside and you feel warm all over. So 
much so that as those pictures in your mind get bigger, and brighter and more intense, and those feelings mm intensify you could

just experience an overwhelming desire, a desire to be with him to the point where you just had to be with him in that special way 
(pick up the phone, and invite him over)" 
Pattern 10 
Remind her of all her feelings she has always wanted to share and what a wonderful experience it is to find someone to share all 
those feelings with. Not specifically an IC pattern, but related nevertheless, as you are creating a feeling in her of being so 
completely understood. 
Ross Jeffries: 
"Do you remember when you were a little child and you went to bed expecting tomorrow to be a rainy stormy day? But you woke 
up the next morning and to your delight and surprise, you looked out to see a brightly shining sun, and not a cloud in the sky? And 
you realized, "Hey...this day is MINE to make happen?" Imagine sharing those feelings everyday with someone who truly 
understands, along with the passions only adults can create and share." 
Pattern 11 
Incredible connection via greeting card or e-mail. Jonathan Ness, mindlist: 
"Isn't it crazy (soften...soften...) how you meet somebody and you just feel an instantaneous connection... With me, it's like a click 
right in your stomach when you realize you're going to like and trust this person for a long time. That's how I felt ("You go first" 
principle...) when I met you at [where] [when]. I confess (girls LOVE confessions...), I have been thinking about you, wondering 
how much you have been thinking about me, too. (not "whether" but "how much"!). How surprised would you be to find yourself 
wishing you could spend some more time with me... Right now, I can see us over coffee laughing and having the best time. As 
you think about this more and more, I'm sure that you can feel a smile coming to your face, realizing how much fun we're going to 
have. Let's meet [where] [when] for lunch, around noon, so we can get to know each other better. Or, if Friday night would work 
better for you, give me a call at [number] and we'll arrange the details." 
Pattern 12 
Notice the tie-in with the Cialdani Reciprocation Principle. Kevin Kupal, mindlist: 
"Have you ever felt an instantaneous connection with someone (point to self), a guy who just makes you FEEL THAT CLICK, 
right there (click in front of her chest). And when you do, I bet, that guy can just make you  FEEL SO WARM AND 
WONDERFUL, DEEP INSIDE YOU... make you FEEL such a FANTASTIC DELIGHT, an INTENSE, DELICIOUS 
PLEASURE... inside YOUR MINE... DEEP INSIDE YOU... just by being with him (point to self), just by looking at him (she's 
looking at you, dummy). Now, I WONDER how you WONDER how when you've found that guy (point to self), and FEEL ALL 
THE DELIGHT he gives you,  how will you give back to him some of the delight that he makes you feel... how will you GIVE 
YOUR ALL to please and delight him (point to self), even just an inkling of the delight he gives to you? How good will you feel 
just by giving him back some of the incredible delight he gives you? When you feel that the more you please him, the more you 
exponentially please yourself?"

Dream pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
"Have you ever had dreams about someone you really really like? Me, for instance, I find that when you meet somebody who 
you're very attracted to , and you start to THINK ABOUT THAT PERSON all the time, that's when you can really begin to 
NOTICE THAT PERSON IN YOUR DREAMS. I mean you know how you REMEMBER some dreams, and others you 
FORGET? It's like when you constantly THINK ABOUT THIS PERSON, your conscious mind GOES DOWN REAL DEEP into 
your subconscious and BRINGS BACK all these wonderful dreams about them. If you were to DO THAT at night, how long 
would it take you to REALIZE that you're dreaming about this person? Me, I've had that happen before many times..." 
Ross Jeffries: "The key, for people seeing such a pattern for the first time, is to be visually perceivable, but not consciously 
noticeable. If you point down frantically at your crotch and say real loud "GOES DOWN REAL DEEP" at the dinner table, yer 
gonna get slapped, okay?"

people so tightly together, that nothing or nobody can tear them apart and complete love and warmth oozes out of every part of 
their intertwined bodies. Isn't it wonderful, how two people can meet by chance and feel such closeness that they want to be 
together now and forever? I'm talking about this incredible connection between two people on all levels of intimacy - intellectual,

"Too bad we don't… but if we could…" pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Starts out with a "flower modification" of the IC pattern. ASF: 
You: You like flowers don't you?
Her: Sure
You: And you like getting flowers from someone who means something to you, don't you? It makes you feel all warm and special 
doesn't it?
Her: Yeah
You: I bet you've got a favourite kind of flower. Don't tell me what it is, I just want you to think about it for a minute. You know, 
I was talking with a friend the other day, and she started telling me about how we don't take time to smell the flowers anymore. 
And I thought, but wouldn't it be great if we did? I mean, can you imagine what it's like to have someone special just hand you 
your favourite kind of flower, in person, face to face, and imagine what it's like to inhale that enchanting fragrance again, right 
now? And as you look into the eyes of that person right there in front of you, and feel that smile welling up, don't you just start to 
feel really good, and begin to feel a special bond with him? I mean have you ever felt an instantaneous connection with someone? 
Me, I know I have. It's like I begin to feel like I've know this person forever, and I was always meant to know them, and you can 
just imagine a time in the future, say six months from now, still feeling that wonderful sense of connection, looking back on today 
as having been the start of it all. Can you feel that is a wonderful thing to experience?
Her: (whatever she says)
You: She also said we don't take time to savour the experiences we've had in the past .. the feelings of love we've had .. (Insert 
here) But oh man, when you do! It's like . .[go into a description of the feelings of being in love .. the faster heart rate, the 
anticipation of being with the loved one, etc.]
You: She said that we gulp food and don't take time to even enjoy our desert. I love dessert, especially ice cream. You know 
(Blow Job pattern, anyone?:)
Basically: have your "friend" say, "It's too bad we don't do or can't do X." And then you say, "But if you could . . ." And then go 
on to describe the state you want.

Odious, ASF: "Women ask me how I make good girls want to be bad (this guy has "I'll make good girls want to be bad" in his 
online-profile), etc. My answer is, I show them how to find their desires". 
Odious: 
"When you just stop... and look deep inside of you... and you are able to push aside all the rules and restrictions that hold you 
back... you find that you are free to look at your own desires with eyes unclouded by the fears of others. You can look deep 
inside and see that special place where you keep all your secrets. Inside is what you desire. You can see your desires and when 
you see your desires, you know that what you want is right there waiting for you to act on your desire. Now, with me... that's 
quite a powerful thing. When you see your desires clearly, maybe for the first time, the excitement and longing you feel is very 
strong. The excitement of knowing you can fulfil these desires and the longing of wanting so share that experience with someone 
who understands how you feel. When you allow your feelings and desires to dictate your actions... you can look deep inside 
yourself with eyes unclouded by the fears of others... and now see your true desires... and know this is something you have to

LISTEN TO THIS VOICE, it's telling you... YOU WANNA HAVE SEX, YOU WANNA HAVE SEX... YOU NEED TO HAVE

"The more… the more" pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Ross Jeffries: "Another very simple and powerful way to thought bind is to use a pattern my good friend and teacher Kenrick 
Cleveland calls "the more the more pattern". A simple way to use this, in a pickup, is to get a woman laughing. Once she laughs, 
call attention to it by saying something like, "See...you're laughing. It feels good to laugh. And the more you laugh, the more 
you'll discover that you really want to go out with me!". Now, it sounds too simple, but it works! "The more... the more" basically 
is saying that doing one thing causes you or makes you do something else. Here's some other possible uses: 
G     The more you try to think of reasons why you can't, the more you realise just how much you can. 
G     The more you laugh the more you recognise how much fun it would be to spend time together, NOW. Do you want to have 
coffee, or would lunch be better? 
G     The more you try to think of (whatever important male in her life), the more you find yourself thinking of me." or "The 
more you are thinking about him, the more you find you thoughts coming back to me. 
G     The more you are thinking about leaving, the more you know you have to stay for me. 
G     The more you're thinking about the music, the more you realise it would be fun to dance with me:)" 
Update. Make her a believer:) Ross Jeffries: 
"I don't know how exactly you'll absolutely convince yourself that what I am saying is totally true and right and the more you 
might resist that suggestion the more the deeper and much more open part of you is beginning to find reasons why its true. Maybe 
not the reasons I suggest but your own reasons and that how you can know its true because you yourself are having those 
thoughts, it isn't me. And you don't argue with your own thinking do you?"

Reading the Poem pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
ASF: "If you are going to read her poetry, get her really curious first, don't just blurt it out to entertain her. Challenge with 
something like: "Have you ever been there thinking about someone, and for whatever reason you just go into a very playful, light-
hearted, creative state and in that, I guess you could even call it a romantic state, you just do things you wouldn't usually do. Like 
the other day I just grabbed a pen and wrote a whole bunch of stuff, and when I looked at it afterwards, I thought hey this is like 
poetry or something. I've never shared stuff like this with anyone, and I don't know if you're the sort of person who would be open 
enough to appreciate it because for me it's very personal, it'd be letting you into a part of my mind nobody has ever shared before, 
and you'd have to leave behind all the rules, all the roles, all the peer pressure and come, bare of all preconceptions as it were, 
ready to take this essence (SP) deep inside you and make it part of who you are, now with me..."."

Use poetry
Back to the Table of Contents
Poems will sweep women off their feet. Take them out of your pockets and recite. Or send them in a letter. You can also 
memorise them if you really want to impress her but even the real poets almost never recite their own poems by heart. By reading 
them from a piece of paper they can be sure it will be just as beautiful as it was when they created it and instead they can 
concentrate on the tonality of reciting (which is probably even more important than the poems themselves:). 
You can turn to classic love-poetry (libraries etc.) or - once you get a grasp of patterns, you can start writing your own poems with 
the themes and messages that you wish to include. 
There is always the moral dilemma of whether to present someone else's poetry as your own. Presenting it as your own will make 
her feel much more intense about the messages and pictures painted in the poem, but if such insincerity bothers you, it might 
make you feel that much worse. Then again, being able to make her feel even better should make you feel just as much better 
about it, so I leave it to thee to decide, how to go about this problem. 
If you do present them as your own though, don't forget to add, that you're not really much of a poet and you write extremely 
seldom and only when you really deeply feel like it. Otherwise she might ask you to write something for HER (she might do it 
anyway, but this way you at least have an explanation for stalling:). 
And here are a few poems to get you started: 
Poem 1
Some say the world will end in fire
Some say 'twill end in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire,
I hold with those who favour fire,
That fire within your eyes. 
Poem 2
I wish a was your tear-drop,
Conceived in your heart,
Born in your eyes,
Lived on your cheeks,
And died on your lips. 
Poem 3 by Jacques Prévert (no, that name is not a joke, that is actually a famous French poet:)
Une orange sur la table
Ta robe sur le tapis
Et toi dans mon lit
Doux présent du présent
Fraîcheur de la nuit
Chaleru de ma vie.

An orange on the table
A robe on the floor
And you on my bed
A delicate present of the present
The coolness of night
The warmth of my life. 
Poem 4 by Jacques Prévert
Trois allumettes une à une allumees dans la nuit
La première pour voir ton visage tout entier
La seconde pour voir tes yeux
La dernière pour voir ta bouche
Et l'obscurité toute entiere pour me rappeler tout cela
En te serrant dans mes bras. 
Poem 4 translation
One by one, three matches are lit in the night
The first to see your face
The second to see your eyes
The last to see your lips
So when its dark all around, I can remember it all
While holding you in my arms.

Fascination
by Ross Jeffries 
Have you ever been fascinated
by someone whose words just seemed to
PENETRATE you?
You FIND YOURSELF LOOKING
and you can't look away
and the more that you try
the more that GAZE STAYS
RIVETED HERE
where you want it to be
cause you know that there's something
you just have to see
As you LISTEN SO CLOSE
and you START TO WONDER
what would it feel like
to be FALLING UNDER
A spell, mm...so magic
being spun by the sound
of a voice whose rich warmth
was spreading on down.
Have you ever experienced
INSTANTANEOUS CONNECTION?
To the point where your thoughts moved in
mmm....

Just one direction?
People sometimes ask,
"Please...just a kiss!"
Funny how you find yourself
WISHING THE SAME WISH
Your mine is amazing
when you really
LET IT GO
As you FIND YOURSELF PICTURING
mmm...you know?
As the warmth of that voice
takes on a glow
spreading and pulsating
where you want it to go
I will tell you all you desire...
ME...I know.
You step out of what was
Invited, slipped inside
Feels like warm rain
Between your sighs
And it's not important
that you find
every inhibition
is left far behind.
As you recall how it feels
To be SO IN LOVE
And you SEE THAT IMAGE of us
(point to it) Up above
You see at last
who you've finally found
what you've looked for
and longed for
has finally COME round.

Intuition
by Unknown 
When you begin to listen
And hang on every word,
You get an intuition.
Your mind is now your lord.
You hear this voice, inside you,
The voice you've heard before.
This voice has been there for you.

This voice has opened doors.
As just a little girl,
You found a special friend,
This voice told you "Just do it!
Your joy will never end!"
Remember all those times
This voice was in your mind.
It will be there forever,
Until the end of time.
In only a few seconds,
If you should hear this voice,
You can really trust it,
Let it make your choice.
This voice now whispers to you
The thoughts that come between
Your thoughts, inside your heart,
The wishes deep within.
The wishes you're denying,
The ones you're longing for.
This voice tells you, "Just do it.
Step through that open door.
Leave all your cares behind you,
Your future now unfolds.
You're free from inhibition.
Free from society's holds.
Take in what is before you,
Embrace it in your soul.
Allow it deep inside you,
And let it fill that hole."
This voice knows what you're thinking.
This voice is very wise.
Just trust your intuition,
And follow its advice. 
Poem 7 
Rose in Your Heart
by Dan Steward 
What is it like to close your eyes
As deep inside you fantasize,
These feelings which your body knows
That stem from just this single rose.
You feel a smile bloom on your lips,
Feel velvet brush your fingertips,
Feel pleasure building, blood afire,
As eyes gaze deep on heart's desire.

You sense a fragrance in the air,
and see this one who'll take you there.
a laugh of joy, a sigh of bliss,
My lips meet yours in perfect kiss.
And feeling now this dream so right

The key you've yearned for from the start
To free this rose held in your heart.

Poem 8 
The Warrior's Bottle
by Bishop 
There exists a tradition, centuries gone by 
Of a warrior's bottle, and a lover's night cry 
The tradition is said, to determine the fate 
Of the mighty warrior, and his beautiful mate 
A small bottle is given, from he to his lover 
Made of delicate glass, and a cork for a cover 
Then off he would go, into a long bloodied war 
His mate left to worry, and long for him more 
She kept the bottle close, and warm by her heart 
Then like the falling rain, her tears would now start 
Flowing from her cheeks, she wiped none away 
Into the bottle, is where they must lay 
Day into night, then night into day 
Every new tear, being stored away 
If the warrior survived, and returned from his quest 
He would remove the bottle, that lay near her chest 
If tears filled the bottle, near overflow 
Nothing was said, for now he did know 
It was without question, she loved only he 
And had been faithful, despite being free 
They would make love, until first light 
Their spirits would soar, their fires ignite. 
And if you look up, on such a magical night 
You would see a star born, and burning so bright. 
Poem 9 
The Lover's Dance
by Bishop 
Come with me, my lovely, as we start The Lover's Dance. 
Take hold of my hand, and rise up with me. 
Our wings spread wide, and our passions laid bare. 
Higher we soar, with each heated breath. 
And upon the clouds we sit, looking over our kingdom below. 
Me upon you, for we have begun The Lover's Dance. 
Words never spoken, yet images abound 
Time does not hold us here, so we dance without a care 
And all that you have dreamed, shines brightly into reality

Poem 10 
The Lover's Dance 2: To The Garden Once More
by Bishop 
[Warning by Bishop: Only use/send it AFTER you have sent her the first "Lover's Dance" poem, and she's expressed a positive 
reaction to it, or else you'll freak her out! My personal signal that I have the green light, is if she makes ANY kind of sexual 
reference in her response to the first poem. Then I send them "A Warm Fuzzy" and then "Lover's Dance 2") 
As I lay down inside the warm water of a soothing bath, 
feeling those muscles relaxing...surrendering...I sense you watching me. 
Watching me like a cat...purring seductively...preparing to pounce. 
My muscles twitch in nervous excitement...and I become aroused. 
You leap from your hiding place, an animalistic gleam in your eyes. 
Landing with a splash, you wrap your arms around me. 
The wetness...the nakedness...of our bodies...is like slippery silk. 
I thrust my tongue between your parted lips, and we share a passionate kiss. 
As I share a deep thought in each others eyes, you put your hands into the water...and explore. 
You guide the object of your desire to where you want it..and..let out a pleased moan. 
Our bodies blend into one, as we seem to float...to travel...back. 
Back to the garden we have gone...another tree to plant. 
I gently bite your neck, as you apply the pressure from your nails in my back. 
The Dance of Lover's, we have learned it well together. 
There are no words to be said, instinct and primal desire make the decisions. 
You kiss my chest, and I rub your wet hair across my face. 
Our motions intensify, and you grab my shoulders. 
You tease my mouth with fleeting contact from your chest...then again...and again. 
This passion we have created...in this moment...is beyond words... 
beyond anything... your mind will concoct deep inside you. 
I pull you down...then under me...in one fluid motion. 
The Lover's Dance continues. 
By the time we both...release...and return once again to our shared bath, 
there is little water left inside the tub. 
We take our time exiting, never disconnecting. 
I carry you...dripping wet...out of the room...and onto the bed. 
You turn me over, laying me on my back...keeping our connection... 
and taking the upper spot...the balcony seat. 
I cannot budge, you have me pinned. 
You create the rhythm...a hard...long...series of motions. 
I thrust my head back in pleasure...and the room spins. 
You shudder with an explosion...deep within you...taking in the passion. 
Then you disconnect...and let me taste. 
With not a single word spoken, we become even more animalistic, 
flying off of the bed and onto the floor. 
The passion continues to intensify...as we work...ourselves...up..along...the wall. 
You continue up...while I linger down. 
You grab my head and grip my hair between your fingers. 
I feel the rush of your next release...and accept it all. 
Returning to meet you, I turn you around...to face the wall. 
I reach around and cup you...as we begin our Lover's Dance anew. 
Our legs tighten in fatigue...but we refuse to relent. 
The Dance lasts for several more moments...then...you reach around...

take ahold of me...and accept my release. 
We share in our gifts to each other, as we once again fall onto the bed. 
Laying together, we take pleasure...in the warmth...of our heated bodies. 
And as we listen closely...for a moment...the twin beats of our hearts...unite as one. 
Soon, the relaxing wind will put us in slumber...and we will sleep. 
Within that sleep...our Lover's Dance continues. 
We will never know for sure...when we were dreaming...and when we were not. 
The night will give way to day...and our next Dance will begin. 
Poem 11 
Lover's Eyes 
by William 
I stare now deep into my lover's eyes 
Our foreheads meet, her breath is mixed with mine. 
We share that bond, a touch felt deep within. 
We feel desire, to touch with love again. 
She pulls me slowly down and to her mouth 
To taste her tongue. Her wetness does not douse 
The heat she feels is growing hard to stop 
Consumes us both, our passion burns our thoughts. 
I lay her gently on her bed, and then 
I slowly take off all her clothes, again 
To taste the flavor of her skin, my lips 
Caress each inch from throat to breast to hip. 
I slowly bring her gasping to that peak 
My tongue it probes her lips with pleasure seeks 
To make her feel so good she cannot bear 
For me to stop, I kiss her 'till she's there. 
Our breath now comes in hot quick pants, we move 
As one, our souls complete. Our passion proves 
Our love beyond all spoken words, we've touched 
that depth, and lay secure in naked touch. 
Poem 12 
Imagine [insert her name here] 
by D.L. Whited 
Imagine [insert her name here], if you can 
The silky softness of my hand 
Trembling lips against your cheek 
Tender kiss to make you weak 
Pushing close not asking why 
Bodies melting with a sigh 
Burning ache turns into flame 
As I gently speak your name 
Begging you to feed the fire 
With every inch of your desire 
Breathing deep the smell of lust

David Shade's real-life seduction
Back to the Table of Contents
My fellow asf ng buddies. You have not heard from me in over 2 months. I have been very busy with my new found confidence to 
approach any woman anywhere with openers that actually work, since finishing Ross' basic home study course. 
I have also been spending most of my online time reading the SS list. There are some fantastic success stories there, especially 
from guys like Bishop. I have learned almost as much from the SS list as from the course. 
Here is my report for last week. As you will see, it is a lot different from my previous reports. This is going to sound a lot like a 
Bishop post, but that is because he is my role model and I thought about what he would do. Don't ask me for the patterns used. 
They are from the course and various posts in the SS list. 
So I'm walking through the ladies dresses section in a fancy clothing store at the mall and happen to see an attractive sales girl 
walking towards me. She is about an 8, late 20s, 5'7", tight slender build, nice eyes, and reeeeel purdy lips. She has cropped short 
black hair and wire rim glasses. The artsy creative type. I look straight into her eyes. She looks. We continue looking at each other 
as we approach. Just before she passes she smiles and I smile back. I now know she has a good attitude. I walk a few more steps 
and turn around and walk to where she is putting clothes on a rack. I approach and use Ross' AB opener. She blushes bright pink 
and says "Oh thank you." I anchor that with my left hand on the top of her right wrist and say "I did not mean to make you blush." 
Then I extend my hand and say "My name's David." She shakes it and says "My name's Lisa." I go for the number in the 
challenging fashion that Ross instructs us to do in the course. She says "OK, let me get my card and give you my number here at 
work!" She starts to walk and I say "You are very busy here at work, is there a way I might reach you when you are not so busy?" 
She says "I don't want to do that. You can always call me here, or, you can give me your number." I say "I am never home and I 
seem to always miss calls. Do you have access to email?" She says "No, but I can call you and leave a message and you can call 
me back!" I use Bishop's famous challenge line here. She looks at me disappointed and says "No, please don't do that! What do 
you do?" I say "I'm an engineer at ***." She says "Oh I used to work there. But I am a very creative type. I left there to come here 
and to start my own jewelry making business. They could not appreciate me there." I say "I am only analytical at work, after work 
I relax and enjoy being a human being." She says "Oh I know what you mean." I say "In fact, I too enjoy being creative." She says 
"I know, I could see it in your eyes." I say "Is that so?" She says "Yes, and you have very intense eyes." I look very intensely at 
her and say "I hope you are not intimidated by very intense eyes" and then smile. She says "Oh No, not at all. In fact, I like them. 
What is your creative medium?" I say "I like to write poetry." She says "Oh really, I love poetry." I say "Well, I would love to 
read some of my poetry to you sometime." She says "I would love that." Then I use Major Mark's challenge line and Bishop's 
famous poetry invitation. She smiles really big and then looks disappointed and says "Oh I'm sorry, I can't tonight, I have plans, 
but let me give you my card and I will take your number, wait here." I take a seat next to the piano and chat up a nice lady who is 
sitting next to me waiting for someone. Lisa returns and I stand to meet her. She says "Here is my card. What is your phone 
number?" I tell her as she writes it on another card. She says "Can I call you?" I say "Yes, that would be nice." She shakes my 
hand again and I leave. 
Shortly after I arrive home the phone rings. I can tell from the caller ID that it is her. We start out with small talk. Then she gets 
into a long discussion about how she was so unhappy at the previous company. I let it go only long enough to get some of her 
trance words (feel, creative, deep, understand) and values and then steered it in the direction of her jewelry creations. She delights 
in telling me all about the shows her jewelry has been in and how she has orders that she has to fill tonight. I then steer it in the 
direction of the poetry. When I get the chance, I say "Would you like to hear one I have written?" She says "Yes, but I warn you, I 
have not eaten dinner yet and I don't want to pass out on you if it is a really good poem." I say "OK, just this one poem." Then I

recite Bro Nick Forturne's "Two Eyes." She says "Wow, that was beautiful." I say "You are so sweet, I am so glad you liked it." 
She says "I did, I am only telling the truth." Then the discussion starts going in the wrong direction and I pull it back. I say, not all 
of my poems have to rhyme, some of them are more free form. Would you like to hear one more?" She delightfully agrees and I 
recite Bishop's "The Sweetest Sound." There is a pause, and she says "Oh my God." I say "I am so glad you liked it." Then I say "I 
love how you can really feel my poetry Lisa." She says "Yes, I really feel it. Like it touches me so deeply. You write about 
feelings. How do you know so much about feelings?" I say "I am a student of the human mind. As electrical engineers, we looked 
to the human brain as an alternative computing architecture. While reading neurologist's papers, they quoted papers and studies 
done by psychologists. I became fascinated by the subject. Here is one experiment they talked about. Would you like to try it?" 
She is game, so I did the Blammo pattern. She had diagonal interference patterns so I helped her to adjust the control knob that 
tunes in a station to reduce interference. I say "But such a visual experiment just shows how you and I are kinesthetic people, we 
are feeling people, we are not visual like most other people." She says "Yes… (pause) I knew we were a lot alike." I say "Yes, we 
communicate in a different way, we FEEL." She says "Yes, so many people cannot understand that. They are intimidated by it 
because they do not understand it. But you understand it. Who are you? I feel as if I have known you for so long!" I say "I know, I 
feel that as well. I understand how you feel." She says "Do you talk like this to all the girls?" I say "I only say what I feel." She 
says "Oh, that is good!" Then I go into the IC pattern and she interrupts me many times to clarify and agree. She says "I want to 
give you a big hug right now." I say "Oh Lisa, I can feel that hug." Then I say "Talking about feelings, here is a poem about just 
that thing." I recite "Rose in Your Heart" from Mindlist. There is a very very long pause. Finally she says "I am speechless." I say 
"Good, I want you to be. I want you to feel understanding so deeply that not even words can describe it." She says "I… (pause) 
feel so closely to you David. Do you do this with all the girls?" I say "How can I Lisa? This is so rare what we have. We are both 
feeling people and we have communicated on such a deep level with our feelings." (All true.) She says "Yes… so true… (pause) 
this is scary. Are you scared?" I say "Yes Lisa, it is scary. I feel scared and excited at the same time." I then go into the Discovery 
Channel pattern. She says "I know something else that is like that." I laugh and then there is a long pause. She says "I don't know 
what to do?" 
I can hear Bishy telling me that she is asking me to help her to agree to meet. I do not have an anchor to fire off, but I do have 
words, so I say "I feel so closely to you Lisa. You have made me feel so vulnerable to you." She says "You have made me feel so 
open to you, so exposed." I say "Yes, that is it exactly. I need to see you Lisa." She says "When can we get together?" I say 
Monday night would be good. She says she has something that night, but Tuesday is good. I say I cannot meet Tuesday or 
Thursday but Wednesday is good. She cannot meet Wednesday but this next weekend is good. I tell her I cannot meet on the 
weekend. Stale mate. I feel that we have enough rapport that I can report to her that I am divorced and have two sons who I see 
every Tuesday and Thursday evening and every other weekend. She takes it well. I tell her about the boys and how they enjoy 
going on dates with me, and they talk the whole time to my date and I never get a word in edgewise. She likes it. She tells me 
about her two cats who are like her daughters. I say "It is so special to have that, knowing that your cats love you 
unconditionally." She says "Oh yes, they love me." Never did we get to the age question. She is probably 16 years younger than 
me. 
I say "It is too bad it will be at least a week before we can get together." She says "David, you have touched me on a different 
plane. It is as if you have touched me without even touching me." I say "Lisa, that is the nicest compliment anyone has given me 
in a very long time." She says "What do you want to do?" I know what she is asking me to do. I say "I want to be with you." She 
says "Those things you have to do tonight, do you have to do them?" I say "I can put them off." She says "I would like to meet 
you tonight." I say "I would like to meet you tonight." She says "I would like to meet with you privately, but I think it is best if we 
meet in a public place." I say "Oh I agree. As much as I would love to be alone with you, we need to meet where I can get to know 
who you really are, what your values are, who the real Lisa is." She is very happy with that. I say "OK, let's agree on a restaurant 
where you can finally have dinner." She says "I'm not hungry anymore." I laugh and say "Neither am I." She laughs. We agree on 
a coffee shop near her house and agree to meet there in 45 minutes. I tell her "Now Lisa, when you see me, I want you to give me 
that big hug you promised me." She says "Oh I will!" 
I arrive on time. She is not there yet. I find that it is full. None of the couches are available. There are a number of very attractive 
young ladies that I would love to approach, but I pass the time by chatting with the manager. The temperature in the late evening 
has dropped and it is very cool outside, but it is warm in the coffee shop. 
She arrives with a jacket and no glasses. She smiles and blushes. I put out my arms like I am expecting that big hug. She opens 
her arms wide and gives me the most delicious hug. I slide my hands under her jacket. I love how her slender firm body feels in 
my arms. Wow. Knowing that she is a kinesthetic person I whisper into her ear "You feel even better then you look." She holds

me even tighter. This goes on for about a minute. I notice that a couch becomes available so I let go and take her hand and lead 
her to our couch. 
We take a seat. She takes off her jacket. We are both smiling big and I sense that she is feeling a bit awkward. I hold her hand in 
mine and say "We will just relax here and allow ourselves to get used to being together again and allow ourselves to feel totally 
comfortable with each other." She likes it and says "It is getting warm in here." We laugh. I start with small talk about all we have 
been through so as to allow her to relive our relationship so far, backwards in time, which makes her feel very comfortable. Then 
the waitress comes and she orders some fancy French type of ice tea and I order a plain ice tea. 
When the drinks arrive I run Bishy's Ice Tea pattern. I am purposefully blatant with the embedded commands. She smiles and 
looks at me as if she knows what I am up to. We both laugh. More small talk while we are massaging each other's hands. She is a 
little nervous and holding my hands is her security blanket. She apologetically says "I have big hands for a woman." (I thought 
they were very feminine actually.) I say "Well you know what that would mean if you were a man?" She laughs and says "Oh but 
that is not always true." I say "Might not, but its sheer size is not what is important, but the way each other makes the other feel 
while making love." She says "Oh so true." 
She holds her hands just a fraction of an inch from either side of mine and says "Did you know that you can feel the energy 
between two people?" I say "I can feel that Lisa." 
I compliment her on her beautiful eyes. She says "Your eyes are very playful. You have a playfulness about you." I say "I think 
that is what it is all about. Why do it if it cannot be fun. It should be playful." 
She says "Even when I first looked into your eyes, I felt as if I had always known you." I used this to go into the IC pattern again, 
but this time to plant that famous anchor on the solar plexus. She accepted it and actually liked it. 
She asks me where I get the inspiration to write such beautiful poetry. I say "When I am alone, I think about how it would feel to 
not be alone, what it would be like, how it would feel, what we would do." Then I ask her "Do you know how it feels to be 
alone?" She replies "Oh yes." I say "Do you feel alone now?" She says "Oh no." I say "This feeling, that you are feeling now, (I 
fire off top of wrist anchor) how would you describe it? How would you describe the opposite of alone?" She looks at me for a 
while and says "Embraced." I say "That is the perfect word for it, embraced." Then I say to her "Now, we are together, as if we 
have always meant to have met, and that reminds me of a story I once heard. A story about soul friends." She says "Friends? You 
mean soul mates?" She seemed kind of disappointed. I know that I will later have to "manage her relationship expectations." I say 
"Soul friends, like we have always known each other." Then I go into the Soul Friends pattern. I anchor her childhood time with 
me with a touch on the inside of her arm just above the wrist. Then the present a little higher than that, and the future a little 
higher than that. Then I say "And now you can feel that we have always been together" as I slide my finger from her wrist up, and 
even higher as I say "And it just keeps feeling better and better." She closes her eyes for a moment and then looks at me and says 
"I am in a trance." 
I just let her look into my eyes for a while. Then I look at her lips and she looks at my lips. Then I say "You know that you can 
feel a first kiss even before it happens?" I go into the first kiss pattern. She licks her lips. I then say "and talking about 
anticipation, have you ever thought of the difference between anticipation and compulsion?" She disclosed that she once had a 
compulsion for Godiva white chocolate clams. They are sweet, smooth, and silky. This was the perfect intro to the BJ pattern. She 
loved that! 
Then I said "I brought with me a poem that I wanted to read to you." She looked wide eyed at me and said "Oh no!" as if "Are you 
going to make me even hotter?" I take out of my pocket three pages that I printed out before driving to the coffee shop. I then look 
at her and her head is rested on the back of the couch in preparation for being read to. I then recite Bishop's "Lover's Dance." She 
sighs and says "I saw all the visuals. I felt as if we were really there. Like two lovers sharing that gift that nature has given us to 
share together. David, you make me feel so deeply. I wish that there were a way that I could make you feel so deeply." hmmm… 
Then I say "Speaking about gifts, I have written about just such a gift. I would like to read it to you now." She looks at the ceiling 
and then rolls her head towards me and says "Yes." I recite Bishop's "Warm and fuzzy." When I am done she looks straight ahead 
and she begins to cry. She says "I am crying. David, you have made me feel so deeply. Sometimes I feel so deeply that it hurts." I 
sense that this will be a problem later. I should have addressed it right then. I hold her closely. We look deeply into each other's 
eyes.

I know at this time I must "manage her relationship expectations." I say "Lisa, as you know, we are both very busy people. We 
had a hard time finding this evening to be together. It will be at least a week before we see each other again. My schedule has 
always served to raise havoc with a relationship." She says "How can you do that? How can you do a take away like that?" I say 
"Lisa, too many times in my past, my schedule has only served to ruin a good thing. I want to be totally honest with you." She 
said "Well, I know that in some of my previous relationships, I have gotten too involved with someone at the expense of the other 
things in my life that I cherish, and I have ended up mad at myself for doing that. I am a busy person. Yes, I do understand." I said 
"Lisa, before, I have gone into relationships and not been totally honest before it goes too far, maybe in order that we will have 
sex, I don't know. But I am too mature now to mess with anybody's feelings. Feelings are just too precious." She says "Yes, 
David, that is so true. I do thank you for being honest with me. I guess I don't really want someone to be with me all the time, I 
just want someone who I can share with, who I can call, someone who really cares about me." I say "I want nothing more than for 
us to be totally honest with each other." 
The waitress comes by and says it is last call. We decline. Perfect timing. I say "It is late and we must go home. I will drive you to 
your car. When we get to my car, I have a poem in my car that I want to read to you." She delightfully says "OK!" pheeew, good. 
I thought I might have lost her there. 
We hold hands as we walk to my car. Her stride is as long as mine and we are walking in step. She wants to do the "Monkey's 
walk" where they walk in front of each other's foot. We sing the theme song from the Monkey's. 
I unlock the passenger door and hold it as she gets in. I get in the driver's side and find that she is sitting with her legs under her, 
while facing me. Ross tells us in the BHSC that this is a very good sign. She is cold so I warm up the car. I tell her "I have even 
written poetry for lady friends of mine to read to their boyfriends. Here are two poems that I have written. Remember, these are 
from a woman's point of view." She is wide eyed and ready. I recite the two poems. She stares at me and says "David, how have 
you described exactly how I feel?" I say "Because it is how I feel. It is how I want you to feel." She says "I want to take you home 
with me, but... it's too soon." I say "I completely understand and I respect your decision. Even though we feel as if we have known 
each other our whole lives, we mustn't move too fast. We don't want to think about how incredible it would be." She says "You're 
not helping any!" I laugh and say "I will drive you to your car now." We navigate to her car in a nearby well lit parking lot 
frequented by cops, so I do not want anything to happen in the car. We sit in my car. 
She says that it is getting hot now. I turn down the heat and she takes off her coat. She rests her head sideways on the head rest 
and looks at me. I look at her lips and lick my lips. She leans forward and goes into the actual slow sensual real life enactment of 
the first kiss. I play my part well. It is awesome. It gets more heated and passionate. Next thing we are licking each other's tonsils. 
Then I lick her lips as if they were her "other" lips. This sends her into orbit. Then she complains that she is hot. I turn on the 
damn air conditioning. She complains again and says that she wants to remove her clothing. Then she says "No, how does this 
seat go back?" I recline her seat and she pulls me onto her. Then she says "David, I have been hurt so many times." Oh shit, here it 
comes. I should have addressed this before. She talks about the men in her life who dated her and dumped her and then came back 
just wanting sex again. I say "That type of behavior makes me angry because just because I am a man, I am included in such a 
group. That is just the kind of thing I was talking about before. It is only human to be honest with somebody and to really care 
about someone" and I slide my finger up the inside of her arm to fire off the soul friends anchor and say "as you can feel that 
about me." She says "I know, it isn't fair, it is not you." 
Then she instructs me to recline my seat. She climbs on top of me and more cuddling and kissing occurs. She says breathlessly 
"No don't" but continues nonetheless. hmmm... She says "I want you David. I want to take you home with me. But… I am on my 
menstrual cycle now." I say "Are you self conscious about that?" She says "Well, yes, in the early part of a relationship I am." I 
say "Lisa, I love everything about you that defines you as feminine, everything. I am very accepting of it all." She says "You are 
so wonderful David. I wish I could do this." I point at her solar plexus and say "I only want you to do what you feel inside here." 
She slides her head down my stomach and onto my lap. She reaches for my zipper. All I can think about is the flashlight of a cop. 
I say "Lisa, I want this, but I want this in the privacy of your bedroom, where I can feel your body against mine. Where I can feel 
all of your skin." She rests for a few seconds and then raises up and lies back on her reclined seat and pulls me onto her. She starts 
massaging her breasts and says "David, look at what you do to me, you make me fondle myself." I say "That is very exciting for 
me." (very true) I go for broke and I say "Lisa, what do you want me to do. Do you want to me just tell you 'Lisa, take me home 
with you now'?" She softly says "no." I do not partake in anymore playtime unless she wants to play at home. We rest in each 
other's arms. I am not going to push it any further. I do not want to loose any respect she already has for me now and I do not want 
to mess with her feelings. She says "I am not going to get any sleep tonight." I am done jumping hurtles so I say "It is late. We

better go home." We kiss softly and we both know the night is over. We set our seats up straight and we fix our clothing. I get out 
and go to her door and open her door. A cop drives by very slowly watching us like a hawk. I say to her "The cops are out 
patrolling lover's lane." She laughs. She puts her coat in her car and turns to me. She says "I have a feeling I will be thinking about 
you a lot." I say "And I will of you." We embrace and kiss one last time. 
Lisa and I talk on the phone each day over the next 3 days. She mentions in one conversation that she had an operation for 
endometriosis. She mentions that during her period it causes intercourse to be very uncomfortable. THAT'S WHY! It is a good 
thing I did not try to push anything. I read to her Bishop's "Rain of Desire." She absolutely loves it and asks for a copy of it. I tell 
her I will bring it to her when I see her again. 
Our busy schedules keep us apart. But late Thursday night we make some time and she gives me directions to her place so I can 
pick her up to take her out for a cup of coffee. I print off Bishop's "Rain of Desire" and head out. It is a very warm evening this 
time. When I arrive she opens the door and opens her arms for a big hug. I step inside and close the door behind me. She hugs me 
very closely. We say nothing. This hug goes on for almost 5 minutes. I finally whisper into her ear "You feel so good." We start 
grinding a little. Then I say "I have the feeling that you would prefer to just sit on the couch and talk here." She says "Yes, let's 
do." We take a seat on the couch. I can tell she is very comfortable. I fire off the Soul Friends anchor and then I hold my hand just 
a fraction of an inch from her skin and start moving my hand up and down her arm as if to transfer energy to her, as she had done 
to me. I talk about the energy between two people. She says "Your voice just mesmerizes me." 
She slides us along the back of the couch to rest against the arm of the couch. Serious kissing ensues followed by heavy petting. 
Eventually we are horizontal. Her air conditioning is wholly inadequate and I am starting to perspire. She suggests that I remove 
my shirt. No problem. Petting continues. She complains of being hot and removes her shirt. ok… In time, more articles of clothing 
are removed in the interest of comfort. She must not be on her period anymore. I ask her "Would it be cooler in your bedroom?" 
She says "Yes, I have a fan in there." We make our way to her canopy bed. Here the final articles of clothing are removed and I 
spend a great deal of time adoring her lovely soft ivory skin, flat hard stomach, and narrow hips. This woman still has the body of 
a girl. We cuddle for a while and she says "This is too soon." I say "Yes, it is. We will just enjoy holding each other." Then she 
starts fondling herself and says "David, do you like watching me?" I say "That is very exciting for me." She sees that it is and she 
reaches into her night stand and rips open a condom and together we "plant the big anchor." 
Eventually it is very late and I have to work the next day. Before I leave we make plans for a date for dinner on Saturday. Why? 
Because, DATES ARE FOR WOMEN YOU ARE ALREADY SLEEPING WITH!

The Eyes patterns
Back to the Table of Contents
Pattern I 
(by John Casewest) 
"Has anyone ever told you that you have the most interesting eyes?  
They have a quality about them that says "there's more to this person than you might think at first glance". 
(This works GREAT on women that are VERY beautiful and hear it all. You might also want to open with something like "Any 
idiot can look at you and tell you that you are beautiful but it takes a ________ and a ________ (list your good qualities) man to 
see, that [then go into your pattern]. This is a TOTAL break state!) 
Have you ever met someone with that look in there that just said "underneath this person's gotta be someone exciting and riveting" 
and you just have to get to know this person (sp) better. Or maybe it was like you could look so deep into their eyes and they just 
fascinated you (ambiguity) because you couldn't quite place it but they just looked somehow so familiar. With me I have to 
*follow that feeling* when there's someone right in front of me with eyes like that. 
(Next piece could be used in any cold walk up, both to challenge them and get them comfortable) 
Most people are a little too scared to just approach someone they feel the urge to meet, and I know it can take courage to meet 
someone just because you want to see if they’re the kind of person you might really want to spend time with, but I know I’m 
(flattered, respect or a trance word) when someone has the initiative and (chuckle tonality) good sense to go out of her way to get 
to know me!" 
Pattern II 
(by John Casewest) 
Has anyone ever told you that you have the most interesting eyes? 
You know I know a few people with eyes like yours and I’ve found people with eyes like that tend to be exciting and riveting 
people, like that glow isn’t just right there but in their whole personality as well… 
It’s like as if when you look into someone’s eyes, you can just see the whole way into them, and *feel so comfortable. With me*, 
it’s even more exciting (count the commands there) though, the different things people can say with their eyes - eyes can also 
show deep understanding, and whether you’re paying close attention to something or what’s going on deep inside you. 
It’s amazing the things people’s eyes can tell, it’s like as if you can see a sense of humor right there in someone, or when the eyes 
are mysterious or sometimes just really intriguing, that just make you want to find out more of what’s going on behind them. 
Aren’t eyes just most fascinating..."

I Want You pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
(Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...":) 
After some initial fluff talk: first look straight into her eyes and then discreetly whisper this pattern in her ear, allowing her to feel 
your warm breath on the side of her neck below her ears, squeezing her hands firmly yet ever so gently at the same time. Even if 
she will put up some resistance on the surface, you can bet that she is totally melting from the inside. 
"I want you despite the fact that we've only known each other very shortly. I want us to be that loving couple walking barefoot on 
the beach holding hands right on the edge of the ocean where only the more lingering waves can reach, gently caressing our feet. 
The sky is fiery red on the horizon as the sun is ever so graciously going down, plunging into the warmth of the loving sea. A light 
breeze gently whispers in our ears as we look into each other's eyes. We can both feel the heat of our passion as our hearts beat in 
unison, but we hold back until the feeling intensifies past the point of our futile resistance. In a fury of emotions my thoughts 
deeply penetrate your mind making your attention slowly move back and forth, over and over, from pure love to raw animal 
instinct and lust, as you come and come again to the same conclusion that you must surrender your entire being to the sheer power 
of our passion that is sweeping us both away into a world of feeling complete. Then comes our first kiss... 
Update (modified from Ross Jeffries' www.introme.com) ...that first, soft brush of the lips so soft you're not even sure you're 
kissing yet, and it's as if all the passion... all the fire that will be experienced in the relationship is enfolded in that one, first, soft, 
special kiss, just waiting to be explored and made real. It's that moment where time stands still and yet in that one moment, there 
is an eternity of experience to be explored as the dreams of a lifetime of love explode in you in this moment of passion and 
fulfillment... It makes your knees weak and your heart soar and every part of you comes... alive... awakened... ready for whatever 
will come next. I want you (insert name here)." 
And without any hesitation you kiss her on the lips. If she's right into it, the kiss will be a very passionate one. If she's still in 
shock you can just steal an innocent kiss without making a big deal about it. It might take her a while to get out of that 
mesmerized state before she will allow herself to act on her own feelings, but when she does - the result will be more passionate 
kissing.

At Least We Can Be Friends pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Estonian translation 
Can you make her first consider and then _want_ the opposite?:) 
Ross Jeffries: 
"I don't know if you'd find me really attractive or that I might be somebody that you can feel really close to... because it doesn't 
happen with just anyone... you know what I mean don't you? That feeling of closeness that allows you to let go and really be with 
someone... I'm not sure we could have that... But we might have fun finding out and the very least we might be friends... But it is 
nice isn't it? I mean when that does happen and you find yourself having all those feelings... inside. You know how that feels don't 
you? I mean when was the last time you felt that way? Really intense... inside... and down below… and as you think about it have 
you noticed you can get some of those feelings back now! But you know I find you really attractive but I don't want you to sleep 
with me... I'm not even going to ask you... because its your decision... and any way I'm not sure you can make me want you... but 
its nice to think about it isn't it? And I'm sure you'll find what you really want... eventually but until then we can have some kind 
of closeness… because I don't want to sleep with anyone who doesn't really want to sleep with me... 100%. But we can be friends 
can't we?"

Indifference to Attraction pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Partial Estonian translation 
Try these, if you're dying to make love to a female friend of yours:) 
Pattern I. Ross Jeffries: 
"Have you ever looked at somebody (sp) and seen her in a completely new light? Maybe even someone, who you never thought 
you could even like (sp, if you don't know her very well or she exhibits signs of indifference for you, otherwise point away from 
yourself), or maybe it was just a friend or acquaintance of yours (sp, if this is the case), but for some inexplicable reason you start 
finding him attractive. You start to think, how much fun it would be for the two or you to be together. You imagine yourself with 
him (sp) having the time of your life. And slowly you start to forget, what you used to think about this person before and just let 
go with all these new and fantastic feelings you're experiencing. 
Like my friend Christina was telling me, that's how she met her boyfriend. They used to go to the same lectures/meetings/office, 
but he never thought much of the guy, he was just there and that was it. Then suddenly she started feeling drawn and attracted to 
him. And now she thinks he is the best guy she's ever been with. She told me he makes her feel… mmm… that kind of a feeling, 
deep inside (touch solar plexus:)" 
Pattern II. Ross Jeffries: 
"Have you ever been attracted to someone who wasn't even your type physically? 
Like I have this friend Nancy. And when I met Nancy, I didn't think she was that appealing. I had little feelings for her 
whatsoever. But then when I started to get to know her, I started to notice certain things, like the first thing I noticed is that she 
has an absolutely great sense of humor. I mean have you ever been around someone who makes you laugh so much, just the 
minute you see them you're already waiting to laugh, like all they have to do is look at you and you bust out laughing. 
The other thing I noticed about her is that she really likes herself, I mean her attitude was, hey, being with me is the best thing that 
could possibly happen to you, you had better take advantage of it right now before that chance slips away forever. 
Then one day, I found myself looking through a new set of eyes. You ever look at someone(pt) through a new set of eyes. Its like 
I look inside and, OH MY GOD, when I look at her like that, this person is really beautiful. 
I think when that happens to someone (point to her) with me in my way of thinking what I think happens is when you go inside 
yourself, and you find those values that are most important to you in a relationship and you think about the qualities in a 
personality you want your ideal lover to have and then you just find those and link them up with the person you're talking to (self-
point), in such a way that you begin to think things differently, you then start to look through the eyes of attraction, cause I think 
when you look through the eyes of attraction, look through the eyes of desire, that's when you can make that connection, and 
really feel that growing.

How to Lay Girls Guide
Now that whole process can take weeks, even months of getting to know someone. But I think the real wonder is to find yourself 
really wondering what would it be like to surrender to the magic of that instantaneously and make that connection . . now and 
really feel that attraction to someone (sp). Wouldn't that be great? Isn't it just great to experience that and let it happen?" 
Update. Pattern III. From an unknown source: 
"Have you ever known someone who you weren't really attracted to but then, for some mysterious reason, you just suddenly 
found that you started to THINK THINGS DIFFERENTLY and SEE THEM IN A WHOLE NEW WAY, AS REALLY HORNY 
AND GORGEOUS?" 
"I mean, I think sometimes people really don't know what they want, at least consciously... but then it's like YOUR CONSCIOUS 
MIND DIVES DOWN (gesture action) into your subconsciousness, and just (gesture action) BRINGS BACK UP ALL THOSE 
DESIRES AND IMAGES AND FEELINGS INTO YOUR MIND." 
"I mean, like my neighbour looked at me a couple days ago, and right out of the blue she took me by the hands (take her by the 
hands) and says "Can you IMAGINE IF WE WERE KISSING, and I was touching you where and how you love to be touched, 
kissing the way you want, and you were starting to FEEL INCREDBLY TURNED ON, so hot and turned on you like you have 
never been turned on before, up to the point where you simply had to have me?" 
"Can you believe she said that? Well, I was totally shocked and just managed to spit out "Yes!". Although actually, I should had 
played back and said "Can YOU imagine ME going down on you, MY TONGUE RUNNING DOWN YOUR THIGHS, 
SLIPPING DEEP INTO YOU MAKING YOU SO HOT AND WET. Now, can YOU feel that pleasure just building, pulsing and 
throbbing all through your body? Can you IMAGINE THAT FEELING, can you FEEL THAT RIGHT NOW? (squeeze her hands 
- plant an anchor) Can you SEE ALL THOSE IMAGES OF GOOD LOVING, big and bright, really turning you on?" 
Note: This might be all that it takes - just fire off the anchor and get in there - or if you feel you need more: 
"Well that really got me so turned on. Now I feel that the experience of someone starting to FEEL UNBELIVABLY TURNED 
ON has a structure and a sequence to it. Like for some people, first they REALLY FEEL THOSE FEELINGS (fire anchor) and 
then they start to SEE THOSE INCREDIBLE IMAGES. And other people SEE THOSE IMAGES OF BURNING SEX first, and 
then they GET THOSE TURNED ON FEELINGS. I mean, when I SEE THOSE IMAGES, mine are moving. Are your images 
moving or still images?" 
(Her: xxx) 
"Right. I've found that the image and feelings sometimes bleed together... so as the IMAGES GET BRIGHTER AND BIGGER 
the FEELINGS can REALLY INTENSIFY, so they're just radiating and pulsing all through your body, and that MAKES THE 
PICTURES BIGGER, which MAKES THE FEELING MORE INTENSE, till you can sometimes just LOSE CONTROL 
COMPLETELEY and GO WILD WITH DESIRE!!!"

Find That Girl pattern

This is a good one to use if she is bitter, down and thinks all men are scum. 
Ross Jeffries: "Where is the girl that lived in your mind? Remember the little one; the one that believed in love? Maybe she 
dreamed of that ideal man she'd one day give her heart to, and she knew at that moment she dreamt of him, she had already fallen 
in love. And each day, each moment of her life, she carried that love with her in her heart, waiting for the day when it could be 
released; released and given to the one who was worthy.(Point to yourself). What would it be like to realise that after all the 
sorrow and tears... that person had come along?(point to yourself) If you were to LOOK for that girl within your heart and mind...

Blow Job pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
Pattern I 
Kevin Kupal, mindlist: "Basically, it's a 3-step procedure. 
1. Ask her about anything she really really loves to eat
2. Describe the sensation of eating that food and amplify with gustatory gusto
3. Link it to your dick using a "dick point".
Let's put flesh into it? Sure. 
Me : Hey Alicia. What do you love to eat ? Something that really makes you salivate just by thinking of it ? 
Alicia : Oh... I love fresh ripe mangoes from Hawaii / strawberries from Ohio... oh yes... 
Me: Ripe mangoes huh? Mmmm....that's yummy. I don't know if you can IMAGINE... SUCKING into one sweet, delicious, juicy 
mango NOW... mmm... can you taste the sweetness of the mango... swishing INSIDE YOUR MOUTH... mmm... soo tasty... 
doesn't that give you lots of pleasure and ha-PENIS just thinking about that? Mmm... I bet, if there were a mango here NOW, 
you'd WANT IT IN YOUR MOUTH (point to dickee!). 
Hehehe... this pattern makes me salivate myself... hope I don't go looking for... (gasp)" 
Update. Pattern II. Here's the "real" BJ pattern:) Ross Jeffries: 
"I was just sitting here thinking about taking a vacation, if you could imagine your ideal vacation spot what would it be like? 
(Stop and let her talk) 
You know, I think its so interesting how people connect with their hopes and their desires and their daydreams, right? ... I was 
reading this article the other day about compulsions and it got me to thinking about the difference between compulsion and 
anticipation. 
I mean, have you ever come home from a hard day of work and the boss was a jerk and kept piling the papers up on you desk and 
its like all you can think of is dropping your clothes and getting into that steamy hot bath or shower. 
Its like before you even step in you can already feel that heat working its way through every muscle in your body and all your 
frustrations just drop away and all you can feel is the pleasure of that warmth just shooting through every part of you. 
And then there's that moment of sliding in where you really let that pleasure take you and it just feels great doesn't it? 
Yeah well, do you like chocolate? (Or is there a food that when you see it you absolutely have to put it in your mouth?). I mean, 
can you stop and remember a time when you saw a piece of chocolate and your mouth is already tasting it before you even put it 
in, and you can already taste that sweetness against your tongue and you can feel the special rich texture of it against your tongue 
as well. You know that texture that really good chocolate has. 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/p_blow.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:35:06 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
And then there's that moment, that moment when the first molecule of chocolate touches your tongue and you know it's inside 
your mouth and you just want to keep it there because it's so rich and so good. And there's that extra special warmth when you 
swallow that sweetness down. 
Or then maybe, you know like sometimes you meet someone and you're really attracted to them and you both know it and there's 
that moment when your eyes lock, it's that special look just before you kiss, just before you do it the very first time and you're 
trembling with anticipation and your heart is pounding because you're thinking about how good it's going to be. 
It's like every physical moment of that relationship is enfolded/contained or rolled into that first touch of the lips and there's that 
excitement, with that first soft contact of the lips where you don't even know if you are touching or not but then, oh man, it's like a 
jolt of electricity all through you. 
(See I think what happens is the conscious mind goes down into the subconscious and brings back up all these thoughts, images, 
desires and fantasies, and you may think those thoughts are above me, but really I think they're blow me _____ because you're 
coming from a much deeper part and your mine aren't you?)" 
Update. Pattern III. Freeqshow, Clifford's Seduction Newsletter: 
"Here's an email I have used to great success: 
"Your notes are sooooooo sweet, I could just... well, you know what I could just do. Anyways, I so enjoyed talking to you today. 
Time just seems to fly by doesn't it? 
So I was thinking, is there some fruit that you just can't wait to put in your mouth? Like if you were to think about it, you could 
just feel how the skin would taste on your lips, and as you took that first delicious bite you could just imagine how soft and tender 
it feels as it slips past your lips and begins to caress your tongue with a hundred flavors that you just can't wait to have. And as 
that nectar started to flow, to the point where your mouth became filled with all those sweet warm juices that you love so much, 
you just knew you would die if you spilled even one drop. I don't know about you, but I think about things like this all the time. 
You know, all this has got me thinking... you ever have one of those Sugar Daddy's. You know, that caramel candy on a stick that 
takes all day to eat. You know I think that thing is about six inches long when you first unwrap it but the more you nibble on it 
and suck it deep inside your mouth and just let your tongue do it's work...eventually you come to the point where it's real soft and 
you know that's just about the best thing you ever had in your mouth and you just feel all that hot warm gooey candy just slide 
down your throat and when you're all finished you just let out a little sigh of ecstasy because it was so good and you know you can 
always have one when you really want it. You know?"

Backdoor Pleasure patterns
Back to the Table of Contents
A completely hilarious collection of patterns by Rod Munch to get her to submit to and enjoy anal sex:) Unbelieveable, I almost 
laughed my ass off (whoops?:) the first time I read them:) Rod Munch, mindlist: 
Pattern I 
Purpose: To implant the idea of receiving pleasure from her ass.
Subject: Your Friend (who else?) Rod 
Did I ever tell you about my friend Rod?  Well, he's a damn cool guy, but he got a new job.  Yeah, he's on the R&D team of some 
furniture company, (make up a name, Muncher Furniture perhaps?).  Yeah, well he's working on a team and their job is to design 
the perfect chair.  Did you ever have a favorite chair?  (of course she sez yes)  What was it like? I have to ask this stuff, maybe I 
can give Rod some ideas.  (let her talk about the perfect chair).  Feed her info back to her in the following part: Yeah, I know what 
you mean.  Isn't it great how you can have a favorite seat, and after a hard, stressful day at work, you LOOK FORWARD TO 
PLOPPING YOUR ASS/BUTT DOWN on that seat (point to schlong). And then you get there and you see that seat (point to 
schlong) and you can already start to RELAX and FEEL SO GOOD just thinking about how great it will feel when you LOWER 
YOUR ASS ONTO THAT SEAT (point to schlong!!!) and think how great it will be to slowly SLIDE DOWN ONTO IT (point to 
schlong!!!). 
Pattern II 
Purpose: To program her with not only anal pleasure, but sexually oriented anal pleasure
Subject: Life's Little Surprises 
Do you like surprises?  I think it's great how the best things in life are unexpected.  What was the best surprise you've ever 
gotten?  And I'm not talking about a gift necesarrily, I mean just something that happened that was so good, but was totally

(Let her talk, get her in state) 
Yeah, I can totally hear/feel/see what you mean.  Isn't it just great how the things in life that just sneak up behind you 
unexpectedly?  I mean, there are things you know are coming and you can see them, like, "Oh, it's Friday, I'm getting paid today."  
Now that's in front of you, in your future, but then the best things in life, the ones that can make you FEEL FULFILLED and 
FEEL SO GOOD FROM YOUR BOTTOM to your top have a tendency to sneak up behind you and COME FROM YOUR 
REAR.  And INSIDE YOU ASS yourself, "This is so great!  How can something this great (point to schlong) just take me from 
behind and surprise me like this?"  I mean, that facinates me, take a second and think about how the greatest things (point to 
schlong) you have ever felt took you from the rear...think about that.  It's sexually facinating if you really THINK ABOUT IT and 
TAKE IT ALL IN ANALlytically. 
You know what else in interesting?  Is how simple words that I say can make you feel so good. (remember you have been SSing 
her for a while by now).  It's like you feel these things (point to schlong) COMING IN YOUR REAR, ENTERING YOUR

REAR, being whispered to you, and it can make you feel so good.  Don't you find that when I talk like that, when I DO IT, you 
can't resist and you just OPEN YOUR REAR and LET IT SLIDE INSIDE YOU, hearing those words and feeling so wonderful? 
Pattern III 
You know, I have this other friend, Rod, isn't it funny how I can have so many friends named Rod? 
At any rate, he owns this dingy little steakhouse on the other side of town, called "Rod's Meat."  Anyways I was talking to his 
wife the other day over some drinks and she is kind of the manager of the place.  But she was telling me how terrible her job 
was...so routine, so boring.  Everyweek she counts the money, writes the paychecks to the employees and supervises the food 
shipments.  Well, she was saying that her job was getting so boring, that she couldn't take it anymore. 
Well, she got some relief one week when the meat shipment came in, and it was bigger than usual, and she couldn't get it the same 
way she had been.  She had to totally change the process, and she told me, "Sometimes you have to BREAK ROUTINE, and DO 
IT DIFFERENTLY."  She said that she had to get the meat in the backdoor, where she had never gotten it before, and you know 
it's funny, but that little break with routine, something as simple as when you GET THE MEAT (point to schlong) IN THE 
BACKDOOR, can make you FEEL SO GOOD. 
Course, it was a little harder for her at first, since she had never done it that way before, but once she got started, and past the first 
part of it, as the process went on, she felt so good to have done it differently.

The Void pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
By Kevin Kupal. Mindlist: 
"Doesn't it sometimes make you stop and think how some people, despite having everything, just feel lonely and empty and 
severely lacking? Well, I was reading about the life and times of John Belushi... he had it all... the fame, the fortune, the houses... 
the women... but it appears that he was just so lonely. So was Marilyn Monroe... on top of the world, with millions of men 
swooning over her...she just felt so alone and left out. 
I think it's really a common thing. Like, lots of people (point to her) just go on living from one day to the next like a robot... 
perhaps getting amused, perhaps feeling some sort of achievement, but deep inside, there's this hole inside them (point to her 
chest)... empty... hollow. It's like, you ask yourself, "Is this it? Is this what I've been living for? This is it?" 
I think that people, Jenny, are looking for that elusive "IT"... to fill the deep void and emptiness inside them... whatever that is, it's 
the one thing that will just make you feel a sense of wholeness, of completeness... of peace... ha-penis... 
And when you have it, when it's right in front of you (you're in front of course), only then can you begin to feel that wholeness 
and peace... or perhaps... that ecsatic, filling delight... filling you up completely... making every pore of your body ooze with 
delicious, ecsatic pleasure... that's when you know that you've found that part of you that was missing all along (point to self). You 
are happy and complete. 
But whatever that ha-penis (point to self) is, it's elusive... you'll have to GO FOR IT (point to self) once you find the slightest 
chance... the slightest window of opportunity... you'll have to GRAB IT. Or... it could slip away and you might just find it gone... 
and you'll be left only with the thoughts of what could have been... the stuff that regrets are made of. 
So...when you find your ha-penis right in front of you... Grab it! Right away!"

The Door pattern
Back to the Table of Contents
This one is the "bad boy" of all patterns. Anyone who has studied SS and NLP and has come into contact with the Door pattern, 
has found it to be evil and cruel, playing on the fears and deep insecurities of women. To give you an idea of how bad this pattern 
actually is - even Ross Jeffries himself has denounced this pattern and says that he does NOT encourage anyone to use it. 
So... as always with stuff like that... "for educational purpose only":) 
The Door pattern originated by Alex Domnikov. Mindlist: 
"Whereas most patterns are about getting a woman into bed, The Door is aimed at controlling her after you've started sleeping 
with her. Other patterns that you've used on her have anchored immense pleasure to you. The Door creates an anchor for the loss 
of that pleasure. 
You've already had intercourse with the girl. The ideal setting for the power of the door, which is a power and control pattern, is 
right after you've had intercourse and you're in bed with the girl, and at this time hopefully you've set up the fact that you're also 
the man of her dreams and fulfil her emotional needs. You're fooling around in bed, you've already had a great time, and you go, 
"sweetheart, what's that over there?" and you point towards the door. And she'll say, "well you know, that's a door, silly." And you 
say, "yeah, you know.. I'm a real positive person, but.. I mean, can you imagine.. I mean, you don't know what can happen from 
day to day, when you think about it in your mind. I mean, what would happen if I walked out that door and the door closed and as 
the door closed, it slammed shut, and no matter what you did, you could not open the door and you knew that you would never be 
able to look into my eyes again and you'd never be able to hear my voice again and you'd never be able to feel my touch again." 
Ok, right here is where she starts going, "I don't like this door business at all." And at this time you just reassure her.. "ok, alright 
sweetheart, you're right. You really shouldn't think about the door and you really don't have to think about the door." So you go 
back to playing around with her some more. Have some more fun with her, bring her to another orgasm or whatever and say, "you 
know, a terrible thing happened the other day. My friend was hit by a truck. I mean, it was awful, by the time they got him to 
hospital he was dead. I can't believe it, you know? It's almost as if, it would be a horrible thing you know when you think about.." 
(point towards the door) "..that no matter even if you were to get that door opened and you were to search, that you could never 
find me again.." Then she starts freaking out. You calibrate more on that part of, "you will never be able to see me again, you'll 
never be able to hear my voice again." 
"You'll never be able.. all that fun we had together, all those great times we had together, walking along the beach, hand in hand in 
the moonlight, we would never be able to do those things again and even if you were to open that door, you would search and you 
could never find." And she's at the point where she's saying, "no no I hate this door. Let's stop this door now, are you trying to 
upset me?" And you say, "oh, I'm sorry sweetheart, I'm just saying these are just things that are popping into my mind, ok?" So 
play around some more. Get her good and nice and hot again, fool around, have a good time with her, joke, and then then get back 
into the door and say, "you know, God, still you know, about life's tragedies.. I mean, I just keep on thinking how.." At this point 
you can already see that this is starting to make her feel uncomfortable. You want to create that sense in her that you can walk out 
and she'll feel terrible for the rest of here life. You want to anchor that response. I'll get up and she'll say, "well what are you 
doing?" And I'll say, "I'm going to the bathroom." I go up to the bedroom door and slam it. That right there will freak her out. 
Then I'll open the door and say, "oh, I'm sorry. You know, I'm sorry, I'm just playing with this door again. You know, you really 
shouldn't think about this door now and you really don't want to think about this door now."

How to Lay Girls Guide
Having anchored that sense of loss and pain to the door, you can trigger it whenever needed. Whatever negative behavior may 
come up that you want to stop, the first time you just get up and slam the door. Whether you walk out the door depends on the 
level of bullshit. On later occasions you can just indicate tbe door in some manner. The example Alex gives: If he's talking on the 
phone and getting any crap from her, and he knows the relation of where the door is to her desk, he says, "sweetheart, could you 
please turn right and take a look at what's over there.." and that was the end of the bullshit."

Become your own "friend" for her
Back to the Table of Contents
Introduction to long-distance seduction 
Although this guide has so far pretty much avoided the topic of long-distance seductions as it is the belief of the author that the 
ability to perform on the field is what ultimately makes or brakes a seducer, such techniques are important tools for many 
nevertheless. The ability to perform long-distance becomes handy mostly due to various time or space constraints when you can 
not have face-to-face interactions, but as an added bonus it can sometimes even prove to be more efficient than a direct approach 
could or would have been (don't count on it though, just keep it in mind when forced to go long-distace to keep you in good 
spirits:). Actually, most of the suggestions in this guide can actually be incorporated into a long-distance seduction without too 
much hassle anyway, but in addition to that you'll find a few more long-distance specific techniques in this section of the guide. 
Become your own "friend" for her 
By Kent "Klorm" Sayre, Mindlist: 
"Hi all! I've got a technique for you that helps get the initial response when responding to email personal ads. I designed it for my 
friend and then realized that one person could use it. Essentially, I answer a woman's personal ad on behalf of my friend. As we 
all know, someone speaking highly of you is of course more persuasive than you tooting your own horn. Here's an example 
message I've been sending on behalf of my friend and he's been getting a good number of responses. 
**EXAMPLE MESSAGE**
Hi there. I'm responding to your AOL profile on behalf of my friend Mark. I hear him saying about the women he dates and the 
games that they play and how he has had enough of it. He's looking for an honest, no-games-playing woman who likes to have 
fun. So, being his good friend, I thought I'd do him this favor of replying because you seem like you'd be a good match for him. 
Now stop for a moment, as you sit there, looking at the screen, reading my message, and imagine what it would be like to *enjoy 
yourself* out with a guy who is intelligent, funny, good-looking, athletic, educated, and financially successful. While you imagine 
that guy, you might become aware that the guy I'm having you imagine is my friend Mark. Naturally, you might now wonder how 
you can *contact him*. And that's why I'm here. When you email Mark, tell him his good friend Kent said you two appear to be 
an obvious match. His email is mark436-@yahoo.com 
warmly,
Kent 
**END MESSAGE** 
Now, you may be asking yourself now, how easily can this technique be adapted to one person acting alone? Well, the short 
answer is - very easily. All you need to do is be your own "friend". Sign up for another email account, preferably at a different 
email service provider (e.g., hotmail) and then send mail as your "friend" for yourself."

Patterning over the phone
Back to the Table of Contents
Ross Jeffries: "The phone is an incredible way to do patterns because women feel they aren't being observed and therefore can be 
a lot stronger in their responses." 
The consensus of using the phone as a seduction device is divided. Most agree, that if you lack any patterning skills, the phone is 
the kiss of death. Agree on a meeting, agree on her enthusiastic greeting of you once the two of you meet (see "Closing"), if she 
seems to want to have a chit-chat with you, talk to her a little using a low, confident, seductive voice (and smile while you do it, 
she'll hear that:), but generally - just get off the phone as fast as you can! 
On the other hand, the phone has been used to great effect to do patterning. There have even been various reports of being able to 
make women orgasm without letting them toch themselves just by describing various states to them over the phone. The women, 
by the way, were usually even more shocked than the men running patterns on them - neither had previously thought such a thing 
to be even possible:) 
But I would still suggest to use the phone only in case you feel some resistance on her part to meet you in person (which might 
happen if she has never met you in person before, for example a girl you met and seduced online or just a friend of a friend or if 
she for some other reason is disinclined to meet you in person right away). Because there is a world of difference between hearing 
her sigh longingly over the phone or having her sit next to you, holding your hands and wetting her lips:) 
Ross Jeffries:
"You: (after some fluff talk) In fact, I don't know if you can recognise that with each little giggle...with each breath you 
take...with each beat of your heart... you're growing more intrigued, but anyway... just setting aside whatever pictures just keep 
popping into your mind when I say that...how are you doing today?"

Nickname-tease
Back to the Table of Contents
A woman's curiosity is a wonderful tool. You can use it anyway you like, but here is an example of an excellent use if it. What 
you do, is you let her know, that you've just thought of a wonderful nick-name for her. Leave a message on her answering-
machine or send her an e-mail. Her intrigue and curiosity towards you will skyrocket and for example if she hasn't been returning 
your calls or e-mails for a week, you can expect a call or a mail in half an hour, I'm serious:) This is also a wonderful way to kick-
start a new relationship. Then of course, when she contacts you, don't tell her the nickname (and by god, don't tell her you were 
only tricking her:), let her beg for it, let her fry in her own curiosity. And whatever you do, don't give away the nickname over 
the phone or through an e-mail, say it is too personal for that, get her to meet:) Now its your call, when exactly you're going to 
tell her the nickname, but don't do it a minute too soon because (now don't be surprised!:) she might be willing to make out with 
you and even end up in bed with you just to find out her nickname:) During all this, it helps, if you actually really do have a 
nickname for her:) And if it is sweet, endearing and romantic - all the better:) So when you finally do give it to her, you might 
find her infinitely grateful to you:) Here's an example of an initial e-mail on this subject (ASF): 
"For whatever reason, as I was walking outside this evening, I thought of the most wonderful nickname for you. Like have you 
ever been thinking about someone, and it's like you almost feel their spirit gently whisper inside your mind, and you talk to them 
even though they may be miles away. Some people look up at the moon and realise that the one that can share their deepest 
thoughts can see the same moonlight that evening, drifting down through the clouds. 
Anyway, I hope you, like me are having a great day.
[your phone number here] 
If she doesn't call you, she ain't human. NEXT! 
Update. If you really can't think of a nick-name on your own, you can use this advice by Anubis, ASF: 
"Find a personality facet that shines (or which she thinks shines) and put aside an analogous word that describes it. Then search 
for something about her appearance that glows with rarity (or which she spends a lot of time trying to make glow) and put aside 
an analogous word to describe that. 
You now have two romantic/endearing/sexy analogues which, when put together, perform the wondrous neologic magic of a 
nickname! 
Of course, if the magic goes a little sour, you'll have cooked up a nickname which even you can't stomach. In that case, throw it 
in the bin and start again. It actually gets very easy once you've done that a few times."

Common signs of interest
Back to the Table of Contents
Common signs of interest from the girl, applicable mostly in bar-room and club situations. Stephanie Alexander, Maxim 
(http://maximmag.com): 
° She compliments you on virtually anything. Women are used to receiving compliments, not giving them. So if she points out a 
positive characteristic, you’ve impressed her. 
° She’s disagreeing but laughing. Flirtatious sarcasm, as in “Yeah, right, like I believe that!” means she’s into you. If she weren’t, 
she’d simply “Uh-huh” you into oblivion. 
° She keeps asking you to repeat yourself. She’s not allowing the blasting music to come between the two of you. A suggestion of 
a quieter corner to talk in will be well received. 
° She laughs at your lame junior high school–level jokes. She’s obviously lust drunk. Or maybe just drunk. 
° She touches you anywhere. Touch her back in the equivalent place, and let her up the ante, just in case her touch was an 
accidental slip of the hand. 
° She stays put. If you run to drain the monster and she’s still where you left her when you return, you’re doing something right. 
Likewise if she comes back to you after she powders her nose. 
° She doesn’t flinch. If you reach across her to grab a drink or an ashtray and she doesn’t pull back, she’s feeling physically 
comfortable with you. Don’t blow it, pal. 
° She says, “Hey, where ya goin’?” as you leave the bar. She’s angling for an invite. Even if she ultimately says no (she may not 
feel safe going off with you or may not want to ditch her friends) it’s a sign she’s game for a future hookup. 
Update. Maxin, Clifford's Seduction newsletter: "I have built for myself a proximity alert system. When you walk into a 
room/store/bar etc, while a woman might be reluctant or too shy to make eye contact, sometimes, on a conscious or unconscious 
level, she will reveal her interest through proximity. Guys do this all the time. Have you ever walked into a bar and then made 
practically a bee line for the hottest chick, if only to be near her and check her out more? And maybe you "changed your mind" 
and instead of approaching her, you ordered a drink at the bar right next to her? I've been in stores shopping where it seemed that 
a woman I had seen, put herself near me several times over the course of 10-20 minutes. Coincidence? Maybe, but I don't really 
believe that, and it's far more useful for me to believe that a woman finds me interesting or attractive and is putting herself near 
me on purpose hoping that I may start something."

Building a bridge AFC-style
Back to the Table of Contents
ASF: "YOU are interested in her, SHE appears interested in you, what you need is a bridge to open communications: such bridges 
are constructed from a readily available material known commonly as bullshite. Think up some credible or not so credible story & 
get over there and knock on her door. You could tell her you're thinking of buying a dog and ask here advice, you could say 
you've noticed she drinks beer & you know of a good supplier, you could tell her you're doing a survey (you have a PC, so make 
some convincing looking questionnaires), you could tell her you're selling insurance or anything. It doesn't matter: you know its 
bullshit and she knows its bullshit. If she's receptive, as appears, it doesn't matter, she'll play along - that's one of the reasons why 
god put bullshit on earth. If not, she'll tell you to fuck off: so what?" 
Update. The Spare Shoe technique. This is a variation of building an AFC-style bridge with a little less AFC-ness and a little 
more PUA-ness. Don't be fooled however, the fact that the bridge is built out of BS doesn't have to mean it won't hold, especially 
if she is laughing her way across the bridge:) 
Benjamin Strackany, mindlist: "Go up there one evening and bring a shoe or shirt or something. Knock on her door. When she 
answers, say, "Hey, you, I was just passing by and I noticed this shoe here. Is it yours?" Well, of course she'll say no, and then you 
smile and reply, "Oh, hmm, well, I guess it must be mine then. So what're you up to?" Then chat a little more and then run an SS 
pattern on her. Or chat a bit more and then sit down in her doorway and continue talking as if everything is natural. She'll notice 
and laugh and either invite you in or else ask what you're doing. You can then reply, "Oh, I was getting a little tired standing up, 
but we're having such fun talking that I decided to rest a bit so I could put all my energy into making you laugh." She'll smile and 
either sit down to continue talking or else invite you in. 
Even if she's busy, the above should make a cute impression, and you can follow up with an SS pattern to ask her out to coffee."

If more than one girl is giving you the vibe
Back to the Table of Contents
NYC, ASF: "In a case like that where you are receiving vibes from TWO chicks, especially related ones... consider 
EXTRACTING BOTH! The point is that if you take the niece, the aunt will feel rejected and cock-block. If you take the aunt, 
the niece will not CB, but she will not accept any advances from you BECAUSE you have declared interest in her aunt. What 
you want to do here is extract the chicks that LIKE YOU from the chicks that DON'T LIKE YOU and the guys. Separate the 
targets from the obstacles. 
Use whatever you can - "Have you ladies seen the...", "Look, a picture booth... I've never taken a picture with an aunt and niece 
before... let's go" - do whatever you have to do to get them both away from the group. Once you get away, STAY AWAY! Either 
both will stay with you and you can chat them up and display personality, OR only ONE of them will go back to the group. This 
way they effectively decide amongst themselves which one gets you instead of YOU picking one and rejecting the other. If they 
BOTH try to go back to the group, say "Oh cum on. One of you stay with me:)", that should start a debate as to which one will 
stay and which will go."

Reading the signs of a "committed" woman
Back to the Table of Contents
For starters - a story which at first glance only seems to illustrate the mistake of judging a girl by her words and not her actions. 
But after a more careful inspection, even those seemingly "rejecting" words of her are actually a complementary sign to her 
actions (the sign being - "I want you!":). 
Mr Happy, ASF: 
"Ok boys and girls, learn from Mr. Happy's mistake so that you don't fall for it yourself. 
I met this chick online and got her to agree to meet me to play some pool. She was *really* hot. I also did a really good job of 
conveying personality... I got in some good negs, some humor, some teasing, it was very playful, and also some light kino. (I 
know I did this right because she still messages me, etc so maybe I'll get a chance to correct the FUCK UP that I made...read on.) 
See the whole time she is talking about how she is a Christian, and she works for Campus Ministries, and she has a FIANCE, and 
how they're not just DATING, but they are COURTING and how special it is, blah blah. She also says how busy she is because of 
school, and that if I'm going to see her, it'll be on her terms (ha!) so at that point I thought, screw this, I have better things to do 
with my time. She invited me to a mechanical engineer (her major) party that friday and I turned her down. 
She messages me a few days later and talks about how she got drunk and stoned at the party and how she went home with some 
other student and got her brains fucked out. She hopes she isn't pregnant, she doesn't intend to tell her fiance, etc blah. 
That could have been me in there! I will never spare a chick again:)" 
Based on the story above, here are commentaries by Odious on what were/are the signs of a married or borefriended iow 
"committed" woman being interested in you. Odious, ASF: 
"OK, having been with married women before, there are 3 key signs that she's hot to trot and ready to step out. 
1. She will "open up to you" and tell you what IS NOT happening with her man. 
This goes for married women, women with boyfriends... all of them. She will tell you flat out what it is she is missing and what 
she wants. When she starts telling you how he's not cutting it, she's letting you know that door is open. Now this woman did this, 
but it sounds like she was being subtle about it. She said they were courting, not dating... what the hell is that? I think that meant 
"we have a commitment but he's not fucking me." 
2. If she's interested, she'll create opportunities for the two of you to be alone together. 
I had a woman who I didn't even realize was interested in me, come over to my house to study and work on a paper... because her 
computer was on the fritz. The thought that she was hot for me did not even cross my mind until she started asking me my 
opinions on the meaning and value of marriage iow "what would you think of a woman who cheated on her husband... with you... 
right now!" 
3. She knows when he'll be around or not, so she'll want to call the shots as to when you see each other.

How to Lay Girls Guide
She obviously did that one. However, don't count yourself out just yet, because she is still giving you a subset of the first sign 
(which was - telling you what is _not_ happening with her man). She may tell you about other sexual exploits - if she cheated on 
him before, or if she cheated on an old boyfriend etc. So this woman is hitting all the signs. She's opened up to you, she's making 
time, she wants to call the shots as to when you get together, and now she's telling you she cheated. The next time you see her, or 
talk to her - act like you think her cheating is no big deal, that you respect it when women can go for what they want. I have also 
found an attack on the sexist nature of the whole idea of monogamy to be very effective: 
"The whole idea of monogamy dates back to a time when women were treated as property. Men ran the world and made all the 
rules. So men could have mistresses and concubines, but if a woman cheated she was stoned to death. It is completely sexist and 
hypocritical. I think you should listen to your heart and your desires, and see where that leads you. To me, that is the only way to 
go. Fulfill your desires, and seek pleasure. With me, that's what's important. Pleasure is a gift, indulge it and you become a more 
fulfilled and complete person." etc." 
Update. NYC explains why "committed" women are actually quite easy both to approach and even get "very friendly" with:) 
NYC, ASF: 
"Women that are "taken" are different from women that are single in that they are either LESS PICKY or MORE HORNY. Single 
women are either looking for more than just dick (MORE PICKY) or they have less of a sex-drive so they don't REQUIRE a man 
in their lives unless he's just what they want. 
A chick that is "taken" gives herself to her boyfriend so he can fuck her. Now the pressure is on the guy to perform. Unless the 
guy is still HOT for the chick, the sex is routine or most importantly... ORGASMLESS for the woman. When she meets you, she 
feels that DESIRE to be with a man. She feels YOUR DESIRE to please her and take your pleasure from her. It is that 
ROMANTIC kind of interaction that she doesn't get from her "boyfriend" coming home, turning on the TV, watching sports, 
feeling her up for a second (lack of foreplay is a MAJOR turnoff) and fucking her until HE cums and falling asleep. As long as 
she feels like she can get away with it and still have her hum-drum relationship intact, she will fuck you. You would be surprised 
how many women are "taken" but nowhere near SATISFIED! Ray Parker made the point that HBs are NEVER without a man. 
They keep the one they have until they hook up something new. Then they skip off, so if you are waiting for an HB to become 
SINGLE, you can forget it!

Capitalise
Back to the Table of Contents
To capitalise when doing a pick-up would be to * and #close with a girl. To capitalise with a girl that you've already # or *closed 
would be to do a follow-up of calling her and then either by patterning or using any other seduction technique helping her to 
realise what you both have really wanted all along:) And then doing it of course:) 
Apart from your usual pick-ups though, you might have gotten a girl interested in you in the midst of your everyday chores - 
maybe a co-worker, a neighbour, a fellow student, a girl at the cashier. To capitalise would mean NOT TO LET THAT 
WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY CLOSE! She is already preconditioned to liking you, so why let such a perfect opportunity slip? 
I assume of course, that you find her quite amiable as well:) 
As for how to detect such an opportunity - you should know the signs of interest (see Reading body language for more details). 
She initiates contact, calls, emails or starts a conversation with you, smiles, asks questions etc, or reacts to your initiations more 
happily than before or more happily than your average indifferent girl would, giggles with her girlfriends when you pass her by, 
draws hearts in her college-block while sitting beside you (now you're not chasing high-school girls are you?:). See "Reading 
body language" for more signs. 
But she won't stay interested forever. Any day (or night:) a new prospect might catch her attention and even without the threat of 
competition, her interest for you could wear off any moment, no matter what the reason. Even if not really having seduced her 
purposefully, if you detect her interest (and most probably she is doing her best to let you know:) and she is also quite to your 
liking, do end her suffering and extend a helping hand:) 
Make sure that is not a supplicating AFC-ish hand though - that is one of the main reasons of the "I was interested in him/her 
only until he/she developed an interest for me, then it became boring" phenomenon. Stay on top of matters. A girl that has 
developed an interest in you independently in the course of a few months is no different from a girl that you just met and helped 
realise that you are the man of her dreams ten minutes from meeting her - they both need guidance or else they might get lost. 
But you need to begin right away - don't wait for some non-existent "right time" to approach her or ask her out (hopefully you're 
past any such thinking though:) or for her to make the first move (she WON'T, and if you don't make the first move she will 
eventually dismiss you as an ignorant chump or think you're not interested and in either case - she'll move on). Believe me, if you 
already noticed the signs of interest, SHE IS interested! And don't even try to dismiss them as random friendliness or your 
imagination, if you noticed them, they're for real:) Now once you know she is interested - capitalise on it!

they will give you numbers and you can leave the group... EVEN IF IT IS THE BEST THING GOING! You can come back later 
if you want, but you already have their numbers in case they leave or you need to rush out or catch a chick that wants to fuck right 
now! Even if you have to exit the bar and take a stroll and then come back having done nothing for ten minutes, IMO, closing at a

Asking for a… date?
Back to the Table of Contents
No, you're not going to ask for a date. Movies, dinners (or… museums, anyone?:) are for girls that have convinced you that they 
want you in a most believeable fashion - by having done the fun with you (and I don't mean playing "Monopoly":). 
But let's say you have #- or *closed a girl. You need to get in contact with her again, right? You could of course do patterns over 
the phone and have her rush horny to your doorstep. But it is infinitely better to meet her in person. So what you do, is suggest a 
get-together, preferably somewhere where you two can talk, see each other and touch each other undisturbed. 
Just as your pick-up attempt must look like anything but a pick-up attempt, so must your asking for a "date" be anything but that. 
For that purpose it is recommended not to ask her for a get-together on a Friday or a Saturday night. Not that you shouldn't do it, 
but the time itself suggests a more date-like occasion, an image which is better avoided. If you nevertheless decide in favour of a 
Friday of Saturday night, keep in mind that the odds of her being busy are higher than on other nights, so she may have to turn 
you down, which could create some bad vibes. And it might tell her that you don't have anything (or anyone:) to do on the 
weekend (so don't forget to serve it as "the only few moments of free time" in your schedule:). 
On the other hand, the benefits of arranging a meeting during the week are as follows (Don Diebel:) 
G     You imply that you are busy on the weekend. In other words, you are involved with other girls. 
G     The odds of her being available are greater. 
G     Weeknights imply a casual, no-pressure atmosphere which is good to get to know her (or rather, to get her to get to know 
you:). 
G     You have turned a dull weeknight into a good time for her - good vibes right off the bat. 
Now that we've cleared that the "date" in "asking for a date" is not a date but a get-together, its time to reveal that neither is the 
"asking" asking but suggesting. You don't ask her for anything. You're giving her opportunities (like you didn't ask for her phone-
number, you constructed her an opportunity of giving it to you). And you are just making suggestions ("We should meet / get-
together. How about then and there?"). Don't make the mistake of putting her on the pedestal and grovelling before her begging 
and asking "please-please-please will you go out with me?", "oh please let's go on a date?", "oh please please do cum with me!":) 
If you ASK her to go out with you and she says "no", she won't even give it another thought (and don't be fooled by any excuses 
she might be giving you). But if you SUGGEST a casual meeting and offer her a time and place, she'll first have to think, what 
she's doing at that time, and if it turns out she's busy (she might very well be), she is much more likely to offer another time and / 
or another place. Either way, you're much more likely to get yourself your get-together:). 
If however you sense some reluctance on her part nevertheless ("maybe some other time", "no, my schedule if full till next year" 
etc), you need to take out the big guns (no, not those, pull up your pants!:). It seems like time for patterning, negging, value-
eliciting or whatever seems more appropriate with her over the phone. Ask her is she has a little time to talk to you now. Even if 
it has been her earnest attempt to LJBF you and blow you off, she might feel just a little guilty about it and agree to talk to you 
for a few minutes. And now you've got her:) 
But all through this process remember, you don't NEED her. If she's smart enough, she knows a good thing when she sees (or

hears:) one. But if she just consistently seems to be wasting your time, heck, you've got some 50 more phone-numbers waiting in 
line to be called:) 
Update 
In a situation when you have acquired the phone number of a girl that you are or have become interested in in business 
circumstances (as opposed to having acquired her number to call her in a matter of a more personal nature), you can still turn this 
around for you by using the following advice from Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.com.au). Whether you have become in 
possession of her number as either one of you being a representative, salesman or clerk of some sort and after you're sure that 
you and her will most probably not be conducting any business in the future (becacause you know what they say about mixing 
work and personal life), you can call her with the following (by Johnny Shack): 
""You really caught my attention and thats why I'm talking with you now". Wait for her to reply and then say, "I'm the type of 
guy who can't hold back his emotions and if I didn't ring and talk with you I just wouldn't have been able to sleep tonite". You 
need to deliver this in a fun sort of way so its not too corny but it is what they all love to hear. If you can have them listening to 
this and have them wondering if you mean it, then you are on a winner and you have delivered it to perfection. Then say "So how 
about we go out on the weekend and see if we like each other? I'm a pretty good judge of character and I think we'll get along. So 
how about Friday or Saturday night [think twice though before asking her on such a formal-sounding weekend date, see the 
beginning of this article for more information]"" 
Naturally, this approach can also be tailored to non business-related situations, just substitute the business to personal type 
communication transition with something more appropriate. And here's some more advice on asking the girl out via the phone. 
Johnny Shack: 
"If you deliver these [asking her out] lines a few times, you will adapt to them easily. You won't need a written prompter in front 
of you once your confidence is flowing and you'll master some typical comebacks to their answers. However, it may be a good 
idea to have a prompter to if you're still a beginner - this will keep you on track if you get stuck for words. Also, its not a bad 
idea if you are not a natural conversationalist to have a few topics written down on paper in front of you to keep things going. If 
you ring a girl, you need to keep the topics flowing - this communicates to her that the two of you are getting along well. After a 
while you will mold your own personality into what you are saying and it will start to come across very naturally. It is important 
to stick to the basic message [of asking her out] though. 
During the conversation compliment her and let her know how she really grabbed your attention [once again, think twice about 
this, see Neghits explained and Paying her a compliment for more information]. Everyone loves to talk with people who make 
them feel good. It can also make her feel so special that nothing could stop you from calling her. 
If she says to you that you ask girls out all of the time don't get thrown. You say this: "Well, yes I do go out with a lot of girls 
because I'm picky". Wait for her to talk. She will most likely say: "How can you be picky if you go out with a lot of girls? It 
doesn't make sense." This is where you will win her over by saying: "When I find the girl who can keep me interested then I will 
stay with her. I need to go out with different girls to give myself a chance of finding her. Otherwise I would have to just stay at 
home and I'll never meet my dream girl will I?" By ending this with "will I?" you put her in a position where it is her turn to 
answer and any reasonable thinking girl will agree with what you are saying. 
With this you have successfully demonstrated a philosophy to her, which gels with your own intentions of taking her out on a 
date. She has understood what you are talking about and it applies to her as well. She will start to think that you do have to go out 
with a lot of people to find the one you really want and if she is single she may as well go out with you." 
I have to interfere here. "If she is single" - it may be argued that this is exactly why asking someone directly on a date might 
sometimes not be a good idea as a simple phone-call from you most probably won't be enough for her to go out with you, 
especially if she is not single. Then again, it is always ultimately better to try a lower probability approach than not to try 
anything at all. Besides, you should be too busy to care for a possible rejection. And being busy is also exactly why you´d use 
this fast and lower probability approach as you simply lack the time or motivation to invest in a higher probability approach. 
After all, you don't even quite know her yet, so why would you want to invest anything more to get her to agree to go out with 
you. In fact, this is also exactly why you're calling her - you're only trying to give the both of you a chance to get to know each 
other better. In conclusion - if you already know you really want her, you'd better take into consideration the lower probability

rate of this approach, if however you're not quite sure yet, this approach is a perfect way to find out. Now on with Johnny Shack's 
advice: 
"Always remember that she wants to find a boyfriend or lover just as you want to find the woman you desire. You have also got 
her to agree with your philosophies and she will now start to look at you as a smart person. Women want a man to be able to 
teach her things and to be the decision maker. In the majority of marriages you will find the man is at least 51% in control. Most 
women want their man to be smart and the one in control so if you win a conversation like this one early on then you will be in a 
good position to land her if you want to. 
Also, you let her know how your emotions took control of you and that is why you couldn't stand it if you didn't ring her. 
Women don't want wimps but they do want a guy who is sensitive and can talk about his emotions. 
If you say you couldn't sleep if you didn't call her you are adding charm and showing what a fun personality you have. 
Personality and charm will win a girl over good looks more times than you thought possible. 
You actually ask the question about you both going on a date together. You ask her out and you also give an approximate time 
for when you should go out together. You don't want to give her a yes or no answer question rather you want to give her a 
question about if the weekend is suitable. This can get you a lot of dates when the girl may not have even planned on saying yes 
to you. She is not thinking about whether or not she will go out with you now but whether or not the weekend will be all right. 
Your assertiveness can throw your targets thinking off balance for just enough time to make a date with her. Once you get her to 
say yes it is very hard for her to turn around and cancel the date [see If she cancels the date for more information on what to do, 
if that happens]." 
And once the date is set and the initiating routine agreed upon (see Set the mood of the date from the start in Kinaesthetics and 
Refining the close in Closing for more information on that) it is time to hang up. Lingering on the phone after closing the date is 
the kiss of death. If anything ever needs to be quit, the best time to do it is always the highpoint, and the highpoint of your 
conversation with her is fixing the date. So be polite, make your departure and leave her frying in the excitement of the 
upcoming date:)

Ross Jeffries: 
Scenario 1 
Her: I can't make it. I've got a rare tropical disease that's causing me to shrink by the hour. 
You: (dead silence for as long as it takes for her to talk again. Just say NOTHING!!!) 
Her: Hello? Are you there? What's wrong? 
You: What's wrong is I can't believe the bullshit I'm hearing. 
Her: What????? 
You: Look...you made a commitment to spend time with me and now you're blowing me off. You're disrespecting me and 
disrespecting my time and I'm NOT going to put up with it. My rule is, if someone makes a commitment to me, I expect them to 
keep it. If they can't keep it, I need to know at least a day in advance so I can make other plans. Got it? If you can live with that 
rule, great...if not, sayanora! 
Then, HANG UP!! 
Now, this may sound extreme, but man does it work well!!! In fact, she'll probably call back with five minutes and apologise and 
ask you out!!! I'm not kidding here; I've seen the hardest, jaded bitches go to giggly little girls, eager to please me when I've done 
this. It throws some kind of switch in their heads. I guess with some people, you don't really get their attention until... You Give 
Them A Swift Kick In The Ass!! 
Scenario 2 
You go to pick her up at her place and she either keeps you waiting outside for more than ten minutes, or lets you in and then 
proceeds to talk on the phone for at least that long while totally ignoring you. Wait for her to finish, and as soon as she does say 
something like this: 
YOU: Can I ask you a question? 
HER: Sure. 
YOU: Are you being intentionally rude to test me, or are you just an accidental asshole? 
HER: (mouth dropping open in shock, unable to say anything!) 
YOU: Don't ever keep me waiting like this again, ok? I'll always treat you respectfully, but I expect the same. Do you understand 
me?

Our World routine
Back to the Table of Contents
The Our World routine, contributed by Maniac High, constructs an imaginary world for both you and the girl, where the two of 
you can feel happy, comfortable and relaxed, and free to do anything you wish irrespective of the rules and norms of society or 
the attitutudes of other people, because quite simply - you are now in a different world, a world without any outside influences, a 
world where normal rules don't apply, a world for just the two of you. You are in "our world":) 
The desired outcome of building "our world" in a conversation with the girl is to agree on ending up at your place the next time 
you two meet. This also works very well when arranging a "date" over the phone. But don't start building the world until you 
know exactly, what it needs to be like. So first you have to find out about her values and principles and her possible objections to 
meeting you / ending up at your place. After you've done enough value-eliciting and come to know her possible objections (she 
might have a boyfriend, she might be afraid of social labelling etc), you can start building the perfect world for the two of you, 
which represents all of which she values, circumvenes everything she objects to but most importantly (and this is what you are 
striving for:) - is free of any usual social restrictions and objections to sharing, loving, touching, feeling wonderful in each other's 
company, you know where this list is headed to:) 
The following example assumes the girl has a boyfriend as an additional obstacle (modified from Maniac High's post to ASF 
describing yet another Japanese PUA in action). 
The first thing to do is fluff talk and finding her interests, then shifting from interests to romantic talk ASAP. For example, if a 
chick says she likes snowboarding, you'll ask if she ever had a BF who liked snowboarding. If she did - start talking about that 
BF, and what he was like. If not, you can ask if she had a BF with any similar hobbies and then what he was like etc. Soon you 
can move into what she likes in a guy, and relationships, and the onto the general nature of human beings. Make sure the girl is 
fairly intelligent for such themes though, beacause if she isn't, she might feel like you're flying over her head and leaving her in 
the dust, in other words - miserable and bored. So if she responds - continue; if not, switch themes. 
Assuming she is able to keep up with the conversation about the nature of all human beings, you can continue talking about what 
a human being is like in his/her essence and what are his/her natural desires - a need, a craving for affection and nurturing; giving, 
receiving and sharing love; feeling close and becoming one with another human being; feeling protected and safe, yet free to do 
whatever her heart wishes to do etc. Then compare that with how society restricts her in certain ways, like being able to have only 
one BF or one husband. Then talk about how it is interesting that in other societies, like Arab or amongst certain Mormons it is 
different - the woman is free to have several men and not feel ashamed or embarressed, because it is just an expression of natural 
human feelings anyway (this one is tricky though - she must be intelligent enogh to keep up with the conversation but not 
intelligent enough to know that those claims are actually FALSE! So watch your step:). In western cultures however this is 
(unfairly) looked down at. 
This is where you introduce the concept of "our world". Suggest and idea of "our own special world", where the rules of society 
don't have to apply (with the underlaying message of "cheating on your BF is fine":), and where you can hold each other and hug, 
be comfortable in each others arms, relaxed, happy and feel secure. Your goal here is to make her feel secure and free to betray 
her BF, because all of this takes place in a "separate world" of just the two of you (apart from this example of using "our world" to 
overcome her objections to cheating on her boyfriend, remember that you can use "our world" to overcome any possible 
objections she might have). 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/ourworld.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:35:31 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
After this is done and all set up, you then make the pitch for her to come over in order to enjoy that separate world where you can 
be together and hold each other in "our world". You describe how you can celebrate, hug, and don't forget to say directly that she 
doesn't have to have sex if she doesn't want to (continue building a world of security and freedom). Say something like "Have you 
ever felt/noticed when holding each other, how it feels good, how it feels to connect with each other and feel fabulous. I think that 
sex, well its like a recognition of this connection". Usually around this point, she accepts to come over and you agree on a 
time/date. 
But you're not home free yet. Either when talking to her over coffee or over the phone, don't end the conversation here. Her 
agreeing to come to your place might mean she will be comfortable and then again, it might not. And even if she feels 
comfortable about it at the moment, she might just freak out at the last moment the next time you meet and bail. Women have a 
much more easier time accepting almost anything, if they have been told about it in advance and they know to expect it. So 
instead of leaving now, introduce and describe to her the next time the two of you are going to meet. Describe the initial encounter 
in beautiful, wonderful, uplifting and positive terms. Plus don't forget to add some important details:) 
Here's an example of what to say: "It will be a wonderful day, which you can already imagine now... as I meet you at the 
(station/place), I will hug you, and that connection will be visible, I will take your hand, and we will begin the journey to "our 
world" (my place:)... and then when we arrive at the gate/door, I will kiss you, and we will enter together and how nice it will be 
to connect, hold each other, being free from restrictions of the outside world, when we are in "our world" together, and feeling 
fabulous together. And how wonderful that will all feel. You can imagine that, can't you?". 
Now that you're scripted the encounter, the two of you can depart. And when the day comes, act it out exactly as you described it 
(you can't do anything about the weather though - if its raining when you were describing a sun-shiny day, well, a bummer, lets 
hope she won't mind:). 
So you meet the girl, hug her and say: "Welcome, I am glad you have come to share "our world" today". You then take her and go 
to your place. At the door you say: "Welcome to "our world", and add that you want to kiss you before you enter, like you said on 
the phone. Usually the girl agrees and you can kiss her gently outside (setting the stage for when she gets inside). 
You go in, sit down. Talk about a relaxing secure hug, then start to hug on the couch or wherever it is you sat down. Then kiss her 
again - which is okay, since you already started outside. Then some more kissing... and more touching... neck... ears... breast 
(okay, you're on your own from here on:). 
Maniac High: "He says it works every time. It runs like clockwork, and he could lay a girl after about 20 minutes after they got 
in."

If she has second thoughts
Back to the Table of Contents
Partial Estonian translation 
To "help" her decide, when she already wants it, you can try these pattern-like approaches: 
Ross Jeffries: 
"We shouldn't do it, and we shouldn't enjoy so much. And please don't try to convince me, that you'd really want to do it… 
now… with me, this is the way I see it…" 
"I just talked to my friend, Tina, and she told me it is so unbelievably unfair, that men can make love to any woman they choose, 
but if a woman wants to express exercise and enjoy her sexual liberty, she is frowned upon. And I completely agree with her, 
frowning is just an expression of utter hypocrisy. For example, have you ever met a guy and instantaneously felt an irresistible 
attraction and fascination, that soon thoughts and feelings start flashing in your mind that you'd like to act upon and make a 
reality right away? It is just so unfortunate, how the society frowns when you just relax and let go and truly enjoys your 
feelings… now… with me… the way I see this is that (bla-bla:)…" 
"Have you ever met someone (sp) and instantaneously feel such a complete attraction for him (sp), that you feel like you just 
_have_ to do something about it? It's the kind of feeling, that you just have to get near that guy and you know, that even if you 
never see him again, you'll be happy with all your choices and you'll always cherish the pleasant memories?" 
Update. Aside from patterning your way around her second-thoughts, you could also tackle her possible objections (to going out 
with you, to sleeping with you etc) head-on. But this will only work in case these objections are for real - meaning they are not 
some BS-excuses meant to just jerk you around until she decides to LJBF you. Differentiating between BS- and real excuses is 
not easy to do as many excuses that sound like complete BS to men are very real for women indeed. 
The following example taken from "Sweep women off their feet..." illustrates a BS-sounding but real objection and how it was 
overcome: 
"There was this girl who used to be a model. She was absolutely gorgeous and had a great body. She was always concerned that 
her butt was too big. I had the hardest time seducing her and trying to make love because of it. She was hot and bothered, she 
wanted to have sex as much as I did but this silly little thing was stopping her. She didn't want me to see her naked because she 
was ashamed of her "big butt" and she was afraid I wouldn't find her attractive anymore. Anything I would say to let her know 
that her butt is just fine was met with resistance. "The only reason you're saying that is because you don't want to hurt my 
feelings," she kept saying. So what happened? We compromised. We had sex in complete darkness so I can't see her big butt. It 
took us sleeping together a few times before she was comfortable enough for me to see her naked, and of course, she went on a 
diet before that." 
Ideally she should of course be so attracted to you after all the patterning and value-eliciting etc, that she just doesn't care any 
more and simply has to have you. However you can not always count on that, in which case it is easier to find out what her 
possible objections might be and then do your best to make the issues go away.

If you can't seem to figure out, what exactly her objections are, you can make it more comfortable for her to tell you by using this 
slightly humorous approach: "Imagine I have a magic wand and I can use this magic wand to make anything I wish just 
disappear. So just tell me one thing you'd like for me to make disappear in order for you to feel comfortable about us going out 
together (or going to my place/your place:). It can be absolutely anything - maybe a person, or some attitude of our society, or a 
project you need to finish in time, maybe something about yourself, or something about me - absolutely anything. But what 
would that one thing (you'd like to disappear in order for you to feel comfortable about us being together) be?" 
There's a good chance that after having formulated her objection, it starts to look smaller and even insignificant to herself 
already. But you didn't ask the above question just to rely on that. Depending on the objection you should now be trying to 
eliminate or lessen the obstacle any way you can (patterning your (her:) way around it, reaching some sort of a compromise etc). 
Update. The following strategy is designed to eliminate any possible second-thoughts she might have before she ever has them. 
For that purpose you will have to give her what Jobet Claudio from Mindlist calls The Mental Escape Hatch: 
"When closing the deal with a woman, always, and always, and always provide her Mental Escape Hatch. More often than not a 
woman will have an internal conflict about fucking with someone who's not her boyfriend or husband. This may stem mostly 
from societal programming and no woman will want to have herself labelled as a "tramp", either by herself or by society. 
Thus it is incumbent upon you to create a Mental Escape Hatch for a woman. In simpler words, give her an EXCUSE to have sex 
with you. In effect, she must be able to retain her self-worth even after she's had the tremendous experience of doing it with you. 
And you do that by creating a mental escape hatch, an excuse, or a scapegoat upon which she can point blame as to why "it 
happenned". That excuse can range from the lame to the profound, but it doesn't matter too much. Just do it and give her an 
excuse - give her an excuse to fuck you. 
For example, if you wanna take her to your place, you aint gonna tell her: "Hey, lets go to my place and fuck". In her mind, an 
alarm goes off saying "Yea! I wanna... um... Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!" 
The right way to do it is to present something that could be interesting to her. "Hey... wanna see my Picasso collection (owws?)... 
I've got a wonderful collection of rare love music in my pad... wanna listen to them and maybe we'll go for a nightcap... then I'll 
walk you home (subtitle: in the morning)?" 
Then of course there's alcohol. A great excuse for many. You drink a couple of glasses of wine. You fire off your NLS routine. 
She falls for it and you make love on the couch. In the morning, she can always tell herself "Ohh...must have been the wine". 
Great huh? A mental escape hatch. An internal excuse. 
What's the mechanics of this? What does it do? It allows her by shifting responsibility to someone or something else other than 
herself, to retain her self-steem. And if you know what you're doing, don't and I mean DON'T try to break down her excuse. 
More often than not, the mere fact that she did it with you one time is already an excuse for her to do it again. By then, the 
psychological barriers have been broken down. 
Mental Escape Hatches can be used in the pre- and post-fuck stages. As a pre-fuck routine, it disarms resistance by presenting 
different motives other than sex. As a post-fuck routine, it ensures that the woman won't feel bad about "doing it" and you wont 
get something akin to buyers remorse. 
For example, with one of my partners, I asked her "Hey... I've got Sleepless in Seattle at home. Wanna watch a home movie with 
me? There'll be popcorn and some wine". She went. We did it. Mentally, she would say to herself "We never intended to do it... 
we just went there to watch a movie, but I got so swept away by my emotions from the film... so when he kissed me it just felt so 
right"

Networking and pivots
Back to the Table of Contents
Here's a rule never to forget: ugly girls have ugly girlfriends, mediocre looking girls have mediocre looking girlfriends and… yep, 
you guessed it:) - beautiful girls have beautiful girlfriends:) Networking in the context of this guide is getting to know every 
beautiful girl's girlfriends - either she introduces you to them, they want themselves to be introduced to you by her or you hang out 
together and you get to know them naturally and… then you move on to those girls and their girlfriends:) This is why it is 
important not to lose one single girl - you will not only lose the girl but also a chance to meet all her female friends and their 
female friends etc. 
What do I mean by losing? The most glaring example is her "LJBF"-ing you - then you're pretty much dead (and no, you won't be 
"friends" with her and get to meet all her friends this way:). Naturally, if you play it right, it will never happen to you - she either 
falls for you completely, or when you see that you're not getting anywhere you cut your losses before she notices anything (and 
has a chance to LJBF you), or she simply is not up to your standards and you LJBF her instead. Besides being LJBF-ed you could 
lose a girl in a number of similar ways - negging a sub-9 who'll hate you for it (see neg hits), confronting her with a proposal she 
outright refuses ("can I buy you a drink?", "wanna dance?", "your place or mine?":) - all of which communicate you a message of 
"I don' want you" ("at least not now" or "at least not this way" or "at least not here" to be more precise:). (With enough 
knowledge, experience, sensitivity and persistence you could of course regain control of the situation and even win her back. 
Would you however have had those qualities in sufficient quantities, you should never have encountered a situation of losing her 
in the first place:) So whenever you are on the verge of losing a girl, remember that her value is not only in what she herself has to 
offer but also in all her girlfriends you could get to know. Thinking about it like that, it should become much easier for you to 
LJBF her first (which in fact has much more of a chance of getting to be her friend than her having LJBF-ed you:) or to keep her 
as a pivot instead of cutting her loose. 
In addition to being able to make friends with all their girlfriends, keeping girls as pivots has the added benefit of letting you be 
seen with girls. This makes other girls envious and intrigued about you, and presents you as a challenge as opposed to you being 
alone, thus "easy" and a bore plus a "looks-like-nobody-wants-him-anyway". So get to know beautiful girls and their girlfriends, 
hang out with them, network, make them your pivots whenever appropriate. One word of caution though - don't forget that "being 
friends" with beautiful girls and making them your pivots is not your GOAL, it is only a side-strategy:) You do remember what 
your goal is, don't you:)? 
NYC (ASF): "BASICALLY... it's use it or lose it. She has first right of refusal. We are either going out as a guy and a girl that are 
going to be all over each other and fuck at the end of the night, OR we are going out as ME trying to get more bitches and you 
doing whatever the fuck YOU want to do, OR we are not going out at all! Imagine taking your own PERSONAL COCK 
BLOCKER with you somewhere? FUCK THAT! If she's not interested in having sex with me, it's INSTANT LJBF and I will 
describe to her her role in getting me other chicks. I also tell her DIRECTLY that I want to meet all her girlfriends. If she isn't 
down with that, she's THROUGH!" Pretty graphic but to the point, NYC:) See also "The pivot theory" for an elaboration on this. 
Update 
The magic of pivots further explained by Johnny Shack (http://showgirls.au.com): 
"If you are going to the same place all of the time then it is a good idea to meet up with girls and hang in a group. Have you ever 
noticed how girls pay you obvious attention when you are with a girl? If girls see you with other girls it makes the world of 
difference. They all of a sudden want to know you. They become a lot easier to start up a conversation with once they have seen 
you around girls. It's as though you become a prize to them to see if they can manipulate you into their web. They want to see if

they can lure your thoughts into their's thus winning out over the girl you are with. Girls are very bitchy and competition between 
them is played with a completely different set of rules than men. They also feel safe giving you "FUCK ME EYES" because they 
know they can tease you and you probably won't approach them. I think sometimes they are living out a fantasy being as forward 
as they choose to be with guys who are supposedly taken. They know they are being tarty but the beauty of it is that they know no-
one will ever find out. If girls know in their minds you will not tell anyone about having sex with them that night then you are half 
way there if you have the girl interested in you [see also The Trust pattern for an additional technique of alleviating her fear of 
people finding out the two of you had sex]."

The pivot theory
Back to the Table of Contents
[Pivot = a chick that you take to a bar to in order to pick up other chicks. Use chicks who won't lay you but still want to see you, 
for this purpose. Basically, this works most chicks will find you more attractive and jealous when you are already with a chick 
than when are not. -- Maniac High] 
>Hey, NYC, I was just wondering - how often when you spin this line do
>you suddenly get the chick changing her mind and deciding to get happy
>with you? 
ALL THE TIME :) 
it's not to the point of sex thought... it's kinda interesting. what I am really doing is telling them the truth, that if they don't want to 
have sex with me then they are going to be treated like one of the fellas. They will DEFINITELY be paying for their own shit (if 
they had ANY inkling that I was going to pay for them when we go out) and I will be looking at and trying to meet and make out 
with any chicks that I like while I am with her. She will suddenly be my co-worker or cousin or whatever she has to be to get the 
other girls comfortable with talking to me. what happens to them though is they LOSE their GRIP on me (that they never had in 
the first place) they THINK that they are going to get special treatment and attention from me because I WANT TO FUCK 
THEM. as soon as I remove that from them, they realize who they really are... NOBODY! they immediately struggle somehow to 
get their status back. either they keep complaining about it not being RIGHT for me to talk to other women in front of them in 
which case I bring up all this sexual shit that they JUST FIISHED SAYING they don't want with me OR they say something 
about I meant not TODAY or some variation. they try to make it seem like if I can treat them like women for a few dates that they 
will give it up. NOPE! not interested. if she can't be into me NATURALLY and RIGHT NOW then she is LJBF and that's it (until 
she comes up with some DRASTIC sexual move that puts her back in the running) 
if they survive that point and actually go out with me as a pivot... THE SPARKS FLY! as soon as they see the smiles I get from 
RANDOM women passing by and they see the looks on my face toward those women, they SUDDENLY don't want to play the 
game anymore. I suppose it's that competitive-woman thing where they want the guy that the other chick has... but she is already 
WITH ME AND GETTING JEALOUS! at some point she reconsiders OR acccepts her role as a pivot. 
trust me. a girl that is not sexing you is MORE VALUABLE as a pivot than anything else. you can take her out and get EASIER 
RESPONSES from other women ALL NIGHT! plus the other women ASSUME that you are paying for her shit and treating her 
the way THEY want to be treated. then they see you smiling at them and figure they may be able to snag you from her. 
if she accepts her role, you can send her to the bar for drinks STRATEGICALLY near women that you want to meet. let HER 
strike up a conversation and invite them over to the table... money in ghe bank fellas. 
like I said, they don't HOP IN THE BED WITH ME as soon as I tell them what the deal is, but you can tell that their need for 
attention and affection and to be desired kicks in when you REMOVE all those things from your relationship. when she realizes 
that she will get some conversation from you and invited to go out to WATCH YOU meet other chicks that she KNOWS are 
going to sex you because she would herself if she wasn't bullshitting, she kicks it into gear to get back the relationship she 
WANTED YOU for in the first place. even if she only wanted to tease you every day and go to sleep ALONE knowing someone 
wanted her that day, she can't do that as a "friend". she has to find a way to get herself OUT OF LJBF to prove herself an 
attractive, seductive woman. that's her new CHALLENGE!

How to Lay Girls Guide
>How often do they tell you to fuck off (presumably lower than an
>average guy, given your obvious personal presence and looks)? 
it depends on her personality, and opportunities for hanging out. you can kinda tell which way they are going to go. all I want is 
for them to be out of my way. if their response to "hand over the sex" is "no way" and their response to "in that case, I will treat 
you like one of the fellas" is "I want to be treated like a DATE" I will explain to them that I only date women I am sexing... not in 
so many words... then it is their decision. if they can't handle their new position, or they are too PROUD to stand by while I meet 
other women... oh, I forgot to mention that I let then know VERY CLEARLY that I spend the most time with my favorite girls, so 
they are essentially witnessing THE END of their time with me as they watch me meet girls that are OBVIOUSLY dying to get 
me home. there is no way that a "friend" that I hang out with is going to get my time over a girl I am fucking AND can hang out 
with AND STILL meet other chicks! 
if they do tell me to fuck off, I start the debate of "ok, fine... but I offered you my time sexually, then I offered you my time non-
sexually... you just turned down both... WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU WANT TO MEET ME FOR?" that normally kicks off 
some introspection... and sometimes a sly smile that gives their bullshit game away... then it's KINO TIME! 
>How far into the conversation do you go before you make this clear to
>them? 
it all depends. the first thing I want to do is elicit their values. I need to know what I am passing up before I do it. as soon as she 
doesn't meet the criteria of the level of woman that I want to have sex with (past a one night stand) she's LJBF. I will entertain any 
objections to us being just friends and after that, I will offer to her to hang out with me even though we aren't going to be 
screwing... but here are the rules of hanging out with me...

Attract girls by being busy
Back to the Table of Contents
Let the girls know that you are a busy and important person. 
Don Diebel: 
H     When a girl asks you what you did yesterday, never say, "Oh, I just sat around and was bored." Better to say, "I was up 
early to run errands and take care of business, then played tennis, met a friend for lunch, and worked in the afternoon." Lie 
if you have to. And don't worry, you'll get used to it:) 
H     If a girl calls and asks what you are doing, reply with, "I just walked in the door" or "I'm just on my way out to take care of 
business." 
H     Don't hang on the the phone for hours talking to girls indicating you don't have anything else to do. Get the business of the 
call over, be pleasant, then excuse yourself. 
H     By not calling a girl every night or contacting her every day, you show that you are busy and have other things that are 
important in your life besides her. This lets her know that she is going to have to compete for your time. 
H     If you run into someone, be pleasant and friendly. Show that person that you have an interest in her, but then excuse 
yourself because of having things to do. In this way, you show her that she is going to have to work for your time. You are 
not "easy." 
By letting people know that you are a person doing things and active, you suggest a lot to a girl. Certainly, you must be someone 
who knows where you are going, hence, leadership. You play on her sense of wanting what she can't have because she will have 
to compete for your time with all of your other activities. You will appear to be different from all the other guys who are hanging 
on her begging for her time. She will suspect that there are other girls in your life or you wouldn't be so busy. And finally, she is 
going to have to use her charms to seduce you away from all these other activities - and girls just love a challenge:) 
Update. Craig, Clifford's Seduction newsletter: "Make her miss you. But in order for scarcity to be effective you have to be sure 
of one thing. The time she does spend with you must be absolutely amazing, and without a doubt the best time she could have 
with anyone. You need to be able to create an awesome, MEMORABLE experience with anyone, anywhere, especially when it 
really counts. 
Also, she can NEVER be the first priority in your life. Always put her second to something, whether it be your family, career, 
friends, whatever, but leave a small piece of hope in her mind that she could become #1."

Put a price on yourself
Back to the Table of Contents
Ross Jeffries: "And one of the most true and powerful realities of human nature is: IF SOMETHING COMES AT VERY 
LITTLE COST, PEOPLE TEND TO THINK IT IS OF LITTLE VALUE! We believe that things that are difficult to possess are 
inherently of better quality and that things that are easy to posses are of little value or quality. In other words, absent knowing 
what something can do for them, people will make a judgement based on what they have to give up to get it. They confuse price 
with value. I certainly hope that you are smart enough to see the difference. Personally, I judge the worth of something based on 
what it will do for me. But practically speaking, here are some ways to do it in your behaviour in the field: 
1.  At the appropriate place and time, SHOW YOUR ANGER!! Guys who never get mad, who never show that they will 
stand up for themselves and make a woman feel a bit of unpleasantness are, in effect, giving themselves away for free!! 
Let the females in your life know that if they break your rules, cross you, or show any lack of respect that THEY ARE 
GOING TO PAY A PRICE! 
2.  Be willing to withdraw your time and attention and be unavailable! There are actually two rules working here: one is that 
people value more what they have to work for, but also the rule is: if it's rare or becoming MORE scarce it's viewed as 
being more valuable. 
Well, in any case, as I've said, it's a reality, so use it in the following ways: 
A.  A. Now and again, cancel dates. 
B.  B. Don't always return her phone calls promptly 
C.  C. On occasion, and especially in the beginning, GET OFF THE PHONE FIRST!! Don't have unlimited time or 
willingness to talk!! 
That should get her viewing you as scarce and therefore a lot more valuable and therefore something... She's Willing To Pay A 
Hell Of A Lot More To Get!! Now the final, and perhaps the most important rule I can give you is: Let Women (and people in 
general) Know What Your Rules Are And What You Expect Of Them!!! Now, I didn't say whine or demand. I just said let them 
know with the attitude of: Hey, these are the rules. If you care to obey them, great. You'll receive GREAT value in return. If not, 
please get out of the way because plenty of people are lined up who WILL pay, and gladly so. 
Finally on this topic, you should take steps to totally eliminate from your life anyone in any capacity who will not pay your price, 
after you have clearly informed them what that price may be, and most especially if they have explicitly agreed to pay it. As I 
have long said, confidence works two ways: both in going for what you do want and moving away from what you don't. If you 
don't eliminate those who won't pay the price, then you will be undercutting your confidence when you want to move towards 
what you want, because your behaviour is not 100% congruent with your belief that you are a person of value who is deserving 
of the best." 
Update. Craig, Clifford's Seduction newsletter: "Make her put some work into hanging out with you in order for her to value

you. Make her come and pick you up, make her spend some money on you, make her call and do you favors, etc. When she does 
things for you it will justify her own feelings for you and allow them to grow."

Suggest competition
Back to the Table of Contents
When you first get to know a girl, it would be better if she suspects that you are seeing other women as well as her. It makes you 
more attractive to her and she knows she will have to work hard to get you. Have names and numbers of other girls popping out of 
your wallet (when paying for yourself of course, not her:) or have them laying around in your house/apartment/car, don't be 
desperate for her (best way to accomplish this is to have some 5 other girlfriends at the same time:), don't be available at all times, 
be slightly unpredictable in your actions (this is also good for keeping her on her toes in general:)

passion for if on some level she believes she could do something to lose you! Understand that when you show this willingness to 
walk away, in any area of your life, it conveys the message that you are the prize to be pursued, that you are the person of value, 
and they had better take advantage of the opportunity. This is an attitude that will move you forward in any area that's challenging 
you. By way of contrast, if you show a non-stop, forever and ever devotion to her, and put up with her crap and ambivalence, then 
where is that tension of knowing she could lose you? Answer: nowhere! And that's why you get nowhere when you put up with 
this kind of stuff! If you've seen an initially hot relationship grow ice-cold, this is one big reason!!!"

Use her friends
Back to the Table of Contents
Ross Jeffries: "Flowers work wonders on young chicks, especially if you give them to her in front of her friends. Always let her 
friends know (by being, not saying) you are a great guy. Never ever underestimate a girl's desire to make her friends jealous of 
her man. In addition to that, always let her think her friends want you. "Perceived value" is why only some baseball cards are 
worth more that the store you bought them in, when they are all printed on worthless cardboard. And if you want to put a cherry 
on top... you can make slight comments that make her think that just maybe there is the smallest chance you'll go for one of her 
friends if she doesn't do right by you. Or you can go the other way and do things like say, "You friend Sarah has a huge ass... 
you're so much better looking than her" etc. A girl's friends are a fantastic tool."

Judge her by her actions, not her words
Back to the Table of Contents
It happens ever too often. You're with a girl and she SAYS she's gonna have to go home. Once you reach her house, she doesn't 
seem to have the slightest of intention of leaving you. In silent agreement you move on to "take a loot at" your house:) Or she 
SAYS she doesn't sleep with a guy on the first night, or she SAYS it is too soon etc etc. Now these were all positive examples of 
what she SAYS is necessarily not what she wants or eventually DOES:) But nothing to complain about, right?:) 
Wrong. Because the opposite is quite common as well - although she promises this and that, makes excuses, is sorry ("Oh, I'll call 
you", "Oh, I was soo busy, I just didn't have any time!", "I lost your number, what was it?", "We'll do it next Tuesday, I promise!" 
etc) but NEVER delivers - which can leave an AFC hanging on and hoping 'til retirement and then some. 
In the words of Ross Jeffries: "WATCH WHAT YOUR PROSPECTS DO AND NOT WHAT THEY SAY!! Especially with 
women who are excellent excuse makers and bamboozlers. The ONLY real key to a prospect being qualified is THE ACTION 
SHE TAKES! ALWAYS LOOK FIRST AND FOREMOST AT HOW A WOMAN IS TREATING YOU AND IF YOU ARE 
BEING TREATED WITH PRIORITY AND RESPECT. ONLY THEN LOOK AT THE CHARACTERISTICS AND 
QUALITIES YOU LIKE IN THAT WOMAN! 
One of the primary differences between "jerks" and "nice guys" is what they focus on. The jerk is first and foremost focused on 
how he is being treated and each move he makes is put through the test: "will this increase or decrease the priority she gives me?". 
If the answer is decrease... THE JERK DOESN'T DO IT!!! Nice guys (chronic masturbators) by way of contrast, focus on the 
characteristics they like in the girl. They ignore or overlook rude behaviour from her. They act to show their appreciation and 
interest in her rather than to get respect which is why, like Rodney Dangerfield... THEY DON'T GET ANY!!!"

David: oooh, sexy, is it because they are dark and mysterious or because
they are so intense and seductive

intense.  Some even are intimidated by them.  But I hope you are not the
type to be intimidated by dark intense eyes. :-)
Jenny: no, not intimadated at all....  :)
David: excellent, because I like to communicate with my eyes.  I think
they are the windows to the soul
Jenny: yes, me too......many people comment on my eyes
David: and to look into beautiful intense eyes is a very moving
experience.  Have you ever heard of soul gazing?
Jenny: yes I have.

two lovers stare deeply into each others eyes to really become in touch

back to work soon
David: I am sorry to hear that.  I certainly know how that goes.  What
is missing?
Jenny: things haven't been good for a long time...we have just grown
apart....we married too young
David: I know how it is to grow apart.
Jenny: is that what happened in your marriage?  we seem to lead
completely separate lives
David: yes, it is.  I started to mature.  We never really did
communicate.  Later I found that what I needed was emotional and
intellectual intimacy.

David: Yes, I can understand that.  Then there would be no real
passion.  A relationship has to have that true passion, that fire.  And
it is for both people to keep it interesting to keep it exciting
Jenny: yes, but do you think that can last through time?  sometimes....I
think I expect too much.  that this is just the way marriage is
David: I dont know.  I certianly have decided that I will not marry
again.  I would not marry unless I knew that the passion would always be
there.
Jenny: don't blame you....if I divorce ....I will never remarry
David: I sometimes think that I have such high standards now.  I have
come to like my independence.  I have a full rewarding life, and I have

a good career, and I have my sons.
Jenny: I would love some independance
David: I like the freedom.  I hate feeling crowded in
Jenny: me too......
David: I do not want to make the same mistake.  I want to be able to
"run into the water and swim".  I will stay in the water as long as it
feels good.  As long as it is still exciting.
Jenny: my husband is often gone....he calls anywhere from 8 to 10 times
a day....I have to account for all my time to him.....drives me nuts. I
would love to be able to get out and meet some new people.....all of our
friends are stuck in ruts they never discuss anything
interesting....same old thing...day in and out
David: Have you found the computer to help?
Jenny: yes it has helped a good bit....but when he's home I can't get
online much
David: oh yes, that must make you feel really crowded
Jenny: he doesn't understand why I would talk to complete strangers
David: meeting new people is interesting
Jenny: I agree.  but he doesn't talk....and he's not interested in
anything I have to say......
David: that is too bad.  Communication is SO important.  And in a real
relationship, each person would want nothing more than to truly know
what the other person is feeling and thinking
Jenny: yes it is...that's why I think it is pretty much over.  exactly
David: I like to meet people where I feel as if I can really connect
with them
Jenny: me too
David: I mean, like, have you ever met someone, and
 IC pattern here
Jenny: but I am also very cautious.....
David: and you want to feel trust for this person because you know you
really like this person, so you take the time to build the trust.  And
building trust takes being honest with each other while at the same time
being independant.  Do you know what I mean?
Jenny: yes....I know exactly what you mean.  I like to know the other
persons exact feelings, without having to beg them to tell me
David: Oh yes, you want to be with someone who is communicative and
shares their feelings freely.
Jenny: yes, no head games.....no kiddie games
David: and you want to get to the point where you can almost know what
they are thinking, like you could finish their sentences.  And you so
much want to know what this person is feeling, and you want them to know
what you are feeling
Jenny: yes.....you want them to tell you just like you would with them
David: yes.  And then you get to the point where you almost want this
person to feel the same feelings you are feeling.  That is when it is
really special
Jenny: yes, that's when it is really special and most delicate
David: What do you mean by delicate?
Jenny: because that is when you find out if that person is what and who
you think they are
David: yes, I understand.  Say, if I read a poem to you that I had

there because of what I said earlier

could not believe she gave me her phone number.  I did the Blammo

can make her husband dissapear and then she can feel me "penetrating all
throughout" her with a "warm and fuzzy" tingle all throughout her body.
hehe.  After about 30 minutes of conversation, mostly giggling, I told
her: "Well, I promised that I would only keep you for 5 minutes, so I
will let you go."  This one could actually result in a meet.

Act like the two of you have something really special going on
Back to the Table of Contents
Ross Jeffries: "Always act and speak as if you two have something really special going on that can't be found anywhere else. This 
is a good attitude to have all the time. Don't just tell her you do, that gives her a chance to evaluate it and (god forbid) decide that's 
not the case." Say things like you are glad that you do have such a really special thing going and keep elaborating on the glad 
feeling. In the back of her mind she'll accept that you do have a special thing going - she has to in order to understand why you are 
glad (this was also an example of using a presupposition).

Cook for her and "date" at home
Back to the Table of Contents
(Adapted from Don Diebel) 
I have heard over and over again from women how their ideal date involves the man cooking them dinner. 
The best places to pick up women are those where they go to eat. Women are truly slaves to the sensuality of food. If you make a 
dinner, you are providing them with sensual pleasure that they will associate with you. 
Moreover, there is an air of competence and self-assurance that this automatically gives a man in their eyes. Women LOVE 
feeling taken care of and provided for (for obvious evolutionary reasons) and you making them dinner brings all of that. 
Last, but very much not least, this turns your date instead of an encounter in a public place into a private rendezvous in a place 
where you can go… right to bed, should she feel like that:) And believe me, she will:) 
It is disappointing to have the occasional problem where during the date the woman is very much in the mood but during the drive 
back she slips out of the mood, either due to internal considerations or due to something that happens during the drive back etc. 
Having the "date" at home - either by having lunch or dinner there - eliminates the problem:)

When should you call a woman after having sex with her?
Back to the Table of Contents
Don Diebel: "Listen up guys. I can't begin to tell you how important this tip is. After you have had sex with a woman you must 
call her the very next day (this is especially critical for a woman you have just met or very early in a relationship.) So, what's the 
big deal? It's a very, very big deal to a woman giving her body to you. It's very special to her and she expects to hear from you 
the next day. If she doesn't she will feel used and that you don't have any respect for her. The bad thing about this is she may be 
so upset and angry towards you that she won't care to have intimate relations with you again and that's bad news for you. You 
really need to call her the next day just out of respect, if for no other reason. 
There's an exception to the rule. That is if you really were just using her for sex and don't care to see her again. In other words, a 
one-night stand. If it really was just a one-night stand, don't lead her on by misleading her into thinking that you care for her and 
want to start a relationship with her. Just don't call her at all."

Romantic gifts and things to do
Back to the Table of Contents
Don Diebel would suggest using these to win the girl you can't seem to get otherwise. This might be the route to take if you are 
fixated on just one girl alone. And sometimes, you might even get results with these. Most of the time though, you'll probably just 
be wasting your time, money and effort. So rather than trying to win a girl over with these, use them as a reward to a girl that has 
already have proven her worth by getting down with you:) Don Diebel: 
G     Name a star in the universe after her. The acclaimed company, International Star Registry will send her a 12 inch by 16 
inch parchment (no more than 35 letters) and two sky charts showing its position in the galaxy, which is suitable for 
framing. The cost is $48.00 plus $9.00 for shipping & handling. Call 1-800-282-3333 to place your order. 
G     Send her a telegram (yes, a telegram!) telling her how much you care about her, how pretty she is, what a terrific person 
she is, how much you enjoyed your date with her, etc. 
G     Give her a newspaper published on her birthday or on your special anniversary date. Original newspapers from over 50 
cities are available dating back to the year 1880. Each newspaper comes with a protective sleeve. This fantastic and 
memorable gift is available from Newspaper Archives at 1-800-221-3221. The cost is $39.50 plus $6.95 for shipping & 
handling. 
G     Send her a postcard with a romantic thought on it. It can be a simple statement like, "You're such a special lady and I 
wanted to let you know, I'm thinking about you". 
G     Buy a erasable marker and write, " I love you" on her front windshield of her car (um, but don't use it unless you really do 
love her). Also, put a paper towel under the windshield wiper so she can wipe it off. 
G     Buy some "post it notes" and put them on her bathroom mirror where she is most likely to see them. Write on them things 
like, "I love you" or "I can't wait to kiss and make love you to again." 
G     Write her a very romantic love letter and hand it to her and say: "I've written this letter to someone very special in my life, 
could you do me a favour and proof read it for me for any misspelled words before I mail it out?" 
G     Give her a call at work or at home at a time that you know that you will be getting her voice mail and leave her a romantic 
message such as, "I just called to let you know that you're in my thoughts and that I think you are a very special lady." 
G     Take her on a romantic picnic. Bring a blanket, food, flowers, and champagne on ice. 
G     This requires some timing to pull this off. Call the radio station you both listen to and dedicate a song to her. Make sure 
you don't tell her and time it to where you are both listening to the radio station when the request comes on the air. 
G     By her one of those helium-filled "I Love You" or "Happy Birthday" balloons and mail it to her. This will really be an 
unexpected surprise. 
G     I saved the classic romantic gift that always melts a single woman's heart for last. Send her flowers...it never fails to make 
a lasting impression on women. And it's so easy to do. Be sure and say something real sweet with the card that is delivered 
with the flowers. 
Update. From time to time it is good to switch off your usual "I'm an uncontrollable bad-boy and I never supplicate" mode and 
communicate something really special to her. One excellent idea originated by Rod and presented in Clifford's Seduction 
newsletter is the following: if you've had something which is generally accepted as bad or miserable happen to you, call her, e-
mail her or just plain tell her the following: "I may have lost a lot of money at the horse track yesterday / I may have had my car 
stolen the day before / I may have had some other miserable sh_t happen to me quite recently, but I still consider myself damn

lucky for knowing you." She'll have tears of joy and endearment bursting out of her eyes and you can expect her rushing to you in 
no time to "thank you" for that special thought;) Of course, this will be most effective if she already has some affection for you 
(after all, this is the "Handling the girls" section, which assumes that you already "have" the girl in one form or another), but this 
could start the melting of the heart of a more distant female acquintance of yours just as well:) 
You can switch back your "no-supplication" mode later on. But through all your dealings with the opposite sex, remember what 
Jennifer Lopez said in anwser to a question of what kind of a man she wanted: "I want a tough guy, with a soft heart". I'm no 
Lopez-fan, but seems like she has figured out the desires of the most beautiful of girls pretty good (then again, being one herself, 
shouldn't be that hard to do:). 
Update. More romantic things to do. But remember - most of the advice here, especially the money-spending dating-based kind, is 
meant to be used with a woman (or women:) you are already romantically involved with (or in some cases, to put it bluntly - 
sleeping with:) in order to thank her / show her you care / keep the feelings vibrant and well / make her feel good etc. If however 
she feels nothing for you yet, you better not hold your breath when trying out the advice in this article to make the initial approach 
- she _might_ become intrigued, but more likely than not she won't and you'll have her considering your romantic moves only 
"cute" at best (which is why you should look elsewhere in this guide for information on how to approach and initiate, because 
after all, this is the "Handling the girls", not "Approaching the girls" section:). 
G     Write / send her a poem (see Use poetry for more information). 
G     Send her an e-card. Most men don´t care too much for e-cards while most women go gaaga over them, so keep that in 
mind:) 
G     Buy her a special little gift. But be warned - if you buy something expensive, she'll accept it thinking that she's letting you 
"buy" her affection, as opposed to her accepting a non-expensive gift from you, which she'll have to justify to herself as 
caused by her simply liking you. A much more desireable outcome:) ...and less expensive;) 
G     Hide the present somewhere she'll be sure to find it - in the pocket of her coat, in her purse, under her pillow. Upon finding 
it she'll be in tears of endearment for your unselfish affection for her:) 
G     Tell her you'll be late that evening, instead however show up early and take her to a romantic dinner. 
G     Make her a special Valentine's Day web-page. 
G     Write her a letter (a real letter not an e-mail:) and leave it next to her pillow. 
G     Take her to the zoo or a ride in a boat. 
G     Cook a special dinner for her. 
G     Talk to her about your feelings and tell her your fantasies. 
G     Take a long walk in the park together. 
G     Read something romantic or erotic together. 
G     Go somewhere you've always wanted to go together but have never had the time.

She wants YOUR number instead?
Back to the Table of Contents
If things come to a close (see "Closing") and you have already quite bluntly asked for her number and she gives you the "Why 
don't you give me YOUR number?", there are a few things to consider before you comply. 
The most beautiful of girls have a strange little hobby - they collect phone-numbers. AFC's are always there to offer them their 
numbers, so can you blame them?:) And usually there's even a little competition going on between girls, who gets the most phone-
numbers by the end of the evening / week / year. But are they ever gonna use all those numbers? Yes, by making a fire out of all 
those business-cards / napkins at the end of the day / week / year:) 
That's why you shouldn't ever offer your phone number firsthand and that is why you have to pause and think if she asks for your 
number without offering hers. She just might be looking at you thinking "another sucker, let's see if I can extract a phone 
number". Then again, she just simply might not feel comfortable giving you her number, but either way - if you only give yours 
without getting hers in exchange, your chances of ever seeing her again will plummet. 
To salvage the situation, you might show her that you're not just another sucker and you're quite aware of the devious little hobby 
some girls have with respect to phone numbers. She of course will start assuring you, that that is not the case at all with her - tell 
her she can convince you by giving you her number:) Or you can bypass the "naughty girls with naughty hobbies" scenario by 
replying with something as innocent as: "Well I keep a rather hectic schedule, if you call me, you'll probably end up developing a 
long lasting and fulfilling relationship with my answering machine. I'm in and out a lot. However, with your number I could call 
you when I was able to actually talk."

If she still refuses to give you her number
Back to the Table of Contents
If she seems reluctant to give you her phone-number both after structuring an opportunity for her to offer her number and straight-
out asking for it, whatever you do, don't push it. You need to remain polite and safe, like its no big deal if she doesn't want to give 
you her number. But that doesn't mean you'll have to write her off in your mind, here's a strategy of covert persistence by Johnny 
Shack (http://showgirls.com.au): 
"Remember: when approaching a woman you have never met you must not be too overwhelming because it can make her back 
up. If you press the issue much further you will not get anywhere. You must still be persistent however and the best thing you can 
do if you really want her is this - ask her a couple of times about dating you and if this doesn't work change the subject to idle chit 
chat. 
In this chit chat you have 2 goals. 
The first is to make an impression on her what a good guy you are. Women love a guy that can hold some sort of conversation. 
For some reason women think they are more intelligent than the majority of men. Once you realise this, you need to throw this 
thought of theirs out the window and show that you are different. 
The second goal and more important is to find out where she works. People's favorite subject is themselves and you can run a 
conversation purely on questions about her. She will almost always answer at least a few of them. Now two of these questions 
needs to be where does she works and what is her name [note that this is not the AFC-style "sooo... what's your name?" and 
"soooo... where do you work?" line of questioning which leads nowhere and is just testament to the fact that the guy is really 
desperate to have something, anything to talk about with the babe but can't really come up with anything; no, this time the 
questions are actually going somewhere, so hold on:)]. You can say "Oh by the way my name is Johnny". If she doesn't 
automatically tell you her's you should ask for it almost immediately after you have given your's. Now instead of asking a bold 
question like "where do you work" (the reason this is bold is because you are strangers and sometimes a girl will get defensive if 
you ask too many direct questions)you say, "So what industry are you in?". Wait till she answers then say: "Do you like it"? Now 
she may even tell you at this point where or who her employer is but if she doesn't you say: "Oh, where do you work from? I 
know someone that does that and they really love it". Here you are creating an impression that you have something in common 
with her and she will loosen up and think you are safe to be with. You have also made her feel good that her profession is one that 
you respect. 
Now that you know her name and the place she works in you should be the one that makes the move to leave. It is somewhat 
important to be the one to make the move to leave to eliminate a possible feeling in her that you may be pestering her (actually 
she's lucky you are, but strange beings those women are:). Its not vital but a good advantage to have made the move first to leave." 
[And a couple of days later you can phone the operator of the place she works in and ask for her:) Remember to introduce yourself 
and remind her of your encounter a few days before. She might pretend she can't quite remember you or the enconter but you can 
be certain that she does - she's just testing you if her forgetfulness about you can put you off. Just continue with:] 
"I'm the guy who came up to you and asked for your phone number at [whereever]." 
"[a simulated response of being curious of how you found her] And how did you find me here?" 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/stillnonr.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:36:17 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
"Remember how you told me who you work for, well I rang the operator to get your number hoping I would find you there. You 
didn't think I would let you get away that easily did you:) [remember to smile here, she'll "hear" it]?" 
"Well now that I have gone to this much trouble the least you could do is accept an invitation to go out with me next week." 
"[a simulated response of being curious what you have in mind] It would have to be something pretty good to live up to your 
confidence." 
"Well, I've been on some dates in the nicest restaurants and the theatre and many of them have been great. But I've also been on a 
couple of dates where all we did was go and have coffee and they also went great. So it just depends on whether or not we need 
scenery to make our time together fun... and I'm betting we don't. Just leave it to me and I'll think of something we'll both enjoy". 
A word of warning on the last statement - the reason for letting the girl know that you have dated before is to create the image that 
you are a desirable man. It can also put the girl at ease thinking that this idea of going on a date with you is not really a big deal. 
You don't however want to lead the girl to believe that she is not really that important to you and you are just a guy who goes 
from girl to girl, so be careful."

If she asks "Are you trying to seduce me?"
Back to the Table of Contents
Trying the techniques provided here could sometimes result in the woman asking you with a sly smile: 
G     "Are you trying to seduce me?" 
G     "So you enjoy seducing women?" 
G     "Have you broken many hearts?" 
G     "You're a player, aren't you?" 
Neither "Um… yea" nor "OH-NONONONONO!!" are any good to respond to that with. Rather use the excellent aversion 
provided by David Shade. ASF: 
"I enjoy getting to know a woman who is intelligent, natural, and who has a child-like curiosity for life. And when I meet such a 
woman, I would want to enjoy all that life has to offer together with her. And for me there is nothing finer then feeling that 
incredible connection with someone that you feel so very close to." 
You just made her feel even better while avoiding a direct answer. 
Update. NihgLight9 explains, why neither a "yes" or a "no" are good anwers to a question like that. NightLight9, ASF: "I think 
mystery is something you want. Being known as a ladies man is good thing with some women, but not others, but having her 
wonder is probably better than either. If your going after women who are older, more experienced or want to seem older your 
experience would be a real plus. I see a lot of women who want a guy who has had a few partners, but not a lot. They don't want 
to train, but they don't want a "player." Being a player makes them not feel like they are special."

"Have you ever…?" gets busted
Back to the Table of Contents
Partial Estonian translation 
If she says "no" to a "have you ever…?", she's probably young and/or inexperienced. Or wants you to bail:) Well never mind all 
that, you can go on with "well, neither have I, but my friend Sandra told me, that…" and now go in with your original description 
and take her on a trip like she's never been to before:) 
If she just keeps interrupting and blabbering and won't let you take her on a trip, then, at least according to Ross Jeffries, 
switching to third person ("my friend Christina told me, that she feels…") should do the trick as well. That should shut her up, as 
it is supposedly rude to blabber about yourself when your conversation partner talks about a third person. 
Or, use this one: 
"Have you ever met someone (sp) and instantaneously feel such a complete attraction for him (sp), that you feel like you just 
_have_ to do something about it? It's the kind of feeling, that you just have to get near that guy and you know, that even if you 
never see him again, you'll be happy with all your choices and you'll always cherish the pleasant memories?" 
"No" 
"Well that's just so interesting, how different people have different experiences, but my friend Lola was just telling me about an 
experience just like that (now you can go in with describing that experience in even further detail)"

Ejecting
Back to the Table of Contents
You don't always have to close. Ross Jeffries: "I don't need to win all the time; I size up a woman's potential and either go for it or 
move on and cut my losses FAST. Sometimes the best choice is just to say, "adios" and move on. When you realise that you don't 
have to win (or close) all the time, then it takes the pressure off and you become much more relaxed. Ironically, and 
paradoxically, this almost always leads to your winning far more often than you ever imagined possible!!!!" 
In addition to her not rising up to meet your standards, you could be dealing with a woman who for some reason or another simply 
isn't interested. So if you are getting none of the signs of her being interested in you in a reasonable amount of time after a 
reasonable amount of effort on your part to demonstrate personality and entertain her (with the help of using eliciting values, 
patterns, GM style, neghits, telling anecdotes or funny/interesting/intriguing stories etc), you should call it off and eject. 
So many uninitiated chumps just linger on forever in the hopes of getting the girl interested, maybe, somehow, at some point... 
which leaves the bored and frustrated woman no other option than ejecting him herself, often ending the interaction on a bad vibe 
and having wasted both of their times longer than should have been necessary. If however you know when to cut your losses and 
quit, you have a good chance of ending the conversation when everything is still good (leaving an opening for a possible future 
interaction), you show that you are not desperate or overeager making you look more desireable (which will further enhance a 
possibility of a future interaction) and your time will be better spent looking for and interacting with other girls who know to 
appreciate you instead of this one who does not etc. You were only offering her a chance and she failed to grab it, but you have no 
need to push it - you know your stuff is good, so just eject and move on. 
Here's an example ejection phrase suggested by Mystery for use in a club/bar situation: "The night's young... pleasure meeting 
you".

If she doesn't return your phone-calls/e-mails
Back to the Table of Contents
Things are looking grim if she doesn't seem to be returning a phone-call or an e-mail. But not all is lost yet as it all depends how 
you proceed from here. 
One certain way to mess things up is calling / e-mailing her some more with the message being that although you are just slightly 
confused as to why she hasn't answered you yet, its ok anyway, lets try again, "here's my number one more time" etc. Bad. This is 
sure-fire method of losing her. 
Another way to react is not to react at all - you sent your message, she received it, now its her turn to act, and if she doesn't, well, 
too bad. This method lets you keep your integrity and pride, but you could also be losing out on women who either can't seem to 
be able to make up their minds (but beware, they will definetly decide against you once they receive a supplicating follow-up 
message from you!) and/or are the kind of girls, that know to start "behaving" only after having received a few "slaps" from you. 
So if hopes were high (you hit it off well, she gave you her number etc, any signals of possible interest you might have received 
from her will do) but now she seems to have disappeared - show that you WILL NOT TOLERATE such a behaviour, and only 
because you saw some potential for the two of you are you WILLING to give her ONE LAST CHANCE. But if she dares to f_ck 
up again - its bye-bye- and blam!-door-slam-time:) 
A sample e-mail/voice message by ||0_ProB, ASF: "Hi [girls name]. This is [my name]. I wanted to let you know how 
disappointed I was that you didn't call me back. But, since I saw so much potential for us I thought I would give you one last 
chance. So why don't you give me a call." 
Update. This approach also works if she does return your e-mails and phone-calls, but never seems to have time to actually get 
together with you. So if she always seems to have some prior engagements or projects or business or other BS to take care of and 
never time for you, here's an example of a simple and direct message by Maniac High, ASF: 
"Hi xxx 
So are you going to make time to meet me, or are you always busy? I am free Sunday afternoon btw."

If she disrespects you
Back to the Table of Contents
The Returning Fox theory, originated by Ray Parker, explained by NYC, ASF: "At the first sign of disrespect to you OR passing 
up an opportunity to spend time with you, you dump her. When she calls you wanting to go out or something, you tell her that her 
behaviour was unacceptable and that the only way you are going to let her hang out with you again is if she (make up whatever 
shit you want her to do because she broke the rules, fuck, suck, whatever). If all you want from her is a kiss, get that. If all you 
want is for her to dress sexily, make her do that. If she doesn't agree to your terms tell her don't call you again until you are ready 
to meet my demands and HANG UP. The point of returning fox is that she is crawling back to you so you have the POWER in the 
relationship." 
Ross Jeffries suggests issuing a warning at first, which is pretty much the same thing - you have to show that you're serious about 
it. "Don't be afraid to call her on bullshit she might pull. Girls will always test your limits... so the first time they do, call them on 
it. Tell her that you won't put up with that shit and not to do it again. NEVER forget you were born without her. And that there are 
a hundreds more like her and a thousands more that are even better than her." 
Update. Disrespect is also a form of test - she is testing you in order to find out whether you are a supplicating groveling taking-
all-her-crap wussy... or a man. Mr Happy, ASF: "In order to pass such a test (an example of which is cancelling a date), you must: 
1.  Show that you don't lose your temper over it. 
2.  Show that you don't whine like a baby over it. 
3.  Show that it doesn't really phase you. 
4.  Show that you DO find it disrespectful and that you don't tolerate that. 
(4) is the most important point, but you MUST do it in such a way that (1,2,3) are true." 
Update. The Returning Fox theory explained by the originator himself. Ray Parker, ASF: 
"A Returning Fox is one who has shown no previous interest in you or rejected you, but who has "returned" and approached you 
after you have forgotten her. This puts you in a temporary position of power. 
With a Returning Fox, you should ask for whatever it is you want from her at the piont of return. If she does not come across, she 
likely never will, and you can send her packing once again, repeating the process as many times as you have to each time she 
returns. 
For example, if she turned you down for a date, you stopped talking to her, and she now contacts you "just to say hi" just ask her 
out on the spot. Optionally, you can add a reference to how puzzled you are she'd contact you and how you don't really need to 
talk. If she doesn't bail out there, just ask for what you want. 
An aggressive version of this strategy has the man asking for sex or requiring it for her to get back into his life. The theory is she 
must want something out of you to seek you out after rejecting you, and unless she agrees to your terms, she can just go packing 
again. 
The method works very well in many situations. It also has short-term applications for Foxes who ignore you at clubs or parties

The age difference problem
Back to the Table of Contents
First off, you should never anticipate any negative outcomes and that includes anticipating age to be a potential problem. But that 
doesn't mean you shouldn't be minimizing the risks, and that is why this issue of a "yet non-existent problem" is addressed here. 
Secondly, you should be the "perfect man" for the woman of your choice dispite or even "because" of your age (for example, if 
the question of your age does come up, reframe it as a question of whether _she_ is mature enough to be with you). You 
accomplish being a "perfect man" by displaying all the right qualities and none of the wrong ones, either through eliciting values, 
patterning, negging etc, doesn't matter which as long as they do the job - you are the "perfect man" and whatever your age, it'll 
only be to your advantage. 
But that's ideally and we don't live in an ideal world, so sometimes the fate of a relationship might just be determined by 
something as trivial as your age. Although in theory the age of the person to associate with should not be a problem, it is 
undoubtedly a consideration for many women. 
Being "too young" for a woman is a rare occasion and even then rarely a problem, as older women welcome younger guys in their 
arms quite gladly:) Being "too old" for a woman is a much more serious issue, especially with women fresh into womanhood (late 
teens and early to middle 20s). 
So if you anticipate your age might turn into a potential problem, what do you do? Neither do you want to tell her and risk being 
found out to be "too old" nor do you want to lie (even if you don't have a problem being unethical, being found out to be a liar can 
have even worse consequences than being found out to be "too old"), right? 
Here's a suggestion by Mystery, ASF: "Lie - serious. You only have to lie for the first 2 weeks. Then you let them in on the secret 
as if only they know... not even your MOM knows the truth. Girl's alredy fucked you. Then the TRUTH brings you closer. Trust 
me, I KNOW." 
If you prefer to keep your integrity and stay honest, the best way to do it is to reframe the problem of whether you are too old to 
whether she is mature enough. Scot Scinner, ASF: 
Her: Aren't you a little old for me? How old are you? 
Him: 42. 
Her: See, I'm 19. That's too big of a difference in ages. 
Him: It is not a question of the differences in our ages, as it is a question of whether or not you are mature enough to become 
involved with me. 
Her: Yeah, right. (or) I mature enough...blah, blah, blah. 
Him: When you GO INSIDE and THINK about the advantages, of being with an older man, if you could just DO IT NOW, you'll 
see that there are plenty [continue with patterning]. 
Update. Razor505, direct contribution: "First you always wait for her to bring up the difference (you must know the difference i.e.

imagine how either way it goes we both win, right? (keep talking dont give her a chance to respond) I mean if we just become 
good friends we win right (don't give her a chance to respond) or if we become more we still win right (keep going) or if we go 
each our own ways we still win right?" And instanly ask something about her. It is very important to say all this as off hand as you 
can."

just might start making passes on you and if you keep on just ignoring her and pushing her away, it'll make her crazy and 
eventually you can do whatever you want with her. But don't use it unless really nothing else has worked so far. Remember, she

If she says: "Let's just be friends", aka LJBF's you
Back to the Table of Contents
Ideally, you should never get to a point where a girl is forced to "LJBF" you - that is when she doesn't want you but you don't 
seem to be able to take a hint. First of all, you should be able to make most any girl want you anyway, and secondly, should she 
really be disinterested, you should have moved on long before she has a chance to "LJBF" you. If however you still happen to 
wind up in a mess like that, this is what Don Diebel suggests (he should know, he is the "dating guy":). 
Don Diebel: "If a girl ever blocks advancing the relationship by saying, "No, let's just be friends," say, "No, I have lots of friends. 
See you later." By continuing this type of relationship, you portray yourself as someone who has nothing better to do than hang 
around with a girl who is not that interested in you. The relationship will never get to where you want to go - to bed for some 
romance, passion, and sex. And even if by some miracle the relationship did advance to the bedroom, she would be doling out sex 
- dictating the where, when and how much. If she wants to cut you off at any time, she can and you have to accept it because that 
is the implied agreement from the start. She is in complete control, hence, she will never be satisfied with you. 
If, on the other hand, you walk away from this relationship, you have established that you are the type used to leading a 
relationship, you have plenty of other girls willing to take you on your terms, and she is losing out. We have seen cases where a 
man will completely turn around the relationship as soon as a girl sees that he is willing to "walk" rather than accept something 
that is not on his terms. 
When do you give up on a girl? When do you decide that a relationship is not advancing? When you are the only one making an 
effort to keep it advancing. If she is not putting energy in to you, take the hint and move on to the next prospect. Don't stay where 
you're not appreciated. If this situation does occur, try to figure out why. How did she perceive you? What turned her off? Learn 
from your mistakes." 
Update
What to do, if you can see that you're approaching LJBF-land with a girl. Glenn Durden, ASF: "Completely and totally cut off all 
contact with her for a few months. When you come back, you can almost start from scratch. More of a stranger, less of a "close 
friend"."

But I really want this girl!
Back to the Table of Contents
No, this is exactly the wrong attitude. If she is your only prospect, the one you're thinking about day and night, you keep playing 
different scenarios of approaching her and making her like you in your mind over and over again - that's called desperation. And 
it'll show. She's gonna see it (consciously or subconsciously) and nothing repels girls more than a desperate guy. That's why you 
have to be chasing multiple girls at any given time, so if one of them gives you trouble, the heck with her, you have other girls 
wanting to be down with you:) 
But the really good part is this - the ones giving you trouble can sense instantly that you're not phased by it, you're displaying none 
of the usual signs of despair, heart-ache, supplication etc. You just don't give a damn, you just don't have time to give a damn, 
you're got too much action going on elsewhere. Guess what?:) This is exactly what suddenly makes you desirable in their eyes:) 
Mystery: "Notice how a man who gets girls gets MORE girls while a man who has nothing continues to get nothing?". 
A standard question in ASF: "I really-really want this girl, she is so special, what can I do to make her want me!?"
A standard answer in ASF: "Make love to at least 10 other girls, then see if you still want this girl and think she is so special:)" 
Update. Mr Happy, ASF: "Do not ever fixate on any one woman, it turns her off. To lay her, she must believe that you like to fuck 
women, that you would like to fuck her, but that you don't NEED her because you have all kinds of women all over you. 
[The good way to gain such an attitude is to] go out and approach 12 women a day, 4 days/nights a week. That's 48 women a 
week. Your skills will undergo massive improvement with such practice. You should always be able to blow off any woman to go 
pick up another one. If you won't put in the effort, you will not get the results. And if you won't even put in the effort, then you are 
a pussy and evolution is weeding you out. If you DO put in the effort, you WILL improve and get great results." 
Update. Allen Thompson, Don Juan newsletter: 
"Obsessing about a particular girl, and whether or not she likes you, is the KISS OF DEATH! If you're worrying about whether a 
girl likes you or not, chances are she doesn't - or rather, SHE WON'T. She won't because your "worry" and your obsession with 
what she thinks of you will actually push her away. When you let yourself fall into the "obsession" trap, you begin to analyze 
everything your dream girl does, every word she says, every move she makes... and try to relate them all to you. She smiled at you 
- she didn't smile at you. She emailed you - she didn't email you. She returned your call - she didn't return your call. Confusion, 
frustration, and anxiety result." 
And not just for you. If she comes to know that you're obsessing about her, she will also know, that you'll be analysing her every 
move in relation to you. Which will invariably make her uncomfortable. She can't be herself anymore, she can't relax and feel free 
in your proximity/company. Knowing that you're obsessing, she will feel anxiety, discomfort and maybe even fear when you're 
around. And on all occasions, she will want to get away, further away from the source of her anxiety, further away from you. 
Well, but there's this rather slight and slim possibility, that she's also obsessing about you, right? I mean, people sometimes do end 
up with people who have initially been obsessed about them, and they live happily ever after, right? Yeah right, in fairy-tales they 
do. In real life however, if you want her, do something, anything, preferably of course something suggested elsewhere in this 
guide, and quick. But once you let yourself become obsessed and act under the influence of that - you're doomed. And this is also 
where the standard ASF suggestion of "spend some intimite time with ten other girls before you get back to this "special" girl 
again" stems from. Because once you're accomplished that, you'll ease up on the obsession, you will feel relaxed and comfortable

(and as moods are contagious, so will she), she in turn will be more comfortable about getting close to you, and now that you're 
filled with calm confidence ("heck, even if she doesn't dig me enuff, I've just been with ten girl and can get laid at will anyway, so 
let's just have fun with this") you will be able to handle her more proficiently etc.

Falling in love vs being a player
Back to the Table of Contents
The question of falling in love is tricky for everyone and the PUA is no exception. He is however less likely to develop a pathetic 
and desperate fixation commonly associated with falling in love. It can happen, but its effects (jealousy, depression etc) are far 
less severe. They just don't have any room to develop and aren't given enough time to reach their full potential. 
The word polyamorous has been coined which is probably the closest match to describing how a seducer is in love - he is simply 
in love with many women at once. Being in love with one girl at a time, especially if it is a one-sided feeling, has you fixated on 
this one girl, thus giving off vibes of desperation, paralysing your ability to think clearly, feeling constant fear of being rejected 
and lowering your self-esteem when your feelings are not returned - all of which will repel a girl even further away from you thus 
forming a self-reinforcing downward cycle. Being in love with many girls at a time (or at least interested in, if they've not yet 
given you cause to reward them by showing any deeper affection and making them your girlfriends:) has the effect of letting you 
keep your thinking more coherent, remain confident because you acknowledge and understand that there are more girls than just 
this "one", all the while being able to guide her feelings for you - to match and even exceed the intensity of feelings of those being 
in love if you choose to. And your confidence and coolness about these matters attracts girls (as opposed to desperation, which 
repels) thus forming another, but this time a positive self-reinforcing cycle. 
Some say that the ideal is still a one-on-one relationship full of complete and unconditional love. I agree with the latter part of the 
assertion - complete and unconditional love truly is an ideal. But I have to disagree with the assertion of one-on-one situations 
being the ideal. The biggest argument in support of the one-on-one ideal is that a family needs both a mother and a father for the 
children to be able to model the world through them and be supported financially. Should one of the parents be led astray by some 
parallel relationships, this could end up with the family being broken. So to protect the integrity of the family, all relationships 
should be strictly one-on-one and no polyamorous relations are to be allowed. But inherently it shows the weakness of the one-on-
one ideal - for it is exactly this very same ideal that forces one of the parents to choose, which on of his/her relations to make that 
ideal one-on-one relationship, and should he/she opt for a new one, the old one will be broken, and thus will also be broken the 
very values which the one-on-one ideal was supposed to protect. 
Ok, this example was the extreme of the extreme - marriage, family, children - something that most of you probably don't want to 
be associated with quite yet:) Notice however how the exclusivity of love ideal fell fat on its face in it:) 
The other argument is, that the exclusivity of someone's affection is supposed to give added value to that affection. The truth is - 
yes, exclusivity will bring added value… for a while, but soon enough, this added value will subside into routine and being taken 
for granted and will eventually degenerate into boredom. Whereas non-exclusivity can help keep things fresh for a very long time 
indeed:) 
A one-on-one relationship is actually more a matter of comfort and traditions - after years of fruitless pursuits and painful 
rejections, you've finally found someone you like and someone who likes you back, a companion, with whom you can have your 
needs of giving and receiving love fulfilled. You sigh a sigh of relief and settle in. You're an AFC headed for marriage:) 
One more argument defending the one-on-one relationship is that love in its nature is exclusive and you cannot for example be in 
love with two different people at a time. (I do admit, that loving and being in love with somebody are not quite the same, but 
neither do the proponents of the one-on-one relationship seem to notice a difference - they force their standards upon everybody). 
This is one truly weak argument and can only derive from either such people's lack of experience, denial of having felt that way or

simple inability to feel that way, which they then extend and attribute to the whole world. But sooner or later even they shall have 
to acknowledge the possibility of being able to share love with many people, at least to some degree. Or do they love their parents 
just one at a time? Or do you plan on loving their children one at a time? Of course not. They feel love for all of them - maybe 
more for some and less for others, but definitely not "only one at a time". They might of course argue, that that kind of love is 
"different", but I'd say its' different on just three aspects - more empathy, less intimacy and no choice in who the objects of your 
affection are. Other than that, it is love nevertheless. 
I want to stress, that there's nothing wrong with monogamous relationships, falling in love in the classic, desperate way or getting 
married. Too often however people do these things because they don't think they have a choice. But then, when it turns out, they 
could actually have had a choice and there were even better options available, they close their eyes and start preaching on the 
benefits and superiority of their choice over other options and the supreme and divine wisdom of the choice they actually made in 
ignorance. 
So either seduce to your heart's content or fall in love and get married or become a munk to lead a life of celibacy - just know your 
options and make a knowledgeable choice:) 
Epilogue 
As for why I even bothered to discuss the relative benefits of being a "player". Life's too short - not that you should taste as many 
girls as you can, but at least you shouldn't waste your time with the girls you can't have. Being a player let's you see that and move 
on, being an AFC however has you banging your head against the wall until one of them crumbles (well… walls have been 
known to crumble from time to time too:). 
An excerpt from "Dumb and Dumber" to illustrate this:) 
Jim Carrey: So… waddaya think? What are the chances of the two of us being together? 
HB: (silence) 
Jim Carrey: One in two? One in three? …One in five? 
HB: Um… rather… one in a million. 
Jim Carrey: (with a big smile:) So… ya'r saying…. THERE'S A CHANCE:)))????

If she says she has a boyfriend
Back to the Table of Contents
Don't ever, never, ever ask if she has a boyfriend! Maybe she does, maybe not - so what, who cares? 
Maybe she does, but wants to have a little fun - your prompting about a possible borefriend will put her off the mood, she'll move 
on to another guy and get what she came looking for anyway. Or maybe she does, but is also pretty curious about you and 
wouldn't want the existence of a boyfriend scare you away. She might even be considering dumping him in favour of you. Once 
you've extracted that information from her however, she might just write you off in her mind. 
If however she blurts it out without prompting, it still doesn't mean anything. Maybe she really thought she wanted to scare you 
away, but she really didn't know what she was doing:) Take it humorously, be light-hearted and give her another chance:) 
Examples: 
HB: Sorry, but I have a boyfriend.
You: *Laughing* Hey, I just met you and you are already telling me about your problems:)? 
ASF: "If I ask her to meet me somewhere and she says "But I have boyfriend", I answer with "If he makes you happy, then you 
could bring him along." Then I ask, "Does he make you happy?". I decide if I should follow up based on the response. Most have 
had some complaints about him which gives me something that I can work with later and a topic of discussion." 
Update. Maniac High, ASF: "[One reason she might be saying she has a BF is that] she really does have a BF, likes you, but 
doesn't want to feel guilty about cheating on her BF. This is classical "chick logic" at work here and is good, because it means 
you are on your way to a fuck, even in spite of the BF... Basically this happens because she thinks that if she tells you about the 
BF now, she can relax and let you you fuck her anyways, since its "not her fault now" that she fucked you, because, she *did* 
tell you about the boyfriend, and you ignored it, ie. she "had no choice in the matter"." 
Update. Use this one if the boyfriend comes up for the first time in the conversation. If she keeps insisting on it, move on to any 
other boyfriend smashing-bashing technique described in this guide. Mystery, ASF: 
HER: I have a boyfriend. 
ME: That's nice ... so anyway .... 
REASONING - ignore the topic and so will she. 
Update. Aaron R. Kulkis, ASF: 
Her: "I have a boyfriend" 
You: "Thats *good* - I'm not really looking for a girlfriend either:)" 
Comments by Alphahot1, ASF: "Try to say it as congruently as possible and with no sarcasm. Now you have put her a little more 
at ease and consequently, she will be more open to you. NOW, proceed to SS the fuck out of her with everything you can hit her 
with. After about 15 or 20 minutes, you won't have to worry about any boyfriend. Because she will now want *YOU* to be her 
boyfriend!! Plain and simple.

Alienating the boyfriend in her mind
Back to the Table of Contents
Taken from "Sweep women off their feet...": 
"We all know that not one person in this world is perfect. If you begin talking about relationships, feel free to discuss the little 
things that bother people in a relationship in general and later get her to give you examples of some of the things that bug her 
about her boyfriend or husband. At first she may not say much, but if she can relate to the day to day problems in a relationship 
that you describe in general the more likely it is for her to agree with you on some points. When she does you can get her to be 
more specific. Once there's a crack, amplify it. 
At first sympathize with the situation and somehow try to find the positive in it, and how her boyfriend or husband can justify that 
particular behavior through love and so on. But slowly and surely as the negatives of the situation are amplified, abandon your 
understanding for her boyfriend/husband's behavior and begin to offer her an alternative. Tell her how you think things should be 
and make sure they favor her. Begin to act exactly as she would love her husband to act while still intensifying her disappointment 
(if not anger) with him. Now's the time to be there for her, and once you've successfully alienated her boyfriend or husband (even 
if only for the moment) begin your seduction from either the interest or even desire stage. When it comes to the last stage of your 
seduction, try not to bring up the boyfriend again unless she's the one who brings it up, and if she does, just re-enforce that 
alienation. 
Along the same lines, when you are trying to alienate the boyfriend or husband, you should never say that they are bad and you 
are good, just show them how you think a wonderful relationship should be and how certain behavior exhibited by their 
boyfriends/husbands is at the very least questionable in a loving relationship. Questioning specific behavior is the easiest and 
fastest way to cast doubt over the entire relationship or at the very least his feelings for her. 
For example, if a girl goes out with her friends on a girl's night out without her boyfriend, just question his desire to be with her. 
At first she will be happy and loving towards him because he is understanding and giving her the independence she needs, but 
when you question his motives for it she will begin to question them too. 
"I know it's great to be able to go out with your girlfriends and have a good time, but would he not want to be here with you and 
enjoy your company and perhaps dance with you and kiss you at the right moment when a slow dance ends?" 
"We both need some independence and he understands that I need to see my friends once in a while too." 
"I understand independence and it's great, but being as beautiful as you are, is he not a bit jealous not knowing how many guys out 
there might try to pick you up, or does he not care about that possibility?" 
"He trusts me." 
"Does he encourage you to go out with your girlfriends often? You know my first impression would be that you are such a lucky 
girl to have such a wonderful boyfriend/husband, but my nature just won't let go of certain things that sound off tiny little alarms. 
Have you ever called him on your night out? Is he even there, or is this a good chance for him to go out with his buddies too? 
"Even if he is, what's wrong with that? I'm out here with my friends?" 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/alienating.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:36:38 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
"Yes, but you're not guys. Do all his buddies have girlfriends and just go out for a drink? Or do they go out to pick up some girls? 
I'm not saying that he would do that, but if his buddies are, what exactly is he doing with them? 
I must say that I admire that you have such an open relationship, I don't know if I could let you go if I had a girlfriend like you. I 
think I'd want to spend as much time with you as possible. How can anybody ever get tired and need a break from seeing you and 
whispering sweet little nothings in your ears? I guess I just don't understand, but it sounds like he must be a great guy. I'm sure 
that he is the kind of guy who would…(describe the most wonderful and romantic things a guy could possibly say and do to a 
woman), otherwise I know he wouldn't stand a chance of being with a girl like you. I know you must be the kind of girl who 
wouldn't settle for anything less and would never expect anything less from a guy. You are so lucky. 
I'll tell you, a guy who would ever take you for granted even in the smallest way would have to be too selfish to even realize what 
he's got. But I know someone like that would definitely lose out to the competition because I'm sure any red-blooded guy in this 
world would do just about anything to be with a girl like you, and I'm not just saying that, I can point out a number of guys that 
have been just staring at you all night. 
It must be such a wonderful feeling to know that you are admired, loved and appreciated isn't it? And I'm not talking about those 
guys, but the one at home, who in my mind questionably still isn't here with you." 
If she goes to the phone at any time throughout the evening, that's a good sign. She's starting to question some of those things too 
and is looking for reassurance hoping that he is home. If he is home, chances are that the conversation will not go very well 
especially if he can hear the loud party atmosphere in the background. In addition if you were able to plant even the smallest seeds 
of jealousy in her mind, she will act in a way that would cause him to be defensive on the phone. If for some reason they have 
even the smallest fight, you've got a chance. Start treating her like she would like her boyfriend to treat her, and work on those 
desires and romance."

Boyfriend-smashing techniques
Back to the Table of Contents
by NYC 
Whether she has a boyfriend or not is IRRELEVANT... UNTIL you decide you are going to fuck her. Then you either need to 
bring him up and press her for the information where her relationship is lacking OR make her recall her boyfriend and how good 
he makes her feel and usurp the feelings for yourself. 
If she injects the boyfriend into the conversation unsolicited, a simple diversion to whether or not she plans to marry him might be 
in order. I always use it if I decide NOT to bring him up and get her to talk about him favorably. 
Another thing I like to use if she is DEFENSIVELY bringing up her boyfriend is "so where is he tonight?" If she doesn't have a 
good excuse like he is working late because he is a stock trader, I play her into a "he's cheating on you right now" mentality. 
Chicks can't stand that. PLUS they have to carry this with them from now on. I break down their BELIEF in what their boyfriend 
TELLS THEM he has to do. 
Whether they believe me or not is irrelevant because they don't know me. All they do know is that they now have an alternative 
version of what their man is doing tonight and every night that he is not with her. After that sinks in, I talk about wasting time and 
wasting your life and passing up opportunities to do what you REALLY WANT TO DO just because of some bullshit you told 
someone one day, like "I am only going to fuck you" when they are out doing whatever they want. Then I bring up chicks that got 
cheated on and how stupid they felt when they were telling me about how they got played:) 
You can see how it just strings along and breaks their BELIEF in their man. adding the effects of alcohol, you often get a 
flirtatious effect from the chick deciding to "get him back for cheating" when he was at work the whole time:) 
Use ex-boyfriends: the chick had a BF, but wasn't satisfied with him. I took her back through a meta-state tour of her ex-
boyfriends. The guys that really turned her on I brought her back to frquently. Basically, her boyfriend paled in comparison, and 
she remembered how HORNY she used to feel with guys and she just doesn't get that with him anymore. Suddenly, she wants a 
little kino... shoulder massages, back rubs, holding her from behind and kissing her neck... 
Basically, if she claims a BF and that doesn't make you want to bail immediately... make her remember past boyfriends... make 
her remember that she broke up with them... make her remember that they were better lovers than her current BF... make her long 
for guys that she CAN'T POSSIBLY GET HER HANDS ON but she remembers being in their arms and how much she wanted to 
please them and how much she wanted them to touch and please her. Once she realizes that boyfriends are a passing thing, she 
will NOT want to waste the opportunity to get a blessed release from all the sexual feelings you have just aroused in her... and 
YOU'RE IT!:)

Boyfriend Destroyer patterns
Back to the Table of Contents
Pattern 1. 
Ross Jeffries: 
"You're sort of seeing someone? As you're only sort of seeing that image of him in your mind, notice what happens as that image 
gets smaller and darker only as fast as an image of you and me being together having lots of fun gets big and brighter right there 
in its place. 
Now as you look at that picture right there, doesn't it seem like something you really want. Oh yea, in fact, doesn't it seem like 
something that's already happened and there's no point resisting it cause it's too late to do anything but smile that smile of deep 
satisfaction and know this is going to be incredible. Oh yea, great, so when can I pick you up?" 
Pattern 2. 
Ross Jeffries: 
"Well, look I really enjoyed this, and I'd like to talk to you again sometime? Can I call you? You have a boyfriend? 
Well, I have to admit I'm disappointed, I have to respect that you're in a relationship. But let me ask you a something. How 
surprised would you be to find yourself actually looking forward to spending a little time with me? I mean, maybe to the point 
where you could imagine us over coffee, laughing and having the best of time, and you starting to feel really comfortable with it? 
As you think about it like that, doesn't seem natural to meet like Monday or Tuesday for coffee? 
Pattern 3. 
What a never-ending monologue:) But if she's a listener, you'll do fine:) Ross Jeffries: 
(This one would require that you already talked about sub-modalities beforehand) Oh you have a boyfriend, I understand, and you 
know, I have respect for that, I do have to appreciate it cause its rare to find someone who you can be with and that's a cool thing. 
But I also know that you can be in a relationship one minute and the next minute, you don't know what has happened. I'm sure you 
have experienced that, haven't you? Yea, so well lets take this guy for a minute, lets imagine this guy (point to the palm of your 
hand), lets say you're going out with him and then you break up with him. Have you ever broken up with someone? 
And then you suddenly start to look back on the relationship and notice the things he does that you can't stand. Like maybe he 
leaves the cap off the toothpaste, or he ignores you or does any of those other things that generate all those feelings of being let 
down, bored or disgusted or all those things that represent that in him and you get to the point where you just can't stand it 
anymore. You got to break up with him. Did that ever happen? 
Oh yea! Maybe you even look back on the relationship and you become obsessed with the things you hate about him. Till you get 
to the point where you think to yourself, god, what did I ever see in him. Has that ever happened to you?

How to Lay Girls Guide
You know, the whole thing is, that entire process can take months and months, but I'm wondering what would it be like if that 
entire process were to take place instantaneously in your mind. It would be like if you try to (wave your hands in her face) see his 
image in your mind, you couldn't do it. It would be like something unknown was simply breaking it into pieces, you know. Its like 
you couldn't see his image in your mind anymore and that's the first sign that will let you know that you're already starting to find 
him a lot less important (cover the palm of your hand). 
Now that's a sad thing when you put someone behind you, but its also a happy thing. Cause when that happens you open yourself 
up to someone new (sp). You allow someone new to come inside . . your sphere of influence and penetrate your thinking. Now 
that's a great thing to make that connection and only feel good right now. 
(transitioning to Incredible Connection) You know, when you connect with someone its like there's a cord of light going from you 
to them. And as that just starts to glow with the warmth of that connection, and as the depth rich warmth of it just spreads to 
where you want it to go, its like you want to create an opening, an opening for pleasure an opening for connectiveness and desire. 
I mean, what's it like when you're with someone who oooohhhhh, you know, really knows how. Isn't that a great thing. Now you 
may be surprised to find that as I talk about that, you start to have certain images and I don't know what those might be and I 
won't ask you cause the content might be a little personal, but as those pictures get bigger and brighter oooohhhh you start to add 
in those sounds that make you feel perfect. You may begin to realize there's something you really want and you got to have it. I 
mean, have you ever woken up and really had to have something. What's it like when you want something so bad that you just feel 
filled with the desire in a way that just makes you feel perfect. 
Sometimes when someone has upset you, its best to forget about them. You know when you think about that, when you forget 
about something or someone where does it go? Like someone you use to know a long time ago, or what about something you 
wanted to be when you were a child and it never came to fruition. Have you ever used Windows, 95 or 98 / a Macintosh 
computer? Do you know how you put something in the trash? Now try to remember something you wanted to be when you were a 
child... Was there something you wanted to have or something you wanted to be? (she might answer "a dancer" or "a model" or 
"an actress"). Ok, you could still become one some day, but point to where in your mind you see that idea right now. That's like 
the recycle bin in Windows / trach can on a Macintosh! (Or just imagine, if you were to put something in the trash in your mind, 
just where would that trash thing be located). 
So just take all those thoughts about him, if fact, you may find that the image of him, for some unknown reason, powers itself, 
sneaks itself, down there and stays there. And any thoughts you might have of not listening to me and obeying everything I say, 
you may be surprised to find them going right down there as well. That's right. (Point to where her boyfriend's picture has moved) 
Seeing it from this perspective, I invite you to notice how you might feel - you were so wrong about this guy. Have you ever 
thought you loved someone and then you suddenly realise for some unknown reason you deeply love someone else (point) much 
much more. And when that's happening its a sad thing in a way, but also, its a good thing..." 
Pattern 4. 
This one is easy (equals good:), especially when compared to the hog above. 
Kevin Kupal, mindlist: 
"It's amazing how YOUR MINE works you know. I mean, people never really realize how to control their emotions, but it can so 
very easily done! Wanna bet? Hokay... 
Well... remember a time when you were utterly humiliated... when you just wanted to bury your head in the ground and 
disappear... as if the whole world were laughing at you... do you feel that now? (wait)... okay... 
Imagine that I can take that feeling, collect it all in my hand (wave in front of her chest, as if collecting waifs or whiffs of air), 
take it all out. and quash all of that bad feeling in my hand... concentrated in all its bad emotions in this very small space, and I 
take this away from you (take hand away). Makes you feel so much better now, does it not ? 
Her: Yeah...

NOW, can't you see... it's easy to make people FEEL VERY GOOD. WITH ME, it's a natural thing to do. Can KEVIN (point to 
the hand with the bad feelings) do that? 
Pattern 5. 
Not really a destroyer, but will probably get her thinking about the status of her borefriend. 
Jake Thomson, ASF: 
"You have a boyfriend. Well I must stay I certainly disappointed, but I know how nice it is to have someone who can fulfill your 
every desire, exactly the way you need it fulfilled, who can communicate with you at the deepest core of your being, exactly the 
way you need to be communicated with. And since it's obvious that's the case here, might I inquire when is the wedding? I mean, 
since he's meeting EVERY DESIRE you have, exactly the way YOU NEED IT FULFILLED, you must be planning on marriage, 
right. That way you can spend the REST OF YOUR LIFE, just with him, forever and ever and ever. That's so sweet. [if she 
mumbles "um... no wedding yet", transition to a close]" 
Update. Pattern 6. 
From an unknown source: 
Her: Well, I'd like to go out with you but I'm seeing someone. 
You: Right, I appreciate you being straight with me. Thank you. And as much as I wish it weren't the case, I gotta tell I also 
respect relationships. 
You: But you know, it's interesting, you can be in relationship one minute, and the next minute, you don't know what's happening. 
I'm sure you've experienced that, HAVEN'T YOU? 
Her: Yes I have. 
You: Its like you're going along and you suddenly start to FEEL UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHERE THE WHOLE THING IS 
GOING? 
Her: Yeah, sure. 
You: What's the guys name your going out with? 
Her: Bill. 
You: Right, so you're going out with Bill (point to your right hand) and you're enjoying it and all...and then say for some reason 
you break up. You ever BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE (point to palm of right hand) and you go through that period of mulling it 
over and you NOTICE THE PATTERNS IN HIM THAT RUINED YOUR LAST RELATIONSHIP... OR MAYBE YOU 
START TO LOOK AT HIM IN A WAY THAT REALLY MAKES HIM A LOT LESS ATTRACTIVE IN YOUR MIND? 
You: I mean it's so weird how the mind does all this stuff, but what I'm curious about is what would it be like for a person if that 
entire process were to TAKE PLACE INSTANTANEOUSLY (snap your fingers in her face) in someone's mind? It'd be like 
(wave hand in her face) you couldn't see his picture any more in your mind. Every time you tried it'd be like something was just 
WIPING IT RIGHT OUT. And that's how you'd know that you've already started to FORGET ALL ABOUT HIM, to MAKE 
HIM MUSCH LESS IMPORTANT. 
You: Or you know, is there someone you used to date, but now they're way out of your mind... you haven't even thought about 
them in a long time? Yeah? Well as you remember him, point to where you see his picture? 
You: Right there? Isn't that interesting? So if you were to, FORGET ABOUT THIS GUY (hold your palm to where she pointed) 
it'd be like he GETS STUCK IN THE SAME PLACE. Now imagine Bill in the place you see the other guy. I think that, from this

perspective, you REALLY CAN SEE SOMETHING IN HIM YOU DON'T LIKE... something that over time, would really cause 
you TO DUMP HIM. 
You: And when that happens it's a little sad, but its also a good thing, because it allows you to CREATE AN OPENING FOR 
SOMEONE NEW. ME, I know that's how it CAN GO DOWN ON ME (point to your groin).

Fun and games
Back to the Table of Contents
The kissing bet. An old trick, you can also use it with or without the GM technique. ASF: "Tell the girl that you will bet her a 
dollar (or a drink is nice) that you can kiss her without using your lips or your tongue. Girls usually think (know) that your up to 
something, so sometimes it takes a little convincing to get them to take the bet. They will take it about 1/3 of the time. If the girl is 
a good friend and she doesn't take the bet, say "Ok. Fine...Just check out this trick I learned...you can use it to make money off 
people," then play it off like your doing her a favour by showing her this (Trust me you are). Then if she accepts the bet or you 
offer to show her "the trick" do this: Say: "Ready...Watch this!" Then move in like you are going to kiss her on the lips. Ok this is 
fucking important. When you reach the point of no return you absolutely MUST lay the smoothest and I mean the smoothest 
smack on her she has ever experienced. Then say "God Damn you're a good kisser!...I guess I owe you a buck!" If your kiss is 
smooth enough this will most definitely lead to more kissing and maybe even a child if your a real asshole. (If you need a good 
line here say "I don't think that kiss was worth more than 50 cents, you owe me another")." 
Osama - the king. Estonian translation. A Japanese version of truth or dare. Everyone shows their hand with the amount of 
extended fingers forming a number from one to five. The numbers are added up and the resulting numbers are counted clock-wise 
from the last "king" (or from the one the added up the numbers if the game has just begun). The one who ends up with the final 
number will be the next "king" and can "truth or dare" any other two players to do anything:) 
A-hole + truth or dare.
ASF: "Remember how easy it was to kiss girls playing truth or dare in high school? Well, guess what... it still works with college 
age women... Except now you're fucking! My wingman and I use this everytime we bring girls back to my house. We always end 
up banging our chicks of choice, but the best part is you get to do freaky shit with both of them! Not to mention that the lesbian 
action (unavoidable when playing with me!) is a great way to psyche yourself up for some serious sex. 
We make a plan about what and who we are gonna do before we start and prep each other with good dares and truths. DO NOT 
play this without whip cream... this is the most important accessory you will need. You will be amazed when you see how turned 
on a girl can get just by liking whipped cream off her stomach. Start off with little stuff like kisses and then move up to licking 
whipped cream off nipples, dryfucking, lapdances, and the closer... Dare your wing to go in a room with one of the chicks for 5 
minutes and see what happens. At this time grab the other girl and wear out your carpet. At this point the girls will be so turned on 
from the licking and kissing that you can basically do whatever you want with them. When you're alone in the room you can be 
like, "I dare you to let me come in your mouth" etc. 
Sounds great so far right? But your worried about how to get the game started. You cant just say, "Ok, time for truth or dare". To 
the girls it sounds more like, "Ok, time for us to use you for our sexual entertainment." You have to sneak them into it. My recipe 
goes like this: start off with the greatest drinking game of all time, Asshole, to get them nice and liquored up. Then move on to the 
game I'm about to describe. 
Throw out any cards below an 8. Take the rest and spread them in a circle around the biggest cup you can find. Now you take 
turns drawing cards. 
8 = Band Names. Go around the table saying band names. Each name has to start with the last letter of the previous name. For 
instance, I say Vanilla Ice, the next person says Eric Clapton, next person says Nine Inch Nails. If you cant think of one in ten 
seconds then you drink and the next person draws a card. 
http://tranceboy.fws1.com/fungames.htm (1 of 2) [8/3/2002 9:36:44 PM]

How to Lay Girls Guide
9 = Truth. You can ask whoever you want. 
10 = Person to the left drinks for 5 sec. 
Jack = Dare. Whoever you want. 
Queen = Everyone drinks for 5 count. 
King = Fill up the huge cup with 1/3 of the way full with whatever you are drinking. The person who draws the last king has to 
pound whatever nasty mixture ends up in the cup. After a few rounds you will start running out of band names since you can't say 
the same one twice. Wait till one of the girls cant remember a band name then say, "Lets just play truth or dare". They will 
happily agree if your dares and truths were exciting and getting them horny. 
My wing and I played this thursday night with 3 girls and 4 guys. At the beginning of the night the girls actually asked me if they 
could stay over so they didn't have to drive home drunk! After much a serious truth or dare session with tons of sexual acts, I 
dared my wing to go in a room for 5 min with one of the chicks and see what happens. They never came out. It was getting late 
and I had to work the next morning. I tossed the other two girls some blankets and said, "You two can sleep in my bed if you 
want, but dont be thinking we're gonna hook up and shit cause I really gotta get some sleep." 10 minutes later one of the girls 
cruises into my room, jumps in bed with me and starts kissing me. She was about an 8 but it was 3:30 so I told her I had to sleep 
and to leave her number and we would continue this the next night. In the meantime my brother has gotten the 3rd chick into his 
room and my other friend is spanking hank in my bathroom. 
I've never played this game before without all the girls willing to bang at the end, whether they have boyfriends or not. I got the 
idea a year ago when I was asking a girl if she had ever had a lesbian experience. She told me that the only time she ever did was 
in a crazy game of truth or dare when she got dared to eat some girl out for 5 min. Neither of these girls were bi before it 
happened. This just goes to show that the possibilities are endless!!!"

Play a game of Crash and Burn
Back to the Table of Contents
by Razor Cat 
A little idiocy is great for confidence. The game: Crash and Burn. The object of this game is to crash and burn. Hit women with 
the worst lines, the most outrageous innuendoes, lame pickups, and so forth. Go down in flames repeatedly. Have fun doing this. 
Make this your goal. Okay, now you've been shot down in the most horrendous of ways. Fun, wasn't it? And you are still alive! 
And a whole lot more desensitised. Yes, this does work. I had six women laughing for an hour this way at a party. It's based on the 
Juggling school of management. In brief: they teach you to juggle in order to be a better manager. The first thing that they have 
you do is drop the balls. You spend five or ten minutes practising this. The lesson is that you can't be afraid of dropping the balls. 
Screwing up isn't' failure, it's just screwing up.

Ross comments on www.introme.com
Back to the Table of Contents
Ross Jeffries has set up a website, the sole purpose is which is getting him more girls. The site contains only one page of text, but 
as that text is supposed to get any female that happes to read it irresistably curious and intrigued about the author of that text (who 
happens to be Ross:), intrigued to the point of contacting him in hopes of being able to offer him some company, then it is safe to 
assume, that Ross has done his best to make that text as effective as possible. 
You can either go check out the site - www.introme.com - or read the text here with commentaries from Ross: 
Did you ever instantly know you were going to like and trust someone for a long, long time? 
(A simple use of languaging to get them to recall feeling a state of trust so that everything else that follows is accepted and 
acceptable) 
Maybe you only knew them for a short while but it seemed that you had known them your whole life, as if there were a timeless 
connection between you. 
(A more detailed description to deepen the experience) 
As you read these words and remember those amazing feelings, 
(Linking ongoing behavior to the feelings I wish them to have) 
it's good to know that sometimes life has a way of making us remember those things, right prior to discovering that we can 
experience those feelings again... 
(The fact that she IS remembering these things is PROOF that she is about to experience it again. She isn't experiencing them 
because she's reading the languaging... but because she's about to experience it again! It isn't a production... it is an OMEN! A 
PROOF!) 
With me... in my experience, it's the kind of thing that can't be forced and no essay or words can create it. 
(Therefore her feeling it is NOT because of the fact she's reading something LOADED with languaging! It MUST be natural..and 
therefore, not to be resisted!) 
Words and appearances are only expressions, the vehicles that contain the essence that moves us. It can only happen naturally as 
the expression of an energy between two people, 
(Again, it isn't a MANIPULATION but a DISCOVERY!) 
but when it does...it's just like that feeling of incredible bonding, when all the barriers melt and drop way, and two people come 
together, fused into one spiritual essence, 
(more detailed description to deepen the state and the ambiguity of "come together" begins the process of sexualizing it)

the mingling of energies feeding one to the other, building and increasing and intensifying, mingling into an expression of 
aliveness that words can initiate but never capture fully. 
(Hmmm... if WORDS can't fully capture it, then the only way for her to get ALL the goodies... the ENTIRE cookie... is to MAKE 
IT REAL WITH ACTIONS!) 
It has instead to be indulged inside your own imagination...dwelled on, contemplated, experienced, deep, deep inside you. 
( I want her looping on it....not just reading once and forgetting it...) 
I do not know if you are the kind of person 
(A challenge..is SHE sharp enough...DEEP enough...GOOD enough?) 
that can imagine enjoying that that kind connection, with someone wonderful who deeply moves you. 
(commanding her to imagine it)(and note the ambiguity of "someone wonderful"..WHICH someone?) 
But if you could envision the possibility and feel it opening now before you, drawing you irresistibly forward, how powerfully 
could you feel that urge to read on and learn more? 
(linking the feelings to the behavior I want, which is KEEP READING) 
If these words have moved you... 
Then perhaps you are the special, imaginative, fun-loving woman for me and perhaps we are already on the way 
(PERHAPS...in other words, ***I**** am not sure about ***YOU****...***YOU**** must prove yourself to ***ME****) 
to being able to meet and feel a special connection; a connection based not just on getting what you want, but moving beyond 
what you want into what could deeply fulfill you. 
(AHH... this is good: the CONTRAST principle. Introducing the idea that what she WANTS isn't really what has deeply fulfilled 
her and INSTEAD... she must seek something else! Appeals to the unmet need in virtually EVERY woman! And it is vague 
enough that SHE will fill in the blanks and ascribe the answer to that need or needs as being... ME... and therefore guess who gets 
to DEFINE THAT FOR HER? ME!) 
Me... I am open to that special, adventurous, athletic, in-shape woman who can show me she has a sense of purpose to her life and 
a sense of humor and play to her soul. 
(Who can show me... again, SHE must meet MY challenge!) 
A woman, not a girl, 
(Hmmm... ANOTHER challenge: are you a girl or are you a WOMAN who can decide for herself what is attractive? Or must you 
pick someone the other "girls" would approve of?) 
who is open to new learning,indeed even thirsts for it, but also has her own mind. A woman who longs to share with someone 
special; someone who will be her friend and lover, partner and adventurer, who will make each day together seem like the first 
and each moment together filled with that sense of a timeless and indescribable connection. 
(deepening and returning to what she will experience with me by further description) 
Do You Remember?? 
Do you remember when you were a little child and you went to bed expecting tomorrow to be a rainy stormy day?

(I'm aiming at doing a few things here with this and the next few lines of languaging: I want to by-pass the cynical adult who may 
be reading this and age-regress her to the little girl who can believe in "true love". And I'm going to use a universal experience to 
do so.....) 
But you woke up the next morning and to your delight and surprise, you looked out to see a brightly shining sun, and not a cloud 
in the sky? And you realized, "Hey...this day is MINE to make happen?" 
(Here I help her to recapture that feeling that anything can be hers... to give back the sense of possibility... NOTE: women eat this 
example up in person as well... use it and see for yourself!... they will often COMPLETE the story for you!) 
Imagine sharing those feelings every day with someone who truly understands, along with the passions only adults can create and 
share. 
(Two things: Now that she has the feeling, I get her to future pace enjoying it for a long, but unspecified time (every day) and also 
I am introducing combining this child-like sense of wonder with ADULT passions... creating a NEW possibility! Thus I 
demonstrate I CAN create new feeling states in her... the very thing I am claiming I CAN do... so now she has an experience of 
the claim being true!) 
More About Me... 
I'm 6 foot 2, athletic/slender, dark hair, dark eyes and I am very pre-occupied with stimulating and intelligent conversation 
(Another challenge: do you have a brain with the body and face, honey, or are you just a dumb bimbo!) 
while I love travel I believe the greatest adventure is to explore one's passions. 
(Ah..contrasting exterior travel with the INWARD journey!) 
I define true passion as not just lust in the moment 
(She's certainly ALREADY had that before with OTHER guys... so she's following along...) 
...it's not even when you are touched so deeply that you find you give all that you have. 
(Wow..really? It's rare for her to even have THAT, but what this guy is offering is even MORE? I GOTTA KEEP READING!) 
It's when you are touched so deeply you find things coming forth from you that you never even knew or imagined could be there. 
(Whoa! You mean love with this guy will TRANSFORM me into someone new and different? Let me feel things I NEVER could 
with anyone else? WOW! He's rare and special!) 
Can you feel that.....would be an amazing thing to experience with someone? 
(Telling her to feel it) 
ME: I'm not a doctor or an attorney but quite a successful self-made entrepreneur involved in the human potential movement, so 
you'll learn lots from me about spirit and mind as well as body! I must be with someone adventurous who LOVES to learn new 
things and is longing for an amazing new direction. 
(Some fluff and descriptions of me... then I put in the demand that she be willing to learn new things, which is TRUE and also yet 
another challenge. And then the ambiguity about AN AMAZING NEW DIRECTION (NUDE ERECTION) 
[One shouldn't mention not being an attorney or a doctor though. Why create a potential opening for a feeling of disappointment 
when there's no need to deviate from the path of keeping things constantly upbeat and positive - "ME: I'm a successful self-make 
enterpreneur..." etc. And the weasel phrases (new direction -> nude erection) - they have almost zero chance of being effective 
when read. Seeing the words "new direction" will literally make an image of a new direction in your mind (you might imagine a 
sign, or a road, or someone pointing in a new direction with his/her hand etc.) while the possible phonetic ambiguity has no

chance to interfere anywhere during that process - tony] 
Someone who can decide on her own what SHE uniquely finds desirable, magnetizing and attractive based on her own deep 
feelings and needs. 
(Translation: if she DOESN'T find me attractive, it is because she can't think for herself! ANOTHER CHALLENGE!) 
Not because society would approve. Not because her friends would validate it. Not even because it is what she is used to or 
expecting or based on seeing her "type" or what is "typical", because maybe what is typical hasn't really made you very happy in 
the past. 
(A truism AND a play on words between "type" and "typical" that will UTTERLY destroy the "not my type" objection!) 
But because she is ready... truly ready... for something beyond what she really even thought could be possible. Because maybe 
feeling that amazing opening is the link between the girl inside the woman, and the woman inside the girl. 
(A way of making her even more open to suggestion: if it is beyond what she really even ****thought**** could be possible, 
SHE cannot define it, and must accept things as ***I*** structure and define them. Accepting this creates a "blank slate" of 
suggestibility. Then the ambiguity about an "amazing opening"... do I mean "opening" as in Vagina or the act of opening 
inwardly... plus the languaging of linking the girl and the woman recaptiulates the freedom of the child with the power of the 
adult... reinforcing the previous state I evoked!) 
What I Like... 
I'm strongly into touching, and intense kissing (electricity)... that first, soft brush of the lips so soft you're not even sure you're 
kissing yet, and it's as if all the passion..all the fire that will be experienced in the relationship is enfolded in that one, first, soft, 
special kiss, just waiting to be explored and made real. 
(Here I am eroticizing things but in an acceptable, poetic way by dwelling on that first, amazing kiss... getting them to have some 
nice body feelings too! Somaticizing it to make it more, even MORE vivid and REAL!) 
It's that moment where time stands still and yet in that one moment, there is an eternity of experience to be explored. It makes 
your knees weak and your heart soar and every part of you comes...alive...awakened...ready for whatever will come next. 
(Deepening the state by more describing!) 
More For You... 
I am willing and able to learn from you just as I am willing and able to teach you many new things. Moving forward together in 
life, longing for this amazing new direction. Feeling totally excited with permission to not only be who you are, but to totally 
explore and accept the person who is even NOW emerging. 
(AHHHH... there's the rub... creating TWO of her... the OLD her with her "fixed" ideas of what is attractive, acceptable, 
desirable... tasty... and the NEW her... who she will discover through accepting MY suggestions, feeling totally alive with the 
PERMISSIONS ***I*** GRANT HER!) 
So if perhaps you are this woman, 21-39, with a touch of poetry in her soul (and a bit of a naughty mind), then maybe you can feel 
surprised at how much you'd like to meet and learn more. 
(Then again, she may not be surprised at ALL at how much she wants to meet and learn more!) 
Please understand that looks are not enough; I truly seek a person with a good, strong philosophy of life, a high-self esteem, a 
sense of fun and adventure, a love of life and learning and a great imagination (so very important!). 
(All 100% totally true requirements of mine and also MORE tests for HER to pass! If she responds at all, SHE'S ACCEPTED 
**MY** FRAME THAT I HAVE SET THAT ***I*** am the prize and SHE must work for ME!)

Please also have a good sense of humor and play, and a love of all things sensual (if your skill with your lips matches your luck 
with your looks then maybe we already have something amazing in common!) 
(A bit of boasting here by asking if SHE can give as good oral as I can...) 
Does This Sound Too Good To Be True? 
Sometimes in life, we get hurt and let our disappointments or past experiences block us from holding out hope...hope that real 
love with real people can be possible. 
(Ok...right about now, I want to destroy/innoculate against the "This is too good to be true objection"... so I VERBALLY PACE 
IT FIRST... this is usually a great match for what she is thinking and so it ADDS to the power of what I have been doing! Wow! 
HE UNDERSTANDS! VERBALLY PACE HER ONGOING REALITY, BOTH EXTERNAL AN INTERNAL AND YOU CAN 
POWERFULLY INNOCULATE AGAINST ANY POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS AND INSTEAD USE THEM TO 
OVERWHELMINGLY INCREASE RAPPORT!!!! THIS PRINCIPLE WILL MAKE YOU A REAL "PUA" INSTEAD OF 
YOU WANNA-BE GINZA BABIES!) 
But behind all that...behind all the cynicism and hurt...the let-downs and the "not quites" is the part and the person who believes. 
(Ahhh...the fact that part of her may not believe is only PROOF that there IS a deeper and MUCH more willing part! The doubt 
you WERE feeling is the VERY reason AND signal to go inside and BELIEVE TOTALLY!) 
The one who believes in love and being loved for who you are. As you listen to the message that one is telling you right here, 
right now...NOW what do you feel just might be possible, if you reach out and make this yours? 
(Create or re-energize that part and she will, from this alone, feel so wonderful, alive and NEW that she'll want to jump ya out of 
sheer gratitude and how great she feels... note also the command into ACTION... dont' just feel it, but "reach out and make this 
yours... by following the instructions in the next paragraph! So I give the command and then the specifics of WHAT TO DO!) 
Here Is Your Next Step To Take... 
Got pics? Well...you show me yours, I'll show you mine". No pics? Then don't ask! I don't mind younger women (21+) and have 
dated/enjoyed a few, but you younger gals, don't write me if you can't sustain the excitement; thrilled to be your teacher but not 
looking to be a babysitter! 
(I'm DESTROYING the age objection by telling the youngsters, "HEY..DON'T WASTE **MY*** time "girls" unless you can be 
a WOMAN with me!) 
[But he is also destroying the illusion he has created by shifting from romantic and poetic "feelings" language he has been using 
so far to arrogant and slang-style talk here - "got pics? show me yours, I'll show you mine. you younger gals" etc. Of course he 
has to filter out the willing but immature, but the way he goes about doing it might also scare away some of the willing and 
mature - tony] 
So my preference is 27-39, please! (If you're hot and flowing with life, a few years older won't matter either!) Piqued your 
interest? Good! How strong can you feel that building before you RESPOND AND EMAIL ME at paul@introme.com 
(Link the feeling TO THE ACTION! THEY MUST TAKE!) 
Of course, you don't have to email me right away; you might want to take a few minutes to feel the excitement and anticipation or 
even read this page over a few times before you email me. 
(A false choice...do what I want now or wait a few minutes and DO WHAT I WANT then!) 
Then you can look back on it and enjoy the satisfaction you feel as you look forward to receiving my reply! 
(Future pace them feeling great ALREADY HAVING ACTED!)

Female seducer turning straight girls into bi and lesbian
Back to the Table of Contents
From the archives at Maniac High's Seduction Website: http://metabork.fr.eu.org/~maniac 
MANIAC: Personal Profile: Attack of the Catwoman! 
Hi all, 
Today I am going throw into discussion, someone I know who is capable of what I consider, an ultimate seduction. A friend of 
one of my GF's is a (Japanese) lesbian sadist. Her (the "Catwoman") sport, is to meet normal girls, get them to fall completely in 
love with her, and make them lesbians (or Bi's) so that she can shag them or do whatever else she wants to do to them. I consider 
this to be the ultimate seduction, as not only does she have to catch the chick, she has to make them lez too. 
I am going to talk about her system here, as I think there are lots of applications that guys can use to get chicks with this as well. 
And since the system was designed by a chick (and a chick knows a chick's thinking better than a guy does probably), it does 
exploit a lot of things about chick logic even I have never thought of.. 
Allright, here we go.. 
The Catwoman is a 24 yr old very bright (though not so pretty) young lady. She is a psych. Major, and seems to understand 
psychology as well as chick logic thoroughly. My GF even admits that she feels very comfortable around her, even though she's 
never lez'd with her (she says ;-) ). Catwoman has a strong character, is a player and usually has several chicks on the go at once.. 
Her GF's are often very beautiful BTW.. 
So, what is Catwoman's system? Well, she plays a lot on the worries, and anxieties of chicks (and since she is a chick too, she 
knows what all these are), then applies stealth kino (see below for details), so integrates pleasurable feelings with intellectual 
security, and at that point can get an attachment with the chick. Then, grow the kino bit by bit, and she's got a friend to lez with.. 
Now, some things about her system, before I go into the details. First of all, she can't do this at SS speeds, mainly because of the 
lez' barrier (it is hard to get a chick to fall in love with a chick in 1 week if she was never interested (overtly) in chicks to start 
with). She says it takes about 1 month to 3 months (depending on the chick). 
So first she meets the chick. She doesn't say she is a lesbian, or her intentions with the chick. There is no sex talk at all, 
whatsoever.. At that point, she finds out all about them, and especially what their insecurities are (ie. Job, do they think they are 
pretty, worthwhile, smart, legs too fat, too thin..etc..etc, whatever). Cute girls always have tons of insecurities, so you just have to 
find out what they are. She approaches this, as she were an elder, or mother to the girls. At that point, she will often talk to them, 
and tell them she is worried/was worried about (whatever..job..etc), since last time they talked, which apparently grows their 
attachment. Also, she will tell them they are cute, not in a guy way, but as a confidence builder way (ie. You are cute, you are 
good enough.etc..etc), and how she will take care of them, protect them. This will go on for a while, playing on the insecurities 
of the chick. 
Then, the stealth Kino will start. Her gimmick is to start kidding with the chick that she is a cat or kitten (chicks just totally love 
cats). The first few times, she'll just talk how she is cute like a cat (note, that by comparing to a cat, there is nothing sexual in the

How to Lay Girls Guide
talk.it is cute in a chick's way, like pretty flowers, or whatever, so the chick doesn't get scared she's gonna get lez'd by the 
catwoman). 
Later, little bits of kino will start, pet her on the head, chin, and later take her hands or arms while talking about how she is cute 
like a cat, and how she is so cuddly, and then she'll hug her (chicks also love hugs), again, nothing sexual, no implication, but it 
is getting the chick to enjoy those nice feelings, and grow more attached as Catwoman plays the insecurities and acts as a mom 
and protector to the chick. 
My GF says that this feels very comfortable, and is not threatening whatsoever. My GF doesn't like other chicks to touch her, but 
with Catwoman, its okay, she isn't scared (my suspicion, is that Catwoman is also using NLP and anchors, since she is a chick, 
and a Psych. Major, so I am sure she is good at this too, which also dispelled the fear). 
Then, at some point, Catwoman will play the fears of the chick, and get her over to `console her' and protect her and make her 
feel at ease (job, too fat, too skinny, not pretty, whatever). And they will talk, and it will get late, and she'll offer that she can 
spend the night, so she doesn't have to go back home alone scared. Then the cat games will start, and the kino, and the chick will 
feel at ease.no sexual passes at this stage yet though. 
At this point, is usually, when the chick will tell Catwoman she feels really good around her, or loves her somehow or something 
like that. Then, and only then, Catwoman will make her move, again, gently, and with the cute cat thing, and get more physical, 
kiss her, or touch her body, or whatever Lez's do. 
Basically, Catwoman can get in because she acts as this woman's protector, and confident, and the person who `truly' 
worries/cares for understands that girl. 
Apparently this system works most of the time she says. 
I think its a good system, especially the cat/kino thing, and playing the "I was so worried about you/wondering how you are 
doing" cards with the chick's anxieties.Truly classic.

Rolling Stone article about Speed Seduction
Back to the Table of Contents
By Eric Hedegaad in the 3/5/98 Rolling Stone: 
…Meanwhile, a few blocks away, on University Avenue, a group of guys spread themselves out and slipped into coffee bars, 
restaurants, bookstores, furniture shops and fancy fragrance emporiums. They called one another "brother" and went by names 
like Brother Kamal, Brother ESR, Brother Orion, Brother Vijay and Brother 007. They were laughing, whispering and taking 
long, appraising looks at all the pretty young Stanford girls. Around midnight, Brother Orion caught up with a summer-blond 
coed named Tara*. Only once before had a man stopped her like this. It made her a bit uncomfortable, but Orion, who was in his 
mid-twenties and wonderfully pleasant, seemed so sincere, and just the way his bright blue eyes gazed into her own eyes - before 
she knew it, she was listening quite intently to everything he had to say. Speaking softly, with many long pauses between his 
words, Orion got her to see a rose in her mind, then to rub the imaginary petals, so soft, against her cheek. Tara smiled, dreamily. 
"That's right," Orion said. "And now, notice what it's like as that flower turns into your favorite-flavor lollipop from when you 
were a little girl." A look of bliss came to Tara's face. She seemed full of remembrance. "Now," Orion said, "pop it in your 
mouth and taste." Tara's eyes widened, her lips parted and in slid the imaginary lollipop. Orion did not stop there. He started 
whispering to her about how interesting he found it, the way that people connect with their daydreams and fantasies "in those 
special places," he murmured. And after a while, a curious thing happened: Tara's cheeks flushed and her entire body shivered, as 
if she'd just been touched, with velvet hands, in that most special of special places. 
It was all quite amazing, and before Orion hooked up with Ross Jeffries and became his student, none of it would have been 
possible, just as anything similar would have been impossible for all the other brothers there that night. Jeffries had changed 
them. He had changed their lives. He had taught them the secrets of Speed Seduction. WHAT A REGULAR GUY WANTS 
more than anything, always has, always will, is to land some nooky far beyond his reach. He has neither looks nor power nor 
money nor fancy car, none of that good babe- getting shit, and yet he dreams the ancient dream: to be able to dump Harriet in 
favor of Cindy and thus, for the benefit of all generations to come, divert the usual flow and direction of his genetic puddle. This 
would be a wonderful thing, he feels. And even then, thinking of it, a whole range of possible ancillary benefits springs to mind: 
He'd be less shy; his complexion would clear up; his career would take off. In all ways, he would be better. And yet how is this 
ever to come true? Is there not someone who can make it so? 
In modern times, the first theorist to tackle the problem was one Eric Weber, who in 1970, as a very shy, very horny young man, 
bought a $13 tape recorder and walked around Manhattan asking girls questions like, What would a guy like him have to do to 
pick up a girl like her? He self-published his findings in a book titled How to Pick Up Girls!, placed a few ads in Penthouse and 
went on to sell well more than1million copies of the thing. In the main, however, the advice was less than life-changing: "The 
first and really the only thing it takes to pick up girls is to talk to them.... That's all there is to it. If you can do that, you can really 
pick up girls. By the truckloads!" 
Nonetheless, for the next two decades, Weber seemed to have a lock on the market. You wanted a couple of salutary tips on 
meeting women, his book was about it. Only a few years ago, however, some other titles began to show up - not in bookstores, 
mostly, but via the Internet or by mail order. There was How to Pick Up Beautiful Women, by John Eagan; How to Be the Jerk 
Women Love, by FJ. Shark; A Bartender's Guide on How to Pick Up Women, by Bryan Redfield; How to Date Young Women, 
by R. Don Steele; plus a few others. For the most part, they took the old Weber notions and simply stretched them in a few new 
directions; the methodologies took no real quantum leaps.

Rolling Stone article about Speed Seduction
But then a book arrived that was far, far different. It was titled How to Get the Women You Desire Into Bed: A Down and Dirty 
Guide to Dating and Seduction for the Man Who's Fed Up With Being Mr. Nice Guy, by Ross Jeffries . It came with its own 
front-page disclaimer: "The reader is warned that the use of some or all of the techniques in this book may result in legal 
consequences, civil and/or criminal. Use of this book is done at your own risk." 
…He truly believed in what he was teaching, because it was based primarily on what had so thoroughly changed his own life just 
a few years earlier: neurolinguistic programming (NLP). An entirely wigged-out approach to psychology and communication 
that had been around since the mid- 1970s, NLP brought about change through the use of trance states, hypnotic language 
patterns, embedded commands and lots of other weird shit - and it promised these changes in half-hours or hours, not months or 
years. Of course, the psychiatric establishment dismissed it as New Age nonsense and hocus-pocus, yet what was psychiatry but 
a bunch of money-grubbing assholes who thought nothing good could come from anything less than, say, seven years of therapy 
and by that very belief sealed any poor sap of a patient's fate for the better part of a decade? NLP, on the other hand, cut to the 
chase and got on with it. In many ways, it was at the heart of the entire human-potential movement. For example, personal-
growth giant Tony Robbins used it all the time in his training especially when it came time to get his seminar goers to walk on 
hot coals. And now there was Ross Jeffries saying stuff like, "If you want to walk on coals, go see Tony, but if you want to get 
laid, come see me!" and, quoting Voltaire, "Give me ten minutes to talk away my ugly face and I will bed the Queen of France!" 
It was a powerful message, made all the more powerful because it seemed so honest of Jeffries to admit that learning Speed 
Seduction took both intelligence and practice, and that even then it wouldn't work in all cases. "It works about seventy percent of 
the time - and the rest of the time, nothing else is going to work, either," he liked to say. "At least with SS you find out in less 
than ten minutes instead of ten dates, ten weeks or %Io,ooo in the hole." This was awfully appealing, and his teachings were 
eventually taken up by about qo,ooo students from around the world. Some of them were weenie-loser-geeks, some simple 
horndogs and some ju st hopeful seekers of an edge up on the next Joe. They came from all kinds of backgrounds (though 
computer nuts seemed to predominate), and almost all of them referred to Jeffries as their most beloved Guru of Gunch. No one 
thought there could be a downside to learning what he taught, no dreadful, soul-sucking consequences such as one might get in a 
Faustian-bargain-type scenario. And so they swore their loyalty to Jeffries, and he, in return, promised to give them something 
they had never had before. 
"I can teach how to give men a massive and quick way to decide on a woman's potential and to create an attraction. This is not 
about dating. Speed Seduction is meant to replace dating. Dating is for women you're already sleeping with." When Jeffries got 
to talking like this, he could not stop. His mouth ran over with how revolutionary SS was, how it was absolutely real and not 
some sham, and how truly magical and life-changing a teacher he was. His ego ran wild. He dropped names shamelessly among 
his Speed Seduction converts were, he said, Richard Brodie, the bestselling author of Virus of the Mind and the original author 
of Microsoft Word, and Lewis De Payne, the infamous hacker and a pal of convicted felon Kevin Mitnick's, better known as the 
Dark Side Hacker. Then, to distance himself from all this direct self- promotional blather, he would quote other people talking 
about how great SS was, as in, "Lewis De Payne once said, `You know what you're doing with SS? You're doing the ultimate 
hack. You're creating super user privileges on someone's core account and allowing yourself to create a password that you 
wouldn't normally have.' And he's right!" 
At the same time, though, Jeffries didn't claim all credit for the development of SS. He talked incessantly about SS as an open- 
architecture kind of thing, constantly being improved upon by the brothers in the field. 
JOHN GRINDER, THEN A LINguistics professor, and Richard Bandler, then a student of theoretical psychology, first began 
working on what would become NLP in the early seventies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The course that Grinder 
taught, with Bandler's help, was known to various UCSC students as Mind-Fucking los. The two professors theorized that any 
subjective human experience - all the terrible shit that happens in life can be quickly and easily transformed in the unconscious 
mind through the subtle and cunning use of language, with the listenerpatient settling into a very light, conversationally induced 
hypnotic trance. This radical notion stood conventional therapy on its head - it said you didn't have to work through past traumas 
to get healed - and formed the basis of the therapeutic model of NLP. But Bandler and Grinder soon realized that the same 
concept could be used just as effectively in persuasion, by anybody who wanted to persuade anybody of just about anything. 
Shortly thereafter, Science Digest wrote that NLP was potentially "the most important synthesis of knowledge about human 
communications to emerge since the explosion of humanistic psychology in the sixties." Naturally, therapists and used-car 
salesmen around the country were in awe.

Rolling Stone article about Speed Seduction
For Jeffries, Speed Seduction as a practical application of NLP was about building altered states of consciousness in both the 
seducer and the seducee. For the guy, using various kinds of affirmations, the idea was to install in himself all manner of 
ferocity, playfulness, clarity, outrageousness and cockiness, no matter what kind of weenie-loser-geek, horndog or edge seeker 
he may have been before. Thus supercharged and in control, the guy then engaged himself in a singular mission: to capture and 
lead the imagination of the HB of his choice. He might start by saying to the woman, "I have an intuition about you," which 
would perk up her ears - after all, he was talking about her favorite person, herself - and lead her from a state of presumed 
neutrality (the guy was probably not the best-looking guy in the coffee shop) to definite interest and intrigue. He might then offer 
to analyze her handwriting. O r he might tell her that she was a very visual person and proceed to conjure up images in her mind - 
deeply sensual images - by telling her metaphoric stories, stories that SSers called patterns. Full of sensory-rich descriptions, 
these patterns were cone structed mostly of so-called process language - vague, nonspecific wordings that allowed the HB's 
imagination to roam and that led the HB into a dreamy kind of trance state. They were also full of sexual suggestion, with the 
typical pattern making liberal use of words like open, penetrate, come inside, surrender, below me (pronounced blow me) and 
your mind (pronounced you're mine). Each of the patterns had a name among others, there was the Discovery Channel pattern, 
the Incredible Connection pattern, the Peak Experience pattern and the much-loved, often-used Blow Job pattern, which luridly 
described eating a piece of chocolate and ended with the suggestion that "It's like an explosion of pleasure in your mouth" - and 
could be run verbatim, although the ultimate goal, for advanced SS students only, was to be able to make up patterns on the spot. 
The terrible thing for Jeffries was that any time he told people in the media about this process - Jerry Springer, say, or Sally Jessy 
Raphael - they basically just laughed in his face, like it was some kind of Saturday Night Live joke or a con, and in either case a 
disgusting, outrageous affront to women. On the other hand, the great thing was that in the field, at a coffee shop or a quiet bar, 
with time enough to play out the entire SS methodology, with its set of language progressions, the stuff really seemed to work. 
Now, at the Broadway Bar and Grill, on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Jeffries was himself entering into an 
altered state. He had his own way of getting there, by humming the Rocky and Bullwinkle theme song, saying to himself, 
"Yummmm," and then, out loud, saying, "Let's go have some fun!" 
He glanced down the bar at a blonde who looked like Sharon Stone, only sweet. In an instant, Jeffries was by her side. Her name 
was Lacey. That very evening she had broken up with her boyfriend. She said she thought she knew Jeffries. Jeffries smiled and 
said he thought he knew her, too. He paused, frowned, modulated his voice and in almost a whisper, he began running a pattern 
on her. He said, "You know, I was watching the most interesting show on the Discovery Channel last night. They were 
interviewing people who make their living designing attractions for amusement parks. And they were talking about the elements 
that make up the . . . ideal attraction. They said there are three parts to the . . . ideal attraction {pointing to himself}. First, when 
you experience the . . . ideal attraction, you feel a state of high arousal. The . . . ideal attraction . . . makes your heart beat faster, 
and your breathing gets faster, and you just feel that amazing rush all over. And then another part of the ideal attraction is, it's 
fascinating. You just feel so enthralled that you want to . . . take this ride multiple times; as soon as you . . . get off .. . you want 
to get back on again." He continued in this way for quite a while, during which Lacey's eyes did not waver; they were fixed to 
his. "And as I was watching, I thought to myself, `Isn't that the perfect description of the ideal connection between two people 
and how you feel when you've met someone you really like? I mean, I think when you . . . make that kind of connection with me 
. . . you just . . feel that rush of . . . excitement . . . and you just want to be with that person a lot." 
At this point, Lacey wore the expression that Jeffries often referred to as the doggy-dinner-bowl look. It was unmistakably 
wanton. She reached over, put her hand on his and said, "It's like sex, isn't it? Or that first kiss." 
Later on, after it was all over, Jeffries said, "Oh, man, that was too much. I mean, isn't this like the most fun youcan have, man - 
fucking with people, playing with their minds?" 
…NLP. First he did therapeutic work, mostly curing guys of shyness and phobias. Then he got interested in the persuasion side 
of NLP and somewhere along the line got the bright idea to try the stuff out on girls. He couldn't believe the results. "I realized," 
he said, "that attraction, and love, is not a thing. It's a process that people undergo, and you can trigger the process."

Job Interview patterns - a different perspective on NLP and patterning
Back to the Table of Contents
At first glance, these patterns have very little to do with seduction, but as they use the same aspects of NLP and patterning to 
create states and elicit feelings used in seduction, they provides us with a useful perspective on the possibility of using NLP in 
almost any every-day situation. Plus you can use them to get that dream-job of yours:) 
The Cover Letter 
By ColdThreat. Mindlist: 
"Dear Employer, 
I am writing in response to your advertisement in New York Times about an entry level programmer position.  This advertisement 
must have generated an enormous number of responds.  It must be really tiring and boring to have to read other cover letters 
which are repetitions of the same message over and over and over again.  I understand why that is the way you feel sometimes, 
because in the past I had done the same.  But! 
Stop! for a second.  Have you ever read a resume or interviewed someone, and you know instantaneously that this is the ideal 
candidate to hire?  As you read this letter and as you imagine what it will be like to work with a person like me, may be you 
would list in your mind the qualities that constitutes a great employee.  What would it feel like to meet a person who satisfies all 
the top qualities that you sought for?  Me, I think it is a switch that clicks in your stomach, the same type of click that you feel 
before you make great decisions. 
As you read other cover letters and resumes through out the day, how surprised would you be to find a picture of me or this letter 
coming back into your mind?  And the more you read, the more you will naturally and easily convince yourself that you have 
already found the ideal person.  Now.  May be to the point where you can imagine a time in your future, say a couple of years 
from now, looking at this decision that you made and seeing how it had help you and your company, and you look back on this 
moment as having been the start of that great relationship.  Then, you can sigh that sigh of satisfaction. 
I do not know whether I will enjoy the challenges I will get working for you or just simply enjoy working with other great 
coworkers in your company.  Either way, it sure will be exciting for us to find out, won't it?" 
The Job Interview 
By Benjamin Strackany. Mindlist: 
""You know, one of the big things I know everyone's looking for is good rapport, and I'm looking for it too, because while 
someone might look good on paper, you WANT TO HIRE A PERSON* that can be a strong and contributing member of the 
team. I mean, how nice it is to be able to WORK WITH SOMEONE* that challenges you, is creative, fun, dependable, and 
enthusiastic? Have you ever known an employee or co-worker like that, and really felt good working with them? As you 
REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS LIKE, NOW, isn't it good to know how with some potential employees you just KNOW 
THAT YOU AND THAT PERSON* WOULD GET ALONG GREAT? I think when you FIND THAT SENSE OF RAPPORT 
AND TRUST...NOW, WITH ME, I think that's one of the most valuable things to find in a candidate, so that when you FEEL

How to Lay Girls Guide
THE BEGINNINGS OF A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE*, and HEAR HOW WHAT THEY SAY 
JUST MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE, you might even SAY TO YOURSELF, 'Now this is someone that I'd really like to 
work with,' isn't it?" 
Then if they are agreeing with you and seeming pleased, you could continue on with more, like this: 
"And what's really great is how, when you FIND THE RIGHT PERSON* for the job, it's like this window of opportunity to 
succeed in what you're looking for. I'm sure you've made at least a few great hires in the past, or at least imagined how satisfied 
you'd feel after finding the perfect candidate and bringing them onboard. And I'll bet that after the interview, you know, and when 
you THINK THE NEXT DAY ABOUT THIS CANDIDATE*, when you were DECIDING TO HIRE THIS PERSON*, how 
excited you were as you LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THIS PERSON IN THE COMPANY, and maybe said to yourself, 
'Wow, that's the person I need for this position.' But what's neat, and I don't know if many people realize this, is how after you 
HIRE THIS PERSON*, that feeling of satisfaction and rapport continues on, of course, and how sometimes six months down the 
road you can be looking back on the moment when you decide YOU WANT THIS PERSON* TO WORK FOR YOU, still glad 
that you finally found the kind of job candidate you needed. Being an interviewer like yourself, isn't that the kind of hiring that 
keeps you going? I know I stay driven by knowing that YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
RIGHT PERSON*, and with the whole team, ideally." 
(* - point to yourself) 
I didn't say it exactly like that, but you get the idea. I added the emphasis and pointing for extra use. I just kinda blurbed out a 
whole bunch for you, above, so feel free to use just pieces of it. Practice a bit to get the feel for the flow, and REALIZE HOW 
MANY OF THE PATTERNS AND TECHNIQUES HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE, JUST DIFFERENT TARGET 
EMOTIONS AND IMAGERY (heh heh, just playing with ya). This "pattern" basically gets them to (hopefully) remember 
someone they really enjoyed working with, and then associating those feelings with you. The generic technique of getting 
someone to remember something positive that you want them to feel about you, and then linking it to you, can be used in many 
situations. And hey, if they say, "Oh no, I've NEVER enjoyed working with anyone like that," well, do you really want to work 
for a company like that? I sure wouldn't... I'd be miserable. 
Notice how I used a number of things: time distortion, ambiguity (punctuation ambiguity? the "feel that...now, with me" thing), 
past experiences, verb tense shifts, command to think something the next day, different modes (FEEL, HEAR, and SEE), and 
generally a lot of embedded commands. Also, when you "point to yourself," do it very casually. I haven't seen anyone do it, but I 
just use a casual flip of the hand. 
Also, be sure to listen for words the interviewer leans on heavily. For example, in my field (computer programming/consulting) I 
hear people say the words "team," "object-oriented," and "excited" a lot. Makes me want to barf, sometimes, hearing those same 
words over and over and over....but anyhow, so I use those words when talking with people who could hire me. I'm sure your field 
probably has some human resources buzzwords that you can use, too. 
Hopefully this will help you out some. Also, Par Fornlands's comments on your attitude are very good, too. Those that look 
hungry never get fed, and those that are desperate never get laid (or get good jobs). Come across with a knowledge of your own 
worth. Be convinced that you are a good candidate and a good worker, and that you can do a good job for them if they give you a 
chance. If you honestly think you'll do a crappy job or that you're not really a good candidate for the position, though, then ask 
yourself why you're applying for jobs that are beyond your level. Good luck."

The rich and famous setup
Back to the Table of Contents
ASF: 
[…] I spot something across the room that is so 'delish'. I watch her for awhile and notice the grease studs striking out one after 
another. 
I get this silly idea in my head that has plagued me for awhile. I want to take it one step further. I find Adam who has his tongue 
in some strange girl's mouth. I tell him my idea and after some cajoling he agrees. What I wanted him to do was walk over and 
start talking to her but not hit on her. He wouldn't anyway after what I told him I had seen her do for the last half hour. 
He just started talking about her modelling career which she readily talked about and asked him about his as she had seen some of 
his stuff. Then he called me over and introduced me as his Hypnotist friend. I said "hi", was nice and left. After I walked away he 
put my plan into action. "Poor guy," he said and when she asked what my problem was he said "whatever you do if you find him 
even slightly attractive don't waste your time". She told him "no offence but he does nothing for me". "Good," he said, "because 
he gets hit on constantly by hot women and he is really getting tired of it. All they want is his money". "Oh," she said, "he's rich?" 
"Well off," said Adam, "and mildly famous". "Interesting" she said and then they continued their conversation. 
I came by her at least two hours later and asked if she had seen Adam. "No, but I am sure he will be back, why don't you talk to 
me until he gets here?" I of course stayed and talked cause thats what I wanted all along. We yakked for about fifteen minutes 
with her trying to be sneaky and get info on me as to who I was, what I did on the side, where I had been, do I travel often. I was 
infuriatingly ambiguous about everything as it's all lies anyway. Adam comes back inserts himself into the conversation and gives 
her a disaproving look which she returns with that "what?" look. I tell Adam that I am leaving because I am bored and to call me 
tomorrow. She say's that we were having such an interesting conversation and the night is young, stay stay. "No I am really bored, 
no offense". "Well here is my number, call me and we can continue this where there are no distractions". "Maybe" I say and take 
my leave with the number:)

I make eyecontact and waved her to come over (In my experience this never works except with girls with no self respect, so it's 
sort of test on my part) She gives me a look that says, "Yeah right". I get up and walk over to here (about 3 seconds since the

have an ear to ear grin). She says her friend got married. I keep asking her really bland questions about what she's doing, but with 
this huge smile (almost a caricature). After about 5 of these questions, "I say what do you do?" But then before she can say, I say 
"let me guess" (looking quizical for a few seconds). I say "your a lion tamer aren't you?" She imediately goes for it (every girl I've 
ever used this on has loved it and it's yours here royalty free :-) She still hasn't smiled during this whole time. I run with it. "Do 
you stick your head all the way in the lions mouth?" "That must be pretty risky." Still no smile at all but she is going allong with 
it. Then it happens. I feel here ankle brush against my leg. It's all over, smile or not. I put my hand on her knee. She smiles a few 
minutes later. We keep talking but with every sentence I move a little closer. Finally we are about 6 inches apart and I ask her 
question, and as soon she can answer I kiss her lightly. Then I ask another, longer kiss. Then I kiss here before she can answer a 
long real kiss. We take a break and her male friend comes back. I start talking to him imediately. Very friendly. After about 5 
minutes of conversationtion, she tells him she wants to leave with me. So we go for a walk... 
The moral of the story is: As mystery always says, the only way to defeat the bitch shield is with a smile (and lots of eye contact).

Svengali's street pick-up
Back to the Table of Contents
A classic street pick-up by Svengali using humour, romance, sex-talk and kino with confidence. 
Svengali, ASF: 
"Her: "Do you mind if I smoke?" 
And I said: "Why should you be any different from all the other women I have sex with?" 
Met her at the bakery counter. 
I said she had wonderful cup cakes. 
She gave an evil wonderful smile. 
Asked her if she liked ice cream. 
Naturally she says yes. 
I said "On what part of your body do you like it best?" 
She laughs. 
I say: "Am I funny enough to share a cup of coffee with during your lunch break?" 
(Pause, hesitation). 
"If you feel threatened being with such an old guy, you can bring your bear claws (I point to them in the counter)." 
She laughs. 
"Yeah, a cup of coffee will be fine." 
"Where do you usually have lunch and when do you usually have it?" 
{If I hear another McDonald's, I think I'll go nuts!} 
I knew she was mine after that. 
Humor, romance, humor, romance, sex talk, romance, humor, kino, sex talk, humor, sex talk, kino, kino, kino, kino... 
In my car. 
0 to sex in 72 minutes. 
(Of course I timed it! I had another woman to go to... who I was late to see ; - } 
BTW, she was 18, 5'8-5'9", @135#, her bra said "c" (but I really think she was a "b"), she asked for my phone number -- and I 
still don't know her name! 
This stuff is way too easy... 
and a whole lot of fun! 
Just one 'ol geezer's report. 
Two last things. I'm not prone to "kiss 'n tell" so you won't see hardly any of these reports coming from me. Also, and most 
importantly, I don't give a damn if you believe me or not.

Svengali's friend's street pick-up
Back to the Table of Contents
Another short yet entertaining field report by Svengali, this time the action is brought home by his friend:) Svengali, ASF: 
"Svengali's friend to a girl: "I love the way you spread your legs when you sit, only everything would look so much better to me if 
you were wearing a short dress and no panties" (he automatically and naturally laughs saying such "silly" things) 
FYI, the context of all this is that women, naturally, spread their legs open when they're wearing jeans or slacks. 
BTW, my friend and I both did her and it came out of this dialogue: 
Her: (with a smile on her face:) "How dare you. Don't you think that's a little indignant?" 
Friend: (with a smile on his face:) "You're getting mad at me because I find you attractive enough to want to have sex with you?! 
Look around here (coffee shop). How many women do you see?" 
Her: "About twelve." 
My friend: "See that woman over there [he points]? Her breasts are far better then yours. That woman over there has a much better 
face then yours; and that woman over there dresses better then every woman in this place, and that woman over there has you beat 
in the legs department. But I saw something you have that's better then every woman in here, and you should be flattered that I 
noticed it. But by covering it up, you're depriving everyone of all your glory. What do you think Svengali?" 
Svengali with a big amazed smile: "I think you're right." 
Needless to say, she was so blown away by what my friend said, that she did quite know how to respond. 
Long and short of it, we were both doing her in about an hour and half from the time we first met her. And come to think of it, we 
spent more time doing her then we spent getting to know her:)" 
[But then again, "doing her" is also one way of "getting to know her":)]

The original Mr Smooth posts
Back to the Table of Contents
Mr. Smooth, original posts (by Maniac High) 
Tonight, something very interesting happened, I ran into a guy using a new sarging approach, which I must say is different, but 
was very effective. The result, lots of HBs!! Shitloads of kissing (within 2 minutes of meeting the chicks!)! Phone Numbers, and 
babes from heaven. I am going to describe what this guy (and I with him as I picked it up from in during the night) was doing, and 
then would be very interested to get your opinions on how/why this was even working…I was shocked!! 
Tonight, I went with Taro to an area in Tokyo called Roppongi, a big nightclub and going out area (ever been to a place, where 
there are 15 story buildings, and each floor is a different club? Well that is Roppongi, apparently its got the biggest density of 
night life (1 square mile by 10 floor buildings all over) any where in the world. 
We arrived at midnight, and went to a dance bar. It was a rather uneventful evening until about 2am, trying to make eye contact, 
talking a bit to ladies, not much luck..loud music and very crowded place. 
Then all of the sudden, while I was near the dance floor, I got grabbed by a guy, to dance with this girl (he was behind her, I was 
in front), in that sandwich style. The guy I didn't know, but as I would find out later during the evening, he is one of the best and 
smoothest PUA's I have ever seen operate, and he had a very unusual style, which was extremely effective. "Smooth" is 26, 
average looking Japanese guy, wearing casual clothes, basically nothing that a girl would like on just looks alone. His secret, was 
what he said (and didn't say), and his very careful use of non verbal communications to slide girls downthe slippery slope of first 
repecting us, and then liking us. We were able to pick up HB chicks, get them to like us, and kissing us within 5 minutes flat. 
He came alone to bars, not with a wingman, and rather than go up to a girl, and introduce himself, like most guys do, but rather, 
gain rapport through introducing me (and not himself) to the girls. I would do likewise (you ever hear the story about the two 
russian admirals who started out as soldiers, and always complimented the other in their absense to superiors till they both got to 
be admirals..well this is what he was doing, with anchors, touching, visualization, jealousy..etc).; 
He would go up to a group of girls (and he wouldn't wait for eye contact or anything, he'd just go up), and introduce me (or which 
ever guy he could find around him), to the target chicks, lightly put his arms around both chicks (not in a imtimidating way, but a 
friendly way and say how such a great guy I was to the girls. He would basically get rapport with the girls saying how great I was 
(he didn't even know me actually), and not paying attention to any particular girl. He'd say how we should all be friends and get to 
know each other more, because (he said), I really like Japanese girls, and I thought they were so cute (and we only hit on 9s and 
10s, so they were all cute). I was just watching this, and didn't say much myself, but over the evening with different chicks, I 
started to do the same thing with the girls regarding him (how he is so great guy, we've known each other a lot… as a rapport 
mechanism). He was very casual, cool, and ironically, made poor eye contact with everyone, but talked authoritativly as well as 
relaxed. He'd never argue with a girl, but just usually repeat something about how nice it was to be friends, or how great I was, or 
how it would be fun to go eat or something, each time we got resistance. 
He'd then describe states to the girls, but using me in the context, ie. Hed say that I like her because her hair was so smooth and 
gentle..etc..etc, while he would touch her hair. He was also anchoring without knowning it, because everytime he'd say something 
to her about how I was a great guy, or how I thought she was cute (I don't speak much Japanese, so he could get away with this), 
he would tap her gently on the shoulder, or put his arm around her waist and bring her closer to me. Then he'd say more how I 
thought she was nice, and I was a great guy, and repeat again how we should get to know each other, he'd gently take both our

heads, and push them together for a kiss, in a joking way. The girl would usually refuse, and then he'd say how I really liked her, 
and gesture the cheek, and she;d kiss me there (or I'd kiss her there), then he'd get the other to reciprocate the kiss. After that, he 
talked about how that was really nice, and how it was good we were getting on so well, and how it would be good to get a real 
kiss. At the same time, he is already gently getting closer to the girl that HE wanted, his arm around her waist, while doing the 
whole kiss routine with me and the other girl. He is laughing, and so is the other chick(s). Then my chick and we would kiss (he 
would gently coax both our heads together), and at the same time, I have already got my arm around my chick now. We are being 
light and funny, being very overt about what we could get the girls to do, and doing a high 5 (me and Smooth) each time we made 
progress with a chick (kiss, cheek, arms..etc). Then we'd talk a little more to the chicks (nothing heavy topic, no overt NLP, no 
patterns, just touching lightly, but as the 20 minutes goes on, holding longer and longer to hands, neck..etc..etc). He now was 
doing the same thing with his chick. A couple minutes later he'd say again how we were getting on so well, and how the girl had 
made such a good choice to choose me because I was such a good guy, and that he wanted to see us (me and my chick) kiss again, 
since we were such a nice couple and relating so well. By that time, I had been holding her hand (this started when he told the girl 
I was really liking her because she was so nice and he took her hand and put it on mine). Then he took the hand of his chick, who 
was laughing and giggling through this. After we all got through our kisses with our respective chicks, we'd say how they are so 
fun and nice and we are so happy we met them and got to know them, and we'd say we'd love to get a chance to talk more, and get 
to know each other better. They'd ask how we could do that and I'd ask them (all of them), their phone numbers. I'd collect them, 
and kiss my girl again a nice long kiss, and then say we have to go, and we moved on to the next chicks in the bar (and we didn't 
take long, maybe 5-10 seconds), and jump in front of the next pair/threesome of chicks and do the entire routine over… 
So what did we get for the night. Well, I kissed more chicks that I can remember, got a shitload of numbers (15 or so?) of most of 
the HBs in the place, lots of touching, and they were all crazy about us at the end of the routine, which was around 20 minutes or 
so. Over the evening, as I learned his style, I would reciprocate, and we got better results even. 
This was working anywhere, we got a bunch of girls in bars, and two sets on the street near the clubs that we were able to start 
making out with right on the street within about 2 minutes of meeting them!! His opener for the kiss with one pair was really 
good. We walked right up to two HBs and he did his "my friend is a great guy routine and really likes you", like before, and then 
got her to agree that I was a nice guy too. Then he said that's great, so lets jan-ken (play rock scissors paper), and the loser (of me 
and the chick) has to kiss (ie. No matter who wins..the chick and I end up kissing..in reality), we played, she lost, and I gave her a 
short kiss on the lips right in the street 60 seconds after meeting her. Then he continued the above routine, in the prev. paragraph, 
and we ended up kissing more. I said that now we (me and my chick) kissed, so now I wanted to see him and his chick kiss..they 
did.. Again, the high fives each time we got a chick to do something, right in front of them..it was like a game show our attitudes 
with the chicks, and they got into it too. BTW, the chick I kissed in 60 seconds was only 19, I am 31, he's 26 and his chick was 19 
too. They were crazy about us too after about 10 minutes of this, we got their numbers, and then walked up the street 20 feet and 
did the same routine all over again with the next two HBs. 
Guys, I don't know why, but this works. If you get a good partner, you can really hit on a chick without hitting on her, if you are 
doing it for the other guy…because actually you arent really hitting on her!! (it helps if the other guy is reciprocating..or even if 
he's not, because you can do the moves on your chick, while describing how its nice for the other chick and the other guy to do the 
same thing, right in front of your own target). Like I said, he was just grabbing guys in the bar and introcuding them to chicks 
when there were groups..the other guys though didnt speak much japanese, so didnt get very far, but we did great and will go next 
week and get more chicks, once I finish with all the numbers I got. 
We did well, everyone was a 9 or 10, one chick wearing very sexy black hot pants and half top, and she was all over me like glue 
by the end. Severl others, I cant remember…I was necking with one for 5 minutes. We got all their numbers and they were 
pleading for us to call them by the end each time. Shitloads of women.. I'd never had a night like this before..this guy is GOOD!! 
Oh, that was the other thing, often, when we'd first introduce to a chick, they'd try to blow us out. But Smooth would never give 
up on chicks as long as there was interaction (even if it was negative) of any kind, for a minimum of 5 minutes. He'd repeat how 
great I was, and how much I liked them, and loved Japanese women… it worked because it is hard for the chick to blow him (me) 
out, since I wasn't doing anything,…he was talking about me.. in over 50% of the cases, after a bit of that, and how we should be 
friends, their barriers would go down, and we could start the normal routine, and get the french kisses and phone numbers and get 
them crazy about us, and move on. Again, very much 'game show host' attitude as he was moving me and the chick along, while 
doing the same thing to his chick. As well, he would talk with whoever in the bar, and make the chick wait a couple minutes (we 
were already holding their hands, so they had to wait…ie.. were were not supplicating..we made them wait, and get used to

waiting for us to finish). We did this in the street, he saw a street band, he stopped and started talking tot he musician, and just 
made the chicks wait (I am suprised they didnt leave..but they didnt) as they were a bit ahead of us on the street by then). 
Things he didn't do… didn't ask their names (until just before the phone close, but after the kiss), didnt talk about hobbies, or any 
of that other shit..just, I am great, their cute, we are wonderful, you should kiss, here take his hand, he is my best friend..etc..etc.. 
very surface level.. He was never serious, and never got into questions about jobs or whatever either, just he stuck to the point, 
were all here, lets have fun and and see what we can do. When a girl gave resistance, he never argued, but grab her hand, put it on 
mine, and say how we are having fun, ask her if she likes me (shed say I am okay), then go on to how I like her..blah blah. 
Aggressive somehow, but not really since he is not pushing HIMSELF on her, he is pushing me, and then taking his own chick 
along. He paid very little attention to his chick verbally, but would duplicate the physical stuff with the hands, et.al. that he was 
getting me to do with my chick. He would put his arms around all the chicks in the group with me, while we danced with 
them…again, game show host attitude all the way, high fives often when one of us would get a small 'win' with a chick..etc..etc. 
He'd say to come met us again next week (even though we got their numbers), and we'll be out here..blah blah.. When girls werwe 
on the street going someplace, or one chick in the group wanted to drag the others away, he'd ask where they were going, (they'd 
say, home..another club, drinking..etc), he'd say that's good lets go, and force us upon them. For about a couple minutes they were 
uncomfortable, but as he talked about how great I was, and happy we could spend time with them, and it was so much fun, their 
attitude would change..again, like when we'd first meet them kind of problem..he'd resolve it the same way..theyd start smiling, 
and we'd end up having lots of fun…the kissing..phon nums..touching..all over again. We had about a 75% hit rate (ie. We could 
french kiss and get numbers of about 75% of the chicks we hit on), using this method.. 
So what do you think guys? His approach worked because you can be very overt when you are "helping out your friend" (and of 
course the friend is reciprocating). We were with chicks all the time and both of us got much farther than we would have under 
any traditional approach. We decided to go to a chick shopping district and just try it on the street… That will be another report… 
One more thing…I have seen this approach in one other place, and I think this is where he learned it.. In Japan, there is a kind of 
erotic video, where two or three guys will just go on a street by a train station, and hit on girls exactly like he did (same phrases, 
actions..words), and try and get them to sleep with him to make the video. It is all real and unstaged.. Ironically, quite a few girls 
will actually go for it. He was doing exaclty this, like the appraoch the guys used in the videos to convince the girls (they are 
pretty, my buddy thinks you are sexy…blah blah..kiss game..blah). They are called 'street Nanpa' videos (nanpa = skirt chasing, or 
sarging), and are all over japan. They are very good instruction because they show all the pickups attempts successes and failures, 
of the chicks till they get the one that they sleep with.. probably someplace on the net has got them too,..they are all over Japan 
anyways… 
Mr Smooth no 2 
[…]
As soon as we got in, we started hitting within 10 secs (one thing about Mr. Smooth I like, is that he is not a wall flower, he will 
not spend more than 10 secs w/o talking to a chick...this is real important guys. hit..hit..hit). I hate wallflowers because they 
discourage me from hit hit hitting as they just stand around 'waiting for the perfect time',..fuck that..
[…]
Ok, I was the first one to go in, we are in the Pizza line, we meet at 9pm, and in the pizza place in a couple minutes, and I hit the 
chick in front of me in line, an 8. I introduce Smooth to her, following the routine we decided for the night. We got cold icy stares, 
but I kept on interacting though as long as she would, like I saw smooth do last time.. No luck, she started to ignore us and ran 
away.
[…]
RIght after that (20 seconds?) , I then tell smooth that I like the two chicks in the corner other side of the restaurant. I start looking 
over there, and I get eye contact with Black Dress HB, and her '7' friend. I gesture to come her, but she is reluctant, and keeps 
pointing to her friend. I gesture her do bring her friend over too. While they talk, Smooth gets 2 chairs ready at our table. They 
come over and we start talking..regular smooth routine, we get to kisses on the cheek in about 2 minutes. Not bad. 
[…]
Then Smooth tries his new approach, he wanted to know if within a couple minutes we could get chicks over to my house for a 
private party with all 5 of us. He makes the pitch, and then repeats it several times over the talk, they laugh and giggle. We then 
talk about playing a game popular in Japan called 'oosama' (the king). It is kind of a drinking simon says game, you pick a number

(or jan-ken rock scissors paper), and the winner gets to make two other players do something (anything). Apparently it is quite 
popular here, and after a bit of drinking, can get quite raunchy. I fake like I don't know what is oosama, and try to get the girls to 
explain it to me. Then I ask what is the most weird thing you did in oosama before (hoping to get something physical, which I can 
start to anchor on). I didn't get much results. We will use oosama in future routines, as it worked well, and you can get to 'physical' 
things in the discussion right away, which is good.
[…]
Lessons - going for getting a chick directly over w/o the setup first doesn't work (no biggie there, but we did want to try), and 
talking about 'oosama' is a good way to lead to other discussion along intimate / sexual lines. And getting phyical withchicks on 
the dance floor works well and is easy if you do it in fours or fives, before pairing off...cool!

NightShadow's IRC seduction

Back to the Table of Contents
Amongst others, the following topics are being discussed in the report and its commentaries: 
G     how to recover from forgetting that you were supposed to meet with a girl 
G     when and when not to pay for a girl's dinner/movie/transportation etc 
G     how to deal with seemingly unreasonable objections (to kissing for example)

good deal.  it is STILL her fault, but you don't mind it and let's move on to
the real stuff.  good move on the kino spot too.  tables impede your work...
also she WANTS to feel you on her, so if you can sit with her during dinner
instead of sitting across from her, she can get hot while you fluff.

I have to admit that digital-camera / laptop PC with pictures thing is really
great!  pictures are TRULY worth a thousand words.  I had a chick come over and
I left her a picture album while I went to another area.  I kept hearing WOW as
she was seeing me in places she has never been (like football stadiums and
skiing in vermont)  just seeing the pictures was like being there for her, PLUS
she saw me as ABOVE other guys she knows beacause I go places and do things.  I
am not limited to this city by any means.  I do what  I want to do when I want
to do it AND with several chicks that are MORE attractive than her and LESS
attractive than her.  more attractive = "don't think I need you" and less
attractive = "you have a chance to be with me... if you play your cards right!"

the fact that she OFFERED is much more important than making her pay.  the fact
that she was PREPARED to pay is more important here.  the same thing later when
she buys her own ticket.  she could have told you some bullshit about paying
for her to go home.  any chick worth ANYTHING is going to have enough money to
get herself into and out of situations.
you HAD to pay this time for several reasons.  you didn't want her to feel like
going out with you was going to cost her money every time.  she is ALREADY
PAYING TO SEE YOU by taking the train.  she is paying in money and TIME out of
her life.  2 hours each way?  show her a good time as a REWARD for the
sacrifices she is making to come see you.  make it worth her while.  she is a
student.  you remember being a student, right?  NO MONEY!  you don't want her
to think "I can't go out with him because I need to save up for..."  NOPE.  you
are not going to hook her with money anyway.  you can't... her parents pay for
everything including the roof over her head.  your money means SHIT!  plus she
is a GOOD student... she will be making her own money soon.  you can't treat
her like the HBs that have only looks going for them and NO EARNING POTENTIAL.
for me it depends.  I will feel out a student FIRST, then I will decide if I
want the burden of dating her.  if I don't, I keep it to things that are free
(rollerblading, going to the park...) or let her know that I'm not paying for
shit and if she doesn't like that, she can go.  otherwise, I will pay for
dinner or a movie or whatever... but NOT frivolous bullshit like "oh... buy me
that thing in the window" or "buy me flowers"  or ANY TYPE BULLSHIT LIKE THAT!
as long as it is an expense that involves us having fun and a great time
together, I will absorb it as long as I have decided that's the right thing for
me to do.  some chicks don't appreciate and it does you no good to pay for
shit.  recognize that and lay down the law.
I won't do that for nothing though.  you hook students with experiences and
good times... NOT money.  chicks that have jobs and income deserve NOTHING
because they are responsible for their own lives.  even if a student has a
part-time job, I know that she works MUCH HARDER for her money than I do.
paying for her to have dinner with me gives her a great feeling and it is a
gift from me to her, not a supplication... also, she will REMEMBER why she has
the money in her purse that she has there.  she gets to buy that new miniskirt
because YOU paid for her meal and entertainment for the night.  she will
remember you when she buys it and when she wears it.
feel free to pay for shit for students and poor chicks... just be sure to get
your money's worth out of it.  not in the fashion of "I paid so you have to
fuck now" but make sure that while you are paying money, you are demonstrating
so much value to her that you are in a position where she sees you as ABOVE
other guys... not for your ability to pay, but because you treated her like she
wanted to be treated and showed her a great evening.  you don't have to repeat
your performance EVER AGAIN!  just let her know that you CAN treat her like

never suspect SHIT!  analyze the situation.  what is different now from before?
 who came in? who sees her? what did you do? what did she do? how is she
feeling?  once you start suspecting shit (when the action is on) you travel
down roads of your own creation that have nothing to do with what is really
going on.  STAY IN THE GAME!

great.  change venues.  talking, holding and kissing TO dancing.  change the
atmosphere and attack from a new direction. the only thing you didn't change is
seclusion.  some chicks WILL NOT PERFORM IN PUBLIC!  get them in the park
bushes however... and it's ON!  you're still in public... but NO ONE CAN SEE
HER!

Tuesday.  DO NOT LET HER SEE YOU TUESDAY WITHOUT KNOWING IF SHE WANTS TO FUCK

what do you want her to do?  skip classes for YOU?  miss her education for YOU?
 that's why I stay away from chicks that have too much scheduled in their lives
like work and school and ESPECIALLY KIDS!  when I get into a new woman, I want
to see her every day for maybe a week, then cool out into a fucking-friendship.
 that see you next tuesday shit is fucked up :)  she is busy.  she has plans
for the future. you HAVE to accomodate her schedule OR go to her so she doesn't
have that time factor involved.  see that?  that's what I was saying about
paying for her.  you pay for her = she doesn't have to worry about making
enough money to date you before she comes out.  you going to see her = she
doesn't have to pick a day when she has 4 hours of train time to spare.  I am
not SUGGESTING that you go see her at all.  I am just saying that the distance
is a factor in her decision-making process.

stop fucking shooting in the dark!  unless you like it like that  :)  I
personally don't like dating at all.  I find prepared meetings to be boring and
contrived.  I like to meet women on the fly and make it happen wherever I am.
the thrill for me is in the hunt... not in everyday dating.  I LIKE shooting in
the dark  :)  I like not knowing what she's going to do and having to recover
and regroup.  the game is FUN for me.  having an ENTIRE WEEK to mentally sarge
a chick and throwing that away to GUESS "is she going to fuck next tuesday" is
DUMB to me.  I wouldn't do it.  what if you meet  a chick on monday that wants
to fuck on tuesday?  are you going to turn down a sure thing for a ???  NO
because you already did it.  you already blocked her out for a SURE THING.  so
find out if this chick wants to be your SURE THING.  that doesn't mean she is
going to give it up when she gets in your face, but at least she has SAID she
has plans to fuck!

you're probably right.  chicks PLAN to see guys on nights when they KNOW they
can stay over if they need to.  think about it.  if her parents think she
parties too much, that means she often STAYS OUT ALL NIGHT!

The Orgasmotron - planting a post-hypnotic suggestion
Back to the Table of Contents
Here's an interesting piece for your enjoyment - planting a post-hypnotic suggeston... to orgasm:) Well, sounds pretty 
unbelieveable, but then again, I've never tried it myself, so what do I know. Still, I would rather categorize this as "interesting" as 
opposed to "useful" for unless it is someone really-really special, I can't imagine taking the time to go through with the hassle of 
hypnotizing someone over the internet and even if I pull it off successfully, I can't help but wonder - now did I seduce her or 
what? What specifically does she feel for me now? Maybe all she wants from me from now on is for me to have her orgasm... 
over the internet:) And unless I get off from that specifically, I am left with pretty much nothing at all:) Then again, it states below 
that two additional non-relevant post-hypnotic suggestions have been removed - might they have been the "you feel incredibly 
attracted to me NOW" commands:)? Anyway, here's the experiment for you to believe or not:) 
By Alex Akselrod, Mindlist: 
"Well, OK, here's an edited log of tonight's Orgasmatron(TM) session. I took out 2 other posthypnotic suggestions I planted that

If she has second-thoughts - she wants it but can't quite make up her mind, "help" her:)
My home is my love-nest - make sure you can be confident about the quality of your retreat.
Networking and pivots - if you're not quite interested anymore or she's not quite interested yet.
Handling the girls:
Be busy - attract girls by being "busy".
Suggest competition - keep her on her toes.
Put a price on yourself - the more you "cost", the more value she attributes to you.
Show a willingness to walk away - don't let her take you for granted.
Use her friends - by realising, that "friendship" also means "rivalry".
Judge her by her actions, not by her words - or rather, let her actions speak the words.
Have and reveal secrets - provide a constant thrill for the woman.
Use poetry - women are about feelings; poems are about feelings - and mixing the two gets you dynamite:) 12 poems.
If she compliments you - make her feel good for having done that:)
Act like its special - and what you have can not be found anywhere else.
Paying her a compliment - an AFC trap, unless you do it right.
Cook for her and "date" at home - the main dish will be less expensive and the "dessert" more convenient:)
When should you call a woman after having sex with her? - don't blow it, she'll be very sensitive and tender about this one.
Romantic gifts and things to do - but use these to reward, not to bribe.

How to Lay Girls Guide
Managing many relationships at once - best policy is (tailored:) honesty.
Troubleshooting:
If she asks for YOUR number instead - don't fall for this (relates to Closing).
If she still refuses to give you her number - a strategy of covert persistence.
If she says "Why do you ask?" - read how to recover (relates to Patterning and Eliciting values).
If she asks "Are you trying to seduce me?" - this isn't trouble actually (she likes it:), but you still need to know how to answer.
"Have you ever...?" gets busted - what do you do, if she says "No" in response (relates to Patterning).
Ejecting - you don't always have to close. Know when to cut your losses.
If she cancels a date - she screwed you (and not the way you hoped she would:). Now what?
If she doesn't return your phone-calls/e-mails - a zero-tolerance policy.
If she shows disrespect for you - you dump her, aka The Returning Fox Theory.
The age difference problem - you shouldn't anticipate it, but its good to be prepared.
Nothing works with the girl - and you tried all your techniques. But there's an ace up your sleeve:)
If she says "Let's just be friends" - looks like you're in trouble, read how to recover.
Dealing with rejection - why you should never get rejected and how to cope with it, if you do.
But I really want this girl! - read why this is such a self-defeating attitude.

Micellaneous:

Bad jokes - careful:) "Pants in the air", "Telepathic watch", "Spermogram", "Doctor's appointment", "Voodoo dildo" etc.
A game of Crash and Burn - guess it depends on your definition of fun:) But a great experience (and confidence?:) builder.
