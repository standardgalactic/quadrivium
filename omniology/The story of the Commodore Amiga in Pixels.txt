it to my biggest customers such as 
Dixons, Comet, Currys, Laskys and the 
rest. It was very frustrating, particularly 
at computer shows and other similar 
events, which we attended regularly.
I remember vividly the occasion 
when we were showing off the A1000 
for the very first time at the Personal 
Computer World show, London's 
highest profile annual event, which was 
held in September at Olympia. We had 
a large screen on which we displayed 
thirty-two different windows and we 
had different programs running in each 
simultaneously! Admittedly there were 
some fairly modest programs among 
them, but it was nevertheless a truly jaw-
dropping demonstration, and it made us 
the star exhibit of the show.
I 
must say that I felt incredibly 
honoured when I was asked to write 
this foreword and also delighted, 
for two reasons. First, I am a huge fan of 
publisher Chris Wilkins' work. He has 
this amazing ability to capture the spirit 
of his books' subjects - be it software, 
developer or hardware - and presents the 
content in a way that all readers easily 
relate to, digest and thoroughly enjoy. 
This in itself is a profound and unique 
talent.
Second, of course not only is the 
Amiga a computer around which 
I centred an immense part of my 
career but the Commodore Amiga 
also changed so many people's lives 
considerably, all round the globe.
For me, when the first Amiga - the 
A1000 - was launched in 1985, it really 
was a bitter-sweet moment, and why 
was that? At the time my responsibility 
within Commodore Business Machines 
UK Ltd was National Sales Manager of 
the consumer products division so when 
Commodore positioned the Amiga 1000 
as a business and productivity machine it 
meant it was not within my portfolio.
Grrrrrr...
Can you imagine how that felt? To 
have a computer with revolutionary 
capabilities within touching reach but 
unable to market it, sell it, or even show

Well, one day my wish was granted 
in the form of the Amiga 500. At last a 
computer with all the same incredible 
features (in fact more) than its big 
brother but at a price we could offer to 
the mass market.
Many things came into play over the 
next period, including the launch of the 
Batman Pack in association with Ocean, 
which elevated the A500's profile. The 
resulting sales grew to an incredible 
level and we were able to maintain such 
substantial sales on a regular basis.
The next model to be released was 
the Amiga 2000, closely followed by 
the awesome A3000 and A3000T. 
(Eventually, I set myself up a 
professional music recording studio 
at the heart of which I had an A4000 
controlling all the equipment, a task it 
performed flawlessly.)
Within the consumer products 
division we launched a few models of 
Amiga, but the Amiga 1200 was by 
far and away the most popular and 
successful. It cemented our position as 
the number one home computer product 
of the 1990s.
So here we are so many years later 
and the Amiga has spawned a generation 
of computer savvy individuals, many of 
whom are now in high-profile positions 
in leading corporations around the 
globe. I am certain you will thoroughly 
appreciate The Story of the Commodore 
Amiga in Pixels and it will stir up lots of 
your warmest memories. Enjoy!

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Over thirty years later the computer and 
its custom hardware live on in emulation.
At the heart of the Amiga story is 
the man credited as 'the father of the 
Amiga', Jay Glen Miner (1931-1994). 
After a background in electronics with 
the US Coastguard and a decade in 
industry designing chips for calculators 
and computers, Miner joined Nolan 
Bushnell's fledgling Atari, Inc. in 1974. 
Once settled in - Jay regularly went to 
work with his dog Mitchy (she even 
had her own id badge) - he was tasked 
with developing a chipset for the new 
Atari Video Computer System or vcs, 
later known as the Atari 2600. A vital 
Miner-designed component of the 2600, 
the tia (Television Interface Adapter) 
was the machine's graphic hardware. As

lthough earlier computers existed in 
isolation from the world, requiring 
their visuals and sound to be
 generated and live only within 
their memory, the Amiga was of the world, 
able to interface with it in all its rich 
analog glory.
So wrote Jimmy Maher in The Future 
Was Here: The Commodore Amiga (MIT 
Press, 2012). But bringing that future to 
the then present, from idea to market, 
the story of the Amiga was a long and 
twisting road, intertwining two of the 
biggest computer companies of the 
1980s - Commodore and Atari.
It is the story of unique ideas, 
management failings and the rapid 
growth of both the gaming industry and 
the everyday use of computers. From 
bedroom to office, from business to TV 
studio, the Amiga had a loyal following.

pushed - depending on 
whose account you choose 
to believe. His departure marked a 
growing dissatisfaction towards the 
management among the Atari staff. 
Kassar had been a vice-president of the 
world's largest textile company — staff 
dubbed him the 'towel czar' and when 
he became aware of it, Kassar is said 
to have retorted that the programmers 
were 'prima donna towel designers'. 
Kassar knew nothing about electronics 
development and everything about 
marketing. The anger generated by 
his blank refusal to pay out royalties 
was further exacerbated through a 
financial sleight of hand. By 1979 Atari 
was 'rolling in money' through sales 
of millions of 2600s and games, but 
according to Miner, Warner decided to 
write off all the development costs of the 
first year of production, which resulted 
in such a small profit it didn't trigger a 
design progressed, 
it became clear 
to Bushnell that 
his pockets lacked 
the financial depth required 
to market what he was convinced 
would be a big hit and sought outside 
investors. In 1976 he sold out to Warner 
Communications while remaining 
ceo of the company. With the capital 
injection from Warner, Atari released 
the vcs in August 1977 to widespread 
acclaim.
On completing his work on the 
vcs, Miner began work on Atari's first 
8-bit personal computers, which would 
debut in 1980. He directed designs for 
the antic (Alphanumeric Television 
Interface Controller) and ctia (Color 
Television Interface Adaptor) chips 
found in the Atari 800 and 400 models.
Disagreements over the company's 
future direction grew increasingly 
fractious between Bushnell and his new 
bosses in New York, and particularly 
with Ray Kassar who Warner 
Communication had hired as president 
of Atari's consumer division. After a 
particularly vicious argument at the end 
of 1978 Bushnell either jumped or was

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Musical chairs in software land
The Amiga would be conceived and born 
amid the turmoil subsequently dubbed 
the North American video game crash 
of 1983. The Japanese called the crash 
'Atari Shock' and in truth Atari was one 
of the biggest culprits, as Miner claimed. 
'Atari started to produce a bunch of junk 
cartridges, thinking that the public would 
buy anything.' In less than two years 
revenues of the companies involved in 
the market collapsed by almost 97% from 
$3.2 billion in 1983 to $100 million.
On leaving Atari, Miner spent three 
years at a small technology company 
called Zimast developing microprocessor-
controlled heart pacemakers for health 
company Intermedics (getting co-patents 
on two devices). It was at Zimast that 
Larry Kaplan came back into the frame. 
pay out of previously promised bonuses 
to the engineers and programmers. 
Among them was Larry Kaplan, chief 
programmer on the 8-bit development 
who had joined Atari in 1976. He'd 
had enough by August 1979 and left to 
go and co-found Activision along with 
colleagues David Crane (Pitfall!, Laser 
Blast), Alan Miller (Starmaster, Robot 
Tank), and Bob Whitehead (Skiing, 
Chopper Command).
In a 1988 interview 
Jay Miner, left behind 
temporarily, said that this 
expected defection 'was the beginning of 
the end for the old Atari'.  Nevertheless 
he plugged away promoting the 
development of an advanced 68000 
machine to compete with Apple, but 
Warner and Kassar had no appetite 
for it, insisting on continued use of 
the dated 6502 cpu: 'So I quit, as did 
nearly all the rest of the engineers and 
programmers.'

and Alan Miller.
'Activision! Bringing

and original home 
video games!' shouted 
the 1982 corporate 
promotional video, but 
Larry Kaplan was soon 
to be reunited with Jay 
Miner in a new venture.

the games, I was going to design the 
chips [at Zimast] and Zimast was 
going to build the chips,' Miner said. 
It didn't quite work out that way, 
however. Kaplan's involvement was 
to prove short-lived. On receiving an 
offer from Ray Kassar late in 1982 to 
return to Atari as vice-president of the 
vcs software group and because 'things 
weren't going fast enough for Larry', 
Kaplan bailed. Morse asked Miner to 
take Kaplan's place as chief engineer and 
vice president of Hi-Toro, which meant 
his leaving Zimast.
Even without Larry Kaplan, the 
investors still wanted their game 
company...but they also wanted a return 
on their investment. And that meant 
games and a new video games machine. 
What Miner wanted was a new super 
computer based around the 68000 cpu. 
His strategy was to build a machine 
that could be 'sold in a stripped down, 
low-cost version for video games,' while 
ensuring it was also 'unlimited in its 
expandability as a high-level home 
personal computer'.
As they often do, memories differ slightly. 
Miner recalled that Kaplan phoned him 
to say he was unhappy with Activision 
and 'did I know anybody with money who 
could help him start a new company'.
From Larry Kaplan's perspective his 
contact with Miner came because of a 
consortium that had approached Kaplan 
about wanting to invest in a new video 
game company and whether Jay would 
be interested to come in with him. The 
investors included a Texan oil baron and 
three 'dentists from Florida'; the Texan 
had interests in the sale of pacemaker 
chips, which is how he knew Zimast.
In a later interview with Scott 
Stilphen, Kaplan cited his main reason 
for leaving Activision in June 1982 as 
'to start a game hardware company...
to build a replacement for the vcs, since 
no one had done anything comparable. 
I had hooked up with Jay Miner and 
Doug Neubauer [designer of the 1979 
Star Raiders and later Solaris in 1986] 
and an investor involved with Jay 
Miner's company.'
In Jay Miner's recall he introduced 
Kaplan to his Zimast boss, Bert 
Braddock, who knew people with 
money, like the Texan oilman, and 
Braddock set them up with a business 
plan, small premises and a ceo in the 
form of vice-president of marketing at 
Tonka Toys, Dave Morse (1943-2007). 
Morse and Kaplan set up in September 
1982 as Hi-Toro (hi-tech and Texan 
sounding) at 3350 Scott Boulevard, 
Santa Clara. 'Larry was going to design

console. A standard joystick could be 
plugged into the device if needed for 
extra input. The peripherals already 
carried the Amiga branding, which 
came about when it was discovered that 
a Japanese lawn mower company had 
the name Hi-Toro. Dave Morse chose 
Amiga - 'female friend' - for the new 
designation and soon after the company 
was renamed Amiga Corporation.
Hi-Toro's first efforts at 
generating revenue were aimed at 
expanding the Atari console Jay Miner 
admired through peripherals like 
joysticks. The Joyboard was an unusual 
and very physical add-on which the 
player controlled standing 
balanced on top, and 
which can be seen as 
an ancestor of the 
Wii Balance Board 
and an example 
of Miner's forward 
thinking. Leaning in 
a direction activated four directional 
switches, which became inputs for the 
LOOK MA! NO HANDS! 
The Joyboard 'Power 
Body Control' aimed to 
bring a new physicality 
to games playing. It was 
ahead of its time, but 
the innovation failed to 
find the wide sales 
Hi-Toro hoped for 
through a lack of 
software support.
Off Your Rocker 
drew inspiration 
from Simon, the 
electronic 
memory game 
invented by 
Ralph H. Baer and 
Howard J. Morrison, 
in which the player 
has to repeat a series 
of tones and lights. 
The Joyboard needed games that 
made best use of its capabilities, but they 
were thin on the ground. Only three 
were developed. Mogul Maniac, a skiing 
game, went on sale packaged with the 
Joyboard. Off Your Rocker - described as 
a 'simple game and lots of fun to play' - 
had one to four players repeating colours 
and patterns 'Rockin' Rollie' created on 
screen by leaning this way and that on 
the Joyboard, although it was primarily 
designed to be played using a joystick. 
It was eventually manufactured and sold 
by Pleasant Valley Video Company. 

to sitting in the Lotus position on a 
Joyboard. The aim was to stay balanced 
for as long as possible. This became 
known as 'Guru Meditation' and the 
name would eventually find its way 
into the error message text the Amiga 
generated when it crashed...
Amiga never released the unfinished 
Surf 's Up game, apparently designed for 
the Joyboard.
Miner's dual-development strategy 
in effect was to divide Hi-Toro into two 
units under the leadership of Morse 
leading a recruited team of marketers for 
the video games business and joystick, 
Joyboard and game carts; Miner to head 
up chip design for his new computer. 
Following on from a tradition started 
at Atari, he usually named development 
systems after women and codenamed 
the new platform after his ceo's wife, 
Lorraine Morse.
For Lorraine, Miner came up with 
innovative new designs for the custom 
chips centred - at last! - around a 
Motorola 68000 processor. This was 
a genuine 16-bit advancement on the 
chips contained in other consoles and 
computers, with three custom chips 
supporting the main processor (see side 
panel on the following page). The Joyboard 
found an entirely unpredicted role in 
Lorraine's conception. Developing 
this new technology was not 
easy. To help them relax after 
another crash, the engineers took

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
 
Chips for Lorraine
Continuing the Atari tradition each of 
the custom chips had a female name. 
Agnus (contraction from Address 
Generator Units): controlled how the 
processor and the other chips accessed 
memory, synchronised to the display 
output. The 'blitter' (bit-block fast 
transfer of data without the intervention 
of the processor) allowed Agnus to move 
large areas of the screen display quickly. 
'I read about blitters in one of the 
computer magazines and this seemed the 
ideal low cost way to improve animation 
such as flight simulators,' Miner said.
While the 'copper' (co-processor) 
allowed changes in graphic output as the 
screen was refreshed. Agnus also had the 
ability to synchronise the display 
output with an external signal, 
which made the Amiga ideal for 
generating graphics for use on 
TV by avoiding the flicker effect 
often seen on monitors or TV 
screens in studio situations.
Daphne (later renamed Denise, 
a contraction from Display 
Enabler): was responsible for 
handling the graphics, both the 
background modes and hardware 
sprites. Working with the copper 
and blitter, it allowed rapid 
changing between modes and 
higher numbers of sprites on-screen. 
Denise also handled inputs from the 
mouse and joysticks.
Paula (Ports, Audio, uart and Logic, 
and also the name of a designer's 
girlfriend): contained the sound 
functions, four channels capable of 
playing 8-bit pcm samples. Paula also 
acted as the floppy disk controller and 
read data from the serial I/O port. 
This gave access to many different disk 
formats, as well as the possibility of 
reading midi and other signals.
The Amiga chipset underwent several 
revisions. Here are the key differences 
and the changes in chip names.
Below: the flickery 
rolling artefact caused  
when a display is not 
synchronised with the 
video camera recording 
it. The Amiga avoided 
this with the Agnus chip.

Boot it
The Amiga operating system should 
actually be considered in three separate 
parts. The Kickstart section is responsible 
for starting the machine and putting 
the basic functions into memory. This 
includes Exec, the 'microkernel' that 
allows for multitasking. The user is then 
prompted for a disk from which to boot. 
This can contain the Workbench (the 
graphical interface) or a custom boot 
disk, as used by many games and utilities. 
During this boot process the remainder 
of the operating system is loaded into 
memory or accessed from disk as 
required. Advanced users can drop to the 
cli (Command Line Interface) to enter 
commands directly.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
        
Disk operations were handled by 
Paula and Amiga dos. The original plans 
were for a complex system designed to 
work well with multitasking, known as 
caos (Commodore Amiga Operating 
System). In the end, its slow pace of 
development left Commodore needing 
a faster solution. TripOS, designed by 
Doctor Tim King at the University of 
Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 
the UK, was purchased and rebuilt for 
the Amiga as Amiga dos. But it was not 
optimised for a 16-bit computer, 
resulting in disk access 
slowing down the machine.  
Artist Sheryl Knowles 
drew the famous image of 
the hand holding a floppy 
disk. She held the disk in her 
left hand for reference, as she 
was right-handed. Of course 
on some models of Amiga this made 
inserting the disk very difficult, as the 
drive was located on the right-hand side 
of the machine.
Thanks for the memory
The way that the Amiga handled 
memory was different to other machines. 
Agnus acted as the gatekeeper, but the 
processor could access other parts of 
memory faster. The first 512k of memory 
is known as Chip ram - this has to be 
accessed at the speed of Agnus, allowing 
her to perform operations without 
processor interference. The rest of the 
memory is known as Fast ram, as the 
processor can access this directly at its 
own speed. In later models with faster 
processors this improved memory access 
speeds. Fatter Agnus allowed up to 1mb 
of Chip ram, and Super Agnus (in the 
Enhanced Chipset) could access 2mb of 
Chip ram when available.
Colours of the rainbow
The Amiga can handle up to 4096 
colours, but the amount on the screen 
depends on the mode chosen. Many 
games use the lower resolution modes, 
allowing 32 colours on screen at 320x200 
or 320x400 pixels. (Overscan mode 
gives a larger screen area, going into the 
'borders' on a television or monitor).
To store the colour data in memory, 
the Amiga uss bitplanes - sections of 
memory designated to the colour. These 
can be manipulated in real time to create 
special effects, or under interrupts using 
the copper. The more bitplanes, the 
more colours on-screen - at the expense 
of more memory used. The 32-colour 
modes, for example, use 5 bitplanes - that 
is: 5 bits per pixel.
There was also the special 'dual 
playfield' mode. This splits the display 
into two parts, a foreground and a 
background each with their own set of 
3 bitplanes (giving 15 colours in the 
foreground and 16 in the background).

the full Hold-And-
Modify palette of 4096

Colour 0 in the foreground is always 
transparent, allowing the background 
to be seen through it. This is ideal for 
games with parallax scrolling and moving 
backgrounds.
Extra-Half-Brite mode is unusual. 
Using ehb mode, the Amiga can be 
made to display 64 colours on-screen at 
once using a special hardware trick where 
the additional 32 colours are exactly half 
the brightness of the palettes's original 
32 colours. Much like ham mode, ehb 
mode was only really useful for static 
displays and its main purpose was to add 
shadowing effects toan image. It was a 
feature missing from early Amiga 1000s. 
Hold me
Hold-And-Modify (ham) mode was an 
unusual addition to the original Amiga 
design. In theory this gives full access to 
all 4096 colours on a single screen. But 
the time needed to plot such a screen 
using multiple bitplanes makes it only 
really usable with static images and those 
with subtle transitions of colour. Instead 
of storing every colour for every pixel, 
ham mode stores the change in colour. 
Jay Miner had doubts about the 
mode late in development. 'The Hold-
And-Modify feature of the Amiga 
was left over from the time the ntsc 
television conversion was on the chips,' 
he said at the time. 'I almost took the 
ham off the chips since it wasn't very 
useful with rgb colour.'
But the chip designers realised that 
removing it would leave a big hole in 
the chip and necessitate it being laid out 
again so it was left in. ham mode would 
prove to be important for displaying 
photographs and digitised images. Very 
few games used ham mode. Among the 
select few that did are Pioneer Plague and 
Knights of the Crystallion. 
Deluxe Paint IV supported ham, using 
the copper to split between its menus 
and the detailed images. Digi‑View from 
NewTek used ham to display digitised 
images. ham8 mode would arrive with 
the aga chipset. The aga palette can 
choose from a range of 16.7 million 
colours but can only display 256 on the 
screen at once in regular display mode, 
but up to 262,000 colours in ham8 mode.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Give me a new 64
In the early 1980s technical 
development and financial politics 
went hand in hand or, rather, head 
to head. The previously mentioned 
North American video game crash of 
1983 almost brought Lorraine to a 
standstill.
'So there we were, designing this 
super graphic computer with four 
blitter channels, eight sprites and four 
sound channels, and the bottom just fell 
out of the video game market,' Miner 
said. 'This killed the joystick half of the 
company, and the cartridge market and 
that half of Amiga started losing money 
fast. It seemed like we owed money 
to every supplier in town. I had to 
mortgage practically everything I owned 
personally to help meet the company 
payroll.'
Morse and Miner approached Atari 
who had expressed an interest in using 
the Lorraine chips for their computers 
once development was finished. The 
company offered a deal - $500,000 as a 
loan to keep Hi-Toro/Amiga running 
and continue development of the new 
custom chips. But the deal came with 
a serious restriction on Miner's future 
freedom with Lorraine.
'They got real tough...just about 
the time that [Jack] Tramiel was 
buying Atari.'
Tough meant exclusive use of 
the new chipset for a year, ostensibly 
for a planned 68000-based machine. 
Miner had little choice...but Atari 
was in trouble from the 'bunch of junk 
cartridges', largely 'mangled adaptions of 
arcade games' that resulted in a glut of 
unappealing games. Under Ray Kassar's 
management Atari had gone from 
representing almost a third of all Warner 
Communication's annual revenues 
to making a staggering loss, and was 
haemorrhaging $1 million a day. Warner 
wanted rid of it.
At about this time, with the 
Commodore 64 flying high but 
aware of the dangers of standing still, 
Commodore International's founder 
Jack Tramiel wanted to raise money 
through a shares issue to invest in the 
development of a 16/32-bit computer 
Bosses at Warner 
Communications wanted 
out of loss-making Atari. 
In buying it, Commodore 
founder Jack Tramiel 
almost got his hands 
on the Amiga-to-be to 
replace the high-flying 
Commodore 64.
Oliver Frey

before anyone else's new-generation 
machines wiped out the C64. Financier 
and chairman Irving Gould - tarred a bit 
with the Ray Kassar brush - disagreed. 
Tramiel also wanted to install his sons 
in senior positions at Commodore 
International, a move that Gould was 
resisting. The matter came to a head 
and Tramiel was forced out in January 
1984 - taking several senior figures 
with him into his newly formed Tramel 
[sic] Technology, Ltd. He was on the 
lookout to acquire a development and 
manufacturing company. In the process 
he spoke with Amiga, but Tramiel was 
only interested in the chips not the staff, 
so that deal fell through.
He had entered into negotiations 
with Warner as he set his engineers to 
work on the next generation low-cost 
personal computer. Work was nearing 
completion when Tramiel concluded 
a deal in July 1984 with a Warner 
desperate to get rid of Atari's Consumer 
Division - all the bits that mattered to 
Tramiel - which he acquired for a very 
low price.
Now lawsuit and counter-lawsuit 
started to fly. First Commodore 
accused its former employees of taking 
intellectual property to Atari - an 
accusation supported by the incredibly 
rapid development of what would 
become the Atari ST series.
Tramiel, in the process of cancelling 
on-going Atari projects to review those 
worth keeping, discovered the Amiga-
Atari deal for the Lorraine chipset he'd 
originally wanted himself. Meanwhile 
Jay Miner, Dave Morse and Amiga were 
supposed to deliver the chipset to Atari 
by the end of June 1984 or be in default, 
but funds were low, development was 
behind and they risked losing the entire 
business with all its potential.
They needed funding, quickly. But 
what was the point of going back to Jack 
Tramiel, who was already negotiating 
to buy Atari? He had already said all he 
wanted from Amiga was the physical 
property, not the people. So instead 
they approached Commodore for a cash 
injection. In the event, Commodore 
bought Amiga Corporation outright and 
sent Atari the $500,000 in repayment of 
the amount invested earlier into Amiga 
for the Lorraine development.
Immediately, Tramiel countersued 
Commodore through its new Amiga 
subsidiary for breaching the terms of 
their contract and gaining an injunction 
of further development at Amiga. It 
took months to settle, a period which 
gave Atari a head start on getting to 
market with the ST. The downside for 
Commodore financier 
and chairman Irving 
Gould, above, fell out 
with Jack Tramiel over 
a new machine for 
Commodore and the 
installing of Tramiel's 
sons in the business - 
Garry, Sam and Jack

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Atari, lacking Lorraine, was the cheaper 
components used, a single-sided floppy 
drive and the Yamaha fm sound chip. It 
too was based around a 68000 processor 
but lacked an operating system of its own. 
Tramiel teamed up with Digital Research, 
Inc. to create an O/S combined with 
Digital's gem graphical interface, which 
became known as tos - The Operating 
System, also sometimes referred to as 
Tramiel Operating System - with its own 
green-coloured variation on the desktop.
One reporter described a prototype as 
a 'typical Commodore-64-style, corner 
cutting, low cost Jack Tramiel product.'
Lorraine sees the light of day
In all this chaos - and the continuing 
uncertainty in the American games 
market (by this time the games market 
for the ZX Spectrum and C64 in Britain 
was flying) - the Amiga team plugged 
away as best they could and a prototype 
breadboard was completed late in 1983, 
in time to reveal Lorraine to selected 
guests at the January 1984 Consumer 
Electronics Show (ces) in Las Vegas.
'We made a motherboard for the 
breads to be plugged in, took this to 
ces and we showed some little demos 
to selected people away from the main 
floor,' Miner later said. 'They couldn't 
believe that all this wiring was going to 
be three chips!'
To transport the fragile series of large 
breadboards with wires connecting them  
by plane the engineers wrapped the demo 
machine in pillows and booked an extra 
seat under the name of the mysterious 
developer known as Joe Pillow.
Writing in the April 1984 issue 
of Creative Computing magazine, 
technology journalist John J. Anderson 
(1956-1989) expressed his admiration. 
'If there was a "hit" of the show for 
me, it had to be my first glimpse of 
the supermicro codenamed Lorraine 
by Amiga.'  There was no hint of the 
machine in the Amiga booth, 'but with 
an invitation to step behind the secret 
panel, my jaw finally got a chance to 
drop. Yes, Amiga. The people who 
brought you the Joyboard. Hard for me 
to believe too. To hear it from Dave 
Morse, president of Amiga, the joysticks 
and peripheral accessory products we 
have seen from the company up until 
now have served well to bankroll the 
Lorraine - the real project front and 
center on the drawing board.'
According to the technology journalist 
it seemed as if Lorraine was well on 
the way to floor the market as well, but 
with a caveat: 'Amiga is also like Atari 
in another respect - it must overcome 
its current reputation before it can be 
taken seriously. Okay, fellas. Let's put the 
Joyboard behind us and get credible. The 
Lorraine just may be the machine that 
hundreds of thousands of graphics and 
sound enthusiasts have been waiting for 
since the introduction of the Atari.'
Above: rare (and poor 
qualIty) images showing 
Amiga's booth at the 
January ces Show, 1984 
- the exterior and the 
'secret' inner chamber 
housing Lorraine and 
a screen displaying 
the first version of the 
bouncing ball demo.
"If there was a 'hit' of the show for me, 
it had to be...the supermicro codenamed 
Lorraine by Amiga."

John Pandaris writing in Amiga World 
was brimming over with suprise: 'I stood 
up straighter, lost my cynical sneer, gaped 
rather stupidly and elbowed my neighbors 
in the ribs. The Amiga had cracked my 
armor—with sheer, naked power.'
Over a series of computer shows 
and events throughout 1984 and 1985 
the new and still developing Amiga was 
demonstrated to the press and public. 
Those shows created a buzz around the 
Amiga as it slowly became a reality. Byte 
magazine devoted thirteen pages to a 
preview article on the computer, while 
Creative Computing described it as 'a 
dream machine', and Compute declared 
it 'the first true personal computer'. The 
debut issue of Amiga World magazine 
stated on the cover 'The Future Is Here'.
Vital contributors to the buzz were 
the demos (see side panel below and 
over the page) - including the famous 
bouncing ball - to show off Lorraine's 
then astonishing 4096 colours and other 
capabilities that had Anderson dancing 
with excitement. 'The software boys, 
easily identifiable by their well-worn 
Adidas and gleeful smiles, had spent 
a little over a week devising demos 
for Lorraine, further hampered by a 
diskless I/O system. They still managed 
in a series of short programs to convey 
enough of Lorraine's powers to floor me. 
Amazing graphics and sound.'
Amiga Dream Demos
Showing the potential of the Amiga 
was an important series of demos. 
The earliest was known as Robo City, 
seen on the right, which showed off 
a vibrant colour palette and also the 
Amiga's built-in sprite and collision 
detection features that allowed large 
animated characters to move over 
complex backgrounds and interact with 
each other. Then came the Boing Ball 
demo. A bouncing ball with a rotating 
checkerboard pattern appeared on the 
screen.
To add impact, they added stereo 
sound - the sample perfectly timed 
to each bounce. The booming noise 
of the ball was Bob Pariseau hitting a 
foam baseball bat against a garage door, 
recorded by sound engineer Sam Dicker.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
He sampled it on an Apple II and then 
massaged the result into Amiga samples 
for Paula. 
The bouncing ball became adopted as 
the unofficial Amiga logo. Later came The 
Cat, a photorealistic stalking tabby shown 
in a 3D rotating screen, and The Juggler, a 
short animation designed to show off the 
processing power of the Amiga. 
Eric Graham was the man behind the 
Top: the rotating 
walking cat, 2D in 3D.
Centre: that famous 
bouncing ball and under

Juggler animation. Graham rendered the 
frames in a raytracer program he wrote 
called SSG. The software used a script 
that described where the objects were, 
their surfaces, including how reflective 
they were, and the points where light 
shone from. The program then rendered 
the final image by ray tracing, calculating 
the light rays striking and reflecting 
from objects. The rendered images were 

encoded in the Amiga's ham display 
mode and then assembled into a single 
data file using a lossless delta compression 
scheme similar to the method that would 
later be adopted as the standard in the 
Amiga's anim file format.
Graham developed the software to 
become Sculpt3D, a fully-featured utility 
for drawing and rendering 3D scenes. 
Later versions included the ability to 
generate animations and became the 
forerunner of the tools used for sculpting 
3D objects used today in games and 
film. 'Behold the robot juggling spheres,' 
he wrote in Amiga World. 'He stands 
firmly on the landscape...he is only 
a microchip phantom, yet he casts a 
shadow. You can see his reflection in the 
refined orbs he so deftly tosses...Though 
he looks strangely real, he exists only in 
the memory of the Amiga.'
Eric Graham's was not the first 
example of computer-generated 
raytracing. Turner Whitted's paper of 
1980 is widely regarded as the first 
modern description of raytracing 
methods in computer graphics. This 
paper's famous image of balls floating 
above a checkerboard floor took 74 
minutes to render on a dec vax 11/780 
mainframe, a $400,000 computer. The 
Juggler would appear a mere six years 
later, created and displayed on a $2000 
Amiga.

just money, there was also technical 
input. '[Commodore] made many 
improvements in the chips. They made 
a lot of improvements in the things 
that we wanted but we did not have the 
resources to accomplish. The Amiga 
originally only had 320 colours across 
the screen, even in the 640 mode. They

'Commodore was very good for Amiga 
in the beginning,' Jay Miner said of his 
new bosses. 'They paid off our creditors 
including my loans to the company and 
they got us a beautiful facility [ten miles 
away] in Los Gatos.'
In an interesting side note, it was said 
that those mythical 'Florida dentists' got 
their investment back with interest when 
Commodore bought Amiga.
According to Miner, it wasn't

a computer."

detection, multi-tasking with several 
animated demos all running at once, 
four-channel synthesised sound, a dig at 
IBM with the very first demonstration 
of an IBM PC emulator running 
pc-dos. But the real highlight came 
when famed (infamous?) artist Andy 
Warhol appeared with Blondie singer 
Debbie Harry. They were on hand to 
demonstrate the machine's graphic 
capabilities by Warhol drawing a 
portrait of Debby live on stage. 'What 
other computers have you worked with?' 
resident Amiga artist Jack Hager asked. 
With his trademark deadpan voice 
Warhol answered, 'I haven't worked on 
anything. I've been waiting for this one.'
However, the engineers were worried 
that the machine might crash when 
Warhol used the 'flood fill' tool of 
ProPaint, which was known to have bugs 
and a tendency to crash the computer 
every second time it was used, but to 
their relief it kept working. However, 
production problems delayed the market 
launch and it would still be months 
before machines hit the shops, 
threatening to undo the 
excitement and press support 
that had built up.
Commodore needed 
software to be ready for launch, 
and so gave out development 
systems to key publishing 
companies. Among the 
first to get an 
Amiga was 
mode. They also improved the colour by 
moving the ntsc converter off the chip.' 
Commodore also provided each member 
of the development team with their own 
Sun workstation, when before ten had to 
share a single Sage.
Lorraine finally debuted officially 
on 23 July 1985 as the 'Amiga from 
Commodore' (later dubbed Amiga 
1000 when it went into production) 
with a massive fanfare, as Jay Miner 
remembered. '[Commodore] sent the 
entire company including wives and 
sweethearts out to New York for a grand 
launching party in New York City. 
And what a party that was, tuxedos, 
champagne...all just to launch a 
computer. They really did it top notch.'
For the press launch Commodore 
hired the Vivian Beaumont Theater at 
the prestigious Lincoln Center where in 
a well orchestrated sequence of events 
the Amiga 1000 kicked up its heels 
and showed its paces, the flexibility of 
the new graphical user interface, its

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Although the first Amiga 1000 
reached the market in July 1985, the 
production hold-ups meant it did not 
become widely available until early 
1986. Interestingly the Commodore 
name was not on the machine, but 
it did feature two Amiga keys (with 
the stylised capital A). Jay Miner had 
insisted on the possibility of expanding 
the machine, and wanted more memory. 
It shipped with just 256k and the 
Kickstart operating system needed to be 
loaded from a 3.5-inch floppy disk. The 
signatures of Miner and the developers 
were immortalised in the plastic case - 
along with the paw-print of Miner's dog 
Mitchy.
A failure of conviction
After Jack Tramiel's abrupt departure 
from Commodore in January 1984 
Irving Gould appointed former steel 
executive Marshall F Smith to take 
over, but it was a short-lived reign. 
Under Smith's watch Commodore stock 
dropped from almost $65 per share to 
less than $5. Commodore needed a new 
ceo and in April 1986 former Pepsi ceo 
Thomas Rattigan took the helm, moving 
up from Commodore's coo to ceo. 
back to the adventure films of his youth. 
It would be the name of the Cinemaware 
label that people remembered, and 
the hard work of former Amiga 
developer RJ Mical that gave them 
a game engine. Defender of the 
Crown became a jewel in Amiga's crown, 
showing off the potential of the machine 
with its impressive graphics (much of 
which were created by artist Jim Sachs, 
see page 212) and sound (with music 
composed by Jim Cuomo).
A new level of quality 
in the graphics of 
Defender of the Crown.

Apple had hired Rattigan's predecessor 
John Sculley, inventor of the Pepsi 
Challenge, from Pepsi-Cola so perhaps 
Irving Gould was hoping for a similar 
boost from a soft drinks executive.
Rattigan had his work cut out. A 
poor advertising campaign for the 
Amiga 1000  in the US (using stock 
photos) was badly received and initial 
sales were poor compared to the rival 
Macintosh launched in 1984 with its 
attention-grabbing Super Bowl TV 
advert. (At one point Rattigan put 
forward the idea of an Apple takeover

that Commodore cut its expenses. So it 
cut heavily into the engineering facility 
in West Chester and also at the Amiga 
facility in Los Gatos. A 70% or so cut in 
engineering in Westchester still left fifty 
or so people in engineering but similar 
cuts at Amiga left only ten. People 
started giving notice and quitting but 
Commodore stuck to its policy of no 
raises and no replacements.'
In spite of these cuts Miner and his 
reduced team managed to finish the 1.2 
software release, and design a revised set 
of custom chips for the next generation 
of Amiga computers. 'Amiga did these 
things, not Commodore,' Miner said.
Germany makes the running
It is worth remembering Commodore's 
unusual structure to appreciate what 
happened over the next few years. 
Jack Tramiel had started the original 
company in Canada in 1953, initially 
manufacturing typewriters and then 
moving into office furniture. A share 
scandal involving the bank that had 
financed Commodore (with no apparent 
involvement of Tramiel or Commodore) 
left Tramiel needing a new investor. 
In stepped Irving Gould, who then 
- seeing it as the best place to develop 
the Amiga hardware further, but Gould 
couldn't see it.) 
Speaking to Amiga User International 
in 1988, Jay Miner was scathing about 
Commodore's advertising campaign...
what there was of it compared to 
Apple's. 'I can't tell you how angry it 
makes me feel to see how the Amiga 
was handled. The advertisements they 
did have were absolutely awful. Old men 
changing into babies and kids competing 
in race cars. It was ghastly. And then 
a full year with no ads at all. They lost 
dealers and worst of all they lost public 
awareness.'
In a continuing downward spiral 
Rattigan carried on cost cutting and 
downsizing, in the process pretty much 
exterminating the team that had been 
Amiga Corporation.
'It's a sad story,' Jay Miner said. 'The 
sales of the Amiga didn't zoom up as 
fast as they had hoped. Though it sold 
as many as the Macintosh did in its 
first period, there weren't enough sales 
to cover its expenses. The bank insisted 
Commodore messed 
up the commercials for 
the Amiga 1000. They
were off the target - at 
one end concentrating 
too hard on positioning 
the machine as a 
business computer, 
while missing its games 
potential with poor 
understanding of game-
player demographics.
"Old men changing into babies and kids 
competing in race cars. It was ghastly."

appealed 
to gamers and 
those upgrading from 8-bit. 
It would take time to turn around the 
Amiga's fortunes, and it came in the 
shape of the Amiga 500. This was one 
of the moves Rattigan put forward. The 
machine was released some six months 
earlier in Europe than America, which 
under Rattigan is where Commodore 
action seemed to have moved, as Jay 
Miner recalled.
'Commodore laid off more people 
in Los Gatos and closed it. Let's face 
reality, Los Gatos was a very expensive 
place...our rent per square foot was 
twice what Commodore paid in West 
Chester, [PA]. Commodore didn't like 
paying gobs of money to support Amiga 
when their German and West Chester 
design teams could design better 
boxes faster and cheaper. Those teams 
promised to have the 500 and the 2000 
ready by September 1986...but they 
were still more than a year late.'
It must have hurt that the 'foreign' 
teams were using the original Amiga 
team's chips and software, and refusing 
to continue support of the 1000. '[They] 
refused to cost-reduce the 1000 line. 
Because, in my opinion, they didn't want 
a low-cost 1000 to compete with West 
Chester's keyboard-attached 500.'
Irving Gould cancelled the original 
proceeded to keep a tight rein on the 
purse strings. Tramiel was not given funds 
to expand the company and there was 
no rights issue to bolster the finances.
A new entity, Commodore 
International, was incorporated in the 
Bahamas to take advantage of its lower 
tax rates. Subsidiary companies were set 
up in the UK and Germany, with the 
aim of manufacturing and promoting 
the Commodore machines in highly 
profitable territories. These subsidiaries 
had a fair degree of autonomy in terms 
of advertising and development. 
It was in Germany that perhaps the 
most unusual add-on for the original 
Amiga was developed. This was called 
the Sidecar, because of the way it was 
designed to sit beside the main computer. 
Inside was an Intel 8088 processor and 
the heart of an xt pc-compatible. Data 
could be exchanged between the pc 
and Amiga, and the pc side included 
a hard drive - the first example of that 
technology Commodore marketed for 
the Amiga. While it gave access to 
ms-dos software, the incompatibility 
with the later Amiga 500 and high price 
would make it a niche product.

it became clear its lower price point

the company. An independent firm 
of business auditors from Dallas was 
brought in at Gould's request. The final 
report seemed intent on undermining 
the successful work Rattigan had 
achieved - a steady growth in sales 
and the whole company running at 
a profit after five quarters of losses. 
Rattigan would ultimately be fired after 
working just one year of his five-year 
contract, leading to a long-running and 
acrimonious lawsuit. 
Visually, Rattigan's baby - the 
'keyboard-attached' Amiga 500 - and 
the Atari ST are a similar shape. The 
keyboard has a wedge shape leading to 
the back, where the ports are located, 
and a 3.5-inch floppy drive on the side. 
While the ST's built-in midi ports gave 
it a boost with musicians, it was the 
video output that formed a lucrative 
market for the Amiga. The famous 
Video Toaster from NewTek was 
what is known as a genlock, 
synchronising the computer 
output with existing video. From 
captions for a television show 
to the advanced cgi seen on 
Babylon 5 and seaQuest DSV, 
the Amiga became a favourite 
of television stations and graphic editors. 
Another key change in Commodore's 
fortunes came with the bundle concept. 
Retailers had already been offering 
package deals, with a computer and 
several games, to new buyers. Managaing 
Director David Pleasance and 
Commodore UK took that idea further. 
Amiga 2000 being completed in Los 
Gatos in June of 1986 on the grounds 
that it only had two ibm card slots 
instead of three and the Amiga slots 
were not shaped enough like ibm cards. 
Miner felt there was another reason 
for the cancellation. 'Commodore 
were convinced that their 500 and 
German-made 2000 would be ready by 
September 1986, so why advertise the 
1000 when there wouldn't be any around 
soon?'
The Amiga people were not the 
only ones unhappy with Rattigan. 
As his profile grew, so Irving Gould 
became less happy about his running

workforce, cancelling projects and firing 
engineers. Many saw him as squandering 
the chance that Rattigan had given 
Commodore with the Amiga, others 
upset that Ali was attempting to turn 
Commodore into a new corporate giant 
aping IBM rather than the innovative 
company it had once been.
America was of course a big market 
for the Amiga, but it rapidly gained 
a loyal following throughout Europe. 
Many Commodore 64 fans upgraded. 
The thriving demoscene found new 
and greater ways to push the Amiga 
hardware, showing off their work at 
regular demo parties (see pages 70-89). 
And piracy played a big part too. Some 
companies revealed as many as ten 
pirate copies existed for each game 
sold. Swapping and mail trading gave 
access to the latest games, with groups 
competing to crack and spread new 
releases faster than their rivals. XCopy 
Approaching software house Ocean, 
Commodore gambled on the big-budget 
Tim Burton 'Dark Knight' adaptation 
of Batman and its licensed video-game

say is that those guys had incredible 
foresight and huge balls to go along with 
my idea,' Pleasance later said. Ocean 
offered the game for free but Pleasance 
stuck to his plan of paying a royalty for 
each unit sold - and the Batman pack 
sold in large numbers, swelling the 
coffers of both companies.

and other programs were needed to copy 
disks, but users had to be aware of the 
dreaded 'virus'.
The Swiss Cracking Association 
produced the first virus to gain notoriety. 
The sca virus, which appeared in 
November 1987, lurked in the boot 
sector of a disk and every fifteenth time 
the disk was booted a message appeared.
Something wonderful has happened. 
Your AMIGA is alive !!! and, even 
better... Some of your disks are infected 
by a VIRUS !!! Another masterpiece of 
The Mega-Mighty SCA !!
It was not made to be destructive, 
but by copying itself automatically to 
the boot sector of any disk that wasn't 
write-protected, the sca virus could 
stop a game from working. It would also 
prove harmful to newer versions of the 
operating system. Later viruses included 
Byte Bandit and Glasnost, and led to the 
whole industry of creating and stopping 
viruses that plague modern hardware.
Another key area was public domain 
software. The Fred Fish disks were 
compiled and spread around the world, 
collating new and free software (games, 
utilities and graphics). The public domain 
libraries also appeared, copying pd 
software disks for a small fee. One of the 
best-known pd libraries in the UK was 
17-Bit Software. Its founders would go on 
to build one of the most respected Amiga 
software houses in the shape of Team 17.
A growing international family
Over time, new models of Amiga 
appeared - but none was a big leap 
forward. The Amiga 2000 was targeted 
at high-end and business users, again a 
design from Commodore Germany. It 
reverted to the keyboard and base unit 
design of the original Amiga 1000. The 
2000 was designed to be expandable, 
with five Zorro II slots and four pc isa 
slots internally. This gave access to scsi 
devices including early cd-roms, plus 
the chance to use pc 5.25-inch 
drives for compatibility.

between applications and automate 
tasks. Reviewers commented that there 
was little improvement in performance 
and processing speed - in spite of a 
greater disparity in price - between 
the Amiga 1000, 2000 and 500 
models, since they shared the

the Amiga 500 Plus was cheaper for 
Commodore to manufacture than the 
1000, 2000 and 500 models, but did 
feature the Enhanced Chipset, extra

Commodore. Its efforts at the trade

cartridge-based Games System built 
around existing Commodore 64 
hardware, and CD-TV.
The CD-TV unit, released 
at the end of the year, was

Plus having a short life: released in 1991 
it was discontinued within a year. 
During 1990 Commodore headed 
down another road which turned out 
to be a second cul-de-sac. 
Heading the project was Atari 
founder Nolan Bushnell. 'Back 
in the 1980s,' he told New 
Generation magazine (April 1995), 'I sold 
some technology to Commodore and 
spearheaded its movement for cdtv.'
The result was Commodore Dynamic 
Total Vision, or CD-TV. Designed as a 
set-top box that would be as ubiquitous 
as the video recorder, the machine could 
read advanced cd formats, displaying 
pictures and videos and playing back 
stereo-quality music.
As an interactive multimedia 
entertainment appliance, it shipped 
only with a remote control, however 
for $200 an expansion kit supplied 
keyboard, mouse and an external floppy 
disk drive, which turned it into a fully-
fledged Amiga computer (running under 
a modified Amigados 1.3) able to run 
most A500 software. In addition to the 
expansion kit Commodore put out an 
add-on cd-rom for existing Amigas.
Bushnell later blamed Commodore's 
high $999 selling price for its failure. 
It was supposed to launch in March 
1991 with one hundred titles heralding 
a new dawn in interactive gaming and 
entertainment. Just fifty titles made the 
launch, a mix of educational and basic 
games. Even at a lowered price point,

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Keeping the games alive 
The Amiga 600 launched in 1992 and 
also contained the Enhanced Chipset. 
It was an example of a good idea badly 
implemented through confusion between 
the American executive and European 
management, with marketing overruling 
the planners and engineers. 
As David Pleasance recognised, with 
the almost demise of the C64 (and its 
vast games base), Commodore needed 
something to take its place. He met 
Mehdi Ali and explained they needed 
a very low-cost entry-point Amiga to 
replace the 64 'with ideally a similar 
price point (£199 retail or a maximum 
of £249)'. A cheaper model for younger 
users or those just playing games would 
have made sense as the consoles were 
taking a larger market share. Indeed, 
the magazines at the time were talking 
of a reduced cost model and what an 
opportunity it presented.
The product Pleasance and his 
European colleagues wanted was a 
very basic Amiga with the potential 
for upgrading as consumers' pockets 
allowed, with the addition of hard drives, 
ram, and so on. The plan was to convert 
C64 users to the Amiga range. The new 
machine's designation should be the 
Amiga 300 to convey the idea of its 
position in the Amiga family. 'Imagine 
our surprise,' Pleasance has said, 'when 
in the UK in March of 1992 we took 
delivery of a quantity of computers with 
the model number A600.'
Mehdi Ali, it seemed, refused to sell an 
Amiga with a hard drive - a prerequisite 
for the European teams to sell the A300. 
However, the A600's design was poorly 
executed and even though it had less 
features than the A500 it cost more to 
manufacture. Being called the A600 
gave consumers the impression that 
it was a higher specification machine 
than the A500, which had a disastrous 
effect on sales of the A500. '[It] is one 
perfect example of Commodore senior 
[American] management never having 
a "plan" of any kind,' was Pleasance's 
"Imagine our surprise when in the 
UK we took delivery of a quantity of 
computers with the model number A600."

utter screw-up,' UK

opinion, one borne out by results and the 
cool press response.
The Amiga 600 was the first Amiga 
model to be manufactured in the 
UK, at Irvine in Scotland, with later 
machines manufactured in Hong Kong 
and the Philippines. It was a flawed 
stopgap  before the introduction of the 
32-bit Amiga 1200 and an unnecessary 
upgrade, with existing games requiring 
Relockick (a boot program effectively 
downgrading to the earlier Kickstart) 
to remain compatible. The lack of a 
numerical keypad also made some games 
unplayable. It was sold in two forms, 
with or without the internal hard drive.
Right machine, wrong price
The Advanced Graphic Architecture 
chipset was a jump forward for the 
Amiga, though it was too little and too 
late to save Commodore's fortunes. aga 
boosted the colour palette from 4096 
to 16.8 million, allowing 256 colours 
on screen in normal mode and 262,144 
(18-bit) in ham mode. With this huge 
boost and with its faster 68EC020 
microporcessor, the Amiga 1200 and 
4000 boasted graphics that outshone the 
16-bit consoles.
The A1200, released in October 
1992, followed the general form of its 
predecessors the Amiga 500 and 600 
in being an all-in-one design: alpha-
numeric keyboard, cpu and disk drives 
incorporated in a single housing. Hopes 
were pinned on the Amiga 1200 as a 
low-cost machine - £399 (UK), $599 
(US) - but they were not to be realised. 
The custom chips were more expensive 
to produce than chips used in other pcs, 
making the 1200 more expensive than 
Pleasance's ideal £200-£250 price point. 
To reviewers the aga chipset was a bit 
of a disappointment, some comparing 
aga unfavourably alongside continually 
improving Video Graphics Array (vga) 
on IBM PCs and clones. And there were

commentators who thought the 68020 
cpu outdated and Commodore should 
have fitted the 1200 with a 68030.
The Amiga 4000, seen as successor to 
the A2000 and A3000 computers, was 
fitted with the Motorola 68040 cpu: the 
Amiga 4000/040 appeared in tandem 
with the A1200 in October 1992 and a 
second model, designated 4000/030 and  
fitted with the 68030 cpu was released 
in April 1993.
A bid to keep ahead of the game
As the pc began to dominate and 
Windows 95 became a viable platform 
for game publishers, the Amiga needed 
a performance boost. This was the 
dawn of the co-processor, add-on chips 
designed to calculate faster. Companies 
that remained loyal to Commodore 
began developing for the new cd-based 
console, the CD32. Commodore called it 
'the first 32-bit games console', although 
in reality the FM Towns Marty was first 
to market (in Japan at least). The 32-bit 
cd-rom machine turned the Amiga line 
into a dedicated gaming console. Based 
on the aga chipset, the CD32 was of 
similar specification to the A1200, with 
a 68EC020 cpu at its heart.
By this stage, the Amiga had lost 
traction in the United States, where 
the IBM, its pc clones and Apple 
had eclipsed the Amiga line. It was 
in Europe where Amiga still scored 
and so had become the main focus of 
Commodore marketing announcements. 
So the CD32 was first revealed at 
London's Science Museum on 16 July 
1993, whereas in the US it was 
only demonstrated at the World of 
Commodore Amiga show in September 
(the same month the console hit the 
shops in Europe and Canada).
Slated for a US launch in early 
March 1994, the CD32 was never

officially sold in America. The reason was 
an injunction against Commodore for 
missing the deadline to pay $10 million 
for the use of another company's xor 
patent relating to the computer graphics 
display system. The injunction penned 
up Commodore's inventory of CD32 
consoles intended for US sales at the 
Philippines manufacturing facility until 
the debt was paid. It wasn't: shortly after, 
Commodore filed for bankruptcy.

as to why Commodore should select 
such a poor game to show off the 
CD32's advanced abilities above its 
16-bit Sega and Nintendo rivals. And 
these were not just in the graphics 
department. A bay at the back could be 
used in conjunction with an optional 
expansion card to turn the CD32 into 
a fully functioning A1200, with printer 
ports, disk drive ports, extra ram and 
faster processors, and a hard drive. 
To complete the transformation into 
an Amiga computer, an Amiga 4000 
keyboard could be plugged into the 
CD32's auxiliary port on the left side.
As for the promised games software, 
some of the major players like Ocean 
remained loyal, but the cost of cartridge-
based Nintendo and Sega games had 
broken the bank and in spite of better 
specifications than its Japanese rivals, 
Commodore had run out of financial 
steam at the point when a wave of 
powerful new consoles was coming over 
the horizon.
An ignominious end
Commodore International was 
struggling, innovation at West Chester 
was stifled and the engineering staff 
knew where to lay the blame: at Mehdi 
Ali's door.
As far back as 1985, the future was 
already looking bleak for Commodore.  
As the L.A. Times reports, Commodore 
International lost $20.8 million in the 
third quarter 1985 compared to a net 
income of $36.3 million in the same 
period of 1984, and sales were down 
by 48.5%. Ali joined Commodore in 
1986, was appointed to the board in 
1988 and finally became ceo in 1989.  
His experience in General Motors 
and Pepsico did little to turn around 
Commodore's slumping fortunes, or 
repair relations with the US retail

trade still smarting after Jack Tramiel's 
handling of affairs.
Tramiel was not a well-loved figure in 
the technology market from his previous 
Commodore days, especially with 
wholesalers and retailers, one of whom 
said of the Atari ST that after prior 
experience with Tramiel 'Our interest in 
Atari is zilch'. Another said that dealing 
with him was like 'dealing with Attila the 
Hun', echoing one of Tramiel's sayings 
that 'business is war'. His reputation hurt 
sales and his successors never recovered 
Commodore's reputation.
However, while the investors may 
have initally been happy with Mehdi 
Ali, his engineers were not and came to 
hold him and his management team in 
contempt. When Ali started cutting the 
R&D budgets new products languished. 
An example was the Amiga Advanced 
Architecture chipset (aaa) on which 
development commenced in 1989 but 
still wasn't ready in 1993, forcing a hasty 
rehash and downgrade to create the aga 
chipset instead.
Dave Haynie - chief engineer on 
high end and advanced projects wrote: 
'Things look bad at Commodore 
throughout the latter part of 1993. 
Massive staff cuts take place in the 
summer. Funds for new product 
development all but dry up by autumn. 
The long-awaited "AAA" project is 
halted for lack of money. It seems to be 
yet another case of defeat snatched from 
the jaws of victory.' †
In the corporate world mistakes were 
also made. When Sun Systems wanted 
to use Amiga's version of Unix for a low-
cost solution, Commodore demanded 
an unrealistic fortune in licensing fees 
and Sun walked, killing the Amiga's 
expansion into the Unix market.
By 1993 there was such unrest 
among Commodore stockholders at 
the failure to turn the company back to 
profit, at the lack of sales, and discontent

management, that shareholders started 
to protest and insisted on sending 
representatives to all future board 
meetings held in the Bahamas.
As the share price plummeted, the 
final nail in the coffin would prove to 
be delays for the CD32 console. With a 
large shipment from the Philippines held 
by US Customs, the lucrative Christmas 
sales were lost, resulting in Commodore 
losing $350 million in the process.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
In April 1994 Commodore 
International filed for 
Bankruptcy protection.
In those last days, Dave 
Haynie took his camcorder 
into the West Chester offices 
and recorded the scenes as the 
company died and employees 
were laid off. The remaining 
staff burnt an effigy of Mehdi 
Ali in the car park and the 
speed bumps (loathed by 
employees) had the names 
of the executives and Irving 
Gould painted on them. 
Haynie's 'Deathbed Vigil' video 
came with credits and captions 
edited on an Amiga, of course.
Just two months later, Jay Miner 
succumbed to the kidney problems that 
had plagued his life and died on 20 June 
1994 at the age of 62. In an obituary 
article in Amazing Computing magazine 
(September 1994), commenting on the 
sad fact that Jay lived long enough to 
see the machine he had done so much 
to create come to grief, his former ceo 
and Amiga Corp. co-founder Dave 
Morse was quoted as saying: 'When 
Commodore acquired Amiga in 1984, 
the legion of Amiga loyalists thought the 
world would beat a path to the better-
mousetrap door. It didn't happen. The 
Amiga languished.'
The bidding process for the bankrupt 
remains of Commodore was long and 
convoluted. Commodore UK proposed 
a management buy-out, keeping in place 
many of the same structures. In the same 
issue of Amazing Computing, when asked 
if he was heading up a Commodore 
management group to purchase 
Commodore and the Amiga technology 
David Pleasance put a brave face on it. 
'Unfortunately nothing is certain. At the 
end of the day, we are very confident that 
our bid will succeed but it is really in the 
hands of the liquidators and the creditors.'
Pleasance made it clear that his eye 
was on the Amiga as a machine, not 
just Commodore. 'Everybody else is 
just bidding for the Amiga technology 
to apply to products they want to do 
themselves. This has no bearing on the 
"When Commodore acquired Amiga in 1984, the 
legion of Amiga loyalists thought the world would 
beat a path to the better-mousetrap door.
It didn't happen."
Captions from Dave 
Haynie's 'Deathbed Vigil' 
video documenting the 
final days of Commodore 
- edited on an Amiga 
- included a moving 
epitaph for Jay Miner.

Amiga and it is not a healthy situation.'
It was also clear that the contempt 
felt for the West Chester 
management had not been 
confined to the engineering 
staff working there but 
extended to the UK arm 
too, as Pleasance said in 
the same interview. 'Commodore was 
messed up big time by the president who 
had no understanding of the market and 
totally ignored all the advice he received 
from his general managers all around the 
world.'
German pc manufacturer Escom 
emerged as a contender, with former 
Commodore Germany staff joining its 
ranks and by acquiring the rights to 
the Commodore logo (the stylised C= 
known as 'chicken-lips' in Germany). 
Almost a year after the process 
started, Escom won the bidding above 
Commodore UK's David Pleasance. It 
was promising to resume production 
and bring forward new models 
(including the long-awaited 
Hombre CD64 machines 
equipped with the Hombre risc 
chipset, another cancelled project 
at West Chester). Escom also 
invested heavily in retail outlets, 
buying up the failed electrical 
appliance chain Rumbelows in 
the UK. Commodore-branded 
PC accessories were the first sign 
of life. 
With Escom expanding too 
rapidly and losing 185 million 
Deutschmarks in that year, the company 
went bankrupt in July 1996 and the 
Commodore assets were sold on. First 
Dutch company Tulip Computers and 
then America's Gateway took on the 
Amiga. The operating system, now 
known as Amigaos, became a separate 
entity offered for other machines.

bring up millions of hits, everything 
from screenshots to videos, forums to 
new games.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Obviously this is all very pre-Internet, 
but some people were getting hold of 
the latest pd productions from bulletin 
boards through dial-up connections on 
what by today's standards were incredibly 
slow connections with modems (and 
phone couplers in some cases). This 
required a bit of patience to download 
disks - an 880k disk downloaded 
over such connections in the kind of 
timeframe gigabytes of data does on the 
average broadband connections of today. 
For many people it was far more viable 
to get the disks posted out to you or pick 
them up at a local computer fair.
Piracy may have been a huge 
problem for the application and games 
companies, but pd distracted from that, 
to an extent, and offered a wide range 
of software to try out on your machine. 
It was a rather unique and incredibly 
important way to get software to end 
users for users developing things that 
had little or no commercial value - and 
an outlet for commercial developers to 
get demos of their work out into the 
community if they couldn't secure a 
slot on the all-important coverdisks on 
P
D or Public Domain software 
which is often referred to more 
recently and more accurately as freeware 
(rather than open source which is a 
different kettle of fish entirely) was a 
key part of the culture surrounding the 
Amiga platform from its rise in the 
UK and Europe. The pd scene included 
productions and applications that fell 
under several descriptions: freeware, 
shareware, licenseware, and various 
variations including the joys of giftware 
(where the author asked for a present to 
be posted to them).
The pd phenomenon arose from 
earlier days on the C64 and other 
formats, after distribution of software by 
listings you typed in became ridiculous. 
However it was with the generation of 
machines with 3.5-inch floppy disks 
that things really took off - the fact that 
you could literally write an address on 
a floppy disk label and pop on a stamp 
and nine times out of ten it would get to 
the recipient in a fully functional state 
certainly helped. Fortunately though 
most pd libraries had the foresight to 
buy padded envelopes, or slim boxes.

Final Frontier diskzine and Holodeck slideshows and a 
columnist in Micro (Computer) Mart from 1999 to the 
magazine's closure in December 2016. Here he looks at 
Public Domain and Shareware on the Amiga.

magazines such as Amiga Format, CU 
Amiga and Amiga User International. 
In fact one of the earliest memories 
for many of the pd dynamic was the 
rolling demo of Shadow Of The Beast 
(1989) that wowed people in computer 
shops up and down the country and 
encouraged the purchase of packs of 
floppy disks - after all the disk could 
copy itself!
The rise of pd, especially on the 
Amiga, was pretty much down to the 
demoscene (see the following sections). It 
was at demoparties and swap parties that 
the culture of swapping your own work 
around took off (alongside casual piracy 
in almost every case), and megademos, 
as they were known, 
grew out of the fierce 
competition between 
groups producing 
cracktros, (demo intros 
on the bootblock of a 
cracked game). In time 
the very tools used by the 
demo crews would become 
some of the most purchased 
pd disks, along with the 
demos that everyone wanted 
and shared with their friends, if only to 
exclaim 'let's see an ST do this!' 
Demo productions such as the 
Budbrain Megademo, Enigma (by 
Phenomena), The Red Sector Megademo 
and its follow up, Cebit '90, State Of 
The Art (by Spaceballs) and Jesus On Es 
(by LSD), to name but a very very few,

29 November 1992.
with Amiga owners ordering disks by 
mail order to try out new productions 
they couldn't get locally. However the 
independent computer and game retailers 
that dabbled in the top pd productions 
soon found that running scene demos in 
their shops not only sold the floppies with 
the software on them, but the machines 
they were running on too.
The demos World Of Commodore 
Amiga '92 (By Sanity) and even more 
so, Point Of Sale (by Digital) were 
the perfect illustration of this with 
Commodore specifically leveraging 
the demoscene to sell Amiga home 
computers. Scene demos sold machines, 
as I can personally attest to after using 
some to sell Amiga 500 Screen Gems 
packs in 1990/91. Of course pd included 
hundreds of games including 'classic 
titles' as Mortal Kumquat III, Tobias 
Richter's Star Trek, and Deluxe Galaga.
Possibly the most public way that the 
pd scene exerted itself into the public 
consciousness, however, was at computer 
fairs. In the pre-Internet purchasing days, 
it was the computer fairs that were a 
draw for those looking for bargains or the 
latest technology that hadn't reached the 
independent retailers yet, with local fairs 
taking place at weekends usually at least 

cultural phenomenon. This is probably 
down to the fact that the tools provided 
via pd libraries were what allowed 
Amiga owners to create, and in many 
cases produce software that would go 
back to the pd companies and enter 
the library too. The most famous and 
memorable pieces of software that got 
distributed this way were probably 
the Red Sector DemoMaker and the 
soundtrackers, both of which would also 
eventually make it onto Amiga magazine 
cover disks. The only slight problem was 
that neither of these were actually pd!
The Red Sector DemoMaker as 
produced by TCC designs and Red 
once a month. An example of this was 
the All Formats Computer Fairs, which 
regularly used the National Motorcycle 
Museum by the nec. A small pd library 
called Cynostic PD, based in Coventry, 
had a couple of tables at the event with 
a bank of Amiga machines running 
X-Copy to produce the various disks in 
the library on demand for the punters. 
Of course, as fans of the Amiga, it was 
also a place to set up machines with big 
televisions and a sound system and show 
the owners of other machines what the 
platform could do with scene demos - 
much to the joy of those in attendance 
selling Amiga machines. This was a scene 
repeated up and down the country and 
for those not in the demoscene itself, 
it was the fairs that were their place to 
celebrate the community around their 
machine of choice.
Though the demoscene and pd are 
inextricably linked, the memories of 
the classic Amiga as a platform usually 
segregate the demoscene as a separate

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Offering disks from as little as 75p 
plus postage, the pd libraries offered a 
plethora of software to those not able 
to go on-line quite yet. All this software 
was available on demand, with no actual 
stockholding required, bar a set of master 
disks and blanks to copy onto, with cash 
and cheques being sent through the post, 
or a pile of disks coming back from a 
computer fair. It's fair to say there were 
a few less than honourable pd libraries 
that also pirated software (like Red 
Sector DemoMaker and other commercial 
games and applications) but in the main 
they were a great addition to the Amiga 
market.
Some of the pd libraries also 
fostered relations with the demoscene 
itself, and none more famously than 
17-Bit Software. Keeping tabs on the 
demoscene paid off for 17-Bit when 
after growing out of the Microbyte 
computer shop chain, a development 
team called Team 7 approached 17-Bit 
regarding their beat-'em-up game in 
development. As a result of that the 
team and the company combined to 
form Team 17 to release Full Contact, 
recruiting musician Allister Brimble 
and members of the demoscene in the 
process to produce further games. The 
17-bit library of disks was put on 
cd-rom by Almathera. The rest, as they 
say, is history.
Sector was actually a commercial product 
released by Data Becker of Germany 
(it actually came as a disk within a 
hardback manual that was sold as a book 
officially). Unfortunately many of the 
more unscrupulous pd libraries copied 
and sold the disk as pd even after it was 
pointed out it was in fact commercial. The 
software actually ended up on the disk 
#18 of the cover mounts on CU Amiga.
Karsten Obarski's Ultimate 
Soundtracker (disc ST-00) and the 
various sample disks that went with it 
(ST-01 onwards) proved to be far more 
popular than other music production 
methods for the machine. Soundtracker 
(for short) was actually a commercial 
release, but after poor reviews and bugs 
coming to light, the software was cloned 
to produce Noisetracker, and potentially 
more famously, Protracker. It was via 
the AM/FM disk magazine, from Bjorn 
Opposite page: 
Megademo by Red 
Sector Inc. - released 
in September 1989.
The PD libraries

Lynne, that Protracker came more to the 
public consciousness as the 3.1b version 
of the program formed part of the AM/
FM licenseware release schedule as the 
third 'special' disk release and then, a 
little later, on the PD-DIY coverdisk on 
Amiga Format.
Music trackers combined with Deluxe 
Paint, (a version of which came with 
almost every Amiga sold in the UK and 
Europe), DemoMaker, learning to code 
directly, or using amos or Blitz Basic 
were just some of the many ways that 
Amiga enthusiasts were inspired towards 
creativity.
Disk series such as the Fred Fish 
disks, full of 'crunched' utilities, provided 
the software to allow a bootblock, or 
AmigaOS startup-sequence to trigger 
animations and music, and the Assassins 
game disk series for inspiration. All 
of this combined in the production of 
amateur software left, right and centre, 
from slideshows with music, to music 
disks, to disk magazines to basic games.
This is where an awful lot of the 
second and third (post 8-bit) generation 
of British coders, graphic artists and 
musicians came from to go on to make 
later Amiga titles, and then move onto 
the PlayStation generation. You probably 
wouldn't have had the likes of Pinball 
Dreams, WipEout, Battlefield and Little 
Big Planet without it.

AM/FM was a disk-magazine that 
was distributed as licenseware using a 
rather clever method. Bjorn Lynne aka 
Dr Awesome, who produced the mag, 
sold disk labels to the licensed resellers 
such as 17-bit Software, with the labels 
denoting these were officially sold copies 
of the magazine. This continued with 
the first release of Protracker 3.1b, which 
was an official AM/FM release with 
money going back to Cryptoburners, the 
programmers.

adopted for the releases of The Final

other releases from UK based Infinite

all played a part, as the creativity 
of computing seemed to disappear. 
With the Amiga specifically, dial-up 
connections were getting faster and 
technologies such as leased lines, adsl 
and fibre broadband were becoming 
tangible options as the internet took 
root.
The distribution of hundreds of disks 
worth of software on cd-roms for the 
CD-TV and other cd-rom equipped 
Amiga machines made buying software 
on floppy disks seem rather clunky, 
especially as AmiNet, the online Amiga 
software repository, was gaining in 
popularity, as downloading adfs (Amiga 
Disk Files) and other crunched forms of 
software gained traction.
Over time what was the pd 
movement on the Amiga and other 
computers of the late 1980s and early 
1990s simply morphed into the open 
source movement of today.

Busby quickly became my No.1 go-to 
for games. I soon found out where his 
illegitimate loot came from and what 
made it different from any spoils of 
piracy I'd enjoyed before.
Busby liked to show off. He made 
a point of having something you didn't 
before giving it to you regardless. One 
particular visit he had some titles I'd 
never heard of, a handful of US imports 
- games like Chilly Willy and Phantom 
Karate. But what really caught my eye 
were the on-screen 'tags' of the guy who 
had first made the copy from the original 
cassette or disk emblazoned on the title 
screen - 'Broken By Black Bob, F++K 
Copyright'. How this guy set the game 
free from the confines of the commercial 
ecosystem seemed more important to 
me at that moment than the game itself. 
What was I seeing? My first crack intro! 
I was standing on the edge of the rabbit 
hole, and about to take the red pill.
The demoscene originated in the 
early world of piracy: crack intros found 
themselves detached from the illegal

technology course where I met a geek 
we called 'Prof'. Like me, he owned a 
Commodore 64, and also like me he'd 
been a school playground pirate. We 
lived only a couple of miles apart and 
one day I met a close neighbour of his. 
This guy - let's call him Busby - was old,  
at least as old as forty seemed to one 
aged seventeen.
To an impressionable lad, Busby 
seemed extraordinary: an unemployed 
middle-aged software pirate driving 
an old car, with an aura of secrecy, who 
never gave a straight answer to any 
question. He copied pirated C64 games 
Anarchy and the Demoscene
In the early 1990s Anarchy set out to rule the Amiga 
demoscene. The team created some of the most hardware 
stretching and innovative demos. Here, founder and 
organiser Judge Drokk - aka Mark Hellewell - recounts 
the story which starts with school-playground piracy.

quickly thrown together moniker Judge 
Drokk) and my group. I craved adulation 
from those above and those below who 
were just starting to discover the scene.
This happened close to the end of the 
Commodore 64's life, though for me it 
was less of an ending than a beginning, 
this time with eyes wide open, armed 
with knowledge, sensibility, the wisdom 
of age and, more importantly, with a new 
group. 'Hello Amiga, I'm Judge Drokk,' I 
announced. 'And we're Anarchy.' 
Same game, bigger pitch
It was 1989, and in its first month 
Anarchy was a group of four, but we 
picked up some new friends, and with 
friends came software and my first 
experience of the Amiga's flavour of 
demo. The name of the demo escapes 
me, as does the group responsible 
for its creation, but what I saw didn't 
exactly impress. I was anticipating 
the demoscene's answer to the official 
bouncing ball promo. I was expecting 
life of their own. The mid-1980s onwards 
became a Renaissance period for the 
phenomenon. My personal experience 
started as an addiction, became an 
obsession, and led to a way of life.
Moving up to Amiga
Being drip-fed new software like a 
junkie from a dealer was soon to become 
a thing of the past. I was growing up 
and discovering the scene on my own 
feet. I interacted with the scene through 
'trading' - posting packages of cracked 
protection-stripped games (still for the 
C64), while sharing a pen pal-style letter 
with every package containing news of 
the day, both of my own and what others 
had told me via the same method. This 
simple form of communication - trading 
- meant everyone was connected.
News travelled slowly, at least on 
paper. Fanzines soon followed, such as 
Illegal, produced by Jeff Smart of seminal 
cracking collective Triad, and Iguana, 
edited by a guy who called himself 
No Original Software Available Here 
(nosah) of the Doughnut Cracking 
Service. His scene obsession rubbed off 
on me. I was fired by his drive and that 
led me to form my own C64 group. 
I had enough talented friends to pull 
into a collective creative unit and The 
Infiltrators was born in 1987.
I learned fast about how the scene 
worked, while making friends with 
various respected demo and cracker 
groups. But at the time I could only 
think of promoting my name (the

demoscene was everything. However, 
we were still new and pretty much 
undiscovered beyond our own address 
books. At this time my own address 
book was gradually filling with names 
beyond my own team, although when 
you're new the big guys don't want to 
play with you, so you play with your 
current contemporaries...or worse. One 
such 'worse' team had just picked up a 
coder new to the Amiga called Kreator. I 
intervened. We got our first break.
I stole Kreator from his nest 
because I saw him as a threat to my 
own fledgling Anarchy group. Kreator 
changed Anarchy. Two small one-part 
demos proved he could code. He could 
do what others were doing, and just as 
well, and more importantly he was doing 
it better than we had done it before. Beat 
to hear Rob Hubbard, Matt Gray and 
Martin Galway being given their P60s 
on the spot. What I got was screeching 
horn samples and panpipes, and a visual 
accompaniment that complemented the 
tune...perfectly!
Hammer, our only coder at this 
time, a friend from our C64 group, was 
putting together his first Amiga intro. 
We were taking baby steps, but we were 
proud of our first. It slipped out quietly. 
Maybe nobody even noticed it. Our 
reputation was intact. Reputation in the 
Anarchy team members

back, and Mystic on tte

name in the middle.

from the Sheffield and Rotherham areas. 
Of British Amiga demoscene musicians 
only one stood out. His name was 4-Mat 
and he was in Slipstream. As a fellow 
southerner Mole knew him. We made 
the approach and 4-Mat joined Anarchy.
The creation, growth and continued 
success of a demo team is reliant on 
finding, building and mixing a team of 
talented individuals who fan the creative 
flames of each other's work during a 
process that ultimately involves many 
man-hours of intensive but pleasurable 
labour. There was no healthy paycheque 
for this work. Adulation, admiration 
and, in some cases, a little envy was the 
reward for a completed demo presented 
to Amigadom. Kreator's numerically 
titled First Demo, released at what would 
be Anarchy's first visit to a British demo 
party, was about to tick all those boxes.
Magnetic Fields hosted the 'copy 
party' in the cold early months of 1990 
in a South Yorkshire town. It was a 
revelation on many levels. I'd read reports 
of parties in hacking scene fanzines, 
large halls, hundreds of people, a kind 
of computer-led version of the popular 
underground acid raves of the late 1980s 
and early 90s. This was a little different. 
It was held in a normal terraced house 
on a normal street on the outskirts of 
a normal town. Fifty to sixty visitors 
attended and over the next day and a 
half we got to bond with other teams.
Sofas were removed from the living 
room to make space for more standing 
bodies. Probably no more than two 
yourself, and if you're good enough you'll 
beat the others too. 
Scream if you wanna go faster
Goodbye to the 1980s. It was the 
decade that matured us, shaping us into 
the people we were in 1990. The team 
expanded quickly, and a group needs 
connections within the demoscene as a 
whole. The best way to achieve this was 
through mail traders. Scene pressure took 
its toll on two of the three fresh faces 
from the south of England who filled 
this role for Anarchy, but Mole took up 
the slack to become a true trading hero.

teams in 1990 Slipstream and Magnetic 
Fields were two outstanding names.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Fuelled by winning at the Magnetic 
Fields party and driven by exciting 
European competition, Kreator and 
4-Mat began work on a new production. 
Kreator's music collection inspired 
Phantasmagoria, a labour of pure 
orchestrated love: a three-part demo 
with an unending filled-vector finale. 
Pretty much nobody in Britain was 
doing 3D filled vectors. Scoopex and 
Red Sector hadn't done them this well 
before. The epic tune by 4-MAT was 
perfectly synchronised with the exciting 
on-screen action, the two working hand-
in-hand perfectly. Twenty-five years later 
random quotes from nostalgic forums 
spell it better than I ever could: '4-Mat's 
music is one of the best ever,' and 'I never 
saw 3D-vectors that were calculated that 
correctly before Phantasmagoria.'
Amigas were set up downstairs where 
the latest cracked games constantly 
played. Sleeping conditions were basic -
later that evening a guy stepping over me 
woke me up. He wore a badge denoting 
his scene name: Lee of Oracle. This took 
me right back to the first sighting of a 
cracked game and an on-screen tag left 
by the culprit. Now, a year later one of 
them was climbing over me in the dark, 
trying to find the bloody loo!
Hammer, Mr Big and myself attended 
as Anarchy representatives, pockets 
stuffed with blank 3.5-inch disks and two 
containing our entries into what would be 
the group's first competitive output...and 
we walked off with the demo and music 
prizes. Anarchy had just arrived on the 
scene. Suddenly everyone wanted to be 
in Anarchy. Success drove growth at a 
speed I could never have predicted.

If we were moving fast, so was the 
competition. We may have won a slice, 
but the double whammy of Scoopex's 
Mental Hangover and the Red Sector 
Megademo put things back into 
perspective. I felt the British demoscene 
just wasn't trying. 'That'll do, it's good 
enough,' summed it up with a shrug.
Since stills of Amiga 
demos don't really 
do them justice, it's 
probably best simply 
to admire the titles: 
Scoopex's Mental 
Hangover and Red 
Sector's Megademo.

Dutch artist Facet, along with English 
scene devotees Banger, Kris, and an 
undiscovered musical talent called Nuke, 
a guy from the north of England who was 
new to the scene and filled with untapped 
musicality.
While our British membership 
remained fairly static Europe was rich 
with frenzied talent and between 1991 
and late 1992 Anarchy became a magnet 
for upcoming and established gifted 
individuals. As the membership grew 
the output soared. Hardly 
a week passed without 
something new appearing 
bearing the Anarchy 
motif. It was almost total 
saturation of the scene. This came to 
a head with two complete rival group 
divisions becoming part of Anarchy. The 
Silents of Denmark (including 'Sunjohn' 
who was the famous coder of the epic 
Silents production Global Trash) along 
with all of the Silents French membership.
A thousand things made Anarchy 
one of the most exciting times of my life 
and a handful made it one of the worst, 
Thanks to Kreator and 4-Mat we 
won our second demo party competition, 
decimated the British demoscene, and 
took on the giants of Europe. It was time 
to measure up for the crown. At this point 
we were little more than half way through 
1990 and Anarchy was rapidly becoming 
a top contender. Why stop there?
Mole - Anarchy's very own socialite 
- exploited his address book further, 
introducing me to stylish and exciting 
programmer Dan Scott, a member of 
Slipstream. Dan, it turned 
out, had itchy feet. I 
scratched them. Welcome 
to Anarchy. At about this 
time I received a letter from 
Sweden that would change the size and 
weight of our group overnight. Teeze and 
his band of Swedish Amiga devotees, 
recently separated from their own group, 
promised to give us all their energy if we 
took them under our wing. This swelled 
Anarchy's ranks by at least ten, with 
Teeze controlling his members in Sweden 
and control of Teeze down to me. A few 
more joined us: the wonderfully talented

4-MAT. It also spawned the idea of 
holding our own party.
The first we called The Anarchy 
Winter Conference 1991. Mr Big 
booked a venue near his home, a school, 
most likely for his own convenience. It's 
not known whether he investigated the 
premises' suitability, but what followed 
was a disaster. The power supply tripped 
almost as rapidly as a drunken clown 
with his shoelaces tied together. Holding 
an Amiga demoparty for hundreds of 
fee-paying guests who lost their work 
and their patience every ten minutes was 
akin to being put into shark-infested 
waters with a collapsing safety cage!
Our second we called Party! 92, which 
took place on 4 April 1992. I used my 
local knowledge to find a suitable venue 
with easy access from the motorway, 
robust power supply, good parking, tables, 
a stage and, most importantly...a bar! 
After the near disaster of the previous 
year we were unsure how many would 
take a chance on our follow up, although 
even I was surprised when we sold out the 
particularly Hammer. His  latest work 
was not up to scratch. It was like looking 
back at 1989, if not worse. I had to let 
him go. Hammer was a proper friend 
from the C64 days and I was giving him 
the long walk.
Let's Party! 
No matter how many friends you had 
in other groups or your own, the fact 
was that most of the time few in the 
scene ever got to meet - unless like 
Kreator and Raistlin of Anarchy, they 
were brothers - except at the Computer 
Entertainment Show or the Personal 
Computer World show in London. 
Realising we got on so well at those, 
many of us spent a week at the house 
of our artistic member Mystik while his 
parents were away. It became known 
as our Internal Party, and spawned the 
neat demo The Fury, produced upstairs 
by Kreator and Mystik, with music by 
Banger, Mystik, Judge 
Drokk, Mr Big and 
Kreator at the Anarchy 
'Internal Party'.

to let him go...'

The biggest party in the world 
outside of the UK had taken place 
the year before in Aars, Denmark, a 
cooperation between Cristal:Silents and 
Anarchy. A staggering 1,252 people 
attended. The party was mostly scouted 
and organised by Trix of Anarchy. A 
huge number of entries - twenty-six 
in total - were submitted for the main 
demo competition. And then in the 
following year The Party! 92: The Final 
completely overshadowed 1991's success, 
once again organised by Cristal:Silents 
and Anarchy. A mind blowing 
2,500 attendees made this the 
largest and most successful 
demoparty in the whole world 
at this time, and it became 
a forerunner of the annual 
Assembly Party that takes place every 
Summer in Finland.
Read all about it!
The demoscene was a wonderfully well-
connected entity. A global collective in 
which varying means of communication 
venue in just a couple of weeks and with 
months still to go. Party! 92 became the 
largest attended event in England at that 
time, even gaining early promotion in a 
popular Commodore magazine a month 
before.
We tried something not done before 
in the UK, namely sponsorship. The 
demoscene has always had an uneasy 
relationship with public domain software 
providers. They were either largely 
ignored or hated. Some of the less 
scrupulous even lured enthusiastic mail-
traders to back up their entire collections 
for them as an easy boost to their pd 
stock, promising a healthy cheque as a 
reward...that no one ever received.
Thinking that the UK's biggest 
pd supplier might like to redress the 
balance, we approached Wakefield's 
17-Bit Software and they sponsored 
Party! 92. Truth be told, success 
was mixed. One rule for all demo 
competition entries was they had 
to feature a statement that their 
submissions would be distributed 
exclusively by 17-Bit. Two days after 
the party most groups re-released their 
entries with the aforementioned message 
removed. You can't win them all.
Reviews were generally positive and 
demoscener Mick Dagger of NightShift 
Productions filmed the party. Partygoers 
from all over ordered vhs copies. 
Many hundreds were sold and shipped 
worldwide to customers. It remains to 
this day the most popular party footage 
of the British Amiga demo scene.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Disks were so much easier to 
produce, duplicate and distribute than 
paper magazines, but Stolen Data had 
a rocky ride in its first couple of years. 
Now a disk-only magazine, it required a 
vastly increased level of content, but the 
editorial styles of Anarchy members Kris 
and Mr Big lacked somewhat and Stolen 
Data suffered as a result. After Mr Big 
left the scene after Party! 92, I took over 
the editor's role.
I relished the challenge of breathing 
new life into the magazine and 
together with Kreator's coding talent 
and design ideas we built a whole new 
Stolen Data. The hottest coders, artists 
and musicians only made up a small 
proportion of the scene. I wanted to 
mine untapped resources. I wanted to 
discover passionate individuals who 
yearned to find a way in and had the 
skills to achieve their goal - and they 
were out there, individuals unable to 
break into the scene through more 
traditional methods, who wanted to gain 
recognition for their skills. I named them 
the Stolen Data Team.
Together with Anarchy firecracker 
Trix, who took on a greater editorial role, 
the new magazine was reinvigorated and 
expanded to two disks packed to the 
gills. The first contained the magazine, 
the second featured reader submissions 
in the form of an Art Gallery, a Music 
Jukebox and the scene charts, with our 
self-chosen Top-10s of the month. 
CU Amiga Magazine described our new-
look as 'the future of magazines'. 
joined everyone. It was a major feat 
considering the limited technology 
available to the common man of the time.
When you needed reliable 
information rather than word of mouth 
scene magazines 
were the place to 
find it. My old 
friend nosah 
enjoyed great 
success in 1988 
with his bi-monthly 
Iguana. His new 
idea was a disk-
and-paper magazine 
- he wanted a 
text-lite cover 
disk to accompany 
each issue of the 
magazine. My ideas 
for calling it Double Barelled or Shotgun 
were overturned by nosah's Stolen Data 
- very apt! Sadly, real-life problems 
arose from nosah's employer, the British 
Army, which ordered him to quit the 
scene or the Army. The print magazine 
did not survive without him, but the disk 
version was to flourish, despite a few 
missteps along the way.

ways. We'd both been around a while. 
We were truly international teams, even 
working together on the world's biggest 
international demo parties at the time. 
Then they teamed up with Crionics 
to create the ground-breaking demo 
Hardwired, which inevitably pushed 
them to No.1 once again in July. 
But Anarchy was gaining 
momentum. On a day-by-day basis 
our relentless release schedule was as 
staggering as it was overwhelming. It 
was then when the French membership 
of The Silents asked to join the ranks 
of Anarchy. The snowball suddenly 
became an avalanche. Number one was 
inevitable. In September 1992 Anarchy 
was crowned the No.1 demo group in 
the world. It was amazing, elating, and 
yet it left a weirdly empty feeling. Where 
do you go now you're at the top?
Simple: jump off.
It was 1993. Winter was coming to 
I was tickled pink to say the least. From 
bottom of the popularity stakes to better 
than half way to the top in just one issue; 
a top three after three issues.
Unfortunately there wasn't enough 
time left to take it right to the top. 
The tides were changing, the sky was 
darkening, but not at least until Anarchy 
had taken the world.
At the summit...and the fall
Managing a demoscene group was 
similar to managing a pop group. In 
place of every album we delivered a 
demo, and every intro was our latest 
single...and there was the Eurochart.
Votes were collected worldwide, 
compiled and results distributed in a 
polished digital rundown of the best in 
the demoscene by Scandinavian demo 
team The Crusaders, and later Static 
Bytes. With eleven categories and 
twenty places in each was there room for 
everybody? Not a chance in hell!
Anarchy was No.2 in the Top 20 
Best Groups category in the January 
1992 chart and the Silents occupied 
the top spot. You had to love 'em. We 
were quite like each other in many

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Within days I had swiftly ended 
Anarchy and completely disassociated 
myself from the scene by selling my 
Amiga. With that my demoscene days 
were done. This may seem like sudden 
death, but that is exactly as it happened.
The retrospective Amiga demoscene 
site ExoticA.org wrote: 'Anarchy spent 
some time as the definitive "super-group" 
of the demoscene, before it grew too big 
and simply died. When they were on top, 
though, they produced what are some 
of the best-remembered demos ever.' I 
would be happy to see that engraved as 
an epitaph on the group's gravestone.
Maybe it took place just in time? 
After all the Amiga's free-fall into 
oblivion was not far off. How long the 
news took to disseminate throughout the 
membership and for them to move on 
I never knew. Kreator, 4-Mat, Mystik, 
Kris, Del and Mole ended their scene 
life along with me. We had climbed out 
of the rabbit hole and back into the real 
world. The story was over. 
 
Aftermath
 Dan Scott and later Martin Iveson 
(Dan and Nuke) worked in-house 
for Core Design on hit titles such as 
Heimdall,  Chuck Rock, CarVup and 
many more. Derek Leigh Gilchrist 
(Del) worked for Codemasters during 
his tenure at Anarchy, and has since 
worked on scores of titles including 
the original Tomb Raider and its first 
sequels. Mathew Simmonds (4-Mat) 
raised a few eyebrows at Core when he 
an end. It had been a busy few months. 
I was tucked away putting together #10 
of Stolen Data. I didn't know it would be 
the last. The Stolen Data Team, together 
with the help and creative input of Trix 
and new code and design by Kreator, was 
proving a great success. What a shame 
there was never an eleventh issue. Oh 
how the headlines would have read if 
I'd been around to write them myself. 
Treachery, backstabbing, betrayal - those 
are just the nice ones. 'Mutiny rips apart 
world's number one Amiga demoscene 
group. Founder pulls plug.' 
The story behind the headline that 
never was reads: 'Dan and Nuke, who 
became the cosiest pair in Anarchy while 
working together at renowned game 
studio Core Design, conspired with 
Dutch Anarchy artist Facet along with 
everyone they had recently worked with 
in Anarchy to take a leap of faith and join 
them in a new team. A case of 'nice group, 
we'll take it, just don't tell the boss'.
They didn't. No call, no letter, 
nothing. I never spoke to them again. 
"When they were on top they produced 
some of the best-remembered demos ever."

shame then, in some ways that a chance 
to turn Anarchy into a game studio by 
itself came a little late.
Around the middle of 1993 software 
publisher Black Legend invited me 
to project manage a team to develop 
a new Amiga game. It already had a 
name - Fatman: the Caped Consumer. But 
Anarchy had passed, everyone already 
had a job, and some people I no longer 
wanted to talk to. I declined the offer 
and never mentioned it to any previous 
members of Anarchy, or in fact anyone. 
The game was eventually completed, 
published and released. It turned out 
to be a playable if somewhat average 
superhero platform game. What might 
have been if certain paths of destiny 
had been laid in altogether different 
directions is anyone's guess. It's probably 
wise not to ponder the question.
created the tunes for Chuck Rock and 
CarVup - once the games were published 
everyone in the know realised they had 
been written for two previously released 
Anarchy demos. Mat wrote soundtracks 
for games as diverse as Dizzy: Prince of 
the Yolk-Folk and Silent Hill: Shattered 
Memories. Dan also caused a stir at Core 
when he wrote an intro for one of the 
most notorious cracking groups of the 
time, Skid Row. He soundtracked his 
code with what was to become one of 
4-MAT's most iconic chip-style tunes, 
the wonderfully melodic LFF. The 
resulting intro was used on the front of 
the cracked version of the Psygnosis/
DMA Design mega selling Lemmings. 
Dan even signed the intro 'Dan of 
Anarchy', visible on screen throughout 
the intro.
Jussi Pietilä (Bruno) from Finland 
later went on to work with Maniacs of 
Noise, and sadly passed away in 2008. 
Martin Iveson (Nuke) is now a music 
producer, and DJ. Kreator's brother 
Raistlin (Robert Troughton) is MD of 
Coconut Lizard Studio, and previously 
UK general manager of Epic Games 
(Gears of War), co-formed successful 
studio Pitbull Syndicate and also 
managed a team that worked on Unreal 
Engine 4, and has a cv sprinkled with 
game titles worthy of name dropping 
such as Destruction Derby, Demolition 
Racer, Wheelman, Test Drive 4, 5, 6 
and more. If Anarchy were a single 
development team I couldn't possibly 
think of one that could compare. It's a 
Anarchy's final logo, 
an elegant epitaph.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
cracking and swapping continue? 
In January 1989, we released our 
first demo with coding by Crazy Typer 
and graphics by J.O.E., promising a 
new generation in software piracy and 
a row of high quality productions. The 
prophecy would turn into reality before 
the end of the year.
But we had a big problem: having a 
new name erased all previous reputation. 
To build an international reputation 
from nothing required someone with 
contacts and a strong will to succeed. 
This person was Ranger of Scoopex.
'In the early years Ranger's word was 
always the law, the only two members to 
ever influence his decisions were Shark 
the Master and Slayer', recalls TMB, one 
of Scoopex's members. 'Members always 
joked saying Scoopex was not a group 
but a religion and Ranger its divine 
leader - I think it was the member 
Reward who came up with the term 
Rangerism!
'Ranger's allies were mostly the 
Subway/Spreadpoint members and 
Irata/(T)RSI. He liked to start wars 
with everyone who said something bad 
S
coopex was born in Austria in 
tumultuous times for video games. 
All hell was breaking loose in Germany. 
Police had just clamped down on piracy 
and one of the C-64/Amiga groups 
targeted was Megaforce. Coming from 
Megaforce, Ranger and Shark the Master 
founded the group under the new name 
we know today, Scoopex. Would it 
become a pure demoscene group to evade 
the long arm of the law, or would the 
Scoopex and the Demoscene
Photon, organiser of Scoopex, shares the group's 
fascinating story - from cracking games to being a force in 
the demoscene. From 1989 until today Scoopex has been 
an essential part of the Amiga's history.
Scoopex has had quite 
a few ocs firsts. Mental 
Hangover was the 
first trackmo. Make 
a statement, change 
the scene. From then 
on, all groups made 
continuous, track-loaded 
demos to win compos.

The formation of Scoopex Sweden 
also took place in this year, although it 
was unfortunately brief, with just the one 
demo release - B.I.G. featuring members 
Jesus and Merriam and Uncle Tom. 
He had already contributed to Scoopex 
and sae in our Megademo, but he would 
come back again and again as a star of 
Scoopex.
Despite the little-known Megademo 2 
and Glory Stars 2, it has to be said that 
1990 was the year that belonged to 
about the group (I guess we all did).
But official conflicts were only short-
lived for a few groups like World of 
Wonders, Paranoimia, and Storm - the 
competition, if you will.'
Today, members might not respond 
favourably to commandments from 
above, but at the time, it yielded results.
With pack disks, intros and cracks 
coming out at a rapid pace, the group 
quickly expanded beyond Austria's 
borders. The first countries to get 
Scoopex divisions were the UK, Sweden, 
and Finland. The expansion started in 
England, with a group called Share and 
Enjoy (sae). This group had already 
collaborated with Megaforce on intros 
and on the first Amazing Tunes music 
disk, had a pack disk series of its own, 
and had members that would go on to 
form Anarchy.
In continental Europe, Scoopex was 
starting to establish itself through their 
excellent pack disks - the Rangerpacks - 
perhaps the go-to completist collection 
of demos released in Europe at the 
time. But with the Scoopex and sae 
Megademo, Scoopex was not only 
established with crack intros, but also 
pure demoscene releases as well.
Photon adds: 'At that time in 1989, 
it was seeing the Glory Stars demo 
in person at the Digitech Summer 
Conference that caught my attention 
and alerted me to the greatness of 
Scoopex. Even though it wasn't a major 
release, something about it made me 
stop and look and listen.'

busiest year in Amiga history), and with 
the Slayerpacks continuing alongside the 
now high-numbered Rangerpacks, this 
solidly engraved the Scoopex name in 
the roster of major Amiga groups.
At perhaps the height of the Amiga 
500 scene, with the wind in the sails 
from Scoopex Austria and Scoopex UK, 
Slayer, Reward, and Uncle Tom had 
climbed to the pinnacle of the charts of 
the demoscene.
Photon on joining Scoopex: 'In 1989 
I joined Phenomena just after their 
megademo, and I was very busy and 
happy. Why did I leave for Scoopex? 
Well, I think it's about friends and 
contacts. Friends left for Real Life™, 
the group got new blood, and I started 
visiting Firefox, Uncle Tom, Uno and 
Judas. I still remember the good times I 
had with the Scoopex and Phenomena 
members.
'Uno was a fan of Reward and had 
made contact with Scoopex Finland, and 
I was a fan of Slayer - while wanting to 
beat him to a pulp, naturally, as things 
were in those days - and late-night 
phone calls ensued.
'I was shown a crack intro by Slayer 
featuring a corkscrew scroller, and 
knowing my skills I saw an opportunity 
for one-upmanship! Phenomena, and 
not least Uno, made sure I lived up to 
my arrogant promise. I had to deliver 
that scroller with an impossible bendy 
bar through it (and increased character 
height - vital information for any coder), 
or I would be a lamer and a bullshitter.

spread crack intros, Seven Sins, Mental

reference to Ranger's bbs at the time)

I started working with Slayer when 
he and I went to the same university, 
and we drank beer together. We 
never went into business together, 
because I think you should never 
mix business with friends.
We got into Scoopex and 
formed the Finnish section from calling cards (we 
started delivering them later on, once we got pages from 
American phone company catalogs...). We went from 
nobodies to being elite. Thanks to Ranger for accepting 
us as the Finnish sector of Scoopex. It was a blind call (in 
poker terms), but hopefully it paid out okay.
Back in the day, as an artist I looked up to J.O.E. / 
Scoopex, Terminator / TRSI, RA / Scoopex France, and 
Seen/Melon Dezign. As for my own graphics, I'm most 
proud of the still unreleased gfx. As for prods, I guess I 
liked Mental Hangover the most, even if it was mostly just 
logos and fonts and very ugly fill patterns.

cracker n.o.m.a.d. left and this probably 
influenced Ranger's decision to later 
leave the group when 1993 became 
1994. Naturally, Scoopex continued 
competing, with new talent and 
competition platforms - enter 40k, 
AGA, and accelerators. These years 
might well be considered in some ways 
to be the true Amiga demoscene period 
as we'd like to remember it- the Amiga 
The new effect was done from start to 
finish in fourteen evenings. 
'I think my "impossible" scroller pissed 
Slayer off. No less because I made sure to 
prevent lamer cartridge look-sees, so that 
you had to break the exe to see inside.
I had already made friends with 
Judas, Uncle Tom and Uno, but in my 
mind this was the clincher that got the 
okay from HQ to (re-)form Scoopex-
Sweden, together with Invid and 
Redskin in the autumn of 1990.
This was a memorable time in my 
scene life, and it's a pity that Real Life™ 
hit me (and many others). From Scoopex 
Sweden came a single dentro. Albeit 
influential, it felt like such a stab to the 
heart that none of us got to realise our 
dreams, just at the time that we felt we 
were at the top of our game. For me 
personally, it felt like the end of the world.'
In 1990, n.o.m.a.d., previously 
the main cracker, trainer-maker, and 
compact-maker for Slipstream-UK 
joined Scoopex and released over 
thirteen major cracks, plus single files 
and compacts. n.o.m.a.d. would go 
on to be one of the biggest names in 
the Amiga cracking scene for other 
legendary groups such as Genesis, the 
Angels-Defjam-Genesis co-op, Angels, 
Crystal, Quartex, Nemesis, and finally 
Fairlight before leaving the cracking 
scene in early 1994. 
So perhaps during 1991, the first 
wave of the Amiga demoscene started 
petering out. At least I think most of 
us felt groups were dying. Our main 
Scoopex's Uncle Tom looks back
A few party memories which have 
stuck with me are those times when 
Photon coded on caffeine pills. He 
ended up under the table with a 
nosebleed, and the ambulance came 
for him. At another party J.O.E. 
taught me how to draw light-sourced 
balls when I started painting. At the same party I went to 
buy sausages to grill in the woods behind the school. I was 
a little careless putting out the fire and the fire department 
came and put out a minor forest fire. I'm still not sure if it 
really was just my doing.
Outside parties, I remember lots of occasions meeting 
buddies and scene contacts, like doing a shoot 'em up with 
Photon, planning, coding, and drawing together. Just the 
ship's explosion were a huge amount of animation frames. 
Both frustrating and glorious times, then.
Nowadays life has turned around, people have jobs, 
other interests, and their own lives, and there's hardly time 
to vacuum the hallway. But I'm certainly not complaining. 
I have a job I like and colleagues with similar interests, plus 
above all you get a paycheck. I'll always remember the old 
times though, it was the first 'job' you had, you met people 
that completed your work and vice versa, and the result was 
demos, games and other potentially exciting projects.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
continued until 1998 with the Motorola 
Inside party, perhaps appropriately 
enough, in Finland.
Antibyte had been with Scoopex since 
the early days and had released crack 
intros for us, but the end of 1993 saw his 
ocs trackmo, Pha-Q. It was competitive 
and polished, perhaps a sign of things 
to come? In his words: 'In 1993-98, 
we abandoned the cracking scene and 
became a demogroup only. In that period 
we also reached the top of the charts 
again, carrying on Ranger's legacy. I want 
to emphasise that Mental Hangover 
revolutionised the demoscene across all

real-time presentation without discernible 
interruptions. Up to that point, people 
did megademos. After Mental Hangover, 
was the champion, and the pc was 
continually trying to catch up. It adapted 
and changed, from noisy high school 
lecture halls to large venues with big 
screens and big prizes. With voting no 
less dodgy and competition fiercer, the 
stakes were raised. Whoever wanted to 
be the best really had to prove it. For us, 
even though our pack disks continued 
into the hundreds, there was a short dip 
in demoscene prods, except for an entry 
into the shiny new 40k category earning 
fourth place at The Party! 2 in 1992.
In 1993, Scoopex organised 
CEBIT'93 in Germany - together 
with and sponsored by none other than 
Commodore. But there were quite a few 
party co-ops which had already started 
in 1989 with Share and Enjoy and 
Austrian coder Antibyte 
had quite an impact on 
Scoopex, helping to win 
for the group The Party!

and teamed up with Seenpoint, one of 
the most respected diskmags at the time.
The Amigascene side of things hit a 
slump from 2000 on as the PC finally 
became decent. 
It is accurate to describe the Scoopex 
narrative as largely an Amiga story. 
Even though we have certainly released 
on other platforms, it cannot be said 
that Scoopex moved over to PC. (In 
fact, very few groups did; new sceners 
and some old sceners did, but mostly 
in new groups and new collaborations.) 
But those who have paid attention have 
seen several releases each year, many of 
which have competed very well, with ten 
competition winners!

Indeed, Antibyte continued on aga. 
With Made and Virgill to name a few, he 
showcased effects and not least his honed 
3D engine, bringing first place wins 
to Scoopex with titles such as Alien 2, 
Superautodrome 1 and 2, and 1000%. 
Even Antibyte's non-competitive 
releases solidified Scoopex's reputation 
as we had great success in the diskmag 
charts; from April 1998 through to 
September 2000, Scoopex held the 
No1 place for Best Group, a staggering 
achievement.
This was the time when the French 
section bloomed, and also collaborations, 
both for demos and diskmags. Scoopex

at Datastorm in 2013/2014.
Starting in 2006, there was a 
reformation of Scoopex with new

of years later, he had to leave and 
appointed Photon organiser.
Since 2014, or perhaps starting as 
early as 2011, the ocs Amiga scene

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
commercial games of note were designed 
specifically for ecs, even though the 
chipset did replace ocs in the 'consumer' 
models - the A500+ and A600, as 
well as some of the last A500s to be 
manufactured.
ECS was soon replaced in 1992 by 
aga (Advanced Graphics Architecture), 
a new chipset that debuted in the high-
end A4000 and mass-market A1200 
models. This was a more significant 
upgrade, particularly when it came to 
graphics for games. Whereas ocs and 
ecs could typically display 32 colours 
from a palette of 4096, aga upped this to 
256 colours from more than 16 million. 
Smoother scrolling and wider hardware 
sprites were also introduced, among 
other enhancements, and the future of 
Amiga gaming suddenly looked very 
bright. Luminous even.
Visuals aside, the A1200 hardware 
also benefitted gaming in two key ways. 
A 68EC020 cpu was used which was a 
32-bit design as opposed to 16-bit, and 
ran at twice the speed of the 68000 
found in earlier models. Furthermore, 
the A1200 came with 2mb of main 
U
nder Commodore there 
were three different Amiga 
chipsets. The first was ocs 
(Original Chip Set) and the mere 
mention of it demands that we should 
all be upstanding, for it is thanks to this 
phenomenal design that the Amiga was 
able to deliver fantastic visuals and sound 
and become a powerful gaming platform. 
Indeed, the very reason you're reading 
this book right now is because of ocs and 
the amazing software it brought to life. 
So praise be to Agnus, Denise and Paula, 
and the creators of these custom chips. 
You may now be seated.
The revered ocs formed the guts of all 
Amiga models up until the release of the 
Amiga 3000 in 1990, at which point it 
was superseded by ecs (Enhanced Chip 
Set). ecs was backwards compatible with 
ocs and proved to be a slight upgrade, 
introducing additional high-res graphics 
modes that were intended for application 
software rather than games. As such no 
Martyn Carroll
The aga hardware boosted the graphics performance of 
the Amiga 1200 and 4000 models, but how much impact 
did this have on games? Martyn packs away his trusty old 
Amiga 500 in a bid to find out whether aga did make a 
difference, or if it was a case of too little too late.
"...the future of Amiga gaming suddenly 
looked very bright. Luminous even."

except that the main change was the 
introduction of overblown backgrounds 
that resembled wallpaper in a kid's 
nursery. To make matters worse the extra 
background detail had a negative impact 
on the frame-rate, resulting in the game 
actually playing slightly worse than the 
original.
Ocean's aga update of Sleepwalker 
provided more subtle enhancements. So 
subtle in fact that you'd struggle to spot 
the difference unless you played them 
memory (Chip ram) as standard, 
providing more space for graphics, sound 
and game data. ecs could address up to 
2mb of Chip ram, yet the stock low-
end models came with 1mb of memory 
(or less) so there was little point in 
designing games to take advantage of the 
extra memory. But now developers could 
use the full 2mb without worrying about 
owners of unexpanded machines being 
left out.
The presence of the faster cpu gave 
some existing 3D titles a speed boost, 
with Stunt Car Racer and Formula One 
Grand Prix being two notable examples. 
The extra memory was also utilised by 
several games to reduce disk-loading 
times. But let's be honest, anyone who 
owned a new aga Amiga was much 
more interested in the new wave of titles 
that would exploit the advanced chipset. 
The suspense was palpable, especially 
as key developers like Ocean, Gremlin, 
MicroProse and Team 17 promised to 
support the format. Commodore itself 
claimed that there would be between 
fifteen and twenty aga titles available by 
Christmas 1992.
Unfortunately that proved to be the 
hollowest of boasts. In fact, by April 
1993 the total number of aga games 
released was precisely four. And they 
were not aga exclusives but rather 
enhanced versions of older ocs titles. 
First up was an update of Gremlin's 
platformer Zool which was billed on 
the box as the 'Super Enhanced Amiga 
1200 Version'. This sounded promising,

side-by-side. There was some extra 
detail in the backgrounds (like little 
lights in the buildings on the city 
skyline) and the sprite shading was a 
touch smoother, but that was basically 
it - apart from during the opening 
cutscene where the bedroom walls and 
floor were different colours! This actually 
serves as a good analogy for the whole 
'update' situation, as developers would 
generally take existing properties and 
simply splash some new paint around.
This was certainly true of the next 
two aga updates: Trolls and Nigel 
Mansell's World Championship (although 
it must be said that Mansell's moustache 
looked resplendent in aga). The James 
Pond sequel Robocod was the next title 
to be trotted out and tarted up, some 
eighteen months after it originally 
debuted, and once again some new,  
colourful backgrounds were added. 
However, Millennium wisely added 
five brand new levels. It was a small 
addition but a welcome one in the eyes 
of A1200 owners who were desperately 
seeking something - anything - that was 
exclusive to aga, even if it was just an 
extra helping of fish supper.
AGA allows more enemies
Commodore itself did nothing to 
showcase the gaming potential of the 
A1200. The popular Desktop Dynamite 
bundle, released in October 1993, 
included some strong application 
software but the two games featured 
- Dennis and Oscar - were virtually 
identical to the existing ocs releases. 
Dennis in particular was a dire 
platformer with barely perceptible aga 
enhancements. Thankfully, the very same 
month saw the release of the first game 
that was designed exclusively for the 
aga hardware. Overkill from Mindscape 
was a frantic Defender-inspired shooter

that would only run on aga. This was 
a significant release. Not only was it a 
great game but it's difficult to imagine 
it running with the same level of 
smoothness and speed on an ocs Amiga. 
A precedent was set, yet it would be 
a long while before other publishers 
followed. 
All eyes shifted to Team 17 who were 
busy preparing the highly-anticipated 
Alien Breed II for Christmas 1993. The 
developer was renowned for pushing the 
Amiga hardware, so it was no surprise 
when it announced that the Alien Breed 
sequel would be developed for aga 
hardware. That certainly sat well with the 
firm's demoscene roots, yet it was also 
in the business of making money so it 
would have been reckless not to release 
an ocs version too. The solution was to 
release the aga version first and follow 
this up with a less sumptuous release for 
the far larger ocs user base.
However, the game's development 
diary was published in The One magazine 
where the programmers revealed that 
it was more practical to develop the 
graphics for the ocs version first and 
then retouch them for aga. This lowest-
common-denominator approach also

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
meant that some of the more ambitious 
design ideas, such as a proposed visual 
trick where the game would zoom out 
to show huge alien bosses dwarfing 
tiny player characters, were evidently 
dropped.
Ultimately the only key difference 
between the two versions was that the 
aga release allowed more enemies to 
be displayed on screen (which actually 
served to make the game overly 
difficult). Interestingly, the Team 17 guys 
also revealed in their diary that obtaining 
detailed aga technical information 
from Commodore was far from 
straightforward, which might explain the 
lack of widespread support.
Alien Breed II was the first of several 
high-profile titles that led with an aga 
version before being followed by an 
ever-so-slightly scaled-down ocs release. 
These included Team 17's own Body 
Blows Galactic, Ocean's Jurassic Park 
and Adventure Soft's Simon the Sorcerer. 
Meanwhile the process continued to 
operate in reverse with existing titles 
like The Chaos Engine, Soccer Kid and 
Zool 2 being updated with minimal 
justification for their existence beyond 
some extra colours and graphical detail. 
Heimdall 2 followed suit, but noticeably 
the enhanced aga release came on seven 
disks compared to the ocs version's 
Alien Breed II: The 
Horror Continues - ocs 
graphics retouched 
for the aga version.

four. Maybe this was another reason 
why many developers eschewed aga, as 
adventure games like Monkey Island 2 
and Legend of Kyrandia already came on 
a ridiculous number of floppies and full 
aga support would have only added to 
the number.
As there was often very little 
difference between the aga and ocs 
versions some publishers wisely opted 
to bundle them together in a single 
release. The first title of note to do 
this was Graftgold's Uridium 2 which 
would determine which hardware was 
available and then load the appropriate 
version. In the case of Uridium 2, if aga 
was detected then more sprites, effects 
and graphical detail would be displayed 
on-screen, and an extra-manic 'Mayhem 
Mode' was available. This 'hybrid' 
approach was adopted by a number of 
titles including Skidmarks, Liberation: 
Captive II and the third Alien Breed 
game Tower Assault. Not only did this 
reduce production costs for publishers 
but it was helpful for owners of older 
Amigas who were thinking about 
upgrading as they could purchase one

of these titles and then benefit from the 
enhancements (however small) when 
they finally acquired an A1200.
Those that did own an A1200 were 
finally rewarded in late 1994 when a 
number of top-quality and technically-
excellent aga exclusives arrived. The 
first was Core's Banshee, a co-op vertical 
shooter that played like a hyperactive 
version of 1942. The game looked 
great but it's best remembered for its 
varied and outrageously long levels 
(the opening stage took more than 
twelve minutes to finish). This was only 
achievable by filling the full 2mb ram.
Banshee was followed by Super 
Stardust, the aga-exclusive sequel to 
Bloodhouse's original Asteroids update. 
As with its predecessor it was the 3D 
tunnel sections that truly impressed 
and these were more mesmerising 
than ever on aga hardware. Similarly, 
computerised pinball never looked better 
than in Pinball Illusions, the third (and 
first aga-only) entry in Digital Illusions' 
much-loved series of simulators. Aladdin 
was another aga exclusive that boasted 
gorgeous cartoon visuals that matched 
those in the 
celebrated Mega 
Drive version. 
Theme Park and 
UFO: Enemy 
Unknown

mentioned here,

because although they later received 
separate ocs releases they were clearly 
hamstrung compared to the aga 
originals.
In 1995 the A1200 received ports 
of Guardian and Roadkill, two very 
good games that had originally debuted 
on the Amiga CD32, Commodore's 
aga-powered, cd-based console. CD32 
owners had been inundated with A1200 
ports (typically with an animated intro 
and cd soundtrack slapped on), so it 
was novel - and not unwelcome - to 
see the process happening the other 
way round. However, 1995 was without 
doubt the year of the Doom clone in 
the Amiga gaming world and several 
titles vied for attention including Gloom, 
Fears, Breathless and Alien Breed 3D. 
All of these attempts were aga-only, 
naturally, but it quickly transpired that 
an unexpanded A1200 wasn't really up 
to the job. If you wanted to glide down 
richly-detailed 3D corridors then you 
needed more memory and ideally an 
accelerator card too for a cpu speed 
boost. And back then upgrading an 
Amiga was expensive and not something 
the majority of casual users would be 
inclined to do.
This trend continued in 1996, with 
two very good 3D games - the fun 
racer XTreme Racing and the ambitious 
Alien Breed 3D 2 - requiring Amigas 
with plenty of grunt to play as the 
developers intended them. It wasn't all 
about 3D though, as in the same year 
came the arrival of two top-drawer 2D 
titles. The first was Slam Tilt, another 
pinball title and quite possibly the best

game of its type. Finally, 1996 ended 
with the release of Worms: The Director's 
Cut, a super-enhanced version of the 
original hit which was almost like Team 
17's love letter to the Amiga faithful. 
However, the firm has since revealed 
that its affection wasn't exactly 
reciprocated as the game only 
sold a miserable 4,000 copies. It 
appeared that over time the Amiga 
gaming market had shrunk to almost 
nothing.
It's not known exactly how many 
Amiga 1200s were sold worldwide, 
but it's clear that the introduction 
of aga did little to reverse declining 
hardware sales - a trend that led to 
Commodore's collapse in April 1994. It's 
very easy to get bogged down in 'what 
ifs', questioning whether Commodore 
made the right hardware decisions 
and whether a more radical upgrade 
would have attracted wider software 
support.Would the introduction of the 
long-gestating, next-gen aaa (Amiga 
Advanced Architecture) chipset in 
place of aga have changed the course 
of Amiga history? Perhaps, but 
regardless, this book is about celebrating 
the very best Amiga games and that 
unquestionably includes some of the 
titles outlined above that were aga 
exclusive, or at least aga-enhanced to a 
significant degree. 
It's a small selection of games, 
probably a dozen at most, but they're 
important nonetheless - and if you 
worshipped at the altar of ocs then you 
owe it to yourself to seek them out.

O
riginally released for the long-forgotten 
Dragon 32 computer in 1987, Airball would 
have to wait two years to really make its name 
when it was reworked for the 16-bit generation. At 
heart the game is an isometric arcade adventure, a 
genre much lauded on 8-bit computers but largely 
forgotten with the next generation.
What makes Airball especially interesting when 
compared to similar games is the use of air itself. 
To complete the game the player must keep the air 
in the ball topped up via inflating stations. But use 
them too much and the ball bursts! So it's all about 
keeping it balanced.
  The plot of the game revolves around you being 
turned into the titular Airball by an evil wizard and 
the only way to return to human form is by finding 
the items needed to break the spell. Of course there 
are lots of hazards out there for a fragile ball of air! 
Airball is a beautifully designed adventure that 
slipped under the radar for many.

Psygnosis owl would take on this role, but in this

Agony looks beautiful (graphics by Franck

not only of the hardware on offer but also the in-
game character. This is because the owl possesses 
echo-location, just as a real night prowler would, 
and this acts as your weapon. You must guide the 
owl through all six of the stunning fantasy-themed 
worlds defeating the enemies, collecting the power-
ups and ultimately gaining back a human form.
As impressive as the visuals are in Agony, we must 
also give a mention to the wonderful soundtrack, 
which is provided by both Tim 'Cold Storage' Wright 
and Jeroen Tel. Agony is not just a great game, it's a

N
ot to be confused with Palace Software's much 
more famous one-on-one fighter of the same 
name, Barbarian by Psygnosis is a sprawling arcade- 
adventure with a rather unique control system.
Oddly designed to be controlled with the Amiga 
two-button mouse, the whole game operates via 
a simple on-screen menu system. One press of the 
button activates a panel at the bottom of the screen 
where each action is selected. Excluding direction 
movement, there are six different actions that 
include attacking as well as defensive manoeuvres. 
Now this may sound quite fiddly and awkward, but 
once accustomed to it, the system almost becomes 
second nature and works rather well.
I guess you could describe Barbarian as a 
thinking man's hack 'n slash. Barbarian spawned an 
equally adept sequel, as well as two spin-off games 
in Ork and Leander that all form part of a loosely 
themed arcade-style fantasy adventure series from 
Psygnosis.

W
hen talking about controversial video games 
over the years, Barbarian: The Ultimate 
Warrior (marketed by Epyx in the US under the title 
Death Sword) is not only one of the earliest games to 
earn the monicker but also the most notable.
This one-on-one fighter first caused an outcry 
(more from parents than players) over its extreme 
level of violence which includes being able to chop 
somebody's head clean off with a sword. Worse still 
for some were the cover art and adverts featuring 
Page Three girl Maria Whittaker in a very scantily 
clad state. This led many publications to censor the 
image and even refuse to take advertising for the 
game. Horny, bloodthirsty schoolboys everywhere 
clamoured to get their hands on the finished 
product.
Fortunately there is a lot more to Barbarian than 
sex and gore as the game itself actually turns out to 
be pretty good too. The player takes the role of the 
eponymous barbarian and faces eight other muscular 
weapon-wielding foes in order to rescue Princess

P
sygnosis was undoubtedly one of the most 
prestigious publishers of the Amiga years and 
DMA Design rank right up there among the most 
proficient developers. But despite being one of their 
best selling games, Blood Money is not a title you 
hear discussed nearly enough.
Inspired by the Irem arcade game Mr. Heli, Blood 
Money is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up that 
just oozes class from every orifice. The game's most 
important aspect is its power-up system. Every 
enemy destroyed drops coins and it's essential to 
collect them before they fall off the screen. These 
may then be spent in one of the shops that pop 
up throughout each level. And it's important to 
upgrade weapons substantially as progress is made 
because later levels get extremely tough.
As good looking as Blood Money is, it's Ray

been better as it followed hot on the heels of the 
Gulf War's conclusion and the allied victory over 
Saddam Hussein.
In Desert Strike the player controls an American 
Apache helicopter flying into the warzone to take 
out designated targets and rescue hostages. There 
are various crates littered around the desert to find 
containing extra ammo, fuel and armour which 
are essential for completing the mission. One of 
the game's most important aspects is lowering the 
winch to collect the crates and rescue your comrades 
without getting shot down.
This Amiga port, which came out a year after the 
Sega version, actually improves on the original.

: 	 First Samurai
Year	
:	 1991
Publisher	 :	 Image Works / Vivid Image

T
his is a beautiful platform game with both 
adventure and fighting elements, in which you 
take the role of the very first samurai on a quest to 
rid the world of evil.
Set in ancient Japan, First Samurai offers a 
wide range of weapons, special items and other 
objects which can be used to help complete the 
quest. In every sense of the word First Samurai is 
an atmospheric game. The stunning landscapes and 
beautifully animated sprites set the scene perfectly 
while a huge range of effects and digitised speech 
samples elevate the play even further. It isn't all 
about the look though - the action is relentless, 
there is always something that needs doing and it 
isn't a game to bore anyone quickly.
In spite of its short time on sale, First Samurai 
was a huge hit on its release. It soared to the top 
of the charts and received rave reviews from the 
gaming press, most notably when it appeared on the 
GamesMaster TV show, earning a score of 90%.

Digital Illusions

T
he first game by the team we now know as 
DICE, Pinball Dreams started a pinball 
revolution with a level of realism that hadn't been 
seen before. There are four tables in the game 
covering different themes such as the Wild West for 
Steel Wheel, space rockets for Ignition, a haunted 
graveyard for Nightmare and a pop music styled 
affair for Beat Box.
The excellent graphics are the first thing to 
impress at the start of play. They really make use of 
the Amiga's huge colour palette. The magnificent 
visuals aren't the only thing in Pinball Dreams to 
impress - the ball movement is absolutely spot-on 
and the handy tilt function manipulates the ball 
just like a real table. There is even a dot-matrix-style 
panel for score display and bonus messages, which 
adds even more to the arcade-like authenticity. 
Pinball Dreams doesn't slouch when it comes to 
audio either, with digitised speech and some really 
memorable tunes.

T 
	 oki was one of the less well known of the 
period's arcade games, named more poetially 
by its Japanese creators JuJu Densetsu. Nevertheless, 
Ocean's port to the Amiga is a highly impressive 
one and hard to ignore. The basic plot of this shoot 
'em up platformer involves an evil wizard turning a 
prince into an ape and stealing away his princess. 
You control the enchanted heroic primate as he 
makes his way through the levels to rescue her. Toki's 
main weapons are fireballs he spits at his numerous 
enemies to kill them; he can also jump on their 
heads to stun them. Toki sure is a very tough game 
so thankfully ther are various power-ups to collect, 
such as lucky rabbits' feet which give him bursts of 
super-ape jumping ability. There are clocks to slow 
each level's countdown timer, coins that increase 
the player's score and a hilarious American football 
helmet for extra protection.
The levels are beautifully designed and feature 
some seriously big bosses who take up the whole 
screen. With its wonderful visuals, great music 
and tight gameplay Toki has to be one of the best 
platformers available for the Amiga and a must-
have for fans of the genre.

L
emmings went on to appear on almost every 
platform under the sun from ZX Spectrum to 
Philips CD-i, but the Amiga version is the original 
and arguably still the best. The idea of Lemmings is 
pretty simple - to guide a troop of accident-prone 
blue-haired lemmings through each level, while 
trying to save as many of the creatures as possible.
Each lemming can be assigned a skill such as 
digger, climber, stopper or builder to help them 
make their way to the exit. Because lemmings are 
stupid they just keep on walking until they are 
stopped or killed.
On each stage there are a limited amount of 
different skills and a percentage figure of how many 
lemmings must be saved, and then it's up to the 
player to find the best way to achieve the goal. If 
it all goes wrong though, there is the now famous 
nuke button: press it, sit back and watch lemmings 
explode all over the screen! Lemmings is an all-time 
classic forever etched in the Amiga's history.

O

games during the 16-bit years The Bitmap 
Brothers are right up there among the very best. 
The quality of the games they created was second 
to none and Speedball 2 is regarded by many as the 
pinnacle of those efforts.
The game plays like a cross between handball 
and ice hockey and greatly improves on its already 
excellent predecessor. Your team of players can 
catch, run with and throw the ball, the latter being 
used to both score points and pass. Points are scored 
by either throwing the ball into the goal or by using 
a series of multipliers around the arena. There are 
also power-ups with a temporary effect and coins to 
be collected to help the purchase of new players or 
upgrade the current ones. Each player has a limited 
energy bar and it's actually possible to take players 
out of the game with enough hits! Speedball 2 looks 
great, sounds fantastic and plays even better.

ainbow Islands is the second of four Taito 
arcade games featuring Bub and Bob. The 
sequel to Bubble Bobble, Bubble Symphony and 
Bubble Memories followed, and there were two direct 
sequels: Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2.
In Rainbow Islands Bub & Bob are back but this 
time in their human form and armed with rainbows 
instead of bubbles. In another change from the first 
game the levels now scroll, but not horizontally like 
most platformers - in Rainbow Islands you run and 
jump vertically. And do this swiftly or get swallowed 
by the water rising from below if you don't make it 
to the top in time.
Each island has a different theme but they are 
all bright and colourful with a host of cute creatures 
desperate to kill you. Like Bubble Bobble when an 
enemy dies it gives up fruity bonuses, diamonds 
and sometimes power-ups too. At the end of each 
island there's a huge end-of-level boss to defeat. 
Rainbow Islands has to rank among the finest arcade 
conversions ever to grace the Commodore Amiga.

A
fter the massive success of Xenon The Bitmap 
Brothers came back with this outstanding 
sequel. Unlike the original this is more of a 
traditional vertically scrolling shooter with one of 
the best soundtracks of any game ever made.
Although for the most part the game is fairly 
generic with its array of enemies, stage designs 
and end-of-level bosses, it does have a few 
unique features of its own. The first comes in the 
utterly insane power-up system that allows every 
conceivable type of power-up imaginable to be 
collected and bolted on. After a time the ship 
becomes some sort of magnetic scrapyard with bits 
clinging all over the hull.
The second feature is the reverse scrolling - by 
'pushing' down towards the bottom of the screen 
you can make it scroll backwards a small amount, 
this is especially useful when trapped in tight spots 
or fighting a barrage of fire from a massive boss.
Xenon 2 is every bit as essential for any Amiga 
owner as its equally excellent forerunner.

his sequel to International Karate adds a 
number of new features which totally alter 
the game's  dynamic while leaving it feeling very 
familiar. In the main change there are now two 
other players to be fought at once, either both are 
cpu-controlled or cpu plus another human.
In each round the first and second ranked players 
progress, a matter decided by how many hits are 
landed on the opponents. Lots of quick movement 
is required to stay on top and not get hit in the back 
while you go for the win.
The other great new feature is the addition of 
crazy bonus stages - such as one where you have to 
use a big shield to deflect balls being thrown at you. 
IK + also has more than a few secrets to discover, 
adding even more to the entertainment. With its 
brilliant animation, great use of colour, attention 
to detail and wonderful backgrounds International 
Karate + looks amazing. David Lowe's excellent 
music rounds off the package, making this the best

own with the arrival of 16-bit computers, 
and Stunt Car Racer is possibly the most famous 
and highly regarded. Programmed by the king 
of computer racing games, the legendary Geoff 
Crammond, it was released to widespread acclaim.
Stunt Car Racer is very different to anything that 
came before and is best described as a racing game 
crossed with a roller coaster. The race takes place on 
a series of tracks high up in the air and it's an easy  
matter to fall off. If that occurs a giant crane hoists 
you back up with a loss of valuable time.
The idea of the game is to compete against 
opponents in a league and try to win each division. 
One of the game's unique features is that in addition 
to having an Amiga-Amiga link-up you can link 
an Amiga to an Atari ST to enjoy multi-player 
shenanigans. Stunt Car Racer is lauded as one of 
the best of the 16-bit computer generation for good

than it's the greatest football video game 
ever created? It doesn't look realistic, doesn't really 
sound realistic and certainly doesn't have any fancy 
features like player stats or transfers. But despite 
these apparent drawbacks it manages to be the only 
football game that's actually as much fun to play as 
the real thing.
Programmed by legendary Sensible Software, 
it was the game that knocked the mighty Kick Off 
series from its lofty perch. Because the tiny little 
players are viewed from above you can see a large 
amount of the pitch at once, which makes it easier 
to perform long passes, crosses and score outlandish 
goals. Sensible Soccer features real teams and players 
from around Europe, as well as a load of made up 
ones, but they can be fully edited to keep them up 
to date.
One of the best features of Sensi is the after-
touch feature, which allows the ball to be curved by 
a small amount after it's been kicked.

International Karate, Whirlwind Snooker utilised the 
Amiga's capabilities to the best and revolutionised 
snooker and pool video games. With the exception of 
3D Pool on the Spectrum (1989), before Whirlwind 
Snooker games based on green baize tables were viewed 
in flat 2D from above. In this title, - officially endorsed 
by legendary multi-time champion Jimmy White - 
the 3D makes the game seem far more realistic and 
gives the player much greater control over the ball and 
viewing angles. You can rotate the table 360º, zoom in 
on any ball, configure all the settings and even use the 
virtual chalk. The box actually boasts that there are an 
amazing 164 million different outcomes to any shot, 
pretty incredible when you think about it.
As serious as the game is, Archer still managed to

quote Defender of the Crown as being the first 
real game changer in the computer's history and the 
one that set it apart from the competition thanks 
to some stunning graphics and sound. It's also the 
game that put publishers Cinemaware on the map.
Defender of the Crown is a strategy war game with 
arcade elements. You are a Saxon knight leading an 
army against the invading Norman forces. The sole 
objective is to capture all the counties of both England 
and Wales, and then unite them as king. Success is 
awarded through building armies, gathering weapons 
and collecting gold by sacking castles.
The arcade elements revolve around many of 
these actions in a series of mini-games. For example, 
on sacking an opponent's castle the player must 
lead three soldiers into its precincts and battle the 
opposing troops to steal the gold. Another sequence 
features a joust against challengers, which is a great

Publisher	 :	 Gremlin Graphics / Magnetic Fields

A
s excellent as the original Lotus Esprit Turbo 
   Challenge (1990) was, this sequel took things 
to a new level. Developers Magnetic Fields ditched 
the lap-based touring car realism of the first game 
and instead went for an arcade style racer much in 
the vein of Sega's classic Out Run.
Note too that designers Shaun Southern and 
Andrew Morris omitted the word 'Esprit' from the 
title, focusing instead on the Lotus brand. This was 
due to the addition of a new car, the much lighter 
weight Lotus Elan SE. In another significant change 
Lotus 2's single-player mode uses all of the game 
screen instead of half, as in the original, and the 
player drives an Elan on odd levels and the Esprit on 
even ones.
Another great feature of this excellent racing 
game is the facility to link one Amiga to another, 
or even to an Atari ST, so up to four can play at the 
same time. You can also return to where you left 
off with the addition of a handy password feature. 
There is no doubting that Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 is 
up there with the very best Amiga racers.

do about it? The lords of Waterdeep summon a 
band of heroes to go and investigate. But someone 
or something has been watching the proceedings 
and after the heroes enter the sewers, the ceiling 
collapses behind them leaving them trapped.
The only way out is down, into dungeons filled

The starting party consists of four characters and 
up to two NPCs can join the squad later. Combat

are over forty different spells.
A clever point-and-click interface makes 
exploring, fighting, spell casting and handling

F
rom the mind of the often controversial Peter 
Molyneux came Populous, widely regarded as 
the first 'god game'. While in its basic concept it 
doesn't sound like much fun - the key element is the 
raising and lowering of land - in practice it becomes 
engrossing in the attempt to increase player powers, 
eliminate rival deities and punish non-followers 
with earthquakes and lightning.
Played from an impressive isometric 3D 
perspective, all actions are performed through using 
the control panel which surrounds the play area. In 
all there are an incredible 500 levels to work through 
before players may call themselves the one true god.
The key to the game is generating mana, which is 
done by gaining followers and keeping your existing 
followers happy. The more mana you produce the 
more features and abilities are unlocked.
Populous is a timeless classic and a real time- 
vampire that can engage unwary players for hours 
on end. It was succeeded by an equally excellent 
Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods which

You are at the controls of the eponymous

offers twelve missions to complete and those may 
be trebled with the addition of the two expansion

Although particular praise is always given to the

Death also takes advantage of the Amiga's advanced 
hardware with full use being made of all the custom 
chips. One of  Wings of Death's more interesting 
features is the ability to transform into different 
creatures. Starting out as an eagle you can increase 
firepower by transforming into mythical flying 
beasts such as a griffin and even a huge dragon. 
The ultimate mission is to return to human

D
ungeon crawlers have always been a hugely 
popular genre, right from the day that Atari 
first unleashed Gauntlet on arcade audiences. 
Team 17 certainly can't be credited for originality 
with Alien Breed, it most certainly takes its cue from 
Gauntlet and, even more so perhaps, Sega's Alien 
Syndrome. But what it does is to take those games, 
add in the atmosphere from the Alien film franchise 
and then raise it all to a new level.
Not content with serving up an almost endless 
supply of xenomorphs, Alien Breed also stacks the 
odds against the player even more by sending in 
some huge bosses. Thankfully Team 17 evened 
up the odds a little by also providing some pretty 
serious firepower that can be upgraded throughout 
the game.
Alien Breed has had numerous sequels (eight 
to date excluding the 1992 Special Edition, the last 
being Alien Breed 3: Descent in 2010) that take the

Martin Edmondson's game originally started off

Taking the role of wannabe pirate Guybrush

The beauty of Monkey Island is that it's full of

While it won't win any awards in the graphics

hen I first saw Cannon Fodder I was oblivious

soldiers shooting other little soldiers and just had to 
beg my mum for it! Cannon Fodder is a challenging, 
addictive romp through varying terrain to eliminate 
the enemy and blow up their buildings, utilising your 
squad, their guns, grenades and rockets.
The point-and-click control feels right, even if 
the vehicles can be maddening to drive, more often 
than not resulting in a mission-ending crash. Each 
soldier has a name and rises through the ranks after 
successful missions, which means you get attached 
to them. The increasing number of headstones in 
the mission-start screen cemetery shows just how 
many of these guys you have sent to their deaths. 
Little violent touches, such as enemies going into 
convuslions before dying or a lone body floating 
down the river, are brilliant details.  
Despite a nice sequel I would love to see a return 
of this classic series. What do you do when your

V
ery few strategy games over the years had such 
a huge impact as the original Civilization (also 
known as Sid Meier's Civilization). It's testament to 
the success of this game that sequels are still being 
published to this very day.
 In developing Civilization Meier decided to give 
the player complete control over their own destiny. 
Micromanagement like this had never been seen in 
a game of this type before and it made the battle for 
world domination that little bit more satisfying.
However there's a lot more to Civilization than 
warfare. The player takes the role of a nation's leader 
and as such is required to master a combination of 
skills as a diplomat, a politician, an explorer and 
an inventor. The way each element is exploited is 
central to the player's success and the way the game 
progresses.
The timeline is also a great deal more expansive 
than similar titles. Commencing in 4000 bc, it 
speeds through the millennia: from the Bronze Age 
to the Space Age - the timeline is staggering. The 
only drawback to Civilization is the many days lost 
to playing it!

of This World) was a real game-changer in the 
world of 16-bit computers. Essentially it's just 
a flick-screen arcade-adventure, but that simple 
statement fails to do the game justice.
The stunning visuals are the key to Another 
World's brilliance. All the game characters and the 
jaw-dropping scenes are rendered from vector 
graphics to look as if they are formed from polygons. 
The pastel colours help set the scene perfectly and 
the sprite animation is almost faultless.
When an experiment conducted by physics 
professor Lester goes wrong, he's an alien world. 
Taking on the role of Lester, the player must do 
whatever it takes to escape.
This is accomplished through a combination of 
arcade platform action requiring precise jumping 
and combat, and puzzle solving that can test the 
most accomplished gamer. Another World isn't a 
game that can just be played and completed, it's one 
that you have to learn and experience. The concept 
was taken even further by the semi-sequel Flashback, 
but the scene was definitely set by Another World.

in 1992 and has seen yearly updates ever since. In 
2004 Sports Interactive jumped ship from Eidos, 
owners of the franchise, over to Sega to continue 
the game under the Football Manager banner, where 
it still remains the definitive football management 
game to this day.
While sports management simulations of this 
type have existed since the rise of home computers 
in the early 1980s, Championship Manager took 
the level of realism and turned it up to full heat. 
Sports Interactive handed you every aspect of club 
management from hiring and firing staff to stadium 
expansion and setting up training ground routines. 
They also added mass appeal with actual matches 
to watch featuring commentary from well-known 
pundit Clive Tyldesly. There was no better thrill 
back then than taking a lowly team from the bottom 
of the football pyramid to ultimate glory by winning 
the European Cup!

W
orms is without doubt the game that put Team 
17 on the map and its popularity was so huge 
that the franchise is still going to this very day. This is 
a strategy war game with a big dollop of comedy that 
looks a bit like Lemmings, with its little sprites and 
detailed backgrounds, but plays very differently.
You take control of a team of four worms 
facing up to three other teams, which can either be 
human- or computer-controlled. At your disposal 
are a number of weapons (all of which have different 
effects on your opponent) and a series of useful tools 
that can be used to manipulate the environment 
around you. 
Games are played across a series of randomly 
generated levels each following a different theme 
with its own traits affecting the way the game is 
played. Worms is a true classic in every sense and it 
never bores.

n the quest to create a Sonic for the Amiga very few 
attempts really held up, but without any doubt one 
of the best was Graftgold's Fire & Ice, a stunningly 
beautiful platformer starring a similarly blue fellow 
called Cool Coyote. Steve Turner's team had previous 
stirling form in the area of platformers, having given 
us the excellent Amiga port of Rainbow Islands, so 
the quality of this title was no surprise.
A feature of Fire & Ice that sets it apart from its 
competition is the map showing the current world 
visible at the bottom of the screen. Another unique 
feature is the way you have to freeze enemies with an 
icy projectile before you can kill them.
Fire & Ice is widely regarded as one of the best 
Amiga platformers (and best looking) of all-time

universe where military scientists have 
disposed of all the defective military droids on 
the lonely uncolonised planet Ryxx. The surviving 
droids eventually become sentient (à la Skynet) and 
vow vengeance on humans. They occupy a former

The mission: journey to this world, initiate 
Project-X and eliminate the droid forces. The plot 
is probably more original than the game, but don't 
let that put you off, because while Project-X does 
nothing new it does everything very well.
Nothing more than a scrolling shoot 'em up 
over five levels in the vein of Gradius and Darius, 
it's among the best of this genre for the Amiga. The 
graphics are beautiful, the power-up system works 
extremely well and the digitised sound adds to the 
experience. For the many who found the levels 
too hard, Team 17 released Project-X SE, with the 
difficulty level lowered.

world in a variety of ways. They team up in twos, 
either group computer-controlled or by a second

Thug, Brigand and Mercenary, and Gentleman

own unique advantages and drawbacks. There are

ne area where the Amiga really struggled to 
compete with consoles was in the genre of 
one-on-one fighters. In 1993 Team 17 tried to fix 
that with the release of Body Blows, a pretty blatant 
clone of Capcom's Street Fighter II.
The game features eleven fighters, of which four 
are selectable and the rest act as opponents. In two-
player mode each player can fight the other after 
choosing a character, and Tournament mode lets 
four or eight players battle against each other.Two 
fighters are clear copies of SFII's Ken and Ryu.
While the game did suffer from the constraints 
of using a one-button joystick, the press received it 
well. CU Amiga gave it 91% as the best game of its 
type on the Amiga and The One actually thought it 
was even better than Street Fighter II, awarding it 
92%. Mature reflection suggests it didn't deserve 
those accolades, but it's still a quality fighting game.

Designed and programmed by Jez San, who

feature of Starglider is the great digitised music by 
Dave 'Uncle Art' Lowe, which included a fifteen-

was included on Dave Lowe's 2016 studio album A 
Temporal Shift. This isn't where the features ended

a mix of platformer, adventure and shooting, and with 
some great driving music tracks by  Chris Hülsbeck.
There are three primary weapons at your 
disposal in Turrican II: The Final Fight, each with its 
advantages: bounce, laser, multiple shot beam and a 
'laser wall' which sweeps out either side. In addition 
holding down the fire button unleashes a steerable 
laser beam, but it prevents movement while in use. 
Collect power-ups to upgrade standard weapons, 
including shields offering brief invulnerability.
One memorable aspect of Turrican II is the way 
you can transform. A press of the space bar turns you

T
he story goes that while designer Will Wright 
was developing Raid on Bungeling Bay for 
Broderbund he found that he was having more fun 
with the level editor than the actual game itself. This 
inspired him to create a game in which players could 
develop their own worlds.
That title would become Sim City, a game that 
revolutionised strategy games and created a whole 
new genre within it. What made Sim City a ground 
breaker was its lack of a final goal - you could 
neither win nor lose. Consequently, for many years 
no software house wanted to publish it, certain that 
game players wouldn't be interested without coins 
and power-ups to collect, baddies to destroy and 
arcade skills to flaunt, but how wrong they were!
The developers did later add some goals but 
they were just a diversion from the real point of 
simply building and managing a city down to the 
finest detail. Sim City's legacy is clear to see, as the 
series is every bit as loved today as it ever was.

it's rightly held in high regard.

While Gods is a pretty standard arcade-adventure

really struggling to make headway. Another unusual 
feature is the ability to upgrade and improve weapons, 
which puts more focus on the game's fighting aspect.
Once again the Bitmaps used their contacts 
in the music industry to add a wonderful music

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
The school's curriculum didn't yet 
include computer studies, so I learned 
from books and magazines. Even so I 
focused on A-Levels, but ended up with 
a D, two Es and an F and decided there 
was no point going to university. I'd be in 
a better position after three years of work. 
I failed to get a coding job and ended 
up as a computer operator working 
on mainframes (including a Cray 1 
which was kind of cool) for four years 
before taking a pay cut to work as a 
programmer for a company making 
high end Telex machines. I was made 
redundant a year later but by then I had 
learned C and had an Atari ST (the 
Amiga 1000 was out of my price range) 
and was playing with bits of graphics 
code and drawing stuff using the ST art 
package NEOchrome. 
During the year at the telex place I 
spent most lunch breaks hanging out 
at the local games shop with others, 
including Kevin Donkin. He bragged 
about how he worked on Amiga 
computers for a company called Taurus. 
I bugged him for an interview which he 
eventually arranged. 
I 
saw my first computer shortly after 
starting sixth form in September 
1980. I had vague thoughts of being a 
draftsman but that was because technical 
drawing was my only A-grade O-Level. 
I was supposed to be studying maths and 
geology but the school had a couple of 
Commodore Pets in a room off one of 
the physics labs that proved to be a bit of 
a distraction from school. 
I spent all of my free periods playing 
with the things. Then I bought a ZX81 
and I remember buying an assembler 
and disassembler for £5 each at a ZX 
Microfair. I got half of that money back 
by selling copies of both to the head of 
the geography department.

Glenn Corpes
Having proved he could draw a piece of wood, Glenn 
was present at the very start of games software developer 
Bullfrog and contributed to many of its pivotal 
Commodore Amiga titles, not least being Populous.

Firebird's C64/Spectrum game, Druid II: 
Enlightenment. This had been written by 
a couple of fourteen-year-old kids called 
Andrew Bailey (who also coded ADrum) 
and Dene Carter, who we didn't meet 
at the time but famously ended up at 
Bullfrog years later. The port was done 
with no reference to the original source 
code at all. I was drawing graphics and 
editing levels on the Amiga with a C64 
running the original's level editor sitting 
next to it. 
I wasn't coding on the game but I 
came up with the idea of replacing the 
game's 32x32 blocks with a foreground, 
background and mask to utilise the 
Amiga's three source blitting capabilities. 
I also got to design the collision system 
simply because I'd actually spent more 
time in the past trying to do that sort of 
thing than either of the programmers. I 
At the interview I met Peter 
Molyneux who, after chatting about 
programming for hours, told me he 
and Kevin had it covered - they had no 
coding vacancies. But I'd mentioned I 
could draw a bit so he sat me down in 
front of an Amiga with Deluxe Paint and 
said, 'Draw a bit of wood.' I sat there 
playing with the subtle (compared to the 
ST) palette and cool blend tools until 
I drew something that looked a bit like 
a plank with wood grain on it...and 
somehow got a job as an artist!
My first day was just after the huge 
storm in 1987. Peter and his business 
partner Les Edgar could see where the 
Amiga was headed and wanted to start 
doing games with a new company. Les 
came up with Bullfrog as a placeholder 
name and reference to the parent 
company Taurus (named after the fact 
the two of them shared that star sign), 
nobody else liked the name but it stuck 
because there were no better suggestions.
Bullfrog was born and I can claim to 
be the first employee because the other 
five people working there were still being 
paid by Taurus.	
Bullfrog's first title was a drum 
machine though it was a little more 
than that. It was a kind of ProTracker 
and went on to be used for the music 
in Druid II, Fusion and Populous. My 
first ever published work in the industry 
was an image that became the box art 
and load screen (complete with colour 
cycling 'animation') for ADrum.
Bullfrog's first title was a port of 
Deluxe Paint - ideal for 
drawing wood!

was bought for £10,000 which still didn't 
cover the costs although it had been 
cheaper to make as Kevin had handled 
almost all of the programming. This had 
allowed Peter to go back to working for 
Taurus for a while. Fusion also featured 
support for a second joystick button if 
you used a Sega Master System joystick. 
It also recorded your game and played 
it back as an 'attract mode', the player 
could also break into this playback and 
take over at any point. It predated Killing 
Game Show by over a year too.
Making a 'god game' work
At this point I was acutely aware of 
the fact that the company was running 
at a loss and nobody had given me 
anything to do. I took matters into my 
own hands and brought my ST into 
the office, ostensibly to port Fusion to it 
but more to brush up my programming 
skills in case I needed a new job. After 
think Bullfrog were paid £7000 for the 
game which didn't get close to covering 
costs, it never sold enough to make a 
royalty payment.
Fusion was an attempt to utilise as 
much as possible from Druid II 
and make a game more cheaply. 
Peter added some flexibility to 
the editor. This meant that masks 
and foregrounds could be mixed 
in any combination, allowing 
some nice effects and increased 
variation. It also ran in 64 colour 
half-bright mode which gave 32 
extra colours half as bright as the 
normal 32. These were used for shadows. 
This was actually pretty stupid as it 
meant the game needed a small window 
to run at a near-decent frame rate. 
The game itself was a weird mix of 
shooter and puzzle game, which seemed 
like a surefire win at the time but with 
hindsight probably just made it less 
likely to appeal to anyone. Although 
Electronic Arts published it, it had the 
same producer as Druid II since Joss Ellis 
had moved there from Firebird. I think it

handled all of the possible combinations 
needed to make a set of slopes. I then 
filled the map memory with random 
block numbers and, sure enough, the 
ST could throw down these blocks at a 
decent speed. This was largely due to the 
fact that they were drawn on 16 pixel 
boundaries so they didn't suffer from the 
slow-shift problem that had foiled my 
attempt to port Fusion.
The problem was, I now needed some 
map data rather than random floating 
blocks. At this point I made the first of 
many laziness inspired decisions: I could 
have written an editor but I reckoned 
it would be easier to write some code 
to generate test data so I wrote my first 
landscape generator. 
This was basically a few pages of C 
that threw my 16 blocks into the map 
memory in a way that looked a bit like 
a landscape. I say 'a bit' because it really 
looked more like a bunch of intersecting 
green pyramids. It was a slight pain to 
check the generated maps as to see them 
you had to scroll the 8x8 viewing window 
around the 64x64 map. You could only 
a few hours it quickly became apparent 
that the ST just couldn't handle the 
horizontal scrolling. The 68000's shift 
instructions were just too slow which is 
of course why the Amiga has hardware 
for blitting and scrolling.  
It was apparent that I wasn't going to 
be able to turn Bullfrog's fortunes round 
with an ST version of Fusion so I decided 
to try something that I'd been thinking 
about for a while. My favourite game 
on my Amstrad CPC464 had been Paul 
Shirley's classic Spindizzy. I set about 
recreating its isometric system.
Spindizzy screens seemed to consist 
of an 8x8x8 grid of isometric blocks, 
each drawn in 32x24 pixels. Clearly there 
was something more than that going 
on to get it working so quickly on 8-bit 
machines but for now, I was planning to 
brute force it.
I drew some blocks just like some 
of Spindizzy's. Basically a set of 16 that 
Spindizzy from Electronic 
Arts - on the Amstrad 
CPC above - the classic 
game by Paul Shirley, 
became the inadvertent 
inspiration behind 
Bullfrog's hit 'god game'.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
excited by the landscape 
demo. Somehow we quickly 
got it working on the Amiga. Almost 
thirty years on I'm a little fuzzy how 
this happened. If you stick to 16 colours 
while ignoring the copper and blitter, 
the Amiga is very similar to the ST. For 
the game code (all C) the machines are 
identical and the screen formats aren't 
that different. Somehow the demo was 
ported in a few days, probably with 
Kevin's help. All of the portable source 
code was kept portable - and so Populous 
was born. 
Sticking on the labels
Initially files were transferred between 
Amiga and ST via the null modem 
cable that we had previously been using 
to play Stunt Car Racer. We quickly 
moved to a bit of Amiga software called 
Dos2Dos which allowed the Amiga to 
read and write dos format disks which 
the ST could also access. Far quicker.
Peter started working on the game a 
week or so later. The entire development 
took only seven months. Peter and I 
were the only people working on it 
full time. He designed and coded the 
see 1/64th of 
the map at any 
given time. To fix this 
I knocked up an isometric map 
view and stuck it in the top left corner 
of the screen where it was safe from 
being obscured by the 8x8 isometric view 
in the bottom right (the exact same spot 
it had been in Spindizzy).
The map looked cool but wasn't 
making the world look any less like a 
bunch of intersecting pyramids so I set 
about writing the editor after all. It was 
pretty simple, you could basically scroll 
around with the joystick and make a 
bump go up and down in the centre of 
the 8x8 isometric view. At this point I'd 
been working on it for three days over a 
bank holiday weekend and had no idea 
what the hell it was supposed to be, I 
was just looking forward to showing it 
to people on the Tuesday morning.
On that Tuesday morning, Peter was 
still working on Taurus stuff, as he had 
been for several months but was very 
Populous - a mish 
mash of graphical 
pyramids that morphed 
into a game.

that has stupidly crept back up again 
with every Populous sequel or 'spiritual 
successor'.
This was all very cool but the game 
was still multiplayer only, so Peter 
switched his focus to writing a computer 
opponent that could beat me. The cool 
thing about this is that I know exactly 
how it worked because we basically 
'buddy coded' that side of the ai. I was 
gameplay while I programmed both 
versions of the graphic engine and drew 
all of the in-game graphics as well as 
handling the ST system specifics. Kevin 
helped Peter with some of the Amiga 
specifics while a couple of artists helped 
out with the fact that I couldn't seem to 
draw anything bigger than about 32x32 
pixels. They provided the load screen and 
the 'goblin lord' character that says 'well 
done mortal' when you win a level. His 
face inexplicably shows up in a lot of 
Amiga demos.
Somehow we decided to make the 
game multiplayer. I really don't know 
how that happened, it can't just have 
been just because that null modem cable 
was still strung between our machines. 
It was an interesting network model, 
the game only passed a few bytes of 
information per frame that described 
the player's actions. The downside of 
this approach was that you had to make 
the game entirely deterministic. The 
simulation has to stay entirely in sync 
between players, which is tough to do 
but saves a lot of bandwidth compared to 
one player being the host and sending all 
the info on where everything is.
At this point there was no playable 
single player game. Peter and I would 
typically work until about seven or eight 
pm and then stop to play the game 
multiplayer for a few hours. During this 
period we tried all sorts of weapon spells, 
people-production tunings and so on. 
It went from easily taking an hour to 
play down to 5-10 minutes, a number

multiplayer. I really don't know how 
that happened..."

course really just random number seeds. 
Each time you finished one you'd have 
a certain number of points and these 
would skip you through that number 
of levels. You'd then get a code which 
served as a save game but was basically 
just a seed with some sort of checksum. 
We basically ripped this off wholesale for 
Populous's conquest mode. I can't be sure 
but I suspect this is the only mode that 
ninety-five percent-plus of those who 
played it ever saw. If it hadn't have been 
there Populous would have been a cool 
curiosity, but I don't think many people 
would have actually played it.
Populous was an Amiga-first game 
but it went on to be released on at least 
sixteen formats including SNES where 
it was a launch title. My favourite thing 
about working on it was the way the 'flat 
land' became a resource and how good it 
felt to manipulate the landscape. I love 
the way that it happened organically. 
There was no design document stating 
how the landscape would work as a 
resource, this was all from a completely 
speculative experiment. 
At my smuggest I like to liken it to 
Rubik's cube. Erno Rubik wasn't trying 
sitting at my ST, getting the Fusion port 
through EA's QA which basically meant 
waiting around for a phone call while 
they looked for bugs. I sat there with my 
feet up watching and talking to Peter 
about every line of code he wrote. It's 
a great way to work. The main way the 
ai opponent worked was that it had a 
massive speed advantage. It could make 
a 'move' every single frame. If you sent 
a flood he could save fifty drowning 
people in two seconds. One of the main 
ways of tuning the ai was to stick a delay 
on its reactions. The hardest computer 
opponent setting was basically a super-
fast moron but it didn't feel like that 
while playing.
Now the game had two modes, 
multiplayer and custom mode where you 
got to set up your opponent. How fast 
is he? How many people does he start 
with? which spells can he and you use? 
It was fun but it still had something very 
important missing even though we were 
only weeks from release.
Luckily Joss Ellis was still our 
producer at EA and he'd worked on The 
Sentinel while at Firebird. In The Sentinel 
there were 10,000 levels which were of 
Popular Populous,

the Atari ST; cakeland

polygon renderer and was pretty fast 
considering that it worked with 16x16 
pixel dither patterns instead of flat 
colours. This meant that it looked very 
colourful, almost texture mapped. It 
also meant we could zoom in and out. 
The downside is that zoomed out, it 
was drawing several hundred polygons 
and the frame rate slowed to a crawl. 
I couldn't even use the Amiga's extra 
hardware to help out because at this 
point the polygons were tiny on screen 
and the smaller something is on screen, 
the less point there is asking the blitter 
to draw it for you.
Personally, I didn't like the gameplay 
of Powermonger, it was too fiddly, too 
slow, too boring and not as much fun 
to make a puzzle when he made the first 
cube prototype. He wasn't attempting 
to build something specified by a great 
puzzle designer and run through focus 
groups. He was just fascinated with the 
engineering problem of keeping those 
corners and edges attached. He later 
put stickers on it and found he'd created 
the best puzzle of its type ever. It feels 
like it was somehow there waiting to be 
discovered. Is it hyperbole to compare 
Populous to this? Probably. There's also a 
possibility that I'm trying to imply that, 
in this analogy at least, Peter is just the 
bloke who put the stickers on.
Making the engine work hard
In contrast Powermonger wasn't a 
speculative development at all. Peter 
wanted to do a war game with more 
direct control over groups of troops, 
I wanted to update the technology. I 
experimented with a double-density, 
less limited version of the Populous 
engine. The blocks were half the size and 
there were two different slopes instead 
of one but I got bored and decided I 
wanted to learn 3D. I was quite proud 
of Powermonger's tech. It was my first

importance by this point. It was very 
much aimed at Amiga first. The blitter 
was used extensively, the palette was 
freed from being ST compatible, the 
game was playable full screen. It also 
featured a year of work by two great 
artists (Paul McLaughlan and Gary 
Carr) while the original had taken 
maybe a month in total of me taking 
breaks from coding.
The game was better in every way, 
it had 36 spells and effects rather than 
the original six. Some of these were 
mad, like swamps that obey the rules 
of Conway's Life and 'fonts' that cause 
characters to change side. To be honest, 
I found it a little too confusing to play 
or maybe I'm a narcissist or maybe I was 
just itching to start playing with the PC 
but I was never quite as into the sequel.
Syndicate had a very weird history. 
It actually started out as a four-window 
strategy platform thing that somehow 
got sidetracked into Flood. After Flood 
Sean Cooper went back to it. It was 
still going to be about four separate 
characters but at some point I'd shown 
Sean an experiment I'd been working 
on. Back when I started on Populous I'd 
been attempting to do what Spinndizzy 
to work on as Populous had been. It also 
almost drove Peter mad. I did a lot of 
my groundwork on it while Peter was 
handling the PC port of Populous.
The game was released just before 
Christmas in 1990 even though we were 
still working on it in early December. 
EA really rushed it through QA but they 
kind of had to because it had more UK 
preorders than anything they'd released 
before. Powermonger is a weird game, I'm 
always a little incredulous when someone 
tells me that they loved it and played it 
to death.
Flood was being developed by 
Sean Cooper (who had been involved 
as a tester and artist on the Populous 
data-disk) while I was working on 
Powermonger. My involvement was 
mostly just the ST port but I did have a 
little other input. Most notably all of the 
single screen wide levels were mine. This 
was largely because the ST was so bad at 
horizontal scrolling.
Populous II development was rather 
different from the original. The ST and 
Amiga had switched place in terms of

saying 'no' I suggested 'maybe on CD32', 
a machine I didn't really know anything 
about beyond the fact that it sort of had

an Amiga forum about it. Even when I

had done on the 8-bits but, thanks to 
the extra power of the 16-bit machines, 
I'd been able to brute-force 8x8 
isometric blocks onto the screen. At 
some point around the time I started on 
Powermonger I'd also written my take 
on how a 'partial screen-space update' 
isometric engine would work. I'd shown 
this to Sean. He set about writing this 
for the pc where it became the basis of 
Syndicate and much later, the basis of 
a Flash player-based engine that was 
pretty successful in the early days of 
Facebook gaming. It also got ported 
to Amiga by Mike Diskett (with help 
from Mark Lamport I think) as by then 
Bullfrog's main focus had switched to 
pc. They did an amazing job though; full 
support for the Amiga 1200, I believe, 
though I wasn't really paying attention as 
I was playing with that lovely 256-colour 
mode on pc.
Theme Park was another port from 
the pc by Disky and Mark. This one was 
even more impressive than Syndicate as 
the pc version was in 256 colours. I really 
had very little to do with this as I hadn't 
even worked on the pc original.
 Magic Carpet was never even planned 
for the Amiga though googling 'Magic 
Carpet Amiga' suggests otherwise. This is 
because the Amiga press had always been 
good to Bullfrog. At some point while 
promoting Syndicate or Theme Park we 
had a visit from CU Amiga magazine and, 
while touring the office, someone saw an 
early version of Magic Carpet. They asked 
if it would come to Amiga. Instead of

at their capabilities and then having 
to downgrade everything to whatever 
conversion you were on did put one's 
teeth on edge at times.
So one morning, while mulling 
over my decision for Steve I attended 
an informal get-together of the 
development staff in the basement of 
Ocean, Central Street.
What we discussed I cannot 
recall, but I do remember vividly 
that Gary Bracey, once finished with 
whatever news he was giving us asked 
if anyone had any questions. I leapt 
at the opportunity and asked when 
Ocean would be graduating to 16-bit 
machines. His reply was that he could 
state categorically that Ocean had no 
immediate plans for moving away from 
I 
had actually left Ocean when the 
transition to the 16-bit machines took 
place. In fact, it was Ocean's hesitation to 
make the move that caused me to leave 
in the first place.
I'd started work on the Commodore 
version of RoboCop when my old friend 
Steve Cain approached me. He told 
me that he was putting together a 
small company developing for Arc, the 
publishing arm of Atari. He said that I 
would be working on the Atari ST and 
Amiga. 
I can't honestly say that I had lain 
awake at nights dreaming of the 16-bit 
machines but I must admit that the 
restrictions of 8-bits had begun to pall 
more than somewhat. Seeing the arcade 
machines rolling in and marvelling 
Simon Butler
Starting out on the Atari ST, Simon soon applied his 
graphic design skills to games on the Amiga, 
including many high-profile titles such as 
Ocean Software's Total Recall.
The somewhat shiny 
Ocean logo - much 
redesigned from its 
original incarnation.

My next encounter with the 
Amiga was the infamous episode 
with the laughingly named Active 
Minds and their Total Recall licence. 
I did the graphics for Gazza 2 while 
simultaneously attempting to salvage the 
abomination they had created to date.
Once that debacle was out of the way, 
I was back at Ocean and this was really 
when the Amiga figured prominently in 
my career.
There are others who would be able 
to trot out exact dates of when and what 
their current line of 8-bit development. 
It really was a no-brainer; I went to 
my desk, composed myself and then 
tracked down Gary so I could tender my 
immediate resignation.
So ended my first stint as an in-
house employee with Ocean. I was off to 
greener pastures. Silly me. 
I can't speak for Ocean's transition 
to the 16-bit machines, they made that 
move during my absence. I went straight 
from 8-bit to a nice shiny Atari ST 
while my Amiga sat gathering dust on 
someone else's desk.
All of my graphics for my Amiga 
titles while away from Ocean were 
developed for the most part on the Atari 
ST and then simply ported across. What 
an exciting anecdote! But I did have my 
name on at least four Amiga titles at that 
point. 
The only real exception to this was 
an abortive and thankfully unreleased 
version of Manic Miner for which I 
was contracted to create the graphics. 
The coder - and I use the term 
exceptionally loosely - didn't want sprites 
and background graphics; he wanted 
background graphics that were to be 
animated, as I was supposed to draw 
every sprite animating in every version of 
the background tiles. That didn't happen 
and I skipped away from that particular 
trainwreck as fast as humanly possible.
But as painful as that experience 
was at least it meant I did spend some 
quality time actually working hands-on 
with an Amiga for once.
Total Recall - Simon 
was literally parachuted 
in to save this game 
from the 'bin'.
The manager options 
screen from Gazza II - 
the in-game overhead 
view was a simple one.

they were, wouldn't allow that to 
happen without slapping a licence on 
it, combined with a barrel-load of size 
and graphic restrictions from Universal 
Studios regarding their characters.
It wasn't long before the entire 
project spiralled horrendously out of 
control and rather than throw our hands 
up in surrender we soldiered on for what 
seemed like forever until the plug was 
finally pulled.
 After that I did have titles converted 
across to the Amiga so I'm proud to say 
that my graphics in The Addams Family 
look as good there as they did on the 
SNES, but Dennis the Menace is a project 
I'd just as soon forget for a wide variety 
of reasons.
Just one of those machines
My association with the Amiga ended 
with my departure from Ocean for the 
second and final time, but I have had 
a series of titles released since 2010 
by Retroguru on a staggering array of 
machines which includes the Amiga 500.
The tool of choice for the Amiga was 
obviously the incredibly powerful and 
versatile Deluxe Paint. I can't remember 
what version I used, but I do remember 
other Amiga artists waxing lyrical about 
various new doodads and tricks that each 
new version could perform.
I was simply workman-like with 
my graphics and for me if I knew the 
basics of something I never delved any 
deeper just in case I got myself lost in 
technology. Not quite a Luddite, but less 
they were doing at any given point in 
those days at Ocean but for me  - after 
so many years and so many more titles - 
I just struggle to remember what I had 
for breakfast today.
I do know that during my second 
stint at Ocean I did Army Moves, then 
some static bitmaps on Elf, followed by 
character design and animation on the 
main character in Pushover.
Then I spent a 
massive chunk of my 
career working on the 
nightmare that was 
Universal Monsters. 
That was supposed 
to be an original 
title and the premise 
was basically a really 
cutesy, fun, isometric spooky adventure 
influenced heavily by Knight Lore.

but I just never warmed to it.
Strange really, I couldn't explain why 
if you held me at gunpoint and to do 
that you'd have to get to the back of an 
exceptionally long queue.
To me it's just one of those machines 
I worked on during my career but it's not 
got that warm fuzzy special place that 
some of the others have attained.
I fully understand why it is held in 
such high regard when I think back to 
the titles that were released at the time 
and even today when I see pixel 
art created by Amiga fans, it just 
hurts my head to see what talent 
exists and how they are pushing 
the Amiga even now.
It fully deserves its place in the 
pantheon of gaming machines, 
I'm glad it crossed my path and 
I realise that without the Amiga 
my career would probably have 
stalled decades since. For that I 
am truly grateful.

served me best.
I must honestly say that while I did 
have games converted across to the 
Amiga, and while I also spent a fair 
period of my time working hands-on 
with the Amiga I was never a true fan 
compared to those who went weak at the 
knees at the very mention of its name.

found it easy to use, it was far more user

online soccer game as well as forming the 
world's first digital games federation. I'm 
now back in the UK and recently setup 
Pixel Age Studios with Raffaele Cecco.
My involvement with Amiga started 
at Vivid Image, our first two games 
Hammerfist and Time Machine were 
developed on the Amiga as the lead 
machine. Commodore launched the 
Amiga more as a business computer 
than a games machine. It was games like 
Shadow of the Beast, Turrican, Stunt Car 
Racer, and First Samurai that defined it 
as a great computer games platform.
When we set up Vivid Image 
Developments I wanted to start with 
a very ambitious game that would be 
better and bigger than Last Ninja 2. 
But it was decided that we should start 
M
y involvement with games was 
by complete chance as was 
my coming and living in England. I 
started programming on the 8-bit home 
computers (ZX Spectrum), creating a 
string of successful games including 
Enduro Racer, Last Ninja 2, First 
Samurai and Street Racer. After finishing 
Last Ninja 2 my intention was to setup 
my own studio, which I did with John 
Twiddy and Hugh Riley and formed 
Vivid Image Developments.
At the end of 2000 I went to my 
native country of Turkey to kick start the 
gaming sector. More success followed 
there with Turkey's first and biggest 
mmorpg†, the world's first 11 vs 11 
Time Machine for the 
Amiga, converted to 
the Spectrum, right, 
and Amstrad CPC by 
Raffaele Cecco.

role-playing game
Mevlut Dinc

Though developing a number of games for the Amiga, he is 
best known for First Samurai, a game he believes to be one 
of the most pirated for the system due to its short shelf life.

contributed to the game. There are many 
aspects to First Samurai that made it 
unique; it was technically superb in every 
way, coupled with amazing graphics, 
fantastic sound effects and gameplay.
I also think the sheer size of the 
game and many different elements of 
gameplay surprised a lot of people; there 
was hand-to-hand and armed fighting, 
arcade adventure, many puzzles and very 
unique end-of-level bosses.
I did admit this before but it's 
probably worth mentioning it again that 
the actual levels were probably too big, 
maybe each level should have been split 
into four sublevels, or so.
with a completely different and original 
title as our first game. I went along 
with the decision, which resulted in 
Hammerfist. Although it was really great 
both technically and visually I did not 
feel that it truly captured what we could 
do. Our second game Time Machine was 
indeed very original and cleverly done 
to fit on the A500. Raff Cecco is one of 
the great British game developers and 
I always wanted to work with him. I 
convinced him to do the Spectrum and 
Amstrad versions of Time Machine.
I still wanted to develop a great 
combat arcade adventure, which also 
took full advantage of the Amiga. Since 
we couldn't really do another ninja 
game I thought of doing a samurai 
game instead. And, I also thought First 
Samurai would be a good title instead of 
Last something. Both the title and the 
fact of doing a samurai game got people 
talking, making possible comparisons 
with Last Ninja. So, we started getting 
good publicity very early on.
We had a five-year contract with 
Activision but in 1990 they ran into some 
problems, which resulted in us signing 
a deal with Mirrorsoft to publish First 
Samurai. I managed to convince Raffaele 
to work with us on First Samurai, and 
I must say that a lot of the credit must 
go to his excellent programming, not of 
course forgetting the amazing graphics by 
Teoman Irmak; as far as I am concerned 
First Samurai graphics have to be some 
of the very best on the Amiga.
We all worked very hard and 
Humanoid holograms go 
on the rampage against 
Centro-Holographix in 
1990's Hammerfist.
Due to unfortunate 
circumstances, First 
Samurai was only on 
the shop shelves for a 
week and yet the game 
has become a classic.

animations before handing them to Raff. 
I think we kept working on the editor 
right until the end of development of the 
game itself! John Twiddy did a great job 
on the editor.
One other thing that I'm very proud 
of is the sky effect in the game. Amiga 
had amazing hardware and with the 
copper you can change the colour of 
every pixel vertically with a resolution 
of 16 gradients for each colour. We had 
written an editor to create many different 
and nice looking sky colour patterns. No 
matter what I did I could not get rid of 
the nasty colour change between each 
of the 16 colour blocks! But, I never 
easily give up, I cannot remember how 
long I tried but I accidently discovered 
a combination that worked, and the 
skyline just looked amazing. I am sure a 
lot of people must have wondered what 
clever programming tricks we used to 
get that effect but I can reveal now that 
it was just endless experimenting and 
patience!
First Samurai was released in 1991 
and was voted Game of the Year. 
However, with the death of Robert 
Maxwell and the demise of Mirrorsoft 
the game was only on the shelves 
for one week. It was probably one of 
the most copied games ever, because 
people couldn't buy the game, they 
simply exchanged disks in the school 
playground. I know this because at the 
time the help lines were receiving more 
calls on First Samurai than any other 
game!
                    
To me there are many highlights to 
the game. The title music is probably 
one of the best game tunes ever! Many 
musicians sent us tunes but I chose one 
composed by 16-year-old Michael Davis 
(I hope I remembered the name right). 
Raff sampled a lot of sound effects 
from rock and classic CDs for testing 
purposes until the actual fx were ready 
and they sounded very good. Oh no my 
sword! is the voice of Raff! Of course, my 
favourite is Hallelujah!
Our good friend Nick Jones, another 
great British programmer, did the in-
game music. I tried many things with the 
sound driver to enable us to use multiple 
sound fx while the music was playing.
The graphics and all the visual effects 
in First Samurai were groundbreaking 
in many ways. We worked hard to make 
it easy for the artists to create and test 
all the graphics and also for Raff to use 
them in the game efficiently and easily.
We designed and developed a game 
editor specifically for the First Samurai; 
Teoman could test all the graphics 
including the backgrounds, effects and 
The beautifully 
graduated sky is only 
one of First Samurai's 
graphic treats.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
SideWinder - a pretty 
decent scrolling shoot-
em-up made all the 
better by a soundtrack 
from David Whittaker.
Amiga would come along.
David was not just a musician but a 
programmer as well, and this gave him 
a huge advantage over the competition, 
especially in the early days, as he was 
able to quickly build a custom sound 
driver capable of playing back, not only 
samples but real time synthesiser sounds 
T
he Commodore Amiga was 
groundbreaking for its sound 
capabilities. Before the Amiga we were 
limited to the simple bleeps of the ZX 
Spectrum and analogue synthesis on the 
Commodore 64 with the occasional poor 
quality sample, but here for the first time 
we had four channels of 8-bit 29kHz 
sampled sound, previously only possible 
on hardware such as the Fairlight 
synthesiser, costing many thousands of 
pounds. 
Pioneering game composer and 
programmer David Whittaker was 
already responsible for many memorable 
soundtracks on the Spectrum and C64 
such as Glider Rider, The Magic Knight 
trilogy and Lazy Jones, and ever since 
hearing synths such as the Fairlight and 
sampled music from the likes of Peter 
Gabriel and Depeche Mode, had been 
hoping that a development such as the 
Allister Brimble on David Whittaker
With a list of titles credited to his name such as 
Alien Breed and Superfrog, here Allister takes a look back 
at the talent that is David Whittaker, a composer so in 
demand in the 1980s and early 1990s that the overflow 
benefited other music writers. 
"I was allowed to use a ton of sample/
music memory/disk-space by Psygnosis, 
so I really went to town."

top-flight game studios.

as well, which took none of the Amiga's 
precious ram. Many of the techniques 
he had used in the 8-bit days such as real 
time vibrato, arpeggios and echoes were 
often applied to samples and his real-
time generated bass lines were cleaner 
than any sample could ever be. Other 
music in the early days of the Amiga 
was grainy and lo-fi as games didn't have 
much ram or disk space available but 
David's music, due to his compact synth 
sounds and clever sample manipulation, 
sounded fresh and clean. 
'I always composed on a separate synth 
(like the Jupiter 6, CX5M or M1) and 
manually entered each note by hand, into 
an assembler file of my drivers. Luckily, 
the note format I used was compatible 
across most platforms (C64/Spectrum/
ST/Amiga/pc/etc.), so cut'n'pasting those 
saved a ton of reworking. As most people 
know, I also reused a lot of my samples, 
regularly, as getting those was a big job, 
and people asked for them specifically, 
which was fine by me.'
David's actual compositions were, 
by his own admission, simple, but their 
simplicity made them catchy, fitting, 
and the overall sound quality was just 
amazing; some are even rumoured to 
have been reused by major pop artists! 
Early games such as SideWinder showed 
promise with heavily manipulated 
electric guitar and powerful drums. It 
was impressive at the time, but then 
came the ground breaking, Shadow Of 
The Beast with vividly clear pan flutes, 
choir and percussion which fast became 
the benchmark for all Amiga music yet 
to come, most of it failing to reach the 
same standard!
'I was allowed to use a ton of (by the 
standards of the time) sample/music 
memory/disk-space by Psygnosis, so I

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
My second was a HESmon cartridge, 
which allowed me to get into machine 
language. I quickly found that once I 
abandoned basic and took direct control 
of the machine, I could do things that 
I wasn't seeing in the magazines.  I 
decided to write a shooting game based 
on the classic sci-fi film Earth vs The 
Flying Saucers (1956). I drew a giant 
illustration of Washington DC on graph 
paper, with each square representing a 
pixel on the screen. It took several weeks 
to transfer these thousands of dots to the 
computer one hexadecimal number 
at a time, but when I finally saw it 
on the screen I knew I was looking 
at a level of detail that no C64 had 
ever displayed before. I completed 
the game and sold it by mail-order 
on floppy disks. Saucer Attack did 
fairly well and got positive reviews in the 
magazines. 
For my second effort, I decided to  
try something even more ambitious - a 
time-travel game in which the player 
must traverse different eras in order 
to find pieces of the shattered crystal 
which powers his time machine.  But 
I 
got into computers in 1982 at the 
relatively advanced age of thirty-three, 
after having served in the Air Force as a 
pilot. I had always tried to keep up with 
technology, and I couldn't help feeling 
a bit left out when I heard kids talking 
about bits and bytes. So I decided to buy 
a Commodore 64 and see what all the 
buzz was about.
As soon as I took it out of the box, 
I was hooked.  I spent a couple 
of weeks typing in programs 
from Commodore magazines 
- endless pages of numbers 
separated by commas. On the 
rare occasion when I got all the numbers 
right, I'd be rewarded by some little 
Lunar Lander or Centipede game.
Having no storage device, I lost 
everything when I turned the machine 
off. My first peripheral was a tape drive.

Instead of C64 User Groups, I was 
now going to Amiga meetings and 
sharing my newfound knowledge by 
giving away artwork on slideshow disks. 
Copies of these soon became widespread, 
and attracted the attention of game 
developers. I was contacted by Bob Jacob 
of Cinemaware to provide the graphics 
for a new type of computer game with 
the look and feel of a movie. Designed 
by Kellyn Beeck and programmed by 
RJ Mical, Defender of the Crown was 
the first product to really show off the 
after working on the game for a year, it 
became obvious that rampant piracy in 
the C64 world would never allow me 
to earn a decent living in that market. 
Anyway, there was a much more exciting 
Commodore machine on the horizon -
the Amiga. So I abandoned Time Crystal 
and gave away the only completed 
scene at user group meetings. It's still 
considered by many to be the ultimate 
demonstration of the C64's limits.

officials to ask for developer status. It was 
granted on the strength of my C64 work.
I set to work exploring the machine's

Those were indescribably exciting days. 
I couldn't wait to get up each morning,

Amiga's awesome capabilities. It went 
on to become the most ported game in 
history, but no other machine was ever 
able to match the look of the Amiga

games after that, including Ports of Call, 
Centurian: Defender of Rome, and Who

balanced on a box at one end and a 
fish tank at the other. On this most 
precarious of surfaces sat an Amiga. It 
was an old A1000, its surface stained 
yellow-brown from nicotine and packing 
tape held its expanded memory in 
place. It didn't have a hard drive. It 
was the only machine in the office that 
still required the Kickstart disk. If you 
nudged the desk the wrong 
way, it would reboot itself.
I did manage to snag a 
lovely Naksha mouse for it 
though, so that's something.
It was also hooked up 
to an ntsc monitor, which 
meant that trying to play 
a pal game on it meant 
losing the bottom part of the 
screen. As a result, games 
of Kick Off 2 were massively 
imbalanced because whoever 
was shooting down the screen couldn't 
actually see the goal.

But I looked into it in a bit more depth 
and decided that the Amiga was the way 
to go. I'm glad I did. I didn't need it for 
the midi port - I needed it to play games 
on and the games just seemed to be 
better on the Amiga.

think he'd ever played against anyone so 
mechanical as me. Someone who was 
prepared to do monotonous things over 
and over to grind an opponent down 
and claim the victory rather than go for 
a more entertaining but riskier strategy. 
That said, this is several years before 
Robbo turned up on the scene and I 
have little or no doubt that he took this 
particular crown.
Bullfrog's methodology was always 
to build the game for multiplayer to start 
with. That meant that you could easily 
test systems without having to wait for 
an ai to be written. It was also very easy 
to tweak playing styles on the fly to find 
out what worked and what didn't. Once 
we'd got that bit right, it was then just a 
case of making an ai that would try to 
use the same tactics as we had.
It also meant that we were forever 
on the search for Amigas that still had 
Corpes's built-in editor and I'd get to 
work -175 of them; 193 additional levels 
for the data disk too.
Everyone else had A2000s - and 
Glenn, as the self-styled Atari converter,  
had an ST too. Eventually, I got an 
upgrade: an A500 whose expanded 
memory actually fitted on board in 
the prescribed position. To top it all, it 
came with a whopping 20mb of external 
hard drive space and a working serial 
port. This enabled us to develop the 
multiplayer game for Populous II. Again, 
there was no network - builds were still 
passed around on 3.5-inch floppies. 
Multiplayer games were conducted over 
serial cables.
I'd play against Peter - our chairs 
backed into each other. The gameplay 
was very emergent - no two games were 
the same and each time I came up with 
a winning strategy, Peter would rewrite 
the code, change the balance and we'd

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
My personal favourite was a game 
called Biosphere that was being developed 
out-of-house by an American called 
Richard Reed. It had a hex-based height 
field and these cute little alien dudes 
who would land on a planet and try to 
terraform it to order, ensuring that it 
had the right amount of flora and fauna, 
and trying not to die in the process. 
He would ultimately get hired and, 
after many, many redesigns, that game 
would eventually come out for dos and 
Windows as Genewars.
Sean was working on Cyber Assault, 
a project that later emerged as Syndicate. 
Simon had done a bunch of sprites for 
it and Paul was busy making concept art 
in Deluxe Paint. (That and introducing 
me to the wonders of Sculpt 4D and 
the soul-crushing despair that only 
comes from leaving a render running 
overnight only to return in the morning 
and discover that you didn't enable the 
lights...) I loved dabbling with the art 
side of things.
There was just something so very 
satisfying about pixel pushing. In Paul 
and Gary I was learning from the best 
too. I would never call myself an artist 
- much as I don't refer to myself as a 
coder these days - but there was a tiny 
piece of my artwork in everything from 
Powermonger all the way up to Gene 
Wars.

I miss most about those Amiga days it

were fragile.
Peter was also a dab hand at Stunt 
Car Racer. In fact - original Populous 
aside - that remains the only game I 
could never beat him at. I think I was 
also unreasonably excited when Lotus 
Challenge 2 came out and we were able 
to play four-player on two machines.
The desk was as precarious as ever.
As well as the big games, there were 
several other side projects that people 
were working on. Kevin had a thing 
called 256 which was a top-down, 
rotational shooter inspired by the likes 
of Assault 360 (the 256 being derived 
from the number of distinct 'degrees' of 
rotation the game actually supported). 
Glenn was, of course, working on many 
different ways of making landscapes.
Alex designed many of 
the levels in Syndicate.
Biosphere eventually

68000 assembly code using an assembler 
called K-Seka. In its way this was a 
good thing; because the ST relies on the 
processor more I had to learn how to 
optimise to get the best performance out 
of the cpu.
When it came out the A500 was 
more affordable and so I got one. I 
bought the hardware manuals and 
started to figure the machine out. The 
hardware's similarity to the Atari 800 
amazed me - just generations ahead.
By this time I had started 
programming the NES for Zippo Games 
in Manchester (eventually Rare North). 
The NES had a cut-down 6502 (similar 
to the cpu in the Atari 800), but after 
work I would try to figure out more 
tricks to do with the Amiga and ST 
hardware.
At Zippo industry veteran John 
Pickford told me about the idea he had 
I 
first read about the Amiga in an issue 
of Byte magazine in the early 1980s in 
a paragraph of a rumour section about 
a 32-bit computer using the Motorola 
68000 chip. The first time I saw an 
Amiga was in 1986.
I had an Atari 800 at the time 
and attended a local computer club 
in Preston called pace and one of 
the members had just imported an 
A1000. The graphics really impressed 
me compared to what I was used to. 
Over time I saw things like the perfect 
conversion of Marble Madness and other 
arcade hits. I really wanted an Amiga 
but at the time it was too expensive, so 
I bought an Atari ST and taught myself 
Anthony Ball
After seeing near-perfect conversions of arcade hits on the 
Amiga, Anthony realised he needed to swap over from his 
Atari ST, which eventually led him first to Zippo and then 
Tiertex, where he coded hits such as Cabal and Mercs.
Scrolling through

memory saving idea

and his brother Ste

up Zippo Games, intent 
on producing original 
quality 16-bit titles. 

for scrolling in Cosmic Pirate on 
the Amiga. He showed that you 
only needed to update the sides 
of the screen when scrolling left or right 
and so you could let the screen scroll 
through memory. This way one extra 
whole screen of scrolling only took one 
extra line of memory. At Zippo I used 
to transfer code from a pc to the NES 
using a transfer cable, which speeded up 
development time considerably. 
I eventually left Zippo to work for 
Tiertex.  Initially I created new copy 
protections. The Amiga A500 had a 
master clock input on the video port 
so that it could sync with a GenLock 
device. I figured out that by supplying 
that clock with a slightly faster than 
normal clock I could speed up the whole 
computer slightly. By doing this I would 
make the bit cell size when writing to 
disks a little smaller, allowing for more 
information to fit on a track. This made 
the disks impossible to copy using 
standard hardware. Donald Campbell, 
one of Tiertex's owners, was an expert 
with micro electronics and helped me 
get it to work.
At Tiertex I wrote Mercs for both 
Amiga and ST.  The Amiga version 
was the primary version although both

having to redraw the entire screen or use 
up a lot of memory.) I also thought of 
an idea to reuse hardware sprites as the 
screen is being drawn to create a whole 
16-colour screen background. I made a 
demo and showed it to my friends Andy 
Ingram and Jon Burton, who later used 
the technique for the mountains in the 
background of the first Travellers Tales 
game Leander.
Together with David Bland I decided 
to leave Tiertex to create an original 
game, Superhero.  In this I wanted to 
employ all the tricks I'd figured out over 
the years. The game had 8-way 60Hz 
scrolling, an overlaid panel, huge enemy 
sprites, a 32k background colour palette 
(normally the Amiga can only display 4k 
colours), and 16 colour on 16 colour and 
blitter scaling front end demo effects. 
Then just before release I was arrested 
for hacking BSkyB! [later just Sky] The 
police took all my computers and refused 
to give them back. I was eventually 
cleared, but by then seven years had 
almost passed and the Amiga wasn't that 
popular anymore.
machines shared the same graphics.  
However, the Amiga version had some 
advantages over the ST, for instance 
better scrolling and a screen overlay for 
the panel. On the Amiga I followed a 
similar programming method to the 
one I used at Zippo with the NES. 
I assembled on one Amiga and then 
transferred the code via a cable to a 
second Amiga.
While I was at Tiertex I kept 
working on new ways to take advantage 
of the Amiga's hardware. I enhanced 
John Pickford's idea to scroll though 
memory by using a copper list to create 
a barrel scroll, so then I only needed 
to update the top, bottom, left- and 
right-hand sides of the screen to make a 
fullscreen scroller. (Normally it required

enough to be one of them.
It is imperative to note that up until 
this point, the only way to put music in 
a game was with a music driver. There 
were a couple of commercial packages 
on the market, but these were not really 
viable because they used up too much 
of the valuable resources. The C64 only 
had 64k ram, so every little bit counted. 
Ninety-nine per cent of the music in 
games used their own custom music 
driver. These were closely 
guarded secrets, as people 
found ways to squeeze more 
and more out of the hardware 
over time. 
My Amiga came with 
a copy of Soundtracker, the 
music composition software. 
This changed everything as 
it completely levelled the 
playing field for composers. 
Previously you had to depend 
on that music driver's technical 
capabilities to make your 
music sound better. Now we

can't honestly remember when I 
saw my first Amiga in action, but I 
remember being amazed at the graphics.  
It wasn't until early 1988 when I 
managed to borrow one for a week or 
two. By that time I was working as a full 
time composer for Catalyst Coders in 
Portsmouth, having previously worked 
freelance on a few Commodore 64 
games. I was seventeen at the time. 
There weren't many full time professional 
games composers at this time. Probably 
Barry Leitch
Now making music for chidren's toys, Barry is 
associated with many memorable soundtracks which 
accompanied top-selling Amiga titles in the early 1990s, 
from Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 to Xenophobe.

stride as a composer and wrote music 
that wasn't completely awful. I was living 
every game composer's dream.
Almost every game I worked on was 
a Top 10 hit. Many went straight to the 
number one slot. Imagitec subcontracted 
me to other publishers as well so I ended 
up doing conversions of many other 
companies' games to different platforms. 
There was a point when the top three 
games in the charts featured my music. 
I even started writing on the side for 
other software companies. And it was all

instruments, stereo, and up to 512k 
of memory! If someone created an 
instrument sample that you wanted to 
use, you could simply hack out their 
sample and use it. Everyone suddenly 
had access to everyone else's instruments. 
It took the creative power from the 
programmer's hands, and turned it over 
to the composers themselves. 
Immediately I started using 
Soundtracker as my compositional tool. 
It was so quick and intuitive to write 
music with it. To this day I compose in 
tracker-based systems (Renoise is just 
unbelievably brilliant).
Fast forward a couple of years, and 
I was working at Imagitec Design. 
Imagitec were the biggest software 
developer in the UK at the time, and 
very possibly the world. There were 
now probably about fifteen full time 
composers working in the game industry 
in the UK. I was lucky enough to be in 
the right place at the right time, and for 
a period of a year or so I got to work on 
not only all of Imagitec's games, but also 
all of Gremlin Graphics' titles.
This was a key time in British 
games development. Gremlin were 
going from strength to strength, and 
making absolutely brilliant games. As 
a composer, I'll be the first to admit, I 
don't think I'm the best composer in 
the world. I still cringe when I listen 
to most of my earlier work, but right 
around the time when I took on doing 
all of Gremlin Graphics' music as well 
as Imagitec's, I finally started to hit my

record it hundreds of times because four 
Amigas won't stay in sync even if you 
click play at the same time.

Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 - the idea for 
that tune came to me in a dream. I'd 
gone to bed thinking about what kind of 
music I wanted to write for it and woke 
up with that tune in my head.
Utopia - magazines reviewed the 
game before we'd shipped it. We had 
plans to do an interactive soundtrack but 
quickly gave up that idea. The magazine 
I'm thinking of talked about how the 
music had the death march in one of the

I'd better put it in.

Hastings - the program that would later 
evolve to Lightwave 3D, which is still 
around. With that, you could build 3D 
models (in a text editor!) and animate 
them. Of course, these models were just 
flat geometry without any textures - but 
it opened up a completely new world. 
Unfortunately it needed a lot of render 
power, which I didn´t have at that time 
(specifically ram). So I went to the local 
computer store and used their brand new 
Amiga 2000 to render stuff. 
Apart from renders, I always wanted 
to create my own Star Trek game, where 
I could explore the galaxy. So that's 
what I did. Early on, before getting into 
rendering or raytracing, all the game 
graphics were done in Deluxe Paint.  I 
tried to pack everything in that little 
program: standard flying, delivering 
things, fights with Klingons, ion storms,

y first computer was an 
Amiga 1000 in 1988, right 
after graduation. I bought it with my 
own money and a little help from my 
grandparents. I had seen it in a shop 
window on my way home almost every 
day. Most of my friends had a C64, so I 
was already familiar with Commodore. 
In school, we worked on Apple IIe, so I 
knew a thing or two about computers as 
well - and this seemed to be the perfect 
fit for me as I was interested in graphics.
Unfortunately, after setting up the 
computer I noticed that you could 
do almost nothing with it with the 
basic 256k ram configuration. So next 
morning, I went to the shop and bought 
the 256k ram extension for another 
insane amount of money. But finally, I 
could do something with this wondrous 
machine.
I started working with Deluxe Paint, 
painting pictures of my favourite subjects 
(mostly sci-fi related) and programmed 
little things when I started studying 
computer science at the nearby university. 
About a year after that I got my first 
3D program, VideoScape 3D by Allen

A big fan of science-fiction, Tobias used his mastery of the 
Amiga to create fantastic imagery of the Star Trek and Star

I was limited by the computer and my 
own programming capabilities - as I 
was always more the graphics guy. Still, 
I managed to finish the game and it 
became rather popular - I still get notes 
occasionally from people that played it 
back then. 
Moving on to the rendering world 
- my first 3D Enterprise was done in 
Videoscape - with 1000 points (as this 
was the maximum the program could 
handle), each edited with a text editor 
and painstakingly planned ahead on 
metric graph paper. Since Videoscape 
could only do flat polygons, this was a 
nice first step, but it wasn't so convincing 
visually.
That changed when the first raytracing 
programs came out. Mostly I used the 
German program Reflections, which could 
handle more realistic renders. With it I 
built a new Enterprise and lots of other 
stuff. Sometimes these small images took 
over a day to render for just one frame. 
Almost all of my renders had something 
to do with sci-fi - be it Star Trek or Star 
Wars. I probably created even more Star 
Wars models back then.
 I got to know the programmer of 
Reflections rather well and suggested 
some improvements and additions; I 
even wrote a workshop book on how to 
use the application. When Reflections 
finally added an animation function I 
was able to put my models into motion

and is still known today, while the 
other smaller games we did after have 
been forgotten (perhaps not such a bad 
thing?) - so I am still proud of what we 
did back then.
I also started getting into the world 
of cutscenes and intros, for example with 
the rendered intro for Alien Breed. The 
most sophisticated work I did then was 
for the intro of another British sci-fi 
game, but sadly it was cancelled after 
months of development.
 During that time, I made contact 
with a German tv producer in Cologne, 
which was around 200km away from 
where I was studying. They were using 
Amigas in their productions (tv and 
events), so I went to work for them for 
a couple of weeks during the summer 
and finally, on completing my studies, I 
moved to Cologne full time.
By then, we were utilising writeable 
laser discs to record pictures in 24-bit 
frame by frame off the Amiga - quite 
sophisticated for the time. We did 
graphics for the German version of 
Spitting Image and a children's show 
called Romeo, which was about a blue 
alien living on a ship in orbit around 
started buying more Amigas in order to 
handle the workload - first an A2000, 
later A3000, A4000 and A4000T.
As so often is the case, getting 
involved in games creation was a happy 
accident. A couple of my fellow students 
came up with the idea of creating a 
game during our studying time. One of 
them knew a publisher.  As this was the 
'golden age' of computer games, there 
was high demand, so we quickly reached 
a deal with the publisher for our first 
game, Oil Imperium. That was a classic 
'German' business simulation, but with 
some action elements.
I provided all the artwork for 
the game, while my friends were 
programming it. It was pretty successful

the earth. While the alien was a puppet, 
all the exterior shots and the intro were 
digitally produced with the Amiga. 
I always remember that time fondly, 
because the production was in a big 
warehouse, with all departments - 
puppet manufacture, set building, stages, 
our computer lab - all under one roof.

played for hours.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
one right away when Commodore 
launched the A1000 since it was very 
expensive - and I was only a lad in his 
early teens. Oddly, I can't actually recall 
exactly why I chose Amiga when the 
A500 was released, because in fact I had 
been planning for a while to sell my C64 
setup and buy an Atari ST. Fortunately, 
my father bought me an A500 so that 
I could keep the C64, and for the next 
couple of years I learned everything 
about Amiga, 
discovering that aside 
from amazing games 
it was just simply a 
phenomenal desktop 
computer.
The operating 
system was so advanced 
for the time, with true 
multi-tasking; a power-
user's dream. Like 
countless other owners 
I spent way too many 
hours messing around 
in Deluxe Paint even 
though I have very 
little artistic ability; it 
I

me back then, a real pleasure to learn 
and work with.

Temples) was the turning point for me. 
After a short period working for Choice 
Software, who produced games under 
contract to Ocean, they were working 
on their own platformer. Showing me a 
work-in-progress version on the C64, I 
asked if I could have a go at porting it to 
the Amiga.
We used to meet up on Saturdays in 
Belfast city centre, and hang out for a 
while, usually playing some of the latest 
coin-ops and grabbing a bite to eat, 
often before heading back to David's 
was just such a joyous experience!
Computer magazines of the time 
seemed so exciting, and it felt like every 
month they were showcasing some 
amazing new piece of software which 
was breaking down the walls of some big 
industry to the point where you could 
do it in your bedroom. I suspect many of 
us thought we could easily run our own 
newspaper empire or a tv or a movie 
studio, and it wasn't hard to see why. 
Software and hardware tools like Video 
Toaster and Lightwave 3D really were 
ground-breaking; tv shows and movies 
were actually being produced on these 
computers with this software.
My heart and my future career lay in 
programming though, and over the next 
couple of years I taught myself 68000 
assembly language, spent some hard-
saved pennies on a couple of expensive 
Amiga reference manuals, and began to 
explore the machine from the inside.
What a journey. The graphics 
hardware was light years ahead of the 
C64, which I revered. The things you 
could make it do. Or at least, the things 
that more advanced coders than myself 
could do. The Amiga demoscene was 
filled with incredible technical sorcery, 
utterly perplexing and pushing me to 
figure out how they achieved these effects.
After releasing a few fairly average 
demos myself on the Amiga (under the 
pseudonym Fermi, first with the Men 
In Black group, then Cyrus Corp), I 
started thinking about games. Meeting

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
as knowing an Amiga port was also 
underway, we ended up considering two 
offers between Players and Codemasters. 
In the end, we all agreed to go with 
Codemasters. However, during those 
discussions I recall having a phone 
conversation with a programmer at 
Players, relating to potentially converting 
the Amiga game to Atari ST. That 
programmer was Paul Griffiths, someone 
I still occasionally cross paths with today, 
twenty-seven years later. Everyone will 
tell you how small the games industry is 
- it really is true!
We produced a couple of CJ games 
with Codemasters, and by the time David 
programmed Spike In Transylvania he 
house. The memories are fairly hazy now, 
but over some time the game started 
to firm up on the Amiga. I don't think 
I ever took the C64 source code from 
David, but we talked about how he was 
programming things on the C64 and 
I would just do the same thing on the 
Amiga. Jon got on with reworking the 
graphics, converting the sprites and the 
16-by-16-pixel game world 'blocks' into 
the higher-resolution and more colourful 
16-bit versions.
I had also started writing a game level 
editor on the Amiga, partly just to learn 
more aspects of programming and partly 
to help us build the levels for the game. 
Looking back, it was all fairly basic stuff, 
but to me it was as exciting as could be. 
That game ended up as CJ's Elephant 
Antics.
Still quite early in its development, 
David and Jon had contacted publishers 
about signing the game. Seeing the 
excellent early C64 version, as well

big Sega hits were produced on Amiga, 
including Micro Machines and 
Fantastic Dizzy.
By the mid-1990s, the mighty 
Commodore had fallen, and 
the very respectable and reborn 
Windows 95 meant that serious 
development moved away from 
Amiga to PC. For me, that was a 
sad time, and I always looked back 
on the Amiga period as golden 
years. I still do. Amiga kickstarted 
my games development career, and 
I'll always be truly grateful for that.
had bought an Amiga, so he coded that 
version himself. Several months were 
then poured into our next title, Nobby The 
Aardvark for Thalamus. Sadly, Newsfield 
and Thalamus went into administration 
during development, and in the aftermath 
I ended up moving to Codemasters in 
late 1992, resulting in the Amiga version 
of Nobby never being completed.
Just before that move to 
Codemasters, I took on a short freelance 
project for them, producing a small 
prototype of an educational game 
featuring none other than Dizzy! Philip 
and Andrew Oliver say they don't even 
remember this, but in reality it didn't get 
very far.
At this point, I was mostly working 
on Sega Mega Drive projects for 
Codemasters. But even then, the 
Amiga played a huge part. Half of us 
there at the time were Amiga fans and 
used A4000 systems for Mega Drive 
work. Using a mix of hand-built and 
commercial tools (including DevPac for 
assembling code), a number of Codies'

sprite and scrolling demos, but it was 
the decision to hack a SEUCK game I'd 
created, Battle Ball, that led me to dip 
a toe into the industry. To my surprise 
budget game publisher Power House 
offered to release it on their £1.99 label 
- so who was I to argue? The timing of 
this deal was spot-on, as I didn't have 
enough money to buy an Amiga, but 
with the advance on royalties from Battle 
Ball I could finally afford one. 
UK stock of the Amiga A1000 was in 
somewhat short supply so my dad drove

he 1980s, what fond memories I 
have of this amazing decade. To 
experience first-hand new computer 
technologies and witness the emerging 
development of the home computer 
games industry is something I'll never 
forget. It's only in recent years I've truly 
realised how it played such a major part 
in shaping my life and my career choice. 
My first computer was a Commodore 
VIC-20, a machine my parents bought 
me to help with my homework (and 
the occasional bit of gaming). I don't 
remember using it much for maths 
but I do remember playing to death 
the early Llamasoft titles like Abductor 
and Lazer Zone; did anyone use them 
for homework? It wasn't long before I 
started to learn more about the technical 
aspects of how these machines worked 
and 'got into' computers like many of my 
generation did at that time. 
It was Christmas 1985 when I 
progressed from the basic delights of 
the VIC-20 to the awesome C128 -
what a great present from my parents. 
With it I taught myself 6502 assembler 
and it wasn't long before I was writing

had done, offered me subsequent projects. 
To quote Kevin Flynn at the start of 
Tron: Legacy, 'I got in!' 
During the next couple of years I 
worked on a few titles of varying genres, 
but one that stood out to me was a 
bizarre Gravitar-style game called The 
Executioner. I was into HR Giger quite 
heavily at the time and this can be seen 
in the look and feel of the game. This 
was the first project I'd worked on that 
took many months of development and 
required lots of artwork - previous titles 
reached the duplicators - I was out in the 
cold. My foray into the games industry 
was over before it had begun and with 
the new 16-bit machines emerging I 
made the decision to concentrate on the 
art side of games development. I'd like 
to say I had this grand plan and it was 
carefully orchestrated but of course that 
would be a work of fiction; the truth is 
far less grandiose. The reality... well there 
was no plan, I just spent all the time I 
could learning, using, and experimenting 
with the Amiga and Deluxe Paint. 
During the early 16-bit days I strived 
to create proper arcade quality graphics 
like those seen in the machines of the 
time. Being an avid fan of coin-op games 
I would often visit the arcades along 
Southend seafront analysing the graphics 
with a clinical eye, observing what they 
looked like and analysing how many 
colours they used. Before the Amiga, 
achieving anything close to arcade-level 
graphics was a pipe dream, but I could 
see with the Amiga's 4096 colours the 
'arcade look' could now be represented in 
the home. So that's what I did and built 
up a small portfolio of artwork. 
I showed my efforts to a few people 
and it wasn't long before I got my first 
graphics job working for the publisher 
Impressions. The first game I worked on, 
Renaissance-1, was a generic collection of 
four classic arcade games. It was nothing 
fancy but that didn't really bother me. 
I was grateful for the opportunity and 
I always did my best when creating the 
artwork. Impressions, pleased with what I

than a simple side-

myself that I had nothing to lose, so I 
put together a portfolio disk and sent 
it off to Jon [Hare] and Chris [Yates].

raised in magazine reviews.

particularly the Nintendo Entertainment

high price 8-bit games in their millions, 
games we felt we could easily write. The 
style of what was popular really suited 
the style of games we enjoyed making. 
Everything, except the politics of writing 
NES games, felt right and we decided to 
switch from Spectrum and Amstrad to 
the NES, rather than the Amiga. Over 
the next few years we wrote thirteen 
games on the NES while other UK

were writing were not what they were

several million sales of the Amiga before 
it became mass market enough for our 
games to start being converted and 
enhanced for the computer. The first was

brothers Andrew and Robbie Graham.

developers around us worked on the 
Amiga and Atari ST. But our brush with 
Amiga was just about to start. 
We moved into Codemasters offices 
- well portacabins - and artists were 
all using Deluxe Paint 3 on Amigas for 
creating graphics. As a result we retooled 
our pipeline so that all our NES game 
graphics were developed on Amiga, and 
for relaxation we'd often play Lemmings, 
and then later Worms on our A500s.
Meanwhile, Codemasters was riding 
high in the UK popularity stakes. Our

production team was busy finding 
developers to convert our games to all

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
A few months previously we had 
seen two of our games converted out 
of house onto the Amiga. Shoot 'Em 
Up Construction Kit, which had been 
our first ever chart topper, published by 
Palace Software, had been converted by 
none other than Richard Leinfellner, 
who went on to become someone quite 
important at EA. The second, Insects 
in Space, was converted by a team 
put together by publisher Hewson 
Consultants. Neither conversion had 
rocked the world too much and in my 
opinion neither was as good as the 
original Commodore 64 versions. So 
with International 3D Tennis we decided 
to take the conversion in-house and hire 
someone new for the job; none other 
than Dave 'Ubik' Korn, in those days a 
W
hat can I say about this amazing 
machine that has permanently 
transformed my life? 
Without the Amiga I would probably 
be doing something very different from 
still developing games today. Despite 
the fact that at Sensible Software we 
had already had a couple of number 
one games prior to the arrival of the 
Amiga in our lives we were still nowhere 
near what you could call rich. We were 
doing okay, it was 1989 and we were 
just finishing off International 3D Tennis 
on the Commodore 64, which had thus 
far been the machine from which our 
then current success as a cult British 
developer was starting to shape up.

Although Sensible Software made a name as developers 
with Commodore 64 classics such as Wizball, it was in the 
era of the Amiga that they achieved greatness with a series 
of massive hits such as Sensible Soccer and

had just finished running a two-man 
company with a friend. He was looking 
for some consulting work and we were 
looking for a competent programmer to 
join our team and lead the charge on our 
next game.
At the time Chris joined Sensible 
Software the company was just three 
people: myself, art and design; my 
partner Chris Yates, programming and 
design; Martin Galway, top C64 games 
musician and part time programmer for 
Sensible who was just about to leave for 
a new life in the United States. Chris 
Chapman fitted in to the set up instantly 
student at Cambridge University, which 
was up the road from our office.
Dave had previously written Thrust 
II on the C64, among other things, 
within which he had grappled with 
the unenviable task of making the sid 
chip sound like his hero Jimi Hendrix. 
So perhaps the polite applause of the 
Wimbledon crowd may have seemed 
like an odd place for this natural born 
hellraiser to have been applying his 
talents, but we were very happy with his 
work and International 3D Tennis was the 
first Amiga game bearing the Sensible 
name of which we really felt proud.
However Dave was not the first 
Amiga coder we had signed up, even 
though his game was first out the door.

the Amiga prior to Ubik's arrival went 
something like this: Play Defender of

by emulating arcade machines within 
the tight memory confines of a C64. 
Added to this potential was the amazing 
acquisition, via Palace Software, of 
musician and sound man Richard 
Joseph. Everything Martin was to the 
C64, Richard was to the Amiga - he was 
a proper sound genius.
For International 3D Tennis Richard 
added BBC-style Wimbledon Music and 
real tennis commentary in an era when 
speech in games was almost unknown. 
For Mega lo Mania he stepped up his 
game further by adding a series of three 
memorable tunes for the game's intro 
sequence, menus and in-game music based 
on Mars, The Bringer of War by Gustav 
Holst, plus the most memorable speech 
in any Sensible game with gems such 
as 'Do you want to be on my team' and 
'the design is ready' in a variety of voices 
and it was with him that I started to 
craft Sensible's first proper, 16-bit only, 
game on the Amiga...that game was 
Mega lo Mania.
What was amazing about the 
Amiga was how much it allowed us to 
do compared to the C64 that we had 
worked on previously. The graphics 
alone gave us so much to play with and 
as the only artist in the company at the 
time I really enjoyed it, although it did 
increase the workload somewhat from 
what I was used to. The memory size 
meant we could start to plan bigger 
worlds to include in our games, which 
had previously been inspired mostly 
"The extra resolution of the Amiga 
enabled a trademark graphic style with 
small sprites on map-like backgrounds."

burning favourite over the years that 
was not reflected at the time in Ocean's 
sales figures. However Wizkid was so 
long in development, due to Chris Yates' 
numerous other technical roles in all of 
our other titles, that Chris Chapman 
and I had time to work on a follow up to 
another one of our C64 hits: Microprose 
Soccer. This game would go on to be our 
best-selling game of all time; a perennial 
chart topper in best-ever Amiga games 
adding real character to the games in a 
way that was previously impossible to do.
In terms of the gameplay, Mega lo 
Mania morphed from a game about 
flying spaceships and managing land 
and space stations into one of the first 
ever real-time strategy (rts) games, 
with the world's first ever tech tree 
pitting cavemen against WWI pilots and 
Victorians with muskets against nuclear 
weapons. The variety of graphical detail 
needed to show this kind 
of gameplay was simply not 
possible on any of the 8-bit 
home computers.
Meanwhile Chris Yates 
and I had embarked upon 
a follow-up to Wizball,

more strategic play, and this was also 
carried through onto our next title.
For Cannon Fodder the code and art 
were by newcomers to our team Julian 
'Jools' Jameson and Stoo Cambridge. It 
was the six-man team of myself, Chris 
Yates, Chris Chapman, Ubik, Stoo 
and Jools with the addition of Richard 
Joseph that would go on to be the classic 
Sensible Software Amiga team. Between 
us we produced five No.1 Amiga 
games and topped the UK charts for an 
incredible fifty-two weeks between June 
1992-May 1995. 
Richard Joseph and I worked on a 
reggae song, 'War Has Never Been So 
Much Fun', written as the title song for 
Cannon Fodder. It was the first computer 
game to have a proper sung title, and we 
also made a silly pop video of the team 
running around to it which featured on 
some versions of the game. 
Our run of Amiga games from 
1991-1994 went: Mega lo Mania, 
Sensible Soccer, Wizkid, Cannon Fodder, 
Sensible World of Soccer, Cannon Fodder 
2, Sensible Golf. It isn't any wonder we 
were sad to see the end of this amazing 
machine. The Amiga cemented our 
reputations as game makers and it made 
us a lot of money. But more than that 
it had been so much fun to work with, 
in a small committed team, on a totally 
free platform, with excellent support 
from many British publishers who all 
paid us advances during development 
and increasingly good royalty rates at a 
time when three new games a day were 
lists... it was of course Sensible Soccer. 
Chris and I had simply taken the 
little Mega lo Mania men and dressed 
them up in football kits, let them run 
around a football pitch drawn in Mega 
lo Mania perspective, added some nice 
controls, and we had an instant hit on 
our hands. We all knew 
it in our office from the 
moment Sensible Soccer 
was first played. It was 
special. Initially released 
in June 1992, it went 
on to be converted to 
numerous platforms 
and had many versions 
on the Amiga, including Sensible World 
of Soccer, the only Amiga game to be 
inaugurated into the 2006 Stanford 
University list of the ten most influential 
games of all time.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
the native machine language for each 
platform, and I handled all the coding, 
graphics and sound myself with little 
involvement from Ocean. I just handed 
over the game when it was complete. 
There wasn't much to-ing and fro-ing for 
bug testing or difficulty tuning; often the 
first completed version I sent would be 
the finished master. 
I was self-employed, agreeing a 
flat fee for each game at the start, paid 
on completion. Typically I went to 
Manchester after a game was finished 
to get agreement on what the next 
game should be, sometimes picking it 
from arcade machines Ocean had in the 
basement.
Arkanoid was my first 16-bit title, 
for the Atari ST. This was soon after 
the ST's launch when its sales were well 
ahead of the Amiga - you could attach 
the ST to a monitor or tv, whereas 
the Amiga required a very expensive 
multisync monitor in the UK. An Amiga 
version of that game was therefore not 
really on the cards for Ocean (Discovery 
Software wrote an Amiga version in the 
US, which I thought was great). The ST 
M
y career in games started in 1982, 
releasing games for the BBC 
Micro through Superior Software, with a 
version of the Q*bert arcade game. 
After a few years producing successful 
arcade conversions for Superior, I 
saw the way the 
market was moving 
towards licensing, 
and moved to Ocean. 
The company was 
releasing official conversions of arcade 
games on the Imagine label (for whom 
I wrote Yie Ar Kung Fu and its sequel, 
and Mikie), and conversions of computer 
games through US Gold (Crystal Castles, 
Impossible Mission, Beach Head.)
These games were all written from 
my home in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in

game to the BBC Micro, Peter took those skills along to 
the 16-bit world and continued to port across many of the

using the monitor from an old Amstrad

After I'd completed the ST version, I 
contacted Discovery in the US, to see if 
they would be interested in it for Amiga. 
When I told Ocean about this, they 
agreed to release it for Amiga as well. 
My last Amiga game for Ocean was 
RoboCop, which Ocean signed at the 
script stage, and then licensed an arcade 
game to Data East, so I combined their 
version (from a suitcase again) with 
some extra elements from the Spectrum 
version, such as the shooting gallery and 
photofit stages.
game was reviewed really well, as there 
were few good arcade conversions for 
the machine at the time, and the mouse 
worked well as an input method.
With the release of the A500 in 
the UK, the Amiga had a shot at the 
mainstream, so the next game was 
written for both ST and Amiga, a 
conversion of Sensible Software's 
Wizball from the Commodore 64. This 
was converted by playing the game on 
a C64, and viewing the video of a full 
playthrough but, as with most of my 
other projects, I had none of the original 
artwork or code to work from, it all had 
to be recreated.
Since it was taking a while for the 
Amiga to build market share in the 
UK, Ocean was only interested in 
the next game, Arkanoid: Revenge of 
Doh, for ST. Ocean supplied a suitcase 
arcade machine for the conversion, 
which crammed a genuine arcade board

a brief stint producing at Eutechnyx. 
During all of that time I did little or no 
programming. 
In 2010, after over fifteen years away 
from programming, I returned to coding, 
graphics and design, teaching myself to 
code in high-level languages, and writing 
apps for iOS, including MailShot, a 
group email app which now has over 
250,000 users, and ShotList, an app for

production on mobile.

I did that, then took a few years 
out as a composer and producer 
- writing music for local tv, and 
soundtracks for a few commercial 
videos.
During this period I 
remember approaching Psygnosis 
to suggest I combine these 
disciplines to write full music 
soundtracks for their games to 
play from the cd included on 
the new CD32, and sent them a 
demo of some music from Shadow 
of the Beast with a full arrangement. They 
passed, saying they wanted to use the 
cd for loading, and more graphics, and 
thought that 3-channel sound was fine 
at the time.
My last Amiga game was Morph/ 
Metamorphosis in 1993 and was 
influenced by the console games I was 
playing at the time. It was one of the few 
game designs I created myself. It looked 
like an arcade game but was actually a 
puzzler where you had a limited number 
of switches between four physical states 
of matter, transforming from a solid 
cannonball (destruction) to a rubber 
ball (bouncing high) a liquid (slip down 
through drains) and a gas (rise up, and 
pass through grilles) to navigate from 
one end of a level to the other. Flair

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
for the Amiga was way back in 1987 
when I joined Interceptor Micro's, based 
in Aldermaston. At the time, they were 
finishing up on the Amiga and Atari 
ST versions of their popular game Into 
The Eagle's Nest and needed music for 
the title screen.They had no music 
software and it was less than a working 
week in hand before the game went to 
duplication. With this tight deadline, 
I came up with the plan to simply 
compose the music on synthesizers, 
sample it, and play it back on the 
computers. Interceptor also lacked any 
music equipment, so off we went to the 
local music store. From what I recall, 
they had a wide selection of synths but 
given the limited budget, it was a toss up 
I 
can say without doubt that seeing 
the Commodore Amiga first-hand 
was an awe-inspiring moment. A young 
boy, still at school, I ventured to London 
to attend my first computer exhibition. 
As an owner of my beloved C64, I had 
only heard of the Amiga 1000 through 
the many computer magazines that 
filled the shelves of many newsstands 
during that era. With great anticipation, 
I raced around the show floor in search 
of Commodore's new, and in my eyes, 
super computer. A large crowd gathered 
around the Commodore booth signified 
something special.  And it certainly was.   
Seeing the legendary bouncing ball 
demo was a sight for sore eyes. 
My first taste of developing anything 
Gari Biasillo
Gari composed the Target: Renegade track on the 
Commodore 64 and when the Amiga took over from its 
older brother, he provided musical scores for a number of 
Hewson Consultants' titles.
In just a week, Gari 
knocked out a musical 
score for the title 
screen of the 1987 
Interceptor release Into 
The Eagle's Nest.

Of course, I spent an equally 
unhealthy amount of time playing games 
on the A500. It's hard to pick favourites, 
but those I was particularly fond of and 
spent endless hours playing 
were Geoff Crammond's 
Formula One Grand Prix, the 
Championship Manager series, 
Kick Off, its offshoot Player 
Manager, and Ubisoft's 
Zombi.
During this period of 
developing games, I coded 
exclusively in assembly 
language. Using higher 
level languages, such as C, 
between a Yamaha DX21 and a Casio 
- the model I forget. As the Casio was 
multitimbral, had drums and an onboard 
sequencer, I begrudgingly chose this. 
To be frank, I have never been keen on 
the sonic qualities of fm synthesis. Not 
that the Casio sounded any better, and 
the sequencer was a nightmare to use 
and I couldn't get it to sync the tracks in 
time. Thankfully, I never had to use that 
keyboard again.
Dabbling with three dimensions
It wasn't until the release of the A500 
that I was able to afford my own Amiga. 
I had recently left Ocean Software to 
start up my own company, Imperial 
Software Designs, with Mike Williams, 
an old friend. We were still developing 
games for the C64 but spent a healthy 
amount of time learning the Amiga, 
using the trusty Amiga Hardware 
Reference Manual. My music software 
of choice was Dr T's Keyboard Controller 
Sequencer, which was quirky and very 
programmer-centric.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
moving from the C64, I felt positively 
spoiled. And this was before even getting 
to the advances in graphics hardware.
My first dabbling into 3D 
programming was on the Amiga. My 
introduction was accelerated by Paul 
Hughes who provided me with a small 
demo he wrote to display a rotating 
wire-frame cube using the blitter line 
draw. It was short and sweet but gave me 
a good platform to start from.
Armed with that starting point, along 
with the book Computer Graphics, and 
later Alan Watt's 3D Computer Graphics, 
Foley and Van Dam's Computer Graphics, 
and the collection of Computer Graphics 
Gems, I began exploring the exciting 
and creative new world of computer 
graphics. My first commercial 3D game 
release was the port of the C64 version 
of Moonfall to the Amiga and Atari ST, 
where I wrote a lot of the 3D framework 
for the solid polygon rendering. 
Interestingly, for rendering solid 
polygons, I found that using triangle 
left/right edgetables generated using a 
modified version of the Bresenham line 
algorithm to be faster than the hardware 
blitter line draw.
The arrival of the Japanese consoles 
along with the demise of Hewson 
Consultants, with whom we'd had a long 
term working relationship, meant that 
my time developing on the Amiga was 
short-lived. Along with the C64, the 
Commodore Amiga still holds a place in 
my heart.
simply wasn't an option given the limited 
computing power of home computers of 
the 1980s. I continued this trend with 
the next generation of 16-bit computers, 
and found the Motorola 68000 processor 
that the Amiga used to be a huge leap 
forward from the 6502 I was used to on 
the C64.
A comparative wealth of 32-bit 
registers, faster clock speed, and even 
support for integer multiplication and 
division! These bread and butter math 
operations had to be performed using 
long-winded instructions on the 6502 as 
they simply did not exist. As a developer

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
the Soundtracker music program to start 
getting noises out of the Amiga myself. 
While it was fun, my music wasn't 
good at the best of times, but I spent 
a lot of time watching and listening to 
demoscene releases, learning how things 
were done.
It wasn't long before I was meeting 
demoscene people at my secondary 
school, and I started writing in anger 
with the hope I could compose 
something which would be good enough 
to be released. That tune, if I remember 
correctly, was called 'Fractals 4', with '4' 
meaning it was the fourth completed 
track I had written - I didn't include all 
the crappy unfinished ideas.
To be honest, my full-sized 
mods were never at the high 
echelon of many other Amiga 
composers, but having heard 
a load of chiptune modules 
most notably by 4-Mat, I fell 
in love with both this style, and 
the additional constraints, and 
quickly found I had a bit of a 
knack for creating these often less 
serious sounding tunes.
C
omputers first grabbed my 
attention when I was ten years old, 
and having been given a second-hand 
Commodore 64 by my parents for my 
Birthday/Christmas I quickly took an 
interest in the sorts of sound it was able 
to create. The seed was sown. Step aside 
C64, and when I was sixteen it was time 
to say hello to a second-hand Amiga 
having had my mind blown by the 
Dr Awesome (Bjørn Lynne) demoscene 
track 'Tied Up' the same year.
I already had a very keen interest in 
music, from learning to play the violin 
to creating my gcse music compositions 
on the C64, and I very quickly found 
Mark Knight (TDK)
Under the name TDK (The Dark Knight), Mark created 
hundreds of tunes, many of which were used on cracked 
game and demo disks. From his C64 and Amiga roots, 
he has gone on to create music and sound effects for a 
myriad  of top-selling games.
Soundtracker - the 
instrument of choice 
for Amiga musicians.

to send off my form, I received a call 
from Richard Leinfellner at Mindscape 
offering me some freelance work, 
converting the Wing Commander music 
for the Amiga. I snapped it up and when 
(almost) completed, he offered me a full-
time position as in-house composer.
It could have been the shortest career 
in history when, during the first week, I 
heard one of my chiptunes playing in the 
production office. Mindscape had just 
released Moonstone, and had downloaded 
a copy from a bbs. I stuck my head 
around to see why they were playing 
my tune, and quickly saw that the crack 
intro introducing Moonstone was playing. 
I silently shuffled out, went back to my 
room, and shut the door very worried 
about the consequences of this.
To be fair, I had no control over what 
tune was used for what purpose, but I 
doubt very much that anyone else would 
have seen it like that. As it happens, 
Many a college day was actually spent 
in my bedroom, once mum had gone to 
work, writing these tunes - suffice to say 
my A-Level grades were not what they 
should have been, but it was allowing 
me to 'hone my trade' as it were while 
I applied for work at recording studios 
after college. 
I had already been turned down 
by Salford University to do a Music 
Technology Degree with them feeding 
back after my performance audition 
that a classically trained musician would 
not be able to deal with technology. I 
was sending Amiga disks to the various 
development companies in the UK. At 
the same time, my chiptune output was 
starting to get used within the cracking 
side of the scene on game intros.
Nothing was coming through, so 
I started my application to go into 
management training at a well known 
supermarket. The day in 1992  I was

to concentrate on game music and sound 
design.
We didn't release that many Amiga 
games at Mindscape - it was 1992 
when I started, and the Playstation was 
looming. Had you asked me back when 
I first had an Amiga, I would never have 
dreamt that I'd actually be writing music 
for games. I'm now within my twenty-
fifth year of working in the games 
business and although I stopped music 
composition full time in 1999, I had the 
opportunity to go back to it in 2014, and 
the smile is back...most of the time.
The Amiga, the demoscene, they will 
always hold a very special place in my 
heart, so much so, that I've recently got 
back into tracking with Protracker...
when real life allows me the time.
  
I got away with it but I had to have a 
serious think about how my tunes would 
be used in the future.
I soon found that as I was writing 
music all day I didn't have a need to do 
the same when I got home from work, so

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
A small history lesson then.
The likes of Ocean Software and 
US Gold bought licensing rights to the 
latest arcade hits. Ocean then usually 
employed the likes of Teque to do their 
conversions and US Gold used the likes 
of...well, Tiertex.
But it wasn't just the Atari ST and 
the Amiga that were still of interest 
to publishers, even though the 8-bit 
machines were winding down they 
were still generating enough profit that 
conversions for those machines were 
a must. So: Spectrum, C64, Amstrad 
CPC464, Atari ST and Commodore 
Amiga - and then there might be 
additional releases on the likes of the 
T
he irony is not lost on me, not 
even one little bit. My foray into 
delivering Atari ST ports to the Amiga 
is much less contentious now than it was 
back in the 1990s when Amiga owners 
were wholesale shortchanged by the 
flood of straight ports from the ST that 
frequently made no attempt to utilise the 
Amiga's more powerful capabilities at all.
On the whole the Atari ST did a 
lot of damage to the Amiga. Well, let's 
qualify that a little: the ST wasn't so 
much to blame as was the British way of 
developing and publishing the software 
- that's what shortchanged Amiga 
owners and the ST simply made it that 
much easier.
Phil Boag-Butcher (Galahad)
Phil's early days on the Amiga were linked more to 
'hacking'  than converting forgotten ST titles for the 
Commodore computer. Those skills have come into good 
use in converting such titles as Putty and Starquake that 
never originally appeared on the Amiga. 
The Denton Designs 
classic for Ocean was 
released in 1987 for 
the Atari ST, Spectrum 
and DOS, but not for 
the Amiga... yet.

Games started to be written first for the 
Amiga, and then if the Atari ST was 
lucky enough, it might get a cut down 
version. Nevertheless, the Atari ST did 
get releases that the Amiga didn't. Some 
msx, maybe even a dos version as well 
as consoles like the NES and Master 
System (typically the last two were 
handled by others). And this is where 
the British system of developing and 
publishing betrayed Amiga owners. 
More often than not, the likes of Teque 
developed all six or seven versions of a 
title, and on tight deadlines.
The Amiga version was likely to be the 
last to be developed for the simple reason 
that the ST code could be converted in 
a matter of days to the Amiga. Maybe 
they would put in a few extras to jazz it 
up a little, or in the case of Tiertex, simply 
didn't bother.  So hey presto the Amiga 
version was done and the publisher 
rejoiced in many versions for sale. Amiga 
owners looked at their screen and sighed 
as they tried to fathom why such a 
powerful machine consistently delivered 
underwhelming looking games.
Thankfully times changed as the 
Amiga started to become factored into 
software publishers' spreadsheets when 
sales grew and lower-cost machines 
appeared to attract more game players.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
  Back in 2003 I researched games 
that never made it to the Amiga and one 
surprised me: Super Sprint, an arcade 
conversion that was pretty faithfully 
reproduced on the ST. My experience 
of the ST at this point was virtually nil. 
I'd owned one briefly before I got my 
Amiga back in 1988, but I didn't do 
anything meaningful with it other than 
play through the Power Pack of twenty 
games that came with the Atari.
In retrospect, from a coding 
perspective Super Sprint wasn't a 
great title to pick as a first conversion 
because it relied heavily on tos calls to 
do virtually everything, which would 
have made it a long slog. And then as 
a single-player game it had not aged 
well; the AI for the computer cars was 
virtually non-existent. It always worked 
better as a multi-player game against real 
live people, just as it did in the arcades.
Super Cars 1 & 2, Nitro and a few 
other notables showed how Super 
Sprint was lacking, and the days of 
might argue that Amiga owners don't 
want ST games that were not published 
for the Amiga, but I disagree. It's not as 
if there's a plethora of new releases - the 
last time the Amiga was commercially 
viable for a software publisher was back 
in the late 1990s.
My history with the Amiga is a 
somewhat murky and illicit affair, 
cracking many a copy protection while 
also working in the software business for 
a while. But those skills also help me get 
ST games onto the Amiga.
System 3's Putty Squad 
was actually developed 
for the A1200 in 1994 
and previews were sent 
to the gaming press, but 
it never materialised, 
seemingly because 
the bottom fell out 
of the 16-bit market. 
Finally, Phil persuaded 
System 3 to let him 
bring the original code 
up to date and Putty 
Squad was released 
in December 2013.

as to how fast it will be on the A500.               
There are two ways of tackling a 
modern day Atari ST conversion to 
Amiga. One method is incredibly quick 
to get the game up and running but 
sacrifices game speed; the other method 
is quite time consuming but the end 
result is a game much closer to the speed 
it would have been had the Amiga had 
an official conversion.
major multiplayer battles on Amiga was 
probably long over. So it was with great 
reluctance that I eventually cancelled the 
project.
Zoom forward a few years and a 
Frenchman by the name of Meynaf - a 
man who is far more adept at all things 
Atari ST than I will likely ever be - 
stepped in and ported it. And what a 
fantastic job he did too. There was one 
issue, however, and that was the fact 
that it needed a 68020 processor and 
aga for the palette reloading tricks the 
game employs. I had it in my mind that 
I wanted it to run on the A500 at an 
acceptable speed, as traditionally, it's 
the A500 that would have received the 
conversion had the software houses done 
it back in the day. Still, that's a small 
complaint really, because it comes down 
to entirely how the conversion is tackled 
In 1985, Starquake 
appeared on Spectrum, 
C64, Amstrad CPC, 
MSX, Atari 8-bit, the 
BBC Micro in 1987 
and Atari ST and dos in 
1988, but the Amiga 
version planned for 
1991 never made it.

Fortunately I have access to the 
talents of some other guys that help me 
try and make my conversions a touch 
more Amiga than a simple straight Atari 
ST conversion, whether it be a straight 
conversion of the music into Protracker 
format, or a more Amiga interpretation 
with nice sounding samples, or the 
graphic efforts to give the game an 
introduction sequence that it didn't 
originally have.
The work I have done on the likes 
of When Time Stood Still, Ranarama 
and Starquake has been made better by 
the talents of guys like ADRDesign, 
Hoffman, Greyfox, Predseda, Leathered, 
Estrayk, Mark R Jones and many more, 
just to add at least a touch of finesse to 
games that really should have had Amiga 
versions in the first place.  
I don't have the official source code 
to the Atari ST versions of any games 
I've converted or I am in the process of 
converting. I have to use my hacking 
background to go into the program 
code and modify various elements until 
something eventually appears on screen.
The main stumbling block to doing 
these conversions is the Atari ST display 
format, which is quite different from that 
of the Amiga.

could get my parents to spring for one 
on my birthday. 'Please allow 28 days 
for delivery', the advert said, but the 
machine was so in demand, all I received 
on the delivery day was a letter from 
Sinclair asking me to wait another 
month! For a teenager, it was like 
waiting a lifetime.
When the machine finally arrived, I 
dived straight in and soon had a few very 
simple games working using the basic 
coding language - 'avoid the falling 
letters' type of thing. At the back of the 
manual there was a tantalising 
reference to something called 
machine code and I got the 
inkling there was something 
very special about being able 
to use it. That aspect was all 
a bit cryptic at the time, so I 
never dived into machine code 
until I obtained a Sinclair ZX 
Spectrum later.
I was already a professional 
games coder when I first 
encountered the Amiga around 
1990. I'd already finished 
quite a few games on the ZX

with the Commodore PETs at school 
and playing coin-ops in the arcades, so I 
was keen on getting hold of a computer

All the fancy American-made 
computers were way too expensive 
for me at the time, but the ZX81 was 
just £70 and, with a bit of cajoling, I

Spectrum such as Exolon, Cybernoid 
and Stormlord. I was working for Vivid 
Image having just finished a game called 
Time Machine. They had the seed of an 
idea for a platform beat 'em up called 
First Samurai (the name was a play on 
the Last Ninja series that the team had 
worked on previously). They wanted to 
develop it on this new-fangled machine 
called the Amiga.
I only created two games on the 
Amiga, First Samurai and Second 
Samurai. I wish I had coded more 
because the Amiga was brilliant, but 
consoles were calling, in the shape of the 
Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo. 
These machines had great capabilities 
too and were very popular. They stole 
some of the Amiga's thunder in terms of 
games.
Vivid wanted to develop First 
Samurai for the new Amiga computer 
and they already had some of the sprites 
and background graphics drawn. The 
graphics and animation looked great, 
and with the power of the new Amiga, I 
knew the game would look brilliant.
Coding for the Amiga was a real 
pleasure, all those colours, memory, great 
sound and the hardware blitter were a 
real luxury after years of being hampered 
by the limitations of 8-bit machines. 
The 16-bit 68000 cpu was also a very 
nice cpu with lots of registers and a 
consistent instruction set compared to 
the 8-Bit z80 of the ZX Spectrum.

up to the Amiga via a serial cable or 
some kind of setup like that. I wrote the 
code on the pc, compiled it, then sent it 
down to the Amiga to test.
The team at Vivid had created a 
clever sprite cutter that could extract the 
individual frames from the images - the 
sprites in First Samurai were typically 
composed of more than one rectangle so 
it wouldn't be drawing loads of empty 
space, which would be inefficient. I also 
remember having a custom map-editor 
for designing the levels.
I think First Samurai stood out 
because of several factors: it looked great; 
the sound was over-the-top and loud; 
the levels were sprawling; and there was 
some humour in there too. We had put 
a ton of work into it and it showed with 
loads of levels, enemies and bosses. The 
gameplay was quite involved too with 
lots of exploration and puzzle solving; 
this set it aside from a basic scrolling 
beat 'em up.
The Amiga was a ground-breaking 
machine, way ahead of its time. Its 
graphics and sound capabilities were 
awesome, it had a wonderful cpu that 
was easy to code, lots of memory and it 
looked cool too.
Computers like the Spectrum were 
great, but you always felt that lots of 
compromises had been made to keep 
their costs affordable. The Amiga felt 
like it had been designed with few 
compromises, and you knew that it 
would be possible to create real arcade 
quality games on it.  
The brilliant music was externally 
sourced, but I had a huge amount of 
fun creating the sound effects using the 
Amiga's sample playing abilities. It was 
amazing being able to do that after the 
Spectrum. I went overboard and even 
put some sounds in as a bit of a joke 
such as loud orchestral stabs and even 
the Hallelujah Chorus. Mev at Vivid was 
suitably amused and they stayed in. The 
sound ended up being one of the most 
memorable aspects of the game.

sort of 68000 assembler on a pc hooked

hardware up to various bits of external 
electronics to make it do really useful 
things like flash an led or read data in 
from an 8-bit adc and try and control 
stuff with dacs. At the time I was also 
into very early arcade games and was 
addicted to Breakout and Space Invaders, 
so naturally I tried to mimic these in 
machine code on my primitive Z80 
system with its blocky black and white 
graphics.
In 1979-80 the Atari 800 burst onto 
the scene with games like Star-Raiders, 
and I was hooked on it right from the 
start because not only could it display 
colour bitmaps but it seemed to have 
additional magical graphical abilities that 
the lowly 1mhz 6502 processor could not 
have produced on its own. I immersed 
myself in the hardware bible that was 
De Re Atari and disappeared into a 
dark room for months to learn all its 
secrets and experiment with its unusual 
hardware, namely the chip set built 
around a programmable video processor 
called antic and its family of tv and 
sound hardware control chips, freeing up 
the main 6502 microprocessor to get on 
I 
had an early start with computers as far 
back as 1976-78, first by building them 
on breadboards out of raw microprocessor 
chip families and then by making some 
early home brew kits (SC/MP 8-bit, 
Fairchild F8, 6800, Z80, Nascom1 and 2, 
Compukit-101 and others).
This was about four to five years 
before any software tools or third-
party games were available. So, in those 
prehistoric days we had to blow 1k 
roms and write everything from scratch 
from bootstrap code onwards. It was 
all done with hex keypad entry byte by 
byte, and primitive 
monochrome 
character-set based 
text screens on a black 
and white television, 
and if you were lucky 
you could save your 
500 byte program out 
to an audio cassette 
using a 300 baud 
audio coupler or 
dedicated cassette tape 
interface system.

Having made an impact on the Commodore 64 with titles 
such as Dropzone and International Karate, Archer found 
further success on the Amiga with International Karate +,

8-bit Atari. But despite its graphic 
advantages at the time, it just wasn't 
going to happen due to its lack of maths 
ability, and what I had in mind needed 
an intense amount of maths as well as 
ball plotting with things like dynamic 
shadows. 
In 1987 I bought an Atari ST 
with the intention of doing some sort 
of Dropzone upgrade, and also IK+ 
conversion and enhancement. Initially I 
played around with all sorts of software 
and hardware for it, like a video grabber, 
sound effects editors, midi stuff and 
played loads of the new fangled 16-bit 
games. I also revisited my 3D snooker 
with game code. This hardware gave the 
Atari 400/800 computers a distinct edge 
when it came to immersive games as 
they could do things other contemporary 
home computers couldn't get close to, 
such as smooth scrolling, player-missile-
sprites, screen line interrupts, hardware 
collision detection and more.
I exploited all of these hardware 
abilities to make the scroll-fest shoot-
em-up that became my first released 
game, Dropzone, in 1984. It was delayed 
from 1981 because I went off to 
university to do a degree in cybernetic 
electronic control systems. In 1985-86 
I programmed the 8-bit International 
Karate / IK1 /World Karate Championship 
(USA) game on the Atari then the 
Commodore 64, followed in late 1987 
by 8-bit versions of IK+ with its key 
innovation of the third on-screen fighter 
and those bonus rounds. 
Throughout the mid-1980s I often 
remembered a weird vivid dream I had 
had in about 1982, about snooker! It's 
best described as if I was looking down 
onto a snooker table that had a camera 
suspended by string from the overhead 
lighting canopy following balls around 
the table as they rolled. I think this was 
triggered off back then as snooker was 
big on tv with stars like Steve Davis, 
Ray Reardon and so on being regulars 
on Pot Black and numerous snooker 
tournaments covered for hours on tv.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
Meanwhile, in 1987, I was contracted 
by Activision to produce an enhanced 
16-bit version of IK+ for the Amiga as 
the prime sales machine at the time, 
with the ST version as a runner up, and 
the snookery stuff had to be put on hold 
for a while. I promptly set about genning 
up on the Amiga hardware, carrying 
over much of the ST code experiments, 
and writing ever more complex demo 
code to produce fancy effects with the 
far more interesting Amiga graphics and 
sound hardware. I studied the hardware 
reference manuals at length and was 
amazed to find that the Amiga hardware 
seemed to be a 16-bit evolutionary 
development of the 8-bit Atari hardware, 
right down to some control registers 
having the same name, along with 
cutesy named chips looking after various 
chunks of hardware. It's only with 
hindsight that I now realise the common 
link was the hardware architect/chip 
designer, namely the late Jay Miner. As 
is now well documented, his hardware 
design 'template' arguably goes back to 
the mid-1970s with the Atari vcs tia 
dream, and started to get more and more 
drawn into code writing experiments just 
trying to squeeze the absolute maximum 
amount of machine code throughput 
on the 68000 by devising a pseudo ball 
plotting routine complete with fudged 
shadows. This was purely bitmap driven, 
using huge look-up tables and minimal 
maths. But I also started doing intensive 
experiments on how fast I could do a 
set of fixed point and floating point 
maths routines in 32 and 64 bits, all 
of which would eventually be used in 
what became Jimmy White's Snooker in 
1991, although for years before launch I 
only ever called it '147'. From memory 
I realised overall that the 68k-based ST 
with its 32-bit data path, 8mhz clock 
and hardware multiply/divide commands 
was twenty to forty times quicker than a 
6502 Atari 800, depending on what you 
were trying to do. 
International Karate + 
may have been a 
ten-fold improvement 
over the original C64 
incarnation, but it left

the long hours spent 
developing the game.

mouse button click on a specific pixel 
within the control icon grid. It was buggy 
but predictable, but good enough for me 
to edit all of the IK+ animation frames 
for the Amiga and ST.  
I also didn't have the time to do a full 
re-write of IK+ from 8-bit 6502 to 16/32 
bit 68k, so I made use of the 68000's 'dot 
byte' mode and more or less did a line-
for-line conversion from the 6502 code. 
Amazingly, it struggled to life in about 
four days of intense coding.
Once up and running, I spent six 
months rewriting chunks and adding 
chip, that then evolved into the Atari 
8-bit family of antic, ctia, gtia, pokey, 
then the Amiga's Copper, Blitter, Agnus, 
Denise, Paula chips. 
However, I was under commercial 
pressure to write games that sold to the 
biggest market segment at the time, so 
this meant I had to ensure any game 
code I developed had to run on a bog 
standard Atari ST with 512k of ram, 
and the same for a base spec Amiga 
A500 without much time to devise 
Amiga specific routines.  
Being under pressure to deliver a 
game, I also didn't have 
much time to learn the range 
of software development 
tools for graphics and code, 
so to save time I continued 
to use an ST art program 
called NEOchrome (sorry 
to all the Deluxe Paint fans 
out there). NEOchrome 
was a surprisingly good art 
program, and also had a 
hidden animation facility 
activated by a bizarre right

development tool 
NEOchrome - just what's 
needed to produce great 
graphics on the Amiga.

The Story of the Amiga in Pixels
German text, seriously! But I've only 
ever seen about twenty revealed on the 
Internet. 
Code was initially written with 
Devpac, but I migrated to the amazingly 
fast PDS editor/assembler/debugger 
(Programmer Development System) 
written by two experienced game dev 
friends of mine, Andy Glaister and 
Foo Katan. The system was hosted 
on an early Dell pc running dos, and 
linked to the Amiga or ST via a parallel 
interface. It was amazingly fast, in 
that I could make a code change, then 
press a button and assemble/compile  
60,000 lines of code and graphics and 
download it and then run it...in under 
five seconds. It massively enabled rapid 
code development. It also had excellent 
debugging tools, break points, memory 
interrogation/editing and so on, and I 
continued to use it right up until 1993. 
The Amiga had far superior sound 
ability to the ST's somewhat primitive 
4-bit AY-3-8910 that had its roots in 
the mid 1970s. The Amiga's Paula chip 
allowed for 8-bit samples and dma data 
control freeing up the processor to do 
its thing. However, both machines only 
had 512k of ram, and I always wanted 
to write games that loaded in one go, 
without resorting to disk loads at any 
point, so using memory hungry sampled 
sound was going to be a problem. 
However, I managed to get the extensive 
sound effects and samples for snooker 
used on the Amiga into about 80k. To 
make the applause and crowd effects

home for it. It eventually went out as 
Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker in 
September 1991, published by Virgin.
However, it was still called 147 right 
up until about June 1991. The change 
of name came about when it was being 
previewed at a London games show 
when a certain Jeremy Beadle walked 
past the Virgin stand with a phone stuck 
to his ear. He stopped, looked at the 
game doing its demo on a giant screen 
and promptly came over to say it played 
like Jimmy White. In the following 
discussion he said he could introduce us 
to Barry Hearn, Jimmy's then manager 
... and the rest is history. The deal was 
done within a week, and we remain good 
friends to this day! 
After Jimmy White's Whirlwind 
Snooker in 1991, I was then under 
pressure to adapt it into a pool game. So 
the functionality grew with three sets 
of pool rules added, a rule editor put in, 
tournament modes, yadda yadda, and 
loads more computer player profiles. 
With snooker there was only one set of 
rules and four computer players, Tom, 
Dick, Harry and Jimmy - whereas with 
pool it grew to twenty or so and all the 
names chosen related to people I knew at 
the time, a theme which continued into 
later games I did like Jimmy White's 2: 
Cueball (1998), CueBall World (2001) and 
even Pool Paradise (2004) to some extent. 
One memorable problem with the pool 
game was the lack of memory space and 
lack of processing power to make the 
pool ball numbers roll around the ball 
games programmers resorted to similar 
techniques. 
IK+ 16-bit went out through 
Activision in 1988 and straight to 
the number one spot, which was cool. 
But with various business-greed-legal 
arguments going on in the background it 
didn't stay there very long, which was not 
so cool (that's worthy of another article). 
'147' evolved on and off during the 
course of 1989-91 in between various 
other life episodes as well as wasting 
months playing Lemmings and Populous.  
It was initially signed up to Activision 
again, and there was some early talk 
about getting Stephen Hendry to 
endorse it, but the publisher went belly-
up in 1990 and I had to find another

By 1993, I was under more

into the Sega Mega Drive with less ram, 
its bottleneck video system, no keyboard, 
etc, and make it run in 3D just as fast as 
an Amiga, even though there were very 
few 3D games on that console! That was 
a major challenge but I managed it using 
what I now know to be called an mpeg-

got approached by other games people 
to license the 3D engine. It was also the 
last program I ever completed entirely by 
myself, because by 1996 I was tempted

minded people and this was how we got 
to know each other.
When the Amiga was released in 
Germany we were all very eager to 
get one. Willi Bäcker from yet-to-be-
founded Factor 3 (we started with three 
guys, hence the name) got the first 
Amiga A1000 you could buy in our 
hometown of Cologne and was allowed 
to borrow a couple of boxes of Amiga 
documentation from the retail store. 
This documentation was not available to 
regular customers - so theoretically we 
had a head start.
But we did not start coding our first 
game until one day in March 1987 when 
we - that is myself, Achim Moller and 
Willi Bäcker - drove three hundred 
kilometres to the CeBIT Computer 
Trade Show in Hannover where we 
hoped to see some new games for our 
software-starved Amiga. Sure, there 
had been a few nice games like Marble 
Madness, Defender of the Crown or 
Skyfox, but none of the arcade action 
games like for example R-Type, which 
we loved to play so much at that time.
Sadly there was nothing on display 
H
ad it not been for the lack of 
decent games for our beloved 
Amiga we probably would never have 
started developing games and Factor 5 
would never have existed.
The guys from our team had been 
friends since the days of the C64. 
In those days the male-dominated 
scene regularly met to copy, trade and 
sometimes hack games. Some of us 
used the machine for coding, others for 
gaming. In doing so I met a lot of like-
Lutz Osterkorn 
A founder member of German software developers Factor 3 - later 
to expand to Factor 5 - Lutz and the team produced some of the 
best- looking games on the Commodore Amiga, with 
Turrican being a firm favourite with fans to this very day.

short on an Amiga development team. So 
Rainbow Arts asked us if we could do it.
It was so unreal. First we develop 
a game as an homage to our favourite 
arcade game and two years later we do 
the real thing, something of which we 
would never have dreamt. We were so 
enthusiastic about it.
By that time the team already had 
found its missing two original members 
- Holger Schmidt and Stefan Tsuparidis 
- so we changed the team's name to 
Factor 5.
Sadly, we were given only three 
which came close and we almost left 
disillusioned and empty-handed until 
we stumbled across the booth of NEC 
Corporation. They were displaying 
the PC Engine [TurboGrafx-16 
Entertainment SuperSystem] and it 
was running our favourite arcade game 
R-Type in an acrylic display case. That's 
the first time we ever saw the PC Engine 
and R-Type was so amazing. We tried 
to persuade the Japanese staff that they 
should sell it to us but communication 
wasn't easy and the booth staff finally 
made a gesture with their hands that 
they would have to commit seppuku if 
they returned without the machine. So 
we gave up - we didn't want anybody to 
commit suicide because of a video game.
But this inspired us and on our way 
back home we had the bold idea that we 
should develop our own shoot 'em up. 
This is how Neutralizer was born, though 
it got changed after a bit to Katakis and 
this original story even made it in the 
Katakis manual partially. In our search to 
sell our game to the highest bidder we 
later contacted Rainbow Arts and sealed 
a publishing deal with them.
However, because we borrowed 
too much content from our favourite 
R-Type Rainbow Arts was threatened 
with legal action by Activison, which 
in the meantime had acquired the 
publishing rights to R-Type from the 
Irem Corporation for various platforms. 
Activision proposed a deal to drop the 
lawsuit if Rainbow Arts would handle 
the Amiga conversion because they were

ST version, which we would redraw 
anyway. This meant we had to code the 
game from scratch.The only reference we 
had were photos we'd taken of R-Type 
by visiting the local arcade while one of 
the guys played the game. To make the 
process less time consuming and more 
accurate in the development we finally 
bought an original R-Type arcade pcb 
for reference. During this time Julian 
Eggebrecht from Rainbow Arts joined 
the team as a producer and became a 
Factor 5 member and later a ceo.
After we finished R-Type Rainbow 
Arts asked us if we could handle the 
Amiga port of Turrican. This is how 
Turrican for Amiga, in close cooperation 
with its original creators Manfred Trenz 
and Andreas Escher, came to be.
We knew that the game turned out 
pretty well because everyone on the 
team loved playing it, however I don't 
think any of us could have imagined that 
almost thirty years later Turrican would 
still be such a fan favourite.
months' development time which didn't 
allow us to make the game as arcade-
perfect as we would have liked.
To make matters worse we had 
almost no support by Activison or Irem, 
except for the graphics set for the Atari 
Factor 5 offices, Cologne 
in 2016: Willi Bäcker,
Stefan Tsuparidis and 
Lutz Osterkorn.

Christopher John Payne 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s when Chris was 
managing director at Europress Software he came up with 
the brand name Mandarin Software. He explains how 
AMOS The Creator on the Mandarin label unleashed the 
imagination of Amiga owners with a bent to make their 
own games and demos.
O
ne day I was called into 
a meeting with Peter 
Holmes, who was employed 
to find new products for the 
Europress range of companies. 
He showed off STOS BASIC for 
the Atari ST, created by François 
Lionet, which had sold in low 
numbers in France, in some bland, blue-
coloured packaging.
It was a basic programming 
language with a range of commands to 
move sprites around the screen, add 
music, and more. This made it ideal 
for creating games.
Peter and I looked at each other, 
and we knew what to do: market 
STOS BASIC as a games creation 
tool. I asked Project Manager 
Richard Vanner to design a 
couple of games to bundle with 
the product. We launched STOS onto the 
UK market, and it was a massive success. 
Richard worked closely with François 
to create the Amiga version which we 
decided to call AMOS - The Creator. We 
launched it early in 1990 and it sold 
incredibly well, and led to thousands of 
Amiga owners learning to program. 
According to one magazine 
article at the time, 'AMOS 
has more support than any 
language I've ever seen. 
There is an AMOS 
PD disk collection 
(over three hundred 
disks!) in Europe, and 
a separate one in Australia.' 
We went on to publish AMOS 
Compiler, AMOS Professional, 
Easy AMOS - and AMOS 
3D, created by a company 
called Voodoo Software in 
Oxford.
Richard Vanner later set up 
The Games Creators with Lee 
Bamber and published Dark 
Basic for PC. François Lionet 
went on to set up ClickTeam, 
and create The Game Factory 2, 
Multimedia Fusion 2 and more 
for PC. I created a mail order business 
called LifeTools, selling personal 
development products, and now teach 
coaches, trainers and consultants to 
make money using online courses.
A sophisticated 
development language 
with more than 500 
commands, AMOS - The 
Creator returned game 
creation to the back 
bedroom programmer.

sprang onto the screen. Then there was 
a futuristic street scene, complete with a 
figure walking a dog and a fire hydrant 
that constantly changed shapes. Finally 
a red-and-white-striped ball began to 
bounce, the sound changing and echoing 
as it bounced to different heights.'
So it was written in The New York Times 
on 29 August 1984, marking the start of a 
revolution in colour, animation, processing 
power and sheer excitement. The Amiga 
debuted, and for a few years was the most 
desirable of all home computers. Even 
when US Commodore's poor management 
ended its reign, the Amiga refused to die 
and lives today through the enthusiasm of 
gamers and former demoscene adherents. 
This book charts the Amiga's history, looks 
at the best of its games and reveals the 
memories of those involved in the rise, fall 
and resurgence of the "first aesthetically 
satisfying personal computer."†
