EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE EDITOR
Sharil Abdul Rahman | PC.com Editor
A
pril is upon us, and weirdly enough, we are getting 
more showers than usual. When it rains, it pours. 
The same thing can be said about the tech world. 
Many companies announce and introduces new 
products around this time of year, and around the 
same time as well. Welcome to MWC 2017. 
Mobile World Congress happens yearly in Barcelona, and is 
where companies show off their latest mobile product – be it 
for the consumer or the enterprise. This year nostalgia seems to 
tinge the trade show, as older names are putting out products. 
Names like Nokia and Blackberry were on the tip of everyone’s 
tongue there. We penned some thoughts on the matter, so check 
it out in out cover story this month. 
We have too many good products this month in our tested 
labs, so check out what we have in store for you. I personally 
tested the new Sony RX100 Mk V, and I was blown away by the 
results I got from the compact camera. What else did I think 
about the camera? Flip to page 58 to find out. We also tested the 
new AMD Ryzen, and see if it can be the new processor to own 
for DIYer around. At the same time, my colleagues also reviewed 
items from Wacom, Acer, OUkitel, Doogee, and Samsung. So, 
head on to page 54 to read out verdicts for this month. 
Do you need some honor? For Honor will pit you against 
enemies looking for thiers, while you try to keep the honour of 
winning the battle against them. This hack and slash game 
is something else altogether, so check out the review in our 
Gametime section this month. 
As we start the second quarter of 2017, we hope you will enjoy 
what we have in store in the magazine for the month ahead. 
Happy reading. 
Errata: We have mislabeled the awards for certain products 
in March issue in error, so here are the proper labels for the 
affected products.
We sincerely apologize for this error.

I just read your article Mechanical Keyboard Perfected With The New Razer 
BlackWidow Chroma V2 and it has left me wondering which of the three major 
switch types (clicky, tactile, and linear) is trending right now, and why? I hear 
this question often, and since you already talked about mechanical keyboards I 
think your knowledge can help me realize the facts. Thanks!

Hello PC.com. Is DDR3 memory really dead?
Robert Chan
LETTER 
OF THE 
MONTH
Thank you for your question Alec. 
I wouldn’t necessarily say which switch type is trending but more of which switch type would suit a user best. 
As all keyboard users have different preferences when it comes to keyboards, it would be hard to say one is more 
popular than the other.
For those who are looking for a great mechanical keyboard for both work and play, clicky switches are best for 
its audible click. If you’re a hardcore gamer who plays MMO or FPS, a tactile switch would suit you best as there is 
no audible click with a smaller tactile bump compared to clicky switches. Linear switches on the other hand have 
no audible click or tactile bump. Linear switches are most sought-after by gamers who are into fast-paced games 
like FPS as it has faster reaction time as compared to the previous two switches mentioned above.
Hope this helps!
I wouldn’t say it’s completely dead but it is dying as 
most, or if not all next-gen systems are already on DDR4 
memory as it has higher clock speeds compared to DDR3. 
DDR4 is also the current choice for most systems seeing 
as it is the latest in technology so far.

Leica-engineered lenses a mainstay, with extra features thrown in
The Huawei P10 & P10 Plus Is Here
he 
new 
flagship 
from 
Huawei 
has 
arrived 
on 
Malaysian 
shores. 
Announced barely three weeks ago 
in Barcelona – the latest smartphone 
from the company is now launched 
in Malaysia, alongside several new 
models to start the 2017 range for 
Huawei. The phones announced 
includes the new P10, P10 Plus 
and the P10 Lite. Malaysia was 
announced as one of the countries 
in the first wave to get the phone, 
and the launch marks Malaysia 
as the first country to launch the 
smartphone in the region.
The Huawei P10 and the P10 
Plus are both co-engineered with 
Leica, which translates to the 
Leica-certified optics in use in the 
smartphone. For the first time, all 
three (two rear and single front) 
lenses are now Leica-certified, 
which means that images taken 
with every sensor will be of the 
highest quality.
“We are ecstatic that once 
again Malaysia will be one of the 
T
first countries to experience the 
latest technological advancements 
that Huawei has to offer. The P10, 
P10 Plus and P10 Lite represents 
Huawei’s commitment in providing 
its consumers high levels of 
innovation, giving Malaysians an 
edge to stay ahead,” said Matthew 
Ng, Deputy Country Director of 
Huawei Consumer Business Group 
(Malaysia). “We strongly believe the 
P10 series will further strengthen 
and grow Huawei’s presence in 
Malaysia, giving our users the best 
Huawei has to offer at a reasonable 
price point,” he added.
Huawei also introduced the P10 
Lite to those who desire for luxury at 
an affordable price point. While it lacks 
the dual-camera setup that its larger 
siblings have, it still has the high-quality 
finish and build expected from Huawei 
at this point of time. Another model, 
the Nova Lite, meanwhile aims to be 
the champion of the mid-ranger with its 
design and performance package.
When asked, Matthew also said 
that the brand is moving towards 
a three-prong marketing strategy, 
with the Mate and S series leading 
the way. Thanks to the support of 
the market, Malaysia was chosen 
as one of the first countries to 
receive the phones to be on sale. 
With over 250,000 units shipped 
for the P9 family and over 50,000 
units sold for the Mate 9 – Huawei 
is ranked number two in the 
Malaysian market for 2016 in terms 
of market share.
Matthew 
also 
shared 
that 
Huawei is aiming to open up 100 
more Huawei Experience Stores in 
Malaysia by the end of the year, 
bringing the total up to 300 by 
December 2017. This, along with 
the projected 5000 Huawei Touch 
Points will bring the brand more 
into the forefront of the market in 
Malaysia.
The Huawei P10 (with a 4GB 
RAM/64GB Storage option) will 
be priced at RM 2,499 when it is 
available officially at the end of 
March, with the Huawei P10 Plus 
(with 6GB RAM/128GB storage) 
available for RM 3,099 by middle 
of April. The P10 Lite (with 4GB 
RAM/32GB Storage) meanwhile 
will be priced at RM 1,299. These 
prices represents an increase over 
the previous generation, but is 
priced significantly lower than the 
official 
European 
recommended 
retail price.
Two colour options will be 
available – Prestige Gold and 
Graphite Black, with other colour 
options to be available as and when 
the market demands of it.

IBM Shows Off 
Watson In Malaysia
IBM working with businesses to leverage cognitive technologies to enhance workflow
BM showed off their AI capabilities 
in Malaysia during the Watson 
Malaysia Summit.
Watson, IBM’s augmented 
intelligence (AI) technology, is already in 
use in more than 45 countries and across 
20 different industries, including health 
care, financial services, retail and 
education markets. For IBM, AI isn’t 
Artificial Intelligent, but Augmented 
Intelligence – both of which IBM regards 
as part of cognitive computing.
“AI is here and it’s a reality. It’s 
no longer a dream, and it’s now 
a prerequisite for a competitive 
advantage,” speaking at the Watson 
Malaysia Summit, IBM Malaysia 
Managing Director Chong Chye Neo 
addresses the audience. “The 4th 
industrial revolution is here, and the 
impact to human lives is so significant 
it is given its own revolution, although it 
is based of the 3rd revolution, which is 
Information Technology.”
The summit was attended by over 
300 customers and business partners 
from the banking, financial services, 
I
manufacturing, 
government, 
and 
healthcare 
industries; 
showcasing 
live 
demonstrations 
of 
cognitive 
technologies currently deployed today in 
Malaysia as well globally by companies 
such as Silverlake Axis, Sunlife-I, MDT 
Innovations and Skymics.
With many fears surrounding the 
rise of AI, Chong notes that IBM’s 
vision “isn’t about machines replacing 
humans, but machine and man 
working together.” During her welcome 
address she shares and highlights the 
three principles that IBM and their 
partners follow for building with AI – 
purpose, transparency and skills.
“There needs to be a purpose – it 
does not mean anything if AI is not 
deployed in the context of an industry 
domain. Your information needs to 
be transparent – cognitive is about 
learning, so the source of information 
is important. It has to be reliable and 
verified. Finally, every profession will 
be disrupted. The question is who will 
take responsibility to teach the skills for 
using AI, not let the AI use you.”
Since its first fame in 2011 after 
winning a game show, IBM has advanced 
Watson’s capabilities and made it 
available via the cloud. Watson is being 
trained in eight additional languages 
(apart from English) including German, 
Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, 
Japanese, Arabic, French and Italian. 
Watson is designed to understand 
context and complexity of the natural 
language, and sorting through structured 
and unstructured data.
As of today, Watson can run a set 
of over 50 APIs, with services across 
language, speech, vision, and data 
insights. IBM has also opened the 
Watson platform to developers and 
entrepreneurs, enabling them to build 
and bring to market their own powered 
by Watson applications for a variety 
of industries. Currently, Watson has 
been deployed for use in diagnosing 
cancer, detecting autism, advance 
early childhood education, transforming 
banking practices, improving farming 
practices and inventing new recipes.
Some of the capabilities showcased 
by Watson includes IBM Bluemix, 
a cloud platform that helps customers 
solve business problems and drive 
business value with applications, 
infrastructure and services. Bluemix 
is used to help build systems that use 
data to understand, reason, and learn.
IBM Watson Analytics is a smart 
discovery service available on the cloud 
that guides data exploration, automates 
predictive 
analytics 
and 
enables 
effortless dashboard and infographic 
creation; 
providing 
new 
insights 
quickly and easily with automated data 
analysis, automatic visualization and 
predictive analytics.
Watson is also used for helping 
recruitment and training within the 
company. Other Watson APIs are 
integrated into chat applications such 
as Telegram and Slack as a chatbot; 
enhancing Alexa’s capability with 
implementation on Echo Dot; as well as 
other wearables.
Watson lives in the cloud – so 
any services accessing Watson will 
require a data connection. However, 
during a press address, Jimmy 
Kwang, General Manager for IBM 
Software Malaysia said Watson is 
designed to be light – without using 
up too much bandwidth. Chong also 
joined the media address, telling the 
press that IBM is working on creating 
a “playground” to bring together 
developers for co-creation. The centre 
will be announced soon.
While 
most 
of 
Watson’s 
capabilities are globally available, 
Kwang and Chong notes that many 
systems are still subjected to local 
laws and regulations, which will take 
time before Watson can be integrated 
and deployed into certain industries, 
for example medical and law.

Venus Engine to achieve crisp, high-

and with high contrast. The sensor 
supports up to ISO 25600, resulting 
in great performance even in low-

To make life in the selfie lane 
easier, Panasonic has bestowed 
upon the camera a rear flip-up touch 
screen monitor measuring thee-
inches that helps in the composition 
during selfie shoots. Special modes 
such as Buddy Snap means that 
the camera can automatically snap 
images when two or more subjects 
come into the frame, and the second 
shutter button eliminates awkward 
hand-holds while taking the shot.
After the shot, users can transfer 
off their images from the camera to a 
smart device via WiFi, which offers a 
more flexible shooting experience 
and instant image sharing with a 
single touch. The camera stores 
its images in a SD card, which can 
also be connected to any computer 
with ease.
It will be available in four different 
colours – silver, black, orange or pink 
when it is made available later this 
year. The sleek and stylish profile of 
the LUMIX GF9 puts it right at home 
in one’s hand – no matter where 
they are at currently. It lives in a 
high-society setting as well as on 
the streets for street photography. 
The Panasonic LUMIX GF9 will be 
available for RM 2,399.

id you know, apart from office-grace 
Multi-Function Printers (MFP), OKI also 
has large-format MFPs available on hand?
The need to print floorplans, CAD 
drawings to CAM blueprints and site plans is 
important for architectural, engineering and 
construction firms (AEC), as they rely on large-
format MFPs to print, scan, copy, distribute and 
archive industry documents quickly and easily. 
Having an MFP as part of the repertoire of any 
AEC enables these companies to produce high 
quality jobs for their clients, without any loss of 
productivity and performance. 
Older systems that relies on large-format 
printers and plotters can be unreliable to modern 
companies. They are slow, lag during usage and 
comes with a limited feature-set that modern 
AECs are looking for. They also lack key features 
that can help support better workflow such as 
networking and file sharing, which can impede 
companies in optimising their workflow for better 
work management off and on-site. 
Clients need fast access to the latest designs 
- but not all large-format printers can connect 
D
with customer networks and distribute designs 
electronically. In fact, inferior quality prints can 
make complex designs hard to decipher and lack 
important technical detail, delaying and negatively 
impacting client decisions. Not to mention that 
those large format printers takes up valuable space, 
which can be a premium at AEC offices off-and-on 
site. 
How can OKI MFP help companies?
Increasing productivity and reliability 
Not only OKI large-scale printers are reliable, 
they help in maximising companies’ uptime and 
productivity by featuring easy-to-use interfaces, 
superior quality consumables, automatic roll paper 
width detection, time-saving folding and stacking 
capabilities, and more.
Clear communication with customers
Going beyond the functionality of alternative 
printers and plotters, OKI large-format MFPs enable 
professionals to send scanned PDF data directly to 
a shared folder, making them ideal for archiving and

seamless electronic communication with customer 
networks.
Small size, big performance 
Thanks to a small footprint – up to 40% smaller 
when compared to competitive models, this allows 
the printers to be placed at convenient spot in 
the office without taking too much space. Plus, 
OKI large-format MFPs feature front-facing paper 
operations that enables them to be positioned 
against a wall and located in small workspaces, 
further maximising available space.
High quality prints every time
A big printer does not always equal high quality 
prints. With OKI, every print is a high-resolution 
print that is perfect for AEC applications. An

Oukitel is officially in 
Malaysia, with its affordable 
smartphones in tow
Brand will be aiming for the middle market who are looking for value-add products
new brand has entered the 
Malaysian market, and 
they are aiming for the big 
guys by offering similar 
features at a more affordable price. 
Oukitel is a brand that is gunning to 
be one of the brand to look out for 
in Malaysia. 
With their brand announcement 
locally, they will be bringing in 
several models to fit the needs and 
wants of users across the range and 
price band. The models they will be 
bringing are the K6000 Plus and the 
U16 Max. Their dual-camera phone, 
the U20, is already here, and you can 
read about it in our review here.

"Oukitel is 
a brand that 
is gunning 
to be one of 
the brand to 
look out for in 
Malaysia. "
 Bowman Qi, CEO of Oukitel (middle), flanked by representatives from Oukitel and Oukitel Malaysia at the launch of the brand
The K6000 Plus has a 5.5-inch Full 
HD display, a MediaTek MT6750T 
1.5GHz octa-core processor paired 
with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal 
storage, 16 megapixel rear and 8 
megapixel front-facing cameras, as 
well as a huge 6,080mAh battery. Yes 
you read that right – it is over twice 
of the standard high-end battery 
capacity that we see in some of the 
high end devices in the market now. 
The biggest drawback for having this 
much power is the size – it is very 
thick to hold. 
On the other hand the U16 Max, which 
has a 6-inch display, the same processor 
as the K6000 but with 3GB of RAM 
and 32GB of storage, a 13-megapixel 
rear shooter and a 5-megapixel selfie 
camera, and all the other amenities you 
would expect in a modern smartphone 
such as 4G connectivity. It also has a 
4000mAh batter that is substantial, but 
not unheard of. 
Both phones will have Android 7.0 
Nougat out of the box, which is very good 
for a smartphone to have these days. 
If you are looking to get one, the 
K6000 Plus will be retailing for RM 
999 and the U16 Max will be retailing 
at RM 889. Also introduced are two 
“smaller” phones – the C3 and C5 Pro, 
which will be priced at RM 299 and 
RM 399 respectively.

Millennials Travel Based on What 
They Can Share on Social Media
Expedia study shows social media posting is significant 
factor for millennials making travel decisions
ccording 
to 
a 
survey 
by 
Expedia, 
choosing 
location 
to 
travel 
is 
increasingly based on shareability 
online, as much as the authentic 
experience itself.
Expedia Malaysia released their 
findings on a recent survey relating 
to millennials and travelling. The 
survey, reflected in the 2017 Expedia 
Millennial 
Travel 
Report, 
was 
conducted 
with 
21,000 
people 
across 21 markets globally, including 
Malaysia. The survey focused on 
millenials, defined as those born 
between 1982 and 1999.
Based on the survey, millenials are 
increasingly holding back on investing 
in marriage and mortgages, instead 
opting to invest in travel experience. 
The Malaysian data showed that for 
over 72% of the respondent, the main 
driver for travel is for experiencing 
the authentic culture.
Interestingly, the deciding factor 
to where millennials choose to 
travel to, is increasingly about how 
shareable that location is. For over 
43% of the respondents, factors such 
as having comments and reactions 
on their vacation posts are either 
a significant (32%) or a deciding 
factor (11%) for choosing a holiday 
destination. Holiday plans are greatly 
influenced by social media postings, 
with 44% quoting holiday postings 
from friends affected travel decisions.
The 
biggest 
takeaway 
from 
the report is that millennials are 
demanding authentic, personalised, 
A
convenient 
and 
safe 
travel 
experiences. From the Malaysian data 
available, it was noted that concern 
for personal safety abroad was 
greater, at 60 percent compared to 
Singaporeans at 59 percent.
The report also observed that 
the influence of fellow consumers 
(review sites, blogs, travel forums) 
is the most important source of 
influence when it comes to their 
holiday decision-making – more 
so than close contacts (friends, 
family, social network contacts) and 
industry experts (travel agents, travel 
providers, expert opinion websites).
While talking to journalists about 
the report findings, Simon Fiquet, 
General Manager for Southeastasia 
and India, Expedia group notes that 
Expedia relies heavily on data to 
predict and make better suggestions 
for users booking through Expedia 
website. 
Simon 
told 
us 
that 
they are working on algorithms, 
integrating machine learning and 
artificial intelligence capabilities to 
personalise recommendations.
“Here at Expedia, we see 
ourselves as a technology company 
in the business of travel, and we 
leverage our powerful data & insights 
to deliver a personalized customer 
experiences that come with more 
choice, flexibility and reliability” 
Simon said. “Perhaps the most 
valuable insight we have gained 
from this Report is that by tailoring 
the experiences for the Millennial 
traveller, we stand to gain their trust 
for years to come, as indicated by the 
importance they place on the opinion 
of their peers whom they trust and 
find relatable”.
Capabilities like Scratchpad collects 
data and makes recommendation to 
users based on their previous search, 
giving advice on the best pricing 
expectation and best time for booking.
They’ve also recently tested out 
chatbots (automated chat assistants) 
on Skype and Facebook Messenger, to 
create a more interactive experience 
for planning holidays. While Expedia 
is still experimenting and improving 
on their chatbot systems, we can 
expect some information about user 
response in the coming months.

How memory of the past is shaping the future of mobile
Nostalgia-tinged 
MWC 2017 
By Sharil Abdul Rahman
very year Mobile World Congress (MWC) is the chosen platform for brands to showcase what is new and what is trending 
in the land of the mobile industry. This year is no different, with both big brands and unknown players vying to get their 
names out in the field. The underlying message this time around is reliving nostalgia, as brands are pushing old names to 
be relevant again.

COVER STORY
hen Mobile World 
Congress 2017 was 
first 
announced, 
no one expected 
that it will be the 
trade show where old becomes new 
again, at least in the consumer space. 
Within the span of just a few hours, 
an event that was expected to be 
routine turned into something special 
– at least for those who are into 
nostalgia. Two brands came out right 
of the gate, announcing new products 
after going quiet for quite some time. 
Blackberry and Nokia announced new 
mobile products that is set to change 
how people perceive their brands – at 
least for the next year or so.  
To 
the 
uninitiated, 
Mobile 
World Congress or also known 
as MWC is a yearly trade show 
located in Barcelona, and it is where 
brands show their latest technology 
to the world’s eye and where trade 
happens between companies from all 
over the world. Technologies such as 
4G, 5G, LTE and wireless charging first 
debuted in MWC, which has since 
become (or will become) household 
features that is part and parcel of the 
mobile scene. It is also where brands 
such as Samsung and Huawei usually 
strut their stuff to the world. 
Oddly enough this year the vibe 
at MWC is a bit different. Sure, 
there are companies like LG who 
showcased their latest smartphone – 
the LG G6 (which sadly may never see 
the Malaysian market), or Samsung 
with their Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 
series. However, the two biggest 
name that dominated the airwaves 
was Blackberry and Nokia.  
The two companies announced 
products 
that 
targeted 
the 
nostalgia seekers at the trade show, 
while at the same time use the hype 
to propel the brands back to the world 
spotlight. Blackberry’s KEYOne is the 
company’s last official smartphone 
built with their partner, TCL, as 
all other Blackberries from now 
onwards will be made under license. 
This model features the traditional 
QWERTY keyboard that is Blackberry 
made famous for, while running the 
Android operating system. 
Nokia meanwhile shocked the

world with the announcement of a 
“new” Nokia 3310, a reimagining of a 
classic smartphone made popular by 
the brad over a decade ago. This new 
Nokia does not share many elements 
with the older iteration but the spirit 
of the company lives on thanks to 
the current engineers, who are former 
Nokia employees.  
With these two brands, nostalgia 
is strong as they aim to attract both 
new and old customers who have 
heard of the brand before – even in 
passing. The hype of the Nokia 3310 
is so big, that mainstream news 
channels carried the news as if the 
second coming of technology is here. 
This is great for the brand, as it has 
instantly catapulted their name into 
the technosphere as more people 
are talking about the brand than ever 
before.  
The question on everyone’s lips 
– is this a good thing? Banking on a 
nostalgia hype to bring brands back to 
the fore may be good for the brand – 
or result in a catastrophic blowback 
that can result in irreversible damage 
to the brand in the long run. We have 
to wait and see if the current plan by 
these two companies will translate 
into sustainable sales of their new 
products, or it is just a flash in the 
pan.  
New at MWC 
Of course nostalgia is not the only 
thing on offer at MWC. Other 
companies came out with new and 
interesting products that we may 
see in Malaysia soon, or at least 
soon enough.  Companies like LG, 
Huawei and Samsung were there to 
showcase their latest product, some 
to great applause, and some with 
some confusion. 
There are also smaller companies 
who are using the same platform to 
announce their latest entry to the 
vast world of smartphones as well. 
Let’s see some of the new offerings 
on the table.
Huawei
The company from China presented 
their latest smartphone series on 
stage at Barcelona. The Huawei 
P10 and P10 Plus are upgrades to 
last year’s P9 series, with features 
that makes it a worthy successor 
to the line. With a newer processor 
(HiSilicon’s Kirin 960), the phone 
breezes through the competition line-
up – well, mostly. The biggest change 
however are the lenses on the larger 
P10 Plus series. This phone now 
features Leica’s Summilux lens that 
put it on par with many professional 
photography devices out there. 
First for the line are two new 
colours, made with the help of the 
Pantone Institute. Greenery and 
Dazzling Blue were introduced for 
the first time in the brand’s line-
up. Also new is the relocation of 
the fingerprint sensor to the front 
of the device, which is now also 
doing double duty as a touchpad for 
controls that are usually associated 
with the three Android buttons. 
The dual cameras are still around, 
with the black and white sensor 
getting a bump to a 20-megapixel 
sensor. As stated before, the larger 
P10 Plus now feature the new Leica 
lens, with a f/1.8 aperture for better 
bokeh and low-light performance.

COVER STORY
LG 
The big news from the company is their LG G6 
smartphone. In all aspect, it is a great flagship – 
Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, 4GBs of RAM and so 
on. What makes this phone stand out from the 
crowd however is the use of a 2:1 ratio screen – 
a first in any smartphone out there. LG also has 
managed to cram the large screen into a body no 
bigger than last year’s Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. 
This means that the phone is comfortable to 
hold in one hand, and will not cause any cramps 
whatsoever. The screen also feature rounded 
edges, that LG claims will reduce the impact 
received by the screen if it ever drops onto the 
ground; plus, it looks great when compared to 
square-edges on most smartphones these days. LG 
is also a proponent of dual camera technology, with 
the phone now sporting dual 13-megapixel cameras 
that can act like a zoom lens when in use. The f/1.8 
lenses also helps in low-light situations. 
Wiko
Hailing from France, Wiko was also at MWC to 
showcase their latest smartphone to the world. 
The Upulse line is their latest smartphone, which 
was designed to be their new take on a multimedia 
experience device for the masses. 
Unique features include a rear 13-megapixel 
camera that can create high-definition 52-megapixel 
images on demand, a large 5.5-inch display and a 
good mid-tier specs sheet. All of these in a modern 
and premium-looking metal body that makes it look 
premium in the market. 
Sony
While the company is not the big name it once used 
to be, they were still in force at MWC, announcing 
a couple of interesting designs and products. One 
of which is the new Xperia XZ Premium, which 
features a 5.5-inch 4K display that supports HDR 
videos, a crazy 19-megapixel camera that can 
capture 960 fps slomo video, and the first phone to 
be announced with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. 
The Xperia Touch meanwhile is something 
that is totally different that it garners a mention. 
Basically, it is a projector that has Android built-
in, and the built-in infrared sensor can detect your 
finger movement and turn it into, well, Android 
input. Also, when you need it to be larger, just 
reposition the projector and it can project up to 80 
inches in size. It also works with the PS4’s Remote 
Play feature, meaning you can use it to game 
over the internet if someone else is using the TV 
attached to your console.
Oppo 
While they did not showcase any new smartphones 
at MWC, Oppo did show us a new concept in 
smartphone photography. They combined lenses, 
prisms and sensors to create a compact optical 
zoom technology for smartphones. 
The system works by flipping the lens 90 degrees, 
and using the prism, it works like a periscope to 
capture the image and light into the sensor, and this 
works like a 5X optical zoom lens system. What’s 
more, the whole module lies flush with the back of 
the smartphone so no ungainly camera bumps can be 
seen when the phone is in the hands.

Nokia
Apart from the relaunch of the iconic 3310, Nokia 
announced three new smartphones at their launch 
event. When we say three, it is two new models 
and a global version of the other. The Nokia 3, 
5 and 6 are the company’s ticket back into the 
smartphone market.
The phones are not what you would call high-
end smartphones, but when there is still a large 
market out there who are still transitioning from a 
feature phone (like the new 3310) to a smartphone, 
it is something to think about as Nokia aims for 
them. 
Blackberry
If you miss the QWERTY keyboard, the Blackberry 
KEYOne will fulfil the needs for physical touch 
and click buttons on a smartphone. The new 
phone from Blackberry shares more features 
with mid-tier smartphones than flagships, but the 
Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC will ensure that 
the phone gets great battery performance with 
every charge. 
This will be the last phone that Blackberry 
will be creating with their partner, with all other 
phones from now on made under licence. Will this 
be a good thing for Blackberry? We shall find out 
soon enough. 
What does the editor at PC.com thinks of 
MWC 2017?
Sharil – This year looks to be an evolution to some 
brands, and revolution to others. The Huawei P10 
is an evolution from the previous P9, and it looks 
to be something that will be good for certain 
segments of the market. Nostalgia is powerful – I 
want to buy the Nokia 3310 the moment it hits 
Malaysian shores – but we need more innovation 
to make the industry great again, if you pardon the 
quip.  
Wiliam – With MWC 2017 done and dusted, 
a few key points to take away from it was the 
return of the original giants who once ruled the 
market - Nokia and BlackBerry. Although one can 
comment on how it is a bit too soon to say if these 
two companies can achieve the same amount 
of greatness as before, it is great to see these 
two back in the game once again. Through MWC 
2017, BlackBerry re-introduces  its once-appealing 
keyboard, now with added features and Nokia 
bringing nostalgia back with a revamped 3310.
Satoko – On the technology side we see much 
talks revolving around 5g and IoT , but most 
remain as that - talks and plans. It's difficult for 
the market to get excited when companies are 
stuck talking about figures. Nokia had won this 
round with the nostalgic factor, with LG appealing 
to the masses through marketing their phones as 
an answer to consumer wishlists. By looking at 
the hype, we see consumer interest plateauing 
towards the new features of the smartphone but 
jumping at 'older' technology.

AMD Ryzen 1800X
More Cores than You Can 
Ever Want
The Ryzen 1800X features 8 cores, 
and now with AMD, they have what 
they call Simultaneous Multi-Threading 
(SMT) – basically you can have two 
logical cores for the price of one 
physical core – so you get 16 running 
threads with each processor. This is 
great for applications that thrives on 
multi-thread processing.
Save on Power
If you are looking for a power saving 
processor – this may not be the 
ultimate choice. However AMD has 
managed to make this processor a 
bit more power friendly – it sports 
a 95-watt TDP, making it one of the 
more power efficient high performance 
processor around. 
Zen Your Performance
Thanks to the new Zen architecture on 
the Ryzen chips, performance levels 
are up. We managed to get really good 
scores in our test benchmarks – and 
these are raw performance numbers. 
We will have to wait and see when 
software companies will fully optimize 
their software but the chip is showing 
some promises down the road.

VERDICT: “ You are getting a lot more than what you are paying with the new Ryzen CPUs.” - Sharil
Better than Expected
The chip has a default clockspeed of 
3.6GHz, and a boost of up to 4.1GHz. 
The new chip delivers more than 
52% improvement in delivering more 
Instructions per Clock (IPC), which 
exceeded their previous generation as 
well as their forecasted target (they 
aimed an increase of only 40% when 
compared to the last generation).
Unlock Everything 
Out of the box, all Ryzen processors 
are unlocked and can be overclocked. 
Yes, all of the chips from now on will 
be overclockable by the end users. 
Apart from that, AMD also features a 
new collection of technologies baked 
into the Zen architecture itself called 
SenseMI (Sense+M+I, not SenseMe). 
Wallet Friendly
The closest competitor 
to this chip is about two 
times the price – so this 
is value for money

Neffos is Back
Neffos X1
Worth Iis Weight
I wouldn’t go so far as to say the X1 
is a horrible smartphone. Quite the 
contrary, it’s a pretty decent device, 
ranging from an entry-level to mid-
range spectrum, depending on which 
variation you’d go for. My suggestion 
would be to splurge on the 3GB 
RAM so you can have that bit more 
processing power and being able to 
just to do more with the X1. Although 
the benchmarks aren’t impressive, 
the X1 is more than capable of 
running through your usual social 
media apps, YouTube and many 
others without any problems.
Snap Away
The X1 comes with a Sony IMX258 
sensor with 13-megapixels, making it 
an above average camera in a very 
affordable price. Although pictures 
don’t turn out spectacular, it’s still 
much better than many other entry-
level devices. Night-time shooting is 
a lot better as it can capture more 
light while the front-facing camera 
comes with a Beautify option. Now 
you can fool your Instagram followers 
into thinking you have flawless skin 
and that you’re exceptionally good-
looking when it fact you suffer from 
a lack of acceptance from society (I 
may be talking about myself in this 
case). 
Easy Unlocking 
Process
The fingerprint scanner on 
the X1 is located at its back, 
making unlocking the device 
a natural and extremely easy 
process. Also, did I forget to 
mention that it unlocks in an 
instant?!
Aww, No Type-C?
Sadly, the X1 only comes with 
a micro-USB port and not a 
Type-C port, which makes it a 
bit of a letdown.

Exceeding my 
Expectations
I was thoroughly disappointed with 
the Neffos C5; to be blunt, I didn’t 
think it deserved to be considered 
a smartphone. However, the X1 
has changed my perception of 
Neffos. While the X1 isn’t the best 
smartphone of this year, it does set 
itself apart from the crowd with its 
dual-curved metallic back cover. It 
also gives off a very natural fit into 
your palm without any chance of 
slipping, a major plus for a klutz like 
me.

Your Best Mate
Huawei Mate 9
Double the Fun 
Speaking of the camera, the Mate 
9 now houses a dual camera, which 
is the result of Huawei’s hallmark 
partnership with Leica. Unlike its first 
rendition of the dual cameras in the 
P9 series, the phablet-sized device 
features vertically stacked lenses, 
with better monochrome resolution 
to boot.
Still a Handful
As a person with small hands, the 
5.5-inch P9 Plus was just about 
pushing my grip threshold. The 
5.9-inch Mate 9 is still a behemoth 
in hand. Comparatively to the Mate 
8, the dimensions and weight are 
almost similar – the Mate 9 is smaller 
and lighter but the difference is 
negligible. 
Fast Charging Made 
Faster
It houses a huge 4,000mAh 
battery and further enhanced by 
its fast charging (SuperCharge) 
capabilities and newly added 
USB-C connectivity
On the Inside
The Mate 9 still features a full HD 
display; a stark difference between 
the latter and its predecessor is that 
the Mate 9 doesn’t sport an IPS-NEO 
LCD panel. The display was crisp 
and bright, watching videos and 
playing games on the Mate 9 certainly 
gives off a premium feeling. It also 
offers users more power and better 
performance as it houses the latest 
Kirin 960 chipset and Mali G71 GPU. 
Performance was snappy, with any 
form of multi-tasking not weighing 
down the device at all. For reference, 
I usually run about 7 to 8 apps in the 
background at the very minimum.

‘Same Same’, but Different
Huawei has found a winning 
aesthetic for its Mate series and 
they’re stick with it. Place them 
side-by-side, and from the front, you 
will realise that both the Mate 8 and 
Mate 9 could be doppelgangers. If 
you don’t look hard enough, you 
could very easily mistake them for 
one or the other. A tell-tale sign is 
the camera.

Compact Wunderkind 
Sony RX100 Mk V
Small yet Powerful
Thanks to the combination of the 
1-inch sensor and the BION X image 
processor, the Sony RX100 Mk V is 
Sony’s best compact ever. It has great 
image quality out of the box – and for 
something this small, it is incredible to 
see photos looking similar to bigger 
cameras. 
4K Recording
Yes, this camera can easily record 4K 
video. Thanks to Sony’s expertise in 4K 
videography, what they have learned 
has been translated into the features 
that you can see in the RX100 Mk V 
like S-Log2 for massive dynamic range 
capture, focus peaking, and zebras. 
These features, combined with the lens 
makes the RX100 Mk V a very capable 
video camera on the go.
Zeiss All the Way
The now standard 24-70mm on the 
RX100 series is still one of the best set 
of lenses that anyone can own for any 
camera out there. Designed by Zeiss, 
it has great image reproduction, not to 
mention colour clarity with every press 
of the shutter button. 
Adjust
The control ring on the 
front is still useful, but 
we prefer a touchscreen
Easy Transfer
You get NFC and WiFi so 
transferring images is a 
touch and a snap.

VERDICT: “ A go-anywhere camera that is beyond its paygrade, with nitpicks” - Sharil
Come on, Focus Already…
One drawback of the RX100 MKv is 
that the autofocus system is similar 
(if not the same) as with the previous 
models. It can focus correctly, but not 
at lightning speeds. It will take a bit of 
time to get it right, but when it is right, 
the shot is guranteed to be a winner. 
Touchscreen Doko?
One glaring omission that Sony neglected 
to fix is the inclusion of a touch screen. This 
is compounded with the fact that it has the 
first phase detection autofocus (PDAF) 
for a compact camera – yet it needs to be 
controlled by delving too deep into menus 
and options. A direct touchscreen control will 
make everything better – trust us on this.

a 4000mAh battery, which lasts 
comfortably for a day or more. For 
daily usage of navigation, browsing 
internet, emails, texts and calls, it will 
carry on for a day or more without 
needing to top up.
Reactive Performance
While the benchmark scores 
doesn’t show it, the phone is pretty 
reactive to general operations on 
the phone. Swapping between 
apps, checking emails, browsing 
social media – it works perfectly 
with negligible lag. However, for 
any graphics heavy applications 
– it does tend to load rather 
slowly. Plus point – as far as I

Out-of-place Fingerprint Sensor
I’d much rather prefer the fingerprint sensor on the 
A9s to be at the back of the device rather than the 
front as it just doesn’t feel natural when holding it

Battery Life
The battery life on 
the A9s is subpar

turn on the pre-
installed Boost+ 
feature to maintain 
your battery life 
but it will affect 
the performance 
drastically.

HTC One A9s
Same Shape, Same Design
Not to put off the hard work the 
people over at HTC have put into 
the HTC One A9s, but it is eerily 
reminiscent of the Apple iPhone 6s, 
and that isn’t necessarily a good 
thing. It’s 2017, not everybody 
is into the small smartphones 
these days (no, I am not 
overcompensating for something). 
What I must commend the A9s 
on is its sturdy metallic body with 
non-protruding buttons, giving it 
a minimalistic outlook and feel in 
your palms.

Bye-bye Bloatware
What HTC has done well with its 
Android devices is limit the bloatware 
that comes with it to a minimum. 
The HTC Sense OS on the A9s keeps 
the overall UI of the device simple 
and easy to navigate, especially if 
you’re an existing Android user. It also 
comes with HTC Freestyle layout, 
allowing you to customise and get 
creative with your home screen with 
layers of widgets, apps and icons. The 
world – or your home screen – is your 
oyster.
Creating Memories 
with a Click
The focus point of the A9s is 
course its 13-megapixel camera 
paired with a BSI sensor. I wouldn’t 
say pictures would turn out 
spectacularly great but it’s a lot 
better compared to many other 
mid-range devices in the market. 
From my experience, low-lighting 
conditions as well as night shots 
are what brings the best out of the 
A9s. the 5-megapixel front-facing 
camera isn’t too shabby either but 
it does appear very grainy and 
pixelated in low-lighting.

Thanks to the small size of the

Acer ET430K 4K IPS Monitor
Aesthetically Pleasing
Unlike Acer’s Predator range of 
gaming monitors, its ET430K monitor 
exudes a more sophisticated and 
classy design – one that fits into the 
design aesthetics of most homes. I 
believe if you were to replace your TV 
in the living room with this monitor, 
most would be none the wiser. 
It uses a more minimalistic approach, 
with clean lines and thin bezel/
frame on the front. The stand lends 
a hand in making this monitor look 
more premium that it actually is, but 
I do have concerns whether it won’t 
topple over if you accidentally knock 
the table. 
4K for All 
One thing that surprised me about 
the ET430K is the price. It gives users 
a chance to own a 4K monitor for a 
fraction of the price of one 4K TV. 
Whether you’re a gamer or creative 
professionals, having this monitor will 
spoil you. I paired this with my Sony 
PlayStation 4 Pro and I was glued to 
my seat (and screen) for quite some 
time – it made gameplays that much 
more enjoyable. HDR content also 
looked amazing on screen.   
Mirror, 
Mirror on 
the Wall
That’s one posh 
mirror. But in 
all seriousness, 
you could wall 
mount it to save 
any heartaches 
caused by its 
precarious stand. 
Ports Ahoy 
There is a 
large selection 
of ports 
available on the

The idea of a monitor being as big

for TVs and not monitors. There 
were several times I was corrected 
(thanks, Sharil) when I called the 
Acer ET430K 4K IPS Monitor a TV. 
Having a monitor this huge is a rarity 
to be honest. I personally welcome 
the ET430K with open arms 
especially with the affordable cost 
of ownership. Now, to just get used

M for Maestro
The sound quality on the Moto M is 
far greater than I expected. It made 
watching Netflix and YouTube much 
better after I solved the overheating 
issue by just not touching the 
device. The Dolby Atmos audio 
enhancement does a great job at 
making whatever you watch sound 
better. The camera also does itself 
justice with a 16-megapixel rear 
camera and dual CCT flash. It also 
comes with an 8-megapixel selfie 
camera so it’s a great smartphone 
for girls. 
Splash Away
The Moto M is protected 
against accidental spills 
and splashes thanks 
to its invisible layer of 
nanocoating, making it 
resistant to water.
Keeping Personal 
Away From 
Professional
Thanks to the Dual-SIM 
slot, you can now have two 
different SIM cards in the Moto 
M, allowing you to reach your 
friends, family and colleagues 
without needing another 
device.
More Juice In Less 
Time
With the Type-C USB port, 
you can charge the Moto M 
faster while its battery will last 
longer, allowing you to have 
more fun with it.
M for Mid-range
Even after the acquisition from 
Lenovo back in 2014, Motorola has 
been putting out smartphones, 
ranging from high-end to entry 
level. The Moto M however, falls 
in-between the two categories. 
Standing at 5.5-inches, the Moto M is 
a great mid-range smartphone with 
respectable specs at an affordable 
price point. But whether it’s great 
is another matter entirely. It’s 
streamlined design paired with a 
solid metal body gave it a premium 
and classy look while remaining 
comfortable to have in your hands. 
M for Minimalism
The Moto M keeps its looks to a 
minimal; with that said, what’s under 
the hood is a different story entirely. 
Although the benchmarks may point 
it between a mid-range to an entry 
level device, the Moto M is a good 
device in its own right. Although 
I much prefer it to be running on 
Snapdragon, the Helio P10 performs 
admirably. The 4GB RAM isn’t so 
bad either as apps run smoothly in 
the background. My only concern is 
the overheating, which is something 
the Moto M tends to do when you’re 
using it for long hours.

Keeping It Curvy
 Acer Predator X34 Gaming Monitor
Lag Will Never be an Issue
Provided you’re using the latest 
GeForce GTX GPU’s, you would never 
have a problem with screen tearing or 
stuttering ever again as the Predator 
X34 comes with NVIDIA G-Sync 
Technology. By syncing frames 
rendered by your GPU to the refresh 
rate on the monitor (which can be 
overclocked to a maximum of 100Hz), 
the Predator X34 makes every game 
look like a real beauty to behold. It 
made GTA V look like a dream while 
Horizon Zero Dawn was exceptionally 
amazing to watch.
View Everything in 
Colourful detail
Screen colour quality any way you 
like. This allows you to keep the 
profiles for specific games that 
require precise colour adjustments. 
This is also because of the advanced 
IPS panel located in the Predator X34, 
giving the colours a vivid outlook. 
This is one gaming monitor you must 
get your hands on if you have the 
money for it; it looks like a dream and 
works even better. 
Let the 
Monitor do 
the Tilting 
for You
Not only can 
you view the 
Predator x34 
from wide 
angles, you 
can also tilt the 
screen upwards 
and downwards 
as well as adjust 
its height to fit 
your preference.
 
Lighting Up 
Your Life
Sharing the 
same space with 
the speakers, 
the Predator 
X34 also comes 
with LED 
underglow, 
which is also 
customisable to 
suit your mood.
Built-in Audio 
Goodness
Located at bottom of the 
monitor, the Predator X34 
comes with two 7-watt 
speakers with Dolby DTS 
audio enhancement so you 
wouldn’t have to splurge on 
external speakers.

Curvy in All the 
Right Places
The Acer Predator X34 is an 
insanely gorgeous curved gaming 
monitor. As I’ve always said, I have 
a thing for curves (explains my 
current girlfriend). 34-inches wide, 
the Predator X34 comes with a 
borderless design, allowing you to 
get the most out of it. If only we had 
a few more and we could’ve daisy-
chained a couple of X34’s together 
to get a level of immersion like never 
before. It’s ultra-wide QHD display 
screen comes with a cinematic 21:9 
aspect ratio, making it the perfect 
gaming monitor for RPG and action-
adventure games which are heavily 
reliant on its graphics.

the Acer Predator X34.” - Wi-Liam

Wallet Friendly Dual Camera 
Oukitel U20 Plus
Dual Camera
Given that it is a mid-range phone, 
it does come with a rather decent 
dual camera setup. Fitted with 
a 13MP+0.3MP at the rear, it lets 
you play around with the aperture 
settings giving you an SLR type 
photography experience. The 5MP 
front is not too shabby, holding up 
decently for a selfie. 
Lacking in Performance
While it does your day-to-day tasks 
pretty well, anything a little bit more 
does seize it up. Using the navigation 
apps could be frustrating when the 
GPS signal keeps dropping. Trying 
an alternative route, it doesn’t always 
detect and recalculate. Not sure if it’s 
a faulty device, or a GPS fault. (Phone 
tested side by side with another 
phone on same connection without

there is a battery saver mode that 
would keep your phone going longer. 
Let’s say you’re in an extreme pinch

Creativity on the Go
Wacom Mobilestudio Pro 13
Tablet on Steroids 
I’ve been eyeing a certain fruit 
branded tablet and its pencil for the 
longest of time. What’s stopping me 
is that it is essentially an oversized 
smartphone; the mobile environment 
doesn’t give me the flexibility and 
productivity I need day to day. When 
the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 13 
came into the PC.com test lab, I was 
quick to snatch it up. However, the 
price of the unit almost gave me a 
heart attack. 
Windows of Opportunities
The MobileStudio Pro 13 takes the 
best from the brand’s Cintiq series 
of tablet and incorporated it into a 
Windows ecosystem. The device is a 
full-featured Intel-powered computer 
that can run all your productivity and 
creative apps. This particular model 
features the 6th Gen i7 processor, 
with a 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM 
– giving creative professionals 
a powerful machine, which also 
happens to be a tablet. 
A Suite of Applications 
Being in the publishing line, I’ve 
learned that my notebooks need to 
be able to handle both productivity 
and creative apps simultaneously. 
Running my Office suite and Adobe 
Creative Cloud was a breeze of the 
MobileStudio Pro; there was hardly 
any lag when switching between 
Premier, InDesign, Photoshop and 
Microsoft Word. I was doing my 
usual browsing on Chrome as well. 
Decluttering Devices
If you’re constantly on the go, 
having one of these babies in 
your design arsenal will definitely 
declutter the number of devices you 
have in your bag. Imagine whipping 
out your laptop, then your tablet, 
and then other miscellaneous cables 
and accessories, when working out 
of the office. With the MobileStudio 
Pro, all you need is your device, the 
Wacon Pro Pen 2 and your USB-C 
charger cable.

Keeping You Up All Night
Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 Smart Wi-Fi Router
Designed for Greatness
Netgear have outdone themselves 
with the Nighthawk X10 router. 
Although it encompasses a larger 
rectangular footprint than most, The 
X10 ensures that space wouldn’t be 
an issue as its dark and ever-present 
outlook is more than enough to keep 
you happy. It also comes with four 
angulated antennas and the first 
router I’ve seen with its own cooling 
fan. This is when you know that 
Netgear means business.
What Lag?
Located at the back of the X10 is 
seven Gigabit ports, which consist 
of six LAN ports and one WAN port. 
What makes the X10 great is its 
‘Aggregate Mode’ located on the 
first and second port. This allows you 
to combine throughput for double 
speed, making your 4K streaming, 
gaming and even downloads faster 
than ever. Even the technology found 
in the X10 is audacious; it comes with 
Wi-Fi 802.11ac and 11ad, which gave 
me over 4Gb/ps download speed!
Easy and Speedy Wireless 
Transfers
With the help of 11ad and easy 
cloud access, the X10 helps you 
in transferring data and files over 
Wi-Fi easy and speedy. After 
transferring over 500GB worth of 
movies from my external hard drive

Truly Wireless Security
Arlo Security System with 2 HD 
Cameras (VMS3230)
Flexible Monitoring
While the base station remains 
next to your network device at all 
times, these palm-sized cameras can 
easily be moved around the house…
depending on where you install the 
magnetic camera mounts. In the 
box, you will receive four mounts, 
which means you can decide up to 
four vantage points – both indoors 
and outdoors. This requires a little 
bit of drilling (or screwing in if 
you’re lucky) and the mounts are 
permanent. The only thing you move 
are the cameras themselves.
Viewing Limitations
A point of contention for me is the 
fact that its wire-less cameras do 
not use rechargeable batteries. I 
had found that continuous usage of 
the camera – I didn’t opt to record 
when there’s motion – will deplete 
the battery rather quickly. It does 
have digital pan and zoom, but it is 
a limited field of vision. There is also 
no audio recording capabilities. 
In the Cloud 
Aside from being wire-less, the Arlo 
does away with an internal storage 
system. Recorded video will get 
uploaded to its cloud system, where 
the basic service is free for a cloud 
recording of up to 1GB and will be 
stored there for seven days. Though 
this particular bundle on furnishes 
you with two cameras, it is easily 
scalable – the basic service can 
support up to five cameras. Should 
you require more space (up to 
100GB) and cameras supported (up 
to 15 cameras), you will need to pay a 
certain premium.

quick and easy.

A Colourful Entry to PC Building

Simple Layout
The Battle AXE is a microATX

their next PC build
Simple Operations 
If you are looking for overclocking 
– look elsewhere. Thanks to the 
B-series chipset, the capabilities of 
the board is not equal to the Z-series 
boards out there. Even the memory 
option is limited – you get two DIMM 
slots, for dual channel memory 
operations. Nothing more, nothing 
lese
Simple Collection Of I/O
The expected list of ports is present 
– USB 3.0, HDMI and even VGA. 
Unfortunately, this board is not that

Space Saving Soundbar
Philips Fidelio B1 Soundbar
Tiny & Mighty
Unlike most soundbars in the market 
right now, Philips has gone to a 
different route with its Fidelio B1, 
making it significantly smaller; I 
guess size isn’t everything, said no 
girl ever. It measures at just 41cm in 
length so it doesn’t take up much 
space or steal the attention away 
from your TV. This makes setting up 
a lot easier, especially if you have 
other gadgets and gizmos like a 
gaming console or a DVD player, 
which will take up more space.
Perfect for Movies
Phillips dubs the Fidelio B1 as a 
‘Nano cinema speaker’, and they 
were right, to a certain extent. The 
B1 houses four high-sensitivity 
speakers – two at its centre and 
two at its sides; this gives you a 
great, compact and dynamic sound, 
especially for movies. There are 
also two tweeters located at the 
top of the soundbar, which helps to 
increase the overall audio quality. 
Watching The Avengers: Civil War – 
which is in Blu-Ray, mind you – was 
great as the sound was impactful 
and made every scene a lot more 
powerful because of it.
Two for the Price of One 
With just one HDMI OUT cable, you can 
connect the Fidelio B1 to your TV with a non-
3D AV receiver so you can get great picture 
with equally superior audio quality.
Wireless 
Subwoofer
The subwoofer 
that comes with 
the Fidelio B1 can 
be connected 
wirelessly so it 
doesn’t necessarily 
have to sit next to 
the soundbar. It’s 
equally small frame 
and size is also a 
plus point.more 
secure fit.

Not so Great for Music
As great as it is for movies, the 
Fidelio B1 doesn’t perform as well 
when it comes to playing music. 
After connecting my smartphone to 
play from Spotify, the sound wasn’t 
as great as I had hoped. Although 
electronic music sounded more than 
just okay thanks to the deep bass 
from the subwoofer, other genres 
paled in comparison. Another note 
to highlight is that the Fidelio B1 
best performs in smaller rooms as

In this day and age, everyone and their grandparents are on the Internet. With access to countless information at our 
fingertips, it’s easy to get side-tracked when you’re browsing the World Wide Web. This, in turn, leaves us prone to malicious 
attacks if we’re not properly protected. As more and more antivirus protection programs keep popping up, you will find 
yourself wondering which is the best to suit your needs. This will also beg the question on whether you are willing to pay 
for an antivirus program or does a free version work just fine for you? For this month’s showdown, we’re comparing the 
differences between free and paid version of antivirus and which will be the best for you.

ESET Smart 
Security Premium
e start off with the Slovakian IT security giants known as ESET, 
who have been in the game for quite some time now. Named after 
the Egyptian goddess of health, marriage and love, ESET’s Smart 
Security Premium is an all-in-one security program that promises 
ultimate protection for every day web browsing and even provides security for 
online banking. This ensures that your online transactions are safe and secure 
while protecting your personal data.
W
Aside from purchasing a physical copy of the ESET Smart Security Premium, 
you can also purchase it through the website. It offers a 1-year or 2-year 
protection at the price of RM164.50 and RM246.80 respectively. Both packages 
offer you up to four different users with the Smart Security Premium so you can 
keep your friends and family protected as well.
Although the Smart Security Premium doesn’t cover other devices like 
smartphones, it can keep your laptop/PC safe and secure. One key feature that 
the Smart Security Premium offers, which ESET’s other antivirus solutions do 
not is being able to safely store your online passwords and encrypting your data 
so only you will have access to them. ESET Smart Security Premium also offers 
security in the form of protecting your Wi-Fi router and even your computer’s 
webcam. If there are any potential threats incoming, ESET will be the first to 
know and will notify you immediately.
There are two ways you can go about encrypting your data – virtually 
or through a removable hard drive. If you choose to encrypt through a virtual 
drive, ESET will create a virtual drive on your computer that encrypts all the 
data stored inside. The virtual drive will act and look similarly to a disk drive 
when activated. All the encrypted files can only be opened once you key in 
your password. The same protocol is used through a removable drive where 
a protected folder will be created onto said drive and can only be accessed 
through a password.
Another feature of the Smart Security Premium that is great for laptop 
users is its Anti-Theft feature, which helps to protect your laptop and in the 
case of theft, can also locate the laptop. Once you enable through ESET’s anti-
theft website that your device is either lost or stolen, it will begin tracking your 
device while taking regular camera pictures as well as screenshots so you will 
know who stole it and what they are doing with it. This is a great anti-theft tool 
to have as most stolen devices can almost always never be found again.

Kaspersky Internet 
Security
ext up, we have Kaspersky Lab, a popular household name when it 
comes to cybersecurity and antivirus protection. This Russian-based 
multinational company started out in 1997 and is currently one of the 
most popular antivirus protection programs right now. Named after its 
founder, Eugene Kaspersky (who came up with Kaspersky’s first antivirus software 
in response to the Cascade virus), Kaspersky Internet Security is also an all-in-one 
security program that provides total protection to your PC as well as your other 
devices.
N
Kaspersky offers a wide range of offers for its Internet Security 
package where you can choose to have a one- or two-year plan across 
a total of up to five different devices. This way, you can protect your 
PC, smartphone, tablet and two additional devices of your choice. Priced 
from RM105 for one device, RM169 for three devices and RM253 for five 
devices, Kaspersky offers great value for money as you can have more 
devices protected for a longer time.
Kaspersky Internet Security also provides you a safe space to conduct 
online transactions and banking through its Safe Money application. 
This allows you to include your online banking website and even credit/
debit card details through Safe Money and not have to worry about your 
personal data being deciphered. Kaspersky Internet Security also provides 
webcam security, much like what ESET Smart Security Premium.
To make it clearer, the Kaspersky Internet Security is considered 
its mid-tier program whilst the Kaspersky Total Security is its top-tier 
program so trying to justify between the ESET Smart Security Premium 
and Kaspersky Internet Security will come under much scrutiny. With that 
said, Kaspersky Total Security comes with identical features from Internet 
Security but with an added three features that makes it different from 
the latter.
These three features include Extended protection for your children 
across all devices, secured password storage, which can be accessed 
across multiple devices and data encryption and backup for photos, 
videos, music and other files. The Total Security program also runs the 
same as how the Internet Security package works where you can choose 
to have a one- or two-year plan across a total of five different devices. 
However, there is a drastic price increase between the two as Total 
Security is priced from RM353 to RM1325.

AVG Antivirus 
Free
ormerly known as just AVG (abbreviated from Anti-Virus Guard), AVG 
AntiVirus is most popularly famous for its family of antivirus and internet 
security software developed by AVG Technologies who is a subsidiary 
of Avast Software. AVG AntiVirus is most notably famous for providing 
top-quality ‘freeware’, which protects your PC and other devices from potential 
threats and malware.
F
Right off the bat, AVG Antivirus Free doesn’t offer much as compared to the 
paid antivirus programs, and rightly so. However, it does offer basic protection for 
your computer, your web browsing and even your email.  By clicking on the Settings 
icon right next to ‘Scan Computer’ on the home screen, it will redirect you to a more 
detailed window about your scanning options. From here, you can perform a full 
computer, performance, deep virus, USB/DVD or a file and folder scan. For a free 
antivirus software, that is extensive in terms of computer scanning.
If you ever wanted to permanently delete files from your PC (let’s face it, it’s 
porn; if you don’t have a VPN, finding porn online is a task in itself), AVG Antivirus 
Free will do that for you. Simply select which file or folder you’d like to delete from 
and it’ll be permanently gone from your computer. 
Sadly, to get the most out of AVG Technologies, you will have to purchase 
the full program online for a yearly fee of RM200. If you want the best that 
AVG Technologies has to offer, you can also check out AVG Ultimate, which 
combines every Internet Security feature alongside AVG’s TuneUp feature for a 
yearly fee of RM280.

s the name clearly states, Windows Defender is a pre-installed anti-
malware component that comes with Microsoft Windows. Although 
first introduced as an antispyware program that is free to download 
for Windows XP, it was then shipped to Windows Vista and Windows 
7 before being turned into a full antivirus program from Windows 8 and onwards, 
replacing Microsoft Security Essentials.
A
Seeing as Windows Defender already comes pre-installed into a Windows 
PC, you won’t have to scour the Internet for another antivirus program. Its 
scan is great as you can choose between three different options – Quick, Full 
and Custom. As its name suggest, Quick scan will go through your device to 
ensure there are no anomalies while Full scan will make sure there aren’t any 
irregularities. Custom scan allows you to choose which disc you want to scan 
and which you want to leave out.
Windows Defender also provides Real-time and Cloud-based protection 
to your PC and even Automatic Samples Submission. Real-time and Cloud-
based protection helps to find and stop malware from installing and running 
itself on your PC. It will then send info to Microsoft about any potential threats 
that may occur. This in turn will help Microsoft improve malware detection. 
This would be great for all of you out there who like to partake in your usual 
night time streaming sessions (you know what I’m talking about).

CONCLUSION
After running through all four antivirus programs (and having to restart my PC every time I switch between them), there is no clear-cut winner here as every internet user 
has different needs and wants when it comes to having an antivirus program.
If you’re looking for a security software that protects you from all type of potential threats while providing safe and secure online banking and transactions, encrypting 
all your data, keeping your children safe from potential harm and even safely storing passwords, the ESET Smart Security Premium is the one for you.
However, if you want to be able to keep all your devices safe and secure, have parental control on the PC and secure online transactions and banking, maybe the 
Kaspersky Labs Internet Security is the right fit for you.
But if you don’t feel like paying for an antivirus programs, the AVG Antivirus Free is a great freeware software that does a great job in keeping your PC safe. From being 
able to perform various types of scans as well as shredding files, AVG has got you covered. But if you just don’t want to download any freeware or pay for them, Windows 
Defender is perfectly fine as it can still provide virus and malware protection and removal as well as spyware detection and removal.

tips to break free of the confined idea space
When you have been photographing for a while, there are bound to be times when you fall into a creative rut or slump. While it is also good to take your time 
and slowly ride it out, I would like to introduce several methods at various levels you can practice with. I would also recommend them as a way of getting 
better, even for those of you who haven’t hit the wall.

IDEAS FOR SELF-IMPOSED SHOOTING RESTRICTIONS

Impose some restrictions when 
shooting
It is well-known that daring to limit yourself to 
not using special functions is very effective for 
producing creative shots. The same applies to 
cameras in that the more sophisticated they 
become, the more it feels like your photos were 
“taken with a camera” - so it is often the case 
that you always take the same kinds of photos in 
accordance with the camera’s functions.
Therefore, choosing just one of the camera’s 
convenient functions and keeping it at a fixed 
setting could create new, thrilling challenges that 
motivate you and push you out of your rut.
Basic: Acquire a sense of distance 
by limiting the focal length
Perhaps the easiest method to start with is to limit 
the focal length.
For those of you with a zoom lens, try restricting 
yourself from using the zoom. While the kit 
lens that comes with your camera at the time of 
purchase will typically have a zoom range of 18-
55mm, 18-135mm, etc., try using this zoom lens as 
a prime lens.
I recommend limiting yourself to the three focal 
lengths of 35mm, 50mm, and 70mm at 35mm film-
equivalent. These are the typical focal lengths of 
wide-angle, standard, and moderate telephoto 
lenses. The above focal lengths are for use with 
a full frame camera, so if you are using a APS-C 
camera, refer to the focal lengths below instead.
APS-C sensor (the focal length inside the 
parentheses is the full frame-equivalent):
Approx. 22mm (35mm), 31mm (50mm), 44mm 
(70mm)
One way to implement this restriction is to use 
tape to fix the ring at the 50mm position. Use tape 
that leaves as little residue as possible. I recommend 
using permacel tape, which any photographer should 
have. This is a paper tape with minimal adhesive 
residue and good adhesion. If you don’t have 
permacel tape handy, you can also use surgical tape 
(the paper type), masking tape, and the like.
Limit yourself to telephoto or super wide-
angle if you’re using a prime lens
For those of you who think that the above 
example irrelevant because you already normally 
shoot with a prime lens, how about imposing 
limitations on telephoto (or super wide-angle) the 
next time you go out to take street photos?
The typical focal lengths used for street 
photography are in the range of 35mm, 50mm, and 
While it might be sufficient to promise yourself not to use the zoom, if possible, try affixing tape to the 
zoom ring to fix it in position. If you shoot with the determination not to remove the tape for the entire 
day, you just might discover something new.

the road and other buildings as well.
70mm mentioned above. Some photographers also use focal lengths of 24mm 
and 100mm. However, if you are daring enough to try street photography with 
a lens that shoots more telephoto or wide-angle, it could get really interesting.
You will need a telephoto lens or super wide-angle lens for this. How many 
of you out there admit that the telephoto lens in your double zoom kit has been 
lying unused all this while? 
It is amusing that when you limit yourself to shooting at a focal length of, 
say, 200mm or 16mm (35mm film-equivalent), it is so restrictive that you come 
up with various ideas while shooting. 
Intermediate: Get a sense of angles without the 
viewfinder
Earlier we limited the focal length – this time, let’s limit the use of the viewfinder. 
You can limit the focal length at the same time if you wish.
Normally you would look in the viewfinder and consider things such as 
whether to move a little closer or a bit to the right when composing your shots. 
However, are you roughly able to imagine what sort of range you can capture 
with the lens you have attached, without looking through the viewfinder?
I am not totally confident of this either, but if you have a good sense of 
angles, you will be able to compose your shots simply with the glance of an eye. 
Moreover, without the viewfinder it is easier to shoot from a different point 
of view from what you’re used to. For example, you can often take photos of 
a different flavour when shooting from ground level. It is hard to look through 
the viewfinder when shooting from ground level (look at the rear LCD screen 
instead), but easy to shoot without using the viewfinder. This means you can 
also take shots simply by placing the camera on a grassy patch.
I took the shot by stretching my arms out just above the surface of the 
water in a pond, where I wasn’t able to use the viewfinder
Here I placed my camera facing upwards inside a thicket, and was able to 
capture a somewhat mysterious atmosphere.
Recently, more and more cameras come equipped with a vari-angle LCD 
screen, but if you practice shooting without the viewfinder, you will develop 
a sense of angles, while at the same time learning how to shoot from various 
angles, so you should be able to take photos that are different from the ones 
you had been taking until now.
I recommend practicing with a wide-angle focal length. You could start 
with a focal length of approximately 35mm at 35mm film-equivalent. The 
more telephoto you go, the more difficult it gets.
Also, because the shutter may not be released if the camera is out of focus, 
set the AF mode to Automatic or All-point Selection (the camera automatically

determines the focus when you half-
press the shutter button), or boldly 
select Manual Focus (MF).
 
Advanced: Learn 
exposure by covering 
the LCD screen
This might have been the norm 
in the film camera era, but now that 
digital cameras have conquered the 
market, there would be very few 
people who could shoot with this 
restriction (I’m not confident that I 
Try shooting with 
manual exposure
Not being able to check photos 
on the spot means that you have 
to depend on the exposure meter 
inside the camera to determine 
the exposure. When shooting 
in Av mode, you need to think 
carefully about how much exposure 
compensation to apply, depending 
on the subject. That is why it might 
be somewhat easier to shoot in 
Manual (M) mode.
When you are shooting in 
could either).
In the film camera era, you 
weren’t able to check the result of 
your shoot until after the photos 
were developed. It was certainly 
necessary to put serious effort into 
reading the light for each and every 
shot, but with digital cameras that is 
no longer necessary.
Also, the biggest advantage of 
digital cameras is being able to 
check the result on the spot after 
each shot. By restricting the use 
of this function, you will be able to 
appreciate how blessed we are to 
be able to use digital cameras in this 
day and age.
The 
minimum 
necessary 
information for your shoot is displayed 
in the viewfinder, and on mid to high-
end models, you will be able to check 
the information on the LCD panel on 
the top of the camera. Therefore, you 
can still take shots even with the rear 
LCD monitor covered (unless you use 
a mirrorless camera).
The quickest way to do this is by 
covering the LCD monitor with black 
drawing paper. You could also use 
black permacel tape to cover the 
monitor (If you’re using a protective 
film on the LCD monitor, be careful 
not to peel off the film when 
removing the tape).
If you are simply not going to 
view the photo after each shot, 
depending on your camera, you can 
specify a mode that does not display 
the photo after you take a shot. For 
example, on the EOS 70D, this mode 
is available near the start of the 
menu.
M mode, I recommend using 
Spot Metering rather than the 
more popularly used Evaluative 
Metering (multi-pattern metering). 
By specifying spot metering, only 
the centre section on the screen is 
metered.
By pointing the camera toward 
the subject that you want to adjust 
the brightness for, then adjusting 
the aperture, shutter speed and ISO 
speed so that the exposure meter 
(vertical bar) inside the viewfinder 
becomes close to ±0, and releasing 
the shutter, you shouldn’t go far 
wrong with the brightness.
While you could also buy a 
separate exposure meter to read 
the light for practice, it is a rather 
expensive piece of equipment. If 
you only need to measure ambient 
light, there are smartphone apps 
available you might like to try that 
could turn your phone into a light 
meter.
 
Summary
Imposing all three of the restrictions 
I introduced in this article at once 
might be a bit overboard, so you 
might like to try them one at a time 
in sequence, starting from the top. 
If you can successfully shoots with 
each restriction, then you probably 
won’t have to worry about falling 
into a rut again.
Obviously there is no need 
to 
continuously 
impose 
such 
restrictions on yourself. The key 
is to try this when you have some 
spare time and are not feeling 
rushed, otherwise you might well 
end up in a deeper rut.
So how about giving this a go on 
your next holiday?

IDC Malaysia: Economic Pressure 
Forces Shift in Malaysian Economy  
2017 ICT predictions shows enterprise changing their 
business strategy in line with Digital Transformation
DC 
reveals 
their 
annual 
prediction for 2017, highlighting 
market changes and impacts 
from emerging technologies that 
is set to drive the future of the 
Malaysian ICT industry in the coming 
three years. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
digital 
transformation (DX) will gain traction 
in a macroeconomic scale over the 
next three to four years, leading to 
DX economy. IDC commented that 
Malaysian organisations face the 
need to transform amidst increasing 
economic pressures from the year 
before. 
DX requires the integration of 
many processes and adoption of 
new technologies, including big 
data analytics, changes in workflow 
deployment, 
cybersecurity 
and 
various 
strategic 
changes. 
IDC 
analyses and highlights each segment 
within the report.  
Looking at figures, big data 
continues to be vital; new cloud 
pricing models will be emerging 
for specific workloads, fuelling the 
growth of cloud analytics solutions. 
IDC expects to see three times as

much growth for cloud solutions over 
its on-premise counterparts by 2018.
Devices will also play an essential 
part of the workplace. With the 
increasing popularity and adoption of 
BYOD programs for many businesses 
- choose-your-own-device (CYOD) 
program could be the next step for 
enterprise to embrace mobility. 
It is predicted that by 2019, 30% 
unregulated enterprise organisations 
will be adopting this deployment 
model as their default device policy 
for eligible employees. 
On the topic of mobility and 
devices, IDC also highlighted four 
key Internet of Things (IoT) use cases 
in Malaysia - connected vehicles, 
insurance 
telematics, 
personal 
wellness, and smart buildings. This 
is expected to account for US$700 
million in spending within the country. 
Cybersecurity is an important 
concern for many businesses and 
recent threats have been increasing 
in not only scale but also complexity. 
It’s speculated that by 2018, 30% 
of 
cybersecurity 
environments 
will incorporate cognitive or AI 
technologies to aid humans in 
the detection and mitigation of 
cyberthreats.
The rate of data generation in 
a connected world will see more 
datacentres being deployed, calling 
for better planning and management. 
Companies 
in 
data-intensive 
industries will need to implement 
formal datacenter planning, sourcing, 
and 
governance 
processes 
to 
speed up DX efforts; adoption rate 
forecasted to be a quarter of the 
industry by 2018.
Anything-as-a-Service 
(XaaS) 
has 
rendered 
many 
traditional 
implementations 
redundant 
and 
competition has been increasing in 
the services space. The country will 
see 60% of enterprises reconsidering 
current service providers by 2020; 
shifting the function of systems 
integrators from traditional to digital. 
New service roles will be emerging 
for the increasing demand in digital 
services, as oppose to a more 
infrastructure focused approach.  
Malaysia being an active hub for 
Fintech startups, innovation might 
be slower than anticipated in 2017. 
For Malaysian banks, pressures on 
profitability increases, as investor 
confidence decline – brought on by 
the political risk, and the weakening 
Malaysian Ringgit. Any initiative for 
innovation will be hindered by cost 
optimisation considerations.
In terms of adoption rate for 
systems or services, Malaysia is 
still lagging slightly. However, with 
economic pressures mounting, it is 
inevitable that enterprises will face 
the need to transform their business 
strategy, creating a shift the economy 
in the next few years.

FORTINET’S JONATHAN NRUYEN-DUY TALKS ABOUT HOW IOT CAN BE A DUAL-EDGE 
SWORD FOR ENTERPRISES 
IOT – A DANGER OR 
BOON FOR THE CLOUD?
By Sharil

JAN 2017
SPOTLIGHT
W
e have been listening to companies announcing new products based on Internet of Things (IoT). From connected to lights all the way to 
fridges – IoT products are becoming more and more prevalent in everyday life. However there is a danger to having devices connected 
to the internet – it can be a new way for unwanted parties to connect into your network. This is more important if the IoT users are 
based in companies or enterprises. What dangers lurk for companies who uses IoT and the cloud together? We talk to Jonathan 
Nguyen-Duy, Fortinet’s Global VP for Strategic Programs to get Fortinet’s view on this matter.

101
MARCH 2017
PC.com: Cloud is intricately tied to IoT due to 
the nature the technology involved. Are IoT 
companies taking serious steps in securing 
their data?
Johnathan: Traditional security solutions are 
no longer adequate in protecting today’s agile 
and highly distributed cloud environments and 
expanding attack surfaces. For many organizations, 
their cloud-based infrastructure and services have 
become a blind spot in their security strategy. And 
cybercriminals are prepared to take advantage of 
this.
Since IoT devices are being deployed 
everywhere, securing them requires visibility and 
control across highly distributed ecosystems. This 
requires organizations to tie together what is 
happening across IT, OT (Operations Technology), 
and IoT networks, on remote devices, and across 
their public and private cloud networks. Integrating 
distinct security tools into a coherent system 
enables organizations to collect and correlate 
threat intelligence in real time, identify abnormal 
behavior, and automatically orchestrate a response 
anywhere along an attack path.
PC.com: What do you see IoT will do to 
the security of the Internet, especially in 
Malaysia?
Johnathan: The IoT revolution is poised to bring 
new challenges to network security. Connectivity is 
no longer limited to high-end technology consumers 
(watches and drones), but nearly everything - from 
children’s toys to kitchen appliances and media 
devices. Purchasers of these new technology-
enabled products are far from security experts 
or even security aware. Instead, their primary 
purchasing requirement is ease of use.
Over a million new IoT devices are being 
connected to the internet daily. Experts predict that 
as many as 25 to 50 billon IoT devices and sensors 
will be deployed by 2020, for an average of 4.3 
internet-connected devices for every man, woman 
and child on the planet.
For local enterprises, this means the security 
risks related to this new era of technology 
personalization are both significant and unplanned. 
With the advent of IoT, employees will simply 
sync their personal smart devices, connect to the 
corporate WiFi network and even remotely connect 
to the cloud-based services deployed across the 
corporate network.  IoT adoption represents an 
expansion of the attack surface as more users, 
systems and networks are interconnected.   For 
already overstretched security teams, it means 
a larger monitoring challenge and the need to 
understand whether newly connected IoT devices 
are secure.
PC.com: As more companies, business 
and even individuals adopt more IoT in 
their working environment, what are the 
fundamental requirements that they need to 
have for a robust security policy in dealing 
with IoT devices?
Johnathan:  One solution is to buy IoT-focused 
security. Security vendors have begun promoting 
authentication, key and credential management, 
access, posture assessment and monitors, trackers 
and orchestration tools to help organizations see 
and secure their IoT.
Like the networks being protected, security 
needs to be redesigned. It needs broad visibility 
to see what is happening across IT, OT and IoT 
networks, remote and mobile devices, and public 
and private cloud networks. And this needs to 
happen through a single console, in real time, so 
devices can be identified, risk levels assessed, 
traffic segmented and policies assigned.
IoT has to be viewed in the context of an 
organization’s total digital transformation and risk 
management strategy. As IoT devices and data are 
woven into a hyper-connected network, isolating 
one’s IoT security strategy will increase security 
overhead and complexity, and reduce visibility and 
control.
And 
more 
importantly, 
a 
holistic 
risk 
management approach integrates with larger IT 
and OT infrastructures to provide complete visibility 
and unprecedented span of control, allowing you to 
develop and deploy a critical, hyper-connected IoT 
infrastructure without compromising the security or 
integrity of your extended network.
PC.com: How can enterprises and organization 
work with third parties in ensuring their IoT 
infrastructure will be secure?
Johnathan:  Vendors today are implementing 
thousands of unique combinations of software, 
and implementing dozens of technologies (WiFi, 
Bluetooth, NFC, zigbee, RFID) on billions of new 
devices. Unfortunately, the traditional approach of 
bolting security onto inherently unsecure devices 
is no longer possible as IoT devices are headless. 
Instead, enterprise security professionals need to 
adopt a vastly different security strategy.
A 
distributed 
and 
integrated 
security 
architecture needs to cover your entire networked 
ecosystem, expand and ensure resilience, secure 
compute resources and workloads, and provide 
routing and WAN optimization
PC.com: Will IoT be a boon or a bane for 
organizations in the long run?
Johnathan: IoT will make the world more hyper-
connected than ever and this is both a boon and a bane.
IoT can be divided into three broad categories. 
The first, Consumer IoT, which includes the 
connected devices we are most familiar with, 
such as smart phones, watches, and connected 
appliances and entertainment systems. The other 
two, Commercial IoT and Industrial IoT, are made 
up of things many of us never see. Commercial 
IoT includes things like inventory controls, device 
trackers, and connected medical devices, while 
Industrial IoT covers such things as connected 
electric meters, water flow gauges, pipeline 
monitors, manufacturing robots, and other types of 
connected industrial controls.
The emergence of IoT is pushing security 
from being a network afterthought and bolt-on 
technology to an integral, persistent, omnipresent 
part of the network. The old approach of installing 
an MDM client on smartphones and tablets, 
which some of us still do today, is not an option 
for IoT devices. Secured, trustworthy networking 
is preferred over networking plus security.  To limit 
the scope and exposure of an exploited device, we 
need to create even smaller security domains.

criminals now act as part of syndicates 
that span the globe and use their 
deep pockets to fund in-depth attacks 
as well as the development of new 
malicious programs.
Let’s take a closer look at 
what cyber threats could impact 
your business and how to protect 
yourself against them.
1. Ransomware
However, as The Atlantic noted, 
this number only accounts for 
the victims that reported their 
incidents to the bureau. The true 
extent of ransomware and price 
of lost productivity could be much 
more severe. experts predict that 
the rate of ransomware incidents 
will continue to rise this year, and 
organizations, particularly those 
handling financial data, personal 
information 
and 
healthcare 
records, must protect themselves.
within the first three months 
of 2016, ransomware cost victims 
a total of $209 million.
For 
example, 
healthcare 
providers are major targets for 
ransomware 
attacks. 
Patient 
records are particularly valuable 
for identity theft and medical 
fraud. As Modern Healthcare 
contributor Joseph Conn noted, 
the push toward electronic health 
records has introduced a significant 
vulnerability, providing additional 
entry 
points 
through 
mobile 
devices. To make matters worse, 
when data is being ransomed, 
many organizations decide to pay 
it in order to recover quickly. The 
problem is, attackers might not 
always release your information 
once the ransom is paid – they may 
instead ask for more money.
no matter what industry you’re 
in, ransomware is a popular way 
for attackers to halt productivity 
and make money from your loss. 
You should never pay the ransom, 
as there’s no guarantee that the 
hackers or cyber-crime syndicates 
will live up to their promises. 
instead, start setting up securely 
contained, off-site data backup 
and recovery systems, which can 
be the saving grace to restore 
your critical files. Furthermore, 
leverage data breach systems 
to detect unusual activity and 
identify hackers when they’re 
active in your network before they 
plant malicious software.
“Any signs of phishing will not 
be overly obvious.” (quote out)
2. Phishing and whaling
Phishing tactics have also become 
more sophisticated over the years 
to convince more unsuspecting 
viewers to click on malicious links

or files. in the first quarter of 
2016, the Anti-Phishing working 
Group identified more phishing 
attacks than in any other three-
month span since it began 
tracking data 13 years ago. More 
than 120,000 unique phishing 
websites were found in March of 
that year alone. Attackers send 
these malicious links through 
emails using common subject 
lines 
and 
legitimate-looking 
addresses. if organizations don’t 
have capable security tools, they 
can easily miss these harmful 
links and permit an attacker to 
enter their system.
The other side of the phishing 
spectrum is the more aggressive 
whaling method. This form 
of phishing features emails 
that are targeted at getting 
information out of executives 
and business leaders. whaling 
emails look like they are coming 
from a normal address of someone 
with legitimate authority that 
needs help resolving an urgent 
issue, Lifewire stated. Hackers 
can use this approach to gain 
employee 
information, 
critical 
documents and even access to 
critical systems.
it’s 
important 
to 
train 
employees how to avoid phishing 
and whaling schemes and what 
malicious emails can look like. The 
signs will not be overly obvious, 
and this is why so many continue 
to fall for these methods. while 
data breach systems will identify 
viruses and other malicious traffic 
within your network, it will be up 
to you to ensure that you don’t 
reveal personal information to 
malicious parties.

be true, it probably is a phishing 
attempt.if a deal looks too good

3. Scams
if something seems like it’s too 
good to be true, it probably is. 
Many scammers will use pop-
up windows, deals and prizes 
to get you to click and install 
malware. The trip to Hawaii 
that you magically won without 
entering a contest is probably 
not 
legitimate. 
However, 
attackers will use sophisticated 
techniques to make these types 
of communications look like the 
real deal. it’s important for users 
to be skeptical of offers and 
check with real companies to see 
if they’re authentic.

scheme to steal user credentials 
and infect their systems with 
Trojans to take financial and 
personal data. Attackers posted 
ads on suspicious sites offering 
a netflix account for free, which 
led users to a login generator – 
essentially a tool that should 
automatically generate legitimate 
login credentials. victims who 
agreed to the deal were quickly 
greeted by ransomware on their 
computers. if you download this

Ok that is a bit lame I have to agree, but the fact that we are looking 
at a game that pits three totally different factions against each other is 
awesome, despite that the three factions are not natively near each other 
at the point of time the game is set in. Sometimes a brawn-centric game 
is just what the doctor ordered, and For Honor is definitely a game that

e A Commander 
Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, For Honor 
is a multiplayer game that gives the player 
the control over a commander of an army 
going against a hoard of human enemies. It uses a 
third-person perspective, so you are always behind 
the shoulder of your character as it melees through the 
swarm of enemies that threatens to overcome you in 
battle. 
You get to choose from three factions – Knights, 
Samurais and Vikings. With each faction, you get a 
different playing style and weaponary. For example, 
Knights will always favour long swords while Vikings 
will have their trusty axe by their side. Samurais 
meanwhile will be using a long katana as their main 
weapon. Within each faction there are four classes, 
with the Vanguard leading the way, the Assassin 
focusing on duels with the enemies, the Heavies being 
the tank of the game and the Hybrid being the jack of 
all trades. 
For Honor lives and dies on its fighting system, 
dubbed “The Art of Battle” by Ubisoft. This battle 
system makes the game look and feel more like Street 
Fighter than Medieval Knights hack and slash games. 
The mechanics is quite straight forward – you either 
battle the hoard on ground, or enter into a duel with 
an enemy commander. While you are in a duel, you get 
more fine-tuned battle mechanics, as you can block, 
guard and power attack your enemy when compared to 
the standard hack and slash when you are faced with 
the normal crowd of enemy. 
Not Too Simple 
Don’t be fooled by the deceptively simple mechanics. 
Timing is everything in this game. When I played the 
first couple of mission, I had to balance between 
guarding and attacking, as the penalty of doing the 
wrong thing at the wrong time is severe injury, or 
even death. What I do like about the mechanic is that 
the environment can come into play. For example, if 
you want to replicate the scene from 300 by kicking 
the enemy down below – go ahead. Want to smash 
enemies into breakable pots – do it. You can even use 
mounted weapons when you come across them on the 
ground. 
One comment about the fighting system is that it 
is slow. It is more of a slow ballet than a fast-hip-hop 
dance. You will need to figure out your opponents, 
and then proceed with the guard-guard-attack 
methodology to win the round. 
Multiplayer on For Honor is a long and tedious 
process. You need to scavenge items to upgrade 
yourself, but scarcity is the game in, well, the game. 
Good items will take up more of the in-game currency, 
Steel, but really good items will cost more steel than 
you can collect in a single sitting. Multiple returns to 
mission may be needed to truly collect all of the Steel 
that you need to get that sweet, sweet armour. 
After you get your armour, you can head on to the

Dominion and Skirmish modes. The last mode is where 
two teams battle it out over control points or just head 
straight one to kill the other player in brutal combat. 
Revenge is a dish best served cold, and the Revenge 
Mode is one of the cooler aspects of the game. It is a 
meter that slowly fills when you’re on the defensive 
- that, when activated, grants you a temporary attack 
and defence buff along with a shield to soak up the 
damage. It’s a great tool to help turn the tide, and it 
regularly swings a fight in your favour.

that is Multiplayer. It is divided across three chapters, 
representing the three factions. In each chapter 
features six episodes to flesh out the storyline of the 
factions that you are playing. 
The chapters acts as a great primer for me to test 
out all of the heroes – acting as chapter-long trial 
runs for you to test out who will be the best match 
to your playing style. The chapters themselves do not 
weather well for returning game however, as it can 
feel repetitive quickly enough that you feel that it is 
becoming a chore rather than something to enjoy. 
Final Thoughts
If you are looking for something unique in the 
landscape of gaming, For Honor certainly fits the bill.

f you’ve ever played the Dark Souls series, 
Bloodbourne or even Nioh, Ninja Arashi is a 
game for you then.
The story of Ninja Arashi follows a 
vengeful ninja by the name of Arashi as he runs 
through various lands to find his kidnapped son. 
The only thing that boggles my mind right now is 
how does a ninja, who appears to be that good at 
dispatching his enemies with ease (or am I that 
good?), lose his son in the first place. My guess 
is that he probably wanted to let his son get 
kidnapped in the first place so that he could go on 
a murderous rampage without any repercussions 
(y’know with ninjas having to follow a code of 
conduct and all that).
Booby Traps Everywhere
The one thing that irritates me the most about 
Ninja Arashi is the amount of booby traps the 
game has laid out for you. From poison to spears 
impaling me left, right and centre, it’s a wonder 
why people really want Arashi dead. After dying 
for the umpteenth time (much like how I play Dark 
Souls and Nioh), you will be transported back to 
the last check point, where you will have to run 
through the same map over and over and over 
again until you get it right.
Ninja Arashi also follows similar gameplay 
mechanics as the three AAA titles mentioned 
earlier. From not only the booby traps, but also 
destroying inanimate objects in your path for gold 
and items. Staying out of the line of sight from your 
enemies is also a crucial element into the gameplay 
of Ninja Arashi as if there are too many charging 
towards you, you will be taken down and you will 
die, which in turn will send you back to the last 
check point.
Stupid Monkey Ninja
In Dota 2, Valve introduced its first original character 
known as Monkey King into the Dota 2 lore. Aside 
from being able to conjure up illusions of himself 
and leaping from tree to tree, Monkey King has a 
very interesting ability where he can transform 
himself into anything he chooses, depending on his 
surroundings. Arashi the ninja can do the exact same 
thing. Whereas Monkey King can transform into 
runes, trees and basic items (Ironwood branches, 
Healing Salves and Tangos), Arashi can transform 
into pots and boxes to camouflage himself from his 
enemies.
If you want to have some fun with the enemies, 
try camouflaging yourself and ever-so slightly move 
him closer towards them before slicing their guts 
open. Sadly, there is no animation of guts spilling 
out but that is where your imagination takes over.
Cop or Drop
As side-scrolling action/adventure mobile games 
go, Ninja Arashi is a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. 
Although the story and gameplay in itself is pretty 
interesting, I have no patience for games where I 
just can’t charge in headfirst without thinking of 
the consequences. Such are the games of today’s 
generation where strategy is everything; I grew up in 
simpler times where you can slice your way through 
anything without a scratch. A perk of Ninja Arashi is 
that it’s totally free but you will have to endure the 
constant ads that pop-up from time to time.

PLAYING 
KNIGHT 
AND DAY
 Post Knight 
’m actually not a fan of mobile games. Why would I want to 
waste my time, battery and data on a game when I already 
have a console and a gaming laptop? Besides, those three 
aspects could be better spent on women who will openly and 
outright reject me without a moment’s notice. Why should I waste 
all that on a mobile game when I can train my ego into accepting a 
woman’s rejection and not feel like imploding from within?
I digress. Postknight is pretty fun after the first five minutes of 
me mindlessly bashing the game before actually giving it a chance. 
In my defence, the first five minutes of the game was undeniably 
horrible where I had to come up with my own character name. Every 
gamer would know that is difficult, right behind having to choose 
which class of character you are and the kind of starting outfit said 
character will have.

Errand Boy on The Loose
The purpose of Postknight is in 
the name itself; you’re essentially 
an errand boy running through 
different towns to deliver letters 
and the occasional odd job passing 
the 
townspeople 
their 
items. 
In return, you get experience 
points (EXP), gold and other items 
which will go into upgrading your 
weapons, armour and potions. 
Now, it may seem like a very simple 
and mundane task but the kick is in 
the side-scrolling part of the game 
(trust me, even I underestimated 
the game and died three times in 
a row).
However, I must commend 
how the local gaming community 
has grown as Postknight was 
done by Kurechii, a local gaming 
production studio who were also 
responsible for Tiny Guardians. As 
much as I hate to admit it, I found 
myself slowly getting addicted 
to Postknight and completing the 
many side quests it had to offer. 
There is also a way to speed up 
the growth process of your knight 
by purchasing gold coins and gems 
for real money but where’s the fun 
in a ‘pay to play’ method? This isn’t 
League of Legends (yes, I said it).
Going Postal 
It’s safe to say that I do have anger 
issues (my desk at home as well 
as my ex-girlfriends can attest to 
that); with that said, Postknight 
did bring out the toxic gamer in me 
and believe me when I tell you, it’s 
not pretty. You’re only given three 
active skills to use during the fights 
and have no way of dodging attacks 
against you; your best bet would be 
to hope your character can dodge 
all of the attacks, which never 
happens. You’re given one offensive 
ability, one defensive and a potion, 
all of which has a cooldown timer.
As you progress through the 
game, your abilities will get 
better with a shorter cooldown 
time but in the early stages, it is 
easy to be a little bit too gung-ho 
and charge head-on into the fight 
without coming up with some 
sort of strategy to take on your 
opponents. I should really learn to 
think before I act (both in-game and 
in real life). As much as each stage 
does increase my blood pressure, it 
does have a reward that makes it 
all go away as I can proudly throw 
my phone down onto the table, flip 
it off, beat my chest in victory and 
then go to have mediocre sex with 
my girlfriend (in that exact order 
but I lied about the sex part; I don’t 
have a girlfriend).
No Damsel in Distress to 
Save
Aside from saving the usual 
damsel in distress from a tower 
guarded by a fearsome dragon that 
can breathe fire at will, your only 
solace of companionship is with a 
random girl in each different town, 
which you will have to charm 
at first by giving them gifts in 
the shape of food. In that sense, 
Kurechii has got that completely 
right as the quickest way to a 
girl’s heart is through her stomach 
(although its more suited for 
guys, I’d like to think that the way 
through my stomach isn’t actually 
food but alcohol).
Is It Worth Being A Knight?
After spending over an hour 
grinding my character from level 
one to level 20, I can safely say that 
Postknight is an addictive game and 
I am waiting for the clock to strike 
at six so I can head on home to 
continue my game (if it isn’t clear 
by now, I lead a very sad and lonely 
life; save me please). If you’re into 
being mildly addicted to a mobile 
game that you just wouldn’t be 
able to tear your eyes away from, 
Postknight is a game for you.

for about two weeks, users over

various forums on the Internet about 
a recurring connectivity problem 
with the left Joy-Con controller,

However, this only happens

to get both controllers working. 
The main point is to not place the

to keep the Switch at a minimum of 
three or four feet away from other 
wireless devices.

Once that is done, you will

chances of our local teams as the 
top two teams who qualified for 
the SEA region were Team Faceless 
from Singapore and TNC from the 
Philippines. Sadly, teams like Fnatic 
and Mineski-x didn’t make it past 
the Open Qualifiers and were sent 
packing early in the qualifiers. 
China was another region which 
was given two slots in the qualifiers, 
which went to iG Vitality and Invictus 
Gaming. iG Vitality were the first 
team to qualify, sending its sister 
team Invictus Gaming to the lower 
bracket and having to play an extra 
best-of-three series against Vici 
Gaming. After suffering a heavy loss 
in the first game, Invictus Gaming 
bounced back to win the next two 
games against Vici Gaming.
However, the regions of CIS, 
Europe, North and South America only 
had one spot each for the qualifiers, 
making the competition much more 
difficult. Virtus Pro had a slightly 
better time than most of the other 
qualifiers, making a clean 2-0 sweep 
of once former greats, NaVi who 
are still struggling to find their form 
although they did perform admirably 
to reach the CIS qualifier finals. 
Team Secret also had a comfortable 
2-0 win over Alliance in the Europe 
qualifier finals, which featured former 
Fnatic mid player, MidOne outplaying 
Alliance in both games.
The South American qualifier saw 
SG e-Sports pull an upset over Not 
Today with a 2-1 victory. The North 
American qualifier saw favourites 
Team NP get knocked out by eventual 
winners Team Onyx, who snatched a 
2-1 victory over team CompLexity. 

Hyperloop: a new frontier of transportati0n
The next generation of transportation is here. 
A brainchild of Elon Musk, Hyperloop is designed to be a more economical way to travel from point A to 
point B, by using faster than sound travel. 
Travellers sits in a pod that is set in a sealed tube, which is then propelled along the tube at high speeds. 
How high? How about 720KM/h – slightly faster than the cruising speed of a jetliner at 35,000 feet. 
This system will make ground travel faster, and according to the design, have more easier access as the 
tube interchange station can be built right in the middle of a city like a normal train station. 
Testing are underway, and we may see this be rolled out sometime within the next decade or so.
