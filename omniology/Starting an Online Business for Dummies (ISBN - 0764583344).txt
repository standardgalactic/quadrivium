About the Author
Greg Holden started a small business called Stylus Media, which is a group
of editorial, design, and computer professionals who produce both print and
electronic publications. The company gets its name from a recording stylus
that reads the traces left on a disk by voices or instruments and translates
those signals into electronic data that can be amplified and enjoyed by many.
He has been self-employed for the past ten years. He is an avid user of eBay,
both as a buyer and seller, and he recently started his own blog. 
One of the ways Greg enjoys communicating is through explaining technical
subjects in nontechnical language. The first edition of Starting an Online
Business For Dummies was the ninth of his more than thirty computer books.
He also authored eBay PowerUser’s Bible for Wiley Publishing. Over the years,
Greg has been a contributing editor of Computer Currents magazine, where he
writes a monthly column. He also contributes to PC World and the University
of Illinois at Chicago alumni magazine. Other projects have included preparing
documentation for an electronics catalog company in Chicago and creating
online courses on Windows 2000 and Microsoft Word 2000.
Greg balances his technical expertise and his entrepreneurial experience
with his love of literature. He received an M.A. in English from the University
of Illinois at Chicago and also writes general interest books, short stories,
and poetry. Among his editing assignments is the monthly newsletter for his
daughters’ grade school.
After graduating from college, Greg became a reporter for his hometown
newspaper. Working at the publications office at the University of Chicago was
his next job, and it was there that he started to use computers. He discov-
ered, as the technology became available, that he loved desktop publishing
(with the Macintosh and LaserWriter) and, later on, the World Wide Web.
Greg loves to travel, but since his two daughters were born, he hasn’t
been able to get around much. He was able to translate his experiences
into a book called Karma Kids: Answering Everyday Parenting Questions with
Buddhist Wisdom. However, through the Web, he enjoys traveling vicariously
and meeting people online. He lives with his family in an old house in Chicago
that he has been rehabbing for — well, for many years now. He is a collector
of objects such as pens, cameras, radios, and hats. He is always looking for
things to take apart so that he can see how they work and fix them up. Many
of the same skills prove useful in creating and maintaining Web pages. He is
an active member of Jewel Heart, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation and study
group based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Dedication
To my best friend Ann Lindner, who makes everything possible.

Author’s Acknowledgments
One of the things I like best about this book is that it’s a teaching tool that
gives me a chance to share my knowledge — small business owner to small
business owner — about computers, the Internet, and communicating your
message to others in an interactive way. As any businessperson knows, most
large-scale projects are a team effort.
While the online business landscape has changed since this book was first
published, some basic principles remain the same. One is the fact that the
most successful entrepreneurs also tend to be the ones who are the most
generous with their time and experience. They taught me that the more help-
ful you are, the more successful you’ll be in return.
I want to thank all those who were profiled as case studies, particularly John
Moen of Graphic Maps, who pops up all through the book. Special recognition
also goes to attorney David Adler (www.ecommerceattorney.com) for his
assistance with Chapter 16. Thanks also go to Jeremy G. Alicandri of Simply
Cheap.com; Ed Bryson of Yahoo! Small Business; Lucky Boyd of MyTexasMusic.
com; Mike Holden of lp2cdsolutions; Kristin Lindner of Elephant of Joy; John
Counsel of The Profit Clinic; Caroline Dauteuille, Jeffrey E. Edelheit, and Mike
Gearhart of CMStat Corporation; Lars Hundley of Clean Air Gardening; Kimberly
King; Mark Lauer of General Tool and Repair; Doug Laughter of The Silver
Connection; Brennan Mulligan of Timbuk2 Designs; John Raddatz of SoftBear
Shareware; Sarah-Lou Reekie of Alfresco; Michael Rosenberg of Health
Decisions; Judy Vorfeld of Office Support Services; and Marques Vickers.
I would also like to acknowledge some of my own colleagues who helped pre-
pare and review the text and graphics of this book and who have supported
and encouraged me in other lessons of life. Thanks to Ann Lindner, whose
teaching experience proved invaluable in suggesting ways to make the text
more clear, and to my assistant Ben Huizenga.
For editing and technical assignments, I was lucky to be in the capable hands
of the folks at Wiley Publishing: my project editor Nicole Sholly, my copy
editor Jean Rogers, and technical editor Jim Kelly.
Thanks also to Neil Salkind and David and Sherry Rogelberg of Studio B, and to
Terri Varveris of Wiley Publishing for helping me to add this book to the list
of those I’ve authored and, in the process, to broaden my expertise as a writer.
Last but certainly not least, the future is in the hands of the generation of my
two daughters, Zosia and Lucy, who allow me to learn from the curiosity and
joy with which they approach life.

Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Introduction
You’ve been thinking about starting your own business, but until now, it’s
been just a dream. After all, you’re a busy person. You have a full-time job,
whether it’s running your home or working outside your home. Or perhaps
you’ve been through some life-changing event and are ready to take off in a
new direction. Then the economy took a turn for the worse, and you were
understandably reluctant to make a big career change.
Well, I have news for you: Now is the perfect time to turn your dream into
reality by starting your own online business. Individuals just like you are
making money and enriching their lives by operating businesses online.
The clock and your location are no longer limiting factors. Small business
owners can now work any time of the night or day in their spare bedrooms,
local libraries, or neighborhood coffee shops. And there are new ways of
making money online, such as starting a blog or starting a full-time business
on eBay, which are becoming more viable all the time. 
If you like the idea of being in business for yourself, but you don’t have a partic-
ular product or service in mind at the moment, relax and keep yourself open
for inspiration. Many different kinds of commercial enterprises can hit it big
on the Internet. Among the entrepreneurs I interviewed for this book are a
woman who sells her own insect repellent, a mapmaker, a woman who provides
office services for the medical community, a housewife who sells sweetener
and coffee on eBay, a sculptor and painter, a young man who started selling
electronics online at age 16, and several folks who create Web pages for other
businesses. With the help of this book, you can start a new endeavor and be
in charge of your own cyberbusiness, too.
You Can Do It!
What’s that? You say you wouldn’t know a merchant account, profit-and-loss
statement, or clickthrough advertising rate if it came up to you on the street
and introduced itself? Don’t worry: The Internet (and this book) level the
playing field, so a novice has just as good a chance at succeeding as MBAs
who love to throw around business terms at cocktail parties.
The Internet is pretty much an accepted part of the business landscape these
days. Whether you’ve been in business for 20 years or 20 minutes, the keys to
success are the same:

 Having a good idea: If you have something to sell that people have an
appetite for, and if your competition is slim, your chances of success are
hefty.
 Working hard: When you are your own boss, you can make yourself
work harder than any of your former bosses ever could. But if you put in
the effort and persist through the inevitable ups and downs, you will be
a winner.
 Preparing for success: One of the most surprising and useful things I
discovered from the online businesspeople that I interviewed was that if
you believe that you will succeed, you probably will. Believe in yourself
and proceed as though you’re going to be successful. Together with your
good ideas and hard work, your confidence will pay off.
If you’re the cautious type who wants to test the waters before you launch
your new business on the Internet, let this book lead you gently up the learn-
ing curve. After you’re online, you can master techniques to improve your
presence. This book includes helpful hints for doing market research and
reworking your Web site until you get the success you want. Even if you
aren’t among the lucky small business owners who make a fortune by con-
necting to the Net, the odds are very good that you will make new friends,
build your confidence, and have fun, too.
The Water’s Still Fine
When I first started revising this new edition in the fall of 2004, I was excited
to find that new business opportunities were springing up again after some
lean years. eBay is booming. Other well-known Web-based service providers
like Yahoo!, PayPal, and Amazon.com are enabling entrepreneurs to start up
new businesses. Bloggers are taking the Internet by storm, and some are
making a regular source of income from their online diaries. Google and
Overture are making it easier than ever to gain advertising revenue. 
As the Web becomes more of a way of life and broadband Internet connections
become widespread, doing business online becomes more of a real possibility.
Still, you may have reasonable concerns about the future of e-commerce for
the very entrepreneurs this book seeks to help — individuals who are starting
their first businesses on the Web. Your fears will quickly evaporate when you
read this book’s case studies of my friends and colleagues who do business
online. They’re either thriving or at least treading water, and they enthusiasti-
cally encourage others to jump right in — the water’s fine.
This is still a great time to start an online business. People who are getting into
e-commerce today have advantages over those who started out three or four
years ago. Simply put, both consumers and businesses are smarter. “There
are more experts in the field so that it is easier to make things happen,” says
Sarah-Lou Reekie, an online entrepreneur I profile in Chapter 13. “The world
2
Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 4th Edition 

is far more au fait and switched on to the Web. The percentage of people able
to competently order is far higher. People aren’t as nervous as they were to
put through credit cards. After an amazingly short time, the Web has changed
from an unknown and somewhat scary medium to something as easy as ABC
for most users.”
“I feel the best time to start an online business is when you are positioned to
begin. I do not feel that there is an advantage/disadvantage to waiting for a
‘better time’ to start,” says Mark Cramer, whose own online business and
Web site are profiled in Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site (located at
www.dummies.com/go/onlinebusinessfd).
Where This Book Is Coming From
Online business isn’t just for large corporations, or even just for small busi-
nesses that already have a storefront in the real world and simply want to
supplement their marketability with a Web site.
The Internet is a perfect venue for individuals who want to start their own
business, who like using computers, and who believe that cyberspace is the
place to do it. You don’t need much money to get started, after all. If you
already have a computer and an Internet connection and can create your
own Web pages (which this book will help you with), making the move to
your own business Web site may cost only $100 or less. After you’re online,
the overhead is pretty reasonable, too: You may pay only $10 to $75 per
month to a Web hosting service to keep your site online.
With each month that goes by, the number of Internet users increases exponen-
tially. To be precise, in early 2004 Neilsen//NetRatings released data indicating
that more than 74 percent of the U.S. population had access to the Internet at
home. The Pew Internet & American Life Project reported that 39 percent of
adults who surf the Internet do so with a broadband connection. We have now
reached that critical mass where most people are using the Internet regularly
for everyday shopping and other financial activities. The Internet is already
becoming a powerhouse for small businesses.
So why wait to fall behind your competition? The goal of this book is to help
you open your fledgling business on the Internet now. Let this book guide you
through the following steps:
 Preparing a business plan, defining your target market, and setting goals
 Purchasing the hardware and software you need to run your business
 Making your Web pages content rich and interactive
 Reaching your customers through multiple marketplaces such as eBay,
Yahoo!, Amazon.com, and your own Web site

Introduction

 Marketing to customers around the world
 Creating a secure environment for shopping and receiving payments online
 Keeping your business records and observing legal requirements
How to Use This Book
Want to get an overview of the whole process of going online and be inspired
by one man’s online business success story? Zip ahead to Chapter 1. Want to
find out how to accept credit card payments? Flip ahead to Chapter 12. Feel
free to skip back and forth to chapters that interest you. I’ve made this book
into an easy-to-use reference tool that you will be comfortable with, no matter
what your level of experience with computers and networking. You don’t have
to scour each chapter methodically from beginning to end to find what you
want. The Net doesn’t work that way and neither does this book!
If you’re just starting out and need to do some essential business planning, see
Chapter 2. If you want to prepare a shopping list of business equipment, see
Chapter 3. Chapters 4 through 10 are all about the essential aspects of creating
and operating a successful online business, from organizing and marketing
your Web site to providing effective online customer service and security.
Later chapters get into advertising, legal issues, and accounting. The fun
thing about being online is that continually improving and redoing your pre-
sentation is easy. So start where it suits you and come back later for more.
What This Book Assumes
This book assumes that you have never been in business before but that
you’re interested in setting up your own commercial site on the Internet. I
also assume that you’re familiar with the Internet, have been surfing for a
while, and may even have put out some information of your own in the form
of a home page.
It also assumes that you have or are ready to get the following:
 A computer and a modem: Don’t worry, Chapter 2 explains exactly what
hardware and software you need.
 Instructions on how to think like a businessperson: I spend a good
amount of time in this book encouraging you to set goals, devise strate-
gies to meet those goals, and do the sort of planning that successful
businesspeople need to do.
4
Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 4th Edition 

 Just enough technical know-how: You don’t have to do it all yourself.
Plenty of entrepreneurs decide to partner with someone or hire an
expert to perform design and technical work. This book can help you
understand your options and give you a basic vocabulary so that you
can work productively with the consultants you hire.
What’s Where in This Book
This book is divided into six parts. Each part contains chapters that discuss
stages in the process of starting an online business. There’s also an Internet
Directory that you can access through this book’s Web site; it presents an 
up-to-date list of resources that are essential for any online businessperson.
Part I: Strategies and Tools 
for Your Online Business
In Part I, I describe what you need to do and how you need to think in order to
start your new online business. The first chapter follows the story about how
a business started by a graphic artist-turned mapmaker has grown into an
Internet success story. Subsequent chapters also present case studies profiling
other entrepreneurs and describing how they started their online businesses.
Within these pages is where I also describe the software that you need in
order to create Web pages and perform essential business tasks, along with
any computer upgrades that will help your business run more smoothly. You
also discover how to choose a Web host and find exciting new ways to make
money online.
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence
Even if you use an online service that isn’t technically part of the Web, such as
America Online, you need to create a Web site — a series of interconnected
Web pages that everyone in cyberspace can view with a Web browser. As far
as online business is concerned, the Web is where it’s at. This part explains
how to create a compelling and irresistible Web site, one that attracts paying
customers around the world and keeps them coming back to make more pur-
chases. This part also includes options for attracting and keeping customers,
making your site secure, and updating and improving your online business.
5
Introduction

Part III: Successful Online Business Models
Some of the most exciting new aspects of starting a business online are ways
to generate sales revenue that don’t involve setting up your own Web site
from scratch. Instead of going it alone, you sign up with one of the many well-
established business marketplaces on the Web that enables individuals just
like you to create storefronts or sell individual items. You find out about cre-
ating storefronts on Amazon.com, Yahoo!, PayPal, and CafePress.com, among
other venues. You also discover the ins and outs of starting a business on eBay,
a marketplace that has changed lives and is quickly changing the landscape
of online business. 
Part IV: Running and Promoting 
Your Online Business
Your work doesn’t end after you put your Web site online or start to make a
few sales. In fact, what you do after you open your cyberdoors for business
can make the difference between a site that says “Wow!” and one that says
“Ho-hum.” In this part, I describe cost-effective marketing and advertising
techniques that you can do yourself to increase visibility and improve cus-
tomer satisfaction. You discover how to make the shopping experience a
smooth one for your customers, how to accept payments, and how to pro-
vide good customer service. You also find out about new ways to increase
visibility with search services such as Google.
Part V: The Necessary Evils: 
Law and Accounting
This part delves into some less-than-sexy but essential activities for any online
business. Find out about general security methods designed to make commerce
more secure on the Internet. I also discuss copyrights, trademarks, and other
legal concerns for anyone wanting to start a company in the increasingly
competitive atmosphere of the Internet. Finally, you get an overview of basic
accounting practices for online businesses and suggestions of accounting tools
that you can use to keep track of your e-commerce activities.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Filled with tips, cautions, suggestions, and examples, the Part of Tens pre-
sents many tidbits of information that you can use to plan and create your
6
Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 4th Edition 

own business presence on the Internet, including ten hot new ways to make
money on the Web.
An Online Feature: The Starting an Online
Business For Dummies Internet Directory
If you’re running your online business in your off hours or between other
activities, you don’t have time to scour the Web for help. Not to fear: You can
find everything you need in this directory. It’s a collection of links to Web sites
and other Internet resources of special interest to individuals starting an online
business — especially if you’re working alone or at home and need to find
people to help you. Access it at www.dummies.com/go/onlinebusinessfd.
(On the Web site you’ll also find Bonus Chapter 1, which details ten ways of
ensuring online success.)
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I format important bits of information in special ways to make
sure that you notice them right away:
 In This Chapter lists: Chapters start with a list of the topics that I cover in
that chapter. This list represents a kind of table of contents in miniature.
 Numbered lists: When you see a numbered list, follow the steps in a spe-
cific order to accomplish a given task.
 Bulleted lists: Bulleted lists (like this one) indicate things that you can
do in any order or list related bits of information.
 Web addresses: When I describe activities or sites of interest on the World
Wide Web, I include the address, or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in a
special typeface like this: http://www.wiley.com/. Because the newer
versions of popular Web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer, don’t require you to enter the entire URL, this
book uses the shortened addresses. For example, if you want to connect
to the Wiley Publishing site, you can get there by simply entering the fol-
lowing in your browser’s Go To or Address box: www.wiley.com.
Don’t be surprised if your browser can’t find an Internet address you
type or if a Web page that’s depicted in this book no longer looks the
same. Although the sites were current when the book was written, Web
addresses (and sites themselves) can be pretty fickle. Try looking for a
missing site by using an Internet search engine. Or try shortening the
address by deleting everything after the .com (or .org or .edu).

Icons Used in This Book
Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 4th Edition, also uses special graph-
ical elements called icons to get your attention. Here’s what they look like and
what they mean:
This icon points out some technical details that may be of interest to you.

neurs who provided tips and instructions for running an online business.
This icon flags practical advice about particular software programs or about

This icon points out potential pitfalls that can develop into more major prob-
lems if you’re not careful.
This icon alerts you to facts and figures that are important to keep in mind as
you run your online business.
We’re in It Together
Improving communication is the whole point of this book. My goal is to help
you express yourself in the exciting new medium of the Internet and to remind
you that you’re not alone. I’m a businessperson myself, after all. So I hope that
you’ll let me know what you think about this book by contacting me. Check out

In this part . . .
W
hat all does starting an online business involve?
In this part, I answer that question with a brief
overview of the whole process. The following chapters
help you set your online business goals, draw up a blue-
print for meeting those goals, and explore new ways to
market your goods and services.
And just as dentists prepare their drills and carpenters
assemble their tools, you need to gather the necessary
hardware and software to keep your online business 
running smoothly. So, in this part, I discuss the business
equipment that the online store owner needs and suggest
ways that you can meet those needs even on a limited
budget.
Let the step-by-step instructions and real-life case studies
in this part guide you through the process of starting a
successful business online.

S
tarting an online business is no longer a novelty. It’s a fact of life for individ-
uals and established companies alike. The good news is that e-commerce
is here to stay and thriving once again. Not only that, but the steps required to
conduct commerce online are well within the reach of individuals like you and
me who have no prior business experience. New software and services make
creating Web pages and transacting online business easier than ever. Even
online businesses that were floundering a few years ago have figured out how
to work smarter and more successfully. All you need is a good idea, a bit of
start-up money, some computer equipment, and a little help from your friends.
One of my goals in this book is to be one of the friends who provides you with
the right advice and support to get your business online and make it a suc-
cess. In this chapter, I give you a step-by-step overview of the entire process
of starting an online business.
Step 1: Identify a Need
“The best of anything hasn’t been done yet,” says John Moen, the successful
e-businessperson profiled in this chapter. “The Web isn’t over. Someday some-
one is going to invent a better Wal-Mart, and there’s going to be a bigger and
better store. As the technology changes, someone is going to create a business
online that makes people say, ‘Holy cow, that’s cool.’” 

E-commerce and the Web have been around for a decade now. But new prod-
ucts and ways to sell them are being identified all the time. Think of the things
that didn’t exist when the first Web sites were created: MP3s, wireless modems,
DVDs, eBay. Consider my brother Mike: As I write this book, I am helping him
create his own online business, lp2cdsolutions, Inc. Like many entrepreneurs,
he reached a simple conclusion: “If I want this product so badly, I bet a lot of
other people do, too.” What he wanted was to convert his scratchy old records
to clean and repackaged CDs. He spent thousands of dollars on computer hard-
ware and software, and he got really good at audio restoration. Now he wants
to make money by doing the same for others. Will he succeed because he has
me to help him? I don’t think success is guaranteed. It depends on you —
your energy, dedication, and enthusiasm. You follow the progress of his site
in this and subsequent chapters. 
Your first job, accordingly, is to get in touch with your market (the people
who’ll be buying your stuff or using your services) and determine how you can
best meet its needs. After all, you can’t expect Web surfers to patronize your
online business unless you identify services or items that they really need. 
12
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 
A hotbed of commerce
Statistically, the Internet is a hotbed of 
commerce — and it just keeps getting hotter.
Listen to what the experts are saying:
 BizRate (www.bizrate.com) reported that
online shoppers spent $8.6 billion during the
2003 Christmas season, 24 percent more
than the year before. The top categories in
terms of sales were computer hardware,
electronics, and entertainment. However,
the categories that saw the strongest growth
were food and wine (up 58 percent over the
year before), gifts and flowers (up 56 percent),
and apparel (up 38 percent). 
 Statistics Canada (www.statcan.ca), the
Canadian government’s central statistical
agency, recently reported that e-commerce
sales in Canada in 2003 rose for the fourth
year in a row, jumping 40 percent from $13.7
billion in 2002 to $19.1 billion in 2003.
 eMarketer
(www.emarketer.com/
Report.aspx?b2c_us_jul04) cites The
U.S. Department of Commerce’s numbers
indicating that e-commerce sales in the
U.S. reached $56 billion in 2003, compared
with $44.3 billion in 2002. Nearly one-third of
2003 sales occurred in the holiday shopping
season in the fourth quarter. 
 Jupiter 
Research
(www.jupiter
research.com) predicts that online sales
of apparel and accessories, excluding shoes
and jewelry, will reach $7.5 billion in 2004,
from $6.2 billion the previous year. By 2008,
the number should hit $12 billion, accounting
for 4.9 percent of all apparel sales. 
Check out the Starting an Online Business For
Dummies, 4th Edition, Internet Directory on this
book’s Web site (located at www.dummies.
com/go/onlinebusinessfd) for links to
sites where you can gather fast facts and back-
ground information on doing business online.

Getting to know the marketplace
The Internet is a worldwide, interconnected network of computers to which
people can connect either from work or home, and through which people can
communicate via e-mail, receive information from the Web, and buy and sell
items by using credit cards or other means.
Many people decide to start an online business with little more than a casual
knowledge of the Internet. But when you decide to get serious about going
online with a commercial endeavor, it pays to get to know the environment in
which you plan to be working.
One of your first steps should be to find out what it means to do business
online and to determine the best ways for you to fit into the exploding field of
electronic commerce. For example, you need to realize that the Internet is a
personal place; that customers are active, not passive, in the way they absorb
information; and that the Net was established within a culture of people shar-
ing information freely and helping one another.
Some of the best places to find out about the culture of the Internet are the
newsgroups, chat rooms, and bulletin boards where individuals gather and
exchange messages online. Visiting discussion forums devoted to topics that
interest you personally can be especially helpful, and you’re likely to end up
participating. Also visit commerce Web sites, such as eBay, Amazon.com, or
other online marketplaces, and take note of ideas and approaches that you
may want to use.
“Cee-ing” what’s out there
The more information you have about the “three Cs” of the online world, the
more likely you are to succeed in doing business online:
 Competitors: Familiarize yourself with other online businesses that
already do what you want to do. Don’t let their presence intimidate
you. You’re going to find a different and better way to do what they
already do. 
 Customers: Investigate the various kinds of customers who shop online
and who might visit your site.
 Culture: Explore the special language and style people use when they
communicate.
13
Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

As you take a look around the Internet, notice the kinds of goods and services
that tend to sell in the increasingly crowded, occasionally disorganized, and
sometimes-complex online world. The things that sell best in cyberspace
include four Cs:
 Cheap: Online items tend to be sold at a discount — at least, that’s what
shoppers expect. 
 Customized: Anything that’s hard-to-find, personalized, or unique sells
well online.
 Convenient: Shoppers are looking for items that are easier to buy online
than at a “real” store, such as a rare book that you can order in minutes
from Amazon.com (www.amazon.com), or an electronic greeting card
that you can send online in seconds (www.greeting-cards.com).
 Content-rich: Consumers go online to quickly read news stories that are
available by subscription, such as newspapers and magazines, or that
exist online only, such as Web logs (blogs) and electronic publications
(ezines).
Visit one of the tried-and-true indexes to the Internet, such as Yahoo! (www.
yahoo.com), or the preeminent search service Google (www.google.com).
Enter a word or phrase in the site’s home page search box that describes the
kinds of goods or services you want to provide online. Find out how many
existing businesses already do what you want to do. Better yet, determine
what they don’t do, and set a goal of meeting that specialized need yourself.

Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 
Mapmaker locates his online niche
John Moen didn’t know a thing about computer
graphics when he first started his online business,
Graphic Maps, in 1995. He didn’t know how to
write HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the
set of instructions used to create Web pages. (Not
too many people in 1995 did.) But he did know a lot
about maps. And he heard that setting up shop
on the Web was “the thing to do.” He scraped
together $300 in start-up costs, learned to create
some simple Web pages without any photos
(only maps and other graphics), and went online. 
At first, business was slow. “I remember saying
to my wife, ‘You know what? We had ten page
views yesterday.’” The Graphic Maps site (www.
graphicmaps.com) was averaging about 30
page views per day when Moen decided to do
something that many beginners may find coun-
terproductive, even silly: He started giving away
his work for free. He created some free art
(called clip art) and made it available for people
to copy. And he didn’t stop there: He began
giving away his knowledge of geography. He
answered questions submitted to him by school-
children and teachers. 
Soon, his site was getting 1,000 visits a day. Today,
he reports, “We are so busy, we literally can’t
keep up with the demand for custom maps.
Almost 95 percent of our business leads come
from the Web, and that includes many interna-
tional companies and Web sites. Web page traffic
has grown to more than 3 million hits per month,
and banner advertising now pays very well.”

15
Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps
John now has six employees, receives many
custom orders for more than $10,000, and has
done business with numerous Fortune 500 com-
panies. To promote his site, John gives away free
maps for nonprofit organizations, operates a daily
geography contest with a $100 prize to the first
person with the correct answer, and answers
e-mail promptly. “I feel strongly that the secret
on the Web is to provide a solution for a problem,
and for the most part, do it free,” he suggests.
“If the service is high quality, and people get what
they want . . . they will tell their friends and all will
beat a path to your URL, and then, and only then,
will you be able to sell your products to the world,
in a way you never imagined was possible.”
Moen created a second site called worldatlas.
com (www.worldatlas.com, as shown here)
that is devoted to geography. That site generates
revenue from popup and banner ads that other
companies place there because so many people
visit. “It is not unusual to have 20 million impres-
sions on that site and hundreds of thousands of
geography questions a month from teachers and
students who need an answer to a geography
question,” says Moen.
When asked how he can spare the time to answer
questions for free when he has so much paying
business available, he responds: “How can you
not? I normally work 12-hour, and sometimes 16-
or 18-hour days. If some little kid, some student,
comes home from school, and says, ‘Grandpa, I
need to find out what’s the tallest mountain in
North America,’ and he does a search on Google
that directs him to go to worldatlas.com, we will
try to answer that question.”
His advice for beginning entrepreneurs: “Find
your niche and do it well. Don’t try to compete with
larger companies. For instance, I can’t compete
with Microsoft or Rand McNally, but I don’t try
to. Our map site, graphicmaps.com, is one of the
few custom map sites on the Web. There is no
software yet available today that will do auto-
matic mapping for a client. If you need a map for
a wedding or for your office, we can make you
one. I fill some needs that they don’t fill, and I
learned long ago how to drive business to my
site by offering something for free. The fact is
that if you have good ideas and you search for
clients, you can still do well on the Web.”

Figuring out how to do it better
After you take a look at what’s already out there, the next step is to find ways
to make your business stand out from the crowd. Direct your energies toward
making your site unique in some way and providing things that others don’t
offer. The things that set your online business apart from the rest can be as
tangible as half-price sales, contests, seasonal sales, or freebies. They can
also involve making your business site higher in quality than the others.
Maybe you can just provide better or more personalized customer service
than anyone else. 
What if you can’t find other online businesses doing what you want to do?
Lucky you! In electronic commerce, being first often means getting a head start
and being more successful than latecomers, even if they have more resources
than you do. (Just ask the owners of the online bookstore Amazon.com.) Don’t
be afraid to try something new and outlandish. It just might work!
Step 2: Determine What 
You Have to Offer
Business is all about identifying customers’ needs and figuring out exactly
what goods or services you’re going to provide to meet those needs. It’s the
same both online and off. (Often, you perform this step before or at the same
time that you scope out what the business needs are and figure out how you
can position yourself to meet those needs, as I explain in the earlier section
“Step 1: Identify a Need.”)
To determine what you have to offer, make a list of all the items you have to
put up for sale, or all the services that you plan to provide to your customers.
Next, you need to decide not only what goods or services you can provide
online, but also where you’re going to obtain them. Are you going to create
sale items yourself? Are you going to purchase them from another supplier?
Jot down your ideas on paper and keep them close at hand as you develop
your business plan.
The Internet is a personal, highly interactive medium. Be as specific as possi-
ble with what you plan to do online. Don’t try to do everything; the medium
favors businesses that do one thing well. The more specific your business,
the more personal the level of service you can provide to your customers.

Step 3: Come Up with a 
Cyberbusiness Plan
The process of setting goals and objectives and then designing strategies for
attaining them is essential when starting a new business. What you end up
with is called a business plan. A good business plan applies not only to the
start-up phase, but also to a business’s day-to-day operation. It can also be
instrumental in helping a small business obtain a bank loan.
Drawing up a business plan
To set specific goals for your new business, ask yourself these questions:
 Why do you want to start a business?
 Why do you want to start it online?
 What would you want to buy online?
 What would make you buy it?
These questions may seem simple. But many businesspeople never take the
time to answer them. And only you can answer these questions for yourself.
Make sure that you have a clear idea of where you’re going so that you can
commit to making your venture successful over the long haul. (See Chapter 2
for more on setting goals and envisioning your business.)
To carry your plan into your daily operations, observe these suggestions:
 Write a brief description of your company and what you hope to accom-
plish with it.
 Draw up a marketing strategy. (See Chapter 15 for tips.)
 Keep track of your finances. (See Chapter 17 for specifics.)
Consider using specialized software to help you prepare your business plan.
Programs such as Business Plan Pro by Palo Alto Software (www.palo-alto.
com) lead you through the process by asking you a series of questions as a
way of identifying what you want to do. The program retails for $99.95. I also
refer you to Business Plans For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Paul Tiffany and
Steven D. Peterson (Wiley).

Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

If you set aside part of your home for business purposes, you are eligible for
tax deductions. Exactly how much you can deduct depends on how much
space you use. (For example, I have a nine-room house, and one room serves
as my office, so I am able to deduct one-ninth of my utility bills and other
housing costs. The deduction is based on floor space, but my office takes up
about one-ninth of the total square footage in my house.) You can depreciate
your computers and other business equipment, too. On the other hand, your
municipality may require you to obtain a license if you operate a business in
a residential area; check with your local authorities to make sure that you’re
on the up and up. You can find out more about tax and legal issues, including
local licensing requirements, in Chapters 16 and 17 of this book.
Step 4: Assemble Your Equipment 
and Set Up Shop
One of the great advantages of opening a store on the Internet rather than on
Main Street is money — or rather, the lack of it. Instead of having to rent a
space and set up furniture and fixtures, you can buy a domain name, sign up
with a hosting service, create some Web pages, and get started with an invest-
ment of only a few hundred dollars, or perhaps even less.
In addition to your virtual storefront, you also have to find a real place to do
your business. You don’t necessarily have to rent a warehouse or other large
space. Many online entrepreneurs use a home office or perhaps a corner in a
room where computers, books, and other business-related equipment reside.
Finding a host for your Web site
Although doing business online means that you don’t have to rent space in a
mall or open a real, physical store, you do have to set up a virtual space for
your online business. You do so by creating a Web site and finding a company
to host it. In cyberspace, your landlord is called a Web hosting service. A Web
host is a company that, for a fee, makes your site available 24 hours a day by
maintaining it on a special computer called a Web server.
A Web host can be as large and well known as America Online, which gives
all its customers a place to create and publish their own Web pages. Some
Web sites, such as Yahoo! GeoCities (geocities.yahoo.com) or Tripod
(www.tripod.lycos.com), act as hosting services and provide easy-to-use
Web site creation tools as well. When my brother decided to create his Web
site, he signed up with a company called Webmasters.com, which charges
him about $14.95 per month and offers many features, including the form
shown in Figure 1-1 that enables you to create a simple Web page without
having to type any HTML.
18
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

In addition, the company that gives you access to the Internet — your
Internet service provider (ISP) — may also publish your Web pages. Make
sure that your host has a fast connection to the Internet and can handle the
large numbers of simultaneous visits, or hits, that your Web site is sure to
get eventually. You can find a detailed description of Web hosting options in
Chapter 3.
In Chapter 2, I describe two methods for selling your wares online that
don’t require a Web site — online classifieds and auctions. But most online
businesses find that having a Web site is indispensable for generating and
conducting sales. And hosts like America Online and Yahoo! make it easier
than ever to create your own site, as I discuss in Chapter 3.
Assembling the equipment you need
Think of all the equipment you don’t need when you set up shop online: You
don’t need shelving, a cash register, a parking lot, electricity, fire protection
systems, a burglar alarm . . . the list goes on and on. You may need some of
those for your home, but you don’t need to purchase them especially for
your online business.

Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

For doing business online, your most important piece of equipment is your
computer. Other hardware, such as scanners, modems, and monitors, are
essential, too. You need to make sure that your computer equipment is up
to snuff because you’re going to be spending a lot of time online: answering
e-mail, checking orders, revising your Web site, and marketing your product.
Expect to spend anywhere between $1,000 and $6,000 for equipment, if you
don’t have any to begin with.
It pays to shop wisely and get the best setup you can afford up front so that
you don’t have to purchase upgrades later on. (For more suggestions on
buying business hardware and software, see Chapter 2.)
Choosing business software
For the most part, the programs you need in order to operate an online 
business are the same as the software you use to surf the Internet. You do,
however, need to have a wider variety of tools than you would use for simple
information gathering.
20
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 
Keeping track of your inventory
It’s easy to overlook inventory and setting up
systems for processing orders when you are
just starting out. But as Lucky Boyd, an entre-
preneur who started MyTexasMusic.com and
other Web sites, pointed out to me, you need to
make sure you have a “big vision” early in the
process of creating your site. In his case, it meant
having a site that could handle lots of visitors
and make purchasing easy for them. In other
cases, it might mean having sufficient inventory
to meet demand. 
Having too many items for sale is preferable to not
having enough. “We operated on a low budget in
the beginning, and we didn’t have the inventory
that people wanted,” one entrepreneur com-
mented. “People online get impatient if they have
to wait for things too long. Make sure you have
the goods you advertise. Plan to be successful.”
Many online businesses keep track of their inven-
tory by using a database that’s connected to their
Web site. When someone orders a product from
the Web site, that order is automatically recorded
in the database, which then produces an order
for replacement stock.
In this kind of arrangement, the database serves
as a so-called back end or back office to the
Web-based storefront. This is a sophisticated
arrangement that’s not for beginners. However,
if orders and inventory get to be too much for you
to handle yourself, consider hiring a Web devel-
oper to set up such a system for you. If you’re
adventurous and technically oriented, you can
link a database to a Web site by using a product
such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver. For more
information about these products and how they
work, check out FrontPage 2003 For Dummies,
by Asha Dornfest, and Dreamweaver MX For
Dummies, by Janine Warner and Ivonne Berkowitz
(both by Wiley).

Because you’re going to be in the business of information providing now, as
well as information gathering, you need programs such as the following:
 A Web page editor: These programs, which you may also hear called
Web page creation tools or Web page authoring tools, make it easy for
you to format text, add images, and design Web pages without having
to master HTML.
 Graphics software: If you decide to create your business Web site your-
self, rather than find someone to do it for you, you need a program that
can help you draw or edit images that you want to include on your site.
 Storefront software: You can purchase software that leads you through
the process of creating a full-fledged online business and getting your
pages on the Web.
 Accounting programs: You can write your expenses and income on a
sheet of paper. But it’s far more efficient to use software that acts as a
spreadsheet, helps you with billing, and even calculates sales tax.
Step 5: Find People to Help You
Conducting online business does involve relatively new technologies, but
they aren’t impossible to figure out. In fact, the technology is becoming more
accessible all the time. Many people who start online businesses learn how to
create Web pages and promote their companies by reading books, attending
classes, or networking with friends and colleagues. Of course, just because you
can do it all doesn’t mean that you have to. Often, you’re better off hiring help,
either to advise you in areas where you aren’t as strong or simply to help you
tackle the growing workload — and help your business grow at the same time.
Hiring technical experts
Spending some money up front to hire professionals who can point you in the
right direction can help you maintain an effective Web presence for years to
come. Many businesspeople who usually work alone (myself included) hire
knowledgeable individuals to do design or programming work that they would
find impossible to tackle otherwise.
Don’t be reluctant to hire professional help in order to get your business
online. The Web is full of development firms that perform several related
functions: providing customers with Web access, helping to create Web sites,
and hosting sites on their servers. The expense for such services may be con-
siderable at first. The programming involved in setting up databases, creating
purchasing systems, and programming Web pages can run over $10,000 for
21
Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

particularly extensive Web sites, but they can pay off in the long term. Choose
a designer carefully, and check out sites they’ve done before. Tell them your
business plan, and spell out clearly what you want each page to do. Another
area where you may want to find help is in networking and computer mainte-
nance. You need to know how to do troubleshooting and find out how to keep
your computers running. Find out if you have a computer expert in your
neighborhood who is available on short notice.
If you do find a business partner, make sure that the person’s abilities bal-
ance your own. If you’re great at sales and public relations, for example, find
a writer or Web page designer to partner with.
Gathering your team members
Many entrepreneurial businesses are family affairs. For example, a husband-
and-wife team started Scaife’s Butcher Shop in England, which has a successful
Web site (www.jackscaife.co.uk). A successful eBay business, Maxwell Street
Market, is run by a husband-and-wife team as well as family members and neigh-
bors: The husband does the buying; the wife prepares sales descriptions; the
others help with packing and shipping. John Moen found some retired teachers
to help answer the geography questions that come into his worldatlas.com
site. The convenience of the Internet means that these geography experts
can log on to the site’s e-mail inbox from their respective homes and answer
questions quickly. (For more about John Moen and his Web site, see the
“Mapmaker locates his online niche” sidebar, earlier in this chapter.)
Early on, when you have plenty of time to do planning, you probably won’t
feel a pressing need to hire others to help you. Many people wait to seek help
when they have a deadline to meet or are in a financial crunch. Waiting to seek
help is okay — as long as you realize that you will need help, sooner or later.
Of course, you don’t have to hire family and friends, but you must find people
who are reliable and can make a long-term commitment to your project. Keep
these things in mind:
 Because the person you hire will probably work online quite a bit, pick
someone who already exhibits experience with computers and the
Internet.
 Online hiring practices work pretty much the same as those offline: You
should always review a résumé, get at least three references, and ask for
samples of the candidate’s work.
 Pick someone who responds promptly and courteously and who provides
the talents you need.
 If your only contact is by phone and e-mail, references are even more
important.
22
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Step 6: Construct a Web Site
Although you can make a living buying and selling full time on eBay, a Web
site is still likely to be the focus of your online business. Fortunately, Web
sites are becoming easier to create. You don’t have to know a line of HTML in
order to create an effective Web page yourself. Chapter 5 walks you through
the specific tasks involved in organizing and designing Web pages. Also, see
Chapter 6 for tips on making your Web pages content-rich and interactive.
Make your business easy to find online. Pick a Web address (otherwise known
as a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator) that’s easy to remember. You can
purchase a short domain-name alias, such as www.company.com, to replace
a longer one like www.internetprovider.com/~username/companyname/
index.html. If the ideal dot-com (.com) name isn’t available, you can choose
one of the newer domain suffixes such as .biz. See Chapter 3 and Chapter 8
for more information on domain name aliases.
Make your site content-rich
The textual component of a Web site is what attracts visitors and keeps
them coming back on a regular basis. The more useful information and com-
pelling content you provide, the more visits your site will receive. By compelling
content, I’m talking about words, headings, or images that induce visitors to
interact with your site in some way. You can make your content compelling in
a number of ways:
23
Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps
Who are the people in your neighborhood?
Try to find an expert or helper right in your own
neighborhood or town. In my own case, I work
with a graphic designer who lives right around
the corner from me, and he uses a consultant
who lives across the street from him. Ask around
your school or church, as well as other social
venues. Your neighbors may be able to help you
with various projects, including your online
business . . . and your online business just may
be able to help them, too.
Businesspeople who provide professional 
services also commonly recommend other con-
sultants in the course of e-mail communications.
Don’t work in a vacuum. Participate in mailing
lists and discussion groups online. Make con-
tacts and strike up cooperative relationships
with individuals who can help you.

 Provide a call to action, such as “Click Here!” or “Buy Now!”
 Explain how the reader will benefit by clicking a link and exploring your
site. (“Visit our News and Specials page to find out how to win 500 frequent
flyer miles.”)
 Briefly and concisely summarize your business and its mission.
 Scan or use a digital camera to capture images of your sale items (or of
the services you provide) as I describe in Chapter 5, and post them on a
Web page called Products.
Don’t forget the personal touch when it comes to connecting with your cus-
tomers’ needs. People who shop online don’t get to meet their merchants in
person, so anything you can tell about yourself helps to personalize the process
and put your visitors at ease. For example, one of Lucky Boyd’s primary goals
for his MyTexasMusic.com site is to encourage people to become members
so they are more likely to visit on a regular basis. His photos of music fans
(see Figure 1-2) personalize the site and remind visitors that they are members
of a community of music lovers. Let your cybervisitors know that they’re
dealing with real people, not remote machines and computer programs.

ness to

Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Peeking in on other businesses’ Web sites — to pick up ideas and see how
they handle similar issues — is a natural practice. In cyberspace, you can
visit plenty of businesses that are comparable to yours from the comfort of
your home office, and the trip takes only minutes.
Establishing a graphic identity
When you start up your first business on the Web, you have to do a certain
amount of convincing. You need to convince customers that you are compe-
tent and professional. One factor that helps build trust is a graphic identity. A
site with an identity looks a certain way. For example, take a look at Figure 1-3,
as well as Figure 1-4 later in this chapter. Both pages are from the Graphic
Maps Web site. Notice how each has the same white background, the same
distinctive and simple logo, and similar heading styles. Using such elements
consistently from page to page creates an identity that gives your business
credibility and helps viewers find what they’re looking for.

Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

Step 7: Set Up a System 
for Processing Sales
Many businesses go online and then are surprised by their own success.
They don’t have systems in place for finalizing sales, shipping out purchased
goods in a timely manner, and tracking finances and inventory.
An excellent way to plan for success is to set up ways to track your business
finances and to create a secure purchasing environment for your online cus-
tomers. That way, you can build on your success rather than be surprised by it.
Providing a means for secure transactions
Getting paid is the key to survival as well as success. When your business
exists only online, the payment process is not always straightforward. Make
your Web site a safe and easy place for customers to pay you. Provide differ-
ent payment options and build customers’ level of trust any way you can.
Although the level of trust among people who shop online is increasing steadily,
some Web surfers are still squeamish about submitting credit card numbers
online. And beginning businesspeople are understandably intimidated by the
requirements of processing credit card transactions. In the early stages, you
can simply create a form that customers have to print out and mail to you
along with a check. (The Graphic Maps site is successful without having an
online credit card system; clients phone in their orders.)
When you are able to accept credit cards, make your customers feel at ease
by explaining what measures you’re taking to ensure that their information is
secure. Such measures include signing up for an account with a Web host that
provides a secure server, a computer that uses software to encrypt data and
uses digital documents called certificates to ensure its identity. (See Chapters 7
and 12 for more on Internet security and secure shopping systems.)
Becoming a credit card merchant
The words electronic commerce or e-commerce bring to mind visions of online
forms and credit card data that is transmitted over the Internet. Do you have
to provide such service in order to run a successful online business? Not nec-
essarily. Being a credit card merchant makes life easier for your customers, to
be sure, but it also adds complications and extra costs to your operation.
26
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

The traditional way to become a credit card merchant is to apply to a bank.
Small and home-based businesses can have difficulty getting their applica-
tions approved. Alternatively, you can sign up with a company that provides
electronic “shopping cart” services and credit card payments online to small
businesses. See Chapter 12 for suggestions.
If you do get the go-ahead from a bank to become a credit card merchant, you
have to pay it a discount rate, which is a fee (typically, 2 to 3 percent of each
transaction). You sometimes have to pay a monthly premium charge of $10 to
$25 as well. Besides that, you may need special software or hardware to accept
credit card payments.
In the early stages of your business, you may find it easier to take orders over
the phone. Remember that most of your customers probably don’t have a
second phone line for Internet access, however. They have to disconnect from
the Internet to call and place their orders. Also invite them to send you an
e-mail message that provides contact information and states what they want
to order. Then if your business takes off, you can present your sales records
to the bank and be more likely to get your merchant application approved.
See Chapter 12 for more on electronic commerce options for your business.
To maximize your sales by reaching users who either don’t have credit cards
or don’t want to use them on the Internet, provide low-tech alternatives, such
as toll-free phone numbers and fax numbers, so that people can provide you
with information by using more familiar technologies.
After much searching, Lucky Boyd signed up with a company called
Goemerchant (www.goemerchant.com), which provides him with the payment
systems that many online shoppers recognize when they want to make a pur-
chase. First, there’s a shopping cart — a set of pages that acts as an electronic
“holding area” for items before they are purchased. Next, there’s a secure way
for people to make electronic purchases by providing online forms, where
people can safely enter credit card and other personal information. The note
stating that the payment area is protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption tells people that, even if a criminal intercepts their credit card
data, he won’t be able to read it.
Safeguarding your customers’ personal information is important, but you
also need to safeguard your business. Many online businesses get burned by
bad guys who submit fraudulent credit card information. If you don’t verify
the information and submit it to your financial institution for processing,
you’re liable for the cost. Strongly consider signing up with a service that
handles credit card verification for you in order to cut down on lost revenue.
See Chapter 7 for more on these and other security issues. 
27
Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

Keeping your books straight
What does “keeping your books” mean, anyway? In the simplest sense, it
means recording all financial activities that pertain to your business, including
any expenses you incur, all the income you receive, as well as your equip-
ment and tax deductions. The financial side of running a business also entails
creating reports, such as profit-and-loss statements, that banks require if you
apply for a loan. Such reports not only help meet financial institutions’ needs,
but also provide you with essential information about how your business is
really doing at any given time.
You can record all this information the old-fashioned way, by writing it down
in ledgers and journals, or you can use accounting software. (See Chapter 17
for some suggestions of easy-to-use accounting packages that are great for
financial novices.). Because you’re making a commitment to using computers
on a regular basis by starting an online business, it’s only natural for you to use
computers to keep your books, too. Accounting software can help you keep
track of expenses and provide information that may save you some headaches
at tax time. And after you’ve saved your financial data on your hard drive,
make backups so that you don’t lose information you need to do business.
See Chapter 7 for ways to back up and protect your files.
Step 8: Provide Personal Service
The Internet, which runs on wires, cables, and computer chips, may not seem
like a place for the personal touch. But technology didn’t actually create the
Internet and all of its content; people did that. In fact, the Internet is a great
place to provide your clients and customers with outstanding, personal cus-
tomer service.
In many cases, customer service on the Internet is a matter of being available
and responding quickly to all inquiries. You check your e-mail regularly; you
make sure you respond within a day; you cheerfully solve problems and hand
out refunds if needed. By helping your customers, you help yourself, too.
You build loyalty as well as credibility among your clientele. For many small
businesses, the key to competing effectively with larger competitors is by
providing superior customer service. See Chapter 13 for more ideas on how
you can do this.
Sharing your expertise
Your knowledge and experience are among your most valuable commodities.
So you may be surprised when I suggest that you give them away for free. Why?
28
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

It’s a “try before you buy” concept. Helping people for free builds your credi-
bility and makes them more likely to pay for your services down the road.
When your business is online, you can easily communicate what you know
about your field and make your knowledge readily available. One way is to
set up a Web page that presents the basics about your company and your
field of interest in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Another
technique is to become a virtual publisher/editor and create your own newslet-
ter in which you write about what’s new with your company and about topics
related to your work. See Chapter 13 for more on communicating your exper-
tise through FAQs, newsletters, and advanced e-mail techniques.
My brother was skeptical when I recommended to him that he include a page
full of technical information explaining exactly what equipment he uses and
describing the steps involved in audio restoration. He didn’t think anyone
would be interested; he also didn’t want to give away his “trade secrets.” Au
contraire, mon frère! People who surf the Internet gobble up all the technical
details they can find. The more you wow them with the names and model num-
bers of your expensive equipment, not to mention the work you go through to
restore their old records, the more they’ll trust you. And trust will get them
to place an order with you.
Making your site a go-to resource
Many ontrepreneurs (online entrepreneurs) succeed by making their Web
sites not only a place for sales and promotion but also an indispensable
resource, full of useful hyperlinks and other information, that customers
want to visit again and again. For example, the Graphic Maps Web site,
which I profile earlier in this chapter, acts as a resource for anyone who 
has a question about geography. To promote the site, John Moen gives
away free maps for nonprofit organizations, operates a daily geography con-
test with a $100 prize to the first person with the correct answer (shown in
Figure 1-4), and answers e-mail promptly. “I feel strongly that the secret on
the Web is to provide a solution to a problem and, for the most part, to do it
for free,” he suggests.
The MyTexasMusic site (www.mytexasmusic.com) uses the concept of mem-
bership to strengthen connections with customers. The main purpose of the
site is to make money by selling the works of Texas musicians, as well as tickets
to concerts. But in order to make money, you need to give people a reason to
visit your site on a regular basis.
29
Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

The site encourages music lovers and musicians to become members: They
provide information about who they are and where they live, and they create
their own username and password, so they can access special content and
perform special functions on the site such as selling their own CDs or posting
song clips online. For an online business, knowing the names and addresses
of people who visit and who don’t necessarily make purchases is a gold
mine of information. The business can use the contact information to send
members special offers and news releases; the more frequently contact is
maintained, the more likely those casual shoppers will eventually turn into
paying customers.
The concept of membership also builds a feeling of community among cus-
tomers. By turning the e-commerce site into a meeting place for members
who love Texas musicians, those members make new friends and have a
reason to visit the site on a regular basis. Community building is one way in
which commerce on the Web differs from traditional brick-and-mortar selling,
and it’s something you should consider, too.
Another way to encourage customers to congregate at your site on a regular
basis is to create a discussion area. In Chapter 13, I show you how to provide
a discussion page right on your own Web site.

Becoming a super e-mailer
E-mail is, in my humble opinion, the single most important marketing tool that
you can use to boost your online business. Becoming an expert e-mail user
increases your contacts and provides you with new sources of support, too.
The two best and easiest e-mail strategies are the following:
 Check your e-mail as often as possible.
 Respond to e-mail inquiries immediately.
Additionally, you can e-mail inquiries about comarketing opportunities to other
Web sites similar to your own. Ask other online business owners if they will
provide links to your site in exchange for you providing links to theirs. And
always include a signature file with your message that includes the name of
your business and a link to your business site. See Chapter 13 for more infor-
mation on using e-mail effectively to build and maintain relations with your
online customers.
Note: I’m encouraging you to use e-mail primarily for one-to-one communica-
tion. The Internet excels at bringing individuals together. Mailing lists and
newsletters can use e-mail effectively for marketing, too. However, I’m not
encouraging you to send out mass quantities of unsolicited commercial e-mail,
a practice that turns off almost all consumers and that can get you in trouble
with the law, too. You can read about a spammer who was sentenced to nine
years in prison under the state of Virginia’s anti-spam law at www.pcworld.

Step 9: Alert the Media 
and Everyone Else
In order to be successful, small businesses need to get the word out to the
people who are likely to purchase what they have to offer. If this group turns
out to be only a narrow market, so much the better; the Internet is great for
connecting to niche markets that share a common interest. (See Chapter 15
for more on locating your most likely customers on the Internet and figuring
out how best to communicate with them.)
The Internet provides many unique and effective ways for small businesses
to advertise, including search services, e-mail, newsgroups, electronic mail-
ing lists, and more.

Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

Listing your site with Internet 
search services
How, exactly, do you get listed on the search engines such as Yahoo! and Lycos?
Frankly, it’s getting more difficult. Many of the big search services charge for
listings. But some let you contribute a listing for free, though there’s no guar-
antee if or when you’ll see your site included in their databases.
You can increase the chances that search services will list your site by
including special keywords and site descriptions in the HTML commands for
your Web pages. You place these keywords after a special HTML command
(the <META> tag), making them invisible to the casual viewer of your site.
Turn to Chapter 15 for details.
John Moen and Lucky Boyd have both created multiple Web sites for different
purposes. One purpose is to reach different markets. Another is to improve
rankings on search engines such as Google: by linking one site to several other
sites, the site is considered more “popular” and its ranking rises. See Chapter 15
for more on this and other tips on getting listed by Internet search engines.
Reaching the entire Internet
Your Web site may be the cornerstone of your business, but if nobody knows
it’s out there, it can’t help you generate sales. Perhaps the most familiar form
of online advertising are banner ads, those little electronic billboards that
seem to show up on every popular Web page that you visit.
But banner advertising can be expensive and may not be the best way for a
small business to advertise online. In fact, the most effective marketing for
some businesses hasn’t been traditional banner advertising or newspaper/
magazine placements. Rather, the e-marketers who run those businesses
target electronic bulletin boards and mailing lists where people already dis-
cuss the products being sold. You can post notices on the bulletin boards
where your potential customers congregate, notifying them that your services
are now available. (Make sure the board in question permits such solicitation
before you do so, or you’ll chase away the very customers you want.)
This sort of direct, one-to-one marketing may seem tedious, but it’s often the
best way to develop a business on the Internet. Reach out to your potential
customers and strike up an individual, personal relationship with each one.
Chapter 15 contains everything you need to know about advertising with
mailing lists, newsgroups, and even traditional banner ads.

Step 10: Review, Revise, and Improve
For any long-term endeavor, you need to establish standards by which you
can judge its success or failure. You must decide for yourself what you con-
sider success to be. After a period of time, take stock of where your business
is, and then take steps to do even better.
Taking stock
After 12 months online, Lucky Boyd took stock. His site was online, but he
wasn’t getting many page views. He redid the site, increased the number of
giveaways, and traffic rose. Now, he wants to make music downloads available
on his site; he’s preparing to redo all of his Web pages with the Hypertext
Preprocessor programming language (PHP). 
HTML is a markup language: It identifies parts of a Web page that need to
be formatted as headings, text, images, and so on. It can be used to include
scripts, such as those written in the JavaScript language. But by creating his
pages from scratch using PHP, Lucky Boyd can make his site more dynamic
and easier to update. He can rotate random images, process forms, and 
compile statistics that track his visitors by using PHP scripts, for instance.
He can design Web pages in a modular way so they can be redesigned and
revised more quickly than with HTML, too. 
When all is said and done, your business may do so well that you can rein-
vest in it by buying new equipment or increasing your services. You may
even be in a position to give something back to nonprofits and those in need.
The young founders of The Chocolate Farm (www.thechocolatefarm.com)
set up a scholarship fund designed to bring young people from other coun-
tries to the United States to help them find out about free enterprise. Perhaps
you’ll have enough money left over to reward yourself, too — as if being able
to tell everyone “I own my own online business” isn’t reward enough!
Money is only one form of success. Plenty of entrepreneurs are online for 
reasons other than making money. That said, it is important from time to
time to evaluate how well you’re doing financially. Accounting software,
such as the programs that I describe in Chapter 17, makes it easy to check
your revenues on a daily or weekly basis. The key is to establish the goals
you want to reach and develop measurements so that you know when and if
you reach those goals.
33
Chapter 1: Opening Your Own Online Business in Ten Easy Steps

Updating your data
Getting your business online now and then updating your site regularly is
better than waiting to unveil the perfect Web site all at one time. In fact,
seeing your site improve and grow is one of the best things about going
online. Over time, you can create contests, strike up cooperative relation-
ships with other businesses, and add more background information about
your products and services.
Consider The Chocolate Farm, which is still owned and operated by Evan and
Elise MacMillan of Denver, Colorado. The business was started when Elise
was just 10 years old and Evan was 13. They began by selling chocolates with
a farm theme, such as candy cows; these days, they focus more on creating
custom chocolates — sweets made to order for businesses, many of which
bear the company’s logo. Evan, who manages the company’s Web site, now
updates it from his college dorm room in California. He and his sister oversee
the work of 50 full- and part-time employees. 
Businesses on the Web need to evaluate and revise their practices on a regu-
lar basis. Lucky Boyd studies reports of where visitors come from before they
reach his site, and what pages they visit on the site, so he can attract new
customers. Online business is a process of trial and error. Some promotions
work better than others. The point is that it needs to be an ongoing process
and a long-term commitment. Taking a chance and profiting from your mis-
takes is better than not trying in the first place.

Choosing and Equipping 
Your New E-Business
In This Chapter

 Understanding your options: sales, services, auctions, hike!
 Making your cybershop stand out from the crowd
 Obtaining or upgrading your computer hardware
 Assembling a business software suite
S
tarting your own online business is like rehabbing an old house — 
something I’m constantly doing. Both projects involve a series of 
recognizable phases:
 The idea phase: First, you tell people about your great idea. They hear
the enthusiasm in your voice, nod their heads, and say something like,
“Good luck.” They’ve seen you in this condition before and know how it
usually turns out.
 The decision phase: Undaunted, you begin honing your plan. You read
books (like this one), ask questions, and shop around until you find just
the right tools and materials. Of course, when the project is staring you
down in your own workshop, you may start to panic, asking yourself
whether you’re really up for the task.
 The assembly phase: Still determined to proceed, you forge ahead. You
plug in your tools and go to work. Drills spin, sparks fly, and metal moves.
 The test-drive phase: One fine day, out of the dust and fumes, your mas-
terpiece emerges. You invite everyone over to enjoy the fruits of your
labor. All of those who were skeptical before are now full of admiration.
You get enjoyment from your project for years to come.

If rehabbing a house doesn’t work for you, think about restoring an antique
auto, planning an anniversary party, or devising a mountain-climbing excur-
sion in Tibet. The point is that starting an online business is a project like
any other — one that you can understand and accomplish in stages. Right
now, you’re at the first stage of launching your new cyberbusiness. Your 
creativity is working overtime. You have some rough sketches that only a
mother could love.
This chapter helps you get from idea to reality. Your first step is to imagine
how you want your business to look and feel. Then you can begin to develop
and implement strategies for achieving your dream. You’ve got a big advan-
tage over those who started new businesses a few years ago: You’ve got
plenty of models to show you what works and what doesn’t.
As you travel along the path from idea to reality, you must also consider prop-
erly equipping your online business — just like you would have to equip a
traditional, brick-and-mortar business. One of the many exciting aspects of
launching a business online, however, is the absence of much overhead (that
is, operating expenses). Many non-cyberspace businesses must take out loans,
pay rent, remodel their storefronts, pay license fees, and purchase store fix-
tures. In contrast, the primary overhead for an online business is computer
hardware and software. Although it’s great if you can afford top-of-the-line
equipment, you’ll be happy to know that the latest bells and whistles aren’t
absolutely necessary in order to get a business site online and maintain it
effectively. But in order to streamline the technical aspects of connecting to
the online world and creating a business Web site, some investment may be a
wise and profitable idea.
Don’t rush into signing a contract to host your online business. I’ve encoun-
tered experienced businesspeople who prepaid for a year’s worth of Web
hosting with nothing else yet in place. Be sure that you know your options
and have a business strategy, no matter how simple, before you sign anything.
Mapping Out Your Online Business
How do you get to square one? Start by imagining the kind of business that is
your ultimate goal. This is the time to indulge in some brainstorming. Envi-
sioning your business is a creative way of asking yourself the all-important
questions: Why do I want to go into business online? What are my goals?
Table 2-1 illustrates some possible goals and suggests how to achieve them.
By envisioning the final result you want to achieve, you can determine your
online business goals.

Looking around
There’s no need to feel that you have to reinvent the wheel. Your ultimate
destination can be the best source of information on how to get there. Some-
times, spending just half an hour surfing the Net can stimulate your own
mental network. Find sites with qualities you want to emulate. Throughout
this book, I suggest good business sites you can visit to find good models to
follow. 
Because you are not unlike your target audience, your likes and dislikes have
value. Keep a low-tech pencil and pad of paper handy each time you surf for
ideas. Make a list as you go of what you find appealing and jot down notes on
logos, designs, and text. That way, you’ll have raw data to draw upon as you
begin to refine what you yourself want to do.
Making your mark
The Web and other parts of the online world have undergone a population
explosion. According to Internet Systems Consortium’s Domain Survey
(www.isc.org), in January 2004, 233.1 million computers that hosted Web
sites were connected to the Internet, compared with 171.6 million the year
before. Twenty percent of those computers host Web addresses that end
with the commercial (.com) designation.
37
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

As an ontrepreneur (online entrepreneur), your goal is to stand out from the
crowd — or to “position yourself in the marketplace,” as business consultants
like to say. Consider the following tried-and-true suggestions if you want your
Web site to be a go-to place:
 Pursue something you know well. Experience adds value to the infor-
mation that you provide. In the online world, expertise sells.
 Make a statement. On your Web site, include a mission statement that
clearly identifies what you do, the customers you hope to reach, and
how you’re different from your competitors.
 Give something away for free. Giveaways and promotions are surefire
ways to gain attention and develop a loyal customer base. In fact, there
are entire Web sites devoted to providing free stuff online, like iWon
(www.iwon.com) or WebStakes (www.webstakes.com). You don’t have
to give away an actual product; it can be words of wisdom based on
your training and experience.
 Find your niche. Web space is a great place to pursue niche marketing.
In fact, it often seems that the quirkier the item, the better it sells. Don’t
be afraid to target a narrow audience and direct all your sales efforts to
a small group of devoted followers.
 Do something you love. The more you love your business, the more time
and effort you’re apt to put into it and, therefore, the more likely it is to be
successful. Such businesses take advantage of the Internet’s worldwide
reach, which makes it easy for people with the same interests to gather
at the same virtual location.
Scan through the list of Inc. magazine’s (www.inc.com) Top 500 privately held
companies, and you find many examples of businesses that follow all the afore-
mentioned strategies. The 26-year-old CEO of the number 2 company for 2004,
uSight (www.usight.com), almost closed his company in its second year
before finding his niche: a do-it-yourself Web site application called uBuilder.
Go Daddy (www.godaddy.com) switched from Web building software to
domain name registration and became number 8 in 2004. High Point Solutions
(www.highpt.com), the top-ranked company in Inc. magazine’s 500 List for
2001, was started by two brothers who skipped college and began the busi-
ness in their home in Sparta, New Jersey. The company focuses on a niche:
helping a small but very satisfied group of corporate customers iron out the
logistical details of buying network hardware. They find good prices on new
and used equipment and deliver products fast. 
Evaluating commercial Web sites
How is your business the same as others? How is it different than others? These
are questions your customers will be asking, so you may as well start out by
asking them also. Commercial Web sites — those whose Internet addresses
end with .com or .biz — are the fastest-growing segment of the Net. This is
38
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

the area you’ll be entering, too. The trick is to be comfortable with the size and
level of complexity of a business that’s right for you. In general, your options are
 A big commercial Web site: The Web means big business, and plenty of
big companies create Web sites with the primary goal of supplementing
a product or business that’s already well known and well established. Just
a few examples are the Ragu Web site (www.ragu.com), the Pepsi World
Web site (www.pepsiworld.com), and the Toyota Web site (www.toyota.
com). True, these commercial Web sites were created by corporations
with many thousands of dollars to throw into Web design, but you can
still look at them to get ideas for your own site.
 A mid-size site: Many a small business of ten to twelve employees makes
good use of the Web to provide customer service, disseminate informa-
tion, and post a sales catalog. I describe many of these functions in my
book Small Business Internet For Dummies (Wiley). Some features that
mid-size companies use, such as a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
page or a sales catalog, may be useful to you. Look at the Golfballs.com
site (www.golfballs.com) for good ideas.
 A site that’s just right: There are no prerequisites for prior business expe-
rience that guarantee success on the Web. It’s also fine to start out as a
single person, couple, or family. In fact, the rest of this book is devoted
to helping you produce a very fine homegrown entrepreneurial business.
This chapter gets you off to a good start by examining the different kinds
of businesses you can launch online and some business goals you can
set for yourself.
Flavors of Online Businesses 
You Can Taste Test
If you’re easily overstimulated, you may feel like you need blinders as you
comb the Internet for ideas to give your online business a definite shape and
form. Use the following brief descriptions of online businesses to create cat-
egories of interest and then zero in on the ones that will be most useful to you.
Selling consumer products
Leading Internet research firm Forrester Research (www.clickz.com/stats/
markets/retailing/article.php/3390571) predicts that total e-commerce
sales in the U.S. will grow from $144 billion in 2004 to $316 billion in 2010. The
online marketplace is a great venue if you have products to sell (such as auto
parts, antiques, jewelry, or food). The Web has always attracted those looking
for unique items or something customized just for them. Consider taking your
wares online if one or more of the following applies to you:
39
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

 Your products are high in quality.
 You create your own products; for example, you design dishes, make
fudge, or sell gift baskets of wine.
 You specialize in some aspects of your product that larger businesses
can’t achieve. Perhaps you sell regional foods, such as Chicago deep-
dish pizza or live lobsters from Maine.
Ice cream may not be good for my waistline, but I often go to the Web site
of Ben and Jerry’s (www.benjerry.com) just to drool. These guys are entre-
preneurs just like you, and I like their Web site as well as their products. It
focuses on the unique flavors and high quality of their ice cream, as well as
their personalities and business standards.
So c’mon in; the water’s fine. The key is to find your niche, as many small-but-
successful businesses have done. Use your Web space to declare your love for
your products (and, by implication, why your customers will love them, too).
Hanging out your professional services
Either through a Web site or through listings in indexes and directories, offer-
ing your professional services online can expand your client base dramatically.
It also gives existing clients a new way to contact you: through e-mail. Here are
just a few examples of professionals who are offering their services online:
 Attorneys: Immigration attorney Kevin L. Dixler is based in Chicago.
Through his Web site (www.dixler.com), he can reach individuals
around the world who want to come to the United States.
 Psychotherapists: Carole Killick, a music psychotherapist, has a simple,
nicely designed Web site (www.eclipse.co.uk/pens/killick) that
explains her work and the courses she teaches.
 Physicians: Dr. Peter J. Dorsen, a physician in Minneapolis, Minnesota,
has a Web site (www.housecalldocs.com) that explains what he does
that sets him apart from other doctors: His practice is based entirely on
making “house calls.”
 Consultants: Experts who keep their knowledge up-to-date and are will-
ing to give advice to those with similar interests and needs are always in
demand. Consultants in a specialized area often find a great demand for
their services on the Internet. The Yahoo! consulting page is crowded
with fields in which online consultants are available:
dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/
consulting
40
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

We’re busy people who don’t always have the time to pore over the fine print.
Short and snappy nuggets of information will draw customers to your site
and make them feel as though they’re getting “something for free.” One way
you can put forth this professional expertise is by starting your own online
newsletter. You get to be editor, writer, and mailing-list manager. Plus, you get
to talk as much as you want, network with tons of people who are interested
enough in what you have to say to subscribe to your publication, and put
your name and your business before lots of people. Judy Vorfeld (profiled in
Chapter 6) puts out a regular newsletter called Communication Expressway
that supplements her online business site (www.ossweb.com), as do Marques
Vickers and many of the other online businesspeople I mention in this chapter.
Selling your expertise
The original purpose of the Internet was to share knowledge via computers,
and information is the commodity that has fueled cyberspace’s rapid growth.
As the Internet and commercial online networks continue to expand, informa-
tion remains key.
Finding valuable information and gathering a particular kind of resource for
one location online can be a business in itself. People love to get knowledge
they trust from the comfort of their own homes. For example, students and
parents are eager to pay someone to help them sort through the procedures
involved and the data required to apply for college. (See educational consultant
Cornelia Nicholson’s Web site, www.collegecounselor.com, for example.)
Other online businesses provide gathering points or indexes to more specific
areas. Here are just a few examples:
 Search engines: Some businesses succeed by connecting cybersurfers
with companies, organizations, and individuals that specialize in a given
area. Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) is the most obvious example. Originally
started by two college students, Yahoo! has practically become an Internet
legend by gathering information in one index so that people can easily
find things online.
 Links pages: On her “Grandma Jam’s I Love to Win” sweepstakes site,
(www.grandmajam.com), Janet Marchbanks-Aulenta gathers links to cur-
rent contests along with short descriptions of each one. Janet says her
site receives as many as 22,000 visits per month, and generates income
through advertising and affiliate links to other contest Web sites. She says
she loves running her own business despite the hard work involved with
keeping it updated. “The key to succeeding at this type of site is to build
up a regular base of users that return each day to find new contests —
the daily upkeep is very important,” she says.
41
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

 Personal recommendations: The personal touch sells. Just look at
About.com (www.about.com). This guide to the online world provides
Web surfers with a central location where they can locate virtually 
anything. It works because real people do the choosing and provide
evaluations (albeit brief) of the sites they list.
There are a number of ways that resource sites such as these can transform
information into money. In some cases, individuals pay to become members;
sometimes, businesses pay to be listed on a site; other times, a site attracts
so many visitors on a regular basis that other companies pay to post adver-
tising on the site. Big successes — such as About.com — carry a healthy
share of ads and strike lucrative partnerships with big companies, as well.
Opportunities with technology 
or computer resources
What could be more natural than using the Web to sell what you need to get
and stay online? The online world itself, by the very fact that it exists, has
spawned all kinds of business opportunities for entrepreneurs:
 Computers: Some discount computer houses have made a killing by
going online and offering equipment for less than conventional retail
stores. Being on the Internet means that they save on overhead,
employee compensation, and other costs, and they are able to pass
those savings on to their customers.
 Internet Service Providers: These are the businesses that give you a
dialup or direct connection to the Internet. Many ISPs, such as Netcom
or UUNET, are big concerns. But smaller companies — such as YourNET
Connection (www.ync.net), which is based in Schaumburg, Illinois, and
offers free online Web training for its customers, are succeeding, as well.
 Software: Matt Wright is well known on the Web for providing free 
computer scripts that add important functionality to Web sites, such
as processing information that visitors submit via online forms. Matt’s
Script Archive site (worldwidemart.com/scripts) now includes an
advertisement for a book on scripting that he coauthored, as well as a
Web postcard system for sale and an invitation to businesses to take out
advertisements on his site.
Being a starving artist without the starving
Being creative no longer means you have to live out of your flower-covered van,
driving from art fairs to craft shows. If you’re simply looking for exposure and
42
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

feedback on your creations, you can put samples of your work online. Consider
the following suggestions for virtual creative venues (and revenues):
 Host art galleries. Thanks to online galleries, artists whose sales were
previously limited to one region can get inquiries from all over the world.
Art Xpo (www.artxpo.com) reports thousands of dollars in sales through
its Web site and aggressive marketing efforts. The personal Web site cre-
ated by artist Marques Vickers (www.marquesv.com), has received world-
wide attention; see Figure 2-1. (The upcoming sidebar, “Painting a new
business scenario,” profiles Vickers’ site.)
 Publish your writing. Blogs (Weblogs, or online diaries) are all the rage
these days. The most successful are generating ad revenue. To find out
how to create one yourself, check out Blogger (www.blogger.com). 
 Sell your music. Singer-songwriter Michael McDermott sells his own
CDs, videos, and posters through his online store (www.michael-
mcdermott.com).
You can, of course, also sell all that junk that’s been accumulating in your
basement, as well as your relatives’ and family members’ junk, on eBay; see
Chapter 10 for more information on this exciting business opportunity.

Marketing One-to-One to Your Customers
After you review Web sites that already conduct the sorts of business ventures
that interest you, it’s time to put your goals into action. First you develop
marketing strategies that are well suited to expressing your unique talents
and services. That will encourage customers to explore your business and
place orders with you.
Does anyone still really believe that cyberspace is a place where millions of
lonely, disconnected people interact without really getting to know one
another? Your marketing strategy will debunk that myth. The fact is that
online communities are often close-knit, long-standing groups of people who
get to be great friends. The best way to promote your business is to commu-
nicate with people as individuals. The Web, newsgroups, and e-mail enable
you to accomplish this goal in ways that other media can’t match.
44
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 
Painting a new business scenario
Marques Vickers is an artist based in Vallejo,
California. Through his self-named Web site
(www.marquesv.com), as well as 15–20 “mini-
sites,” he markets his own painting, sculpture, and
photography, as well as his books on marketing
and buying fine art online. He first went online
in November 1999 and spends about 20 hours a
week working on his various Web sites. His sites
receive anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 visits
per month.
Q. What are the costs of running all your Web
sites and doing the associated marketing?
A. Out of pocket expense is approximately $29
monthly for a Web site hosting and Internet
access package. New domain name registra-
tions and renewals probably add another $250
since I own more than 20 domain names.
Q. What would you describe as the primary
goals of your online business?
A. My initial objective was to develop a person-
alized round-the-clock global presence in order
to recruit sales outlets, sell directly to the public,
and create a reference point for people to access
and view my work. I also have an intuitive sense
that an online Web site presence will be a mar-
keting necessity for any future visual artist and
a lifelong exposure outlet. Having an online pres-
ence builds my credibility as a fine artist and
positions me to take advantage of the evolution
of the fine arts industry, too.
Q. Has your online business been profitable
financially?
A. Absolutely — but make no mistake, achieving
sales volume and revenue is a trial-and-error
process and involves a significant time commit-
ment. I’m still perfecting the business model and
it may require years to achieve the optimum
marketing plan.

Focus on a customer segment
Old-fashioned business practices, such as getting to know your customers as
individuals and providing personal service, are alive and well in cyberspace.
Your number one business strategy, when it comes to starting your business
online, sounds simple: Know your audience.
What’s not so simple about this little maxim is that, in cyberspace, it takes
some work to get to know exactly who your customers are. Web surfers don’t
leave their names, addresses, or even a random e-mail address when they visit
your site. Instead, when you check the raw, unformatted records (or logs)
of the visitors who have connected to you, you see pages and pages of what
appears to be computer gobbledygook. You need special software to inter-
pret the information, such as the program WebTrends.
45
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
Q. How do you promote your site?
A. With the Internet, you are layering a collec-
tive web of multiple promotional sources.
Experimentation is essential because recogni-
tion is not always immediate but may ultimately
be forthcoming since postings in cyberspace
are often stumbled across from unforeseen
resources. I try multiple marketing outlets includ-
ing paid ad positioning services such as Overture
and Google, bartered advertising space, and
reciprocally traded links. Some have had moder-
ate success, some unforeseen and remarkable
exposure. Unlike traditional advertising media
that have immediate response times, the Internet
may lag in its response. It is a long-term com-
mitment and one that cannot be developed by
short-term tactics or media blitzes.
Q. Do you create your Web pages yourself or do
you work with someone to do that?
A. I’m too particular about the quality of content
to subcontract the work out. Besides, I know
what I want to say, how, and am capable of fash-
ioning the design concepts I want to integrate.
The rectangular limitations of HTML design
make color a very important component and the
very minimal attention span of most Web viewers
means that you’d better get to the point quickly
and concisely. The more personalized, timely,
and focused your content, the more reason an
individual has to return to your Web site and
ultimately understand your unique vision of what
you’re trying to create. A Web site is an unedited
forum for telling your version of a story and a
means for cultivating a direct support base.
Q. What advice would you give to someone
starting an online business?
A. Don’t hesitate one minute longer than neces-
sary. Read substantially and from a diverse
selection of sources on the subject. Subscribe
to ezines on related subject matter and query
the Webmasters of sites that impress you with
their content. Go to informational seminars; ask
questions. Experiment with marketing ideas and
by all means, consider it a lifelong project. The
Internet is continuing to evolve and the oppor-
tunities have never been more prevalent.

How do you develop relationships with your customers?
 Get your visitors to identify themselves. Have them send you e-mail
messages, place orders, enter contests, or provide you with feedback.
(For more specific suggestions, see Chapter 6.)
 Become an online researcher. Find existing users who already pur-
chase goods and services online that are similar to what you offer.
Visit newsgroups that pertain to what you sell, search for mailing
lists, and participate in discussions so that people can find out more
about you. 
 Keep track of your visitors. Count the visitors who come to your site
and, more important, the ones who make purchases or seek out your
services. Manage your customer profiles so that you can sell your exist-
ing clientele the items they’re likely to buy.
 Help your visitors get to know you. Web space is virtually unlimited.
Don’t be reluctant to tell people about aspects of your life that don’t
relate directly to how you hope to make money. Consider Judy Vorfeld,
who does Internet research, Web design, and office support. Her Web
site (www.ossweb.com) includes the usual lists of clients and services;
however, it also includes a link to her personal home page and a page
that describes her community service work. (See Figure 2-2.)

Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

I recommend doing your own Internet research so that you can find out more
about the culture of the online world: how the most successful Web sites look
and feel, and how many Web sites use a hip, techno-savvy tone when present-
ing information. 
After you get to know your audience, job number two in your marketing strat-
egy is to catch their attention. You have two ways to do this:
 Make yourself visible. In Web-space, the problem isn’t so much that
potential customers are surfing right past your site. Rather, your task
is simply making them aware that your site exists at all. You do this by
getting yourself included in as many indexes, search sites, and business
listings as possible. Chapter 14 outlines some strategies for listing your-
self with search engines, and Chapter 15 describes publicity options on
other parts of the Web. You can also do a bit of self-promotion in your own
online communications: John Counsel of the Profit Clinic (www.profit
clinic.com) appends this interesting teaser, followed by a link to his
Web site, to his e-mail messages:
“90% of all small business owners are PRE-PROGRAMMED to
FAIL. Are you one of them? Find out now with our Quick
Quiz”
 Make your site an eye-catcher. Getting people to come to you is only
half the battle. The other half is getting them to shop after they’re there.
Consider the importance of combining striking images with promotions,
offering useful information, and providing ways for customers to interact
with you. (See Chapters 5 and 6 for details.)
Boost your credibility
Marketing task number three is to transfer your confidence and sense of
authority about what you do to anyone who visits you online. Convince people
that you’re an expert and a trustworthy person with whom to do business.
In this case, customers have reasons to be wary. The Web has been around
only since the mid ’90s, so everyone is a relative newcomer to online com-
merce and there are some who are dishonest. Here, too, you can do a quick
two-step in order to market your expertise.
Document your credentials
Feature any honors, awards, or professional affiliations you have that relate
to your online work. If you’re providing professional or consulting services
online, you might even make a link to your online résumé. Give details about
how long you’ve been in your field and how you got to know what you know
about your business.
47
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

If these forms of verification don’t apply to you, all is not lost. Just move to
the all-important technique that I describe next.
Convince with must-have information
Providing useful, practical information about a topic is one of the best ways to
market yourself online. One of the great things about starting an online busi-
ness is that you don’t have to incur the design and printing charges to get a
brochure or flyer printed. You have plenty of space on your online business
site to talk about your sales items or services in as great detail as you want.
Most Internet service providers give you 20MB (megabytes, that is) or more
of space for your Web pages and associated files. Because the average Web
page occupies only 5 to 10K (that’s kilobytes) of space not counting the
space taken up by images and multimedia files, it’ll take a long time before
you begin to run out of room.
What, exactly, can you talk about on your site? Here are some ideas:
 Provide detailed descriptions and photos of your sale items.
 Include a full list of clients you have worked for previously.
 Publish a page of testimonials from satisfied customers.
 Give your visitors a list of links to Web pages and other sites where
people can find out more about your area of business.
 Toot your own horn: Explain why you love what you do and why you’re
so good at it.
Ask satisfied customers to give you a good testimonial. All you need is a sen-
tence or two that you can use on your Web site.
A site that contains compelling, entertaining content will become a resource
that online visitors bookmark and return to on a regular basis. Be sure to
update it regularly, and you will have fulfilled the dream of any online busi-
ness owner.
Customer to customer contact: 
Everyone wins
A 16-year-old cartoonist named Gabe Martin put his cartoons on his Web site,
called The Borderline. Virtually nothing happened. But when his dad put up
some money for a contest, young Gabe started getting hundreds of visits and
inquiries. He went on to create 11 mirror sites around the world, develop a
base of devoted fans, and sell his own cartoon book.

Cybersurfers regularly take advantage of freebies online by, for example,
downloading shareware or freeware programs. They get free advice from
newsgroups, and they find free companionship from chat rooms and online
forums. Having already paid for network access and computer equipment,
they actually expect to get something for free.
Your customers will keep coming back if you devise as many promotions,
giveaways, or sales as possible. You can also get people to interact through
online forums or other tools, as I describe in Chapter 6.
In online business terms, anything that gets your visitors to click links and
enter your site is good. Provide as many links to the rest of your site as you can
on your home page. Many interactions that don’t seem like sales do lead to
sales, and it’s always your goal to keep people on your site as long as possible.
See Chapters 5 and 6 for instructions on how to create hyperlinks and add
interactivity to your Web site. For more about creating Web sites, check out
Creating Web Pages For Dummies, 7th Edition, by Bud E. Smith and Arthur
Bebak (Wiley).
Be a player in online communities
You may wait until the kids go off to school to tap away at your keyboard in
your home office, but that doesn’t mean that you really are alone. Thousands
of home-office workers and entrepreneurs just like you connect to the Net
every day and share many of the same concerns, challenges, and ups and
downs as you.
Starting an online business isn’t only a matter of creating Web pages, scan-
ning photos, and taking orders. Marketing and networking are essential to
making sure that you meet your goals. Participate in groups that are related
either to your particular business or to online business in general. Here are
some ways that you can make the right connections and get support and
encouragement at the same time.
Be a newsgroupie
Newsgroups are discussion groups that occupy an extensive and popular part
of the Internet called Usenet, as well as appear on America Online and other
online services. Many large organizations such as universities and corpora-
tions run their own internal newsgroups, too.
Businesspeople tend to overlook newsgroups because of admonitions about
spam (unsolicited messages sent by people trying to sell something to news-
group participants who don’t want it) and other violations of Netiquette (the set
of rules that govern newsgroup communications). However, when you approach
newsgroup participants on their own terms (not by spamming them but by
49
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

answering questions and participating in discussions), newsgroups can be a
wonderful resource for businesspeople. They attract knowledgeable consumers
who are strongly interested in a topic — just the sorts of people who make
great customers.
A few newsgroups (in particular, the ones with biz at the beginning of their
names) are especially intended to discuss small business issues and sales.
Here are a few suggestions:
 misc.entrepreneurs
 biz.marketplace.discussion
 biz.marketplace.international.discussion
 biz.marketplace.services.discussion
 alt.business.home
 alt.business.consulting
 alt.business.franchise
 aol.commerce.general
The easiest way to access newsgroups is to use Google’s Web-based direc-
tory (groups.google.com). You can also use the newsgroup software that
comes built into the two most popular Web browser packages, Netscape
Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Each browser or newsgroup
program has its own set of steps for enabling you to access Usenet. Use your
browser’s online help system to find out how you can access newsgroups.
Be sure to read the group’s FAQ (frequently asked questions) page before you
start posting. It’s a good idea to lurk before you post — that is, simply read
messages being posted to the group in order to find out about members’ con-
cerns before posting a message yourself. Stay away from groups that seem to
consist only of get-rich-quick schemes or other scams. When you do post a
message, be sure to keep your comments relevant to the conversation and
give as much helpful advice as you can.
The most important business technique in communicating by either e-mail or
newsgroup postings is to include a signature file at the end of your message.
A signature file is a simple text message that newsgroup and mail software
programs automatically add to your messages. A typical one includes your
name, title, and the name of your company. You can also include a link to
your business’s home page. A good example is Judy Vorfeld’s signature file,
shown in Figure 2-3. (Chapter 13 tells how to create your own signature file.)
50
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Be a mailing list-ener
A mailing list is a discussion group that communicates by exchanging e-mail
messages between members who share a common interest and who have
subscribed to join the list. Each e-mail message sent to the list is distributed
to all the list’s members. Any of those members can, in turn, respond by
sending e-mail replies. The series of back-and-forth messages develops into
discussions.
The nice thing about a mailing list is that it consists only of people who have
subscribed to the list, which means that they really want to be involved and
participate.
An excellent mailing list to check out is the Small and Home-Based Business
Discussion List (www.talkbiz.com/bizlist/index.html). This list is 
moderated, meaning that someone reads through all postings before they
go online and filters out any comments that are inappropriate or off-topic.
Also, try searching the Topica directory of discussion groups (www.lists.
topica.com). Click Small Business (under Choose from Thousands of
Newsletters and Discussions) to view a page full of discussion groups and
other resources for entrepreneurs.
The number of groups you join and how often you participate in them is up
to you. The important thing is to regard every one-to-one-personal contact as
a seed that may sprout into a sale, a referral, an order, a contract, a bit of
useful advice, or another profitable business blossom.

It’s not a newsgroup or a mailing list, but a Web site called iVillage.com (www.
ivillage.com) brings women together by providing chat rooms where they
can type messages to one another in real time, as well as message boards
where they can post messages. (Men, of course, can participate, too.) Experts
(and some who just claim to be experts) often participate in these forums.
The work-from-home section (www.ivillage.com/work) is a good one for
online entrepreneurs like you.
Add ways to sell and multiply your profits
Many successful online businesses combine more than one concept of what
constitutes electronic commerce. Chapter 8 discusses ways to sell your goods
and services on your Web site, but the Internet offers other venues for pro-
moting and selling your wares.
Free income for your Web site
You can make money on your Web site without having anything to sell. Some
sites will pay you for building your page with them or linking to them. You
find out more in Chapter 4, but here are some quick suggestions:
 We’ll pay you to join: Usually, you pay a membership fee to join some-
thing. But if you build your Web site on Tripod (www.tripod.lycos.com)
and get enough visits, they’ll pay you cash through a program called
Builder Bucks.
 Lucrative links: If you become a member of Yahoo! GeoCities (www.
geocities.yahoo.com) and locate your Web site there (see Chapter 3),
you can join the Pages that Pay Affiliate Program, in which you make
links to specified business Web sites. You receive commissions for each
visitor who goes to the business’s Web site from yours. Amazon.com
(www.amazon.com) has had a similar program for years.
Selling through online classifieds
If you’re looking for a quick and simple way to sell products or promote your
services online without having to pay high overhead costs, consider taking
out a classified ad in an online publication or a popular site like Craigslist
(www.craigslist.org).
The classifieds work the same way online as they do in print publications:
You pay a fee and write a short description along with contact information, and
the publisher makes the ad available to potential customers. However, online
classifieds have a number of big advantages over their print equivalents:
52
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

 Audience: Rather than hundreds or thousands who might view your ad
in print, tens of thousands or perhaps even millions can see it online.
 Searchability: Online classifieds are often indexed so that customers
can search for particular items with their Web browser. This makes it
easier for shoppers to find exactly what they want, whether it’s a
Precious Moment figurine or a Martin guitar.
 Time: On the Net, ads are often online for a month or more.
 Cost: Some sites, such as Commerce Corner (www.comcorner.com), let
you post classified ads for free.
On the downside, classifieds are often buried at the back of online magazines
or Web sites, just as they are in print, so they’re hardly well-traveled areas.
Also, most classifieds don’t make use of the graphics that help sell and pro-
mote goods and services so effectively throughout the Web.
Classifieds are an option if you’re short on time or money. But don’t forget
that on your own online business site you can provide more details and not
have to spend a cent.
Selling via online auctions
Many small businesses, such as antique dealerships or jewelry stores, sell
individual merchandise through online auctions. eBay and other popular auc-
tion sites provide effective ways to target sales items at collectors who are
likely to pay top dollar for desirable goodies. If you come up with a system
for finding things to sell and for turning around a large number of transac-
tions on a regular basis, you can even turn selling on eBay into a full-time
source of income. See Chapter 10 for more about starting a business on eBay.
Easyware (Not Hardware) 
for Your Business
Becoming an information provider on the Internet places an additional burden
on your computer and peripheral equipment. When you’re “in it for the money,”
you may very well start to go online every day, and perhaps hours at a time,
especially if you buy and sell on eBay. The better your computer setup, the
more e-mail messages you can download, the more catalog items you can
store, and so on. In this section, I introduce you to many upgrades you may
need to make to your existing hardware configuration.
53
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

Some general principles apply when assembling equipment (discussed in
this section) and programs (discussed in a subsequent section, “Software
Solutions for Online Business”) for an online endeavor:
 Look on the Internet for what you need. You can find just about every-
thing you want to get you started.
 Be sure to pry before you buy! Don’t pull out that credit card until you
get the facts on what warranty and technical support your hardware or
software vendor provides. Make sure that your vendor provides phone
support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Also ask how long the typical
turnaround time is in case your equipment needs to be serviced.
If you purchase lots of new hardware and software, remember to update your
insurance by sending your insurer a list of your new equipment. Also consider
purchasing insurance specifically for your computer-related items from a
company such as Safeware (www.safeware.com). 
The right computer for your online business
You very well may already have an existing computer setup that’s adequate
to get your business online and start the ball rolling. Or you may be starting
from scratch and looking to purchase a computer for personal and/or busi-
ness use. In either case, it pays to know what all the technical terms and
specifications mean. Here are some general terms you need to understand:
 Gigahertz (GHz) and megahertz (MHz): This unit of measure indicates
how quickly a computer’s processor can perform functions. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is where the computing work gets
done. In general, the higher the processor’s internal clock rate, the
faster the computer. 
 Random access memory (RAM): This is the memory that your computer
uses to temporarily store information needed to operate programs. RAM
is usually expressed in millions of bytes, or megabytes (MB). The more
RAM you have, the more programs you can run simultaneously. 
 Synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM): Many ultrafast computers use
some form of SDRAM synchronized with a particular clock rate of a CPU
so that a processor can perform more instructions in a given time.
 Double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM): This is a type of SDRAM that
can dramatically improve the clock rate of a CPU.
 Auxiliary storage: This term refers to physical data-storage space on a
hard drive, tape, CD-RW, or other device.
54
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

 Virtual memory: This is a type of memory on your hard drive that your
computer can “borrow” to serve as extra RAM.
 Network interface card (NIC): You need this hardware add-on if you
have a cable or DSL modem or if you expect to connect your computer
to others on a network. Having a NIC usually provides you with Ethernet
data transfer to the other computers. (Ethernet is a network technology
that permits you to send and receive data at very fast speeds.)
The Internet is teeming with places where you can find good deals on hardware.
A great place to start is the CNET Shopper.com Web site (shopper.cnet.com).
Also visit the auction site uBid.com (www.ubid.com). 
Processor speed
Computer processors are getting faster all the time. Don’t be overly impressed
by a computer’s clock speed (measured in megahertz or even gigahertz). By
the time you get your computer home, another, faster chip will already have
hit the streets. Just make sure you have enough memory to run the types of
applications shown in Table 2-2. (Note that these are only estimates, based
on the Windows versions of these products that were available at the time of
this writing.)

The RAM recommended for the sample applications in Table 2-2 adds up to a
whopping 688MB. If you plan to work, be sure to get at least 512MB of RAM —
more if you can swing it. Memory is cheap nowadays, and the newer PCs will
allow you to install several GB (that’s gigabytes) of RAM.
55
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

Hard drive storage
Random access memory is only one type of memory your computer uses; the
other kind, hard drive, stores information, such as text files, audio files, pro-
grams, and the many essential files that your computer’s operating system
needs. Most of the new computers on the market come with hard drives that
store many gigabytes of data. Any hard drive with a few gigabytes of storage
space should be adequate for your business needs if you don’t do a lot of
graphics work. But most new computers come with hard drives that are 60GB
or larger in size.
CD-RW/DVD±RW drive
Although a DVD and/or CD recordable drive may not be the most important
part of your computer for business use, it can perform essential installation,
storage, and data communications functions, such as installing software and
saving and sharing data. A growing number of machines are now being made
available with a digital versatile disc (DVD) drive. You can fit 4.7GB or more
of data on a DVD±RW, compared with the 700MB or so that a conventional
CD-RW can handle. 
Be sure to protect your equipment against electrical problems that can result
in loss of data or substantial repair bills. At the very least, make sure that
your home office has grounded three-prong outlets and a surge suppressor. A
common variety is a five- or six-outlet strip that has a protection device built
in. Also consider the option of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which
keeps devices from shutting off immediately in the event of blackouts. The
PowerCard by Guardian On Board (www.guardian-ups.com) is available at
most computer retail outlets, and costs about $149.

Building an online presence: 
It’s an ongoing process
Judy Vorfeld, who is profiled in Chapter 6, needs
to update her computer hardware regularly even
though she works in the editorial field rather
than a more technically oriented profession. As
far as equipment goes, Judy estimates that each
year she spends about $800 to $1,000 on com-
puter hardware and $350 on software related to
her business. She has two networked desktop
computers, a Pentium 3 and Pentium 4, which
she upgrades as needed. She has a CD/DVD
burner on her main computer, and backs up her
files on DVDs. Her 6-lb. laptop, which she uses
whenever she travels, has a CD-RW/DVD-ROM
drive, and 256 MB of RAM. For software, she
uses the Web page editor Macromedia HomeSite
to create Web pages, Paint Shop Pro to work
with graphics, and Microsoft Word for most of
her book editing.

Monitor
In terms of your online business, the quality or thinness of your monitor
doesn’t affect the quality of your Web site directly. Even if you have a poor-
quality monitor, you can create a Web site that looks great to those who visit
you. The problem is that you won’t know how good your site really looks to
customers who have high-quality monitors. 
Flat-panel LCD (liquid crystal display) monitors continue to be a hot item,
and they’re becoming more affordable, too. You’ve got a real choice between
a traditional CRT (cathode-ray tube) monitor and a flat LCD. Whether you
choose flat or traditional, the quality of a monitor depends on several factors:
 Resolution: The resolution of a computer monitor refers to the number
of pixels it can display horizontally and vertically. A resolution of 640 x
480 means that the monitor can display 640 pixels across the screen
and 480 pixels down the screen. Higher resolutions, such as 800 x 600
or 1,024 x 768, make images look sharper but require more RAM in your
computer. Anything less than 640 x 480 is unusable these days.
 Size: Monitor size is measured diagonally, as with TVs. Sizes such as
14 inches, 15 inches, and up to 21 inches are available. (Look for a 
17-inch CRT monitor, which can display most Web pages fully, and
which is now available for less than $200.)
 Refresh rate: This is the number of times per second that a video card
redraws an image on-screen (at least 60 Hz [hertz] is preferable).
Keep in mind that lots of Web pages seem to have been designed with 17-inch
or 21-inch monitors in mind. The problem isn’t just that some users (especially
those with laptops) have 15-inch monitors, but you can never control how
wide the viewer’s browser window will be. The problem is illustrated in the
page from the Yale Style Manual, one of the classic references of Web site
design (www.webstyleguide.com).
Computer monitors display graphic information that consists of little units
called pixels. Each pixel appears on-screen as a small dot — so small that it’s
hard to perceive with the naked eye, unless you magnify an image to look at
details close up. Together, the patterns of pixels create different intensities of
light in an image, as well as ranges of color. A pixel can contain one or more
bytes of binary information. The more pixels per inch (ppi), the higher a
monitor’s potential resolution. The higher the resolution, the closer the image
appears to a continuous-tone image such as a photo. When you see a monitor’s
resolution described as 1,280 x 1,024, for example, that refers to the number of
pixels that the monitor can display. Dot pitch refers to the distance between any
two of the three pixels (one red, one green, and one blue) that a monitor uses to
display color. The lower the dot pitch, the better the image resolution that you
obtain. A dot pitch of 0.27 mm is a good measurement for a 17-inch monitor.
57
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

Fax equipment
A fax machine is an essential part of many home offices. If you don’t have the
funds available for a standalone machine, you can install software that helps
your computer send and receive faxes. You have three options: 
 You can install a fax modem, a hardware device that usually works with
fax software. The fax modem can be an internal or external device.
 You can use your regular modem but install software that enables your
computer to exchange faxes with another computer or fax machine.
 You can sign up for a service that receives your faxes and sends them to
your computer in the body of an e-mail message. (For more information,
see the “Fax Services” section of the Internet Directory on this book’s
Web site.)
I also recommend that you look into WinFax PRO by Symantec, Inc. (www.
symantec.com/winfax/index.html). Your Windows computer needs to be
equipped with a modem in order to send or receive faxes with WinFax.
If you plan to fax and access the Internet from your home office, you should
get a second phone line or a direct connection, such as DSL or cable modem.
The last thing a potential customer wants to hear is a busy signal.
Image capture devices
When you’re ready to move beyond the basic hardware and on to a frill, think
about obtaining a tool for capturing photographic images. (By capturing, I mean
digitizing an image or, in other words, saving it in computerized, digital format.)
Photos are often essential elements of business Web pages: They attract a
customer’s attention, they illustrate items for sale in a catalog, and they can
provide before-and-after samples of your work. If you’re an artist or designer,
having photographic representations of your work is vital.
Including a clear, sharp image on your Web site greatly increases your chances
of selling your product or service. You have two choices for digitizing: a scan-
ner or digital camera. To decide which, read on.
Digital camera
Not so long ago, digital cameras cost thousands of dollars. These days, you
can find a good digital camera made by a reputable manufacturer, such as
Nikon, Fuji, Canon, Olympus, or Kodak, for $275–$600. You have to make an
investment up front, but this particular tool can pay off for you in the long
run. With the addition of a color printer, you can even print your own photos,
which can save you a pile in photo lab costs.
58
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Don’t hesitate to fork over the extra dough to get a camera that gives you
good resolution. Cutting corners doesn’t pay when you end up with images
that look fuzzy, but you can find many low-cost devices with good features.
For example, the Canon PowerShot A20, which I spotted for $279, has a reso-
lution of more than 2 megapixels — fine enough to print on a color printer
and enlarge to a size such as 5 x 7 inches — and a zoom feature. Megapixels
are calculated by multiplying the number of pixels in an image — for instance,
when actually multiplied, 1,984 x 1,488 = 2,952,192 pixels or 2.9 megapixels.
The higher the resolution, the fewer photos your camera can store at any one
time because each image file requires more memory.
Online material is primarily intended to be displayed on computer monitors
(which have limited resolution), so having super-high resolution images isn’t
critical for Web pages. Before being displayed by Web browsers, images must
be compressed by using the GIF or JPEG formats. (See Chapter 5 for more scin-
tillating technical details on GIF and JPEG.) Also, smaller and simpler images
(as opposed to large, high-resolution graphics) generally appear more quickly
on the viewer’s screen. If you make your customers wait too long to see an
image, they’re apt to go to someone else’s online store.
When shopping for a digital camera, look for the following features:
 The ability to download images to your computer via a FireWire or USB
connection
 Bundled image-processing software
 The ability to download image files directly to a memory card that you
can easily transport to a computer’s memory card reader
 An included LCD screen that lets you see your images immediately

A low-budget alternative
If you only want to get a computerized version
of a photo on your Web without investing in any
of the hardware that I mention here, not to
worry. Just call your local photo shop or copy
center. Many Kinko’s Copies outlets, for exam-
ple, provide computer services that include
scanning photos. If you do your photo process-
ing through Kodak, you can have the images
placed online or on a CD. If you’re a member
of America Online, you can get your photos
online through a program called “You’ve Got
Pictures” and delivered to a location that you
set up with AOL.
Wherever you go, be sure to tell the technician
that you want the image to appear on the Web,
so it should be saved in GIF or JPEG format.
Also, if you have an idea of how big you want
the final image to be when it appears online, tell
that to the technician, too. The person can save
the image in the size that you want so you don’t
have to resize it later in a graphics program.

On the downside, because of optical filtering that’s intended to reduce color
artifacts — distortions of an image caused by limitations in hardware —
photos taken with digital cameras tend to be less sharp than conventional
35mm photos. Correcting this problem in a graphics program can be time
consuming. For high-quality close-ups on the cheap, try a scanner instead.
Digital photography is a fascinating and technical process, and you’ll do well to
read more about it in other books, such as Digital Photography All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by David Busch or Digital Photography For
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Julie Adair King (both by Wiley).
Scanners
Scanning is the process of turning the colors and shapes contained in a pho-
tographic print or slide into digital information (that is, bytes of data) that a
computer can understand. You place the image in a position where the scan-
ner’s camera can pass over it, and the scanner turns the image into a computer
document that consists of tiny bits of information called pixels. The type that
I find easiest to use is a flatbed scanner. You place the photo or other image
on a flat glass bed, just like what you find on a photocopier. An optical device
moves under the glass and scans the photo.
The best news about scanners is that they’ve been around for a while, which,
in the world of computing, means that prices are going down at the same time
that quality is on the rise. The bargain models are well under $100, and I’ve
even seen a couple priced as low as $49.95 after a rebate.
A type of scanner that has lots of benefits for small or home-based businesses
is a multifunction device. You can find these units, along with conventional
printers and scanners, at computer outlets. I have a multifunction device
myself, in my home office. It sends and receives faxes, scans images, acts as a
laser printer, and makes copies — plus it includes a telephone and answering
machine. Now, if it could just make a good cup of espresso. . . .
For more detail about scanners, check out Scanners For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Getting Online: Connection Options
After you purchase the computer hardware that you need, telephone bills are
likely to be the biggest monthly expense you’ll encounter in connection with
your online business. At least, they are for me: I pay for local service, long-
distance service, cell phone service, plus DSL service over my phone lines.
It pays to choose your telco (telephone company) connection wisely.
60
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

A second phone line
Having a second line is pretty much a given if you plan to do business online
regularly. A cell phone will work fine for business purposes if you don’t want
to pay your telephone company’s fees for the extra land line. Because you’ll
be using your modem to dial the same one or two access numbers provided
by your Internet service provider, confirm with your telco that your Internet
access number is local so you don’t end up paying long-distance fees.
Ask your telco about a call pack so you can call one number a lot for the
same rate: 100 calls per month for a flat $10 fee, for example.
Beyond dialup
The best way to connect to the Internet is through a direct line, which means
that, rather than be connected to the Internet for the length of your modem’s
phone call, you’re connected all the time. Besides freeing up a phone line, a
direct connection is typically light years faster than a dialup modem connec-
tion. Before you get your heart set on a high-speed Internet connection, check
to see whether these options are available in your area.
Cable modem
Cable modem connections offer a really attractive way to get a high-speed con-
nection to cyberspace. So go ahead and ask your local cable TV providers
whether they provide this service. Turmoil erupted when the largest cable
provider, @Home, ceased operations in early 2002. But other options, such
as AT&T Broadband Internet (www.attbroadband.com) and EarthLink
(www.earthlink.net/home/broadband/cable) provide high-speed Internet
access through affiliations with cable TV providers in many parts of the country.
In my neighborhood in Chicago, a company called RCN Chicago (rcnchicago.
com) offers Internet access via cable modem for $45.95 plus a $75 installation
fee that includes the cable modem device itself. AT&T Broadband Internet
(www.attbroadband.com), however, offers similar service for $39.95.
The advantages of having a cable modem connection are many: It’s a direct
connection, it frees up a phone line, and it’s super fast. Cable modems have
the capacity to deliver 4 or 5MB of data per second. In reality, of course, the
speed is going to be less than this because you’re sharing access with other
users. Plus, you have to purchase or lease the cable modem itself, pay an
installation fee, and purchase an Ethernet card (if your computer doesn’t
already have one installed). But a cable modem is going to be far faster than
a dialup connection.
61
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

You can find out which cable modem and DSL providers cover your area by
using the Service Availability tool provided by Cable-Modem.net (www.cable-
modem.net/gc/service_availability.html).
DSL
Wouldn’t it be great if you could use conventional telephone lines to connect
to the Internet all the time? Wouldn’t it be even better if the connection were
really fast — say, 100 times as fast as a 56 Kbps dialup modem?
If your telephone company offers its customers Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
connections, these aren’t just pie-in-the-sky questions. DSLs “borrow” the
part of your phone line that your voice doesn’t use, the part that transmits
signals of 3,000 Hz (hertz) or higher. DSLs can upload (send) data to another
location on the Internet at 1.088 Mbps (megabits per second), and download
(receive) data at more than twice that rate: 2.560 Mbps.
DSL comes in different varieties. Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)
transmits information at different speeds depending on whether you’re send-
ing or receiving data. Symmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) transmits
information at the same speed in both directions. As DSL gets more popular,
it becomes more widely available and the pricing drops. As I’m writing this,
EarthLink DSL is available for $49.95 per month with free DSL modem and
installation. Your local phone provider might offer DSL, too. In the Chicago
area, Ameritech has a DSL option for $49 per month plus $99 to purchase the
DSL modem.
Software Solutions for Online Business
One of the great things about starting an Internet business is that you get to
use Internet software. As you probably know, the programs you use online
are inexpensive (sometimes free), easy to use and install, and continually
being updated.
Although you probably already have a basic selection of software to help you
find information and communicate with others in cyberspace, the following
sections describe some programs you may not have as yet and that will come
in handy when you create your online business.
Don’t forget to update your insurance by sending your insurer a list of
new software (and hardware) or even by purchasing insurance specifically
for your computer-related items from a company such as Safeware (www.
safeware.com).
62
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Anyone who uses firewall or antivirus software will tell you how essential
these pieces of software are, for home or business use. Find out more about
such software in Chapter 7 or in my book Norton Internet Security For Dummies
(Wiley). See Chapter 17 for suggestions of accounting software — other impor-
tant software you’ll need.
Web browser
A Web browser is software that serves as a visual interface to the images,
colors, links, and other content contained on the Web. The most popular such
program is Microsoft Internet Explorer, with Netscape Navigator (part of the
Communicator suite) coming in a distant second place.
Your Web browser is your primary tool for conducting business online, just
as it is for everyday personal use. When it comes to running a virtual store or
consulting business, though, you have to run your software through a few
more paces than usual. You need your browser to
 Preview the Web pages you create
 Display frames, animations, movie clips, and other goodies you plan to
add online
 Support some level of Internet security, such as Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), if you plan to conduct secure transactions on your site
In addition to having an up-to-date browser with the latest features, installing
more than one kind of browser on your computer is a good idea. For example,
if you use Microsoft Internet Explorer because that’s what came with your
operating system, be sure to download the latest copy of Netscape Navigator,
as well. That way, you can test your site to make sure that it looks good to all
your visitors.
Web page editor
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a set of instructions used to format
text, images, and other Web page elements so that Web browsers can correctly
display them. But you don’t have to master HTML in order to create your own
Web pages. Plenty of programs called Web page editors are available to help
you format text, add images, make hyperlinks, and do all the fun assembly
steps necessary to make your Web site a winner.
63
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

In many cases, Web page editors come with electronic storefront packages;
QuickSite, which I discuss in Chapter 4, comes with Microsoft FrontPage
Express. Sometimes, programs that you use for one purpose can also help
you create Web documents: Microsoft Word has an add-on called Internet
Assistant that enables you to save text documents as HTML Web pages, and
Microsoft Office 98 and later (for the Mac) or Office 2000 or later (for Windows)
enables you to export files in Web page format automatically.
Taking e-mail a step higher
You’re probably very familiar with sending and receiving e-mail messages.
But when you start an online business, you should make sure that e-mail 
software has some advanced features:
 Autoresponders: Some programs automatically respond to e-mail
requests with a form letter or document of your choice.
 Mailing lists: With a well-organized address book (a feature that comes
with some e-mail programs), you can collect the e-mail addresses of visi-
tors or subscribers and send them a regular update of your business
activities or, better yet, an e-mail newsletter.
 Quoting: Almost all e-mail programs let you quote from a message to
which you’re replying, so you can respond easily to a series of questions.
 Attaching: Attaching a file to an e-mail message is a quick and convenient
way to transmit information from one person to another.
 Signature files: Make sure that your e-mail software automatically
includes a simple electronic signature at the end. Use this space to list
your company name, your title, and your Web site URL.
Both Outlook Express, the e-mail component of Microsoft Internet Explorer,
and Netscape Messenger, which is part of the Netscape Communicator suite
of programs, include most or all these features. Because these functions are
all essential aspects of providing good customer service, I discuss them in
more detail in Chapter 13.
Discussion group software
When your business site is up and running, consider taking it a step farther
by creating your own discussion area right on your Web site. This sort of 
discussion area isn’t a newsgroup as such; it doesn’t exist in Usenet, and
you don’t need newsgroup software to read and post messages. Rather, it’s a
Web-based discussion area where your visitors can compare notes and share
their passion for the products you sell or the area of service you provide.
64
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Programs such as Microsoft FrontPage enable you to set up a discussion area
on your Web site. See Chapter 13 for more information.
FTP software
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is one of those acronyms you see time and time
again as you move around the Internet. You may even have an FTP program
that your ISP gave you when you obtained your Internet account. But chances
are you don’t use it that often.
In case you haven’t used FTP yet, start dusting it off. When you create your
own Web pages, a simple, no-nonsense FTP program is the easiest way to
transfer them from your computer at home to your Web host. If you need to
correct and update your Web pages quickly (and you will), you’ll benefit by
having your FTP software ready and set up with your Web site address, user-
name, and password so that you can transfer files right away. See Chapter 3
for more about using File Transfer Protocol.
Image editors
You need a graphics-editing program either to create original artwork for
your Web pages or to crop and adjust your scanned images and digital pho-
tographs. In the case of adjusting or cropping photographic image files, the
software you need almost always comes bundled with the scanner or digital
camera, so you don’t need to buy separate software for that.
In the case of graphic images, the first question to ask yourself is, “Am I
really qualified to draw and make my own graphics?” If the answer is yes,
think shareware first. Three programs I like are Adobe Photoshop Elements
(www.adobe.com), LView Pro by Leonardo Haddad Loureiro (www.lview.com),
and Paint Shop Pro by Jasc, Inc. (www.jasc.com). You can download all these
programs from the Web to use on a trial basis. After the trial period is over,
you’ll need to pay a small fee to the developer in order to register and keep
the program. Photoshop Elements costs $99, LView Pro version 2001 costs
$40; Paint Shop Pro costs $119 to download for Version 9 or $129 for a boxed
version.
The ability to download and use free (and almost free) software from share-
ware archives and many other sites is one of the nicest things about the
Internet. Keep the system working by remembering to pay the shareware
fees to the nice folks who make their software available to individuals like
you and me.
65
Chapter 2: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business

Instant messaging
You may think that MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, and PalTalk
are just for social “chatting” online, but instant messaging has its business
applications, too. Here are a few suggestions:
 If individuals you work with all the time are hard to reach, you can use a
messaging program to tell you if those people are logged on to their com-
puters. This allows you to contact them the moment they sit down to work
(provided they don’t mind your greeting them so quickly, of course).
 You can cut down on long-distance phone charges by exchanging instant
messages with far-flung colleagues.
 With a microphone, sound card, and speakers, you can carry on voice
conversations through your messaging software.
MSN Messenger enables users to do file transfers without having to use FTP
software or attaching files to e-mail messages.
Backup software
Losing copies of your personal documents is one thing, but losing files related
to your business can hit you hard in the pocketbook. That makes it even more
important to make backups of your online business computer files. Iomega
Zip or Jaz drives (www.iomega.com) come with software that lets you auto-
matically make backups of your files. If you don’t own one of these programs,
I recommend you get really familiar with the backup program included with
Windows XP or look into Backup Exec by VERITAS Software Corporation
(www.veritas.com).

Selecting the Right Web Host 
and Design Tools
In This Chapter
 Choosing software to create and edit your Web pages
 Finding a Web page shortcut with a template
 Developing compelling content that attracts customers
 Selecting a hosting service for your Web site
 Transferring your Web site files to your hosting service
You can sell items online without having a Web site. But do you really
want to? Doing real online business without some sort of online “home
base” is time consuming and inefficient. The vast majority of online commer-
cial concerns use their Web sites as the primary way to attract customers,
convey their message, and make sales. A growing number of ambitious capi-
talists use online auction sites such as eBay (www.ebay.com) to make money,
but the auctioneers who depend on eBay for regular income often have their
own Web pages, too.
The success of a commercial Web site depends in large measure on two
important factors: Where it’s hosted and how it’s designed. These factors
affect how easily you can create and update your Web pages, what special
features such as multimedia or interactive forms you can have on your site,
and even how your site looks. Some hosting services provide Web page cre-
ation tools that are easy to use but that limit the level of sophistication you
can apply to the page’s design. Other services leave the creation and design
up to you. In this chapter, I provide an overview of your Web hosting options
as well as different design approaches that you can implement.
Plenty of Web sites and CD-ROMs claim that they can have your Web site up
and running online “in a matter of minutes” using a “seamless” process. The
actual construction may indeed be quick and smooth — as long as you’ve
done all your preparation work beforehand. This preparation work includes
identifying your goals for going online, deciding what market you want to reach,

deciding what products you want to sell, writing descriptions and capturing
images of those products, and so on. Before you jump over to Yahoo! Small
Business or Microsoft Small Business Center and start assembling your site,
be sure that you’ve done all the groundwork that I discuss in Chapter 2, such
as identifying your audience and setting up your hardware.
Getting the Most from Your Web Host
An Internet connection and a Web browser are all you need if you’re primarily
interested in surfing through cyberspace, consuming information, and shop-
ping for online goodies. But when you’re starting an online business, you’re
no longer just a consumer; you’re becoming a provider of information and
consumable goods. Along with a way to connect to the Internet, you need to
find a hosting service that will make your online business available to your
prospective customers.
A Web hosting service is the online world’s equivalent of a landlord. Just as
the owner of a building gives you office space or room for a storefront where
you can hang your shingle, a hosting service provides you with space online
where you can set up shop.
You can operate an online business without a Web site if you sell regularly on
eBay. But even on eBay, you can create an About Me page or an eBay store;
eBay itself is your host in both cases. (You pay a monthly fee to eBay in order
to host your store. See Chapter 10 for more information.)
A Web host provides space on special computers called Web servers that are
connected to the Internet all the time. Web servers are equipped with soft-
ware that makes your Web pages visible to people who connect to them by
using a Web browser. The process of using a Web hosting service for your
online business works roughly like this:
1. You decide where you want your site to appear on the Internet.
Do you want it to be part of a virtual shopping mall that includes many
other businesses? Or do you want a standalone site that has its own Web
address and doesn’t appear to be affiliated with any other organization?
2. You sign up with a Web host.
Sometimes you pay a fee. In some cases, no fee is required. In all cases,
you’re assigned space on a server. Your Web site gets an address, or URL,
that people can enter in their browsers to view your pages.
68
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

3. You create your Web pages.
Usually, you use a Web page editor to do this.
4. After creating content, adding images, and making your site look just
right, you transfer your Web page files (HTML documents, images, and
so on) from your computer to the host’s Web server.
You generally need special File Transfer Protocol (FTP) software to do
the transferring. But many Web hosts will help you through the process
by providing their own user-friendly software. (The most popular Web
editors, such as Macromedia Dreamweaver, will let you do this, too.)
5. You access your own site with your Web browser and check the con-
tents to make sure that all the images appear and that any hypertext
links you created go to the intended destinations.
At this point, you’re open for business — visitors can view your Web
pages by entering your Web address in their Web browser’s Go To or
Address box.
6. You market and promote your site to attract potential clients or 
customers.
Carefully choose a Web host because the host will affect which software you’ll
use to create your Web pages and get them online. The Web host also affects
the way your site looks, and it may determine the complexity of your Web
address. (See the “What’s in a name?” sidebar later in this chapter for details.)
If you have a direct connection to the Internet such as a DSL line and are
competent with computers (or if you have access to someone who is), you can
host your own site on the Web. However, turning your own computer into a
Web server is a lot more complicated than signing up with a hosting service.
(Your ISP may not allow you to set up your own server anyway; check your
user agreement first.) You need to install server software and set up a domain
name for your computer. You’ll also have to purchase a static IP address for
your machine. (An IP address is a number that identifies every computer
that’s connected to the Internet, and that consists of four sets of numerals
separated by dots, such as 206.207.99.1. A static IP address is one that doesn’t
change from session to session.) If you’re just starting a simple home-based
or part-time business, hosting your own Web site is probably more trouble
than you care to handle, but you should be aware that it’s an option. If you’re
interested in becoming a Webmaster, check out Speakeasy (www.speakeasy.
net). This ISP encourages users to set up their own Web servers, and even
offers two static IP address with a DSL line for $59.95 per month.

Finding a Web Server to Call Home
Hi! I’m your friendly World Wide Web real estate agent. Call me Virtual Larry.
You say you’re not sure exactly what kind of Web site is right for you, and you
want to see all the options, from a tiny storefront in a strip mall to your own
landscaped corporate park? Your wish is my command. Just hop into my
2005-model Internet Explorer, buckle your seat belt, and I’ll show you around
the many different business properties available in cyberspace.
Here’s a road map of our tour:
 Online Web-host-and-design-kit combos: Yahoo! Small Business
Merchant Solutions, Yahoo! GeoCities, and Microsoft Small Business
Center (formerly called bCentral), among others.
 America Online: My FTP Place and Hometown AOL.
 Electronic merchant CD-ROMs: ShopSite and WebSite Complete, to
name two.
 eBay: A site that lets its users create their own About Me Web pages and
their own stores.
 Auxiliary companies: These folks do something that doesn’t seem
directly related to e-commerce, but they let you build a store online, like
FedEx eCommerce Builder.
 An online shopping mall: You can rent a space in these virtual malls.
 Your current Internet service provider (ISP): Many ISPs are only too
happy to host your e-commerce site — for an extra monthly fee in addi-
tion to your access fee.
 Companies devoted to hosting Web sites full time: These are businesses
whose primary function is hosting e-commerce Web sites and providing
their clients with associated software, such as Web page building tools,
shopping carts, catalog builders, and the like.
The first four options combine Web hosting with Web page creation kits.
Whether you buy these services or get to use them on the Web for free, you
simply follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Most of these hosting services
enable you to create your Web pages by filling in forms; you never have to
see a line of HTML code if you don’t want to. Depending on which service
you choose, you have varying degrees of control over how your site ulti-
mately looks.
The last three options (ISPs, online malls, and full-time Web hosts) tend to be
do-it-yourself projects. You sign up with the host, you choose the software, and
you create your own site. However, the distinction between this category and
70
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

the others is blurry. As competition between Web hosts grows keener, more
and more companies are providing ready-made solutions that streamline the
process of Web site creation for their customers. For you, the end user, this is
a good thing: You have plenty of control over how your site comes into being
and how it grows over time.
If you simply need a basic Web site and don’t want a lot of choices, go with one
of the kits. Your site may look like everyone else’s and seem a little generic,
but setup is easy and you can concentrate on marketing and running your
business.
However, if you’re the independent type who wants to control your site and
have lots of room to grow, consider taking on a do-it-yourself project. The sky’s
the limit as far as the degree of creativity you can exercise and the amount of
sweat equity you can put in (as long as you don’t make your site so large and
complex that shoppers have a hard time finding anything, of course). The
more work you do, the greater your chances of seeing your business prosper.
71
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools
Web site homesteading for free
Free Web hosting is still possible for small busi-
nesses. If you’re on a tight budget and looking for
space on a Web server for free, turn first to your
ISP, which probably gives you server space to set
up a Web site. You can also check out one of a
handful of sites that provide customers with host-
ing space for no money down and no monthly
payments, either. Rather than money, you pay in
terms of advertising: You may have to look at
ads or other things, but if you don’t mind, here are
some good deals you can enjoy:
 Netfirms (www.netfirms.com): This site
places ads on your Web pages but gives
you 25MB of server space where you can
set up a business Web site for free and get
CGI processing for your forms, too. CGI
(Common Gateway Interface) provides a
way for a Web server to interact with an
application, such as a computer script, that
receives the information from a form and
processes it in a form that you can read
easily.
 Freeservers (www.freeservers.com):
In exchange for banner ads and popup ads,
which you are required to display if you set
up a Web site on one of its servers, and
Freeservers Special Offers, which are sent
to your e-mail address, this site gives you
several tools. You have the choice of two
free editors, add-ons (such as guest books
and hit counters), and an online Web page
building tool for creating your site — not to
mention 12MB of server space.
You can find more free Web hosting services on
Yahoo! here:
dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_
Economy/Business_to_Business/
Communications_and_Networking/
Internet_and_World_Wide_Web/

Web_Site_Hosting/Free_Hosting/
Be sure that the site you choose lets you set up
for-profit business sites for free.

Installing software to build a Web site
A new class of Web sites has caught on to the concept of making things easy
and affordable for would-be ontrepreneurs (online entrepreneurs). These sites
act as both a Web host and a Web page creation tool. You connect to the site,
sign up for service, and fill out a series of forms. Submitting the completed
forms activates a script on the host site that automatically generates your
Web pages based on the data you entered.
In this section, I show you how to set up a business Web site with Yahoo!
Store, a popular “kit” service. Many such sites are available, and investigating
all your options is always smart. Some other Web site creation packages are
available at the following sites:
 Yahoo! GeoCities (geocities.yahoo.com): Yahoo! GeoCities is a popu-
lar spot for individuals who want to create home pages and full-fledged
personal and business Web sites at a low cost. The site provides a free
hosting option that requires users to display ads on the sites they create.
If you want ad-free hosting, you can choose between GeoCities PLUS,
which offers extra storage for a $10 setup fee plus a $4.95 per month
hosting fee, or GeoCities PRO, which offers your own domain and e-mail
for a $15 setup fee plus $8.95 per month.
 AOL Hometown (hometown.aol.com): America Online hosts this Web
site where individuals can create their own Web pages for business or
personal use. A “neighborhood” within AOL Hometown, called Business
Park, is set aside for commercial sites, and an area within the Business
Park area hosts home-based businesses. (See the upcoming section,
“You’ve got business: Creating an AOL store,” for more information.)
Suppose you have some music CDs, photos, or artwork that can be printed
and sold on clothing. You’ve created the art or saved the photos as GIF or
JPEG image files, and you want to place them on products you can sell to
friends, family, or anyone who’s interested. A popular service called CafePress
(www.cafepress.com) makes it easy for you to create and sell such products
online for free. The hard part is deciding what you want to sell, how best to
describe your sales items, and how to promote your site. Getting your words
and images online is remarkably straightforward:
1. Connect to the Internet, start up your Web browser, and go to the
CafePress Free Store page (www.cafepress.com/cp/info/sell).
The Sell Stuff Online — Free Store page appears in your browser window.
2. Click the Start Selling Now button just beneath the introductory text.
The CafePress.com — Join page appears. Before creating a store, you
need to register with CafePress. 
72

3. Assign yourself a username and password (if you haven’t done so
already). When you’re done, click Join Now.
The New Member Survey page appears.
4. Fill out the survey, and click Let’s Start Selling!
The Open a Shop page appears.
5. Click Open a Basic Shop.
The Welcome to CafePress.com Basic Shops! page appears.
6. Under the Shop Information heading, enter a short ID that will be
included in your store’s URL and a name for your store. Fill out the
rest of the options on the page if necessary, and click Submit when
you’re done.
The Welcome to CafePress.com Basic Shops! page appears. Click the
URL supplied for your new store so you can see that, although it’s
empty, it really exists (see Figure 3-1).
7. Close the new browser window that opened so you could inspect your

Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

You’ve got business: Creating an AOL store
If you’re one of the millions of folks who already have an account with
America Online, it makes sense to consider setting up your online store with
AOL as your host. Even if you don’t have an account with AOL presently, you
may want to sign up in order to create and publish a simple Web site. Plenty
of entrepreneurs either started an online business with AOL and then moved
on to another Web host, or continue to maintain their business Web sites on
one of AOL’s Web servers.
When you sign up for an account with America Online, you’re entitled to 2MB
of space for your own Web pages. That may not seem like a lot of room, but
consider that the average Web page is only 5 to 10K in size. Even if each page
contains images that are perhaps 10 to 20K in size, which still means you have
room for 70 to 100 Web pages. Besides that, an account with AOL provides
for seven separate usernames. Each username is entitled to 2MB of Web site
space. In theory, at least, you have 14MB of space at your disposal. This is
more than enough to accommodate most moderately sized Web sites.
If AOL is so great, why doesn’t everyone publish Web sites with it? Well, AOL
has its downsides, too. For one thing, its servers seem (to me, at least) to be
noticeably slower than others, perhaps because of the sheer volume of users.
AOL has had problems with members being unable to get online during busy
times. And unless you pay AOL’s flat monthly rate for unlimited access, you’re
liable to run up some sizable hourly access charges in the course of creating,
revising, and maintaining your business site. Finally, there’s a subtle but
important difference between AOL and a Web host that’s on the Internet:
Even though it has its own Web sites, AOL isn’t really part of the Internet. It’s
on its own online network. E-mail sent from an AOL user to someone on the
Internet has to go through a computer connection called a gateway. If the
gateway goes down or if some other aspect of AOL’s operation experiences a
problem, all AOL users are suddenly inaccessible from the Internet. Your
business may be inaccessible to many potential customers for a time.
Although AOL does seem to be getting more reliable, the fact that it’s sepa-
rate from the Internet is an important consideration to keep in mind if you’re
thinking about setting up shop there.
America Online presents several resources for customers who want to pub-
lish Web pages for their business or personal use. Some of these resources
are accessible only through America Online, but because AOL is making an
effort to branch out onto the Web itself, other resources are located on the
Web, not within AOL.
Collectively, the AOL Web page publishing options are known as My Place or
My FTP Space, as shown in Figure 3-4.
76
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Within My FTP Space, you can find plenty of resources, including
 1-2-3 Publish: This is a service that performs roughly the same function
as the Web page generators provided by Yahoo! GeoCities, CNET WebSite
Builder, or Yahoo! Store. You fill out a form by using your AOL browser.
The information on the form is presented in the form of a very rudimen-
tary Web page. The information requested is personal, however, and not
intended for business use. (AOL Keyword: 1-2-3 Publish.)
 Easy Designer: This is AOL’s graphic Web page design tool for publish-
ing sites on AOL Hometown (which I discuss in a later bullet). It lets you
create and preview your own pages without having to master HTML.
Versions are available for both Windows and Macintosh users.
 Other Web page editors: AOL also provides links to clip art shareware
and commercial Web editors that you can download and use to create
your business site.
 My FTP Space: This is the service that transfers Web pages you have
already made to your directory on one of AOL’s servers with FTP (File
Transfer Protocol). My FTP Place doesn’t create your Web pages for you,
but you can use any Web page authoring tool to do that. (AOL Keyword:
My FTP Space.)
Figure 3-4:

and AOL

resources

Web sites.
77
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

 AOL Hometown: After you publish your Web site on AOL by using My
FTP Space, you can add the site to the AOL online community on the
Web. AOL Hometown (hometown.aol.com) is a “real” Web site on the
Internet: It’s not part of AOL’s own domain the way My Place is. AOL
Hometown is open to America Online members and other Internet users
alike. AOL members who go through the extra effort of including their
sites on AOL Hometown get double exposure: Their sites are accessible
both within AOL (through My FTP Space) and on the Web itself (through
AOL Hometown).
If you’re an AOL customer and you want to start a home-based business for
virtually nothing, you have two options: My FTP Space or AOL Hometown.
Which one is best? AOL Hometown gives you more space (either 4MB or 12MB,
depending on how many files you keep online). Getting your files online is
also easier with AOL Hometown. With My FTP Space, you create the pages by
using one of the AOL Web page tools or another Web editor. You then upload
the files, following the instructions in the My FTP Space Help files. But if you
use one of the AOL Web page creation tools (1-2-3 Publish or Easy Designer)
to create your site, you can upload the files from within the same program.
To set up your site at AOL Hometown by using 1-2-3 Publish, follow these steps:
1. Create a new screen name.
The first step is to pick a screen name for your site. This doesn’t need to
be the same as your usual AOL username. AOL lets you use as many as
seven different screen names, and I recommend reserving one for your
personal use and one for your business site. To create a new screen name,
connect to AOL by using your master screen name, enter the keyword
Names, and then follow the instructions for creating a new screen name.
Your choice of screen name is important when you use My FTP Space as
your Web site host. The screen name appears as part of your Web site
URL. For example, if your business is called WidgetWorld, you might
choose the screen name widgets. When you transfer your files online by
using My FTP Place, you and your visitors can then access your site by
using the URL members.aol.com/widgets. 
2. Go to hometown.aol.com/hmtwn123 and start using 1-2-3 Publish by
clicking the Your First Home Page link. (AOL Keyword: 1-2-3 Publish).
The Welcome page, entitled Get a Free Page in Minutes!, appears. A
number of predesigned page templates appear on this page.
You don’t have to be using AOL software to use 1-2-3 Publish; you don’t
even have to be an AOL subscriber. If you’re not a subscriber, you do
have to sign up for a screen name, but it’s free to do so. Go to hometown.
aol.com to find out more.
78
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

3. Click My Business Page to begin designing your Web page.
The My Business Page Template page appears.
4. Choose a color and background for your page, and assign a name to the
page by filling out this page’s form; then click the Save this Page button.
A preview of your page appears.
5. If you want to make changes, click Modify. When you’re satisfied with
your page’s appearance, click Done.
When you click Done, a page appears with the message Congratulations —
You’ve Got a Home Page! and a link to the site that you just created.
6. Click the link to view your new Web site.
It’s as easy as that. If you ever want to edit your page, click the Edit My Page
link that appears above any AOL Hometown page.
You don’t have to use 1-2-3 Publish to create a Web site, but it’s a great tool
for beginners. More experienced users can create a complete Web site by
using a Web editor. After you’ve completed your pages, go to AOL Hometown
and click the Create link that appears above any page on the site. You’ll go to a
page entitled Create or Edit Pages. Click Upload to move your already created
files to AOL Hometown, or click Add to add your pages to an AOL Hometown
site that you’ve previously created.
Investigating electronic storefront software
All the other options that this chapter provides for publishing your business
site are ones that you access and utilize online. Yet another option for creat-
ing a business site and publishing it online is to purchase an application that
carries you through the entire process of creating an electronic storefront. The
advantage is control: You own and operate the software and are in charge of
the entire process (at least until the files get to the remote Web servers). The
speed with which you develop a site depends on how quickly you master the
process, not on the speed of your Internet connection. 
Like hosting services such as Yahoo! Store, Tripod, and CNET WebBuilder,
electronic storefront software is designed to facilitate the process of creating
Web pages and to shield you from having to master HTML. Most storefront
software provides you with predesigned Web pages, called templates, which
you customize for your particular business. Some types of electronic store-
front options go a step or two beyond the other options by providing you
with shopping cart systems that enable customers to select items and tally
the cost at checkout. They may also provide for some sort of electronic pay-
ment option, such as credit card purchases.
79
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

Usually, you purchase the software on floppy disk or CD-ROM, install the
package like any other application, and follow a series of steps that detail
the primary aspects of a business:
 The storefront: The Web pages that you create. Some packages, such as
WebSite Complete, include predesigned Web pages that you can copy
and customize with your own content.
 The inventory: You can stock your virtual storefront shelves by present-
ing your wares in the form of an online catalog or product list.
 The delivery truck: Some storefront packages streamline the process of
transferring your files from your computer to the server. Instead of using
FTP software, you publish information simply by clicking a button in your
Web editor or Web browser.
 The checkout counter: Most electronic storefront packages give you the
option to accept orders by phone, fax, or online with a credit card.
Besides providing you with all the software that you need to create Web
pages and get them online, electronic storefronts instruct you on how to
market your site and present your goods and services in a positive way. In
addition, some programs provide you with a backroom for your business,
where you can record customer information, orders, and fulfillment.
The problem with many electronic storefront packages is that they’re very
expensive — some cost $5,000 to $10,000 or more. They’re not intended for
individuals starting their own small businesses, but rather for large corpora-
tions that want to branch out to the Web. However, a few packages (two of
which I describe in the following sections) provide a Ford-type alternative to
the Rolls-Royce storefronts.
ShopSite
ShopSite, by ShopSite, Inc., isn’t software that you purchase and install on
your computer. Rather, you find a Web hosting service that runs ShopSite on
its servers. You then set up an account with the host and use the ShopSite
software over the Internet, using your Web browser. This kind of setup, which
is called a hosted application, means you don’t have to worry about having
enough memory or hard drive space to run the program yourself. You also
don’t have to bother with updating or troubleshooting the software; that, too,
is the hosting service’s responsibility.
In order to find a hosting service that runs ShopSite, you go to the ShopSite
Web site (www.shopsite.com) and scan a list of hosts. You pick a company
and arrange for an account. Pricing varies depending on the host and the ver-
sion of the service that you want. ShopSite comes in three varieties:
80
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

 Starter: Lets you create a catalog of only 15 items for sale and 5 Web pages.
 Manager: Gives you an unlimited number of pages, plus templates,
themes, a shopping cart, and real-time credit card processing.
 Pro: Adds the ability to track inventory as products are purchased.
One host I saw was offering ShopSite Starter for $49 with its hosting packages,
the Manager version for $74 per month, and the Pro version for $125 per month.
Instead of renting the software on a monthly basis, you can also buy a life-
time license. I saw ShopSite Lite advertised for $135, Manager for $495, and
Pro for $1,295.
ecBuilder Pro
ecBuilder Pro, by Maximizer Software, Inc. (www.ecbuilder.com), is soft-
ware that you purchase and install on your computer. You either download
the program from its own Web site for $379 or purchase it on a CD-ROM for
$399. The software makes it easy for you to create not only basic Web pages,
but to also make a site searchable by keyword, to set up password-protected
pages, and to set up a shopping cart.
If ecBuilder Pro seems expensive, you can sign up with a host that includes
the software among the services it gives you for a monthly fee. Easyhosting
(www.easyhosting.com) includes ecBuilder’s shopping cart software with
its Standard to Intermediate hosting packages, which range from $29.99 to
$79.99 per month.
ecBuilder Pro comes with 40 templates and interactive wizards for creating
Web sites; it works with Windows 95 or later.
Moving into an online mall
In addition to Web site kits, Internet service providers, and businesses that
specialize in Web hosting, online shopping malls provide another form of
Web hosting. You set up your site, either on your own or using special Web
page authoring utilities that some malls provide. You pay a monthly fee, you
transfer your files to the mall’s Web site, and your store appears online. The
basic steps are the same with an online mall as with any of the other hosting
businesses that I mention in this chapter.
What’s the difference, then, between a shopping mall that does Web hosting,
an Internet service provider that does hosting, and a Web hosting service?
Their names and the features they offer differ slightly, but the important thing
to remember is that they all do essentially the same thing. After you open
your virtual business on the Web, your customers can’t always tell whether
you’re part of America Online, a mall, or a Web host such as EarthLink.
81
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

What is an online shopping mall, anyway? It’s a collection of online businesses
that are listed in a directory or index provided by a single organization. The
directory may be a simple list of stores on a single Web page. For larger malls
with a thousand stores or more, the online businesses are arranged by cat-
egory and can be found in a searchable index.
82
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 
Finding a host that makes your business dynamic
Whether you choose America Online or another
ISP, which Web host you choose can have a big
impact on how easy it is to get online and run your
business successfully. Just ask Doug Laughter.
He and his wife Kristy own The Silver Connection,
LLC, which sells sterling silver jewelry imported
from India, Asia, and Mexico. They began their
endeavor when Kristy brought back some silver
jewelry from Mexico. The Silver Connection
went online in April 1998 at www.silver
connection.comand is hosted by CrystalTech
Web Hosting, Inc. (www.crystaltech.com).
Q. Why did you choose CrystalTech as your
Web host?
A. CrystalTech is my second Web host. I didn’t
have any problems with my previous host, but the
issue of changing Web hosts came down to the
Web development technology I wanted to choose
for my site. I settled on CrystalTech because it
supported the Web Application Server that I
chose, which was a Windows platform running
Internet Information Server. I also wanted to use
Microsoft Access or Microsoft SQL Server for
my database solution to support the develop-
ment of Active Server Pages (ASP).
Q. What makes CrystalTech such a good Web
host?
A. What makes CrystalTech particularly good is
that it gives its clients access to a Control Center
that allows complete administrative control for the
domain. Included in this are mail, FTP, and Domain
Name System with automatic ODBC (Open Data-
base Connectivity) for databases. A client also
gets access to several utilities that analyze traffic
to your Web site. I also use the comprehensive
knowledge base and online forums that carry on
discussions about programming, Web site design,
databases, networking, and other topics.
Q.What kinds of customer service features do you
use that other business owners should look for?
A. One feature that CrystalTech is very good with
is notification. If Web hosting or mail services will
be offline for a certain amount of time, I receive
an e-mail in advance specifying exactly what is
going to happen and when. I have always been
treated very well by tech support when I have
needed to call.
Q. What kinds of questions should small busi-
ness owners and managers ask when they’re
shopping around for a hosting service? What
kinds of features should they be looking for 
initially?
A.I would first suggest considering how you want
to develop your Web site. Today’s e-commerce
site needs to be dynamic in nature, so the busi-
ness needs to research and determine what
Web server application it will use. A Web server
application consists of the following:
 Server Side Technology: Active Server
Pages, ColdFusion, Java Server Pages, PHP
 Database Solution: Microsoft SQL Server,
MS Access, MySQL, Oracle
 Server Application: IIS, Apache, iPlanet,
Netscape Enterprise
 Operating Platform: Windows, UNIX

In theory, an online shopping mall helps small businesses by giving them
additional exposure. A customer who shops at one of the mall’s stores might
notice other businesses on the same site and visit it, too. Some malls function
as Web hosts that enable their customers to transfer Web page files and pre-
sent their stores online, using one of the mall’s Web servers. Other malls let
people list their business in the mall with a hyperlink, even if the store is
actually hosted by another company.
Perhaps the only thing that really distinguishes online malls from other host-
ing services is presentation:
 Some malls, such as Downtown Anywhere (www.awa.com), use the
metaphor of a town square to organize their businesses. Stores are 
presented as being on particular streets; visitors browse the shops as
though walking around the streets of a small town.
 Another online mall to look into is Microsoft bCentral Small Business
Directory (sbd.bcentral.com), which gathers in one location a number
of small businesses that are hosted by Microsoft Small Business Services.
Microsoft, like its rival Yahoo! Small Business, no longer lets you test its
Web page creation system for free. You must now pay a monthly fee to
locate your business with the site permanently. 
Consider joining an online mall if you find one that offers an attractive host-
ing package, particularly if it has Web page forms that will help you set up
your site or create an online catalog quickly. But remember that to Web shop-
pers it doesn’t matter who your host is; what’s more important is that you
develop compelling content for your site to attract customers and encourage
sales.
83
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools
So the decision on how the e-commerce Web
site will be developed and in what technology is
a very key decision to make from the onset. Once
this is decided, choose a Web host that supports
your Web server application of choice.
Q. After the development platform is determined,
what features should you look for?
A. Look for dedicated disk space for database
applications. 250MB or 500MB of disk space
might be fine for your Web site files, but throw in
a highly developed Microsoft SQL Server rela-
tional database management system, and you’ll
be paying for some additional space.
Also ask about how much data transfer you can
do in a given period, how many e-mail addresses
are given with the domain, and whether there’s
an application that lets you control and admin-
ister your entire Web site. If you don’t have your
own shopping cart application, ask your host
what it offers in this area. Specifically, find out
what application it offers, how transactions are
completed, and how credit card purchases
are processed. Finally, make sure there’s an
application that can analyze traffic, such as
WebTrends or SmarterStats, or Media House
Services.

Amazon.com doesn’t look like an online mall, but it has instituted some oppor-
tunities for entrepreneurs to sell items on its site. If you don’t want to create
an entire storefront, you also have the option of selling items individually on
the Amazon.com site. You pay fees to list items for sale and for completed sales
as well. Find out more by going to the Amazon.com home page (www.amazon.
com) and clicking the Sell Your Stuff link near the top of the page.
Turning to your ISP for Web hosting
People sometimes talk about Internet service providers (ISPs) and Web hosts
as two separate types of Internet businesses, but that’s not necessarily the
case. Providing users with access to the Internet and hosting Web sites are
two different functions, to be sure, but they may well be performed by the
same organization.
In fact, it’s only natural to turn to your own ISP first to ask about its Web host-
ing policies for its customers. Like John Raddatz (see the section Chapter 15),
if you already go online with AOL, trying out its Web hosting facilities makes
sense. If you have an Internet access account with the popular ISP EarthLink
(www.earthlink.net), by all means, consider EarthLink as a Web host for
your business site.
EarthLink has different Web hosting options depending on the kind of account
you have. Like most ISPs, however, EarthLink provides Web space to its cus-
tomers so that they can publish Web pages that are primarily personal in
nature. Yes, you can publish a business Web site, and EarthLink won’t complain
or cancel your account. But it really suggests that business users “spring” for
special business services that include oodles of Web space, support for forms
and CGI scripts, and a “vanity” URL of the www.company.com variety.
EarthLink offers a StarterSite package ($19.95 per month plus $25 setup fee),
which provides individual users with the following Web hosting options:
 200MB of storage space
 30 separate e-mail accounts for personal or family members’ use
 Free CGI scripts that you can run to capture information submitted in a
Web page form to either an e-mail message or a file that you can read
 Site Builder, the EarthLink Web page editing tool
 Urchin, a reporting service that analyzes traffic to your site
 The ability to create Web blogs
 A Web page URL that takes the form www.earthlink.com/~username
84
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

What should you look for in an ISP Web hosting account, and what constitutes
a good deal? For one thing, price: A rate of $19.95 per month for unlimited
access and 50 to 100MB (or even 200MB with StarterSite) of Web site space
is a pretty good deal. Look for a host that doesn’t limit the number of Web
pages that you can create. Also find one that gives you at least one e-mail
address with your account and that lets you add extra addresses for a nomi-
nal fee. Finally, look for a host that gives you the ability to include Web page
forms on your site so that visitors can send you feedback.
What to expect from an ISP Web hosting service
The process of setting up a Web site varies from ISP to ISP. Here are some
general features that you should look for, based on my experience with my
own ISP:
 Web page editor: You don’t necessarily need to choose a provider that
gives you a free Web page editor. You can easily download and install the
editor of your choice. I tend to use one of two programs, either Microsoft
FrontPage or Macromedia Dreamweaver, to create Web pages. (I describe
both programs later in this chapter.)
 Password and username: When my Web pages are ready to go online,
I get to use the same username and password to access my Web site
space that I use when I dial up to connect to the Internet. Although you
don’t need to enter a password to view a Web site through a browser
(well, at least at most sites), you do need a password to protect your
site from being accessed with an FTP program. Otherwise, anyone can
enter your Web space and tamper with your files.
 FTP software: When I signed up for a hosting account, I received a CD-ROM
containing a basic set of software programs, including a Web browser
and an FTP program. FTP is the simplest and easiest-to-use software to
transfer files from one location to another on the Internet. When I access
my Web site space from my Macintosh, I use an FTP program called Fetch.
From my PC, I use a program called WS-FTP. Cute FTP (www.cuteftp.com)
is another program that many Web site owners use, which costs $39.95.
Most FTP programs are available for free on the Internet or can be pur-
chased for a nominal fee.
 URL: When you set up a Web site by using your ISP, you’re assigned a
directory on a Web server. The convention for naming this directory is
~username. The ~username designation goes at the end of your URL for
your Web site’s home page. However, you can (and should) register a
shorter URL with a domain name registrar, such as Network Solutions.
You can then “point” the domain name to your ISP’s server so that it can
serve as an “alias” URL for your site. 
85
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

After you have your software tools together and have a user directory on
your ISP’s Web server, it’s time to put your Web site together. Basically, when
I want to create or revise content for my Web site, I open the page in my Web
page editor, make the changes, save the changes, and then transfer the files
to my ISP’s directory with my FTP program. Finally, I review the changes in
my browser.
What’s the ISP difference?
What’s the big difference between using a kit, such as Yahoo! Small Business,
to create your site and using your own inexpensive or free software to create
a site from scratch and post it on your ISP’s server? It’s the difference between
putting together a model airplane from a kit and designing the airplane your-
self. If you use a kit, you save time and trouble; your plane ends up looking
pretty much like everyone else’s, but you get the job done faster. If you design
it yourself, you have absolute control. Your plane can look just the way you
want. It takes longer to get to the end product, but you can be sure you get
what you wanted.
On the other hand, three differences lie between an ISP-hosted site and a site
that resides with a company that does only Web hosting, rather than provides
Internet dialup access and other services:
 A business that does only Web hosting charges you for hosting services,
whereas your ISP may not.
 A Web hosting service lets you have your own domain name (www.
company.com), whereas an ISP may not. (Some ISPs require that you
upgrade to a business hosting account in order to obtain the vanity
address. See the “What’s in a name?” sidebar for more about how Web
hosting services offer an advantage in the domain-name game.)
 A Web hosting service often provides lots of frills, such as super-fast
connections, one-button file transfers with Web editors such as Microsoft
FrontPage, and tons of site statistics, as well as automatic backups of your
Web page files.
To find out more about using a real, full-time Web hosting service, see the
section, “Going for the works with a Web hosting service,” later in this chapter.
Where to find an ISP
What if you don’t already have an Internet service provider, or you’re not
happy with the one you have? On today’s Internet, you can’t swing a mouse
without hitting an ISP. How do you find the one that’s right for you? In general,
you want to look for the provider that offers you the least expensive service
with the fastest connection and the best options available for your Web site.
86
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Bigger doesn’t necessarily mean cheaper or better; many regional or local
ISPs provide good service at rates that are comparable to the giants such as
Verio or EarthLink. When you’re shopping around for an ISP, be sure to ask
the following types of questions:
 What types of connections do you offer?
 How many dialup numbers do you have?
 What is your access range? (Do you provide only local coverage, or
regional or international coverage as well?)
 What type of tech support do you offer? Do you accept phone calls or
e-mail inquiries around the clock or only during certain hours? Are real
human beings always available on call or are clients sent to a phone
message system?
Some Web sites are well known for listing ISPs by state or by the services
they offer. Here are a few good starting points in your search for the ideal ISP:
 The List: This site lists about 8,000 ISPs. You can search the list by area
code or by country code, or you can focus on the United States or Canada.
thelist.internet.com
 Yahoo’s List of Internet Access Providers: This is a good source for
directories of national and international ISPs.

Going for the works with a 
Web hosting service
After you’ve had your site online for a while with a free Web host, such as AOL
(which is free if you have an AOL account) or Yahoo! GeoCities, you may well
decide that you need more room, more services (such as Web site statistics),
and a faster connection that can handle many visitors at one time. In that case,
you want to locate your online business with a full-time Web hosting service.
As the preceding sections attest, many kinds of businesses now host Web
sites. But in this case, I’m defining Web hosting service as a company whose
primary mission is to provide space on Web servers for individual, nonprofit,
and commercial Web sites.
87
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

What to look for in a Web host
Along with providing lots of space for your HTML, image, and other files 
(typically, you get anywhere from 50 to 500MB of space), Web hosting serv-
ices offer a variety of related services, including some or all the following:
 E-mail addresses: You’re likely to be able to get several e-mail addresses
for your own or your family members’ personal use. Besides that, many
Web hosts give you special e-mail addresses called auto-responders. These
are e-mail addresses, such as info@yourcompany.com, that you can set
up to automatically return a text message or a file to anyone looking for
information.
 Domain names: Virtually all the hosting options that I mention in this
chapter give customers the option of obtaining a short domain name,
such as www.mycompany.com. But some Web hosts simplify the process
by providing domain-name registration in their flat monthly rates.
 Web page software: Some hosting services include Web page authoring/
editing software, such as Microsoft FrontPage. Some Web hosting services
even offer Web page forms that you can fill out online in order to create
your own online shopping catalog. All you have to provide is a scanned
image of the item you want to sell, along with a price and a description.
You submit the information to the Web host, who then adds the item to
an online catalog that’s part of your site.
 Multimedia/CGI scripts: One big thing that sets Web hosting services
apart from other hosts is the ability to serve complex and memory-
intensive content, such as RealAudio sound files or RealVideo video clips.
They also let you process Web page forms that you include on your site by
executing computer programs called CGI scripts. These programs receive
the data that someone sends you (such as a customer service request or
an order form) and present the data in readable form, such as a text file,
e-mail message, or an entry in a database. See Chapter 6 for more about
how to set up and use forms and other interactive Web site features.
 Shopping cart software: If part of your reason for going online is to sell
specific items, look for a Web host that can streamline the process for
you. Most organizations provide you with Web page forms that you can
fill out to create sale items and offer them in an online shopping cart, for
example.
 Automatic data backups: Some hosting services automatically back up
your Web site data to protect you against data loss — an especially useful
feature because disaster recovery is important. The automatic nature of
the backups frees you from the worry and trouble of doing it manually.
88
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

 Site statistics: Virtually all Web hosting services also provide you with
site statistics that give you an idea (perhaps not a precisely accurate
count, but a good estimate) of how many visitors you have received.
Even better is access to software reports that analyze and graphically
report where your visitors are from, how they found you, which pages
on your site are the most frequently viewed, and so on.
 Shopping and electronic commerce features: If you plan to give your
customers the ability to order and purchase your goods or services
online by using their credit cards, be sure to look for a Web host that
provides you with secure commerce options. A secure server is a com-
puter that can encrypt sensitive data (such as credit card numbers)
that the customer sends to your site. For a more detailed discussion of
secure electronic commerce, see Chapter 7.
Having so many hosting options available is the proverbial blessing and
curse. It’s good that you have so many possibilities and that the competition
is so fierce because that can keep prices down. On the other hand, deciding
which host is best for you can be difficult. In addition to asking about the pre-
ceding list of features, here are a few more questions to ask prospective Web
hosts about their services to help narrow the field:
 Do you limit file transfers? Many services charge a monthly rate for a
specific amount of electronic data that is transferred to and from your
site. Each time a visitor views a page, that user is actually downloading a
few kilobytes of data in order to view it. If your Web pages contain, say,
1MB of text and images and you get 1,000 visitors per month, your site
accounts for 1GB of data transfer per month. If your host allocates you
less than 1GB per month, it will probably charge you extra for the amount
you go over the limit.
 What kind of connection do you have? Your site’s Web page content
appears more quickly in Web browser windows if your server has a
super-fast T1 or T3 connection. Ask your ISP what kind of connection it
has to the Internet. If you have a DSL line, speeds differ depending on
the ISP: You might get a fast 1.5MBps connection or a more common
684Kbps connection. Make sure you’re getting the fastest connection
you can afford.
 Will you promote my site? Some hosting services (particularly online
shopping malls) help publicize your site by listing you with Internet
search indexes and search services so that visitors are more likely to
find you.
89
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

Besides these, the other obvious questions that you would ask of any con-
tractor apply to Web hosting services as well. These include questions like:
“How long have you been in business?” and “Can you suggest customers who
will give me a reference?”
The fact that I include a screen shot of a particular Web hosting service’s site
in this chapter or elsewhere in this book doesn’t mean that I’m endorsing or
recommending that particular organization. Shop around carefully and find
the one that’s best for you. Check out the hosts with the best rates and most
reliable service. Visit some other sites that they host and e-mail the owners
of those sites for their opinion of their hosting service.
Competition is tough among hosting services, which means that prices are
going down. But it also means that hosting services may seem to promise the
moon in order to get your business. Be sure to read the fine print and talk to
the host before you sign a contract, and always get statements about techni-
cal support and backups in writing.
What’s it gonna cost?
Because of the ongoing competition in the industry, prices for Web hosting
services vary widely. If you look in the classified sections in the back of maga-
zines that cover the Web or the whole Internet, you’ll see adds for hosting
services costing from $9.95 to $24.95 per month. Chances are, these prices
are for a basic level of service: Web space, e-mail addresses, domain name,
and software. This may be all you need.
90
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 
What’s in a name?
Most hosts assign you a URL that leads to your
directory (or folder) on the Web server. For exam-
ple, my account with my ISP includes space on
a Web server where I can store my Web pages,
and the address looks like this:
http://homepage.xo.com/~gholden
This is a common form of URL that many Web
hosts use. It means that my Web pages reside in
a directory called ~gholden on a computer
named homepage. The computer, in turn,
resides in my provider’s domain on the Internet:
xo.com.
However, for an extra fee, some Web hosts allow
you to choose a shorter domain name, provided
that the one you want to use isn’t already taken
by another site. For example, if I’d paid extra for
a full-fledged business site, my provider would
have let me have a catchier, more memorable
address, like this:
www.gregholden.com

The second level of service provides CGI script processing, the ability to
serve audio and video files on your site, regular backups, and extensive site
statistics, as well as consultants who can help you design and configure your
site. This more sophisticated range of features typically runs from $20 per
month up to $100 or more per month. At Hosting.com, for instance, you can
conduct secure electronic commerce on your site as part of hosting packages
that cost between $19.95 and $99.95 per month. MySQL database support
starts at $59 per month.
Fun with Tools: Choosing 
a Web Page Editor
A woodworker has his or her favorite hammer and saw. A cook has an array of
utensils and pots and pans. Likewise, a Web site creator has software programs
that facilitate the presentation of words, colors, images, and multimedia in
Web browsers.
A little HTML is a good thing — but just a little. Knowing HTML comes in handy
when you need to add elements that Web page editors don’t handle. Some
programs, for example, don’t provide you with easy buttons or menu options
for adding <META> tags, which enable you to add keywords or descriptions to
a site so that search engines can find them and describe your site correctly.
If you really want to get into HTML or to find out more about creating Web
pages, read HTML 4 For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed Tittel and Natanya Pitts,
or Creating Web Pages For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Bud Smith and Arthur
Bebak (both by Wiley).
It pays to spend time choosing a Web page editor that has the right qualities.
What qualities should you look for in a Web page tool, and how do you know
which tool is right for you? To help narrow the field, I’ve divided this class of
software into different levels of sophistication. Pick the type of program that
best fits your technical skill.
For the novice: Use your existing programs
A growing number of word processing, graphics, and business programs are
adding HTML to their list of capabilities. You may already have one of these
programs at your disposal. By using a program with which you’re already
comfortable, you can avoid having to install a Web page editor.
91
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

Here are some programs that enable you to generate one type of content and
then give you the option of outputting that content in HTML, which means
that your words or figures can appear on a Web page:
 Microsoft Word: The most recent versions of the venerable word pro-
cessing standby work pretty much seamlessly with Web page content.
You can open Web pages from within Word and save Word files in Web
page format.
 Adobe PageMaker/Quark Xpress: The most recent versions of these
two popular page layout programs let you save the contents of a docu-
ment as HTML — only the words and images are transferred to the
Web, however; any special typefaces become generic Web standard
headings.
 Microsoft Office XP or 2003: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all give users
the option of exporting content to Web pages.
 WordPerfect and Presentations 12: These two component programs
within Corel’s suite of tools let you save files as an HTML page or a PDF
file that you can present on the Web. If you have chosen to present one
slide per Web page, the program adds clickable arrows to each slide in
your presentation so that viewers can skip from one slide to another.
Although these solutions are convenient, they probably won’t completely
eliminate the need to use a Web page editor. Odds are, you’ll still need to make
corrections and do special formatting after you convert your text to HTML.
For intermediate needs: User-friendly 
Web editors
If you’re an experienced Web surfer and eager to try out a simple Web editor,
try a program that lets you focus on your site’s HTML and textual content,
provides you with plenty of functionality, and is still easy to use. Here are
some user-friendly programs that are inexpensive (or, better yet, free), yet
allow you to create a functional Web site.
The following programs don’t include some of the bells and whistles you
need to create complex, interactive forms, format a page using frames, or
access a database of information from one of your Web pages. These goodies
are served up by Web page editors that have a higher level of functionality,
which I describe in the upcoming section for advanced commerce sites.
92
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

BBEdit
If you work on a Macintosh and you’re primarily concerned with textual con-
tent, BBEdit is one of the best choices you can make for a Web page tool. It
lives up to its motto: “It doesn’t suck.” BBEdit is tailored to use the Mac’s
highly visual interface, and version 8 will run on the Mac OS 10.3.5 or later.
You can use Macintosh drag and drop to add an image file to a Web page
in progress by dragging the image’s icon into the main BBEdit window, for
example. Find out more about BBEdit at the Bare Bones Software, Inc. Web
site (www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html).
Other good choices of Web editors for the Macintosh are Taco HTML Edit
by Taco Software (www.tacosw.com) or PageSpinner by Optima System
(www.optima-system.com).
Macromedia HomeSite
HomeSite is an affordable tool for Web site designers who feel at ease work-
ing with HTML code. However, HomeSite isn’t just an HTML code editor. It
provides a visual interface so that you can work with graphics and preview
your pages layout. HomeSite also provides you with step-by-step utilities
called wizards to quickly create pages, tables, frames, and JavaScript ele-
ments. A version of HomeSite is bundled with Macromedia Dreamweaver MX
2004, the latest version of the Dreamweaver Web site editor. HomeSite is also
available as a standalone program that works with Windows 98 or later; find
out more about it at www.macromedia.com/software/homesite.
Microsoft FrontPage Express
Microsoft doesn’t support FrontPage Express anymore, but if you still use
Windows 98 and you’re on a tight budget, give it a try. The software comes
bundled with Windows 98 and you don’t have to do a thing to install it. Just
choose Start➪Programs➪Internet Explorer➪FrontPage Express to open
FrontPage Express.
CoffeeCup HTML Editor
CoffeeCup HTML Editor, by CoffeeCup Software (www.coffeecup.com), is a
popular Windows Web site editor that contains a lot of features for a small
price ($49). You can begin typing and formatting text by using the CoffeeCup
HTML Editor menu options. You can add an image by clicking the Insert
Image toolbar button, or use the Forms toolbar to create the text boxes and
radio buttons that make up an interactive Web page form. You can even add
JavaScript effects and choose from a selection of clip art images that come
with the software.
93
Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools

CoffeeCup HTML Editor doesn’t let you explore database connectivity,
add Web components, or other bonuses that come with a program like
FrontPage or Dreamweaver. But it does have everything you need to create
a basic Web page.
Netscape Composer
When I read reviews of Web page software, I don’t often see Netscape Composer
included in the list. But to me, it’s an ideal program for an entrepreneur on a
budget. Why? Let me spell it out for you: F-R-E-E.
Netscape Composer is the Web page editing and authoring tool that comes
with Netscape 7.2 as well as earlier versions. All you have to do is download
one of these packages from the Netscape Browser Central page (channels.
netscape.com/ns/browsers/default.jsp), and Composer is automatically
installed on your computer along with Navigator (the Netscape Web browser)
and several other Internet programs.
With Composer, you can create sophisticated layout elements, such as tables
(which I discuss further in Chapter 5), with an easy-to-use graphical interface.
After you edit a page, you can preview it in Navigator with the click of a button.
Plus, you can publish all your files by choosing a single menu item. If you
already have Navigator installed, check out Composer right now!
For advanced commerce sites: 
Programs that do it all
If you plan to do a great deal of business online, or even to add the title of
Web designer to your list of talents (as some of the entrepreneurs profiled
in this book have done), it makes sense to spend some money up front and
use a Web page tool that can do everything you want — today and for years
to come.
The advanced programs that I describe here go beyond the simple designation
of Web page editors. They not only let you edit Web pages but also help you
add interactivity to your site, link dynamically updated databases to your
site, and keep track of how your site is organized and updated. Some pro-
grams (notably, FrontPage) can even transfer your Web documents to your
Web host with a single menu option. This way, you get to concentrate on the
fun part of running an online business — meeting people, taking orders, pro-
cessing payments, and the like.
94
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Macromedia Dreamweaver
What’s that you say? You can never hear enough bells and whistles? The 
cutting edge is where you love to walk? Then Dreamweaver, a Web authoring
tool by Macromedia (www.macromedia.com), is for you. Dreamweaver is a
feature-rich, professional piece of software.
Dreamweaver’s strengths aren’t so much in the basic features such as making
selected text bold, italic, or a different size; rather, Dreamweaver excels in
producing Dynamic HTML (which makes Web pages more interactive through
scripts) and HTML style sheets. Dreamweaver has ample FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) settings, and it gives you the option of seeing the HTML codes you’re
working within one window and the formatting of your Web page within a
second, WYSIWYG window. The latest version, Dreamweaver MX 2004, is a com-
plex and powerful piece of software. It lets you create Active Server pages,
connect to the ColdFusion database, and contains lots of templates and wiz-
ards. Dreamweaver is available for both Windows and Macintosh computers;
find out more at the Macromedia Web site (www.macromedia.com/software/
dreamweaver).

Chapter 3: Selecting the Right Web Host and Design Tools
Editors that’ll flip your whizzy-wig
Web browsers are multilingual; they understand
exotic-sounding languages such as FTP, HTTP,
and GIF, among others. But one language
browsers don’t speak is English. Browsers don’t
understand instructions such as “Put that image
there” or “Make that text italic.” HyperText
Markup Language, or HTML, is a translator, if
you will, between human languages and Web
languages.
If the thought of HTML strikes fear into your
heart, relax. Thanks to modern Web page cre-
ation tools, you don’t have to master HTML in
order to create Web pages. Although knowing
a little HTML does come in handy at times, you
can depend on these special user-friendly tools
to do almost all your English-to-HTML transla-
tions for you.
The secret of these Web page creation tools is
their WYSIWYG (pronounced whizzy-wig) display.
WYSIWYG stands for “What You See Is What
You Get.” A WYSIWYG editor lets you see on-
screen how your page will look when it’s on the
Web, rather than force you to type (or even see)
HTML commands like this:
<H1> This is a Level 1 Heading
</H1>
<IMG SRC = “lucy.gif”> <BR>
<P>This is an image of
Lucy.</P>
A WYSIWYG editor, such as CoffeeCup HTML
Editor for Windows (www.coffeecup.com),
shows you how the page appears even as you
assemble it. Besides that, it lets you format text
and add images by means of familiar software
shortcuts such as menus and buttons.

Microsoft FrontPage
FrontPage (www.microsoft.com/frontpage) is a powerful Web authoring
tool that has some unique e-commerce capabilities. For one thing, it provides
you with a way to organize a Web site visually. The main FrontPage window is
divided into two sections. On the left, you see the Web page on which you’re
currently working. On the right, you see a treelike map of all the pages on your
site, arranged visually to show which pages are connected to each other by
hyperlinks.
Another nice thing about FrontPage — something that you’re sure to find
helpful if you haven’t been surfing the Web or working with Web pages for
very long — is the addition of wizards and templates. The FrontPage wizards
enable you to create a discussion area on your site where your visitors can post
messages to one another. The wizards also help you connect to a database or
design a page with frames. (See Chapter 5 for more about creating frames.)
If you want to create an e-commerce Web site hosted by Microsoft Small
Business Center, you can download and install an auxiliary program FrontPage
calls an add-in that enables you to create a sales catalog and upload the files
to bCentral, all from within FrontPage.
Adobe GoLive
GoLive, a highly popular Web page tool by Adobe Systems Incorporated
(www.adobe.com/products/golive/main.html), is an especially good
choice if you want to exert a high level of control over how your Web page
looks. It helps you make use of the latest HTML style-sheet commands that
precisely control the positioning of text and images on a page.
GoLive (which is available in versions for Windows 2000 and XP and for the
Macintosh OS X versions 10.2.4 through 10.3) is especially well integrated
with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, two popular and sophisticated graph-
ics programs. Like Dreamweaver, GoLive supports server technologies such
as ASP, JSP, and PHP, which enable you to create active, dynamic Web sites.
You can even create Web pages that are especially formatted for wireless
devices, such as PDAs and Web-enabled cell phones.

W
hen you open up shop on the Internet, you don’t just begin to operate
in isolation. The whole point of the Internet is interconnection. That
plays out for businesses just as it does for individuals. Whether you realize it
or not, you’re not alone. You have access to thousands, even millions, of other
businesses that are in the same situation you are — or that went through the
same kinds of uncertainties you’re encountering before they achieved success.
The fact that you’re online means that you enjoy advantages over businesses
operating solely in the brick-and-mortar marketplace. You can overcome the
usual limitations of time and geography that previously would have limited
how many potential customers you could actually reach. You can communi-
cate using tools such as e-mail and blogging that don’t have a counterpart in
the offline world. Finally, you have access to services such as search engines
that can help you find suppliers and do business research and marketing.
This chapter provides you with a user friendly overview of the many new
opportunities available to you when you start an online business, including
tools, services, and opportunities for partnering so that you can advertise
your new endeavor in ways that help you break through to success without
breaking your budget.

Advantages of Doing Business Online
Sometimes, the key to success is simply being aware of all the opportunities
that are available to you. The worst reason you can have for going online is a
blind “everybody’s doing it” mindset. Instead of focusing narrowly on one
way of advertising or selling, take stock of all the aspects of online business
that you can exploit. Then when you create your Web site, select a payment
option, or set up security measures as described in succeeding chapters, and
you’ll do things right the first time around. The sections that follow describe
some advantages you need to make part of your business plan.
Operating 24/7
One of the first reasons why entrepreneurs flocked to the Web was the ability
to do business around the clock with customers across the globe. It still
applies today: It may be 2 a.m. in your local time zone, but someone can still
be making a purchase in London or Paris from your Web site or eBay Store
across the globe where it’s bright and early in the morning.
If you’re just starting out and you’re trying to reach the widest possible audi-
ence of consumers for your goods or services, be sure they are
 Small: That means they’re easy to pack and easy to ship.
 Something that people need and can use worldwide: DVDs, CDs, com-
puter products, action figures, and sports memorabilia will appeal
to many.
 Something that people can’t find in their local area: Many sites resell
gourmet foodstuffs from their home region that can’t easily be found
overseas, for example.
Make sure that you appeal to a small, niche segment of individuals around the
world. The things that tend to sell best online are things that people love and
are passionate about — specialty items like gourmet foods, rare beers and
wines, hard-to-find movies, old toys, and anything sold as a “limited edition.”
See the section on marketing to a worldwide audience in Chapter 15 for sug-
gestions on how to reach overseas consumers in their own languages, and
how to observe trade rules and restrictions that may apply.
98
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

If you do sell DVDs online, be aware that DVD players are required to include
codes that prevent the playback of DVDs in geographical regions where movies
have not been released to video as yet. A disc purchased in one country might
not play on a player purchased in another country. You need to pay attention
to the codes assigned to the DVDs you sell so your customers will actually be
able to play them.
Communicating with new tools
Nothing beats e-mail, in my opinion, for reaching customers in a timely and
friendly way. I know all about the immediacy of talking to people over the
phone. But phone calls can be intrusive, and most consumers are wary of
anyone who wants to market to them with an unsolicited phone call that inter-
rupts their daily activities. E-mail messages can come in at any time of the day
or night, but they don’t necessarily interrupt what the customers are doing.
And if customers have already made a purchase from your company, they
might welcome a follow-up contact by e-mail. And customers have the luxury
of being able to respond to you at their own convenience. Not only that, but
e-mail messages can contain links to products and services on your Web site,
and even entire newsletters that inform whoppers of new product offerings.
One of the most popular online communications systems, Instant Messaging
(IM), is useful for keeping in touch with business partners and co-workers.
But it can be the kiss of death for approaching current or potential customers.
Consumers are used to dropping everything to answer instant messages from
friends. When they discover that it’s a marketing message, they are going to
be turned off and downright hostile.
Besides e-mail newsletters, what kinds of communications strategies work
with online shoppers? The sections that follow give a few suggestions.
Giving away a free sample
I was in the grocery store the other day, looking at a hunk of cheese that cost
$13.99 a pound, and wishing I could open up the package and taste-test that
expensive curd before I plunked down the big bucks for it. The concept of
the “free sample” is one that Web surfers love. Newspapers like the Chicago
Tribune do it by making the first paragraph or two of archived articles avail-
able online; if you want to read the rest, you are asked to pay a nominal fee.
Amazon.com makes brief excerpts of selected CD tracks available on its Web
site so shoppers can listen to the music before deciding whether or not to
buy the CD.
99
Chapter 4: Exploiting New Ways to Build Business

On the Internet, software producers have been giving away free samples for
many years in the form of computer shareware: software programs that users
can download and use for a specified period of time. After the time period
expires, the consumers are asked (or required, if the program ceases to func-
tion) to pay a shareware fee if they want to keep the program. A tiny Texas
company called id Software started giving away a stripped-down computer
game on the Internet back in 1993, in the hope of getting users hooked on it
so they would pay for the full-featured version. The plan worked, and since
then more than 100,000 customers have paid as much as $40 for a full copy of
the game, which is called Doom. id Software has gone on to create and sell
many other popular games since.
Giving out discounts
One reason shoppers turn to the Internet is to save money. Thanks to sites
such as Amazon.com, which routinely knock money off the list price of books
and other media, shoppers are used to expecting some sort of discount from
the Internet. They’ll love it if you offer special “Internet only” prices on your
Web site, or give them coupons to print out and take to your store, like the
coupon provided by the tiny basement music store Schoolkids Records in
Exile in Ann Arbor, Michigan (see Figure 4-1).

Giving customers the chance to talk back
The ability to interact with customers and give them the opportunity to
actively participate in the way a company manufactures and markets its
products is a relatively new and exciting trend. One company that’s been
putting customers in charge for many years is Timbuk2, the manufacturer of
those tricolored bicycle shoulder bags you’ve probably seen around town.
When I wrote an article about Timbuk2 a few years ago, the company let me
design my own bag, which they shipped to me in a matter of a couple of days.
You, too, can pick out colors, logos, and special features like cell phone hold-
ers for your shoulder bags through the company’s Build Your Own Bag fea-
ture (www.timbuk2.com/tb2/byob.t2). As shown in Figure 4-2, you tell the
company exactly what you want; you confirm the price; you pay online; and
the bag is manufactured for you immediately on the factory floor.
A shoe designer named John Fluevog is doing the same thing as Timbuk2,
only with footwear. He offers “open source footwear” through his entertaining
Web site (www.fluevog.com/files/os-1.html). You pick the style and
colors, send the form to Fluevog, and he manufactures the one-of-a-kind
shoes just for you.

sporting apparel manufacturer Nike isn’t exactly a small business, but it’s
taken a leading position in building community among its customers. Every
week a live chat session is held for Nike customers. Discussion boards are also
available; the site (www.nikechat.com) boasts more than 33,000 registered
members and a total of 3.5 million messages posted.
Chat doesn’t make sense unless you have a solid user base of at least several
hundred regular users who feel passionately about your goods and services
and are dedicated enough to want to type real-time messages to one another
and to you. However, discussion groups are practical, even for small busi-
nesses; you can set them up with a discussion area through Microsoft
FrontPage or on Yahoo! (groups.yahoo.com). Find out more about making
your Web site more interactive in Chapter 6.
Taking advantage of micropayments’
rebirth
Credit card payments make the Web a viable place for e-commerce. But the
cost of the typical credit card transaction makes payments of less than $1
pointless. The popular payment service PayPal (www.paypal.com) charges
2.9 percent plus a 30-cent fee for each sale, which makes it impractical for
content providers to sell something for, say, 20 or 30 cents. Such small trans-
actions are known as micropayments. In the early dot-com days, the term
“micropayment” was thrown around quite a bit, both by writers like me and
by companies hoping they could induce Web surfers to pay small amounts
of money for bits of online content. Many of those companies failed to find
success and disappeared, in part because the process of setting up micro-
payments was cumbersome and highly technical.
Today, micropayment systems are attempting a comeback. A large percentage
of Web surfers have high-speed broadband connections and are used to paying
for content online. A system called BitPass brings small payments to more than
100 Web sites. There’s much more content online, including articles, music
clips, and cartoons, that could only be sold for small amounts of money. If
your business involves text, music, art, or other kinds of content, you may be
able to make a few cents for your work by using one of the following payment
services:
 Peppercoin: This company (www.peppercoin.com) tackles the problem
of credit card transaction costs by allowing customers to combine a
number of small payments before the card is charged. The company
says that for a 99-cent transaction, its fees amount to 10 cents or less.
102
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

 Yaga: This company (www.yaga.com) handles micropayments such as
the $2.50 or so that Tribune Company and Time.com charge for archived
articles. It also provides for aggregation of payments, and specializes in
splitting payments among copyright holders, merchants, and affiliates.
 PaymentOne: This company (www.paymentone.com) has relationships
with more than 1,400 Local Exchange Carriers (LECs). This enables the
company to let consumers charge small online purchases to their phone
bills through its PhoneBill product.
 RedPaper.com: This company (www.redpaper.com) lets content pro-
viders sell prose, poetry, and essays online for as little as a few cents each.
If you can link your Web site, eBay Store, or other venues to your offerings on
these micropayment sites, you begin to achieve synergy: your various sales
sites point to one another and build attention for your overall sales efforts.
Auctioning off your professional services
There’s nothing new about making a living selling your design, consultation,
or other professional services. But the Internet provides you with new and
innovative ways to get the word out about your products and services. Along
with having your own Web site in which you describe your experience, pro-
vide samples of your work, and make references to clients you’ve helped, you
can find new clients by auctioning off your services in what’s known as a reverse
auction. In a reverse auction, the provider of goods or services doesn’t initiate
a transaction — rather, the customer does.
A reverse auction site called Elance Online (go to www.elance.com and click
Elance Online) enables professional contractors to offer their services and
bid on jobs. The site is ideal if you don’t offer bits of content, such as stories
or articles, but usually charge by the hour or by the job for your services.
In this case, the customer is typically a company that needs design, writing,
construction, or technical work. The company posts a description of the job
on the Elance site. Essentially, it’s a Request for Bids or Request for Proposals:
Freelancers who have already registered with the site then make bids on the
job. The company’s purchasing officer can then choose the lowest bid, or
choose another company based on its qualifications.
It’s free for organizations that have jobs to offer to post their projects online.
However, contractors have to subscribe in order to be listed on the site and
bid on those projects. You have to pay an 8.75 percent fee to Elance if you are
chosen to perform a job. The least expensive package that enables you to bid
on projects for which you are qualified, the Enhanced Listing package, cost
$12 to $30 per month depending on the type of work you do. Find out more at

Exploring New Products and 
Services You Can Sell
E-commerce works when merchants give customers a choice. You provide
information about you and your products that allows shoppers to find out
more. Hopefully, they’ll make the ultimate choice to purchase something from
you, but that depends on choices you have made beforehand. The choices
you make when you first get started in e-commerce have an impact on the
success with which you reach your targeted customers. One of the main
choices is determining what you plan to sell online. Because you have made
the decision to sell on the Internet, chances are good that you’re a technology-
savvy businessperson. You’re open to new technologies and new ways of 
selling. The twenty-first century has seen an explosion in products and ser-
vices that were unheard of just a decade or so ago. If you can take advantages
of one of these opportunities, you increase your potential customer base.
Providing music files and 
other creative work
Today’s online customers are quite sophisticated about shopping online. You
can make your music or audio clips available online from your Web site. The
easiest option is to use your computer or a digital tape recorder to make the
recording and save the file in .wav (Waveform Audio Format), MP3, .ram
(RealAudio), or .wma (Windows Media Audio). Chances are excellent that
your visitors have one or more media players that can process and play at
least one of these types of files.
The rock group Wilco (which hails from my own town, Chicago) helped revolu-
tionize the way music is sold online. When Wilco’s album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot
was rejected by their big-time record company (oddly enough, the supposedly
media-savvy AOL Time Warner), the group’s members took matters into their
own hands and decided to sell the record on their Web site (www.wilcoworld.
net). They also made a number of songs available online for free. Eventually,
they signed with an independent record label. The fact that they made the
record available online started a “buzz” for it, and this valuable word-of-
mouth traffic made the album one of the best-selling albums of 2003. Since
then, many other groups have decided to make their music available online.
The biggest success story, in terms of getting music online, is of course
Apple’s marketplace iTunes (www.apple.com/itunes). Groups like Wilco
routinely provide links to their albums on the iTunes music site, where you
can download each track separately for 99 cents each. But if you’re just start-
ing out in the biz, you can digitize your audio files and post them online so
others can download them.

Groceries and other household services
Small, easily shipped merchandise like golf balls or tools are undeniably well
suited to online sales. But your online business doesn’t need to be restricted
to such items. Even perishable items like foodstuffs can be and frequently are
purchased online. Initially, the field attracted pure plays — companies such as
Webvan that devoted their sales activities solely to the Internet. They failed
to compete with brick-and-mortar stores.
The good news is that traditional brick-and-mortar grocery stores are finding
success by marketing their products on the Web as a way of supplementing
their traditional retail sales. Independent food producers such as Schwan’s
(www.schwans.com), based in Marshall, Minnesota, are now able to deliver
in their local area to customers who order on their Web sites. Other food
providers, such as FamilyChef.com (www.familychef.com, as shown in
Figure 4-3) deliver nationwide via FedEx.
The Food Marketing Institute (www.fmi.org) has studied why shoppers
decide to buy groceries online; the study showed that the main reasons are
 Cost savings
 Convenience
 Greater product variety

If you are able to offer food items that consumers can’t find elsewhere, and
at a competitive price, you should consider selling food online. People hate
negotiating parking lots and waiting in long lines at the checkout counters of
traditional supermarkets. People who live alone and who have difficulty get-
ting out (such as the elderly or sick) naturally turn to buying their groceries
online.
Are you interested in reaching online grocery shoppers online? A paper by
the online journal First Monday (www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue7_9/
kempiak) examines the rise, fall, and rise of the online grocery industry and
provides tips on what consumers are looking for when they pick out groceries
with their keyboard and mouse. Also check out the Food Marketing Institute’s
report “The e-Tail Experience: What Grocery Shoppers Think about Online
Shopping 2000 – Executive Summary” at www.fmi.org/e_business/etail
experience.htm.
Exploring m-commerce
The needs and habits of consumers drive what sells best online. These
days, consumers are going online in many more ways than just sitting at a
computer — that is, they’re branching out from e-commerce to m-commerce
(mobile commerce). Consumers are using their cell phones, PDAs, and pocket
computers to connect to cyberspace. Retailers are hungry to reach these
“wired” prospects any way they can; here are just two examples:
 Cell phone ring tones: I get a very negative reaction when I receive
unsolicited ads over my cell phone. What kinds of selling do work online?
Here’s an example: When I first got my spiffy new Web-enabled Nokia 6820
cell phone, I thought it would be fun to get some gimmicks for the kids
(at least, I told them the gimmicks were for them; they were for me, too).
I went online and downloaded a ring tone that was available on my phone,
and I later purchased a game that could be played on my phone as well.
 Photos and graphics: I did a search around my own cell phone’s version
of the Web (mMode, the online network provided by the merger of AT&T
and Cingular Wireless) and discovered that the main items you can pur-
chase are games to play on your cell phone and ring tones that your cell
phone can emit. Some hunting within the Games & Ring Tones category
uncovered a group of graphic images from Wallpaper Universe by a
mobile content provider called FunMail (www.funmail.com). If you can
draw some simple graphics and format them by using Wireless Markup
Language (WML) or a development tool such as the Java 2 Platform,
Micro Edition (J2ME) you, too, can create content for the growing cell
phone and hand-held market.
106
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

Online Content and Commentary
Plenty of traditional publications have discovered that they can supplement
home delivery and newsstand sales by providing some parts of their content
online on a subscription-only basis. Typically, some of the content is avail-
able for free, while other stories are designated as premium content that are
made available only to subscribers who have paid to subscribe to the site
and enter a valid username and password. The online versions of the Wall
Street Journal (www.wsj.com) and New York Times (www.nytimes.com) both
have premium content that is available only to paying subscribers.
Technically, it’s not as difficult as you may think to make some content on your
Web site publicly available and some content restricted only to those who have
a username and password. Most Web server software enables Webmasters to
designate certain directories as password protected and others as freely
available. If you’re technically savvy and decide to operate your own Web
server, you can use the open-source application Apache to password-protect
some parts of your Web site. The tricky part is not in restricting the content
but in creating the system that enables buyers to assign themselves usernames
and passwords and pay for their subscriptions in the first place. It’s best to
hire a Web designer or sign up with an e-commerce hosting service with sup-
port staff that can lead you through the process of setting up such systems.
Blogging to build your brand
People have been speaking their minds for fun and profit for as long as there
have been media to broadcast their words. Think about comedians like Will
Rogers, Richard Prior, and Lenny Bruce. What would they have done in the
age of the Internet? They would have started their own blogs, that’s what.
A Web log (blog for short) is a type of online journal or diary that can be fre-
quently updated. Blogs can be about anything in particular or nothing at all:
You can blog about your daily activities or travels and let your family and
friends know what you’ve been up to lately, or you can get your views and
opinions out in the world and develop a community of like-minded readers.
Many blogs consist of commentary by individuals who gather news items or
cool Web pages and make them available to their friends (or strangers who
happen upon their blogs). This, in fact, was the original idea behind blogs,
and the concept followed by many of the most popular ones: highlighting
little-known Web sites or articles or stores in the media that readers are too
busy to read, and providing alternative views and commentary about those
Web sites, news stories, or other current events.
107
Chapter 4: Exploiting New Ways to Build Business

Is it really possible to make a living by blogging? It is certainly possible to
supplement one’s income this way. Andrew Sullivan, who writes Daily Dish
(www.andrewsullivan.com), one of the most popular blogs around, reported
on his site that he was getting as many as 300,000 visitors each day in the days
leading up to the presidential election of 2004, when dedicated readers like me
were flocking to politically oriented blogs to get opinion and analysis. After
the election, visits went down, but they still hit 100,000 a day. And Sullivan
could proclaim in his blog that ad revenue from an advertising service that
specializes in blogs, Blogads (www.blogads.com), was making it possible for
him to continue.
An early blogger named Rebecca Blood has written a useful history of
Weblogs at www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html. The
Blogads FAQ (www.blogads.com/publisher_html) says that bloggers who
participate in the Blogads network make an average of $50 per month in ad
revenue, and some even clear as much as $5,000 per month. A Los Angeles
blogger named Matt Welch gets specific about his earnings on his site
(www.mattwelch.com/archives/week_2004_01_25.html#2396). Over a
10-month period, he had an average of 5,560 weekly visitors to his blog, and
earned a total over that period of $407.66.
Finding your niche
Blogging, like anything on the Web, works when you identify a niche group
and target that group by providing those people with content (or goods, or
services) that they are likely to want. The challenge is finding something to
say and putting time and energy into saying it on a regular basis. Although I
have set up my own blog at www.gregholden.com, I find it difficult to devote
the time and commitment for daily contributions. Yet, the most successful
blogs seem to be ones that are created by people who are used to writing
something every day, such as journalists. Academic faculty members who
are published and well regarded in their fields also run popular blogs.
What do you feel strongly about? What do you know well? Is there something
you would love to communicate and discuss every day? If so, that’s what you
should use to organize your blog. A blog can be about anything you like —
and I mean anything. A prime example: The Appliance Blog in which an appli-
ance repairman in Springfield, Oregon, provides a daily diary of his service
calls and repairs. Along the way, he provides links to the Web sites of major
appliance manufacturers as well as a forum where you can ask questions about
your own appliance problems. The repairman’s blog isn’t a place where you
can find out what he had for breakfast or what he thinks about world peace;
it’s focused solely on what he knows, and it’s a useful resource for anyone
who is having a problem with an appliance.
108
Part I: Strategies and Tools for Your Online Business 

One of the best-known blogs was the one created by an Iraqi citizen who went
by the pseudonym Salam Pax. His blog — Where is Rael? — provided a com-
pelling account of daily life in Iraq in 2002 and 2003, during the U.S. military’s
campaign to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein.
How, exactly, do you start a blog? Most people sign up for an account with an
online service that streamlines the process. Some of the best known are
 LiveJournal (www.livejournal.com)
 Movable Type (www.movabletype.org)
 Blogger (www.blogger.com)
 Typepad (www.typepad.com)
Two of these services are in fact related. Movable Type works by providing
bloggers with a computer script written in the Perl programming language.
You need to copy and install the script on the Web server that hosts the site
on which you want to publish the blog. If this process is too technical for you
(it probably is, unless you run your own Web server) you can do one of two
things: Pay Movable Type $40 to install the software for you, or pay a monthly
fee to TypePad, which is Movable Type’s paid service provider.
Just a few years ago, you had to be a programmer to figure out how to create
a blog on your Web page. But a number of services are available online to
streamline the process for nonprogrammers like you and me. Blogger (www.
blogger.com) lets you create your own blog for free, so it’s a good place to
start. Google owns Blogger, so the site enables you to participate in Google’s
AdWords program (see Chapter 14) as well so you might gain some revenue
from your blog. As with any Web-based content, you should do some planning
beforehand and write down some notes, such as
 A name for your blog
 What you want to talk about
 Some ideas for your first blog
Then follow these steps:
1. Start up your Web browser, go to the Blogger home page (www.
blogger.com), and click Create Your Blog Now.
The Create Blogger Account page appears.
2. Fill out the form with a username, password, and e-mail address; read
the terms of service; select the Acceptance of Terms check box; and
click Continue.
The Name Your Blog page appears.
109
Chapter 4: Exploiting New Ways to Build Business

3. Come up with a short name for your blog; add that blog to the URL
supplied and click Continue.
For instance, if your blog is called ToolTime, your URL should be
tooltime.blogspot.com.
The Choose a Template page appears.
4. Click the button beneath the graphic design (or template) you want to

A page appears with a light bulb icon and the notice Creating Your Blog. . .
After a few seconds, a page appears with the notice Your Blog Has Been
Created!.
5. Click Start Posting.
A page appears in which you type a title for your first posting and then
type the posting itself (see Figure 4-4).
6. Click the Publish Post button at the bottom of the page.
Your blog post is published online. That’s all there is to it!

Blogs that are odd, quirky, based on dramatic human-interest situations
such as wartime journals, or that are politically oriented tend to be the
most successful. That said, here are some ways to build up an audience for
your blog:
 Writing for other bloggers: Your first audience will probably consist of
family or friends, or other bloggers who live in the same geographic area
or write about the same subjects you do. Contact those bloggers and ask
them to exchange links with your blog; ask your other readers to spread
the word about your blog, too.
 Sprinkling keywords and categories: Blogs are like other Web pages:
Although their contents change frequently, search engines index them.
The more keywords you include in your postings, and the greater the
range of subjects you cover, the more likely you are to have your blog
turn up in a set of search results.
 Posting consistently: When readers latch on to a blog they like, they
visit it frequently. You need to post something — anything — on a daily
basis, or at least several times a week.
 Syndicating your blog: One way of spreading the word about your
blog is providing a “feed” of its latest contents, such as the headings of
posts and the dates of the latest posts. This summary is automatically
prepared in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) by most blogging tools.
You make the feed of your blog available on its home page; sites that
aggregate (in other words, collect) the feeds from many of their favorite
blogs can collect them and quickly know when the blogs have been
updated.
If you can make a living at blogging or at end up with some “fun money” at
the end of each month, more power to you. But don’t go into blogging with
that attitude, or you’ll lose interest right away. Look at a blog as another tool
in your online business toolkit — another way of getting your message before
the public, another place where you can steer visitors to your Web site or
your store on eBay or Yahoo!. It makes sense to treat your blog as a venue
where you talk about what you like to buy and sell online and to strike up
ongoing conversations among your customers and clients. In other words,
you don’t generate income with a blog by selling directly to the public. You
try to build up a number of loyal readers and attract advertising revenue —
or simply attract more customers to your Web site.
111
Chapter 4: Exploiting New Ways to Build Business

Building Community
As an article in E-Commerce Times put it: “Friendship Sells.” Studies consistently
show that people who spend large amounts of time in community venues
such as discussion forums end up spending money on the same Web site
(eBay is the perfect example). It’s a “value proposition,” but you can’t attach
a specific dollar value to it.

No bells, no whistles, all trust: 
The beauty of Craigslist
When it comes to online communities, you’d be
hard pressed to find one stronger than the
devoted users who regularly post ads and
respond to ads on one of the Craigslist sites
around the world. Craigslist (www.craigs
list.org) is a true Internet phenomenon. It
was started by Craig Newmark back in 1995 as
a simple e-mail newsletter announcing upcom-
ing cultural events in Craig’s hometown, San
Francisco. Over time, the recipients began to
use the newsletter to post notices and sell
items. Then job notices were posted.
Before long, participants came to depend on
Craigslist to find out what was going on in their
communities, to find items for sale, or to find
jobs. Newmark steadfastly refused to add flashy
graphics, high-tech programming, or other fea-
tures to his site. He also refused many offers to
purchase his newsletter. He spent seven days a
week keeping his newsletter’s content reliable
and free of e-mail spams and scams. His grate-
ful visitors have since come to rely on Craigslist’s
content as “for real” rather than a come-on, and
they faithfully trust it and use it.
The work has generated a substantial income
for Craigslist. Reportedly, its annual income
approaches $10 million (as reported by
Newmark’s assistant in an article at www.sign
onsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040913/
news_mz1b13craig.html). That income
apparently comes not from flashy banner ads or
popup windows, but from users who pay to post
classified ads: Employers pay from $25 to $75 to
post job listings, depending on the city in which
they are located. eBay recently purchased a
25 percent interest in Craigslist but has pledged
not to change the design. Newmark reportedly
wants eBay to help him deflect constant
approaches from spammers and scammers.
What’s the lesson for you? When you’re just
starting out, it pays to
 Focus on the quality of your content.
 Make your site useful for individuals.
 Develop a loyal customer or user base.
 Knock yourself out to keep your site up to
date.
If you can turn your Web site into a resource,
income will follow.

Community building on commercial Web sites doesn’t necessarily involve 
discussion boards or chat rooms. Anything you can do to get your customers
communicating with one another will do it. On Amazon.com, a kind of com-
munity feel is created by the book reviews written by individual readers and
“Top 10” book lists let visitors share their views.
You can find the aforementioned E-Commerce Times article at www.ecommerce
times.com/story/18096.html.
Partnerships
The notion of online community cuts both ways: It’s not only for consumers
who visit Web sites and join communities, but for businesspeople like you,
too. Some of the liveliest and most popular online communities are eBay
Groups — discussion forums started by eBay members themselves. And
among those, some of the most popular are the ones in which sellers share
tips and advice about boosting their online incomes, finding merchandise to
sell, identifying mystery items, and so on.
Don’t forget that even though you might run a business by yourself, from
your home, you’re not really alone. If you need some encouragement, join a
discussion group, or consult the tips and resources in the Small Business
Associations section of this book’s Online Directory.
Market research
An estimated 135 million individuals in the U.S. are online (with an estimated
4 million new users going online for the first time in August 2004 alone,
according to a Neilsen//NetRatings report summarized at
www.clickz.com/stats/sectors/geographics/article.php/3427141
Given the sheer number of consumers who are on the Web, it stands to reason
that you can find out a lot about those individuals by going online. If you don’t
have any awareness of who your potential customers are and what they want,
you may never get them to pull out their credit cards and make purchases
from you. You can do your own market research by going online to find your
customers, listen to their views in chat rooms and on discussion forums, and
do some market research. Approach consumers who already buy the types of
products or services that you want to sell.
113
Chapter 4: Exploiting New Ways to Build Business

Consult the Guerilla Marketing books (gmarketing.com) for insights into 
different ways to reach your target consumers. Also see the section about
guerilla marketing and advertising strategies in Chapter 15.
The other aspect of market research that is perfectly executed with a Web
browser is research into your own online competitors — businesses that
already do what you hope to do. It can be discouraging, at first, to discover
companies that have already cleared the trail that you hoped to blaze. But
the chances of doing something absolutely unique on the Web are small or
nonexistent. But use the discovery as an educational opportunity to find out
whether there is a market for your product and a way to sell it that differs
from existing competitors. Take note of features displayed by your competi-
tors’ Web sites, such as the following:
 Selling: How does the Web site do its selling? Does it sell only in one loca-
tion, or does its Web site supplement eBay or Amazon.com sales or a
brick-and-mortar business? Does the site make suggestions about related
items that a consumer might want (a practice known as up-selling)?
 Organization: How is the Web site organized? Is it easy to find specific
products or information about them? How many navigational aids (navi-
gation bars, drop-down menu lists, site maps, and the like) are provided?
 Depth: How many levels of information are included on the Web site?
The more information is offered on the site, the stickier (more able to
hold a visitor’s attention) the site becomes. Try to make your own Web
site just as deep and sticky.
In your review of the competition’s Web presentation, make a list of features
that you can emulate as well as features you can improve on. Your goal should
not be to copy the site, but to discover your own unique niche and identify
customers whose needs might not be addressed by the other venue.
Don’t you wish you could install a hidden microphone to eavesdrop on your
customers as they surf the Web? You can do some eavesdropping, but on a
different part of the Internet — namely, Usenet. Usenet, the part of the Internet
that consists of thousands of newsgroups, is separate from the Web but can be
accessed from the Web through sites such as Google Groups (groups.google.
com). You can “listen in” on newsgroup discussions by finding groups that fit
your type of commerce and then lurking — that is, reading the messages with-
out responding to them. After acquainting yourself with the group’s concerns,
you can post your own newsgroup messages and begin to determine your cus-
tomers’ concerns more directly. Keep in mind, though, that it’s important to
avoid overt advertising for your business in a newsgroup, which can provoke
an angry response from the group’s membership.

attracts customers in the first place and encourages them
to stay to browse. I also show you how to get your pages
up and running quickly, to equip your site (and yourself)
to handle many different kinds of electronic purchases, and
to keep improving your site so that it runs more efficiently.

ot so long ago, a business that was on the World Wide Web was distinc-

Web. As cyberspace fills up with small businesses trying to find their niches,
standing out from the crowd and attracting attention on the Internet becomes
increasingly difficult.
But the same tried and true principles apply even though Web surfers are
increasingly mobile and increasingly accustomed to sophisticated content.
You don’t have to load your site down with scripts, animations, and flashy
gimmicks. The trick is to have no trick: Keep your site simple, well organized,
and content rich.
In this chapter, I present one of the best ways for a new business to attract
attention online: through a clearly organized and eye-catching Web site.
(Another strategy for attracting visitors — developing promotions and 
content that encourages interaction — is the subject of Chapter 6.)

Feng Shui Your Web Site
According to the Web site called The Geomancer (thegeomancer.netfirms.
com/fengshui.htm), Feng Shui is the art of arranging objects in an environ-
ment to achieve (among other things) success in your career, wealth, and
happiness. If that’s true, you should try to practice some Feng Shui with your
online business environment — that is, your Web site. 
Although you may be tempted to jump right into the creation of a cool Web
site, take a moment to plan. Whether you’re setting off on a road trip across
the nation or building a new addition for your house, you’ll progress more
smoothly by drawing a map of where you want to go. Do you remember
when you were a tiny little nipper and did your homework with a pencil
and paper? Dig down into your miscellaneous drawer until you find these
ancient tools and then make a list of the elements you want to have on
your site.
Look over the items on your list and break them into two or three main 
categories. These main categories will branch off your home page, which
functions as the grand entrance for your online business site. You can then
draw a map of your site that assumes the shape of a triangle, as shown in
Figure 5-1.

Making them fall in love at first site
First impressions are critical on the Web, where
shoppers have the ability to jump from site to
site with a click of the mouse button. A few extra
seconds of downtime waiting for complex images
or mini-computer programs called Java applets
to download can cause your prospective buyer
to lose patience and you to lose a sale.
How do you make visitors to your welcome page
feel like they are being greeted with open arms?
Here are some suggestions:
 Keep it simple: Don’t overload any one page
with more than three or four images. Keep
all images 20K or less in size.
 Find a fast host: Some Web servers have
super-fast connections to the Internet and
others use slower lines. Test your site; if
your pages take 10 or 20 seconds or more
to appear, ask your host company why and
find out whether they can move you to a
faster machine.
 Offer a bargain: Nothing attracts attention as
much as a contest, a giveaway, or a special
sales promotion. If you have anything that
you can give away, either through a contest
or a deep discount, do it. See Chapter 6 for
more ideas.
 Provide instant gratification: Make sure that
your most important information appears at
or near the top of your page. Readers on the
Web don’t like having to scroll through sev-
eral screens worth of material in order to
get to the information they want.

Note: The page heading “Background Information” is a placeholder for detailed
information about some aspect of your online business. For my brother’s audio
restoration business, I suggested that he include a page of technical informa-
tion listing the equipment he uses and describing the steps he takes to process
audio. You can write about your experience with and love for what you buy
and sell, or anything else that will personalize your site and build trust. 
The preceding example results in a very simple Web site. But there’s nothing
wrong with starting out simple. For my brother, who is creating his first Web
site and is intimidated by getting started, this simple model is working well.
Many other businesses start with a three-layered organization for their Web
sites. This arrangement divides the site into two sections, one about the com-
pany and one about the products or services for sale (see Figure 5-2).

Chapter 5: Giving Your Business Site Structure and Style

Think of your home page as the lobby of a museum where you get the help of
the friendly person at the information desk who hands you a list of the spe-
cial exhibits you can visit that day and shows you a map so you can begin to
figure out how you’re going to get from here to there. Remember to include
the following items on your home page:
 The name of the store or business
 Your logo, if you have one
 Links to the main areas of your site or, if your site isn’t overly extensive,
to every page
 Contact information, such as your e-mail address, phone/fax numbers,
and (optionally) your business address so that people know where to
find you in the Land Beyond Cyberspace
Nip and Tuck: Establishing 
a Visual Identity
The prospect of designing a Web site may be intimidating if you haven’t tried
it before. But just remember that it really boils down to a simple principle:
effective visual communication that conveys a particular message. The first
step in creating graphics is not to open a painting program and start drawing,
but rather to plan your page’s message. Next, determine the audience you
want to reach with that message and think about how your graphics can best
communicate what you want to say. Some ways to do this follow:
 Gather ideas from Web sites that use graphics well — both award-winning
sites and sites created by designers who are using graphics in new or
unusual ways. To find some award winners, check out The Webby Awards
(www.webbyawards.com) and The International Web Page Awards (www.
websiteawards.com).
 Use graphics consistently from page to page to create an identity and
convey a consistent message.
 Know your audience. Create graphics that meet visitors’ needs and
expectations. If you’re selling fashions to teenagers, go for neon colors
and out-there graphics. If you’re selling financial planning to senior citi-
zens, choose a distinguished and sophisticated typeface.
How do you become acquainted with your customers when it is likely that
you will never actually meet them face to face? Find newsgroups and mailing
lists in which potential visitors to your site are discussing subjects related to
what you plan to publish on the Web. Read the posted messages to get a sense
of the concerns and vocabulary of your intended audience.

Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Choosing wallpaper that won’t 
make you a wallflower
The technical term for the wallpaper behind the contents of a Web page is its
background. Most Web browsers display the background of a page as light
gray unless you specify something different. In this case, leaving well enough
alone isn’t good enough. If you don’t choose a different color, viewers are likely
to get the impression that the page is poorly designed or that the author of
the page hasn’t put a great deal of thought into the project. So even a neutral
color, such as white, is better than gray.
You can change the background of your Web page by tinkering with the HTML
source code, but why would you want to? Most Web page creation programs
offer a simple way to specify a color or an image file to serve as the background
of a Web page. For example, in an HTML Editor called Netscape Composer, a
free and easily overlooked Web page design tool that comes with the Netscape
Communicator Web browser package, you use the Page Colors and Background
dialog box (see Figure 5-3) to set your Web page wallpaper.
121
Chapter 5: Giving Your Business Site Structure and Style
Accommodating your viewers
Recent surveys indicate that, for the first time,
the number of Web surfers with broadband con-
nections (such as cable modem or DSL) is just
beginning to outnumber those with dialup modem
connections. But the many Web surfers who still
have very slow Internet connections (or very low
tolerances for waiting) may not have the band-
width to display even ordinary images quickly
enough. And, although it may be tempting to
show off, you may as well forget about present-
ing such content as live video, teleconferencing,
and other graphics files on the Web. After many
minutes or even just seconds of waiting, the
surfer is likely to hit the browser’s Stop button,
with the result that no graphics appear at all.
How do you prevent customers from blocking
out your beautiful graphics and ruining the whole
effect? Some alternatives include
 Creating low-resolution alternatives to high-
resolution graphics, such as thumbnails
(postage-stamp sized versions of larger
images)
 Cropping images to keep them small
 Using line art whenever possible, rather
than high-resolution photos
By using the same image more than once on a
Web page, you can give the impression of greater
activity but yet not slow down the appearance
of the entire page. Why? If you repeat the same
image three times, your customer’s browser has
to download the image file only once. It stores the
image in a storage area, called disk cache,on the
user’s hard drive. To display the other instances
of the image, the browser retrieves the file from
the disk cache, so the second and third images
appear much more quickly than the first one did.
Users can also disable image display altogether
so they don’t see graphics on any of the sites
they visit. The solution: Always provide a simple
textual alternative to your images so that, if the
user has disabled the display of a particular
image, a word or two describing that image
appears in its place.

Color your Web site effective
You can use colors to elicit a particular mood or emotion and also to convey
your organization’s identity on the Web. The right choice of color can create
impressions ranging from elegant to funky.
The basic colors chosen by the package-delivery company United Parcel
Service (www.ups.com) convey to customers that it is a staid and reliable
company, and the U.S. Postal Service (www.usps.gov) sticks to the patriotic
choice of red, white, and blue. In contrast, the designers of the HotHotHot
hot sauce site (www.hothothot.com) combine fiery colors and original art to
convey a spice that sizzles.
When selecting colors for your own Web pages, consider the demographics
of your target audience. Do some research on what emotions or impressions
are conveyed by different colors and which colors best match the mission or
identity of your business. Refer to resources such as the online essay by Noble
Image Web Design (www.nobleimage.com/no_flash/articles/color_
choices.htm), which examines in some detail the subject of how color
choices make Web surfers react differently.
Even if you have the taste of a professional designer, you need to be aware
of what happens to color on the Web. The best color choices for Web back-
grounds are ones that don’t shift dramatically from browser to browser or
platform to platform. The best palette for use on the Web is a set of 216 colors
that is common to all browsers. These are called browser-safe colors because
they appear pretty much the same from browser to browser and on different
monitors. The palette itself appears on Victor Engel’s Web site (the-light.
com/netcol.html).
Figure 5-3:

122
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Keep in mind that the colors you use must have contrast so that they don’t
blend into one another. For example, you don’t want to put purple type on a
brown or blue background, or yellow type on a white background. Remember
to use light type against a dark background, and dark type against a light
background. That way, all your page’s contents will show up.
As long as your type and graphics are visible, there is no color choice that
will create a magic spell. You should first pay attention to your gut reactions.
Then get feedback from your colleagues and test your choice on a few sample
members of your audience before you make your final decision.
Tiling images in the background
You can use an image rather than a solid color to serve as the background of
a page. You specify an image in the HTML code of your Web page (or in your
Web page editor), and browsers automatically tile the image, reproducing it
over and over to fill up the current width and height of the browser window.
This isn’t the time to be totally wild and crazy. Background images only work
when they’re subtle and don’t interfere with the page contents. Be careful to
choose an image that doesn’t have any obvious lines that will create a dis-
tracting pattern when tiled. The effect you are trying to create should literally
resemble wallpaper.
What you absolutely don’t want to have happen is that the background image
makes the page unreadable. Visit the Maine Solar House home page (www.
solarhouse.com) shown later in Figure 5-8 for a rare example of a back-
ground image that is faint enough to not interfere with foreground images
and that actually adds something to the page’s design.
Using Web typefaces like a pro
If you create a Web page and don’t specify that the text be displayed in a 
particular font, the browser that displays the page will use its default font —
which is usually Times or Helvetica (although individual users can customize
their browsers by picking a different default font).
However, you don’t have to limit yourself to the same-old/same-old. As a Web
page designer, you can exercise a degree of control over the appearance of
your Web page by specifying that the body type and headings be displayed in a
particular nonstandard font. A few of the choices available to you have names
such as Arial, Courier, Century Schoolbook, and so on. But just because you
fall in love with a particular typeface doesn’t mean your audience will be able
to admire it in all its beauty. The problem is that you don’t have ultimate con-
trol over whether a given browser will display the specified typeface because
you don’t know for sure whether the individual user’s system has access to
123
Chapter 5: Giving Your Business Site Structure and Style

your preferred typefaces. If the particular font you specified is not available,
the browser will fall back on its default font (which, again, is probably Helvetica
or Times).
That’s why, generally speaking, when you design Web pages, you’re better off
picking a generic typeface that is built into virtually every computer’s operat-
ing system. This convention ensures that your Web pages look more or less the
same no matter what Web browser or what type of computer displays them.
Where, exactly, do you specify type fonts, colors, and sizes for the text on a
Web page? Again, special HTML tags tell Web browsers what fonts to display,
but you don’t need to mess with these tags yourself if you’re using a Web page
creation tool. The specific steps you take depend on what Web design tool
you’re using. In Macromedia Dreamweaver, you have the option of specifying a
group of preferred typefaces rather than a single font in the Property Inspector
(see Figure 5-4). If the viewer doesn’t have one font in the group, another font
is displayed. Check the Help files with your own program to find out exactly
how to format text and what typeface options you have.
Not all typefaces are equal in the eye of the user. Serif typefaces, such as Times
Roman, are considered to be more readable (at least, for printed materials) than
sans-serif fonts, such as Helvetica. However, an article on the Web Marketing
Today Web site (www.wilsonweb.com/wmt6/html-email-fonts.htm) found
that by a whopping 2 to 1 margin, the sans-serif font Arial is considered more
readable on a Web page than Times Roman.

If you want to make sure that a heading or block of type appears in a specific
typeface (especially a nonstandard one that isn’t displayed as body text by
Web browsers), scan it or create the heading in an image-editing program and
insert it into the page as a graphic image. But make sure it doesn’t clash with
the generic typefaces that appear on the rest of your page. 
Clip art is free and fun
Not everyone has the time or resources to scan photos or create their own
original graphics. But that doesn’t mean you can’t add graphic interest to your
Web page. Many Web page designers use clip-art bullets, diamonds, or other
small images next to list items or major Web page headings to which they
want to call special attention. Clip art can also provide a background pattern
for a Web page or highlight sales headings such as Free! New! or Special!
When I first started out in the print publications business, I bought catalogs of
illustrations, literally clipped out the art, and pasted it down. It’s still called clip
art, but now the process is different. In keeping with the spirit of exchange
that has been a part of the Internet since its inception, some talented and
generous artists have created icons, buttons, and other illustrations in elec-
tronic form and offered them free for downloading.
Here are some suggestions for sources of clip art on the Web:
 Barry’s Clip Art Server (www.barrysclipart.com)
 Clip Art Universe (nzwwa.com/mirror/clipart)
 The Yahoo! page full of links to clip art resources (dir.yahoo.com/
Computers_and_Internet/Graphics/Clip_Art)
If you use Microsoft Office, you have access to plenty of clip art images that
come with the software. If you’re using Word, just choose Insert➪Picture➪
Clip Art to view clip art images as displayed in the Insert Picture dialog box. 
If these built-in images aren’t sufficient, you can also connect to a special
Microsoft Clip Gallery Live Web site by clicking the Clips Online toolbar
button in the Insert Clip Art dialog box. Web page editors — such as Microsoft
FrontPage and CoffeeCup HTML Editor — come with their own clip art
libraries, too.
Be sure to read the copyright fine print before you copy graphics. All artists
own the copyright to their work. It’s up to them to determine how they want
to give someone else the right to copy their work. Sometimes, the authors
require you to pay a small fee if you want to copy their work, or they may
restrict use of their work to nonprofit organizations.

Chapter 5: Giving Your Business Site Structure and Style

A picture is worth a thousand words
Some customers know exactly what they want from the get-go and don’t need
any help from you. But most customers love to shop around or could use some
encouragement to move from one item or catalog page to another. This is
where images can play an important role.
Even if you use only some basic clip art, such as placing spheres or arrows
next to sale items, your customer is likely to thank you by buying more. A
much better approach, though, is to scan or take digital images of your sale
items and provide compact, clear images of them on your site. Here’s a quick
step-by-step guide to get you started:
1. Choose the right image to scan.
After you purchase a scanner or digital camera (see the suggestions in
Chapter 2), the next step is to select images (if you’re going to scan) or
take images (if you’re using a camera) that are well illuminated, have
good contrast, and are relatively small in size. 
The original quality of an image is just as important as how you scan or
retouch it. Images that are murky or fuzzy in print will be even worse
when viewed on a computer screen.
2. Preview the image.
Most digital cameras let you preview images so that you can decide
whether to keep or delete individual pictures before downloading to your
computer. If you’re working with a scanner, scanning programs let you
make a quick preview scan of an image so that you can get an idea of what
it looks like before you do the actual scan. When you press the Preview
button, you hear a whirring sound as the optical device in the scanner
captures the image. A preview image appears on-screen, surrounded by
a marquee box (a rectangle made up of dashes), as shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5:

quee box

126
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

3. Crop the image.
Cropping an image is a good idea because it highlights the most impor-
tant contents and reduces the file size. Reducing the file size of an image
should always be one of your most important goals — the smaller the
image, the quicker it appears in someone’s browser window. Cropping
means that you resize the box around the image in order to select the
portion of the image that you want to keep and leave out the parts of the
image that aren’t essential.
Almost all scanning and graphics programs offer separate options for
cropping an image and reducing the image size. By cropping the image,
you eliminate parts of the image you don’t want, and this does reduce
the image size. But it doesn’t reduce the size of the objects within the
image. Resizing the overall image size is a separate step, which enables
you to change the dimensions of the entire image without eliminating
any contents.
4. Select an input mode.
Tell the scanner or graphics program how you want it to save the visual
data — as color, line art (used for black-and-white drawings), or grayscale
(used for black-and-white photos). 
5. Set the resolution.
In Chapter 2, I note that digital images are made up of little bits (dots)
of computerized information called pixels. The more pixels per inch,
the higher the level of detail. When you scan an image, you can tell the
scanner to make the dots smaller (creating a smoother image) or larger
(resulting in a more jagged image). This adjustment is called setting the
resolution of the image. (When you take a digital photo, the resolution of
the image depends on your camera’s settings.)
How many dots per inch (dpi) do you want your image to be? When
you’re scanning for the Web, you expect your images to appear primarily
on computer screens. Because many computer monitors can display res-
olutions only up to 72 dpi, 72 dpi — a relatively rough resolution — is an
adequate resolution for a Web image. (By contrast, many laser printers
print at a resolution of 600 dpi.) But using this coarse resolution has the
advantage of keeping the image’s file size small. Remember, the smaller
the file size, the more quickly an image appears when your customers
load your page in their Web browsers.
6. Adjust contrast and brightness.
Virtually all scanning programs and graphics editing programs provide
brightness and contrast controls that you can adjust with your mouse to
improve the image. If you’re happy with the image as is, leave the bright-
ness and contrast set where they are. (You can also leave the image as is
and adjust brightness and contrast later in a separate graphics program,
such as Paint Shop Pro, which you can try out by downloading it from
the JASC Web site, www.jasc.com.)
127
Chapter 5: Giving Your Business Site Structure and Style

7. Reduce the image size.
The old phrase “good things come in small packages” is never more true
than when you’re improving your digital image. If you’re scanning an
image that is 8" x 10" and you’re sure that it needs to be about 4" x 5"
when it appears on your Web page, scan it at 50 percent of the original
size. This step reduces the file size right away and makes the file easier
to transport. That’s really important if you have to put it on a floppy disk
to move it from one computer to another.
8. Scan away!
Your scanner makes a beautiful whirring sound as it turns those colors
into pixels. Because you’re scanning only at 72 dpi, the process shouldn’t
take too long. 
9. Save the file.
Now you can save your image to disk. Most programs let you do this by
choosing File➪Save. In the dialog box that appears, enter a name for your
file and select a file format. (Because you are working with images to be
published on the Web, remember to save either in GIF or JPEG format.)
When you give your image a name, be sure to add the correct filename exten-
sion. Web browsers recognize only image files with extensions such as .gif,
.jpg, or .jpeg. If you name your image product and save it in GIF format,
call it product.gif. If you save it in JPEG format and you’re using a PC, call
it product.jpg. On a Macintosh, call it product.jpeg.
128
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 
GIF versus JPEG
Web site technology and HTML may have
changed dramatically over the past several
years, but for the most part, there are only two
types of images as far as Web pages are con-
cerned: GIF and JPEG. Both formats use meth-
ods that compress computer image files so that
the visual information contained within them
can be transmitted easily over computer net-
works. (PNG, a third format designed a few
years ago as a successor to GIF, is appearing
online more and more, but it still isn’t as widely
used as GIF.)
GIF (pronounced either “jiff” or “giff”) stands for
Graphics Interchange Format. GIF is best suited to
text, line art, or images with well-defined edges.
Special types of GIF allow images with trans-
parent backgrounds to be interlaced (broken
into layers that appear gradually over slow con-
nections) and animated. JPEG (pronounced “jay-
peg”) stands for Joint Photographic Experts
Group, the name of the group that originated the
format. JPEG is preferred for large photos and
continuous tones of grayscale or color that
need greater compression.

For more details on scanning images, check out Scanning For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Mark Chambers (Wiley).
Creating a logo
An effective logo establishes your online business’s graphic identity in no
uncertain terms. A logo can be as simple as a rendering of the company name
that imparts an official typeface or color. Whatever text it includes, a logo is
a small, self-contained graphic object that conveys the group’s identity and
purpose. Figure 5-6 shows an example of a logo.
A logo doesn’t have to be a fabulously complex drawing with drop-shadows
and gradations of color. A simple, type-only logo can be as good as gold. Pick
a typeface you want, choose your graphic’s outline version, and fill the letters
with color.

Extreme Web Pages: 
Advanced Layouts
People who have some experience creating Web sites typically use frames
and tables. On the other hand, they might be right up the alley of an adven-
turous type who wants to start an online business. So this section includes
some quick explanations of what tables and frames are so that you know
where to start when and if you decide you do want to use them.
130
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 
A quick HTML primer
Thanks to Web page creation tools, you don’t
have to master HyperText Markup Language in
order to create your own Web pages, although
some knowledge of HTML is helpful when it
comes to editing pages and understanding how
they’re put together.
HTML is a markup language, not a computer
programming language. You use it in much the
same way that old-fashioned editors marked up
copy before they gave it to typesetters. A
markup language allows you to identify major
sections of a document, such as body text,
headings, title, and so on. A software program
(in the case of HTML, a Web browser) is pro-
grammed to recognize the markup language
and to display the formatting elements that you
have marked.
Markup tags are the basic building blocks of
HTML as well as its more complex and powerful
cousin, eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Tags
enable you to structure the appearance of your
document so that, when it is transferred from
one computer to another, it will look the way you
described it. HTML tags appear within carrot-
shaped brackets. Most HTML commands require
a start tag at the beginning of the section and an
end tag (which usually begins with a backslash)
at the end.
For example, if you place the HTML tags <B>and
</B> around the phrase “This text will be bold,”
the words appear in bold type on any browser
that displays them, no matter if it’s running on a
Windows-based PC, a UNIX workstation, a
Macintosh, a palm device that’s Web enabled,
or any other computer.
Many HTML commands are accompanied by
attributes, which provide a browser with more
specific instructions on what action the tag is to
perform. In the following lines of HTML, SRC is
an attribute that works with the <IMG> tag to
identify a file to display:
<IMG SRC=”house.jpg”>
Each attribute is separated from an HTML com-
mand by a single blank space. The equal sign
(=) is an operator that introduces the value on
which the attribute and command will function.
Usually, the value is a filename or a directory
path leading to a specific file that is to be dis-
played on a Web page. The straight (as opposed
to curly) quotation marks around the value are
essential for the HTML command to work.

Setting the tables for your customers
Tables are to designers what statistics are to sports fans. In the case of a Web
page, they provide another means to present information in a graphically
interesting way. Tables were originally intended to present “tabular” data in
columns and rows, much like a spreadsheet. But by using advanced HTML
techniques, you can make tables a much more integrated and subtle part of
your Web page.
Because you can easily create a basic table by using Web page editors, such
as HotDog, Netscape Composer, and FrontPage, starting with one of these
tools makes sense. Some adjustments with HTML are probably unavoidable,
however, especially if you want to use tables to create blank columns on a
Web page (as I explain later in this section). Here is a quick rundown of the
main HTML tags used for tables:
 <TABLE> </TABLE> encloses the entire table. The BORDER attribute sets
the width of the line around the cells.
 <TR> </TR> encloses a table row, a horizontal set of cells.
 <TD> </TD> defines the contents of an individual cell. The HEIGHT and
WIDTH attributes control the size of each cell. For example, the following
code tells a browser that the table cell is 120 pixels wide:
<TD WIDTH=120> Contents of cell </TD>
Don’t forget that the cells in a table can contain images as well as text. Also,
individual cells can have different colors from the cells around them. You can
add a background color to a table cell by adding the BGCOLOR attribute to the
<TD> table cell tag.
The clever designer can use tables in a hidden way to arrange an entire page,
or a large portion of a page, by doing two things:
 Set the table border to 0. Doing so makes the table outline invisible, so
the viewer sees only the contents of each cell, not the lines bordering
the cell.
 Fill some table cells with blank space so that they act as empty columns
that add more white space to a page.
An example of the first approach, that of making the table borders invisible,
appears in Figure 5-7: David Nishimura’s Vintage Pens Web site (www.vintage
pens.com) where he sells vintage writing instruments.

Framing your subject
Frames are subdivisions of a Web page, each consisting of its own separate
Web document. Depending on how the designer sets up the Web page, visitors
may be able to scroll through one frame independently of the other frames
on the same page. A mouse click on a hypertext link contained in one frame
may cause a new document to appear in an adjacent frame.
Simple two-frame layouts such as the one used by one of my personal favorite
Web sites, Maine Solar House (see Figure 5-8), can be very effective. A page
can be broken into as many frames as the designer wants, but you typically
want to stick with only two to four frames because they make the page con-
siderably more complex and slower to appear in its entirety.
Frames fit within the BODY section of an HTML document. In fact, the
<FRAMESET> </FRAMESET> tags actually take the place of the <BODY>
</BODY> tags and are used to enclose the rest of the frame-specific elements.
Each of the frames on the page is then described by <FRAME> </FRAME> tags.
Only the more advanced Web page creation programs provide you with menu
options and toolbar buttons that enable you to create frames without having
to enter the HTML manually. Most of the popular Web page editors do this,
including Macromedia Dreamweaver and HotDog Professional by Sausage
Software. See each program’s Help topics for specific instructions on how to
implement framing tools.

Frames add interactivity and graphic interest to a page, but many users dis-
like the extra time they require. As a Web page designer, be sure to provide a
“no frames” alternative to a “frames” layout.
Breaking the grid with layers
Tables and frames bring organization and interactivity to Web pages, but they
confine your content to rows and columns. If you feel confined by the old up-
down, left-right routine, explore layers for arranging your Web page content.
Layers, like table cells and frames, act as containers for text and images on a
Web page. Layers are unique because they can be moved around freely on
the page — they can overlap one another, and they can “bleed” right to the
page margin.
Layers carry some big downsides: You can’t create them with just any Web
editor. Macromedia Dreamweaver is the Web editor of choice, and it’s not free
(at this writing, Dreamweaver MX 2004 costs $339). Layers are supported only
by versions 4.0 or later of Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.
However, Dreamweaver lets you create a layout in layers and then convert it
to tables, which are supported by almost all browsers.

Chapter 5: Giving Your Business Site Structure and Style

With Dreamweaver, you can draw a layer directly on the Web page you’re 
creating. You add text or images to the layer, and then resize or relocate it on
the page by clicking and dragging it freely. The result is some innovative page
designs that don’t conform to the usual grid.
Hiring a Professional Web Designer
Part of the fun of running your own business is doing things yourself. So it
comes as no surprise that most of the entrepreneurs I interviewed in the course
of writing this book do their own Web page design work. They discovered
how to create Web sites by reading books or taking classes on the subject.
But in many cases, the initial cost of hiring someone to help you design your
online business can be a good investment in the long run. Keep in mind that
after you pay someone to help you develop a look, you can probably imple-
ment it in the future more easily yourself. For example:
 If you need business cards, stationery, brochures, or other printed ma-
terial in addition to a Web site, hiring someone to develop a consistent
look for everything at the beginning is worth the money.
 You can pay a designer to get you started with a logo, color selections,
and page layouts. Then you can save money by adding text yourself.
 If, like me, you’re artistically impaired, consider the benefits of having
your logo or other artwork drawn by a real artist.
Most professional designers charge $40 to $60 per hour for their work. You
can expect a designer to spend five or six hours to create a logo or template.
But if your company uses that initial design for the foreseeable future, you’re
not really paying that much per year.

 Creating compelling content through links and hooks

 Writing friendly, objective prose that sells your products and services
 Inviting customer interaction with forms, e-mail, and more
A
s a writer, I know only too well the challenge of staring at a totally white
piece of paper or a blank computer screen. It’s then that I remember
my writing teacher telling me to “let it flow” and worry about editing after
I’ve unleashed my creativity. That’s good advice up to a point, especially for
something like a Web log. But when it comes to a business Web site, you need
to present the right content in the right way to make prospective clients and
customers want to explore your site the first time and then come back for
more later on.
Because one of my primary points in this chapter is that you need to express
your main message on your business site up front, I do the same by explaining
what I consider to be the right content for an online business. The material
that you include on your site should
 Remember that people who are online absorb information fast 
 Make it easy for visitors to find out who you are and what you have to
offer
 Be friendly and informal in tone, concise in length, and clear in its 
organization
 Help develop the all-important one-to-one-relationship with customers
and clients by inviting dialogue and interaction, both with you and with
others who share the same interests

In other words, you need to be straightforward about who you are and where
you’re coming from on your business site. This chapter is obviously about
writing for the Web. But the idea is not to be satisfied with generating just
any old text. The goal is to craft exciting, well-organized, and easily digestible
information. What follows is how to put these objectives into action.
Features that Attract Customers
Half the battle with developing content for a business Web site is knowing
what shoppers online want and determining strategies for providing it to
them. Identifying your target audience will help you devise a message that will
make each potential customer think you are speaking directly to him or her.
But you also should keep in mind some general concepts that will help you
market successfully to all ages, both genders, and every socioeconomic group.
Studies of how people absorb the information on a Web page indicate that
people don’t really read the contents from top to bottom (or left to right, or
frame to frame) in a linear way. In fact, most Web surfers don’t read in the 
traditional sense at all. Instead, they browse so quickly you’d think they have
an itchy mouse finger. They “flip through pages” by clicking link after link. As
more Internet users connect with broadband technologies, such as DSL and
cable, they can absorb complex graphics and multimedia. On the other hand,
lots of users are beginning to use palm devices, pocket PCs, Web-enabled cell
phones, and even Internet-ready automobiles to get online. Because your
prospective customers don’t necessarily have tons of computing power or
hours’ worth of time to explore your site, the best rule is to keep it simple.
People who are looking for things on the Web are often in a state of hurried
distraction. Think about a television watcher browsing during a commercial
or a harried parent stealing a few moments on the computer while the baby
naps. Imagine this person surfing with one hand on a mouse, the other dip-
ping chips into salsa. This person isn’t in the mood to listen as you tell your
fondest hopes and dreams for success, starting with playing grocery store
cashier as a toddler. Here’s what this shopper is probably thinking:
“Look, I don’t have time to read all this. My show is about to come back on
and I still need to go to the bathroom.”
“What’s this? Why does this page take so long to load? And I paid good
money to get a direct connection installed. I swear, sometimes I wish the
Web didn’t have any graphics. Here, I’ll click this. No, wait! I’ll click that.
On no, now the baby is fussing already.”
The following sections describe some ways to attract the attention of the dis-
tracted and get them to scroll down to exactly where you want them to go.
136
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Don’t be shy about what you have to say
Don’t keep anyone in suspense about who you are and what you do. Keep in
mind that people who come to a Web site give that site less than a minute
(in fact, I’ve heard only 20 seconds) to answer their primary questions:
 Who are you, anyway?
 All right, so what is your main message or mission?
 Well then, what do you have here for me?
 Why should I choose your site to investigate rather than all the others
that seem to be about the same?
This is a pretty intimidating picture, I admit. But I really believe that this is
what most Web surfers are thinking as they randomly scroll through sites.
A study conducted by online advertiser DoubleClick, Inc. in the first quarter
of 2004 (www.mediapost.com/dtls_dsp_news.cfm?newsID=253716&news
Date=06/03/2004) found that as many as 48 percent of online shoppers
abandoned their shopping carts and failed to complete purchases because
pages were too slow to load. The Consumer 40 Internet Performance Index by
Keynote Systems (www.keynote.com/solutions/performance_indices/
consumer_index/consumer_40.html) found in early December 2004 that, in
a survey of 40 Web sites, the average site takes a full 26 seconds or more to
load over a 56Kbps modem. However, Web search engine AltaVista was found
to be among the fastest loading of 40 Internet sites, requiring only 5.30 sec-
onds to appear. Other top finishers prove that just because you have a big
commercial Web site, you don’t need to make it complicated: Ameritrade’s
Web page was clocked at 12.58 seconds and CFSBDirect at 7.09 seconds.
When it comes to Web pages, it pays to put the most important components
first: who you are, what you do, how you stand out from any competing sites,
and contact information.
If you have a long list of items to sell, you probably can’t fit everything you
have to offer right on the first page of your site. Even if you could, you wouldn’t
want to: As in a television newscast, it’s better to prioritize the contents of
your site so that the “breaking stories” or the best contents appear at the
top, and the rest of what’s in your catalog is arranged in order of importance.
I suppose there are a few gamblers in every group, but I’m not the type that
goes for all or nothing. Think long and hard before you use features that may
scare people away instead of wowing them. I’m talking about those “splash
pages” that contain only a logo or short greeting, and then reload automati-
cally and take the visitor to the main body of a site. I also don’t recommend
loading up your home page with Flash animations or Java applets that take
your prospective customers’ browsers precious seconds to load. 
137
Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

Encourage visitors to click, click, click!
Imagine multi-tasking Web surfers arriving at your Web site with only a frac-
tion of their attention engaged. Make the links easy to read and in obvious
locations. Having a row of links at the top of your home page, each of which
points the visitor to an important area of your site, is always a good idea.
Such links give visitors an idea of what your site contains in a single glance
and immediately encourage viewers to click a primary subsection of your site
and explore further. By placing an interactive table of contents right up front,
you direct surfers right to the material they are looking for.
The links can go at or near the top of the page on either the left or right side.
The Dummies.com home page, shown in Figure 6-1, has a few links just above
the top banner, but also sports links down both the left and right sides.
If you want to be ranked highly by search engines (and who doesn’t) you have
another good reason to place your site’s main topics near the top of the page
in a series of links. Some search services index the first 50 or so words on a
Web page. It therefore stands to reason that if you can get lots of important
keywords included in that index, the chances are better that your site will be
ranked highly in a list of links returned by the service in response to a search.
See Chapters 14 and 15 for more on embedding keywords.
Figure 6-1:
Putting at
least five or
six links near

good idea.
138
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Use the following steps to create links to local files on your Web site by using
Netscape Composer, the free Web page editor that comes with the Netscape
Communicator Web browser. The steps assume that you have started up the
program and that the Web page you want to edit is already open:
1. Select the text or image on your Web page that you want to serve as
the jumping-off point for the link.
If you select a word or phrase, the text is highlighted in black. If you
select an image, a black box appears around the image.
2. Choose Insert➪Link or press Ctrl+L.
The Link Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-2.
3. In the box beneath Link Location, enter the name of the file you want
to link to if you know the filename. 
If the page you want to link to is in the same directory as the page that
contains the jumping-off point, you need to enter only the name of the
Web page. If the page is in another directory, you need to enter a path
relative to the Web page that contains the link (or click the Choose File
button, locate the file in the Open HTML File dialog box, and click the
Open button). 
4. Click OK.
The Link Properties dialog box closes, and you return to the Composer
window. If you made a textual link, the selected text is underlined and in a
different color. If you made an image link, a box appears around the image.

Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

Presenting the reader with links up front doesn’t just help your search
engine rankings, it also indicates that your site is content rich and worthy
of exploration.
Tell us a little about yourself
One thing you need to state clearly as soon as possible on your Web site is
who you are and what you do. Profnet does this by condensing its mission
statement into a single phrase:
Helping Business Professionals Find More Business
Can you identify your primary goal in a single sentence? If not, try to boil
down your goals to two or three sentences at the most. Whatever you do,
make your mission statement more specific and customer oriented than
simply saying, “Out to make lots of money!” Tell prospects what you can
do for them; the fact that you have three kids in college and need to make
money to pay their tuition isn’t really their concern.
Add a search box
One of the most effective kinds of content you can add to your site is a search
box. A search box invites visitors to interact instantly with your Web site. If you
can find a Web host that will help you set up a search box, you don’t have to
mess around with computer scripts and indexing tools. (See the section,
“Make your site searchable,” later in this chapter, for more information.)
Search boxes are commonly found on commercial Web sites. You usually see
them at the top of the home page, right near the links to the major sections of
the site. The Dummies.com Technology page, shown in Figure 6-3, includes a
search box in the upper-right corner of the page.
I’m always looking for freelance writing jobs, but I have to admit that you don’t
really need to hire a professional to make a Web site compelling. You’re not
writing an essay, a term paper, or a book here. Rather, you need to observe
only a few simple rules:
 Provide lots of links and hooks that readers can scan.
 Keep everything concise!
The key word to remember is “short.” Keep sentences short. Limit paragraphs
to one or two sentences in length. You may also want to limit each Web page
to no more than one or two screens in length so that viewers don’t have to
scroll down too far to find what they want — even if they’re on a laptop or
smaller Internet appliance.
140
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Making your content scannable
When you’re writing something on paper, whether it’s a letter to Mom or your
grocery list, contents have to be readable. Contents on your Web site, on the
other hand, have to be scannable. This principle has to do with the way people
absorb information online. Eyes that are staring at a computer screen for many
minutes or many hours tend to jump around a Web page, looking for an inter-
esting bit of information on which to rest. In this section, I suggest ways to
attract those nervous eyes and guide them toward the products you have to
sell or toward the services you want to provide.
I’m borrowing the term scannable from John Morkes and Jakob Nielsen of Sun
Microsystems, who use it in their article “Concise, Scannable, and Objective:
How to Write for the Web” (www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/writing.
html). I include a link to this article in the Internet Directory on this book’s
Web site, along with other tips on enriching the content of your Web pages.
See the section of the Directory called “Developing Compelling Content” for
more information.

Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

Point the way with headings
One hard-to-miss Web page element that’s designed to grab the attention of
your readers’ eyes is a heading. Every Web page needs to contain headings
that direct the reader’s attention to the most important contents. This book
provides a good example. The chapter title (I hope) piques your interest first.
Then the section headings and subheadings direct you to more details on the
topics you want to read about.
Most graphics designers I’ve worked with label their heads with letters of the
alphabet: “A,” “B,” “C,” and so on. In a similar fashion, most Web page editing
tools designate top-level headings with the style Heading 1. Beneath this, you
place one or more Heading 2 headings. Beneath each of those, you may have
Heading 3 and, beneath those, Heading 4. (Headings 5 and 6 are too small to
be useful, in my opinion.) The arrangement may look like this (I’ve indented
the following headings for clarity; you don’t have to indent them on your page):
Miss Cookie’s Delectable Cooking School (Heading 1)
Kitchen Equipment You Can’t Live Without (Heading 2)
The Story of a Calorie Counter Gone Wrong (Heading 2)
Programs of Culinary Study (Heading 2)
Registration (Heading 3)
Course Schedule (Heading 3)
New Course on Whipped Cream Just Added! (Heading 4)
You can energize virtually any heading by telling your audience something
specific about your business. Instead of “Ida’s Antique Mall,” for example, say
something like “Ida’s Antique Mall: The Perfect Destination for the Collector
and the Crafter.” Instead of simply writing a heading like “Stan Thompson, Pet
Grooming,” say something specific, such as “Stan Thompson: We Groom Your
Pet at Our Place or Yours.”
Become an expert list maker
Lists are simple and effective ways to break up text and make your Web con-
tent easier to digest. They’re easy to create and easy for your customer to view
and absorb. For example, suppose that you import your own decorations and
you want to offer certain varieties at a discount during various seasons.
Rather than bury the items you’re offering within an easily overlooked para-
graph, why not divide your list into subgroups so that visitors will find what
they want without being distracted by holidays they don’t even celebrate?
The following example shows how easy lists are to implement if you use
Macromedia Dreamweaver, a popular Web page creation tool that you can
test for yourself for a 30-day trial period by downloading the program from
the Macromedia Web site (www.macromedia.com/downloads). You have
your Web page document open in Dreamweaver, and you’re at that point in
the page where you want to insert a list. Just do the following:
1. Type a heading for your list and then select the entire heading.
142
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

For example, you might type and then select the words This Month’s
Specials.
2. Choose Text➪Paragraph Format. 
A list of paragraph styles appears as a submenu next to the Paragraph
Format submenu.
3. Click a heading style, such as Heading 3, to select it from the list of
styles.
Your text is now formatted as a heading.
4. Click anywhere in the Dreamweaver window to deselect the heading
you just formatted.
5. Press Enter to move to a new line.
6. Type the first item of your list, press Enter, and then type the second
item on the next line.
Repeat until you’ve entered all the items of your list.
7. Select all the items of your list (but not the heading).
8. Choose Text➪List➪Unordered List.
A bullet appears next to each list item, and the items appear closer
together on-screen so that they look more like a list. That’s all there 
is to it! Figure 6-4 shows the result.
Most Web editors let you vary the appearance of the bullet that appears next
to a bulleted list item. For example, you can make it a hollow circle rather
than a solid black dot, or you can choose a rectangle rather than a circle.

Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

Lead your readers on with links
I mean for you to interpret the preceding heading literally, not figuratively. In
other words, I’m not suggesting that you make promises on which you can’t
deliver. Rather, I mean that you should do anything you can to lead your visi-
tors to your site and then get them to stay long enough to explore individual
pages. You can accomplish this goal with a single hyperlinked word that leads
to another page on your site:
More . . .
I see this word all the time on Web pages that present a lot of content. At the
bottom of a list of their products and services, businesses place that word in
bold type: More . . . I’m always interested in finding out what more they could
possibly have to offer me.
Magazines use the same approach. On their covers you’ll find “reefer” phrases
that refer you to the kinds of stories that you’ll find inside. You can do the
same kind of thing on your Web pages. For example, which of the following
links is more likely to get a response?
Next
Next: Paragon’s Success Stories
Whenever possible, tell your visitors what they can expect to encounter as a
benefit when they click a link. Give them a tease — and then a big pay-off for
responding.
Enhance your text with well-placed images
You can add two kinds of images to a Web page: an inline image, which appears
in the body of your page along with your text, or an external image, which is a
separate file that visitors access by clicking a link. The link may take the form
of highlighted text or a small version of the image called a thumbnail.
The basic HTML tag that inserts an image in your document takes the follow-
ing form:
<IMG SRC=”URL”>
This tag tells your browser to display an image (<IMG>) here. “URL” gives
the location of the image file that serves as the source (SRC) for this image.
Whenever possible, you should also include WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes
(as follows) because they help speed up graphics display for many browsers:
<IMG HEIGHT=51 WIDTH=48 SRC=”target.gif”>
Most Web page editors add the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes automatically
when you insert an image. Typically, here’s what happens:
144
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

1. You click the location in the Web page where you want the image to
appear.
2. Then you click an Image toolbar button or choose Insert➪Image to dis-
play an image selection dialog box.
3. Next you enter the name of the image you want to add and click OK.
The image is added to your Web page. (For more information, see
Chapter 5.)
A well-placed image points the way to text that you want people to read imme-
diately. Think about where your own eyes go when you first connect to a Web
page. Most likely, you first look at any images on the page; then you look at
the headings; finally, you settle on text to read. If you can place an image next
to a heading, you virtually ensure that viewers will read the heading.
Freebies: Everyone’s favorite
No matter how much money you have in the bank, you’re bound to respond
to a really good deal. If you want surefire attention, use one of the following
words in the headings on your online business site’s home page:
 Free
 New
 Act (as in Act Now!)
 Sale
 Discount
 Win
Contests and sweepstakes
The word free and the phrase Enter Our Contest can give you a big bang for
your buck when it comes to a business Web page. In fact, few things are as
likely to get viewers to click into a site as the promise of getting something
for nothing.
Giveaways have a number of hidden benefits, too: Everyone who enters
sends you personal information that you can use to compile a mailing list or
prepare marketing statistics. Giveaways get people involved with your site,
and they invite return visits — especially if you hold contests for several
weeks at a time.
Of course, in order to hold a giveaway, you need to have something to give
away. If you make baskets or sell backpacks, you can designate one of your
sale items as the prize. If you can’t afford to give something away, offer a
deep (perhaps 50 percent) discount.
145
Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

You can organize either a sweepstakes or a contest. A sweepstakes chooses
its winner by random selection; a contest requires participants to compete in
some way. The most effective contests on the Internet tend to be simple. If
you hold one, consider including a “Rules” Web page that explains who is eli-
gible, who selects the winner, and any rules of participation.
Be aware of the federal and state laws and regulations that cover sweep-
stakes and contests. Such laws often restrict illegal lotteries as well as the
promotion of alcoholic beverages. Telemarketing is sometimes prohibited in
connection with a contest. Following are some other points to consider:
 Unless you are sure that it’s legal to allow Web surfers from other countries
to participate, you’re safest limiting your contest to U.S. residents only.
 On the contest rules page, be sure to clearly state the starting and ending
dates for receiving entries. Some states have laws requiring you to dis-
close this information.
 Don’t change the ending date of your contest, even if you receive far
fewer entries than you had hoped for.
Before your contest goes online, make sure that you’ve observed all the
legal guidelines by visiting the Arent Fox Contests and Sweepstakes News &
Alerts page:

Your Web page title: The ultimate heading
When you’re dreaming up clever headings for
your Web pages, don’t overlook the “heading”
that appears in the narrow title bar at the very
top of your visitor’s Web browser window: the
title of your Web page.
The two HTML tags <TITLE> and </TITLE>
contain the text that appears within the browser
title bar. But you don’t have to mess with these
nasty HTML codes: All Web page creation pro-
grams give you an easy way to enter or edit a title
for a Web page. In Dreamweaver, you follow
these steps:
1. With the Web page you’re editing open in the
Dreamweaver window, choose Modify➪
Page Properties.
The Page Properties dialog box appears.
2. In the Title text box, enter a title for your page.
3. Click OK.
The Page Properties dialog box closes and
you return to the Dreamweaver window.
The title doesn’t automatically appear in the
title area at the top of the window. When
you view the page in a Web browser, how-
ever, the title is visible.
If you have the Toolbar open, you can also simply
type the Title in the Title box and press Enter. In
either case, make the title as catchy and spe-
cific as possible, but make sure that the title is
no longer than 64 characters. An effective title
refers to your goods or services while grabbing
the viewer’s attention. If your business is called
Myrna’s Cheesecakes, for example, you might
make your title “Smile and Say Cheese! With
Myrna’s Cakes” (40 characters).

www.arentfox.com/quickGuide/businessLines/sweeps/contestsSweep
stakes/contestssweepstakes.html
If you do hold a contest, announce it at the top of your Web page, and hint at
the prizes people can win. Use bold and big type to attract the attention of
your visitors.
Expert tips and insider information
Giveaways aren’t just for businesspeople in retail or wholesale salespeople
who have merchandise they can offer as prizes in a contest. If your work
involves professional services, you can give away something just as valuable:
your knowledge. Publish a simple newsletter that you e-mail to subscribers
on a periodic basis (see Chapter 13 for instructions on how to do this). Or
answer questions by e-mail. Some Web page designers (particularly, college
students who are just starting out) work for next to nothing initially, until
they build a client base and can charge a higher rate for their services.
Make your site searchable
A search box is one of the best kinds of content you can put on your Web
site’s opening page. A search box is a simple text-entry field that lets a visitor
enter a word or phrase. By clicking a button labeled Go, Search, or something
of the sort, the search term or terms are sent to the site, where a script checks
an index of the site’s contents for any files that contain the terms. The script
then causes a list of documents that contain the search terms to appear in
the visitor’s browser window.
Search boxes let visitors instantly scan the site’s entire contents for a word
or phrase. They put visitors in control right away and get them to interact
with your site. They are popular for some very good reasons.
Yes, I recommend some sort of search utility for e-commerce sites. However,
adding a search box to your site doesn’t make much sense if you have only
five to ten pages of content. Add search capability only if you have enough
content to warrant searching. If your site has a sales catalog driven by a 
database, it makes more sense to let your customers use the database
search tool instead of adding one of the site search tools that I describe in
this section.
The problem is that search boxes usually require someone with knowledge
of computer programming to create or implement a program called a CGI
script to do the searching. Someone also has to compile an index of the 
documents on the Web site so that the script can search the documents.
An application such as ColdFusion can do this, but it’s not a program for

But you can get around having to write CGI scripts to add search capabilities
to your site. Choose one of these options:
 Let your Web host do the work: Some hosting services will do the
indexing and creation of the search utility as part of their services.
 Use a free site search service: The server that does the indexing of your
Web pages and holds the index doesn’t need to be the server that hosts
your site. A number of services will make your site searchable for free.
In exchange, you display advertisements or logos in the search results
you return to your visitors.
 Pay for a search service: If you don’t want to display ads on your search
results pages, pay a monthly fee to have a company index your pages and
let users conduct searches. FreeFind (www.freefind.com) has some
economy packages, a free version that forces you to view ads, and a pro-
fessional version including $9 per month for a site of 500 pages or less.
SiteMiner (siteminer.mycomputer.com) charges $19.95 per month for
up to 1,500 pages, but lets you customize your search box and re-index
your site whenever you add new content. 
Judy Vorfeld went beyond having a simple Search This Site text box on her
Office Support Services Web site. She has one at (www.ossweb.com/search.
html) which makes use of Google’s search engine. But as you can see in
Figure 6-5, she also provides a separate Sitemap page that provides a list of
links to her site’s most important contents.

You say you’re up to making your site searchable, and you shudder at the
prospect of either writing your own computer script or finding and editing
someone else’s script to index your site’s contents and actually do the search-
ing? Then head over to Atomz (www.atomz.com) and check out the hosted
application Atomz Search. If your site contains 500 pages or less, you can
also add a search box to your Web page that lets visitors search your site.
Other organizations that offer similar services include: 
 Visit FreeFind (www.freefind.com)
 PicoSearch (www.picosearch.com)

Writing Unforgettable Text
Business writing on the Web differs from the dry, linear report writing one is
often called upon to compose (or worse yet, read) in the corporate world. So
this is your chance to express the real you: You’re online, where sites that are
funny, authors who have a personality, and content that’s quirky are most
likely to succeed.
Striking the right tone
When your friends describe you to someone who has never met you, what do
they say first? Maybe it’s your fashion sense or your collection of salt and
pepper shakers. Your business also has a personality, and the more striking
you make its description on your Web page, the better. Use the tone of your
text to define what makes your business unique and what distinguishes it
from your competition.
Getting a little help from your friends
Tooting your own horn is a fine technique to use in some situations, but you
shouldn’t go overboard with promotional prose that beats readers over the
head. Web readers are looking for objective information they can evaluate for
themselves. An independent review of your site or your products carries far
more weight than your own ravings about how great your site is. Sure, you
know your products and services are great, but you’ll be more convincing
if your offerings can sell themselves, or you can identify third parties to
endorse them.

Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 
Building an online presence takes time
Judy Vorfeld, who goes by the nom de Net
Webgrammar, knows all about finding different
ways to attract a regular clientele. And she
knows how important it is to have good content
in a business Web site. She started the online
version of her business Office Support Services
(www.ossweb.com) from her home in Arizona
in early 1998. She now has a second business
site (www.editingandwritingservices.
com) and a third (www.webgrammar.com),
which serves as a resource for students, edu-
cators, writers, and Web developers.
Q. What would you describe as the primary goal
of your online business?
A. To help small businesses achieve excellent
presentation and communication by copyedit-
ing their print documents, books, and Web sites.
Q. How many hours a week do you work on your
business site?
A. Three to six hours, which includes my syndi-
cated writing tips, surveys, and newsletter,
Communication Expressway (www.ossweb.
com/ezine-archive-index.html).
Q. How do you promote your site?
A. Participating in newsgroups, writing articles
for Internet publications, adding my URLs to good
search engines and directories, moderating dis-
cussion lists and forums for others, offering free
articles and tips on my sites, and networking
locally and on the Web.
Q. Has your online business been profitable
financially?
A. I continue to break even, and am able to
upgrade hardware and software regularly. I
rarely raise my rates because my skills seem best
suited to the small business community, and I
want to offer a fee these people can afford.
Q. Who creates your business’s Web pages?
A. Basic design is done by a Web designer, and
I take over from there. I want the ability to make
extensive and frequent changes in text and
design. I do hire someone to format my ezine
pages, graphics, and programming.
Q. What advice would you give to someone
starting an online business?
A. I have a bunch of suggestions to give, based
on my own experience:
 Network. Network with small business
people who have complementary businesses
and with those who have similar businesses.
Also, network by joining professional associ-
ations participating in the activities. Volunteer
time and expertise. Link to these organiza-
tions from your site.
 Join newsgroups and forums. Study neti-
quette first. Lurk until you can adequately
answer a question or make a comment. Also,
keep on the lookout for someone with whom
you can build up a relationship, someone
who might mentor you and be willing to occa-
sionally scrutinize your site, a news release,
and so on. This person must be brutally
honest, but perhaps you can informally offer
one of your own services in return. 
 Learn Web development and the culture.
Even if you don’t do the actual design, you
have to make decisions on all the offers you
receive regarding how to make money via
affiliate programs, link exchanges, hosts,
Web design software, etc. It’s vital that you
keep active online and make those judg-
ments yourself, unless you thoroughly trust
your Webmaster. Find online discussion lists
that handle all areas of Web development
and keep informed.

151
Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers
 Include a Web page that shows your busi-
ness biography or profile. Mention any vol-
unteer work you do, groups to which you
belong, and anything else you do in and for
the community. You need to paint as clear a
picture as possible in just a few words.
Avoid showcasing your talents and hobbies
on a business site unless they are directly
related to your business.
 In everything you write, speak to your visi-
tors. Use the word “you” as much as possi-
ble. Avoid the words “I,” “we,” and “us.”
You, as a businessperson, are there to con-
nect with your visitors. You can’t give them
eye contact, but you can let them know that
they matter, that they are (in a sense) the
reason for your being there.
 Become known as a specialist in a given
field. Be someone who can always answer
a question or go out and find the answer.
Your aim is to get as many potential clients
or customers to your site as possible, not to
get millions of visitors. Forget numbers and
concentrate on creating a site that grabs
the attention of your target market.
 Get help. If you can’t express yourself well
with words (and/or graphics), and know little
about layout, formatting, etc., hire someone
to help you. You’ll save yourself a lot of grief
if you get a capable, trustworthy editor or
designer.
She concludes: “Don’t start such a business
unless you are passionate about it and willing
to give it some time and an initial investment.
But when you do start, there are resources
everywhere — many of them free — to help
people build their businesses successfully.”
What’s that you say? Wired magazine hasn’t called to do an in-depth inter-
view profiling your entrepreneurial skills? Yahoo! hasn’t graced you with the
coveted “glasses” icon (indicating, in the estimation of Yahoo!’s Web site
reviewers, a cool site worthy of special attention) on one of its long index
pages? Take a hint from what my colleagues and I do when we’re writing 
computer books such as the one you’re reading now: We fire up our e-mail
and dash off messages to anyone who may want to endorse our books: our
mentors, our friends, and people we admire in the industry.
People should endorse your business because they like it, not simply because
you asked for an endorsement. If they have problems with your business setup,
they can be a great source of objective advice on how to improve it. Then, after
you make the improvements, they’re more likely than ever to endorse it.
Satisfied customers are another source of endorsements. Approach your cus-
tomers and ask if they’re willing to provide a quote about how you helped
them. If you don’t yet have satisfied customers, ask one or two people to try
your products or services for free and then, if they’re happy with your wares,
ask permission to use their comments on your site. Your goal is to get a pithy,
positive quote that you can put on your home page or on a page specifically
devoted to quotes from your clients.

Don’t be afraid to knock on the doors of celebrities, too. Send e-mail to an
online reporter or someone prominent in your field and ask for an endorse-
ment. People love to give their opinions and see their names in print. You just
may be pleasantly surprised at how ready they are to help you.
Sharing your expertise
Few things build credibility and ensure return visits like a Web site that pre-
sents “inside” tips and goodies you can’t get anywhere else. The more you
can make your visitors feel that they’re going to find something on your site
that is rare or unique, the more success you’ll have.
Tell what you know. Give people information about your field that they may
not have. Point them to all sorts of different places with links.
Siteinspector.com (www.siteinspector.com) provides many services that
Web site owners can access and use online for free. One utility sends your
business URL to a variety of search engines and indexes. Another evaluates
how highly your site is ranked by the major search services. After you have
designed your pages, added your content, and gone online, check your pages
with a utility such as Doctor HTML. The program costs $350 for a single com-
puter, but the service will analyze a single Web page at a time for free. Go to
www.doctor-html.com/RxHTMLpro/cgi-bin/single.cgi to make sure that
everything on one of your most important pages (such as your home page)
works efficiently.
Inviting Comments from Customers
Quick, inexpensive, and personal: These are three of the most important
advantages that the Web has over traditional printed catalogs. The first two
are obvious pluses. You don’t have to wait for your online catalog to get
printed and distributed. On the Web, your contents are published and avail-
able to your customers right away. Putting a catalog on the Web eliminates
(or, if publishing a catalog on the Web allows you to reduce your print run,
dramatically reduces) the cost of printing, which can result in big savings
for you.
But the fact that online catalogs can be more personal than the printed variety
is perhaps the biggest advantage of all. The personal touch comes from the
Web’s potential for interactivity. Getting your customers to click links makes
them actively involved with your catalog.
152
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Getting positive e-mail feedback
Playing hide and seek is fun when you’re amusing your baby niece, but it’s
not a good way to build a solid base of customers. In fact, providing a way for
your customers to interact with you so that they can reach you quickly may
be the most important part of your Web site.
Add a simple mailto link like this:
Questions? Comments? Send e-mail to: info@mycompany.com
A mailto link gets its name from the HTML command that programmers use to
create it. When visitors click the e-mail address, their e-mail program opens a
new e-mail message window with your e-mail address already entered. That
way, they have only to enter a subject line, type the message, and click Send
to send you their thoughts.
Most Web page creation programs make it easy to create a mailto link. For
example, if you use Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Launch and open the Web page to which you want to add your
e-mail link.
2. Position your mouse arrow and click at the spot on the page where
you want the address to appear.
The convention is to put your e-mail address at or near the bottom of a
Web page. A vertical blinking cursor appears at the location where you
want to insert the address.
3. Choose Insert➪Email Link.
The Insert Email Link dialog box appears.
4. In the Text box, type the text that you want to appear on your Web page.
You don’t have to type your e-mail address; you can also type Webmaster,
Customer Service, or your own name.
5. In the E-Mail box, type your e-mail address.
6. Click OK.
The Insert Email Link dialog box closes, and you return to the
Dreamweaver Document window, where your e-mail link appears
in blue and is underlined to signify that it is a clickable link.
Other editors work similarly but don’t give you a menu command called
Email Link. For example, in World Wide Web Weaver, a shareware program
153
Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

for the Macintosh, you choose Tags➪Mail. A dialog box called Mail Editor
appears. Enter your e-mail address and the text you want to appear as the
highlighted link, and then click OK to add the mailto link to your page.
The drawback to publishing your e-mail address directly on your Web page is
that you’re virtually certain to get unsolicited e-mail messages (commonly
called spam) sent to that address. Hiding your e-mail address behind generic
link text (such as “Webmaster”) may help reduce your chances of attracting
spam.
Web page forms that aren’t off-putting
You don’t have to do much Web surfing before you become intimately
acquainted with how Web page forms work, at least from the standpoint of
someone who has to fill them out in order to sign up for Web hosting or to
download software.
When it comes to creating your own Web site, however, you become con-
scious of how useful forms are as a means of gathering essential marketing
information about your customers. They give your visitors a place to sound
off, ask questions, and generally get involved with your online business.
Be clear and use common sense when creating your order form. Here are some
general guidelines on how to organize your form and what you need to include:
 Make it easy on the customer: Whenever possible, add pull-down menus
with pre-entered options to your form fields (text boxes that visitors use
to enter information). That way, users don’t have to wonder about things
such as whether you want them to spell out a state or use the two-letter
abbreviation.
 Validate the information: You can use a programming language called
JavaScript to ensure that users enter information correctly, that all fields
are completely filled out, and so on. You may have to hire someone to
add the appropriate code to the order form, but it’s worth it to save you
from having to call customers to verify or correct information that they
missed or submitted incorrectly.
 Provide a help number: Give people a number to call if they have ques-
tions or want to check on an order.
 Return an acknowledgment: Let customers know that you have received
their order and will be shipping the merchandise immediately or contact-
ing them if more information is needed.
154
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

As usual, good Web page authoring and editing programs make it a snap to
create the text boxes, check boxes, buttons, and other parts of a form that
the user fills out. The other part of a form, the computer script that receives
the data and processes it so that you can read and use the information, is not
as simple. See Chapter 13 for details.
Not so long ago, you had to write or edit a scary CGI script in order to set up
forms processing on your Web site. A new alternative recently turned up that
makes the process of creating a working Web page form accessible to non-
programmers like the rest of us. Web businesses, such as Response-O-Matic
(www.response-o-matic.com) and FormMail.To (www.formmail.to), will
lead you through the process of setting up a form and providing you with the
CGI script that receives the data and forwards it to you.
Providing a guestbook
The basic idea of a guestbook is not all that new and exciting. You probably
have gone to plenty of special events where they ask you to sign in and write
a little something about the guests of honor or the place where the party is
being held. But a guestbook on your Web site can add a whole other dimen-
sion to your business by making your customers feel that they are part of a
thriving community. When you provide a guestbook on one of your business’s
Web pages, your clients and other visitors can check out who else has been
there and what others think about the site.
If you set out to create your own Web page guestbook from scratch, you’d have
to create a form, write a script (fairly complicated code that tells a computer
what to do), test the code, and so on. Thankfully, an easier way to add a guest-
book is available: You simply register with a special Web business that provides
free guestbooks to users. One such organization, Lycos, offers a guestbook ser-
vice through its Html Gear site (htmlgear.lycos.com/specs/guest.html).
If you register with Html Gear’s service, you can have your own guestbook
right away with no fuss. (Actually, Html Gear’s guestbook program resides on
one of its Web servers; you just add the text-entry portion to your own page.)
Here’s how to do it:
1. Connect to the Internet, start up your Web browser, and go to 
htmlgear.lycos.com/specs/guest.html.
2. Scroll down the page and click the Get this Gear! link.
You go to the Network Membership page.
155
Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

3. Click the Sign Me Up! button and follow the instructions on subse-
quent pages to register for the guestbook and other software on the
Html Gear site.
The program asks you to provide your own personal information, choose
a name and password for your guestbook, enter the URL of the Web page
on which you want the guestbook to appear, and provide keywords that
describe your page.
4. After you’ve registered, a page entitled Gear Manager appears. Click
Add Gear and then Get Gear next to Guest Gear. 
After a few seconds, a page called Create Guest Gear appears. This page
contains a form that you need to fill out in order to create the guestbook
text-entry fields (the text boxes and other items that visitors use to
submit information to you) to your Web page.
5. Fill out the Create Guest Gear form.
The form lets you name your guestbook and customize how you want vis-
itors to interact with you. For instance, you can configure the guestbook
to send you an e-mail notification whenever someone posts a message.
6. When you’re done filling out the form, click Save & Create.
The Get Code page appears. A box contains the code you need to copy
and add to the HTML for your Web page.
7. Position your mouse arrow at the beginning of the code (just before
the first line, which looks like this: <!-- \/ GuestGEAR Code by
http://htmlgear.com \/ ->), press and hold down your mouse
button, and scroll across the code to the last line, which reads: 
<!-- /\ End GuestGEAR Code /\ -->.
The code is highlighted to show that it has been selected.
8. Choose Edit➪Copy to copy the selected code to your computer’s
Clipboard.
9. Launch your Web editor, if it isn’t running already, and open the Web
page you want to edit in your Web editor window.
If you’re working in a program (such as Dreamweaver or HotDog Pro)
that shows the HTML for a Web page while you edit it, you can move on
to Step 10. If, on the other hand, your editor hides the HTML from you,
you have to use your editor’s menu options to view the HTML source for
your page. The exact menu command varies from program to program.
Usually, though, the option is contained in the View menu. In FrontPage,
for example, you click the HTML tab at the bottom of the window. The
HTML for the Web page you want to edit then appears.
10. Scroll down and click the spot on the page where you want to paste
the HTML code for the guestbook.
156
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

How do you know where this spot is? Well, you have to add the code
in the BODY section of a Web page. This is the part of the page that is
contained between two HTML tags, <BODY> and </BODY>. You can’t go
wrong with pasting the code just before the </BODY> tag — or just
before your return e-mail address or any other material you want to
keep at the bottom of the page. The following example indicates the
proper placement for the guestbook code:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Sign My Guestbook</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
The body of your Web page goes here; this is the part
that appears on the Web.
Paste your guestbook code here!
</BODY>
</HTML>
11. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The guestbook code is added to your page.
12. Close your Web editor’s HTML window.
Exactly how you do this varies depending on the program. If you have a
separate HTML window open, click the close box (X) in the upper-right
corner of the HTML window, if you are working in a Windows environ-
ment. (If you’re working on a Mac, close the window by clicking the close
box in the upper-left corner of the window that displays the HTML.)
The HTML code disappears, and you return to your Web editor’s main
window.
13. Choose File➪Save to save your changes.
14. Preview your work in your Web browser window.
The steps involved in previewing also vary from editor to editor. Some
editors have a Preview toolbar button that you click to view your page
in a Web browser. Otherwise, launch your Web browser to preview your
page as follows:
• If you use Netscape Navigator, choose File➪Open Page, click the
name of the file you just saved in the Open Page dialog box, and
then click Open to open the page.
• If you use Internet Explorer, choose File➪Open, click the name of
the file you just saved in the Open dialog box, and then click Open
to open the page.
The page opens in your Web browser, with a new Guestbook button
added to it, as shown in Figure 6-6.
157
Chapter 6: Attracting and Keeping Customers

Now, when visitors to your Web page click the Sign My Guestbook link, they go
to a page that has a form they can fill out. Clicking the View My Guestbook
link enables visitors to view the messages that other visitors have entered
into your guestbook.
The problem with adding a link to a service that resides on another Web site
is that it makes your Web pages load more slowly. First, your visitor’s browser
loads the text on your page. Then it loads the images from top to bottom.
Besides this, it has to make a link to the Html Gear site in order to load the
guestbook. If you decide to add a guestbook, images, or other elements that
reside on another Web site, be sure to test your page and make sure that you’re
satisfied with how long the contents take to appear. Also make sure to use the
“Moderation” feature that enables you to screen postings to your guestbook.
That way, you can delete obscene, unfair, or libelous postings before they go
online.
Chit-chat that counts
You’ve accomplished a lot by the time you’ve put your business online.
Hopefully, you’re already seeing the fruits of your labors in the form of e-mail
inquiries and orders for your products or services.
That’s all good, but this is no time to rest on your laurels. After visitors start
coming to your site, the next step is to retain those visitors. A good way to do
this is by building a sense of community by posting a bulletin-board-type dis-
cussion area.
A discussion area takes the form of back-and-forth messages on topics of
mutual interest. Each person can read previously posted messages and either
respond or start a new topic of discussion. For an example of a discussion area
that’s tied to an online business, visit the Australian Fishing (www.ausfish.
com.au) discussion areas, one of which is shown in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-6:
Add a
guestbook
link to your
Web page.
158
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

The talk doesn’t have to be about your own particular niche in your business
field. In fact, the discussion will be more lively if your visitors can discuss
concerns about your area of business in general, whether it’s flower arrang-
ing, boat sales, tax preparation, clock repair, computers, or whatever.
How, exactly, do you start a discussion area? The basic first step is to
install a special computer script on the computer that hosts your Web site.
(Again, discussing this prospect with your Web hosting service beforehand
is essential.) When visitors come to your site, their Web browsers access the
script, enabling them to enter comments and read other messages.
Here are some specific ways to prepare a discussion area for your site:
 Install Microsoft FrontPage, which includes the scripts you need to start
a discussion group. You can’t download a trial version; you have to buy
the software for $199.
www.microsoft.com/office/frontpage/howtobuy/default.mspx
 Copy a bulletin board or discussion-group script from either of these sites:
• Extropia.com (www.extropia.com/applications.html)
• Matt’s Script Archive (www.worldwidemart.com/scripts)

 Start your own forum on a service such as HyperNews, by Daniel
LaLiberte, or install the HyperNews program yourself.

Because chat rooms and discussion groups are for a more advanced business
Web site, I don’t discuss them in detail in this book. If you want to find out
more, please refer to my book Small Business Internet For Dummies (Wiley).

Building in Security Up Front
In This Chapter
 Protecting data through passwords and backups
 Boosting security with a firewall
 Using Secure Sockets Layer encryption
 Keeping out Trojan horses and other malicious code
 Making your e-mail communications secure
W
hether the perceived threat is from foreign terrorists or roving gangs
of teenage hoodlums, everyone seems to be on heightened security
alert these days. And when you’re an online businessperson, you face some
real concerns that involve your own equipment and data as well as the welfare
of your clients. The whole idea of security can seem intimidating. After all, you
need to protect your business from the viruses and other hack attacks that
are proliferating along with the always-on broadband Internet connections,
which are especially vulnerable to these intrusions. Fortunately, there are
some down-to-earth measures you can take, most of which involve nothing
more than good old common sense. You don’t need to spend lots of money
to make your information and that of your all-important customers secure. 
In this chapter, I discuss some technologies and strategies that can keep
your data secure. Some of these measures are easy to put into practice and
especially important for home-based businesspeople. Others are technically
challenging to implement on your own. But even if you have your Web host
or a consultant do the work, it’s good to familiarize yourself with Internet
security schemes. Doing so gives you the ability to make informed decisions
about how to protect your online data. You can then take steps to lock your
virtual doors so you don’t have to worry that your cyberstock is easy pick-
ings for hackers and other boogeymen.

Practicing Safe Business
I’m not about to suggest that you buy a gun or even a guard dog to protect
your home office. Yet I do need in good conscience to point out that working
at home carries its own set of safety concerns for small-business owners.
Luckily, these concerns tend to be easy to address. Safe computing practices,
such as using password protection, making backups, and installing antivirus
software, can go a long way toward keeping your data secure, even if you never
have to get into more technical subjects such as public-key encryption.
When you sleep where you work
Traffic in my city has gone from bad to worse, and I remind myself every
morning as I’m working on my laptop while sitting on my back porch in my
pajamas how lucky I am to not have to commute. Yet I’m constantly fielding
phone calls from parents of the friends of my children as well as nonprofit
groups that I support who assume that because I’m home I have the whole
day free to do as I please. So, knowing all too well that it’s easier said than
done, here are some simple steps that can help you set more clearly defined
boundaries between work and domestic life, even when it all happens under
the same roof. 
When the computer is a group sport
Even if you’re of a certain age, it’s probably hard to comprehend that not so
very long ago, there was one telephone per household and even that was
connected to a party line shared by a number of other families. Now every-
one in my family, at least, thinks they are entitled to their own computers.
We haven’t reached that level of paradise yet, but there is a lot to be said for
having at least two separate machines — one for personal use and one for
business use. The idea is that you set up your system so that you have to
log on to your business computer with a username and password. (For sug-
gestions on how to devise a good password that’s difficult to crack, see the
section, “Picking passwords that are hard to guess,” later in this chapter.)
If you have only one computer, passwords can still provide a measure of pro-
tection. Windows gives you the ability to set up different user profiles, each
associated with its own password. You can assign a different profile to each
member of your family. You can even make a game out of selecting profiles:
Each person can pick his or her own background color and desktop arrange-
ment for Windows. User profiles and passwords don’t necessarily protect your
business files, but they convey to your family members that they should use
their own software, stick to their own directories, and not try to explore your
company data.
162
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

You can also set up different user profiles for your copy of Netscape
Communicator. That way, your kids won’t receive your business e-mail while
they’re surfing the Internet because you’ll have different e-mail inboxes. If
you’re on Windows, choose Start➪Programs➪Netscape Communicator➪

Back to the topic of telephones, even a thrifty guy like me considers it to be a
necessity, not a luxury, to get a separate phone line for business use (even if
it’s your cell phone rather than a land line). Having a devoted phone line not
only makes your business seem more serious but also separates your business
calls from your personal calls. Additionally, if you need a phone line to con-
nect to the Net, you then have a choice of which line to use for your modem.
The next step is to set up your business phone with its own answering machine
or voice mail. On your business voice mail, identify yourself with your busi-
ness’s name. This arrangement builds credibility and makes you feel like a
real business owner. You can then install privacy features, such as caller ID,
on your business line as needed.
Even though I’ve resigned myself to paying for multiple phone lines, I’m still
constantly on the lookout for the best deal possible. One place I go to for tips
and news on telephone service, not only for small businesses but also for per-
sonal use, is the Telecommunications Research & Action Center (www.trac.
org). This site provides suggestions of ways to cut your phone bills and make
smart decisions on telephone service.
Preparing for the worst
There’s an old joke about the telegram from a mother that read, “Worry. Details
to follow.” When you’re lying awake at night, you can be anxious about all sorts
of grim disasters: flood, fire, theft, computer virus, you name it. Prevention is
always better than cure, so this chapter covers steps you can take to prevent
problems. But, should a problem arise, there are also ways to recover more
easily.

Insurance . . . the least you can do
I can think of ways to spend money that are a whole lot more fun than paying
insurance premiums. Yet there I am every month, writing checks to protect
myself in case something goes wrong with my house, car, body, and so on. And
yes, there’s another item to add to the list: protecting my business investment
by obtaining insurance that specifically covers me against hardware damage,
theft, and loss of data. You can also go a step further and obtain a policy that
covers the cost of data entry or equipment rental that would be necessary to
recover your business information. Here are some specific strategies:
 Make a list of all your hardware and software and how much each item
cost, and store a copy of it in a place such as a fireproof safe or safe-
deposit box.
 Take photos of your computer setup in case you need to make an insur-
ance claim and put them in the same safe place.
 Save your electronic files on CD or DVD and put the disc in a safe storage
location, such as a safe-deposit box. 
Investigate the many options available to you for insuring your computer
hardware and software. Your current homeowner’s or renter’s insurance may
offer coverage, but make sure the dollar amount is sufficient for replacement.
You may also want to look into the computer hardware and software coverage
provided by Safeware, The Insurance Agency, Inc. (www.safeware.com).
Think ahead to the unthinkable
The Gartner Group estimates that two out of five businesses that experience a
major disaster will go out of business within five years. I would guess that the
three that are able to get back up on their feet and running quickly are those
that already had recovery plans in place. Even if your company is small, you
need to be prepared for big trouble — not only for terrorist attacks, but nat-
ural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes. A recovery effort
might include the following strategies:
 Backup power systems: What will you do if the power goes out and you
can’t access the Web? Consider a battery backup system such as APC
Back-UPS Office (www.apc.com/products/back-ups_office/index.
cfm). It instantly switches your computers to battery power when the
electricity goes out so you can save your data and switch to laptops. A
version that runs for five to ten minutes costs $59.99. Even more impor-
tant, make sure that your ISP or Web host has a backup power supply so
that your store can remain online in case of a power outage.
 Data storage: This is probably the most practical and essential disaster
recovery step for small or home-based businesses. Back up your files on
a computer that’s not located in the place where you physically work. At
the very least, upload your files periodically to the Web space that your
hosting service gives you. Also consider storing your files with an online
164
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

storage service. (See the section on online storage space in this book’s
Internet Directory for suggestions, including one free storage option.) 
 Telecommunications: Having some alternate method of communication
available in case your phone system goes down ensures that you’re
always in touch. The obvious choice is a cell phone. Also set up a voice
mailbox so that customers and vendors can leave messages for you even
if you can’t answer the phone.
Creating a plan is a waste of time if you don’t regularly set aside time to keep
it up to date. Back up your data on a regular basis, purchase additional equip-
ment if you need it, and make arrangements to use other computers and
offices if you need to — in other words, implement your plan. You owe it not
only to yourself but also to your customers to be prepared in case of disaster.

Low- and high-tech locks
If you play the word game with a Web surfer or
Web site and say “security,” you’re likely to get
a response such as “encryption.” But security
doesn’t need to start with software. The fact is,
all the firewalls and passwords in the world
won’t help you if someone breaks into your
home office and trashes or makes off with the
computer that contains all your files.
Besides insuring your computer equipment and
taking photos in case you need to get it replaced,
you can also invest in locks for your home office
and your machines. They might not keep some-
one from breaking into your house, but they’ll at
least make it more difficult for intruders to carry
off your hardware.
Here are some suggestions for how to protect
your hardware and the business data your com-
puters contain:
 Lock your office: Everyone has locks on the
outer doors of their house, but go a step fur-
ther and install a deadbolt lock on your
office door. 
 Lock your computers: Innovative Security
Products (www.wesecure.com) offers
several varieties of computer locking sys-
tems. They also sell ultraviolet pens that you
can use to mark your equipment with your
name and the serial number of your com-
puter in case the police recover it.
 Mark your modem: Unbeknownst to some-
one who’s up to no good, an innovative theft
recovery system called CompuTrace can be
installed on your hard drive. Then, if your
computer is stolen, the software is acti-
vated. When the thief connects its internal
modem to a phone line, the authorities are
notified. The system works with other types
of Internet connections as well, including
DSL and cable modems. CompuTrace Plus
(www.computrace.com) is offered by
Absolute Software Corp. and costs home
office users $49.95 for one year of monitoring.
 Make backups: Be sure to regularly back up
your information on Zip drives or similar stor-
age devices. Also consider signing up with a
Web-based storage service where files can
be transferred from your computer. That way,
if your computers and your extra storage
disks are lost for whatever reason, you’ll
have an online backup in a secure location.
Look into @Backup (www.atbackup.com),
which will give you 100MB of storage space
for $99 per year.

Antivirus protection without a needle
ISCA Labs (www.icsalabs.com/html/communities/antivirus/alerts.
shtml), which keeps track of viruses circulating around the Internet, has 
estimated that as many as 20,000 viruses are present online at any one time.
As an online businessperson, you’re going to be downloading files, receiving
disks from customers and vendors, and exchanging e-mail with all sorts of
people you’ve never met before. Surf safely by installing antivirus programs
such as
 Norton Internet Security by Symantec Corporation (www.symantec.
com/product): This application, which includes an antivirus program
and a firewall and lists for $69.95, automates many security functions and
is especially good for beginners. A standalone version, Norton Anti-Virus,
is available for $49.95, but I highly recommend the more full-featured
package, which includes a firewall that will block many other dangerous
types of intrusions such as Trojan horses. 
 AVG AntiVirus by GriSoft (www.grisoft.com): Many users who find
Norton Internet Security too intrusive (it leaves lots of files on your com-
puter and consumes a great deal of memory) turn to this product, which
comes in a free version as well as a more full-featured version for $33.30. 
 AntiVir Personal Edition by H+BEDV (www.free-av.de): Another pop-
ular free program. The program’s home page is in German, which may
turn off U.S. users.
 VirusScan by McAfee (www.mcafee.com/us): This is the leading com-
petitor to Norton Anti-Virus, which comes bundled with Norton Internet
Security. A version called VirusScan ASaP for small businesses costs
$40.80. VirusScan is included in McAfee Internet Security, which includes
a firewall and costs $49.99.
This is another area that demands your attention on a regular basis. Viruses
change all the time, and new ones appear regularly. The antivirus program
you install one day may not be able to handle the viruses that appear just a
few weeks or months later. You may want to pick an antivirus program that
doesn’t charge excessive amounts for regular updates (for instance, you have
to pay for a new version every year, as Norton Internet Security does). Also
check the ICSA’s monthly antivirus Product Testing Reports (www.icsalabs.
com/html/communities/antivirus/labs.shtml).
A visible sign that you’re trustworthy
Like the office assistant whose work is visible only when he or she is not doing
a good job, you may be squeaky clean but nobody will know unless there’s a
problem . . . or unless you display a seal from TRUSTe. This nonprofit organi-
zation is seeking to boost the degree of trust that Web surfers have in the
Internet. It does this through a third-party oversight “seal” program. If you
166
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

demonstrate to TRUSTe that you’re making efforts to keep your visitors’ per-
sonal data secure, and if you pledge not to share your customers’ data and to
publish a privacy statement on your site, TRUSTe issues you a seal of approval
that you can place on your site’s home page. The TRUSTe seal is intended to
function as the online equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal of approval
on a product.
By itself, the seal doesn’t keep hackers from breaking into your site and steal-
ing your data. That’s still up to you. Having the seal just makes visitors feel
better about using your services. The TRUSTe site provides you with a wizard
that leads you through the process of generating a privacy statement for your
site. The statement tells visitors how you will protect their information. Find
out more by visiting the TRUSTe home page (www.truste.org) and clicking
the For Businesses link.
I love gadgets, and few things get me more excited than hand-held devices,
laptops, and other portable computing devices. Yet those are the items that
I seem to have the most trouble keeping track of, literally and figuratively.
At the very least, you should make the device’s storage area accessible with
a password. You can also install protection software designed especially for
mobile devices, such as VirusScan PDA by McAfee (www.mcafee.com/myapps/
vsw/default.asp).
Installing Firewalls and Other Safeguards
You probably know how important a firewall is in a personal sense. It filters
out unwanted intrusions such as executable programs that hackers seek to
plant on your file system so they can use your computer for their own pur-
poses. When you’re starting an online business, the objectives of a firewall
become different: You’re protecting not just your own information but also that
of your customers. In other words, you’re quite possibly relying on the fire-
wall to protect your source of income as well as the data on your computers. 
Just what is a firewall, exactly? A firewall is an application or hardware device
that monitors the data flowing into or out of a computer network and that filters
the data based on criteria that the owner sets up. Like a security guard at the
entrance to an apartment building, a firewall scans the packets (small, uniform
data segments) of digital information that traverse the Internet, making sure
the data is headed for the right destination and that it doesn’t match known
characteristics of viruses or attacks. Authorized traffic is allowed into your
network. Attack attempts or viruses are either automatically deleted or cause
an alert message to appear to which you must respond with a decision to
block or allow the incoming or outgoing packets.
167
Chapter 7: Building in Security Upfront

Keeping out Trojan horses and 
other unwanted visitors
A Trojan horse is a program that enters your computer surreptitiously and
then attempts to do something without your knowledge. Some folks say that
such programs enter your system through a “backdoor” because you don’t
immediately know that they’ve entered your system. Trojan horses may
come in the form of an e-mail attachment with the filename extension .exe
(which stands for executable). For instance, I recently received an e-mail that
purported to be from Microsoft Corporation and that claimed it contained a
security update. The attachment looked innocent enough, but had I saved the
attachment to my computer, it would have used my computer as a staging
area for distributing itself to many other e-mail addresses.
I didn’t run into trouble, however. A special firewall program I installed, called
Norton Internet Security, recognized the attachment and alerted me to the
danger. I highly recommend that anyone who, like me, has a cable modem, DSL,
or other direct connection to the Internet install one right away. You can try
out a shareware program called ZoneAlarm by Zone Labs, Inc. (www.zone
alarm.com) that provides you with basic firewall protection, though more full-
featured programs like Norton Internet Security (www.symantec.com/product)
will probably be more effective.
Cleaning out spyware
You’ve also got to watch out for software that “spies” on your Web surfing and
other activities and that reports them back to advertisers, potentially invading
your privacy. Ad-Aware isn’t a firewall, exactly, but it’s a useful program that
detects and erases any advertising programs you may have downloaded from
the Internet without knowing it. Such advertising programs might be running
on your computer, consuming your processing resources and slowing down
operations. Some “spyware” programs track your activities as you surf the
Web; others simply report that they have been installed. Many users regard
these spyware programs as invasions of privacy because they install them-
selves and do their reporting without your asking for it or even knowing
they’re active.
When I ran Ad-Aware the first time, it detected a whopping 57 programs I
didn’t know about that were running on my computer and that had installed
themselves when I connected to various Web sites or downloaded software.
As you can see in Figure 7-1, when I ran Ad-Aware while I was working on this
chapter, sure enough, it found four suspicious software components running.
I highly recommend Ad-Aware; you can download a version at www.lava
softUSA.com and try it for free. If you decide to keep it, you pay a $15 share-
ware fee.
168
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Positioning the firewall
These days, most home networks are configured so that the computers on
the network can share information as well as the same Internet connection.
Whether you run a home-based business or a business in a discrete location,
you almost certainly have a network of multiple computers. A network is far
more vulnerable than a single computer connected to the Internet: A network
has more entry points than a single computer, and more reliance is placed on
each of the operators of those computers to observe good safety practices.
And if one computer on the network is attacked, there is the real potential for
the others to be attacked as well. 
You probably are acquainted with software firewalls such as Norton Personal
Firewall or McAfee Firewall (www.mcafee.com/myapps/firewall/ov_
firewall.asp). Software firewalls protect one computer at a time. In a typi-
cal business scenario, however, multiple computers share a single Internet
connection through a router that functions as a gateway. Many network
administrators prefer a hardware firewall — a device that functions as a filter
for traffic both entering and leaving it. A hardware firewall may also function
as a router, but it can also be separate from the router. The device is positioned
at the perimeter of the network where it can protect all the company’s comput-
ers at once. Examples of hardware are the Cisco PIX line (one example, which
costs about $350, is at www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/vpndevc/
ps2030/ps2031/index.html), and the WatchGuard Firebox SOHO 6tc,
which costs about $279, by WatchGuard (www.watchguard.com). 
Companies that want to provide a Web site that the public can visit as 
well as secure e-mail and other communications services create a secure 
sub-network of one or more specially hardened (in other words, secured
because all unnecessary services have been removed from them) computers.
This kind of network is called a Demilitarized Zone or DMZ.

Chapter 7: Building in Security Upfront

Keeping your firewall up to date
Firewalls work by means of attack signatures (also called definitions), which
are sets of data that identify a connection attempt as a potential attack. Some
attacks are easy to stop: They have been attempted for years and the amateur
hackers who attempt intrusions don’t give much thought to them. The more
dangerous attacks are new ones. They have signatures that have emerged
since you installed your firewall. 
You quickly get a dose of reality and find just how serious the problem is by
visiting one of the Web sites that keeps track of the latest attacks such as the
Distributed Intrusion Detection System or DShield (www.dshield.org). On
the day I visited, DShield reported that the “survival time” for an unpatched
computer (a computer that has security software that has not been equipped
with the latest updates called patches) after connecting it to the Internet was
only 16 minutes. That means such a computer only has 16 minutes before
someone tries to attack it. If that doesn’t scare you into updating your secu-
rity software, I don’t know what will. 
Public Keys That Provide Security
The conversations I overhear as I drive my preteen daughters and their friends
to events leave no doubt in my mind that different segments of society use
code words that only their members can understand. Even computers use
encoding and decoding to protect information they exchange on the Internet.
The schemes used online are far more complex and subtle than the slang
used by kids, however. This section describes the security method that is
used most widely on the Internet, and the one you’re likely to use yourself:
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.
The keys to public-key/private-key 
encryption
Terms like SSL and encryption might make you want to reach for the remote.
But don’t be too quick to switch channels. SSL is making it safer to do busi-
ness online and boosting the trust of potential customers. And anything that
makes shoppers more likely to spend money online is something you need to
know about.
170
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

The term encryption refers to the process of encoding data, especially sensitive
data, such as credit card numbers. Information is encrypted by means of com-
plex mathematical formulas called algorithms. Such a formula may transform
a simple-looking bit of information into a huge block of seemingly incompre-
hensible numbers, letters, and characters. Only someone who has the right
formula, called a key, which is itself a complex mass of encoded data, can
decode the gobbledygook.
Here’s a very simple example. Suppose that my credit card number is 12345
and I encode it by using an encryption formula into something like the follow-
ing: 1aFgHx203gX4gLu5cy.
The algorithm that generated this encrypted information may say something
like: “Take the first number, multiply it by some numeral, and then add some
letters to it. Then take the second number, divide it by x, and add y characters
to the result,” and so on. (In reality, the formulas are far more complex than
this, which is why you usually have to pay a license fee to use them. But this
is the general idea.) Someone who has the same formula can run it in reverse,
so to speak, in order to decrypt the encoded number and obtain the original
number, 12345.
In practice, the encoded numbers that are generated by encryption routines
and transmitted on the Internet are very large. They vary in size depending
on the relative strength (or uncrackability) of the security method being
used. Some methods generate keys that consist of 128 bits of data; a data bit
is a single unit of digital information. These formulas are called 128-bit keys.
Encryption is the cornerstone of security on the Internet. The most widely
used security schemes, such as the Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL), the
Secure Electronic Transactions protocol (SET), and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP),
all use some form of encryption.
With some security methods, the party that sends the data and the party that
receives it both use the same key (this method is called symmetrical encryption).
This approach isn’t considered as secure as an asymmetrical encryption
method, such as public-key encryption, however. In public-key encryption, the
originating party obtains a license to use a security method. (In the following
section, I show you just how to do this yourself.) As part of the license, you use
the encryption algorithm to generate your own private key. You never share
this key with anyone. However, you use the private key to create a separate
public key. This public key goes out to visitors who connect to a secure area
of your Web site. As soon as they have your public key, users can encode sen-
sitive information and send it back to you. Only you can decode the data —
by using your secret, private key.

Getting a certificate without 
going to school
When you write a check at the grocery store, the cashier is likely to make
sure you are preregistered as an approved member and also ask to see your
driver’s license. But on the Internet, how do you know that people are who
they say they are when all you have to go on is a URL or an e-mail address?
The solution in the online world is to obtain a personal certificate that you
can send to Web site visitors or append to your e-mail messages.
How certificates work
A certificate, which is also sometimes called a Digital ID, is an electronic docu-
ment issued by a certification authority (CA). The certificate contains the
owner’s personal information as well as a public key that can be exchanged
with others online. The public key is generated by the owner’s private key,
which the owner obtains during the process of applying for the certificate.
In issuing the certificate, the CA takes responsibility for saying that the owner
of the document is the same as the person actually identified on the certifi-
cate. Although the public key helps establish the owner’s identity, certificates
do require you to put a level of trust in the agency that issues it.
A certificate helps both you and your customers. A certificate assures your
customers that you’re the person you say you are, plus it protects your e-mail
communications by enabling you to encrypt them.
Obtaining a certificate from VeriSign
Considering how important a role certificates play in online security, it’s
remarkably easy to obtain one. You do so by applying and paying a licensing
fee to a CA. One of the most popular CAs is VeriSign, Inc., which lets you apply
for a certificate called a Class 1 Digital ID.
A Class 1 Digital ID is only useful for securing personal communications. As an
e-commerce Web site owner, you may want a business-class certificate called
a 128-bit SSL Global Server ID (www.verisign.com/products/site). This
form of Digital ID works only if your e-commerce site is hosted on a server
that runs secure server software — software that encrypts transactions —
such as Apache Stronghold. Check with your Web host to see if a secure
server is available for your Web site.
A VeriSign personal certificate, which you can use to authenticate yourself
in e-mail, news, and other interactions on the Net, costs $14.95 per year, and
you can try out a free certificate for 60 days. Follow these steps to obtain
your Digital ID:
1. Go to the VeriSign, Inc. Digital IDs for Secure E-Mail page at
172
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

www.verisign.com/products-services/security-
services/pki/pki-application/email-digital-
id/index.html
2. Click the Buy Now button whether you’re certain you want an ID or if
you only want the trial version. 
The Digital ID Enrollment page appears.
3. Click Buy Now near the bottom of the page.
A page may appear (if you don’t have JavaScript support) that asks you
to identify the Web browser you use most often, and that you want to
associate with the Digital ID. Click the browser you want. An application
form for a Digital ID appears.
4. Complete the application form.
The application process is pretty simple. The form asks for your personal
information and a challenge phrase that you can use in case anyone is
trying to impersonate you. It also requires you to accept a license agree-
ment. (You don’t need to enter credit card information if you select the
60-day trial option.)
5. Click the Accept button at the bottom of the screen.
A dialog box appears asking you to confirm your e-mail address. After
you confirm by clicking OK, a dialog box appears asking you to choose a
password. When you enter a password and click OK, VeriSign uses your
password to generate a private key for you. The private key is an essen-
tial ingredient in public-key/private-key technology.
6. Click OK to have your browser generate your private key.
A page appears asking you to check your e-mail for further instructions.
In a few minutes, you receive a message that contains a Digital ID PIN.
7. In your e-mail program, open the new message from VeriSign Customer
Support Department.
8. Use your mouse to highlight (select) the PIN, and then choose Edit➪
Copy to copy the PIN.
9. Go to the URL for Digital ID Services that’s included in the e-mail mes-
sage and paste your PIN in the text box next to Enter the Digital ID
Personal Identification Number (PIN).
10. Click Submit.
The certificate is generated, and the Digital IDF Installation and
Registration Page appears.
11. Click the Install button.
The ID from VeriSign downloads, and you’re now able to view it with your
browser. Figure 7-2 shows my certificate for Netscape Navigator. (Copying
this ID, or anyone else’s, is pointless because this is only your public key;
the public key is always submitted with your private key, which is secret.)
173
Chapter 7: Building in Security Upfront

After you have your Digital ID, what do you do with it? For one thing, you
can use it to verify your identity to sites that accept certificate submissions.
Some sites that require members to log in use secure servers that give you
the option of submitting your certificate rather than entering the usual user-
name and password to identify yourself. You can also attach your Digital ID to
your e-mail messages to prove that your message is indeed coming from you.
See your e-mail program’s Help files for more specific instructions.
You can’t encrypt or digitally sign messages on any computer other than the
one to which your certificates are issued. If you’re using a different computer
than the one you used when you obtained your certificates, you must contact
your certificate issuer and obtain a new certificate for the computer you’re
now using. Or, if your browser allows transfers, you can export your certifi-
cate to the new computer.
Keeping Other Noses Out 
of Your Business
Encryption isn’t just for big businesses. Individuals who want to maintain their
privacy, even while navigating the wilds of the Internet, can install special
software or modify their existing e-mail programs in order to encode their
online communications.
The Cyberangels Web site (www.cyberangels.org) presents some good tips
and strategies for personal protection on the Internet.

Encryption software for the rest of us
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a popular encryption program, has been around
about as long as the Web itself. PGP lets you protect the privacy of your e-mail
messages and file attachments by encrypting them so that only those with the
proper authority can decipher the information. You can also digitally sign the
messages and files you exchange, which assures the recipient that the mes-
sages come from you and that the information has not been tampered with.
You can even encrypt files on your own computer, too.
PGP (web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html) is a freely available personal encryp-
tion program. PGP is a plug-in, an application that works with another program
to provide added functionality. You can integrate the program with popular
e-mail programs such as Eudora and Microsoft Outlook (although Netscape
Messenger is notably absent from the list of supported applications).
In order to use either the free version of PGP or another, commercial version
called PGP Personal Privacy, the first step is to obtain and install the program.
After you install the program, you can use it to generate your own private-key/
public-key pair. After you create a key pair, you can begin exchanging encrypted
e-mail messages with other PGP users. To do so, you need to obtain a copy of
their public keys, and they need a copy of your public key. Because public keys
are just blocks of text, trading keys with someone is really quite easy. You can
include your public key in an e-mail message, copy it to a file, or post it on a
public-key server where anyone can get a copy at any time.
After you have a copy of someone’s public key, you can add it to your public
keyring, which is a file on your own computer. Then you can begin to exchange
encrypted and signed messages with that individual. If you’re using an e-mail
application supported by the PGP plug-ins, you can encrypt and sign your mes-
sages by selecting the appropriate options from your application’s toolbar.
If your e-mail program doesn’t have a plug-in, you can copy your e-mail mes-
sage to your computer’s Clipboard and encrypt it there by using PGP built-in
functions. See the PGP User’s Guide files for more specific instructions.
The freeware version of PGP is distributed freely by MIT with the approval of
Network Associates, which owns the rights to PGP encryption technology and
has incorporated it into a variety of commercial security products. A com-
mercial product called PGP Personal Privacy is still being sold by McAfee for
$49.95 but is no longer being actively marketed. The freeware version of PGP

Encrypting e-mail messages
You can use your existing software to encrypt your mail messages rather
than have to install a separate program such as PGP. In the following sec-
tions, I describe the steps involved in setting up the e-mail programs that
come with the Big Two browser packages, Microsoft Internet Explorer and
Netscape Communicator, to encrypt your messages.
If you use Outlook Express, you can use your Digital ID to do the following:
 Send a digital signature: You can digitally shrink-wrap your e-mail mes-
sage by using your certificate in order to assure the recipient that the
message is really from you.
 Encrypt your message: You can digitally encode a message to ensure
that only the intended party can read it.
To better understand the technical details of how you can keep your e-mail
communications secure, read the Digital ID User Guide, which you can
access at
www.verisign.com/stellent/groups/public/documents/guides/
005326.pdf
After you have a digital ID, in order to actually make use of it, you need to
follow these steps (these steps apply to Internet Explorer):
1. After you obtain your own Digital ID, the first step is to associate it
with your e-mail account. Select Tools➪Accounts.
The Internet Accounts dialog box appears.
2. Select your e-mail account and click Properties.
The Properties dialog box for your e-mail account appears.
3. Click the Security tab to bring it to the front.
4. Click the Select button in the Signing Certificate section; then when
the Select Default Account Digital ID dialog box appears, select your
Digital ID.
5. Click OK to close the Select Default Account Digital ID dialog box;
then click OK to close the Properties dialog box, and click Close to
close the Internet Accounts dialog box.
176
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

You return to the main Outlook Express window.
6. To send a digitally signed e-mail message to someone, click Create
Message.
The New Message dialog box appears.
7. Click either or both of the security buttons at the extreme right of the
toolbar, as shown in Figure 7-3.
The Sign button enables you to add your Digital ID. The Encrypt button
lets you encrypt your message.
8. Finish writing your message and then click the Send button.
Your encrypted or digitally signed message is sent on its way.
The preceding steps show you how to digitally sign or encrypt an individual
message. You have to follow these steps every time you want to sign or
encrypt a message. On the other hand, by checking one or more of the options
(Encrypt Contents and Attachments for all Outgoing Messages and Digitally
Sign all Outgoing Messages) on the Security tab of the Options dialog box,
you activate Outlook Express’s built-in security features for all your outgoing
messages. (You can still “turn off” the digital signature or encryption for an
individual message by deselecting the Sign or Encrypt buttons in the toolbar
of the New Message dialog box.)

Chapter 7: Building in Security Upfront

If you use Netscape Messenger, the e-mail application that comes with
Netscape Communicator, follow these steps to encrypt your e-mail
messages or include your certificate with them. (These steps apply to
Netscape 7 or later.)
1. With Messenger running, select Edit➪Mail & Newsgroups Account
Settings.
The Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings window appears.
2. Click the word Security in the list of topics beneath your account
name on the left side of the window.
The Security options appear on the right side of the window.
3. In the Digital Signing section of the window, click Select. 
The Select Certificate dialog box appears.
4. Make sure the VeriSign, Inc. ID is displayed (choose this certificate
from the drop-down list if it is not), and then click OK. 
The Select Certificate dialog box closes. A dialog box appears asking if
you want to use the same certificate for reading and sending messages.
Click OK to return to the Security settings. 
5. Select the Digitally Sign Messages (By Default) check box, and then
click OK. 
The Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings window closes and you return
to the main Messenger window. 
6. You can now address and write your message and then click the Send
button in the Message Composition toolbar.
Your encrypted or digitally signed message is sent on its way.
By checking one or more of the options in the Security dialog box, you activate
Messenger’s built-in security features for all your outgoing messages. In order
to actually verify or undo those features (that is, if you want a message to be
unencrypted or to be sent without a digital signature), you need to follow
these additional steps:
1. With any Messenger window open (Inbox, Message Center, or Message),
click the Compose toolbar button.
The Message Composition window appears.
2. In the Compose window toolbar, click Security.
A drop-down list appears. A check mark appears next to the Encrypt
This Message or Digitally Sign This Message options if you previously
selected either option in the Security dialog box. 
178
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

3. If you want to undo either of these options, click the check box to 
deselect it.
4. You can now address and write your message and then click the Send
button in the Message Composition toolbar.
Your unencrypted or digitally unsigned message is sent on its way.
Picking passwords that are hard to guess
You put a lot of effort into picking the names of your kids and pets, and now
you get to choose passwords. But, whereas you want others to think the names
are cool, the point of creating a password is to make it difficult for thieves to
figure out what it is. That is true whether you’re protecting your own computer,
downloading software, subscribing to an online publication, or applying for a
certificate (as I explain earlier in this chapter).
One method for choosing a password is to take a familiar phrase and then
use the first letter of each word to form the basis of a password. For example,
the phrase “Every Good Boy Does Fine” would be EGBDF. Then, mix upper-
case and lowercase, add punctuation, and you wind up with eGb[d]f. If you
really want to make a password that’s hard to crack, add some numerals as
well, such as the last two digits of the year you were born: eGb[d]f48.
Whatever you do, follow these tips for effective password etiquette:
 Don’t use passwords that are in a dictionary: It takes time but not
much effort for hackers to run a program that tries every word in an
online dictionary as your password. So if it’s in the dictionary, they
will eventually discover it.
 Don’t use the same password at more than one site: It’s a pain to
remember more than one password, not to mention keeping track of
which goes with what. Plus, you tend to accumulate lots of different
passwords after you’ve been online for a while. But if you use the same
password for each purpose and your password to one site on the Internet
is compromised, all your password-protected accounts are in jeopardy.
 Use at least six characters: The more letters in your password, the more
difficult you make the life of the code-crackers.
When it comes to passwords, duplication is not only boring but also danger-
ous. It’s especially important not to reuse the same password that you enter
to connect to your account on a commercial service such as America Online
or CompuServe as a password to an Internet site. If a hacker discovers your
password on the Internet site, that person can use it to connect to your AOL
or CompuServe account, too — and you’ll have to pay for the time they spend
online.

Chapter 7: Building in Security Upfront

A mouthful of protection 
with authentication
Authentication is a fun word to try to say quickly ten times in a row, and it’s
also another common security technique used on the Web. This measure
simply involves assigning approved users an official username and password
that they must enter before gaining access to a protected network, computer,
or directory.
Most Web servers allow you to set up areas of your Web site to be protected
by username and password. Not all Web hosts allow this, however, because
it requires setting up and maintaining a special password file and storing the
file in a special location on the computer that holds the Web server software.
If you need to make some content on your business site (such as sensitive
financial information) available only to registered users, talk to your Web host
to see whether setting up a password-protected area is possible.

Monitoring and Improving 
Your Business
In This Chapter
 Obtaining a better Web address for your online store
 Upgrading your Web server to handle more traffic
 Reorganizing your e-commerce site to improve usability
 Managing your sales stock: Sourcing, replenishing inventory, and fulfilling orders
O
ne of the many advantages of doing business online is the ease with
which you can shift your store’s focus. With a brick-and-mortar estab-
lishment, changing the business’s name, address, or physical appearance can
be labor intensive and expensive. On the Web, you can remake your store’s
front door (your home page) in a matter of minutes. You can revamp your
sales catalog in less than an hour.
Because it’s relatively easy to make changes to your Web site, you have no
excuse for not making regular improvements and updates to your online
store. Revising the store doesn’t just mean changing the colors or the layout
on your Web site, which is the part of your operation that customers notice.
It also means improving back-office functions that customers don’t see, such
as inventory management, invoices, labels, packing, and shipping. This chapter
examines different ways to test, check, and revise your Web site based on its
current performance so that you can boost your revenue and increase sales
as well as make your Web site more usable. 
Strengthening Your Infrastructure
Every business has a foundation — some elements that give it a presence in
the marketplace or in the place where it is physically located. For a traditional,
brick-and-mortar business, this might be an address or phone number, or
the building in which the merchandise is presented and the employees work.
That’s how the post office gets mail to the business, and how the customers
find the business.

For an online business, your infrastructure consists primarily of the domain
name that forms the main part of your Web address, and the Web server that
presents your Web site files — which, in turn, present the merchandise you
have for sale. Your server makes your site available, and your URL gives your
customers a way to find you: Together, they’re the equivalent of your street
address and the physical space you rent. Over time, you may have to change
your domain name if you receive complaints or comments that your site is
too hard to find or your URL is too long. You may also need to find a new Web
server in order to keep your business running more effectively if any of the
following occurs:
 Your pages slow down.
 Customers complain that your forms don’t work.
 You run out of storage space on your server and your host wants to
charge you a high amount for more space.
Other regular upgrades need to be made to your domain and/or your Web
server, as described in the sections that follow.
Improving your domain name
As described in Chapter 3, you have a choice of two different types of domain
names: One that is relatively short (for instance, mynewebusiness.com)
and one that is longer and more difficult to recall off the top of one’s head
(myinternetprovider.com/~mynewebusiness). Even though the first type
of domain name is obviously preferable, many individuals who are creating
their first Web sites start with the longer one. They get a certain amount of
Web server space along with their monthly access account from their Internet
Service Provider. Their natural inclination is to use the directory space they
are given (which has a long URL like the one shown above) just to get the site
started.
Does this sound like your story? There’s nothing wrong with doing things the
easiest way possible when you’re a beginner. But anything you do will evolve
in stages. Before long, you’ll need to find a domain name that more accurately
fits your business or is easier to remember, as described in the sections that
follow. 
Making your own name a domain
Even if you don’t make it active right away, it’s a good idea to lock up a name
to give you the option of using it in the future. For instance, creating a personal
Web site could well still be on your “to do” list. But, if your name is Joe Shmoe,
you may want to purchase the domain name joeshmoe.com just to have it for
future use. If you don’t, one may eventually have to deal with one of the many
domain name cybersquatters. 
182
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Cybersquatters are businesses that make money by buying up multiple
domain names, knowing that people who will eventually want them will have
no choice but to purchase them. If your ideal domain name is owned by a
cybersquatter or by another business, you may have to tweak it a little bit.
When I was looking for domain names, for instance, I was unable to find
Holden.com. An automobile manufacturer in Australia is already using it.
However, I was lucky enough to find gregholden.com, and I snapped it up
right away — even though, at the time, I didn’t have a home page of my own.
You should be doing the same for your own name or your business’s name
right now.
Deciding which top-level domain name to use
Where does a business like yours get the easy-to-remember addresses you
need? You purchase them from one of the approved domain name registrars.
A registrar is a business that has been designated by the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as having the responsibility for
keeping track of the names registered in one of the top-level domains. Originally,
there were six domains; but as .com and others became crowded, alternatives
were eventually approved. The domains available at this writing are shown in
Table 8-1.
A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the primary categories into which addresses
on the Internet are divided. It’s the part of a domain name that comes after the
dot, such as com in .com. A domain name includes the part that comes before
the dot, such as wiley in wiley.com. A fully qualified domain name includes
the host name — for example, www.wiley.com or home.netscape.com.

Some of the newer domain names, of course, haven’t really taken off. They
were created in order to provide alternatives for organizations that couldn’t
find names in the original six domains. The new National Museum of the
American Indian, for instance, has its Web site at nmai.si.edu. It’s part of
the Smithsonian Institution, which uses the .edu domain rather than .org or
.museum. United Airlines is at www.ual.com rather than www.ual.aero. Most
professional contractors try to get a name in the well-known .com domain
rather than .pro or .name.
On the other hand, the .info name apparently has taken off. According to its
registry service, Afilias (www.afilias.info), it is the sixth largest domain
on the Internet, with 460,000 sites. Because virtually every business needs to
put information about itself online, the .info domain is a good alternative if
your first-choice .com domain isn’t available.
The list of domains presented by ICANN (www.icann.org/registrars/
accredited-list.html) indicates that certain domains are “restricted”
only to certain types of individuals or organizations. For instance, .biz is
restricted to businesses, .pro is restricted to licensed professionals, and so
on. In actual practice, businesses don’t observe such restrictions very strictly.
The .net domain, which was originally intended for network service providers
such as ISPs and Web hosts, is commonly used by businesses that can’t find
their ideal name in the .com domain, for example. You aren’t necessarily lim-
ited to one domain, either. 
184
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Registering domain names related to yours
Even if you already have a domain name, it makes sense to pay a nominal
fee to lock up a related name. That way, other businesses cannot attempt
to register a domain that’s like yours and possibly steal some of your visits.
For instance, I own gregholden.com, but I don’t own gregholden.name.
To go about registering such a domain, you would follow these steps: 
1. Start up your Web browser and go to the .name domain’s official reg-
istrar, Global Name Registry (GNR) at www.nic.name.
The home page for GNR Ltd. opens.
2. Click the Registrars link, and then click the link that begins with For a
Full List of All Registrars.
A new browser window opens with a long list of registrars — companies
from which you can purchase .name as well as other domain names.
3. For this example, scroll down to what is probably the best-known reg-
istrar, Network Solutions, and click the Buy Here link in its row of the
table.
The Network Solutions home page appears.
4. Select the .name check box and type your desired name, but without
the www or .name parts (for example, type gregholden if you want
gregholden.name). Then click the Search button.
A Search Results page appears. Hopefully, it will indicate that your desired
name is available. (If it isn’t available, you need to try another name or
click one of the links under the headings View List of Expiring Domain
Names or Try to Get this Domain Name Now.) 
5. Click Continue.
A page full of additional services appears. It’s important to remember
that these are all hosting, e-mail, and other services that Network
Solutions offers in addition to providing you with the ownership of the
domain name.
6. If you don’t need a host or e-mail and you only want to purchase the
domain name, skip these options and click Continue.
The View Your Order page appears.
7. Choose the length of time you want the name (you can register it for
as long as 100 years). Then click Proceed.
The Log In/Create Account page appears. If you have an account, enter it
here. If not, click Create Account and follow the steps shown on subse-
quent screens to pay for your order.
185
Chapter 8: Monitoring and Improving Your Business

Network Solutions may be the best-known registrar, but it’s far from the least
expensive. You’ll save money by shopping around for domain name registrars
at www.icann.org/registrars.
Finding a new Web server
You should always consider the option of finding a new Web host if you aren’t
happy with the one you have. Chances are you’re on a server that shares space
with lots of other individuals and Web sites. If some of the organizations that
share space on your server start streaming audio or video or experience
heavy traffic, the performance of your Web site will likely suffer. You might
well run into Web site outages, too. In either case, you should arrange with
your hosting service to find a better Web server to house your site, or find
another host altogether.
One upgrade you may consider is renting a dedicated computer — a computer
on which yours is the only Web site. This is far more expensive than a shared
hosting account, but after you have developed a customer base and have the
resources, it may well be worth it. Also consider the following factors that
you might find with another host: 
 File transfer capability: The amount of data, in megabytes or kilobytes,
of information that you are allowed to transfer each month before you
are charged an additional fee. Successful e-commerce sites can quickly
pile up thousands of page views per month, and if you go over your
limit, you can get a shock when your bill arrives.
 Marketing services: Some Web hosting services help you advertise your
online business. For instance, Hypermart (www.hypermart.net) enables
customers to list their sites with 1,300 search engines for a one-time
$9.99 fee. It also helps businesses optimize their exposure in search 
listing results (a subject explored in more detail in Chapter 14).
 Technical support: When you are just starting an online business, you’ll
probably have questions you just can’t answer or problems you can’t
solve on your own. It’s to your advantage to choose a host that will pro-
vide you with round-the-clock tech support. The Yahoo! Small Business
hosting options described in Chapter 9 include a toll-free phone number
you can call for support on a 24-hour basis.
Another option you have open to you, if you have a broadband Internet con-
nection, is setting up your own Web server. This means that you have total
control over the management of your Web site. That sounds really nice, but
keep in mind it also means if the pages appear slowly or if your site goes down
for a time, it’s your responsibility to get things up and running again as soon
as possible. If you are ambitious and technically able, you should consider the
popular (not to mention free) Web server program Apache (www.apache.org).
186
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

Setting up and running a Web site is not for beginners. If your kids unplug or
crash the computer on which your Web site is running, your business goes
offline, which can cost you money. If your computer runs slowly or doesn’t
have enough memory, your site’s performance may suffer. It’s generally best
for beginners to leave the hosting to professionals. Web hosts have the ability
to purchase and maintain the best hardware available and have technicians on
call who can solve problems round the clock. If you leave the hosting to some-
one else, you have more time to focus on essentials like building inventory,
maintaining the content on your site, and providing good customer service.
Performing Basic Web Housekeeping
To be better prepared to maintain and improve your Web site, you should
visit it yourself on a regular basis. In fact, you should be the first one to view
your pages when they go online; after that, you need to revisit as often as you
can to make sure that your photos display correctly and that your links take
you where you want them to go. Other helpful tips are described in the fol-
lowing sections.
All Web browsers are not created equally in the way that they handle colors,
fonts, and other Web page elements. Be sure to visit your site by using differ-
ent browsers in order to confirm that things work the way you want in all
cases. At the very least, check your site with Microsoft Internet Explorer and
Netscape Navigator; you may also want to use a new browser called Firefox
(www.mozilla.org).
Making sure your site is organized
One of the fundamental tenets of e-commerce is that products need to be
easy to find. The way you organize your Web site makes sure that your cus-
tomers won’t end up playing hide-and-seek. The people who make a living
writing about and designing Web sites call this usability. As long as the Web
has existed, there have been experts studying what makes a Web site usable.
Most agree on the following essential characteristics:
 Keep it organized. Create a logical path through your site that leads to
your shopping cart and checkout area.
 Keep it simple, sir . . . or madam! Each one of your Web pages should
do one thing and one thing only.
 Keep it searchable. Shoppers who are in a hurry want to jump past all
your meticulously designed sales categories, enter a product name in a
search box, and scan a page full of search results to find what they have
in mind. Give them the chance to do it.
187
Chapter 8: Monitoring and Improving Your Business

You can add a search box to your site and have your pages indexed by a ser-
vice such as FreeFind (www.freefind.com), which is free if you consent to
display ads in your search results, or as little as $5 a month for ad-free results. 
Make sure that your site has a logical page flow. How many Web pages do
your customers have to click through before making their purchases? The
general rule “the fewer the better” applies. Your goal is to lead shoppers into
your site and then encourage them to search through your sales catalog.
188
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 
Make a map of your Web site
Maps are especially important when navigating
the information superhighway. When it comes to
your e-commerce Web site, a site map can help
you make your site easier to navigate. A site map
is a graphical representation of your Web site —
a diagram that graphically depicts all the pages
in the site and how they connect to one another.
Some Web page editing programs, such as
Microsoft FrontPage, have a site map function
built into them. As you create pages and link
them to one another, a site map is created. The
following figure shows the site map on the left
side of the window and a list of files on the right.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to invest in a
fancy (and expensive) software program in
order to create a site map. You can also create
one the old-fashioned way, using a pencil and
paper. Or you can draw boxes and arrows, using
a computer graphics program you’re familiar
with. The point is that your site map can be a
useful design tool for organizing the documents
within your site.
If your sales are sluggish, make sure that your
customers can actually find what they are looking
for. Take a typical product in your sales catalog,
and then visit your own site to see how many
clicks someone would need to make in order to
find it. Then see how many clicks that person
would need to complete its purchase. Eliminating
any unnecessary navigational layers (such as
category opening pages) will make your site
easier to use. 

Adding navigational links
Another reason to review your existing e-commerce Web site is to evaluate
the number of navigational buttons or other links you give your visitors. The
most common options are a row of buttons or links across the top of the
page and a column along the left side of the page. These are the most obvious
places to put such links, but by no means the only types of navigational aids
you can add. Your goal should be to provide three types of links when the
customer is viewing a sales item:
 Links that make it easy to back out of the category the customer is in by
following links to the top level
 A link to your site’s home page
 Links to other parts of your site so that the shopper doesn’t need to
return to the home page continually when the desire to explore a new
sales category arises
The MyTexasMusic.com site shown in Figure 8-1 shows two other types of
useful links that appear on a catalog page. Along the top, the shopper sees a
row of drop-down menu lists; choosing a menu item instantly causes the
browser to jump to another part of the Web site. At the bottom of the item
listing, links appear to related items and to other categories within the site.

Chapter 8: Monitoring and Improving Your Business

Making sure your site is searchable
The single most useful type of navigational aid is a search box — a text box
into which visitors enter keywords to search your catalog by product name
or number. Here again, there are different options for adding such a box to
your site: 
 The hard way: You create a Web page with a text box. You write a script
that will process the data submitted by visitors. The server that hosts
your site will need to be able to process such scripts. Usually, this means
it has to have the programming language present. For instance, if a script
is written in the programming language Perl, the host needs to have Perl
running on the server. Not all hosts allow the execution of scripts on
their servers, however; check with yours to make sure. 
 The less difficult way: You create a Web page with a text box, but you
borrow a script so you don’t have to write your own. You can use the
popular Simple Search form at Matt’s Script Archive (www.script
archive.com). Because this script is written in Perl, your host must
have Perl running on the server. 
 The Microsoft way: Most Web hosts allow the use of a set of programs
called the FrontPage Server Extensions. If you have FrontPage, you can
use it to create your own searchable site index. 
 The easy way: You sign up with a service that indexes your site — in
other words, scours your Web pages and records their contents — and
provides you with a search box that you can add to your site. 
Because the latter option is the one that doesn’t require any programming
and is easiest for beginners, I describe it in more detail. Services that make
other peoples’ Web sites searchable usually provide two options. One is free,
but the results that appear when someone searches your site have advertise-
ments displayed as well. The other isn’t free, but the search results are ad-free.
These days, shoppers are so accustomed to seeing ads displayed all over the
Web that they probably won’t be put off if some appear in your search results.
So I wouldn’t be reluctant to choose the free search option if it is available. 
Picosearch (www.picosearch.com) makes it easy to place a search box on a
Web site, either on a free, ad-supported basis or on a monthly subscription
basis. Go to the site’s home page at www.picosearch.com and follow these
steps to use the free service: 
1. Type your site’s URL and your e-mail address in the boxes supplied,
and click Submit.
The Site Search New Account Setup page appears.
190
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

2. Type your name and a password in the boxes supplied. Type the URLs
for the pages you want to serve as entry points to your site. Also adjust
the options for indexing and spidering (the amount of searching that
can be done).
If you’re in doubt about which options to choose, just leave the defaults
for now; you can change them later.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the New Account Setup page, select the check
box that says you agree to the terms of the Picosearch license, and
click OK, Build My FREE Search Engine!
A page appears informing you that your Web site is being indexed.
You’ll also receive at least two e-mails from Picosearch. You need to click
a link in the first e-mail in order to complete the registration for your free
account. (The second tells you that your site is being indexed.) A third
e-mail (which can take up to 24 hours to arrive) tells you the indexing

A search of your Web site is only as effective as the most recent index of your
pages and their contents. If you revamp or improve your Web site (as you
should periodically), you need to have your site reindexed by your search ser-
vice. Picosearch gives its customers the ability to reindex their site manually
at any time — in other words, you go to the Picosearch Web site and request
that your site be reindexed. But if you pay a monthly fee for Picosearch instead
of using the free version, you can schedule automatic reindexing so that you
don’t have to worry about requesting a new survey of your site on your own.
Whenever you sign up for “free” services and submit an e-mail address, you are
liable to receive unsolicited commercial e-mail (that is, spam) at that address.
One solution is to not use your primary e-mail address for such registrations.
Instead, set up an address specifically for this purpose and then cancel it when
it becomes overrun by too much spam.
Taking your site for a test run
After you’ve enhanced your Web site with navigational aids, search boxes, and
other changes, you need to visit it yourself to make sure everything works
the way you want. You not only need to make sure that your site creates a
good visual impression, but to also watch out for any problems you have to
undo, such as:
 Background colors that are too similar to the color of your body text
and that make your text hard to read
 Images that aren’t cropped closely enough, which makes them bigger
in file size than they need to be (which, in turn, makes them appear on
screen too slowly)
 Pages that are overcrowded, with insufficient room between columns or
between images and text
 Errors in spelling or grammar
 Type that’s too small and can’t be read easily by older viewers
 Copyright notices or “This site was last updated on . . .” messages that
are old and out of date
 Factual statements that are no longer accurate
It makes sense to perform such evaluations when you change your site.
But you should test things out whenever you move files from your computer
to your Web server. In order to know how to best make improvements, it is
important to continue to test and make evaluations.

your own site, visit Web Pages That Suck (www.webpagesthatsuck.com).
Author Vincent Flanders includes a feature called Mystery Meat Navigation
that shows how not to guide visitors through your Web site. 
Managing Goods and Services
Shoppers on the Web are continually in search of The New: the next new prod-
uct, the latest price reduction or rebate, the latest comment in a blog, today’s
headlines. As a provider of content, whether it is in the form of words or images
or products for sale, your job is to manage that content to keep it fresh and
available. You also need to replenish stock as it is purchased, handle returns,
and deal with shipping options, as described in the sections that follow.
Sourcing goods
Sourcing is a fancy term for “buying items at a really low price so that you can
resell them for a profit.” For a small business just starting out on the Internet,
this is not an easy prospect. Lots of online businesses advertise themselves
as wholesale sellers. Many say they will “drop-ship” their merchandise — in
other words, ship what’s purchased directly from their wholesale facility so
you never actually have to handle them and may never see them. 
Sound too good to be true? In many cases, it is, and you should always exer-
cise a healthy dose of caution when you’re looking for wholesale suppliers.
The eBay sellers I’ve talked to who have faithful, reliable wholesalers guard
the identities of those suppliers jealously. They usually find such suppliers
only by word of mouth: Rather than answering an ad or visiting a Web site,
they ask someone who knows someone who . . . you get the idea.
If you aren’t in the business of selling goods or services that you manufacture
yourself, you need to find a steady stream of merchandise that you can sell
online. Your goal is to find a wholesaler who can supply you with good-quality
items at rock-bottom prices; you can mark up the prices and make a profit while
keeping the prices low enough to make them attractive. Generally, the best
wholesale items are small objects that can be packed and shipped inexpen-
sively. On eBay, things like figurines, ornaments, stationery, and other small gift
items are commonly sold by PowerSellers along with the occasional antiques
and collectibles. Here are a few rules of thumb for finding items you can resell: 
 Try them out yourself. Purchase a few items yourself to start with, or
ask the wholesaler for samples. (Resist any attempts by the wholesaler
to sell you, say 10,000 items at a supposedly dirt-cheap price right off
the bat.) Take a few of the items for a test drive. It’s easier to convince
others to buy what you like yourself.
194
Part II: Establishing Your Online Presence 

 Try to sell many small, low-priced items rather than a few large ones.
Instead of computers or printers, consider selling computer memory
chips or printer ink cartridges, for instance.
 Ask for references. Talk to businesspeople who have already worked
with the supplier. Ask how reliable the supplier is, and whether the
prices are prone to fluctuate.
When looking for merchandise to sell, try to build on your own hobbies and
interests. If you collect model cars, try to develop a sideline selling parts,
paints, and components online. You’ll find the process more enjoyable when
you are dealing in things you love and know well. 
Handling returns
Your returns policy depends on the venue where you make your sales. If you
sell primarily on eBay, you should accept returns, if only because many of the
most experienced and successful sellers do, too. That doesn’t mean you need
to accept every single item that is returned. Most businesses place restric-
tions on when they will receive a return and send a refund. The items must
be returned within 30 days; the packages must be unopened; the merchandise
must not be damaged.
Adding shipping rates
As part of creating a usable e-commerce catalog, you need to provide cus-
tomers with shipping costs for your merchandise. Shipping rates can be 
difficult to calculate. They depend on your own geographic location as
well as the location where you are planning to ship. If you are a small-scale
operation and you process each transaction manually, you may want to ship
everything a standard way (UPS Ground, FedEx Home Delivery, or USPS
Parcel Post). Then you can keep a copy of your shipper’s charges with you
and calculate each package’s shipping cost individually.
You can also save time by using the quick shipping calculator provided by
iShip (www.iship.com). Just go to the site’s home page, enter the origin and
destination zip codes, and click Go. You’ll get a set of shipping rates from
Airborne Express, UPS, and USPS so you can pick the most cost-effective option.
If you want some help with shipping, you can set up your site with the help of
a transaction hosting service such as ChannelAdvisor (www.channeladvisor.
com). This company has an agreement with the USPS so that it automatically
calculates shipping charges and includes those charges in the invoices it sends
to your customers.

Chapter 8: Monitoring and Improving Your Business

Maintaining inventory
Shoppers on the Web want things to happen instantly. They want to get the
most out of their fancy broadband connections. If they discover that you’re
out of stock of an item they want, they’re likely to switch to another online
business instead of waiting for you to restock that item. With that in mind,
obey the basic principle of planning to be successful: Instead of ordering the
bare minimum of this or that item, make sure you have enough to spare. Too
much inventory initially is better than running out at some point, in other
words.
Rely on software or management services to help you keep track of what you
have. If you feel at ease working with databases, record your initial inventory
in an Access or SQL database. This forces you to record each sale manually
in the database so you know how many items are left. You could connect
your sales catalog to your database by using a program such as ColdFusion
from Macromedia. Such a program can update the database on the fly as
sales are made. But you may need to hire someone with Web programming
experience to set the system up for you and make sure it actually works.
If you sign up with an online store solution like Yahoo! Small Business or a
sales management provider like Marketworks (www.marketworks.com),
inventory is tracked for you automatically. Marketworks is popular with
eBay auction sellers, but there’s no reason why you can’t establish an
account with back-end functions such as payment, invoices, and inventory
management for any online store. Whether you do the work yourself or hire
an outside service, you have to be able to answer basic questions such as: 
 When should you reorder? Establish reorder points: Points at which you
automatically reorder supplies (when you get down to two or three items
left, for instance).
 How many do you have in stock right now? You need to make sure that
you have enough merchandise on hand not only for everyday demand
but also in case a product gets hot or the holiday season brings about a
dramatic increase in orders.
An e-commerce hosting service may also be able to help you with questions
that go beyond the basics, such as the past purchasing history of customers.
Knowing what customers have purchased in the past gives you the ability to
suggest up-sells — additional items the person might want. But in the early
stages, making sure that you have a cushion of additional inventory for the
time when your site becomes a big success is your primary responsibility.

In this part . . .
G
oing into business doesn’t mean going it alone.
When you’re just starting out, it makes sense to
sign up with a service that makes it easy for you to create
a storefront, list products online, and accept electronic
payments. 
For one thing, you don’t necessarily want to quit your day
job right away. You aren’t ready to start making money
online 24/7 and maintain the infrastructure that goes with
an online business. Signing up with a well-known hosting
service is like renting office space in a mall, except that
in this case, your virtual landlord gives you a jump-start.
In this part, you discover how to start making money with
the help of online business stalwarts such as Amazon.com,
Yahoo!, PayPal, and eBay.

and Other Storefronts

 Merchandising your creative work with CafePress
 Opening a storefront with PayPal or Microsoft
O
nline storefronts have always been among the most popular places to sell
online. But you don’t have to do all the work of creating a home page,
setting up a shopping cart, and establishing a way to collect payments all by
yourself. By locating your storefront on a well-established and well-known 
e-commerce venue, you can rack up sales without spending the big bucks on
marketing and infrastructure. You can take advantage of the marketing tools
the site gives you. 
Other chapters in this book describe how to create a commercial Web site
and an eBay store. Even if you have one of those sales venues, that doesn’t
mean you can’t open up stores in other popular locations on the Web. In fact,
the more places you “pop up” as a Web merchant, the better. Your stores can
sell different products and link to one another, which boosts your business
overall. This chapter examines some of the best-known alternatives for making
money with well-known hosting services on the Web.
Becoming an Amazon.com Seller
Over the years, Amazon.com has become known as “Earth’s biggest book-
seller.” It’s done so by selling books on the site all by itself. Having conquered
the world of online bookselling, Amazon.com is attempting to give individual
entrepreneurs different options for generating revenue. You will find links
leading to many of the options for selling with Amazon.com if you go to the
home page (www.amazon.com) and click the See All Services link under the
heading Make Money. 

Amazon.com gives entrepreneurs a variety of ways to sell on its site. If you
have a book or CD to sell, you are allowed to list it on Amazon.com — and
not only that, but you get to place your ad alongside the listing for the same
book that’s being sold brand new on the site. 
Become an Amazon.com Associate
You’re probably already familiar with the idea of an affiliate program. The
Amazon.com Associates program works like you would expect: When you
become an Amazon.com Associate (in Chapter 15 is an example of a site that
uses the program), you place a link to Amazon.com on your Web site. When
someone makes a purchase after following the link from your site, you earn a
referral fee.
If you have written or created books, CDs, or other materials that are sold on
Amazon.com, you can create links to those items on your own Web site and
refer your visitors to the bookseller’s site so that you can potentially earn the
referral fee. It so happens that I have a few books that are sold on Amazon.com,
and I include images of several of these books on my own Web site (www.
gregholden.com). I already had several of the ingredients for generating
referral income: a Web site, books to sell, and a need for extra revenue. All
that remained was to sign up with the Amazon.com Associates program and
create specially formatted links that I associate with each of the book images
on my home page. 
Even if you haven’t written books or created CDs, you can create links to books
you like or recommend and use those as referrals to the Amazon.com Web site. 
To get started with the program, just follow these steps:
1. Go to the Amazon.com home page and click the Join Associates link
(at the bottom of the page).
2. Click the Join Now button (on the left side). 
3. Fill out the forms provided to become a member.
You have to tell Amazon.com whether you want to receive a check or a
direct deposit into your bank account. I chose the direct deposit method,
so I entered my bank account number and bank routing number. When
you become a member of the program, you gain access to the Amazon.com
Associates Central area. 
4. Log in as directed and access your own welcome page on the site. 
You have to set up the Associates links according to Amazon.com’s spec-
ifications so it can track when the links are clicked and determine
whether purchases are subsequently made. 
5. From the Associates Central welcome page, click the Build Links link. 
200
Part III: Successful Online Business Models 

A table appears describing four types of links you can make: 
• Product Links: These are links to specific books, movies, or CDs
you want to promote. 
• Recommended Product Links: These are banner ads you display
on your site that display books or other products on Amazon.com
that are related to the products you sell. For instance, if you sell baby
clothes, you might recommend a book on parenting that you like. 
• Search Box Links: You put an Amazon.com search box on your site.
The box lets your visitors search Amazon.com, not your own site.
If someone makes a purchase after making such a search, you get a
referral fee. 
• Text Links: If the search box takes up too much graphic space on
your Web pages, include a simple text link that points people to
books or CDs on Amazon.com. 
You can promote your friends’ books and CDs, books or CDs that relate
to your own goods and services, or other books and CDs you admire. By
spreading the word about such materials, you can earn a few cents or
perhaps a few dollars. Because I have some specific books to promote, I
chose the first option, Product Links. 
6. Choose a link option, and then click Create Link.
7. On the next page that appears, search for the book or CD that you
want to promote. 
The results of my search are shown in Figure 9-1.

8. Click the Get HTML button to access some HTML code that you then
copy and add to your Web page in order to display the product cover. 
This display serves as a link to the book or CD’s page on Amazon.com. 
I noticed that, by default, the image opened as an inline frame — a con-
tainer within the Web page. This seemed too complex to me, so I clicked
Customize HTML and changed the link to a simple clickable image file
rather than a frame. I highlighted the HTML and pasted it into my Web
page, which produced the link shown in Figure 9-2. 
You probably won’t make a fortune from Amazon.com’s referral fees. You earn
four to five percent of the value of the items sold, depending on the number of
items you sell. If you refer someone who purchases a book for $15, for instance,
you earn about 75 cents for that purchase. 
Join the marketplace
Suppose you’ve got a pile of recently published books or CDs around (books or
CDs that are being sold on Amazon.com) and you need to sell them. When you
join the Amazon Marketplace, you gain the ability to sell those books yourself.
Suppose you purchased a book called eBay PowerUser’s Bible, and you were so
happy with it that you just felt compelled to sell it so others could share the
wisdom contained within. (You can guess who wrote this book, can’t you?)
Here’s an example of how you would sell it:

Pro Merchant subscription
If you have lots of items to sell, consider becoming a Pro Merchant Subscriber.
You have to pay a $39.99 monthly fee to be part of this Amazon.com program,
but there are some big advantages: 
 You don’t have to pay the 99 cent fee.
 Your listings are not closed after 60 days.
 You can open a storefront called a zShop, as described in the next 
section. 
It also allows you to use the powerful inventory reports to view orders,
sold listings, and current open listings. You also get access to a bulk listing
tool so that you can create lots of descriptions at once. You’ve got to sell
at least a few books each month to make back your subscription fee, but if
you’re a bookseller by trade and have a lot of inventory to unload, this is a
good alternative. 
You can find out more about the Pro Merchant program at s1.amazon.com/
exec/varzea/subscription-signup/103-9425472-8733429. 
Opening a zShop
zShops are Amazon.com’s online shops. This is where professional and ama-
teur sellers alike can sell items that go well beyond the things normally found
on the site — everything from autographed items, vintage goods, food, wine,
computer equipment, and much more. 
Click the Buy It! button on the detail page of the item that interests you, and
then complete your transaction with the individual seller. After you’ve sub-
mitted your order for an item on zShops, you’ll receive an e-mail telling you
how to proceed with your transaction. You’ll also receive the seller’s e-mail
address, in case you want to contact him or her about payment and the ship-
ping of your purchase.
zShops sellers do receive feedback from people with whom they’ve done
business, and you can check that feedback. But the feedback system isn’t
nearly as well developed as the eBay feedback system because zShops just
aren’t that well known. However, if the seller fails to deliver after you pay for
something, or if the item you receive differs substantially from what you
ordered, you do have some protection in the form of Amazon.com’s A-to-z
Guarantee. Amazon.com will refund your loss in such cases. Find out more
about the guarantee at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/

Amazon.com auctions
eBay may be the big gorilla when it comes to auctions on the Internet, but if
you already sell on Amazon.com, you should consider selling on its auction
site. Before you sell, be sure to have some digital photos in JPEG or GIF format
ready. Here’s how to get started: 
1. Go to the site’s home page (www.amazon.com) and click the Auctions
link under the heading Bargains on the left side of the page.
The Amazon.com – Auctions page appears.
2. Click Sign In. 
The Sign In page appears. 
If you don’t have an Amazon.com account, create one by entering your
e-mail address and clicking the button next to I Do Not Have an
Amazon.com Password, and then clicking Continue.
If you have an Amazon.com username and password and the site “recog-
nizes” you by name — either because you have already logged in or
because a bit of electronic data called a cookie was retrieved by the site
from your browser’s storage area — move to Step 4. If not, move to Step 3.
3. Sign in with your Amazon.com username and password and click
Continue.
The Amazon.com – Registration page appears.
4. Click the Sell Items link (at the bottom of the page).
5. On the Make Money page that appears, click the Marketplace link
(under the I Have Something to Sell heading).
The Sell Your Stuff form appears.
6. Fill out the form to create your auction sale.
It’s as simple as that. Amazon.com’s auction form asks for virtually the same
information as eBay’s Sell Your Item form, which allows members to create
auction or fixed-price sales on its site. You create an auction title, a descrip-
tion, and upload photos of your item. One bit of information that Amazon.com’s
form lets you enter that eBay doesn’t have is a product identification number
such as the ISBN number used to identify books. You also have the option to
list your auction as long as 14 days, which is longer than eBay’s 10-day limit. 
The tip jar
This system, also called the Honor System, gives you a way to solicit donations
for your Web site or for your content. Even if someone doesn’t make a purchase
from you, or if you provide content that doesn’t include tangible goods for sale
(such as a blog), the tip jar gives you a way to make some money for your efforts. 
205
Chapter 9: Setting Up Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and Other Storefronts

To set up a tip jar on your own Web site, go to the Amazon Honor System
home page (s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/subst/fx/home.html) and
click Join Now to register for the program. You verify your identity, and then
enter your checking account information so that money can be deposited
into your account when you receive a “tip.” After that, you place HTML pro-
vided by Amazon.com into the source code for the Web page where you want
the Tip Jar icon to appear. Visitors can click on a button embedded in the
icon, and Amazon.com provides a form where customers enter the amount
they want to pay and the account from which they want the funds to be deb-
ited. (The tippers must have a PayPal account to leave tips.) Many bloggers
have gained valuable extra funds from such a tip jar, which demonstrates the
value of providing useful content online.
Creating a Yahoo! Small Business
In previous editions of this book, I described the process of creating an
online store by using one of the most popular and successful e-commerce
hosting services around, the one managed by the longtime index and search
service Yahoo!. Until recently, the service was known as Yahoo! Store. It’s now
called Yahoo! Small Business (smallbusiness.yahoo.com). Over the years,
Yahoo! Store hosted many successful and well-known businesses; the site
provides you with Web-based forms and tools that you access online with
your browser (a page-in-progress is shown in Figure 9-3). These tools make
it easy for you to create a storefront and list items for sale. 
There’s one significant difference between Yahoo! Store and Yahoo! Small
Business. Yahoo! Store let you set up a store for free on a 30-day trial basis.
With Yahoo! Small Business, you have to sign up for a hosting account and
commit to pay a monthly fee before you can establish a storefront. Three
hosting plans are available: Starter ($11.95 per month), Standard ($19.95 per
month), and Professional ($39.95 per month). There’s also a $25 setup fee,
but at the time this was written, the fee was being waived as a promotion. 
One of the biggest advantages for Yahoo! Small Business subscribers is toll-
free, 24/7 phone support. Another is the fact that storefronts hosted with this
service can make use of a built-in shopping cart and payment system. The
fact that Yahoo! is so well known and has been around so long means that it
is reliable: The service is not likely to go down due to technical troubles but
will be there for years to come. 
Yahoo! offers another Web hosting service that streamlines the process of
creating personal home pages and business Web sites. It’s called Yahoo!
GeoCities (geocities.yahoo.com). The site chares a $10 setup fee plus
either $4.95 or $8.95 per month for hosting.

Chapter 9: Setting Up Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and Other Storefronts
The gift that keeps on giving — with Yahoo!’s help
Have you ever wondered what you could give a
niece or nephew as a gift that would make a dif-
ference in his or her life? Jeremy G. Alicandri
received a gift when he was 16 years old that had
more of an impact than the giver could have pos-
sibly imagined. And it all came about because
he quickly became bored with his gift. What he
had unwrapped was a set of professional two-
way radios. When they lost their appeal, Jeremy
put them up for sale on eBay. He was pleased
to be able to sell each radio for $100, which was
far more than they had originally cost. 
“Before I knew it, I was selling radios for profit,”
he says. “Within six months of selling on eBay,
I’d made $800, which was enough to launch
SimplyCheap.com (www.simplycheap.com)
in 1999. At that point, I ran the company as a
business and began offering all types of new
consumer electronics and related items.” 
Now at the ripe old age of 22, Jeremy is running
his online business full time with a Yahoo! Small
Business account. He briefly considered run-
ning his own server, but he figures that the cost
of doing it himself would far exceed the bene-
fits. “For example, if a server goes down, I know
I have the resources of Yahoo! to fix it. That
gives me tremendous peace of mind,” he says.
He went on to list six reasons why he chose this
particular e-commerce host:
 It is the most established e-commerce host
around.
 It has the largest e-commerce platform,
meaning that many companies supported
its products.
 It includes integration into Yahoo! Shopping
so that your store is listed in its shopping
directory.
 The store builder is easy to use.
 There is a back-end processing order 
manager.
 You get access to 24/7 phone support.
As you can tell, Alicandri believes that being
part of a big, well-known Web site with lots of
other businesses helps him find customers.
However, he also points out that it presents the
potential customer with more competitors prior
to entering his site.
When asked to identify the one or two most
important features that an online storefront must
have in order to succeed, Alicandri responded
with the following:
 Provide understandable content: Products,
descriptions, prices, policies, navigation, and
so on.
 Fulfillment:Any store must be able to manage
every aspect of an order, from beginning to
end, in a thorough manner.
Alicandri points out that the Internet has matured
significantly over the past five years, and he
admits that it’s now much more difficult to launch
a successful store and achieve profitable sales.
Here are his two major bits of advice:
 Know your product: Is it already being sold
on the Net? Who is selling it? Where is it
being sold? Can you be competitive? Who
are your potential customers?
 Be reasonable: Don’t overextend on adver-
tising costs. Be realistic about the costs of
the store. Monitor conversions. Make plans
that can be reached in stages.
What’s left for the boy wonder entrepreneur?
Now he’s launching a novel business called
Inforigin. Inforigin will address the needs of
businesses that currently manage or are con-
sidering launching a Web business. “We plan on
managing all types of sites, ranging from e-tail
sites to manufacturer’s sites, at an incredible
value to the client,” says Alicandri.

Creating Other Storefronts
Amazon.com and Yahoo! are among the best-known Web businesses. While
their hosting services are reliable, they might not be ideal for your needs. If
you’re a creative artist and you just want to sell a few examples of your work
to family and friends, CafePress might be just what you need. If you already
have an account with PayPal and regularly use its payment services for sales
on eBay, it makes sense to open a PayPal store. If you use Microsoft products
such as FrontPage to create your Web pages, Microsoft Small Business Center
is a good option for creating an online sales catalog and storefront. It’s all a
matter of deciding what you need. These alternatives are described in the
sections that follow. 
Letting CafePress sell your creative work
Creative people aren’t always the best at marketing and selling their own work.
There are probably millions of amateur artists out there hoping to become
professionals: They have great ideas for cartoons, logos, and drawings, but
the prospect of getting them printed and sold in stores is a big obstacle. 
I’ve known one such person since she was a little girl: Her name is Kristin
Lindner, and she lives in St. Louis, Missouri. She created a Web site called
Elephant of Joy (www.elephantofjoy.com) to promote her line of greeting
cards. When she expressed a desire to have the cards actually printed and
sold at holiday time, her mother and I were faced with the prospect of sending
them to a printer, with all that the process entails: minimum orders; choices

of paper; proofs to review; and folding and delivery questions, not to mention
the money involved. 
As a cost-effective alternative, I encouraged Kristin to set up a store on
CafePress.com. This service is ideally suited to artists who want to have their
work printed on T-shirts, cards, and other household objects that they can
sell online. The objects are only printed on demand when the order is made,
so there’s no question of having inventory sitting around waiting to be sold. I
had Kristin send me a set of her drawings that had been scanned and saved
in JPEG format. I then followed the steps detailed in Chapter 3 to create her
own store on CafePress (which was assigned the URL www.cafepress.com/
elephantofjoy), along with a line of greeting cards. In a few hours, I was
able to upload a number of images that she had created and assemble the
product line shown in Figure 9-4.

Chapter 9: Setting Up Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and Other Storefronts

CafePress.com sets a base price for each object. For instance, a set of six
greeting cards has a base price of $10.99. If you charge $14.99 for the cards,
CafePress.com collects the base price, but you get the $4.99 profit. But you
don’t have to do the printing or shipping; CafePress.com handles all of that
for you. 
Launching a PayPal shop
PayPal, the online payment service, was popular long before it became part
of the eBay empire. It also gives you the ability to start up a PayPal store.
Because eBay and PayPal are now affiliated, this gives you the chance to
create links between your eBay Store and your PayPal store. One nice feature
about PayPal is that you get a Shop search box on the left side of your store. 
PayPal sellers, like eBay sellers, have a numeric rating that indicates how
trustworthy their performance has been. It’s called the PayPal reputation
number, and it appears next to your name on PayPal. It indicates how many
Verified PayPal members have paid you. 
Opening a Microsoft Small Business
Many of the successful businesspeople I’ve interviewed prefer to host their 
e-commerce Web sites with well-known companies because such companies are
reliable. They have lots of technical resources, and they are likely to be around
for the long haul. Microsoft certainly fits that description. Its own e-commerce
hosting service, Microsoft Small Business Center (formerly known as bCentral),
provides the same sorts of services as the other hosts described in this chapter.
It enables you to set up an online store; it streamlines the process of setting up
a sales catalog; it provides you with a payment system; it gives its members
various technical support options. 
Microsoft Small Business Center is more expensive than Yahoo! Small
Business; the least expensive hosting option runs $12.95 per month. But it
does give you a 30-day free trial period, which Yahoo! Small Business does
not offer. The biggest advantage is support for Microsoft FrontPage. If you
use FrontPage to create and update your Web site, you can sign up for an
account with Microsoft Small Business Center and install a special piece of
software called the Commerce Manager Add-In. This add-in enables you to
set up a sales catalog and manage an e-commerce site from within Microsoft
FrontPage. If you don’t use FrontPage and you sign up for hosting with
Microsoft Small Business Center, you can still use Commerce Manager, but
you have to pay an additional $24.95 per month fee.

Chapter 10
Running a Business on eBay
In This Chapter
 Developing a solid reputation to attract more business
 Writing sales descriptions that attract bidders
 Giving your customers excellent service
 Starting a part-time or full-time eBay business
H
ere’s a quick quiz: Throughout the ups and downs of e-commerce in the
1990s and early 2000s, what marketplace has remained strong and con-
tinued to grow at a steady rate? As you probably know already, it’s eBay — I
say you probably know this because chances are you’ve already bought or
sold some things yourself on the world’s most popular auction site (or maybe
this chapter’s title gave you a hint). 
There’s a difference, though, between selling occasionally in order to make
a few extra bucks and doing what thousands have already done: selling on
eBay as a means of self-employment. eBay itself has estimated that as many
as 450,000 individuals run a business on the auction site full time. Countless
others do it on a permanent part-time basis to help boost the family income.
Whatever the reason, you can’t overlook eBay as a way to get a first business
off the ground. With eBay, you don’t necessarily have to create a Web site,
develop your own shopping cart, or become a credit card merchant: The auc-
tion site itself handles each of those essential tasks for you. But that doesn’t
mean it’s easy to develop your own eBay business. It takes hard work and a
commitment, combined with the important business strategies described in
this chapter. 
Running a business on eBay doesn’t necessarily mean you depend on eBay as
the sole source of your income. It might mean you sell on eBay part time for
some supplementary income each month. This chapter assumes that you want
to sell regularly on eBay and build up a system for successful sales that can
provide you with extra money, bill-paying money, or “fun money.”

Understanding eBay Auctions
In any contest, you have to know the ground rules. Anyone who has held a
garage sale knows the ground rules for making a person-to-person sale. But
eBay is different, and not just because auctions are the primary format. eBay
gives its members many different ways to sell, and each sales format has its
own set of rules and procedures. It pays to know something about the differ-
ent sales so that you can choose the right format for the item you have. 
This section assumes that you have some basic knowledge of eBay and that
you have at least shopped for a few items and possibly won some auctions.
When it comes to putting items up for sale, eBay gets more complicated.
You’ve got the following sales options: 
 Standard auctions: This is the most basic eBay auction: You put an
item up for sale, and you specify a starting bid (usually, a low amount
from $1 to $9.99). You don’t have a reserve price; the highest bidder at
the end of the sale wins (if there is a highest bidder). Standard auctions
and other auctions on eBay can last one, three, five, seven, or ten days.
The ending time is precise: If you list something at 10:09 a.m. on a Sunday
and you choose a seven-day format, the sale then ends at 10:09 a.m. the
following Sunday. 
 Reserve auctions: A reserve price is a price you specify as a minimum in
order for a purchase to be successful. Any bids placed on the item being
offered must be met or exceeded; otherwise, the sale will end without
the seller being obligated to sell the item. You know if a reserve price
is present by the message Reserve Not Yet Met next to the current
high bid. When a bid is received that exceeds the reserve, this message
changes to Reserve Met. The reserve price is concealed until the reserve
is met. 
 Multiple-item auctions: This type of sale, also known as a Dutch auction,
is used by sellers who want to sell more than one identical item at the
same time. The seller specifies a starting bid and the number of items
available; bidders can bid on one or more items. But the question of who
wins can be confusing. The bidders who win are the ones who have placed
the lowest successful bid that is still above the minimum price, based on
the number of items being offered. For instance, suppose six items are
offered, and ten bidders place bids. One bidder bids $20 for two items.
Another bids $24 for one. Three others bid $18, two others bid $14, and
three bid $10. The winners are the ones who bid $24, $20, and $18,
respectively. The others lose out because only six items are available. 
 Fixed-price Buy It Now (BIN) sales: A BIN price is a fixed price that
the seller specifies. Fixed prices are used in all eBay Stores: The seller
specifies that you can purchase the item for, say, $10.99; you click the
Buy It Now button, agree to pay $10.99 plus shipping, and you instantly
win the item. 
212
Part III: Successful Online Business Models 

 Mixed auction/fixed price sales: BIN prices can be offered in conjunction
with standard or reserve auctions. In other words, even though bidders
are placing bids on the item, if someone agrees to pay the fixed price,
the item is immediately sold and the sale ends. If a BIN price is offered in
conjunction with a standard auction, the BIN price is available until the
first bid is placed; then the BIN price disappears. If a BIN price is offered
in conjunction with a reserve auction, the BIN price is available until the
reserve price is met. After the BIN price disappears, the item is available
to the highest bidder. 
Those are the basic types of sales. You can also sell automobiles on eBay
Motors or even sell on eBay Live Auctions (www.ebayliveauctions.com).
By knowing how eBay sales work and following the rules competently, you’ll
gradually develop a good reputation on the auction site. 
How you sell is important, but the question of exactly what you should sell
is one you should resolve well before you start your eBay business. Sell
something you love, something you don’t mind spending hours shopping for,
photographing, describing, and eventually packing up and shipping. Sell some-
thing that has a niche market of enthusiastic collectors or other customers.
Do some research on eBay to make sure there aren’t already a thousand people
peddling the same things you hope to make available. 
Building a Good Reputation
In order to run a business on eBay, you need to have a steady flow of repeat
customers. Customer loyalty comes primarily from the trust that is produced
by developing a good reputation. eBay’s feedback system is the best indicator
of how trustworthy and responsive a seller is because past performance is a
good indication of the kind of service a customer can expect in the future.
Along with deciding what you want to sell and whether you want to sell on
eBay on a part- or full-time basis, you need to have the development of a
good reputation as one of your primary goals as well. 
Feedback, feedback, feedback!
eBay’s success is due in large measure to the network of trust it has established
among its millions of members. The feedback system, in which members leave
positive, negative, or neutral comments for the people with whom they have
conducted (or tried to conduct) transactions is the foundation for that trust.
The system rewards users who accumulate significant numbers of positive
feedback comments and penalizes those who have low or negative feedback
numbers. By taking advantage of the feedback system, you can realize the
highest possible profit on your online sales and help get your online business
off the ground. 
213
Chapter 10: Running a Business on eBay

There probably aren’t any scientific studies of how feedback numbers affect
sales, but I’ve heard anecdotally from sellers that their sales figures increase
when their feedback levels hit a certain number. The number varies, but it
appears to be in the hundreds — perhaps 300 or so. The inference is that
prospective buyers place more trust in sellers who have higher feedback
numbers because they have more experience and are presumably more 
trustworthy. Those who have a PowerSeller icon are even more trustworthy
(see the “Striving for PowerSeller status” section later in this chapter). 
Developing a schedule
One thing that can boost your reputation above all else on eBay is timeliness.
If you respond to e-mail inquiries within a few hours, or at most a day or two,
and if you can ship out merchandise quickly, you’re virtually guaranteed to
have satisfied customers who leave you positive feedback. The way to achieve
timely response is to observe a work schedule. 
It’s tedious and time consuming to take and retake photos, edit those photos,
get sales descriptions online, and do the packing and shipping that’s required
at the end of a sale. The only way to come up with a sufficient number of sales
every week is to come up with a system. And a big part of coming up with a
system is developing a weekly schedule that spells out when you need to do
all of your eBay activities. A possible schedule might look like Table 10-1.
Table 10-1

You’ll notice that there’s something conspicuously missing from this pro-
posed schedule: a day of rest. You can certainly work in such a day on
Sunday (or whatever day you prefer). If you sell on eBay part time, you
can probably take much of the weekend off. But most full-time sellers
214
Part III: Successful Online Business Models 

(and full-time self-employed people in general) will tell you that it’s difficult
to find a day off, especially when it’s so important to respond to customer
e-mails within a day or two of their receipt. You don’t have to do everything
all by yourself, however. You can hire full- or part-time help, which can free
up time for family responsibilities. 
Creating an About Me page
One of the best ways to build your reputation on eBay is to create a Web
page that eBay makes available to each of its members free of charge called
About Me. Your About Me page should talk about who you are, why you col-
lect or sell what you do, and why you’re a reputable seller. You can also talk
about an eBay Store, if you have one, and provide links to your current auc-
tion sales. It takes only a few minutes to create an About Me page (not much
longer than filling out the Sell Your Item form to get a sale online, in fact).
If you want to include a photo, you should take a digital image and edit it in
an image-editing program such as Paint Shop Pro or Photoshop, just as you
would any other image. But a photo isn’t absolutely necessary. Kimberly
King, the eBay seller profiled later in this chapter, has a simple About Me
page (see Figure 10-1). 
Figure 10-1:

Me page
can be sim-
ple; it can

215
Chapter 10: Running a Business on eBay

When you’ve decided what you want to say on your page, you need to save a
digital photo if you want to include one. You then need to upload your photo
to the Web server where you usually store your photos. Make note of the URL
that identifies the location of the photo (for example, www.myphotohost.com/
mydirectory/photoname.jpg). Then follow these steps: 
1. Click My eBay on the navigation bar near the top right corner of virtu-
ally any eBay page.
A login page appears. 
2. Type your User ID and password and click Sign In Securely. 
The My eBay page appears. 
3. Click Personal Information under the My Account heading in the links
on the left-hand side of the page. 
The My eBay Account: Personal Information page appears. 
4. Scroll down to the About Me link, and click Change. 
The About Me page appears. 
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Create My Page. 
The Choose Page Creation Option page appears. 
6. Leave the Use Our Easy Step-By-Step Process option selected, and click
Continue.
The About Me: Enter Page Content page appears. 
7. As indicated on the page, type a heading and text for your page. Label
your photo and enter the URL for the photo in the Link to Your Picture
text box. You can also type links to favorite pages and your own Web
page if you have one. When you’re done, click Continue. 
The Preview and Submit page appears, as shown in Figure 10-2.
8. Choose one of three possible layouts for your page, and preview your
page content in the bottom half of the page. When you’re done, click
Submit. 
Your page goes online.
Like any Web page, you can change your About Me page at any time by fol-
lowing the preceding steps. 
Another way to ensure a good reputation as a seller is to participate actively
in eBay’s discussion boards. Pay special attention to boards that pertain to
the type of merchandise you buy and sell. Responding to questions from new
users and offering advice based on your experience will boost your standing
within the user community. 
216

Preparing Sales Descriptions That Sell
How do you actually go about selling on eBay? The aim is similar to other forms
of e-commerce: You select some merchandise, take photos, type descriptions,
and put the descriptions online in a catalog. But there are some critical differ-
ences as well. You don’t have to specify a fixed price on eBay; as described
earlier in this chapter, you can set a starting bid and see how much the market
will bear. All sales descriptions are not created equal, however. Many sellers
would argue that clear, sharp photos are the most important part of a descrip-
tion, and that, if you show the item in its best light photographically, it will
practically sell itself. I’m of the opinion that a good heading and descriptions
that include critical keywords are just as important as good photos. The art
of creating descriptions is best discovered by inspecting other people’s sales
listings; the essentials are described in the sections that follow. 
Details, details
The primary way of getting your sales online is eBay’s Sell Your Item form.
You can access this form at any time by clicking Sell on the eBay navigation
bar, which appears at the top of just about any page on the eBay Web site.
The Sell Your Item form is easy to use, so I don’t step you through every
nuance and option. In this section, however, I do point out a few features you
might overlook and that can help you get more attention for your sales.
Figure 10-2:

217
Chapter 10: Running a Business on eBay

The Sell Your Item form is by no means the only way to get eBay sales online.
Many full- or part-time businesspeople use special software that allows them
to upload multiple images at once or schedule multiple sales so they all start
and end at the same time. The auction services Andale (www.andale.com)
and SpareDollar (www.sparedollar.com) offer eBay auction listing tools. In
addition, eBay offers two programs you might find helpful:
 Turbo Lister (pages.ebay.com/turbo_lister/index.html), which
is free, provides sellers with design templates that they can use to add
graphic interest to their sales descriptions. 
 Selling Manager (pages.ebay.com/selling_manager/index.html),
a monthly subscription service, is sales and management software.
It provides you with convenient lists that let you track what you have
up for sale, which sales have ended, which items have been purchased,
and what tasks you have yet to do — for instance, sending e-mails to
winning bidders or relisting items that didn’t sell the first time.
Choosing a second category
One of the first things you do in the Sell Your Item form is to choose a sales
category in which to list your item. I highly recommend using the search box
at the top of the Select Category page. Enter a keyword and click Find. You’re
presented with a detailed list of sales categories. The best thing about the list
is that it is ranked in order of the ones that are most likely to sell items match-
ing your desired keywords. The categories near the top of the list are the ones
to choose. 
I also recommend paying an extra dollar or so (when you choose a second cat-
egory, your listing fee is doubled) and listing the item in a second category —
especially if the second category has a percentage ranking that’s almost as
high as the first. 
Focusing on your auction heading
The heading of an eBay sales description is the set of six or seven words that
appears in a set of search results or in a set of listings in a category. In other
words, it’s the set of words that a potential customer initially sees when he
or she is deciding whether to investigate a sale and possibly bid on it. Keep
your heading short and specific. Include dates, colors, or model numbers if
applicable. Try to pick one word that might attract a buyer, such as Rare,
Hard-to-Find, Mint, New, or something similar. 
Choosing a good ending time for your sale
With eBay sales, it’s not the starting time that counts but the ending time that
makes a difference. The more attention you can get at the end of a sale, the
more likely you are to make a profit. Most sales get attention on weekends,
when the majority of shoppers aren’t working. The optimal time, in fact, is
to have the sale end some time on a Saturday night or Sunday afternoon. 
218
Part III: Successful Online Business Models 

Of course, bidders can come from all over the world, and what’s Sunday after-
noon in California is Monday morning in Australia. But don’t worry too much
about such distinctions: Pick an ending time that’s convenient for eBay shop-
pers in your own country to be present — not in the middle of a workday, but
on the weekend. 
Adding keywords
When you prepare an auction description, you don’t have to make it overly
lengthy. It’s not the length that counts; it’s the number of keywords you
include. A keyword is a word or phrase that describes the item you have for
sale and that prospective buyers are likely to enter in their eBay searches. If
your description contains a keyword that someone enters, your sale will
show up in search results. And just showing up in the search results is half
the battle: If a buyer can find your item, he or she can then follow through
with its purchase. 
The more keywords you can add to your description, the more frequently
that sale will be found by searchers. It’s to your advantage, then, to think of
all the terms that someone would use when looking for your item, and add as
many of those keywords to the heading and to the body of the description as
you can. If you’re selling an electric drill, for example, use keywords such as
cordless, electric, 3/8-inch, Black & Decker, or anything else a likely buyer
might enter. 
Upgrading your listings
Near the end of the Sell Your Item form, a series of items gives you the option
to specify whether or not you want to upgrade your listings. Upgrade, in this
case, means adding graphic highlights that are intended to help your listing
stand out from those around it, either in search results or on category pages.
You can choose from the options shown in Table 10-2.

219
Chapter 10: Running a Business on eBay

Of these, the single most cost-effective upgrade, in my opinion, is the Gallery
thumbnail image, which costs only a quarter and calls more attention to your
sales listing — especially when you consider that most other listings around
yours also have Gallery images. The Home Page may be expensive, but it gives
you a chance of having your sale on eBay’s home page and guarantees expo-
sure for your sale on featured areas. 
In eBay’s early days, if you wanted a sale to end at a particular time (say, 7 p.m.
on a Sunday evening, when lots of bidders are available), you had to physically
be present to create the description at a certain time. For instance, if you
wanted such a sale to last seven days, you had to list it at precisely 7 p.m.
the preceding Sunday. Now, you don’t have to be physically present exactly
a week, five days, three days, or one day before you want your sale to end:
You can specify an ending time when you fill out the Sell Your Item form.
Note: Although it’s free to register for an account on eBay and free to fill out
the Sell Your Item form, eBay charges you an Insertion Fee when you actually
put an item up for sale. The Insertion Fee is based on the starting price of the
auction. The fee is only $.35 for a starting bid of $9.99 or less, which explains
why most starting bids are less than $10. A Final Value Fee is also charged at
the end of the auction, and it depends on the sale price. On a sale of $100, the
Final Value Fee is $3.41; at $1,000, it is $28.12. For a detailed explanation of the
formula used to calculate fees, see pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html. 
Include clear images
No matter how well written your auction’s headings and description, all of
your work can quickly be undone by digital images that are dark, blurry, or
that load too slowly because they are too large in either physical or file size.
The same principles that you use when capturing digital images for your 
e-commerce Web site apply to eBay images: Make sure that you have clear,
even lighting (consider taking your photos outdoors); use your camera’s
auto-focus setting; crop your images so that they focus on the merchandise
being sold; and keep the file size small by adjusting the resolution with your
digital camera or your image editing software.
Some aspects to posting images along with auction descriptions are unique
to eBay: 
 Image hosting: If you run a business on eBay and have dozens or even
hundreds of sales items online at any one time, you can potentially have
hundreds of image files to upload and store on a server. If you use eBay
Picture Services as your photo host, the first image for each sale is free.
Each subsequent image costs 15 cents. It’s worth your while to find an
economical photo hosting service, such as Pixhost (www.pixhost.com)
or Auction-Images (auction-images.com). 
220
Part III: Successful Online Business Models 

 Close-ups: If what you’re selling has important details such as brand
names, dates, and maker’s marks, you need to have a camera that has
macro capability — that is, the ability to get clear close-ups. Virtually all
digital cameras have a macro setting, but it can be tricky to hold the
camera still enough to get a clear image (you may need to mount the
camera on a tripod). If you use a conventional film camera, you’ll need
to invest in a macro lens. 
 Multiple images: You’ll never hear an eBay shopper complaining
that you included too many images with your auction listings. As
long as you have the time and patience and an affordable image host,
you can include five, six, or more views of your item (for big objects
like automobiles and other vehicles, multiple images are especially 
important). 
Be sure to crop and adjust the brightness and contrast of your images after you
take them, using a program such as Paint Shop Pro by Jasc (www.jasc.com)
or Adobe Photoshop Elements by Adobe Systems (www.adobe.com). 
If you want to find out more about creating sales descriptions (and practically
every aspect of buying or selling on eBay, for that matter) take a look at my
book, eBay PowerUser’s Bible (Wiley).
Be flexible with payment options
It might seem like payments are the most nerve-wracking part of a transac-
tion on eBay. They have been, in the past; but as time goes on, eBay provides
more safeguards for its customers. That doesn’t mean you won’t run into the
occasional bidder who won’t respond after winning your auction, or whose
check bounces. But as a seller, you have plenty of protections: If someone
doesn’t respond, you can relist your item; if someone’s check bounces, you
don’t lose out on your sales item because you will have held on to it during
the process of having the check clear. 
As an eBay seller, you should accept the basic forms of payment: personal
checks, cashier’s checks, and postal money orders. You can also enable your
customers to pay with a credit card, either by using your merchant credit card
account if you have one (see Chapter 12), or by using one of two popular elec-
tronic payment services (or both): eBay’s own PayPal (www.paypal.com) or
BidPay (www.bidpay.com), which is a service of Western Union. In the case
of PayPal, you are charged a nominal fee (2.2 to 2.9 percent of the amount plus
a 30-cent fee) when a buyer transfers money electronically to your account.
In the case of BidPay, it’s the buyer who pays for a paper money order, which
is then mailed to you, the seller.
221
Chapter 10: Running a Business on eBay

You should generally not accept other forms of payment from buyers. Occa-
sionally, a buyer will insist on sending you cash in an envelope; you should
insist, in turn, that the buyer sends a money order instead. COD is expensive
and cumbersome; it makes the delivery service responsible for collecting your
money, and if the buyer isn’t home when the delivery people arrive, you might
have to wait a long time to get paid. 
Providing Good Customer Service
When you make the decision to sell on eBay on a regular basis, you need to
develop a good reputation. Earlier in this chapter, I outline ways that you can
do that. But one of the best ways to achieve that goal — providing a high level
of customer service to your buyers — is an issue that warrants a separate
discussion. The single best way to do that is to be responsive to e-mail inquiries
of all sorts. This means checking your e-mail at least once a day and spending
lots of time typing messages. If you take days to get back to someone who asks
you about the color or the condition of an item you have for sale, it might just
be too late for that person to bid. And slow response to a high bidder or buyer
after the sale can make the buyer nervous and result in “neutral” feedback —
not a complaint about fraud or dishonesty, but a note about poor service.
Such feedback is considered as bad as a negative comment on eBay. 
Setting terms of sale
One aspect of good customer service is getting back to people quickly and
communicating clearly and with courtesy. When you receive inquiries, you
should always thank prospective customers for approaching you and consid-
ering the sale; even if they don’t end up placing bids, you will have spread
goodwill. 
Another way to be good to your customers is to be clear about how you plan
to ship your merchandise and how much it will cost. When you fill out the
Sell Your Item form (which I discuss further in the earlier section, “Details,
details”), you can specify either an actual shipping cost (a cost based on
weight and the buyer’s residence) or a flat shipping fee (a shipping fee you
charge for all of your items). 
The moment you specify a shipping charge in the Sell Your Item form, you set
eBay’s automated Checkout system in motion. The Checkout system enables
buyers to calculate their own shipping charges. The advantage to you, as the
seller, is that you don’t need to send your buyers a message stating how
much they need to pay you. 
222
Part III: Successful Online Business Models 

Packing and shipping safely
One of the aspects of selling on eBay that is often overlooked (not by buyers)
is the practice of packing and shipping. After sending out payment for some-
thing, buyers often wait on pins and needles, eagerly hoping to receive their
items while dreading a unresponsive seller who refuses to ship what has been
purchased. Besides the danger of fraud, there’s the danger that the item you
send will be damaged in transit. 
Be sure to use sturdy boxes when you ship and that you take care to ade-
quately cushion your merchandise within those boxes. I’ve received boxes
from sellers who stuffed the insides with bubble wrap and newspaper, and I
was happy for the trouble. If you are shipping something particularly fragile,
consider double-boxing it: Put it in a box, place the box in a larger one, and
put cushioning material between the two. Your customers will be pleased to
receive the merchandise undamaged, and you’ll get good feedback as a result. 
Place a thank-you note, business card, or even a small gift inside the box with
your shipment. It will spread good feelings and remind buyers how to get in
touch with you in the future. 
Moving from Auctioneer 
to eBay Businessperson
eBay sellers don’t start out saying, “I’m going to be a PowerSeller, and I’m
going to sell full time on eBay for a living!” Rather, they typically start out on
a whim. They find an object lying around in a box, in the attic, or on a shelf,
and they wonder: Will anyone pay money for this? 
That’s what happened to Kimberly King, a housewife living in Longmont,
Colorado. Back in March 2000, she was cleaning up around the house when she
found an old purse. “I thought, ‘Gee, should I sell this?’ I didn’t have enough
stuff to hold a garage sale. I’d heard about eBay, so I thought I would see what
it was like to sell something. I found out just how easy it was to set up an ID
and to register. I ended up getting $20 for the purse, which was much more
than I would have at a garage sale. I was hooked.”
After she felt comfortable selling on eBay, a new thought popped up: “You start
thinking, ‘Let’s see, that thing sold, what else do we have that we can sell?’
When I really saw that I could do this on a regular basis, I thought, ‘I can do
this all the time; I can have some fun money.’” 
223
Chapter 10: Running a Business on eBay

Opening an eBay Store
An eBay Store is a Web site within eBay’s own voluminous Web empire. It’s a
place where sellers can post items for sale at fixed prices. The great advantage
of having a store is that it enables a seller to keep merchandise available for
purchase for 30, 60, 90, or even an unlimited number of days at a time. It gives
customers another way to buy from you, and it can significantly increase your
sales, too. eBay itself, at a recent eBay Live event, made the claim that eBay
Stores brought about a 25 percent increase in overall sales. (Kimberly King,
the PowerSeller profiled below, says her store accounts for perhaps 55 to 60
percent of her sales.)
224
Part III: Successful Online Business Models 
PowerSeller keeps sales going 
with a little help from her friends
PowerSeller status is something that many
eBay sellers strive for, and Kimberly King is no
exception. After she started selling on a regular
basis, she decided to try for the coveted icon.
“When I realized that I could do this, I had to do
a little more research about what I was selling,”
she says. “Having not been in sales before, I
found that there are some strategies you have
to follow and some things you have to hunt for,
like a wholesale supplier.”
Having a steady stream of merchandise to buy
at wholesale and then resell on eBay is impor-
tant for PowerSellers, who are required to
maintain at least $2,000 in gross sales each
month in order to keep their PowerSeller icon.
This requirement does put some pressure on a
seller, King says. “I do put some pressure on
myself to keep my PowerSeller status. I feel I
have to list a certain number of items, and be
available for people constantly. You have more
people you are helping and working with.” 
A housewife and mother, King has to fit her eBay
activities in between errands, childcare, and
many other responsibilities. Still, she manages
to spend as much as six hours on the auction site
each day. She takes her own photos of each of
her sales items even though her wholesaler has
offered stock photos because, she says, shop-
pers need to see exactly what they are buying.
“Right now I am striving to list ten sales online
per day. It’s hard to remember to do this your-
self, so some other sellers and I have decided
to be ‘listing buddies.’ We remind each other
every day that we need to keep up our quota;
that way, we’re accountable to someone.”
Over the years she’s had her share of great prof-
its among her 2,000-plus sales: an autographed
item by Mickey Mantle that she bought for only $5
sold for $80; some Navajo rugs sold for more than
$800. More than half of her sales are antiques,
coffee, and products made with the herbal
sweetener Stevia sold in her Higher-Groundz
eBay Store (stores.ebay.com/Higher-
Groundz, shown in the following figure). 
Having items up for sale for a month or more at a
time helps King maintain her PowerSeller sales
quotas. “If one of my kids is home from school
sick and I can’t do something that week, I have
those sales in my store. It’s not like I completely
left eBay that week.” 

An article in E-Commerce Times describes different strategies for getting
your eBay Store listed in many of the major search engines. You can read the
article at www.ecommerce-guide.com/news/news/article.php/3385011.
Striving for PowerSeller status
PowerSellers are among the elite on eBay. Those members who have the cov-
eted icon next to their names feel justifiably proud of their accomplishments.
They have met the stringent requirements for PowerSellers, which emphasize
consistent sales, a high and regular number of completed sales, and excellent
customer service. Moving from occasional seller to PowerSeller is a substan-
tial change. Requirements include 
225
Chapter 10: Running a Business on eBay
One of the best sources of support and help has
been the member-created discussion forums
called eBay Groups. “When you find something,
you can post a message on the PowerChicks
group asking, ‘Hey I found this neat thing at a
garage sale, does anyone know what this is?’”
King says. “Those discussion boards have been
so helpful because you get information from
really knowledgeable sellers.”

 At least 100 unique feedback results — 98 percent of which are positive
 A minimum of $1,000 of average gross monthly sales for three consecu-
tive months
 A good standing record — achieved by complying with eBay Listing Policies 
 A current account — achieved by contacting bidders within three busi-
ness days and upholding the eBay Community Values
In return for the hard work required to meet these standards, PowerSellers do
get a number of benefits in addition to the icon. These include group health
insurance; merchandise with a special logo on it, free banner ads, a special
discussion board just for PowerSellers, and more.
The PowerSeller program isn’t something you apply for. eBay reviews your
sales statistics and invites you to join the program when you have met the
requirements. You can find out more about the requirements and benefits of
the PowerSeller program at pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/
welcome.html. 
Finding lots of merchandise to sell
Moving up to PowerSeller status means an ongoing commitment to conduct-
ing a large number of sales, responding quickly to customers, and shipping
efficiently. It also means finding a steady and reliable stream of merchandise
to sell. When you need to get 50 or more items up for sale each week, garage
sales quickly become impractical for all but the most dedicated. Many
PowerSellers manage to find sufficient inventory by heading to estate sales in
teams, showing up in the predawn hours and waiting in line, and then buying
as many things as they can grab when they scurry through a house. Others
find a wholesale supplier who can provide them with low-cost items such as
figurines, coffee, or holiday decorations in bulk. 
Finding a wholesale supplier
All the PowerSellers I’ve spoken to in recent years have assured me that it’s
not easy to find a reputable, reliable wholesaler. They urge other sellers to
do their homework by getting references and talking to satisfied customers.
Many wholesalers are primarily interested in taking sellers’ money and not
providing good service, they say. Often, finding wholesalers is a matter of
word of mouth: You ask someone who knows someone, and so on. Kimberly
King (the seller I profile in the “PowerSeller keeps sales going with a little
help from her friends” sidebar) used connections left over from her former
management position at an herbal tea company to find a supplier. 
“You’re not going to find someone on eBay who is going to tell you their
wholesaler,” she cautions. “They’re too valuable. My advice is to make sure to
call and check out references; do everything you can to find out everything
about a company. Some force you to make an initial order of maybe $1,000 min-
imum up front, knowing when you see the product you’ll never order it again.”

ike fish in the ocean, your potential customers are
out there — more of them, in fact, than you can begin
to count. Part III tells you everything you need to know to
reel them in — hook, line, and sinker.
When you run an online business, you need to develop
special strategies for getting attention and standing out
from the millions of other sites that are your competitors.
This means researching your market, delivering on your
promises, and making sure that your customers are satis-
fied with your goods and services. It means exploring all
the options for advertising and publicity that are available
to you, optimizing your search engine visibility, making the
shopping and payment experience a breeze, and choosing
an effective marketing strategy that best meets your needs.
Nothing’s more frustrating, after all, than feeling a nibble on
your line and then having to content yourself with telling
your friends about the one that got away.

N
othing can compare to the emotional thrill you feel when you start up
your own new business and get it online. Nothing, that is, but the real
excitement of getting paid for what you do. A pat on the back is nice, but it’s
even better to receive the proverbial check in the mail or have funds trans-
ferred to your business account.
When you are in an online business, there are two important components to
doing financial transactions. In the first place, you have to go through some
extra steps to make the customer feel secure so that you will be paid promptly
and reliably. You also need to protect yourself financially. It’s nice to know that,
because e-commerce has been around for a few years, you have your choice
of experts, services, and online tools that make your job easier. Even though
independence may be one of the factors that you like most about running
your own online business, you have plenty of demands on your attention and
getting help is the sensible way to go.
For example, the technical side of starting up a site doesn’t have to be your
concern. You don’t have to spend years studying to be a programmer. Plenty
of utilities are available to help you create Web pages, make links, keep your
books, and do other tasks online.
Time is on your side in this case because the range of software “shortcuts” is
becoming larger and more user friendly. You can create forms that will process
data and send it to you. You can keep track of your business expenses online,
create banner ads and animations, hold videoconferences, and more. In this
chapter, I suggest practices that you can implement to reduce your business
time-to-market as well as ways to share information more efficiently. Every
hour you save by taking advantage of these services is an hour you can spend
on another part of your business, or even relaxing. 

Here is a short list of what you need to do to be a successful e-commerce
businessperson: set up the right atmosphere for making purchases, provide
options for payment, and keep sensitive information private. Oh, and don’t
forget that your main goal is to get goods to the customer safely and on time.
In this chapter, I describe ways in which you can implement these essential
online business strategies.
Attracting and Keeping Online Customers
You’ve heard it before, but I can’t emphasize enough the importance of
understanding the needs and habits of online shoppers and doing your best
to address them. When it comes to e-commerce, there is a direct correlation
between meeting the needs of your customers and having a healthy balance
in your bank account.
Seeing your merchandise is the first step
Customers may end up buying an item in a brick-and-mortar store, but
chances are that they saw it online first. In fact, they often aren’t interested
until they read a detailed description. More and more shoppers are assuming
that legitimate stores will have a Web site and an online sales catalog.
“It’s not enough to just say we have this or that product line for sale. Until we
actually add an individual item to our online store, with pictures and prices,
we won’t sell it,” says Ernie Preston, who helped create an 84,000-item online
catalog for a brick-and-mortar tool company profiled later in this chapter. “As
soon as you put it in your online catalog, you’ll get a call about it. Shopping
on the Web is the convenience factor that people want.”
Don’t hesitate to post as many items as possible on your online catalog and
don’t scrimp on the amount of detail that you include about each item. For
more and more businesses, having an online catalog is becoming an integral,
not peripheral, part of their identity. 
Tell me that the price is right, right now
Customers may have a lot of questions to ask you, but what they want to
know first and foremost is how much an item costs. Be sure to put the cost
right next to the item that you’re presenting. Searching through a price list
will lose the competitive edge of speed and convenience, which is what Web
shoppers want most. They don’t have the patience to click through several
pages. Chances are that they are comparison shopping and in a hurry.

Microsoft Office 2003, the widely used suite of applications that includes
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, gives you access to some clip art images that
help highlight sales items. Figure 11-1 shows an example of how you can edit
an HTML Web page file with Word by inserting an image from the Clip Art pane.
(You can find more clip art images at the Microsoft Office Clip Art and Media
Center, office.microsoft.com/clipart/default.aspx).
Show me that I can trust you!
Trust is the foundation on which every good relationship is built, and building
trust is especially important for an online business. Electronic commerce is
still in its early days, and many customers still have fears like these:
 How do I know that someone won’t intercept my name, phone number, or
credit card information and use the data to make unauthorized purchases?
 How can I be sure that your online business will actually ship me what I
order and not “take the money and run?”
 Can I count on you not to sell my personal information to other busi-
nesses that will flood me with unwanted e-mail?

To get an in-depth look at how customers shop online and what constitutes
“good” and “bad” shopping for many people, consult Buying Online For
Dummies (Wiley), by Joseph Lowery.
How do you build trust online? If you run an eBay Store, you have the advan-
tage of being able to display a feedback rating, and customers can look up
comments left on the site by the people with whom you have done business.
If you’re not on eBay, you can still publish comments from satisfied customers.
And you need to state your policies clearly and often. Tell people that you
value their business and will do everything you can to protect their personal
information. Assure them that you won’t give out any customer’s data with-
out that person’s consent. If you plan to accept credit card orders, be sure to
get an account with a Web host that provides a secure server, which is software
that encrypts data exchanged with a browser.
If you’re a member in good standing of the Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.
org), you may be eligible to join the BBBOnLine program (www.bbbonline.

participate in the BBBOnLine program show their commitment to their cus-
tomers by displaying a BBBOnLine Reliability Seal or Privacy Seal on their
Web sites. Consumers can click the BBBOnLine seal to view a Better Business
Bureau company profile on the participating business.
Give me the essentials; 
show me the products
Remember that one of the big advantages of operating a business online is
space. You have plenty of room in which to provide full descriptions of your
sale items. You also have no reason to skimp on the details that you provide
about your business, your products, and your services. Here are some sug-
gestions of how to provide information that your customer may want:
 If you sell clothing, include a page with size and measurement charts.
 If you sell food, provide weights, ingredients, and nutritional information.
 If you sell programming, Web design, or traditional graphic design, 
provide samples of your work, links to Web pages you’ve created, and
testimonials from satisfied clients.
 If you’re a musician, publish a link to a short sound file of your work.
Don’t be reluctant to tell people ways that your products and services are
better than others. Visit the Lands’ End online catalog (www.landsend.com)
for good examples of how this well-established marketer describes the quality
of its wares.

Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Looking for a Good Web Host: The 411
Time and again, I hear successful entrepreneurs extol the virtues of the 
companies that enable their businesses to go online. Why all the praise?
Some Web hosting services or ISPs go beyond the basic tasks of providing
space on a Web server and keeping the server functioning smoothly.
If you’re a computer novice or just technically challenged, look for a full-service
host that can help set up a Web site, make it easy to process forms or run
scripts, and perform similar tasks. One of the best shortcuts to success is to
find a good Web host, and then depend on that company’s software tools and
service reps when you need help building your Web site.
Before you sign up with a host, check out customer service options. Specifically,
find out when the service staff is available by telephone. Also ask if telephone
support costs extra. If you’re working alone and don’t have a technical person
you can call, being able to speak to a technical support person about a prob-
lem you’re encountering on your site can be invaluable.
It may seem surprising to think of your Web host as one of the reasons for
your success. After all, you do most of the work. At the most basic level, a
hosting service is just a company that provides you with space on a server.
You call them only when you have a problem or a billing question. At least,
that’s how most people look at their Web host.
However, whether you use the server space given to you by your ISP or sign
with a full-time Web host, the relationship can be much more.
For example, pair Networks (www.pair.com), which offers a pretty typical
selection of hosting options and which has been praised by some technical
writers I know, offers the following kinds of e-commerce services that go
above and beyond the basic hosting arrangements, which range from $9.95 to
$49.95 per month:
 Secure server: You can pay an extra charge and have your site hosted
on a secure server (a computer that encrypts traffic) so that you can
protect the information that your customers send you.
 Shopping cart: For an extra $9.95 per month, you can add ShopSite
shopping cart functionality to your site. (See Chapter 3 for more about
ShopSite.)
 Credit card authorization: For an extra $15 per month plus a $39 setup
fee, customers can set up credit card processing and address checking
through the Authorize.net payment program. (See Chapter 12 for more
information on setting up online credit card systems.)
233
Chapter 11: Easing the Shopping Experience

 Dedicated server: The basic hosting option for almost all hosting ser-
vices is to put your site on a computer that hosts many different Web
sites. In other words, you’re on a shared server. When traffic to your site
gets really heavy, you can get your own, dedicated server. The dedicated
server options that pair Networks offers start at $249 per month, but
you get unlimited telephone support as well as faster access for your
customers because you’re running your own server.
Don’t get locked in to a two- or three-year contract with a Web host. Go
month to month or sign a one-year contract. Even if you’re initially happy
with your host, this gives you a chance to back out and go elsewhere if the
company takes a turn for the worse or your needs change.
Domain name registration
People frequently get confused when I try to explain how to register a domain
name and how to “point” the name at the server that hosts their Web sites.
This is a perfect place for an ISP to help you. In addition to giving you an
Internet connection and Web server space, some ISPs also function as domain
name registrars: The ISP provides a service that enables anyone to purchase
the rights to use a domain name for one, two, or more years. It’s a kind of
one-stop shopping: You can set up your domain name and, if the same com-
pany hosts your site, you can easily have the name associated with your site
instead of having to go through an extra step or two of pointing the name at
the server that holds your site.
By pointing your domain name at your server, I mean the following: You pur-
chase the rights to a domain name from a registrar. You then need to associate
the name with your Web site so that, when people connect to your site, they
won’t have to enter a long URL such as username.home.mindspring.com.
Instead, they’ll enter www.mybusiness.com. To do this, you tell the registrar
that your domain name should be assigned to the IP address of your server.
Your ISP or Web host will tell you the IP address to give to the registrar.
When you’re registering your site, don’t focus solely on the dot-com (.com)
domain. Some new domains have been made available that can provide you
with alternate names in case your ideal dot-com name is unavailable. Even if
you do get a dot-com name (.com is still the most recognizable and desirable
domain name extension), you may want to buy up the same name with .biz,
.info, or .tv at the end so that someone else doesn’t grab it.
Marketing utilities
Some people are great at promotion and marketing. Others excel at detail
work. Only a few lucky people can do both kinds of business tasks well and
234
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

enjoy it. If, like me, your promotional talents are a bit weak, find a hosting 
service that will help you get noticed.
Some hosts, such as Microsoft Small Business Center (www.microsoft.com/
smallbusiness/bc/default.mspx), give you access to a variety of market-
ing services if you sign with it as your host. Not all the services are free of
course. For instance, the Center’s optional List Builder marketing package
gives you access to a selection of Web page templates that enable you to
create your own newsletter and then send it to a mailing list of customers.
This service costs an extra $19.95 per month (after a 30-day free trial period)
in addition to the usual Small Business Center Web hosting fee of $12.95 per
month. (See the section about opening a Microsoft Small Business in Chapter 9
for a brief overview about hosting solutions that Microsoft offers.)
Catalog creators
Some of the biggest Web hosts (such as Yahoo! Small Business Merchant
Solutions, which I describe in Chapter 9) give you software that enables you
to create an online sales catalog by using your Web browser. In other words,
you don’t have to purchase a Web design program, figure out how to use it,
and create your pages from scratch.
On the downside, a Web-based catalog creation tool doesn’t give you the ulti-
mate control over how your pages look. You probably can’t pull off fancy
layout effects with tables or layers. (See Chapter 5 for more on using tables
and layers to design your site’s Web pages.) On the plus side, however, if you
have no interest in Web design and don’t want to pay a designer, you can use
one of these tools to save time and money by getting your pages online quickly
all by yourself.
Database connectivity
If you plan on selling only five, ten, or even twenty or so items at a time,
your e-commerce site can be a static site, which means that every time a 
customer makes a sale, you have to take the time to manually adjust inven-
tory. A static site also requires you to update descriptions and revise ship-
ping charges or other details by hand, one Web page at a time. In contrast, a
dynamic e-commerce site presents catalog sales items “on the fly” (dynami-
cally) by connecting to a database whenever a customer requests a Web
page. Suppose, for example, that a customer clicks a link for shoes. On a
dynamic site, the customer sees a selection of footwear gathered instantly
from the database server that’s connected to the Web site. The Web page
data is live and up-to-date because it’s created every time the customer
makes a request.
235
Chapter 11: Easing the Shopping Experience

If you need to create a dynamic Web site, another factor in choosing a Web
host is whether or not it supports the Web page and database software that
you want to use. For Doug Laughter of The Silver Connection, LLC (which I
profile in Chapter 3), the choice of host was essential. He wanted to develop his
site himself by using technologies he was familiar with and regarded highly:
Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) language and Macromedia UltraDev Web
site creation software. If you use a database program such as MySQL, for
instance, you may want to sign up with a Web host that allows you to run SQL
Server on one of its servers.
Payment plans
Handling real-time online transactions is one of the most daunting of all 
e-commerce tasks. Some Web hosts can facilitate the process of obtaining a
merchant account and processing credit card purchases made online. Yahoo!
Small Business Merchant Solutions, for one, says you can receive a merchant
account in just one to three days by applying through its site.
NTT/Verio, one of the best-known Web hosts/ISPs, has several hosting plans
especially for e-commerce Web sites. The company’s Gold Hosting Plan,
which costs $50 to set up and $99.95 per month, includes access to a
Merchant Payment Center as well as a shopping cart that you set up by fol-
lowing a tutorial. At the other end of the spectrum, a budget Web host called
Webmasters.com charges $9.95 per month for a Business Hosting account if
you pay for an entire year at once. The account includes access to a shopping
cart and credit card payment gateway. (You have to pay an extra $5 for the
use of a secure server that protects your customers’ credit card information
by encrypting it, however.) 
In any case, you still have to set up your Web site, catalog, and shopping cart
pages, and you still have to ship out your items and answer your customers’
questions. But having your Web host provide you with the sales and payment
tools and be available to answer your questions, removes part of the burden
of setting up a payment system.
Boosting Business through Efficient
Communication
In the earlier sections of this chapter, I show you how ISPs can help you
create catalogs, process payments, obtain domain names, and perform other
business tasks. However, sometimes the tasks that aren’t directly related to
marketing and sales can actually enable you to improve your profit margin by
236
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

giving you more time to do marketing and sales. If you can use the Internet to
communicate with vendors, co-workers, and other business partners, you
increase efficiency, which, in turn, enables you to take care of business.
Efficiency involves getting everyone on the same page and working together,
if not at the same time, at least at the right time. Standing in the hallway with
a megaphone and announcing a group meeting is going to disturb people
who are working — and besides, you’ll miss employees who are out running
errands or taking a lunch break.
A less intrusive tool for getting people together is an online personal informa-
tion manager (PIM). An online PIM provides the tools, such as a calendar, an
address book, a to-do list, and e-mail, so that members of a workgroup can
coordinate their schedules.
An example of an online PIM is ScheduleOnline (www.scheduleonline.com).
ScheduleOnline received high marks from the online news service CNET, par-
ticularly for its calendar, which enables multiple users to share lists of tasks
and meetings, as shown in Figure 11-2. Users can invite others to meetings
(guests confirm with a single click), send meeting announcements by e-mail,
and check for conflicts to ensure that everyone’s schedule has an opening
during the time selected.

Collaboration boosts efficiency
Health Decisions (www.healthdec.com), a
clinical research and development company
based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, manages
its internal operations plus an office in Oxford,
England, by taking advantage of the Internet. The
company posts its company’s benefits, travel,
and orientation information for new employees
on its intranet. Staff can also purchase travel
vouchers and record purchases made with
company credit cards online.
Improved communication and workflow —
thanks to e-mail, the intranet, and access to the
wider Internet — enables the company’s 80 staff
members to collaborate and communicate with
the aid of only two administrative staff. Health
Decisions doesn’t even have a receptionist.
CEO Michael Rosenberg estimates that Health
Decisions would require 5–7 additional people if
it used conventional communications. At an aver-
age salary of $35,000 plus benefits, he believes
the company’s intranet is saving them about
$175,000 to $245,000 per year.
“A lot of the administrative questions you get
are very predictable. How do I check the status
of my 401K plan or enter time for a project? We
try to put it all on our intranet. Why pay some-
one to do these repetitive tasks when we can
put the relevant information on the intranet, and
people can access the data quickly. We save
time; the employee saves time. I look on it as a
means of empowering people.”
The Internet also enables Health Decisions to
handle critical procedures far more quickly
when compared with industry standards:
 The time required to collect and enter data
into a database is only a matter of minutes,
in contrast to industry averages of any-
where between several hours and several
months.
 The error rate for databases is less than
one per 10,000 database fields, compared
with about 5 per 1,000 incurred by other
companies.
 The time required to submit one 10,000-page
regulatory application is three months, com-
pared with about a year for companies that
don’t collaborate online.
Health Decisions conducts tests of pharmaceu-
tical drugs. Such tests are expensive and col-
lect an extensive amount of data. It’s critical for
staff to get the data in the system quickly and
get the information in the field. When a study
has been completed, Health Decisions uses
standard forms stored on its intranet to present
the data, which is then submitted via the
Internet.
“We typically deal with project teams scattered
around the globe, and our system is designed to
collect, digest, and share information widely.
While a study is still being done, we can tell how
it’s progressing because the data is put on the
intranet in real time in a database,” says
Rosenberg. “We set up a Web site for each
study. At other organizations, it might take a
week to gather the data. On the Net, you can do
it instantly. Ultimately, we have shown that we
can reduce typical drug development timelines
by 20 percent or more.”

Making Sure Your Web Site 
Is Up to Snuff
It’s tempting to just get your Web site online, and then forget about it. It’s up
to your hosting service or ISP to monitor traffic and make sure everything’s
up and running. That’s their job, right?
It is their job, to be sure, but unless you keep an eye on your site and its avail-
ability to your customers, you may not be aware of technical problems that
can scare potential business away. If your site is offline periodically or your
server crashes or works slowly, it doesn’t just waste your customers’ time —
it can cut into your sales directly. Luckily, some shortcuts are available to
help you monitor your Web site and that don’t take a lot of time and effort
or technical know-how.
If your site doesn’t work well, another site whose pages load more quickly
can be found just a few mouse clicks away. Outages can be costly, too. Internet
Week reported back in 1999 that if the Dell Computer site was down for just
one minute, it would cost the hardware giant $10,000. A 90-minute outage
would cost the company nearly a million dollars — and the rate is probably
even higher these days.
Using software to monitor performance
A number of programs are available for between $30 and $200 that continually
keep an eye on your Web site and notify you of any problems. Such programs
take some effort to install. But the effort required to get them up and running
has a big benefit — you know about setbacks at least as soon as your customers
do, if not before.
WebCheck is a utility that monitors the performance of your Web site. It auto-
matically checks your site and alerts you if your site goes down or if a page
has been accidentally renamed or deleted. You configure WebCheck to check
your site’s URLs; you can have the program load the URLs once a minute, or
even once every second (faster checking may slow down your site’s perfor-
mance, however). You can be notified by e-mail, fax, popup browser window,
or taskbar icon. You can download WebCheck from the IT Utils Web site (www.
itutils.com). Another application, SiteScope, by Mercury Interactive Corp
(www.mercury.com/us/products/application-management/foundation/
monitors/sitescope), runs on Microsoft Windows 2003 or 2000 Server or
Windows NT 4.0, and checks sites every five to ten minutes.
239
Chapter 11: Easing the Shopping Experience

You don’t have to install your own software in order to monitor your Web
site’s performance, of course. You can sign up with a company that offers such
monitoring as a service. In this case, you use the company’s software, which
resides on its computers, not yours. For example, @Watch (www.atwatch.com)
provides an online service that checks your site’s images and links periodically
to see if everything is working correctly. The company offers several levels of
service. The @Watch Lite version costs $17.95 per month and checks your
site once every 60 minutes. Other versions can check your site as frequently
as every five minutes.
Dealing with service outages
Ideally, your Web host will provide a page on its Web site that keeps track
of its network status and records any recent problems. One site monitoring
notification (from a program you install yourself or one that you “rent” as a
service from an ASP — see the next section “Outsourcing Your Business
Needs”) probably shouldn’t be cause for concern. However, when you receive
a series of notifications, call your Web hosting service and talk to its technical
staff. Be courteous, but be specific. Tell technical support exactly what the
problems are/were. You may even want to print out the reports you receive
so that you can be aware of the exact nature of the problems. If you find that
such outages are occurring on a regular basis, exercise patience but be firm
in dealing with technical problems that have an impact on your business.
If the problem with your site is a slow response to requests from Web browsers
rather than a complete outage, the problem may be that your server is slow
because you’re sharing it with other Web sites. Consider moving from shared
hosting to a different option. In co-location, you purchase the server on which
your files reside, but the machine is located at your Web host’s facility rather
than at your own location. Your site is the only one on your machine. You
also get the reliability of the host’s technical support and high-speed Internet
connection.
If you really need bandwidth, consider a dedicated server. In this case, you rent
space on a machine that is dedicated to serving your site. This arrangement
is far more expensive than sharing a Web server, and you should choose it
only if the number of visits to your site at any one time becomes too great for
a shared server to handle. You’ll know a shared server is becoming overtaxed
if your site is slow to load. Discuss the situation with your host to see whether
a move to a dedicated server makes sense.
240
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Outsourcing Your Business Needs
One of the most effective ways to save time and money doing business online
is to let someone else install and maintain the computer software that you use.
Outsourcing is an increasingly common term, but in terms of e-commerce, it
refers to the practice of using an online service to perform various tasks for
you, such as Web hosting, form creation, or financial record keeping, rather
than installing software and running it on your own computer. Outsourcing
isn’t anything mysterious, however: It simply refers to the practice of having
an outside company provide services for your business.
241
Chapter 11: Easing the Shopping Experience
Videoconferencing: Being in two places at once
One of the best and most useful types of ASP-
based services you can use is videoconferenc-
ing, which can allow you to hold live meetings
with your customers or business partners by
using a Web-based conferencing service. It
works like this: Participants need a computer
that’s equipped with a microphone and a camera
that takes live video of them while they’re sitting
in front of their computers. They connect to a
central location on the Web — the conferenc-
ing service — by using their Web browsers.
After they’re connected to the same location on
the server, they can communicate in real time.
CMstat Corporation, a configuration and data
management software with offices in California,
Oregon, and Virginia, provides enterprise infor-
mation management software to businesses
around the world. Demos are essential for
clients to decide if they want to make a pur-
chase. In the past, CMstat would send a team
of employees to visit each prospective cus-
tomer one or more times. “We were making
approximately eight trips per month for a total
cost of $12,000,” says Tom Tesmer, president of
CMstat. “The challenge was how to increase
sales, shorten the sales cycle, and reduce
expenses. Additionally, we were looking for a
way to engage our customer support. CMStat
estimates that it reduced travel expenses for
sales and support by $26,000 the first year and,
through the use of the videoconferencing ser-
vice WebEx (www.webex.com) in its customer
support department, reduced support calls by
50 percent after that.
What’s that you say? You think that videocon-
ferencing is too difficult to set up and expensive
to use? WebEx, one of the leaders in the field of
Web-based conferencing, now offers a pay-as-
you-go plan. You can use the company’s ser-
vices for a whopping 20 cents per user per
minute. It’s a great way to try out the service to
see how it works for you. For more about using
WebEX, check out WebEx Web Meetings For
Dummies by Nancy Stevenson (Wiley).
Keep in mind, though, that the quality of any
real-time activity on the Web depends on the
speed of the participants’ respective Internet
connections. Because of time lags, videocon-
ferencing is really ideal for users with direct
connections, such as T1 or T3 lines, cable
modems, or DSL connections.

One of the companies that provides Web-based services on an outsourced
basis is called an Application Service Provider (ASP). An ASP is a company
that makes business or other applications available on the Web. You and
your co-workers can then use those applications with your Web browser
instead of having to purchase and install special software. For instance, when
you fill out a form and create a Web page on CafePress.com (which I describe
in Chapter 3), you’re using CafePress.com as an ASP. Rather than create your
Web page on your own computer by using a program, such as Microsoft
FrontPage, you use an application on the CafePress.com site, and store your
Web page information there.
How ASPs can help your company
You have to pay a monthly fee to use an ASP’s services. You may incur instal-
lation fees, and you may have to sign a one- or two-year contract. In return,
ASPs provide a number of benefits to your company. Here are the kinds of
business processes they can help you perform:
 Payroll and administration: AquaPrix, Inc. (www.aquaprix.com), a small
Hayward, California, water systems distribution company, outsources
some of its payroll functions to a company called QuikPay. AquaPrix,
which doesn’t have a large administrative staff, sends payroll data to
QuikPay, which calculates salary and issues checks to all employees for
about $100 per month.
 Tech support: ComponentControl (www.componentcontrol.com), a 
55-person company with offices in San Diego and New York, licenses
software that enables aerospace companies to locate and trade aviation
parts. Instead of having to travel all over the country to solve every
problem that users encounter with its software, ComponentControl’s
tech support staff use an online application called DesktopStreaming
that enables them to “see” the problem a customer is encountering.
ComponentControl can also show customers how to use the software
from its own offices, which saves on travel costs and has reduced the
time to solve problems by 30 percent.
 Online form creation: FormSite.com (www.formsite.com) is a leader in
creating a variety of forms that can help online shoppers provide such
essential functions as subscribing to newsletters or other publications,
asking for information about your goods and services, or providing you
with shipping or billing information. The sample pizza order form shown
in Figure 11-3 is an example of the type of form that this particular ASP
can help you create.
242
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

 Marketing and survey data gathering online: LeadMaster (www.lead
master.com) calls itself a “Web-based data mining tool.” You store your
customer information with LeadMaster, and LeadMaster provides you
with an online database that you can access any time with your Web
browser. It enables you to develop mailing lists based on your customer
database. You can use LeadMaster’s online tools to do sales forecasting
and develop surveys that give you a better idea of what your customers
need and want.
Another example of a small business that benefited from the services of ASPs
can be found on e-CommerceGuide.com (www.ecommerce-guide.com/
news/news/article.php/3385641). A Las Vegas-based computer seller
called DiscountLaptops.com chose an ASP called CORESense to handle
the processing of sales. CORESense does everything from ordering, billing,
invoicing, tech support, to updating databases. With only eight employees,
DiscountLaptops.com was able to triple its sales volume and boost revenues
from 1.8 million in 2000 to $4.5 million in 2003.

Although ASPs can help you in many ways, they require research, interview-

the extra effort make sense? I illustrate the potential pluses and minuses of

that the ASPs you work with use encryption

244
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

In many cases, ASPs can provide a software solution and customize it to your
needs. Outsourcing not only improves your company’s bottom line, but also
helps you convey your message to potential customers that you might never
reach otherwise.
ASPNews.com (www.aspnews.com) provides an overview of the current state
of the ASP industry. The ASPNews.com staff publishes regular articles about
ASPs and industry trends. The site also includes a directory of ASPs (links
manager.com/aspnews). To check out a very good ASPNews.com article on
what to look for in an ASP, go to the following URL:
www.aspnews.com/analysis/analyst_cols/article/
0,,4431_425751,00.html
Before you sign on the dotted line . . .
After you try out the software or other service that you want to lease (and
any reputable ASP should let you try it out first), you usually need to sign a
contract to keep using the service. This is the time to slow down and read
the fine print.
“It’s a huge commitment for people to go into an ASP arrangement,” says
Dana Danley, an analyst with Current Analysis of Reston, Virginia. “The
lengths of contracts can range from 12 to 50 months. Sometimes you can
choose the length of a contract, but most often you’re offered one contract.
It’s important not to get one that’s too long. You don’t even know for sure if
the ASP will be around in three years, for instance.”
Don’t be in a hurry, even if you’re experiencing the time-to-productivity pres-
sures, merger upheavals, or lack of IT resources that drive many companies
to outsource. In the following list, I present some suggestions to help you get
the service you think you’re getting:
 Understand pricing schemes: The pricing schemes that ASPs use to
charge for their Web-based services are downright confusing. For
instance, some ASPs charge on a “per-employee” basis, which means
you pay according to the number of individuals in your company. But
others charge “per-seat” fees based on each registered user, not every
employee. Still others charge “per-CPU,” which means you’re charged for
each machine that runs the hosted application. Make sure you under-
stand what your prospective ASP plans to charge by asking questions
and getting detailed information.
245
Chapter 11: Easing the Shopping Experience

 Pin down start-up fees: Virtually all ASPs charge a start-up fee, also
called a service implementation fee, when you sign the contract. Make
sure the fee covers installation and any customization that you’ll need.
 Don’t accept just any SLA: Obtaining a service level agreement (SLA),
a document that spells out what services you expect an ASP (or other
vendor) to provide, is essential. But regard the SLA as a dynamic docu-
ment. Don’t stand for the boilerplate. Think of SLA as standing for Stop,
Look, and Adjust.
Paula M. Hunter, vice-president of sales and marketing for cMeRun Corp
(an ASP) and the president of the ASP Industry Consortium, says, “The
SLA and/or hosting contract should outline additional monthly fees for
data backup and recovery (often these items are included). It’s also
important to review the contract regarding help desk support and any
fees which would be associated with placing support calls to the ASP.”
 Avoid “gotcha” fees: Pricing arrangements are hardly standard with
regard to ASPs. Some of the big hidden costs involve personalizing or
customizing the service to adapt to legacy systems. Here are some ques-
tions you can ask in order to avoid wincing at gotchas when you open
up the bill from your ASP:
• Is there an additional cost for customizing or personalizing the
application?
• Does it cost extra to back up my company’s data and recover it if
one of my computers goes down?
• Is help desk support included in my monthly fee, or will you charge
me every time I call with a question or problem?
 Make sure you have security: Having information reside on someone
else’s system is a double-edged sword. Putting this data on the Web makes
it accessible from anywhere. But some huge security risks are associated
with transmitting your information across the wide-open spaces of the
Net. Make sure that your ASP takes adequate security measures to protect
your data by asking informed questions, such as
• Is my data protected by SSL encryption?
• Do you run a virtual private network?
• How often do you back up your customers’ data?
If the answer to any of these questions seems inadequate, move on to
the next ASP — plenty are out there, and competition among ASPs is
fierce. So right now at least, it’s a buyer’s market, and you should be
able to get what you want.

Accepting Payments
In This Chapter
 Anticipating your online customers’ purchasing needs
 Applying for credit card merchant status
 Finding shortcuts to processing credit card data 
 Providing shoppers with electronic purchasing systems
 Delivering your products and services
S
tarting up a new business and getting it online is exciting, but believe me,
the real excitement occurs when you get paid for what you do. Nothing
boosts your confidence and tells you that your hard work is paying off like
receiving the proverbial check in the mail or having funds transferred to your
business account.
The immediacy and interactivity of selling and promoting yourself online
applies to receiving payments, too. You can get paid with just a few mouse
clicks and some important data entered on your customer’s keyboard. But
completing an electronic commerce (e-commerce for short) transaction isn’t
the same as getting paid in a traditional retail store. The customer can’t per-
sonally hand you cash or a check. Or, if a credit card is involved, you can’t
verify the user’s identity through a signature or photo ID.
In order to get paid promptly and reliably online, you have to go through some
extra steps to make the customer feel secure — not to mention protecting
yourself, too. Successful e-commerce is about setting up the right atmosphere
for making purchases, providing options for payment, and keeping sensitive
information private. It’s also about making sure that the goods get to the cus-
tomer safely and on time. In this chapter, I describe ways in which you can
implement these essential online business strategies.

Sealing the Deal: The Options
As anyone who sells online knows, the point at which payment is transferred
is one of the most eagerly awaited stages of the transaction. It’s also one of
the stages that’s apt to produce the most anxiety. Customers and merchants
who are used to dealing with one another face to face and who are accus-
tomed to personally handing over identification and credit cards suddenly
feel lost. On the Web, they can’t see the person they’re dealing with. 
For customers, paying for something purchased over the Internet is still
fraught with uncertainty, even though security is improving. For merchants
like you, it can still be nerve wracking; you want to make sure checks don’t
bounce and purchases aren’t being made with stolen credit cards. 
Your goal, in giving your customers the ability to provide payments online,
should be to accomplish the following: 
 Give the customer options. Online shoppers like to feel that they have
some degree of control. Give them a choice of payment alternatives:
phone, fax, check, and credit cards are the main ones. 
 Keep it secure. Pay an extra fee to your Web host in order to have your
customers submit their credit card numbers or other personal informa-
tion to a secure server — a server that uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption to render it unreadable if stolen. 
 Make it convenient. Shoppers on the Web are in a hurry. Give them the
Web page forms and the phone numbers they need so that they can
complete a purchase in a matter of seconds. 
Though the goals are the same, the options are different if you sell on eBay or
on a Web site other than eBay’s. If you sell on eBay, either through an auction
or an eBay Store, you can take advantage of eBay’s fraud protection measures:
a feedback system that rewards honesty and penalizes dishonesty; fraud insur-
ance; an investigations staff; and the threat of suspension. These safeguards
mean that it’s feasible to accept cash and personal checks or money orders
from buyers. If you don’t receive the cash, you don’t ship. If you receive
checks, you can wait until they clear before you ship. 
On the Web, you don’t have a feedback system or an investigations squad to
ferret out dishonest buyers. You can accept checks or money orders, but
credit cards are the safest and quickest option, and accordingly, they’re what
buyers expect. It’s up to you to verify the buyer’s identity as best you can in
order to minimize fraud.
248
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Enabling Credit Card Purchases
Having the ability to accept and process credit card transactions makes it
especially easy for your customers to follow the impulse to buy something
from you. You stand to generate a lot more sales than you would otherwise.
But although credit cards are easy for shoppers to use, they make your life as
an online merchant more complicated. I don’t want to discourage you from
becoming credit card ready by any means, but you need to be aware of the
steps (and the expenses) involved, many of which may not occur to you
when you’re just starting out. For example, you may not be aware of one or
more of the following:
 Merchant accounts: You have to apply and be approved for a special
bank account called a merchant account in order for a bank to process
the credit card orders that you receive. If you work through traditional
banks, approval can take days or weeks. However, a number of online
merchant account businesses are providing hot competition, which
includes streamlining the application process.
 Fees: Fees can be high but they vary widely, and it pays to shop around.
Some banks charge a merchant application fee ($300 to $800). On the
other hand, some online companies such as 1st American Card Service
(www.1stamericancardservice.com) or Merchants’ Choice Card
Services (www.vmc123.net) charge no application fee.
 Discount rates: All banks and merchant account companies (and even
payment companies like PayPal) charge a usage fee, deceptively called a
discount rate. Typically, this fee ranges from 1 to 4 percent of each trans-
action. Plus, you may have to pay a monthly premium charge in the range
of $30–70 to the bank. Although 1st American Card Service saves you
money with a free application, it charges Internet businesses a 2.29 per-
cent fee that it calls a discount rate, plus 25 cents for each transaction, a
$9 monthly statement fee, and a minimum charge of $20 per month.
 American Express and Discover: If you want to accept payments from
American Express and Discover cardholders, you must make arrange-
ments through the companies themselves. You can apply online to be
an American Express card merchant by going to the American Express
Merchant Homepage (www.americanexpress.com/homepage/
merchant.shtml) and clicking the Apply to Accept the Card link. 
At the Discover Card merchant site (www.discoverbiz.com), click
the Become a Merchant link, which leads you to the application for
credit card merchants.
249
Chapter 12: Accepting Payments

 Software and hardware: Unless you depend on a payment service such
as PayPal, you need software or hardware to process transactions and
transmit the data to the banking system. If you plan to accept credit
card numbers online only and don’t need a device to handle actual
“card swipes” from in-person customers, you can use your computer
modem to transmit the data. 1st American Card Service lets you use
software called PCCharge Express for processing transactions with your
browser, but you have to either purchase the software for $295 or lease
it for rates that vary from $22 to $34 per year. The hardware involved
is a terminal or phone line, which you can either purchase for $229 or
lease for anywhere from $17 to $26 per month, depending on the length
of the lease.
You also need to watch out for credit card fraud, in which criminals use stolen
numbers to make purchases. You, the merchant, end up being liable for most
of the fictitious transactions. Cardholders are responsible for only $50 of
fraudulent purchases. To combat this crime, before completing any transac-
tion, verify that the shipping address supplied by the purchaser is the same
(or at least in the same vicinity) as the billing address. If you’re in doubt, you
can phone the purchaser for verification — it’s a courtesy to the customer as
well as a means of protection for you. (See the later section, “Verifying credit
card data.”) You can do this check yourself or pay a service to do the checking.
Setting up a merchant account
The good news is that getting merchant status is becoming easier, as more
banks accept the notion that businesses don’t have to have an actual, physical
storefront in order to be successful. Getting a merchant account approved,
however, still takes a long time, and some hefty fees are involved as well. Banks
look more favorably on companies that have been in business for several
years and have a proven track record.
Traditional banks are reliable and experienced, and you can count on them
being around for a while. The new Web-based companies that specialize in
giving online businesses merchant account status welcome new businesses
and give you wider options and cost savings, but they’re new; their services
may not be as reliable and their future is less certain.
You can find a long list of institutions that provide merchant accounts for
online businesses at one of the Yahoo! index pages:

a Web-based merchant account company called goemerchant.com (www.
goemerchant.com) to set up and process its credit card transactions. This
company offers a shopping cart and credit card and debit card processing to
businesses that accept payments online. MyTexasMusic.com chose to use
goemerchant after an extensive search because it found that the company
would help provide reliable processing, while protecting the business from
customers who purchased items fraudulently.
One advantage of using one of the payment options set up by VeriSign Payment
Services (www.verisign.com/products/payment.html) is that the system
(which originated with a company called CyberCash) was well known and well
regarded before VeriSign acquired it. I describe the widely used electronic
payment company in the section, “Online Payment Systems,” later in this
chapter.
In general, your chances of obtaining merchant status are enhanced if you
apply to a bank that welcomes Internet businesses, and if you can provide
good business records proving that you’re a viable, moneymaking concern.
Be sure to ask about the discount rate that the bank charges for Internet-based
transactions before you apply. Compare the rate for online transactions to
the rate for conventional “card-swipe” purchases. Most banks and credit card
processing companies charge 1 to 2 extra percentage points for online sales.
Do you use an accounting program such as QuickBooks or MYOB Accounting?
The manufacturers of these programs enable their users to become credit card
merchants through their Web sites. See the “Accounting Software” section of
this book’s online Internet Directory for more information.
Finding a secure server
A secure server is a server that uses some form of encryption, such as Secure
Sockets Layer, which I describe in Chapter 7, to protect data that you receive
over the Internet. Customers know that they’ve entered a secure area when the
security key or lock icon at the bottom of the browser window is locked shut.

Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 
Keeping back-office functions personal
Mark Lauer knows the importance of credit card
verification and order processing. Yet he tries to
make these functions as personal as possible in
keeping with the spirit of online business.
Mark is president of General Tool & Repair, Inc., a
power tool supplier based in York, Pennsylvania.
General Tool has been in business for ten years,
but seven years ago, General Tool & Repair cre-
ated a simple Web page on America Online to
help promote the company. Within two weeks,
an order was received from a customer in Florida.
Since then, Mark has expanded his e-commerce
Web site with Microsoft Commerce Server, and
he set up shop at www.gtr.com.
Mark estimates that General Tool’s Web site
receives between 10 and 40 orders each day,
and average online sales amount to $35,000 to
$45,000 per month. He believes the site takes the
place of 50 salespeople. “This is all business we
never had until two years ago, so it’s basically
all extra sales for us,” he notes happily.
Q. How do you process credit card orders?
A. Our customers send us the credit card infor-
mation through our Web site, and our secure
server encrypts the data. But we don’t process
orders online. We first check to see if we have the
item in stock, and, if we do, we process the order
the next business day. That way, we don’t “slam”
the customer’s credit card without having the
item ready to ship out.
Q. How do you verify the identity of customers
who submit credit card numbers to you?
A. We use a program called Authorizer by Atomic
Software. The program lets you check the ship-
ping address against the address of the credit
card owner. If the two addresses are in the
same state, you’re pretty sure that you can ship
the item. Otherwise, you know that you’d better
e-mail the card owner and tell the person
there’s a problem. Sometimes, a customer will
want to purchase a gift and have it shipped out
of state to a family member, and in this case you
should also e-mail the customer just to be sure.
We have since upgraded to the multi-merchant
version of Authorizer, which lets us accept sev-
eral different types of credit cards.
Q.Do you get many fraudulent credit card orders?
A.We don’t get too many bogus orders. Normally,
you can tell because they don’t have the correct
“ship to” address. If we suspect something, we
e-mail or call the customer to confirm. Addition-
ally, Authorizer will detect fraudulent credit card
orders. Customers don’t mind you being extra
careful when dealing with their credit card pro-
tection, by confirming that it is a legit order. This
extra step has gained us many repeat customers.
Q. Whom do you use for shipping?
A. We get orders from countries like Japan and
Finland, and all over the United States, too. If the
customer is affiliated with the military, you’re
required to use the U.S. Postal Service for ship-
ping. If we’re shipping to a business address,
such as an office in New York City, we use United
Parcel Service because they give the option of
sending a package “signature required” which,
as it implies, requires someone to sign for an
item before they deliver it. We add the UPS
charge for “signature required” to the shipping
charge, but we feel that it’s worth it because we
don’t want any items to get lost because they
were left without a signature. There have been
many instances where a customer’s neighbor,
employee, or landlord have signed for their
package without the customer’s knowledge, so
it really provides protection for all involved.

If you plan to receive credit card payments, you definitely want to find a Web
hosting service that will protect the area of your online business that serves
as the online store. In literal terms, you need secure server software protect-
ing the directory on your site that is to receive customer-sent forms. Some
hosts charge a higher monthly fee for using a secure server; with others,
the secure server is part of a basic business Web site account. Ask your host
(or hosts you’re considering) whether any extra charges apply.
Verifying credit card data
Unfortunately, the world is full of bad people who try to use credit card 
numbers that don’t belong to them. The anonymity of the Web and the ability
to shop anywhere in the world, combined with the ability to place orders
immediately, can facilitate fraudulent orders, just as it can benefit legitimate
orders.
Protecting yourself against credit card fraud is essential. Always check the
billing address against the shipping address. If the two addresses are thousands
of miles apart, contact the purchaser by phone to verify that the transaction
is legit. Even if it is, the purchaser will appreciate your taking the time to
verify the transaction.
You can use software to help check addresses. Here are three programs that
perform this service:
 ClearCommerce (www.clearcommerce.com) sells both an automated
payment system and payment authentication software that work with
credit cards and banks. 
253
Chapter 12: Accepting Payments
Q. How do you tell your customers about ship-
ping options?
A. We offer customers three choices during the
purchase process: UPS ground, second-day air,
and next-day air. We also provide a comment area
where shoppers can make shipping requests or
provide us with special instructions regarding
their orders. That way, they can choose. We don’t
add on flat-rate shipping or handling charges
that might be excessive. There are only five of
us here, and I can’t justify charging someone
$25 shipping and handling for a $3 part for a
power tool. Our products vary a great deal in
price and weight, and we haven’t found a way
to provide a flat rate for shipping that is fair to
everyone, so each order is treated individually.
This flexibility in shipping has proven to be a
service that sets us apart from the “Big Box”
online power tool providers, and customers
shop our Web site because of it.

 PCCharge by GO Software Inc. (www.gosoftinc.com/products/
index.htm).
 ICVERIFY, which you can purchase from ICVERIFY at www.icverify.com
(call 1-800-666-5777 for current pricing on ICVERIFY).
Processing the orders
When someone submits credit card information to you, you need to transfer
the information to the banking system. Whether you make this transfer your-
self or hire another company to do it for you is up to you.
Do-it-yourself processing
To submit credit card information to your bank, you need POS (point of sale)
hardware or software. The hardware, which you either purchase or lease
from your bank, is a terminal — a gray box of the sort you see at many local
retailers. The software is a program that contacts the bank through a modem.
The terminal or software is programmed to authorize the sale and transmit the
data to the bank. The bank then credits your business or personal checking
account, usually within two or three business days. The bank also deducts the
discount rate from your account weekly, monthly, or with each transaction.
One payment processing program, PCCharge Express, can be obtained from
the GO Software Web site (www.gosoftware.com). You can install it on your
computer or use the online version. PCCharge for Windows 98 or later is
available for $295 or $34 per month for 12 months.
If you have a small-scale Web site — perhaps with only one item for sale — you
can use an online payment gateway, which enables you to add a “Pay Button”
to a catalog page that securely processes a customer’s payment information.
When you receive the information, you can manually submit it for payment by
using a program such as LinkPoint Central. The transaction is then processed
on one of LinkPoint’s secure servers. Both you and your customer receive
e-mail notifications that the transaction has been completed. You can find out
more on the Cardservice International Web site at www.aboutcsi.com/
secure-transaction-processing.html.
Automatic processing
You can hire a company to automatically process credit card orders for you.
These companies compare the shipping and billing addresses to help make
sure that the purchaser is the person who actually owns the card and not
someone trying to use a stolen credit card number. If everything checks out,
they transmit the data directly to the bank.
254
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

You can look into the different options provided by VeriFone, Inc. (www.
verifone.com) or AssureBuy (www.otginc.com) for such services.
Automatic credit card processing works so fast that your customer’s credit
card can be charged immediately, whether or not you have an item in stock. If
a client receives a bill and is still waiting for an item that is on back order, the
person can get very unhappy. For this reason, some business owners, such as
Mark Lauer (profiled in the sidebar, “Keeping back-office functions personal”),
chose not to use them.
Online Payment Systems
A number of organizations have devised ways to make e-commerce secure
and convenient for shoppers and merchants alike. These alternatives fall into
one of three general categories:
 Organizations that help you complete credit card purchases (for example,
VeriSign Payment Services).
 Escrow services that hold your money for you in an account until ship-
ment is received and then pay you, providing security for both you and
your customers.
 Organizations that provide alternatives to transmitting sensitive infor-
mation from one computer to another. A number of attempts to create
“virtual money” have failed. However, companies like Electracash
(www.electracash.com) let customers make payments by directly 
debiting their checking accounts.
In order to use one of these systems, you or your Web host has to set up 
special software on the computer that actually stores your Web site files.
This computer is where the transactions take place. The following sections
provide general instructions on how to get started with setting up each of
the most popular electronic payment systems.
To work smoothly, some electronic payment systems require you to set up
programming languages such as Perl, C/C++, or Visual Basic on your site.
You also have to work with techy documents called configuration files. This
is definitely an area where paying a consultant to get your business set up
saves time and headaches and gets your new transaction feature online more
efficiently than if you tackle it yourself. VeriSign, for instance, provides sup-
port in setting up systems for its merchants; you can find an affiliate to help
you or call the company directly. Visit the VeriSign Payment Processing page
(www.verisign.com/products/payment.html) for links and phone numbers.
255
Chapter 12: Accepting Payments

Shopping cart software
When you go to the supermarket or another retail outlet, you pick goodies off
the shelves and put them in a shopping cart. When you go to the cash register
to pay for what you’ve selected, you empty the cart and present your goods
to the cashier.
Shopping cart software performs the same functions on an e-commerce site.
Such software sets up a system that allows online shoppers to select items
displayed for sale. The selections are held in a virtual shopping cart that
“remembers” what the shopper has selected before checking out.
Shopping cart programs are pretty technical for nonprogrammers to set up,
but if you’re ambitious and want to try it, you can download and install a free
program called PerlShop (www.perlshop.org). Signing up with a Web host
that provides you with shopping cart software as part of its services, how-
ever, is far easier than tackling this task yourself.
A shopping cart is often described as an essential part of many e-commerce
Web sites, and Web hosts usually boast about including a cart along with
their other businesses services. But the fact is that you don’t have to use a
shopping cart on your site. Many shoppers are put off by them; they’re just
as likely to abandon a purchase than follow through by submitting payment.
Plenty of other e-businesses have users phone or fax in an order or fill out an
online form instead.
VeriSign payment services
The security company VeriSign, which is best known for selling certificates
that consumers can use to shop online, offers small businesses a variety of
online payment solutions.
VeriSign’s Payment Services page (www.verisign.com/products/payment.
html) includes services such as Payflow, which lets your company accept
payments online, and Commerce Site Services, which places your site on a
server that uses SSL encryption as well as certificates. (See Chapter 7 for
more detailed explanations of these security features.)
There’s no cost to try out one of the Payflow options for 30 days to see how
it works with your own business, but both options require that you have a
merchant account. (If you don’t have one, VeriSign suggests several financial
institutions to which you can apply.) The Payflow services do carry some
charges and require you to do some work, however:
256
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

 Payflow Link: The smallest and simplest of the VeriSign payment options,
Payflow Link is intended for small businesses that process 500 transactions
or fewer each month. You add a payment link to your online business
site, and you don’t have to do programming or other site development
to get the payment system to work. Payflow Link requires that you use
either Internet Explorer 3.0 (or later) or Netscape Navigator 4.0 (or later).
You pay a $179 setup fee and a $19.95 monthly fee.
 Payflow Pro: With this service, you can process up to 1,000 transactions
per month, and any additional transactions cost 10 cents each. To use
this option, you begin by installing the Payflow software on the server
that runs your Web site. The customer then makes a purchase on your
site, and the Payflow software sends the information to VeriSign, which
processes the transaction. Payflow Pro carries a $249 setup fee and
costs $59.95 per month.
You can sign up for a trial of either Payflow Link or Payflow Pro on the VeriSign
Payment Services page (www.verisign.com/products/payment.html).
PayPal
PayPal was one of the first online businesses to hit on the clever idea of giving
business owners a way to accept credit and debit card payments from cus-
tomers without having to apply for a merchant account, download software,
apply for online payment processing, or some combination of these steps.
PayPal is essentially an escrow service: it functions as a sort of financial middle-
man, debiting buyers’ accounts and crediting the accounts of sellers — and,
along the way, exacting a fee for its services, which it charges to the merchant
receiving the payment. The accounts involved can be credit card accounts,
checking accounts, or accounts held at PayPal into which members directly
deposit funds. In other words, the person making the payment sets up an
account with PayPal by identifying which account (credit card or checking,
for example) a payment is to be taken from. The merchant also has a PayPal
account, and has identified which checking or credit card account is to receive
payments. PayPal handles the virtual “card swipe” and verification of customer
information; the customer can pay with a credit card without the merchant
having to set up a merchant account. 
PayPal is best known as a way to pay for items purchased on eBay. eBay, in
fact, owns PayPal. But the service is regularly used to process payments both
on and off the auction site. If you want to sell items (including through your
Web site), you sign up for a PayPal Business or Premier account. You get a
PayPal button that you add to your auction listing or sales Web page. The
customer clicks the button to transfer the payment from his or her PayPal
account to yours and you’re charged a transaction fee.
257
Chapter 12: Accepting Payments

Setting up a PayPal account is free. Here’s how you can set up a PayPal
Business account:
1. Go to the PayPal home page (www.paypal.com), and click the Sign Up
Now button.
You go to the PayPal Account Sign Up page.
2. Click the button next to Business Account, choose your country of res-
idence, and click Continue.
The Business Account Sign Up page appears.
3. Follow the instructions on the registration form page, and set up your
account with PayPal.
After you’ve filled out the registration forms, you receive an e-mail mes-
sage with a link that takes you back to the PayPal Web site to confirm
your e-mail address.
4. Click the link contained in the e-mail message.
You go to the PayPal — Password page.
5. Enter your password (the one you created during the registration
process) in the Password box, and then click the Confirm button.
You go to the PayPal — My Account page.
6. Click the Merchant Tools tab at the top of the My Account page.
If you want to create a shopping cart, click the Shopping Cart link. For
the purposes of this exercise, click Buy Now Buttons.
7. Provide some information about the item you’re selling:
• Enter a brief description of your sales item in the Item Name/
Service box.
• Enter an item number in the Item ID/Number Box.
• Enter the price in the Price of Item/Service box.
• Choose a button that shoppers can click to make the purchase.
(You can choose either the PayPal logo button or a button that
you’ve already created.)
8. When you’re done, click the Create Button Now button.
You go to the PayPal — Web Accept page shown in Figure 12-1.
9. Copy the code in the For Web Pages box and paste it onto the Web
page that holds your sales item.
That’s all there is to it.

The nice thing about using PayPal is that the system enables you to accept pay-
ments through your Web site without having to obtain a merchant account. It
does put a burden on your customers to become PayPal users, but chances are
those who buy or sell on eBay already have one. The thing to remember is that
both you and your customers place a high level of trust in PayPal to handle your
money. If there is a problem with fraud, PayPal will investigate it — hopefully.
Some former PayPal users detest PayPal due to what they describe as a lack
of responsiveness, and they describe their unhappiness in great detail on sites
like www.paypalsucks.com. You should be aware of such complaints in order
to have the full picture about PayPal and anticipate problems before they arise.
Micropayments
Micropayments are very small units of currency that are exchanged by mer-
chants and customers. The amounts involved may range from one-tenth of
one cent (that’s $.001) to a few dollars. Such small payments enable sites to
provide content for sale on a per-click basis. In order to read articles, listen
to music files, or view video clips online, some sites require micropayments
in a special form of electronic cash that goes by names such as scrip or eCash.

Chapter 12: Accepting Payments

Micropayments seemed like a good idea in theory, but they’ve never caught on
with most consumers. On the other hand, they’ve never totally disappeared,
either. The business that proved conclusively that consumers are willing to
pay small amounts of money to purchase creative content online is none other
than the computer manufacturer Apple, which revolutionized e-commerce with
its iPod music player and its iTunes music marketplace. Every day, users pay
$.99 to download a song and add it to their iPod selections. But they make such
payments with their credit cards, using real dollars and cents. 
In other words, iTunes payments aren’t true micropayments. The micropay-
ment system is supposed to work like this:
1. As a vendor, you authorize a broker such as BitPass (www.bitpass.com)
to sell content to your customers by using its payment system. 
Typically, BitPass content is creative: cartoons, audiobooks, craft pro-
jects, and music. If a customer goes to your site and wants to purchase
articles or other content, the customer has to follow a few steps. 
260
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 
Reach for your wallet!
One of the terms commonly thrown around in
the jargon of e-commerce is wallet. A wallet is
software that, like a real wallet that you keep in
your purse or pocket, stores available cash and
other records. You reach into the cyberwallet
and withdraw virtual cash instead of submitting
a credit card number.
Wallets looked promising a few years ago, but
they have never really taken off. The idea is that a
cybershopper who uses wallet software, such as
Microsoft .NET Passport (www.passport.com),
is able to pay for items online in a matter of sec-
onds, without having to transfer credit card data.
What’s more, some wallets can even “remember”
previous purchases you have made and suggest
further purchases.
The problem with wallets is that shoppers just
aren’t comfortable with them. Credit cards are
quick and convenient, and they’ve proven to be
secure enough for most consumers. Consumers
who are committed to using Microsoft’s services
can use .NET Passport, which offers a “single
sign-in” to register or make purchases on sites
that support this technology. It also enables
consumers to create a wallet that stores their
billing and shipping information. (Credit card
numbers are stored in an offline database when
users sign up for a .NET Passport.) Customers
can then make purchases at participating sites
with the proverbial single mouse click. In order
for your online business Web site to support
.NET Passport, you need to download and install
the .NET Passport Software Development Kit
(SDK) on the server that runs your Web site. You
may need some help in deploying this platform; a
list of consultants as well as a link to the SDK is
included on the .NET Passport home page (www.
passport.net/Consumer/Default.asp).

2. The customer first purchases a prepaid card that contains a certain
amount of virtual money (say, $10) at face value from the broker.
(The purchase is made through PayPal, interestingly.) 
3. The broker then pays you, the merchant, the $10 purchase of virtual
money that the customer made, minus a service fee. 
4. The customer is then free to make purchases from your site by clicking
items that have been assigned a certain value (say, one or two cents). 
5. The micropayment service’s software causes the few cents to be automati-
cally subtracted from the user’s supply of scrip. No credit card numbers
are exchanged in these micropayment transactions.
Other payment options
A number of new online payment options have appeared that let people pay
for merchandise without having to submit credit card numbers or mail checks.
Here are some relatively new options to consider:
 iBill (www.ibill.com): A service of Internet Billing Corp., iBill provides
Web sites with a number of ways to accept online payments, including
an innovative system called Web900 (part of its iBillComplete service,
www.ibill.com/Services/iBillComplete) that enables customers
to have a transaction billed to their phone bills rather than their credit
cards.
 ClearTran (www.cleartran.com): This service enables shoppers to make
purchases by sending online checks to merchants. The shopper notifies
the seller about the purchase and then contacts a special secure Web
site to authorize a debit from his or her checking account. The secure
site then transmits the electronic check to the merchant, who can either
print out the check on paper or save the check in a special format that
can be transmitted to banks for immediate deposit.
Which one of these options is right for you? That depends on what you want
to sell online. If you’re providing articles, reports, music, or other content that
you want people to pay a nominal fee to access, consider a micropayment
system (see the preceding section). If your customers tend to be sophisti-
cated, technically savvy individuals who are likely to embrace online checks
or billing systems, consider iBill or ClearTran. The important things are to
provide customers with several options for submitting payment and to make
the process as easy as possible for them.
261
Chapter 12: Accepting Payments

Fulfilling Your Online Orders
Being on the Internet can help when it comes to the final step in the e-commerce
dance: order fulfillment. Fulfillment refers to what happens after a sale is made.
Typical fulfillment tasks include the following:
 Packing up the merchandise
 Shipping the merchandise
 Solving delivery problems or answering questions about orders that
haven’t reached their destinations
 Sending out bills
 Following up to see whether the customer is satisfied
Order fulfillment may seem like the least exciting part of running a business,
online or otherwise. But from your customer’s point of view, it’s the most
important business activity of all. The following sections suggest how you
can use your presence online to help reduce any anxiety your customers may
feel about receiving what they ordered.
The back-end (or, to use the Microsoft term, BackOffice) part of your online
business is where order fulfillment comes in. If you have a database in which
you record customer orders, link it to your Web site so that your customers
can track orders. Macromedia Dreamweaver or ColdFusion can help with
this. (The most recent versions, Dreamweaver MX and Dreamweaver MX
2004, contain built-in commands that let you link to a ColdFusion database.)
Provide links to shipping services
One advantage of being online is that you can help customers track packages
after shipment. The FedEx online order-tracking feature, shown in Figure 12-2,
gets thousands of requests each day and is widely known as one of the most
successful marketing tools on the Web. If you use FedEx, provide a link to its
online tracking page.
The other big shipping services have also created their own online tracking
systems. You can link to these sites, too:
 United Parcel Service (www.ups.com)
 U.S. Postal Service Express Mail (www.usps.gov)
 DHL (www.dhl-usa.com/home/home.asp)
262
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Present shipping options clearly
In order fulfillment, as in receiving payment, it pays to present your clients
with as many options as possible and to explain the options in detail.
Because you’re online, you can provide your customers with as much ship-
ping information as they can stand. Web surfers are knowledge hounds —
they can never get enough data, whether it’s related to shipping or other
parts of your business.
When it comes to shipping, be sure to describe the options, the cost of each,
and how long each takes. (See the sidebar called “Keeping back-office func-
tions personal,” earlier in this chapter, for some good tips on when to require
signatures and how to present shipping information by e-mail rather than on
the Web.) Here are some more specific suggestions:
 Compare shipping costs: Make use of an online service such as
InterShipper (www.intershipper.net), which allows you to submit
the origin, destination, weight, and dimensions of a package that you
want to ship via a Web page form and then returns the cheapest ship-
ping alternatives.
Figure 12-2:

263
Chapter 12: Accepting Payments

 Make sure that you can track: Pick a service that lets you track your
package’s shipping status.
 Be able to confirm receipt: If you use the U.S. Postal Service, ship the
package “return receipt requested” because tracking isn’t available —
unless you use Priority Mail or Express Mail. You can confirm delivery
with Priority Mail (domestic) and Parcel Post.
Many online stores present shipping alternatives in the form of a table or 
bulleted list of options. (Tables, as you probably know, are Web page design
elements that let you arrange content in rows and columns, making them easier
to read; refer to Chapter 3 for more on adding tables to your site.) You don’t
have to look very far to find an example; just visit the John Wiley & Sons Web
site (www.wiley.com) and order a book from its online store. When you’re
ready to pay for your items and provide a shipping address, you see the bul-
leted list shown in Figure 12-3.

t’s only human nature: Customers often wait until the last minute to request
a gift or other item for a specific occasion, and that leads to an emergency
for you. It may not seem fair, but a delay in responding to your customers can
lead to lost business. These days everything seems to be instant, from your
oatmeal to your Internet connection. Some shoppers still like to spend hours
or even days milling around the mall, browsing and lunching at their leisure.
But chances are that your customer is coming to you in the first place to save
time as well as money. 
Customer service is one area in which small, entrepreneurial businesses can
outshine brick-and-mortar stores and even larger online competitors. It doesn’t
matter whether you’re competing in the areas of e-trading, e-music, or e-tail
sales of any sort. Tools such as e-mail and interactive forms, coupled with the
fact that an online commerce site can provide information on a 24/7 basis, give
you a powerful advantage when it comes to retaining customers and building
loyalty.
What constitutes good online customer service, particularly for a new business
that has only one or two employees? Whether your customers are broadband
or dialup, you need to deal with them one at a time and connect one to one.
But being responsive and available is only part of the picture. This chapter
presents ways to succeed with the other essential components: providing
information, communicating effectively, and enabling your clientele to talk
back to you online.

The Best Customer Is an 
Informed Customer
In a manner of speaking, satisfaction is all about expectations. If you give
your customers what they are expecting or even a little bit more, they will be
happy. But how do you go about setting their level of expectation in the first
place? Communication is the key. The more information you can provide up
front, the fewer phone queries or complaints you’ll receive later. Printed pam-
phlets and brochures have traditionally described products and services at
length. But online is now the way to go.
Say you’re talking about a 1,000-word description of your new company and
your products and/or services. If that text were formatted to fit on a 4-x-9-inch
foldout brochure, the contents would cover several panels and take at least a
few hundred dollars to print.
On the other hand, if those same 1,000 words were arranged on a few Web
pages and put online, they’d probably be no more than 5K to 10K in size.
The same applies if you distribute your content to a number of subscribers
in the form of an e-mail newsletter. In either case, you need pay only a little,
or at least next to nothing, to publish the information.
And online publishing has the advantage of easier updating. When you add
new products or services or even when you want a different approach, it takes
only a little time and effort to change the contents or the look.
Why FAQs are frequently used
It may not be the most elegant of concepts, but it has worked for an infinite
number of online businesspeople and it will work for you. A set of frequently
asked questions (FAQs) is a familiar feature on many online business sites —
so familiar, in fact, that Web surfers expect to find a FAQ page on every busi-
ness site.
Even the format of FAQ pages is pretty similar from site to site, and this pre-
dictability is itself an asset. FAQ pages are generally presented in Q-and-A
format, with topics appearing in the form of questions that have literally been
asked by other customers or that have been made up to resemble real ques-
tions. Each question has a brief answer that provides essential information
about the business.
266
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Just because I’m continually touting communication doesn’t mean I want you
to bore your potential customers with endless words that don’t apply to their
interests. To keep your FAQ page from getting too long, I recommend that you
list all the questions at the top of the page. This way, by clicking a hyperlinked
item in the list, the reader jumps to the spot down the page where you present
the question that relates to them and its answer in detail.
Just having a FAQ page isn’t enough. Make sure that yours is easy to use and
comprehensive. Take a look at one of the most famous of the genre, the ven-
erable World Wide Web FAQ by Thomas Boutell (www.boutell.com/newfaq)
to get some ideas.
Sure, you could compose a FAQ page off the top of your head, but sometimes
getting a different perspective helps. Invite visitors, customers, friends, and
family to come up with questions about your business. You may want to
include questions on some of the following topics:
 Contact information: If I need to reach you in a hurry by mail, fax, or
phone, how do I do that? Are you available only at certain hours?
 Instructions: What if I need more detailed instructions on how to use
your products or services? Where can I find them?
 Service: What do I do if the merchandise doesn’t work for some reason
or breaks? Do you have a return policy?
 Sales tax: Is sales tax added to the cost I see on-screen?
 Shipping: What are my shipping options?
You don’t have to use the term FAQ, either. The retailer Lands’ End, which
does just about everything right in terms of e-commerce, uses the term Fact
Sheet for its list of questions and answers. Go to the Lands’ End home page
(www.landsend.com) and click the General Information link to see how Lands’
End presents the same type of material.
Writing an online newsletter
You may define yourself as an online businessperson, not a newsletter editor.
But sharing information with customers and potential customers through
an e-mail newsletter is a great way to build credibility for yourself and your
business.
For added customer service (not to mention a touch of self-promotion), con-
sider producing a regular publication that you send out to a mailing list. Your
mailing list would begin with customers and prospective customers who visit
your Web site and indicate that they want to subscribe.
267
Chapter 13: Service with a Virtual Smile

An e-mail newsletter doesn’t happen by magic, but it can provide your busi-
ness with long-term benefits that include:
 Customer tracking: You can add subscribers’ e-mail addresses to a mail-
ing list that you can use for other marketing purposes, such as promoting
special sales items for return customers.
 Low-bandwidth: An e-mail newsletter doesn’t require much memory. It’s
great for businesspeople who get their e-mail on the road via laptops,
palm devices, or appliances that are designed specifically for sending
and receiving e-mail.
 Timeliness: You can get breaking news into your electronic newsletter
much faster than you can put it in print.
The fun part is to name your newsletter and assemble content that you want
to include. Then follow these steps to get your publication up and running:
1. Create your newsletter by typing the contents in plain-text (ASCII)
format.
Optionally, you can also provide an HTML-formatted version. You can
then include headings and graphics that will show up in e-mail programs
that support HTML e-mail messages.
If you use a plain-text newsletter, format it by using capital letters; rules
that consist of a row of equal signs, hyphens, or asterisks; or blank spaces
to align elements.
2. Save your file with the proper filename extension: .txt for the text
version and .htm or .html if you send an HTML version.
3. Attach the file to an e-mail message by using your e-mail program’s
method of sending attachments.
4. Address your file to the recipients.
If you have lots of subscribers (many newsletters have hundreds or
thousands), save their addresses in a mailing list. Use your e-mail pro-
gram’s address book function to do this.
5. Send out your newsletter.
If you have a large number of subscribers, I recommend sending your publi-
cation late at night. It’s also a good idea to send it in several stages — that
is, to only so many subscribers at once — rather than all at one time. Those
are two good ways to help your words reach their destination quickly and
reliably.
Managing a mailing list can be time consuming. You have to keep track of
people who want to subscribe or unsubscribe, as well as those who ask for
more information. You can save time and trouble by hiring a company such
as SkyList (www.skylist.net) to do the day-to-day list management for you.

Mixing bricks and clicks
If you operate a brick-and-mortar business as well as a Web-based business,
you have additional opportunities to get feedback from your shoppers. Take
advantage of the fact that you meet customers personally on a regular basis,
and ask them for opinions and suggestions that can help you operate a more
effective Web site, too. 
When your customers are in the checkout line (the real one with a cash regis-
ter, not your online shopping cart), ask them to fill out a questionnaire about
your Web site. Consider asking questions like the following: 
 Have you visited this store’s Web site? Are you familiar with it? 
 Would you visit the Web site more often if you knew there was merchan-
dise or content there that you couldn’t find in our physical location? 
 Can you suggest some types of merchandise, or special sales, you’d like
to see on the Web site?
Including your Web site’s URL on all the printed literature in your store is a
good idea. The feedback system works both ways, of course: You can ask
online customers for suggestions of how to run your brick-and-mortar store
better, and what types of merchandise they’d like to see on your real as
opposed to your “virtual” shelves.
Helping Customers Reach You
I’m the type of person who has an unlisted home phone number. But being
anonymous is not the way to go when you’re running an online business. (I use
a different number for business calls, by the way.) Of course, you don’t have
to promise to be available 24/7 to your customers in the flesh. But they need to
believe that they will get attention no matter what time of day or night. When
you’re online, contact information can take several forms. Be sure to include
 Your snail mail address
 Your e-mail address(es)
 Your phone and fax numbers, and a toll-free number (if you have one)
Most Web hosting services (such as the types of hosts that I describe in
Chapter 3) give you more than one e-mail inbox as part of your account. 
So it may be helpful to set up more than one e-mail address. One address
can be for people to communicate with you personally, and the other can be
where people go for general information. You can also set up e-mail addresses
that respond to messages by automatically sending a text file in response.
(See the “Setting up autoresponders” section, later in this chapter.)
269
Chapter 13: Service with a Virtual Smile

Even though you probably won’t meet many of your customers in person, you
need to provide them with a human connection. Keep your site as personal
and friendly as possible. A contact page is a good place to provide some brief
biographical information about the people visitors can contact, namely you
and any employees or partners in your company.
Not putting your contact information on a separate Web page has some advan-
tages, of course. Doing so makes your patrons have to wait a few seconds to
access it. If your contact data is simple and your Web site consists only of a
few pages, by all means put it right on your home page.
Going upscale with your e-mail 
These days nearly everyone I know, including my parents, has an e-mail
account. But when you’re an online businessperson, you need to know more
about the features of e-mail than just how to ask about the weather or exchange
a recipe. The more you discover about the finer technical points of e-mail, the
better you’re able to meet the needs of your clients. The following sections
suggest ways to go beyond simply sending and receiving e-mail messages,
and utilize e-mail for business publishing and marketing.
Setting up autoresponders
An autoresponder, which also goes by the name mailbot, is software that you
can set up to send automatic replies to requests for information about a prod-
uct or service, or to respond to people subscribing to an e-mail publication
or service.
You can provide automatic responses either through your own e-mail program
or through your Web host’s e-mail service. If you use a Web host to provide
automatic responses, you can usually purchase an extra e-mail address that
can be configured to return a text file (such as a form letter) to the sender.
Look for a Web host that provides you with one or more autoresponders along
with your account. Typically, your host assigns you an e-mail address that
takes the form info@mycompany.com. In this case, someone at your hosting
service configures the account so that when a visitor to your site sends a
message to info@yourcompany.com, a file of your choice, such as a simple
text document that contains background information about you and your ser-
vices, automatically goes out to the sender as a reply. My own Web host and
ISP, XO Communications, lets me create and edit an autoresponse message
for each of my e-mail accounts. First, I log on to my host’s gateway, which is
the service it provides customers for changing their e-mail settings. I click
the link Edit E-mail Settings to go to the page called E-mail Settings shown in
Figure 13-1. I check the Auto Respond box to turn the feature on and then click
Edit Autoresponse Message to set up my autoresponse text. 
270
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

If the service that hosts your Web site does not provide free autoresponders,
look into SendFree, an online service that provides you with autoresponder
service for free but that requires you to display ads along with your automatic
response. (An ad-free version is available for $19.97 per month.) Read about
it at www.sendfree.com.
Noting by quoting
Responding to a series of questions is easy when you use quoting — a feature
that lets you copy quotes from a message to which you’re replying. Quoting,
which is available in almost all e-mail programs, is particularly useful for
responding to a mailing list or newsgroup message because it indicates the
specific topic being discussed.
How do you tell the difference between the quoted material and the body of
the new e-mail message? The common convention is to put a greater-than (>)
character in the left margin, next to each line of the quoted material.
When you tell your e-mail software to quote the original message before you
type your reply, it generally quotes the entire message. To save space, you
can snip (delete) out the part that isn’t relevant. However, if you do so, it’s
polite to type the word <snip> to show that you’ve cut something out. A
quoted message looks something like this:

Attaching files
A quick and convenient way to transmit information from place to place is
to attach a file to an e-mail message. In fact, attaching files is one of the most
useful things you can do with e-mail. Attaching, which means that you send a
document or file along with an e-mail message, allows you to include material
from any file to which you have access. Attached files appear as separate
documents that recipients can download to their computers.

Adding the personal touch that means so much
Sarah-Lou Reekie started her business out of an
apartment in London, England in 1997. She devel-
oped an herbal insect repellent called Alfresco
while working in a botanical and herbal research
center. Since then, sales have grown quickly —
often doubling each year. One key to Reekie’s
quick success is that there were no products in
direct competition with her lotion. Another key
component is her personal approach to serving
her customers, who include movie stars on loca-
tion and other prominent entertainers like Sir
Paul McCartney.
Reekie’s Web site (www.alfresco.uk.com),
shown in the accompanying figure, nearly dou-
bled sales, but she stuck to basic business prac-
tices and focused on cultivating the customer
base she had already developed through selling
her product by word of mouth. (The trendy term
for this type of publicity is “viral marketing”; see
Chapter 15 for more on this topic.) She started a
fan club for Alfresco, and she has personally
visited some of her best customers.

Many e-mail clients allow users to attach files with a simple button or other
command. Compressing a lengthy series of attachments by using software
such as StuffIt or WinZip conserves bandwidth. Using compression is also a
necessity if you ever want to send more than one attached file to someone
whose e-mail account (such as an AOL account) doesn’t accept multiple
attachments.
Protocols such as MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) are sets of
standards that allow you to attach graphic and other multimedia files to an
e-mail message. Recipients must have an e-mail program that supports MIME
(which includes almost all the newer e-mail programs) in order to download
and read MIME files in the body of an e-mail message. In case your recipient
has an e-mail client that doesn’t support MIME attachments, or if you aren’t
sure whether it does, you must encode your attachment in a format such as
BinHex (if you’re sending files to a Macintosh) or UUCP (if you’re sending
files to a newsgroup).

Q. How have you been able to keep a steady
flow of business amid the ups and downs of the
world economy?
A. We have built up a bigger and bigger cus-
tomer base by constantly giving good service to
customers. We send out special editions for fre-
quent buyers, have a fan club, and encourage
customers to make recommendations. We bring
out new and exciting products; we care and
look after our customers. We are about to do a
major refit on our site, as well.
Q. What are the one or two most important
things people should keep in mind if they are
starting an online business these days?
A. It is not necessary to spend fortunes to set it
up. Find a host that has been in business a
number of years. (There are experts now.) A
clean database that really works for you is vital,
as your customers are the most precious things
a business can have. Keep in touch with them.
Treat them with care and respect.
Q. What’s the single best improvement you’ve
made to your site to attract more customers or
retain the ones you’ve had?
A. Putting on a special code that only special
customers or fan club members can access for
discounts, etc. For example, Royal Bank of
Scotland employees have a special code dedi-
cated to them.
Q. Is this a good time to start an online business?
A. I actually feel it is a great time to start an e-
commerce biz for a number of reasons, not least
being that the technical support is now well and
truly in place. Let’s just say more people know
what they are doing than in earlier years.
Secondly, most new customers are not as con-
cerned about credit card security, as there really
has been hardly any fraud.
Q. What advice would you give to someone
thinking of starting a new business on the Web?
A. Your customer is King, Queen, Prince, and
Princess. Whatever you would like yourself is
what you should aim to offer. “Do as you would
like to be done by” should be your motto. Expose
yourself any which way and as often as is
acceptable to as many well-targeted customers
as possible. Most of all, keep a positive attitude.
Sir Paul McCartney once said to me when I felt
depressed and almost ready to give up, “Always
have faith.” I’m glad I listened to him!

Creating a signature file that sells
One of the easiest and most useful tools for marketing on the Internet is
called a signature file, or a sig file. A signature file is a text blurb that your
system automatically appends to the bottom of your e-mail messages and
newsgroup postings. You want your signature file to tell the readers of your
message something about you and your business; you can include informa-
tion such as your company name and how to contact you.
Creating a signature file takes only a little more time than putting your John
Hancock on the dotted line. First, you create the signature file itself, as I
describe in these steps:
1. Open a text-editing program.
This example uses Notepad, which comes built in with Windows. If you’re
a Macintosh user, you can use SimpleText. With either program, a new
blank document opens on-screen.
2. Press and hold down the hyphen (–) or equal sign (=) key to create a
dividing line that will separate your signature from the body of your
message.
Depending on which symbol you use, a series of hyphens or equal signs
forms a broken line. Don’t make this line too long or it will run onto another
line, which doesn’t look good; 30 to 40 characters is a safe measure.
3. Type the information about yourself that you want to appear in the
signature, pressing Enter after each line.
Include such information as your name, job title, company name, e-mail
address, and Web site URL, if you have one. A three- or four-line signature
is the typical length.
If you’re feeling ambitious at this point, you can press the spacebar to
arrange your text in two columns. My agent (who’s an online entrepreneur
himself) does this with his own signature file, as shown in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2:
A signature
file often
uses divider

space on-

274
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Always include the URL to your business Web site in your signature file
and be sure to include it on its own line. Why? Most e-mail programs will
recognize the URL as a Web page by its prefix (http://). When your
reader opens your message, the e-mail program displays the URL as a
clickable hyperlink that, when clicked, opens your Web page in a Web
browser window.
4. Choose File➪Save.
A dialog box appears, enabling you to name the file and save it in a
folder on your hard drive.
5. Enter a name for your file that ends in the filename extension .txt.
This extension identifies your file as a plain text document.
6. Click the Save button.
Your text file is saved on your computer’s hard drive.
Now that you’ve created a plain-text version of your electronic signature, the
next step is to identify that file to the computer programs that you use to
send and receive e-mail and newsgroup messages. Doing so enables the pro-
grams to make the signature file automatically appear at the bottom of your
messages. The procedure for attaching a signature file varies from program
to program; the following steps show you how to do this by using Microsoft
Outlook Express 6:
1. Start Outlook Express and choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box opens.
2. Click the Signatures tab.
3. Click New.
The options in the Signatures and Edit Signature sections of the
Signatures tab are highlighted.
4. Click the File button at the bottom of the tab, and then click Browse.
The Open dialog box appears. This is a standard Windows navigation
dialog box that lets you select folders and files on your computer.
5. Locate the signature file that you created in the previous set of steps
by selecting a drive or folder from the Look In drop-down list. When
you locate the file, click the filename, and then click the Open button.
The Signature File dialog box closes, and you return to the Options dialog
box. The path leading to the selected file is listed in the box next to File.
6. Click the Add Signatures to All Outgoing Messages check box, and
then click OK.
The Options dialog box closes, and you return to Outlook Express. Your
signature file will now be automatically added to your messages.
275
Chapter 13: Service with a Virtual Smile

To test your new signature file, choose File➪New➪Mail Message from the
Outlook Express menu bar. A new message composition window opens.
Your signature file should appear in the body of the message composition
window. You can compose a message by clicking before the signature and
starting to type.
Creating forms that aren’t formidable
In the old days, people who heard “here’s a form to fill out” usually started to
groan. Who likes to stare at a form to apply for a job or for financial aid or, even
worse, to figure out how much you owe in taxes? But as an online businessper-
son, forms can be your best friends because they give customers a means to
provide you with feedback as well as essential marketing information. Using
forms, you can find out where customers live, how old they are, and so on.
Customers can also use forms to sound off and ask questions.
Forms can be really handy from the perspective of the customer as well. The
speed of the Internet enables them to dash off information right away. They
can then pretty much immediately receive a response from you that’s tailored
to their needs and interests.
The two components of Web page forms
Forms consist of two parts, only one of which is visible on a Web page:
 The visible part includes the text-entry fields, buttons, and check boxes
that an author creates with HTML commands.
 The part of the form that you don’t see is a computer script that resides
on the server that receives the page. 
The aforementioned script, which is typically written in a language such as
Perl, AppleScript, or C++, processes the form data that a reader submits to a
server and presents that data in a format that the owner or operator of the
Web site can read and use.
How the data gets to you
What exactly happens when customers connect to a page on your site that
contains a form? First, they fill out the text-entry fields, radio buttons, and
other areas you have set up. When they finish, they click a button, often
marked Submit, in order to transmit, or post, the data from the remote com-
puter to your Web site.
A computer script called a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program receives
the data submitted to your site and processes it so that you can read it. The
CGI may cause the data to be e-mailed to you or it may present the data in a
text file in an easy-to-read format.
276
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Optionally, you can also create a CGI program that prompts your server
to send users to a Web page that acknowledges that you have received the
information and thanks them for their feedback. It’s a nice touch that your
customers are sure to appreciate.
Writing the scripts that process form data is definitely in the province of Web-
masters or computer programmers and is far beyond the scope of this book.
But you don’t have to hire someone to write the scripts: You can use a Web page
program (such as Microsoft FrontPage or Macromedia Dreamweaver) that not
only helps you create a form but also provides you with scripts that process
the data for you. (If you use forms created with FrontPage, your Web host must
have a set of software called FrontPage Server Extensions installed. Call your
host or search the host’s online Help files to see if the extensions are present.)
Some clever businesspeople have created some really useful Web content
by providing a way for nonprogrammers such as you and me to create forms
online. Appropriately enough, you connect to the server’s Web site and fill out
a form provided by the service in order to create your form. The form has a
built-in CGI that processes the data and e-mails it to you. See the “Free Forms
Online” section of the Internet Directory (on this book’s Web site) to find some
free form creation and processing services.
Using FrontPage to create a form
You can use the Form Page Wizard that comes with Microsoft FrontPage to
create both parts of forms: the data-entry parts (such as text boxes and check
boxes), as well as the behind-the-scenes scripts, called WebBots, that process
form data. Creating your own form gives you more control over how it looks and
a greater degree of independence than if you use a ready-made forms service.
The first step in setting up a Web page form is determining what information
you want to receive from someone who fills out the form. Your Web page cre-
ation tool then gives you options for ways to ask for the information you want.
Start FrontPage and choose Insert➪Form, and a submenu appears with many
options; the most commonly used options are the following:
 Textbox: This creates a single-line box where someone can type text.
 Text Area: This creates a scrolling text box.
 File Upload: This lets the user send you a text file.
 Checkbox: This creates a check box.
 Option Button: This creates an option button, sometimes called a radio
button.
 Drop-Down Box: This lets you create a drop-down list.
 Picture: This lets you add a graphic image to a form.
Figure 13-3 shows the most common form fields as they appear in a Web page
form that you’re creating.
277
Chapter 13: Service with a Virtual Smile

When you choose Insert➪Form, FrontPage inserts a dashed, marquee-style
box in your document to signify that you’re working on Web page form fields
rather than normal Web page text.
The Form Page Wizard is a great way to set up a simple form that asks for
information from visitors to your Web site. It lets you concentrate on the
type of data you want to collect rather than on the buttons and boxes needed
to gather it. I show you how to create such a form in the following steps.
(These steps are for FrontPage 2002; version 2003 requires similar steps,
but provides you with more options.)
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Microsoft FrontPage.
FrontPage starts and a blank window appears.
2. Choose File➪New➪Page or Web.
The New Page or Web task pane appears.
3. Click Page Templates.
The Page Templates dialog box appears.
4. Double-click Form Page Wizard.
The first page of the Form Page Wizard appears. (You can click Finish at
any time to see your form and begin editing it.)

5. Click Next.
6. Follow the instructions presented in succeeding steps of the wizard to
create your form.
a. Click Add, and then select from the set of options that the wizard
presents you with for the type of information you want the form
to present.
This may include account information, ordering information, and
so on.
b. Select specific types of information you want to solicit.
c. Choose the way you want the information to be presented.
You have options such as a bulleted list, numbered list, and so on.
d. Identify how you want the user-submitted information to be saved.
You can choose to save information as a text file, a Web page, or
with a custom CGI script if you have one.
7. Click Finish.
The wizard window closes and your form appears in the FrontPage
window.
When you finish, be sure to add your own description of the form and any
special instructions at the top of the Web page. Also add your copyright and
contact information at the bottom of the page. Follow the pattern you’ve set
on other pages on your site. You can edit the form by using the Forms sub-
menu options if you want to.
Be sure to change the background of the form page from the boring default gray
that the wizard provides to a more compelling color. See Chapter 5 for more
specific instructions on changing the background of Web pages you create.
Making Customers Feel That They Belong
In the old days, people went to the market often, sometimes on a daily basis.
The shopkeeper was likely to have set aside items for their consideration based
on individual tastes and needs. More likely than not, the business transaction
followed a discussion of families, politics, and other neighborhood gossip.
Good customer service can make your customers feel like members of a com-
munity that frequent a Mom-and-Pop store on the corner of their block — the
community of satisfied individuals who regularly use your goods and services.
In the following sections, I describe some ways to make your customers feel
like members of a group, club, or other organization who return to your site
on a regular basis and interact with a community of individuals with similar
interests.

Putting the “person” into personal service
How often does an employee personally greet you as you walk through the
door of a store? On the Web as well as in real life, people like a prompt and
personal response. Your challenge is to provide someone on your Web site
who’s available to provide live customer support.
Some Web sites do provide live support so that people can e-mail a question
to someone in real-time (or close to real-time) Internet technologies, such as
chat and message boards. The online auction giant eBay has a New Users
Board, for example, where beginners can post questions for eBay support
staff, who post answers in response.
An even more immediate sort of customer support is provided by chat, in
which individuals type messages to one another over the Internet in real
time. One way to add chat to your site is to start a Yahoo! Group, which I
describe later in this chapter.
LivePerson (www.liveperson.com) provides a simpler alternative that
allows small businesses to provide chat-based support. LivePerson is soft-
ware that enables you to see who is connected to your site at any one time
and instantly lets you chat with them, just as if you’re greeting them at the
front door of a brick-and-mortar store.
LivePerson works like this: You install the LivePerson Pro software on your
own computer (not the server that runs your site). With LivePerson, you or
your assistants can lead the customer through the process of making a pur-
chase. For instance, you might help show customers what individual sale items
look like by sending them an image file to view with their Web browsers. You
can try out LivePerson Pro for free for 30 days, and then pay $99 per month
thereafter.
Not letting an ocean be a business barrier
You’re probably familiar with terms such as “global village” and “international
marketplace.” But how do you extend your reach into the huge overseas mar-
kets where e-commerce is just beginning to come into its own? Making sure
that products are easily and objectively described with words as well as clear
images and diagrams, where necessary, is becoming increasingly important.
There are other ways to effectively overcome language and cultural barriers,
some of which are common sense while others are less obvious.
Keep in mind the fact that shoppers in many developing nations still prefer to
shop with their five senses. So that foreign customers never have a question
on how to proceed, providing them with implicit descriptions of the shopping
process is essential. You should make information on ordering, payment, exe-
cution, and support available at every step.

Customer support in Asia is, in many ways, a different creature than in the West.
While personalization still remains critical, language and translation gives an
e-commerce site a different feel. A Western site that might work well by look-
ing clean and well organized might have to be replaced with the more chaotic
blitz of characters and options that’s often found more compelling by Eastern
markets. In Asia, Web sites tend to place more emphasis on color and interac-
tivity. Many e-commerce destinations choose to dump all possible options on
the front page, instead of presenting them in an orderly, sequential flow.
Having a discussion area 
can enhance your site
Can we talk? Even my pet birds like to communicate by words as well as
squawks. A small business can turn its individual customers into a cohesive
group by starting its own discussion group on the Internet. Discussion groups
work particularly well if you’re promoting a particular type of product or if
you and your customers are involved in a provocative or even controversial
area of interest.
The three kinds of discussion groups are
 A local group: Some universities create discussion areas exclusively for
their students. Other large companies set aside groups that are restricted
to their employees. Outsiders can’t gain access because the groups aren’t
on the Internet but rather are on a local server within the organization.
 A Usenet newsgroup: Individuals are allowed to create an Internet-wide
discussion group in the alt or biz categories of Usenet without having to
go through the time-consuming application and approval process needed
to create other newsgroups.
 A Web-based discussion group: Microsoft FrontPage includes easy-to-use
wizards that enable you to create a discussion area on your business
Web site. Users can access the area from their Web browsers without
having to use special discussion-group software. Or, if you don’t have
FrontPage, you can start a Yahoo! Group, which I describe in the section
named (surprise!) “Starting a Yahoo! Group.”
Of these three alternatives, the first isn’t appropriate for your business pur-
poses. So what follows focuses on the last two types of groups.
In addition to newsgroups, many large corporations host interactive chats
moderated by experts on subjects related to their areas of business. But small
businesses can also hold chats, most easily by setting up a chat room on a
site that hosts chat-based discussions. But the hot new way to build goodwill
and establish new connections with customers and interested parties is an
interactive Web-based diary called a blog (short for Web log); find out more
about blogs in Chapter 4.

Chapter 13: Service with a Virtual Smile

Starting an alt discussion group
Usenet is a system of communication on the Internet that enables individual
computer users to participate in group discussions about topics of mutual
interest. Internet newsgroups have what’s referred to as a hierarchical struc-
ture. Most groups belong to one of seven main categories: comp, misc, news,
rec, sci, soc, and talk. The name of the category appears at the beginning
of the group’s name, such as rec.food.drink.coffee. In this section, I 
discuss the alt category, which is just about as popular as the seven I just
mentioned and which enables individuals — like you — to establish their
own newsgroups.
In my opinion, the biz discussion groups aren’t taken seriously because
they are widely populated by unscrupulous people promoting get-rich-quick
schemes and egomaniacs who love the sound of their own voices. The alt
groups, although they can certainly address some wild and crazy topics, are
at least as well known and often address serious topics. Plus, the process of
setting up an alt group is well documented.
The prefix alt didn’t originally stand for alternative, although it has come
to mean that. The term was an abbreviation for Anarchists, Lunatics, and
Terrorists, which wasn’t so politically incorrect back in those days. Now, alt
is a catchall category in which anyone can start a group, if others show inter-
est in the creator’s proposal.
The first step to creating your own alt discussion group is to point your Web
browser to Google Groups (groups.google.com) or launch your browser’s
newsgroup software. To start up Netscape’s newsreader, choose Window➪
Mail & Newsgroups, and then click the down arrow next to the name of your
newsgroup server. To start the Outlook Express newsgroup software, click
the plus sign next to the name of the newsgroup software in the program’s
Folders pane (both options assume you’ve already configured Outlook
Express to connect to your ISP’s newsgroup server) and access the group
called alt.config.newgroups. This area contains general instructions on
starting your own Usenet newsgroup. Also look in news.answers for the
message “How to Start a New Usenet Newsgroup.”
To find out how to start a group in the alt category, go to Google (www.
google.com), click Groups, and search for the message “How to Start an Alt
Newsgroup.” (You can also find this message at www.visi.com/~barr/alt-
creation-guide.html.) Follow the instructions contained in this message
to set up your own discussion group. Basically, the process involves the fol-
lowing steps:
282
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

1. You write a brief proposal describing the purpose of the group you
want to create and including an e-mail message where people can
respond with comments.
The proposal also contains the name of your group in the correct form
(alt.groupname.moreinfo.moreinfo). Try to keep the group name
short and official looking if it is for business purposes.
2. You submit the proposal to the newsgroup alt.config.
3. You gather feedback to your proposal by e-mail.
4. You send a special message called a control message to the news
server that gives you access to Usenet.
The exact form of the message varies from server to server, so you need
to consult with your ISP on how to compose the message correctly.
5. Wait a while (a few days or weeks) as news administrators (the people
who operate news servers at ISPs around the world) decide whether
to adopt your request and add your group to their list of newsgroups.
Before you try to start your own group, look through the Big 7 categories
(comp, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, and talk) to make sure that someone else
isn’t already covering your topic.
Starting a Yahoo! Group
When the Internet was still fresh and new, Usenet was almost the only game
in town. These days, the Web is pretty much (along with e-mail) the most
popular way to communicate and share information. That’s why starting a
discussion group on the Web makes perfect sense. A Web-based discussion
group is somewhat less intimidating than others because it doesn’t require a
participant to use newsgroup software.
Yahoo! Groups are absolutely free to set up. (To find out how, just go to the
FAQ page, help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/index.html, and click the
How Do I Start a Group? link.) They not only enable users to exchange mes-
sages, but they can also communicate in real time by using chat. And as the
list operator, you can send out e-mail newsletters and other messages to your
participants, too.
Simply operating an online store isn’t enough. You need to present yourself
as an authority in a particular area that is of interest. The discussion group
needs to concern itself primarily with that topic and give participants a
chance to exchange views and tips on the topic. If people have questions
about your store, they can always e-mail you directly — they don’t need a
discussion group to do that.
283
Chapter 13: Service with a Virtual Smile

Creating a Web discussion 
area with FrontPage
The reason that Microsoft FrontPage is such a popular tool for creating
Web sites is that it enables you to create Web page content that you would
otherwise need complicated scripts to tackle. One example is the program’s
Discussion Group Wizard, which lets you create Web pages on which your
members (as opposed to customers, remember?) can exchange messages
and carry on a series of back-and-forth responses (called threads) on different
topics. Newcomers to the group can also view articles that are arranged by a
table of contents and accessible by a searchable index.
Creating the discussion area
Follow these steps to set up your own discussion group with Microsoft
FrontPage:
1. Start FrontPage by choosing Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft
FrontPage.
The FrontPage window opens.
You can create a new discussion web (that is, a group of interlinked doc-
uments that together comprise a Web site) of Web pages by using one of
the built-in wizards that comes with FrontPage. 
2. To use the FrontPage Discussion Group Wizard, choose
File➪New➪Page or Web.
The New Page or Web task pane appears.
3. Click Web Site Templates.
The Web Site Templates dialog box appears.
4. Select Discussion Web Wizard and then click OK.
A dialog box appears, stating that the new discussion web is being cre-
ated. Then the first of a series of Discussion Web Wizard dialog boxes
appears.
5. Click Next.
The second dialog box lets you specify the features you want for your
discussion web. If this is the first time you’ve created a group, leave all
the options checked.
6. Click Next.
A dialog box appears that lets you specify a title and folder for the new
discussion web. Enter a title in the box beneath Enter a descriptive title
for this discussion. You can change the default folder name _disc1 if
you want.
284
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

7. Click Next.
The dialog box that appears lets you choose one of three options for the
structure of your discussion:
• Select Subject, Comments if you expect visitors to discuss only a
single topic.
• Select Subject, Category, Comments if you expect to conduct dis-
cussions on more than one topic.
• Select Subject, Product, Comments if you want to invite discussions
about products you produce and/or sell.
After you select one of these options, the next Discussion Web Wizard
dialog box appears. Go through this and the subsequent dialog boxes,
answering the questions they present you with in order to determine
what kind of discussion group you’re going to have. At any time, as you
go through the series of Discussion Web Wizard pages, you can click the
Finish button to complete the process.
8. When you’re done, the preset pages for your discussion web appear
in the FrontPage Explorer main window.
The middle column of the FrontPage window shows the arrangement of the
discussion documents. The right side of the window is a visual map that
shows how the discussion group is arranged and how the pages are linked to
each other.
When you set up a discussion area with FrontPage, you have the option of
designing your pages as a frameset, or a set of Web pages that has been sub-
divided into separate frames. To find out more about frames, see Chapter 5.
Editing the discussion pages
After you use the Discussion Group Wizard to create your pages, the next
step is to edit the pages so that they have the content you want. With your
newly created pages displayed in the FrontPage window, you can start editing
by double-clicking the icon for a page (such as the Welcome page, which has
a filename such as disc_welc.htm) in your discussion web. Whatever page
you double-click opens in the right column of the FrontPage window.
For instance, you might add a few sentences to the beginning of the Welcome
page that you have just created in order to tell participants more about the
purpose and scope of the discussion group. You can add text by clicking any-
where on the page and typing.
To edit more pages in your discussion group, choose File➪Open. The Open
File dialog box appears with a list of all the documents that make up your dis-
cussion group. You can double-click a file’s name in order to edit it. When you
finish editing files, choose File➪Save to save your work.
285
Chapter 13: Service with a Virtual Smile

To see how your discussion pages look, use the FrontPage Preview feature.
Choose File➪Preview in Browser, and the page you’ve been editing appears
in your browser window.
Posting your discussion area
The final step is to transfer your discussion web of pages from your own
computer to your Web host’s site on the Internet. Many Web hosting services
support one-step file transfers with Microsoft FrontPage. If you plan to use
FrontPage often, I recommend locating a host that offers this support. (If your
host doesn’t support such transfers, you need to use an FTP program such as
Fetch or WS_FTP to transfer your files.)
With one-step file transfers, you simply connect to the Internet, choose
File➪Publish Web from the FrontPage menu bar, and enter the URL of your
directory on your host’s Web server where your Web pages are published.
Click OK, and your files are immediately transferred.

T
he other day, I took some old radios to a local repair shop. The store has
been in business for more than three decades but never seemed to be
busy. This time, however, the owner told me he was overwhelmed with hun-
dreds of back orders and wouldn’t be able to get to my jobs for several weeks.
His store had just been featured on a local public television show, and now
people were driving long distances to bring him retro audio equipment to fix.
If you can get your business mentioned in just the right place, customers will
find you more easily. On the Web, search engines are the most important
places to get yourself listed. One of the key requirements for any business is
the ability to match up your products or services with potential customers
and to ensure that your company will show up in lots of search results and
that your site will be near the top of the first page. You do have a measure of
control over the quality of your placement in search results, and this chapter
will describe strategies for improving it. 
The Web analytics firm WebSideStory reported in 2003 (www.websidestory.
com/pressroom/pressreleases.html?id=181) that 13.4 percent of traffic
to Web sites came from search engines, up from 7.1 percent the year before.
Understanding How Search 
Engines Find You
Have you ever wondered why some companies manage to find their way to
the top of a page of search engine results — and occasionally pop up several
times on the same page — while others get buried deep within pages and pages

of Web site listings? In an ideal world, search engines would rank e-commerce
sites by how well designed they are and how responsive their owners are. But
with so many millions of Web sites crowding the Internet, the job of process-
ing searches and indexing Web site URLs and contents has to be automated.
Because it’s computerized, you can perform some magic with the way your
Web pages are written that can help you improve your placement in a set of
search results. 
Your site doesn’t necessarily need to appear right at the top of the first search
results page. The important thing is to ensure that your site appears before
that of your competition. In this chapter, you’ll discover different ways to use
search engines to your advantage. To begin, you need to think like a searcher,
which is probably easy because you probably do plenty of Web-based searches
yourself. How do you find the Web sites you want? Two things are of paramount
importance: keywords and links. 
Keywords are key
A keyword is a word describing a subject that you enter in a search box in
order to find information on a Web site or on the wider Internet. Suppose
you’re trying to find a source for an herbal sweetener called Stevia that low-
carb dieters like. You’d naturally enter the term Stevia in the search box on
your search service of choice, click a button called Search, Search Now, Go,
or something similar, and wait a few seconds for search results to be gathered. 
When you send a keyword to a search service, you set a number of possible
actions in motion. One thing that will happen for sure is that the keyword will
be processed by a script on a Web server that is operated by the search service.
The script will make a request (which is called, in computerspeak, a query)
to a database file. The database contains contents culled from millions (even
billions, depending on the service) of Web pages. 
The database contents are gathered from two sources. In some cases, search
services employ human editors who record selected contents of Web pages
and write descriptions for those pages. But Web pages are so ubiquitous and
changeable that most of the work is actually done by computer programs that
automatically scour the Web. These programs don’t record every word on
every Web page. Some take words from the headings; others index the first
50 or 100 words on a Web site. Accordingly, when I did a search for Stevia on
Google, the sites that were listed at the top of the first page of search results
had two attributes: 
 Some sites that had the word Stevia in the URL, such as www.stevia.net
or www.stevia.com. 
 Other sites had the word Stevia mentioned several times at the top of
the home page. 
288
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

A service called Wordtracker (wordtracker.com) does daily surveys of the
keyword queries made to various search engines. It creates lists of what it
finds to be the most popular search terms. It’s not likely those terms apply to
your own e-commerce Web site, of course. But if you want to maximize the
number of visits to your site, or just to make your site more prominent in a
list of search results, you may do well to know what’s trendy and write your
text accordingly. 
Adding your site’s most important keyword to the URL is one solution to better
search placement. But you can’t always do this. When it comes to keywords,
your job is to load your Web site’s headings with as many words as you can
find that are relevant to what you sell. You can do this by:
 Registering your site with one or more of the services (see the
“Registering your site with Google” section, later in this chapter).
 Burying keywords in the <META> tag in the HTML for your home page so
they won’t be visible to your visitors but will appear to the spider pro-
grams that index Web pages (see the “Adding keywords to your HTML”
section, later in this chapter).
 Adding keywords to the headings and initial body text on your pages, as
described in the “Adding keywords to key pages” section, later in this
chapter.
A keyword doesn’t have to be a single word. You can also use a phrase contain-
ing two or more words. Think beyond single words to consider phrases people
might enter when they’re trying to find products or services you’re offering.
Links help searchers connect to you
Keywords aren’t the only things that point search services to Web sites.
Services like Google keep track of the number of links that point to a site. The
greater the number of links, the higher that site’s ranking in a set of Google
search listings. It’s especially good if the URLs that form the links make use
of your keywords. Suppose your ideal keywords are “Greg’s Shoe Store.” The
ideal URL would be www.gregsshoestore.com, www.gregsshoestore.biz,
and so on. You could create the following HTML link to your e-commerce Web
site on a personal Web page, an eBay About Me page (see Chapter 10), or a
zShop on Amazon.com (see Chapter 9):
<a href=”http://www.gregsshoestore.com”> Visit Greg’s Shoe
Store </a>
Such a link would be doubly useful: A search service such as Google would
find your desired keywords (“Greg’s Shoe Store”) in the visible, clickable link
on your Web page, as well as in the HTML for the link. 
289
Chapter 14: Search Engine Placement

Don’t forget the human touch
I don’t want to suggest that search engines work solely by means of computer
programs that automatically scour Web pages and by paid advertisements.
Computer programs are perceived to be the primary source, but the human
factor still plays a role. Yahoo!, one of the oldest search engines around, origi-
nally compiled its directory of Web sites by means of real live employees.
These days, its Web directory (dir.yahoo.com) isn’t as easy to find on Yahoo!
as it once was. But editors still index sites and assign them to a category called
New and Notable Sites, which includes sites that are especially cool in some-
one’s opinion.
There’s almost no way to make sure that a human editor indexes your Web site.
The only thing you can do is to make your site as unique and content rich as
possible. And that will help your business not only show up in directories
and search results but also drum up more paying customers for you, too.
Taking the initiative: Paying for ads
You can’t get much better placement than right at the top of the first page of a
set of search results, either at the top of the page or in a column on the right
side. It’s even better if your site’s name and URL are highlighted in a color.
The only way to get such preferred treatment is to pay for it. And that’s just
what a growing number of online businesses are doing — paying search engines
to list their sites in a prominent location. See the “Paying for search listings
can pay off” sidebar, later in this chapter, for more information. 
Knowing who supplies the search results
Another important thing to remember about search engines is that they often
gather results from other search services. You may be surprised to find out
that, if you do a search of the Web on America Online, your search results
are primarily gathered from Google. That’s because AOL has a contract from
Google to supply such results. Not only that, but many search services are
owned by parent search services. Just what are the most popular search ser-
vices, and where do they get their results? A rundown appears in Table 14-1.
The services are presented in rank order, beginning in the first row with Google,
which is number 1. Rankings were reported by comScore Media Metrix in
May 2004.

The important thing to note about this table is that many of the most popu-

sites, but from other search services. If you pay for a listing with Google,
in other words, your ad is likely to appear not only on Google but also on
HotBot, Lycos, Teoma, AOL Search, and other places. By getting your site in
the Yahoo! database, you’ll appear in Yahoo! search results as well as MSN
Search. 
These are by no means the only search services around. Other search
engines focus on Web sites and Internet resources in specific countries.

Chapter 14: Search Engine Placement

Going Gaga over Google
When it comes to search engines, Google is at the top of the heap. In fact,
StatMarket (www.statmarket.com) reported in late 2004 that fully 41 percent
of all search referrals were being done by Google. The next highest competitor,
Yahoo!, had about 27 percent of the search market business. 
Google is a runaway success thanks to its effectiveness. You’re simply more
likely to find something on Google, more quickly, than you are on its competi-
tors. Any search engine placement strategy has to address Google first and
foremost. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore Google’s competitors.
Not long before this book was published, Microsoft came out with its own
Internet search engine, MSN Search. 
Googling yourself
If you want to evaluate the quality of your search results placement on Google,
you have to start by taking stock of where you currently stand. That’s easily
done: Just go to Google’s home page (www.google.com) and Google yourself.
(In other words, do a search for your own name or your business’s name — a
pastime that has also been called egosurfing.) See where your Web site turns
up in the results, and also make note of which other sites mention yours. 
Next, click Advanced Search or go directly to www.google.com/advanced_
search?hl=en. Under the heading Page-Specific Search, enter the URL for
your e-commerce site in the Links text box, and then click Search. The results
that appear in a few seconds consist of Web sites that link to yours. The list
should suggest to you the kinds of sites you should approach to solicit links.
It should also suggest the kinds of informational Web sites you might create
for the purpose of steering business to your Web site. (See the “Maximizing
links” section, later in this chapter, for a specific example.)
Playing Google’s game to reach #1
Not long ago, some bloggers got together and decided to play a game called
Google bombing. The game is simple: It consists of making links to a particu-
lar Web site in an attempt to get that site listed on Google. The more links the
site has pointing to it, the higher that site will appear in a set of search results.
Of course, the links that are made all have to be connected with a particular
keyword or phrase. In the game I’m recalling, one phrase used was “miserable
failure.” The words “miserable failure” were hyperlinks pointing to the Web site
of the White House. The story went that if you went to Google, typed the words
miserable failure and clicked the I’m Feeling Lucky button, you would be taken
to President Bush’s biography on the White House Web site. (Incidentally, if
292
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

you type those words and click Google Search rather than I’m Feeling Lucky,
the number two hit takes you to Jimmy Carter’s biography on the White House
Web site; the number three hit takes you to Michael Moore’s Web site.) You can
find out more about this interesting pastime on a Web site called The Word Spy
(www.wordspy.com/words/Googlebombing.asp). 
The Google game applies to your e-commerce Web site, too. Suppose you sell
yo-yos, and your Web site URL is www.yoyoplay.com. (This is actually one
of the sites run by Lars Hundley, the entrepreneur profiled in the “Paying for
search listings can pay off” sidebar, later in this chapter.) The game is to get as
many other Web sites as possible to link to this URL. The terms that a visitor
clicks to get to this URL can be anything: Yo-Yos, Play Yo-Yos, and so on. The
more links you can make, the better your search results will be.
Leaving a Trail of Crumbs
In order to improve your site’s search placement, you need to make it easy for
searchers to find you. You leave a trail of digital crumbs. You add keywords to
the HTML for your Web pages, and you make sure that your site is included
in the databases of the most popular services. 
Keep in mind that most Web surfers don’t enter single words in search boxes.
They tend to enter phrases. Combinations of keywords are extra effective.
If you sell tools, don’t just enter tools as a keyword. Enter keywords such as
tool box, power tool, tool caddy, pneumatic tool, electric tool, and so on. 
Adding keywords to your HTML
What keywords should you add to your site? Take an old-fashioned pencil
and paper and write down all the words you can think of that are related to
your site, your products, your services, or you — whatever you want to pro-
mote, in other words. You may also enlist the help of a printed thesaurus or
the one supplied online at Dictionary.com (www.dictionary.com). Look up
one term associated with your goods or services, and you’re likely to find a
number of similar terms. 
Some search services, such as AltaVista and Overture, provide you with 
keyword suggestions. Go to Overture’s Keyword Selector Tool (inventory.
overture.com/d/searchinventory/suggestion), type a word or phrase
in the box labeled Get Suggestions For:, and click the arrow next to the box.
A set of suggested terms should appear in less than a minute. This utility is
intended to help potential advertisers select keywords so that they can pay
for ads that will appear when someone searches for those words. But they
can be used to suggest keywords for your <META> tags, too. 
293
Chapter 14: Search Engine Placement

After you have a set of keywords, you need to add them to the HTML for your
Web pages. Keywords and Web site descriptions are contained within HTML
commands that begin with <META>. If you type the commands by hand using
a text editor, you need to locate the commands in between the <HEAD> and
</HEAD> tags at the head of the document. They look like this: 
<META NAME=”description”> 
<META NAME=”keywords”> 
Some Web page editors make this user friendly for you: You can type your
information in specially designated boxes. Figure 14-1 shows Macromedia
Dreamweaver’s commands, which are accessed by opening the Objects
panel, clicking Keywords, and then typing the words in the Keywords
dialog box.

You can also spy on your competitors’ Web sites to see if they have added
any keywords to their Web pages by following these steps: 
1. Go to your competitor’s home page and choose View➪Source if you
are using Internet Explorer, or choose View➪Page Source if you use
Netscape Navigator.
A new window opens with the page source supplied.
2. Scroll through the code, looking for the <META> tags if they are present.
(Press Ctrl+F, enter META, and click the Find button if you can’t find
them on your own.)
If the page’s author used <META> tags to enter keywords, you’ll see them
on-screen.
3. Make note of the keywords supplied and see if any might be applied
to your own Web site.
Keywords, like Web page addresses, are frequently misspelled. Make sure
that you type several variations on keywords that might be subject to typos:
for instance, Mississippi, Misissippi, Mississipi, and so on. Don’t worry about
getting capitalization just right, however; most searchers simply enter all low-
ercase characters and don’t bother with capital letters at all. 
Besides keywords, the <META> tag is also important for the Description com-
mand, which enables you to create a description of your Web site or Web page
that search engines can index and use in search results. Some search services
also scan the description for keywords, too, so make sure that you create a
description at the same time you type your keywords in the <META> tags. 
Registering your site with Google
Google has a program that automatically indexes Web pages all over the
Internet. The program actually has a name: Googlebot. However, you don’t
have to wait for Googlebot to find your site: You can fill out a simple form
that adds your URL to the sites that are indexed by this program. Go to
www.google.com/addurl.html, enter your URL and a few comments about
your site, and click the Add URL button. That’s all there is to it. Expect to
wait a few weeks for your site to appear among Google’s search results if it
doesn’t appear there already.

Chapter 14: Search Engine Placement

Getting listed in the Yahoo! index
If you want to get the most bang for your advertising buck, get your site listed
on the most popular locations in cyberspace. For several years now, the many
sites owned by Yahoo! have been ranked in the top three most popular sites
on the Internet in the Media Metrix Top 50 list of Web Properties published
by comScore Media Metrix (www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?
press=372). Although many people think of Yahoo! primarily as a search
engine, it’s also a categorical index to Web sites. Getting listed on Yahoo!
means being included on one of its index pages. An index page is a list of Web
sites grouped together by category, much like what you’d find in a traditional
yellow-pages phone book.
Aside from its steadily increasing size and popularity, one thing that sets
Yahoo! apart is the way in which it evaluates sites for inclusion on its index
pages. For the most part, real human beings do the Yahoo! indexing; they
read your site description and your own suggested location and then deter-
mine what category to list your site under. Usually, Yahoo! lists sites in only
one or two categories, but if Yahoo! editors feel that a site deserves its own
special category, they create one for it.
The Yahoo! editors don’t even attempt to process all the thousands of site
applications they receive each week. Reports continue to circulate on the
Web as to how long it takes to get listed on Yahoo! and how difficult it is to
get listed at all. The process can take weeks, months, or even years. Danny
Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Watch, estimates that only about a quar-
ter of all sites that apply get listed. That’s why Yahoo! has now instituted an
Express listing system — your business site will get reviewed in exchange
for a $299, nonrefundable annual fee, though you still aren’t guaranteed
that you’ll get listed. Find out more at help.yahoo.com/help/us/bizex/
index.html.

Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 
Spying on the Web searchers
If you have ever wondered what people search
for every day on the Internet, you’re in luck.
A site called Metaspy (www.metaspy.com)
lets visitors look “behind the scenes” at a list of
keywords that visitors to its search service,
MetaCrawler, are entering in near-real time.
(The list of search services is refreshed every
15 seconds.) It doesn’t help you make your e-
commerce site more visible, but it does tell you
how diverse the topics are that are searched on
Web sites. If nothing else, it makes you aware
that some of your keywords need to be general
and universal as well as topic specific. 

Search Engine Watch (searchenginewatch.com) is a great place to go for
tips on how search engines and indexes work, and how to get listed on them.
The site includes an article about one company’s problems getting what it
considers to be adequate Yahoo! coverage (searchenginewatch.com/
sereport/9801-miningco.html).
What can you do to get listed on Yahoo!? I have a three-step suggestion:
1. Make your site interesting, quirky, or somehow attention grabbing.
You never know; you may just stand out from the sea of new Web sites
and gain the attention of one of the Yahoo! editors.
2. Go ahead and try applying to the main Yahoo! index.
You can at least say you tried!
a. Go to www.yahoo.com, find the category page that you think
should list your site, and click the Suggest a Site link at the very
bottom of the page.
The Yahoo! Suggest a Site page appears.
b. Click the Standard Consideration button.
c. Verify that the Yahoo! category shown is the one in which you
want to be included, and then click Continue.
d. On the form that appears, provide your URL and a description
for your site.
Make your description as interesting as possible while remaining
within the content limit. (If you submit a description that’s too long,
Yahoo! asks you to revise it.)
3. Try a local Yahoo! index.
Major metropolitan areas around the country, as well as in other parts
of the world, have their own Yahoo! indexes. Go to local.yahoo.com
and click the Browse By City link. Find the local index closest to you and
apply as I describe in the preceding step. Your chances are much better
of getting listed locally than on the main Yahoo! site.
You can improve your listing on Yahoo! by shelling out anywhere from $25 to
$300 or more per year to become a sponsored Web site. Your site is listed in
the Sponsored Sites box at the top of a Yahoo! category. The exact cost depends
on the popularity of the category. There is life beyond Yahoo!, too. Several
Web-based services are trying to compete by providing their own way of
organizing and evaluating Web sites. Try submitting a listing to Best of the Web
(http://botw.org) or contact one of the guides employed by About.com
(www.about.com).
297
Chapter 14: Search Engine Placement

Getting listed with other search services
Search services can steer lots of business to a commercial Web site, based on
how often the site appears in the list of Web pages that the user sees and how
high the site appears in the list. Your goal is to maximize your site’s chances
of being found by the search service.
Not so long ago, search services allowed you to list your site for free, and you
could be reasonably certain of getting your site included. Not so any more.
Most sites guarantee that you’ll be listed in their index only if you pay a sub-
scription fee. The fee and the terms vary from service to service. I did a quick
survey of the major search sites to see what the current status is. Check out
Table 14-2 to see what I discovered.

individuals to submit their sites for consideration. Here’s a quick example
that shows how to submit your site (for consideration) to one of the search
engines that still gives you the do-it-yourself option:
1. Connect to the Internet, start your Web browser, and go to AltaVista
at www.altavista.com.
The AltaVista home page appears.
2. Click the Submit a Site link.
The AltaVista Submit a Site page appears.
3. Click the Click Here link (under the heading Basic Submit).
298
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

The Yahoo! Search Sign In page appears. Confused? Remember those
interconnections between search services in Table 14-1: AltaVista gets
its search results from Yahoo!. Therefore, you have to register Yahoo! in
order to have people find you on AltaVista. 
4. Enter your Yahoo! ID and password. (If you don’t have them yet, click
the Sign Up Now link on the same page to obtain them.) Then click
Sign In.
The Yahoo! Submit Your Site page appears. 
5. In the box labeled Enter the URL, type the URL for your site’s home
page, and then click the Submit URL button.
Your page is added to the list of pages that Yahoo!’s “crawler” program
indexes. As the note on the Submit Your Site page says, you can expect
the process to take several weeks. 
Businesses on the Web can get obsessed with how high their sites appear on
the list of search results pages. If a Web surfer enters the exact name of a site
in the Excite search text box, for example, some people just can’t understand
why that site doesn’t come back at the top — or even on the first page — of
the list of returned sites. Of the millions of sites listed in a search service’s
database, the chances are good that at least one has the same name as yours
(or something close to it) or that a page contains a combination of the same
words that make up your organization’s name. Don’t be overly concerned with
hitting the top of the search-hit charts. Concentrate on creating a top-notch
Web site and making sales.
Adding keywords to key pages
Earlier in this chapter, I show you how to add keywords to the HTML for your
Web pages. Those keywords aren’t ones that visitors normally see, unless they
view the source code for your Web page. Other keywords can be added to parts
of your Web page that are visible — parts of the page that those programs
called crawlers or spiders scan and index: 
 The title: Be sure to create a title for your page. The title appears in the
title bar at the very top of the browser window. Many search engines
index the contents of the title because it appears not only at the top of
the browser window, but at the top of the HTML, too. 
 Headings: Your Web page’s headings should be specific about what you
sell and what you do. 
 The first line of text: Sometimes, search services index every word on
every page, but others limit the amount of text they index. So the first
lines might be indexed while others are not. Get your message across
quickly; pack your first sentences with nouns that list what you have
for sale.

Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 
Paying for search listings can pay off
As you can see in Table 14-1, listing with search
sites is growing more complex all the time.
Many sites are owned by other sites. Two search
services, Yahoo! and MSN Search, are part of
the Overture search network. You tell Overture
how much you’ll pay if someone clicks your list-
ing when it appears in a list of search results.
The higher you bid, the better your ranking in the
results. In exchange for the fees you pay to
Overture, your search listings appear in multi-
ple search sites.
Overture (formerly called GoTo.com) has lots of
options for paid listings. You can create your
own listing and then pay $20 per month. You can
also pay a $99 fee to have Overture write up to
20 listings for you; a $199 option is also available
for which Overture will write up to 100 listings
for you. In each case, you need to spend a min-
imum of $20 per month to be listed. You bid a
minimum of five cents per click on how much
you want to pay for clickthroughs — each time
someone clicks your listing and goes to your
site, you pay Overture. You can tell Overture that
you want to have a Premium Listing at the top of
the search results, but remember that the more
clickthroughs you get, the higher fees you pay.
Find out more at www.overture.com.
Lars Hundley, who in 1998 started his first online
store, Clean Air Gardening (shown in the fol-
lowing figure), has received lots of publicity
thanks to energetic marketing and good use of
search engine resources, including the Overture
search network. He hosts Clean Air Gardening
and other e-commerce sites with Yahoo! Small
Business, a storefront solution described in
Chapter 9. Other informational sites are hosted
on his own Web server. 

The best way to ensure that your site gets indexed is to pack it with useful
content. I’m talking about textual content: Search programs can’t view photos,
animations, or sounds. Make sure that your pages contain a significant amount
of text as well as these other types of content. 
Web sites that specialize in search engine optimization talk about something
called keyword density: the number of keywords on your page, multiplied by
the number of times each one is used. Keyword density is seen as a way to
gain a good search engine ranking. In other words, if you sell shoes and you
use ten different terms once, you won’t get as good of a ranking compared to
the use of six of seven words that appear twice, or a handful of well-chosen
keywords used several times each. 
Don’t make your pages hard to index
Sometimes, the key to making things work is simply being certain that
you aren’t putting roadblocks in the way of success. The way you format
Web pages can prevent search services from recording your text and 
the keywords you want your customers to enter. Avoid these obvious 
hindrances: 
 Your text begins too far down the page. If you load the top of your page
with images that can’t be indexed, your text will be indexed that much
slower, and your rankings will suffer. 
 Your pages are loaded with Java applets, animations, and other
objects that can’t be indexed. Content that slows down the automatic
indexing programs will reduce your rankings, too. 
 Your pages don’t actually include the ideal keyword phrase you want
your searchers to use. If you have a business converting LP records to
CDs, you want the phrase “LP to CD” or “convert LPs to CDs” somewhere
on your home page and on other pages as well. 
301
Chapter 14: Search Engine Placement
Hundley uses many of the search engine place-
ment tools mentioned in this chapter, such as
Google’s AdWords and Overture. “I also use
things like Wordtracker and the Overture search
term suggestion tool to make sure that I use
important keywords in all my product descrip-
tions. I always try to name and describe things
in the words that people are searching for, and
I think that really pays off over time.”
Not only that, but he uses his previous journal-
ism experience to write and distribute his own
press releases and pitch articles to magazines
such as U.S. News and World Report, the Wall
Street Journal, This Old House, and others. It’s
hard to argue with success: Hundley reports
that Clean Air Gardening brought in gross rev-
enues of more than $800,000 in 2004. 

Every image on your Web page can potentially be assigned a textual label
(also known as ALT text because the ALT element in HTML enables it to be
used). The immediate purpose of the label is to tell visitors what the image
depicts in case it cannot be displayed in the browser window. As a trick to
produce more keyword density, you can assign keywords or keyword phrases
to these names instead.
Maximizing links
Along with keywords, hyperlinks are what search engines use to index a site
and include it in a database. By controlling two types of links, you can pro-
vide search services with that much more information about the contents of
your site:
 The hyperlinks contained in the bodies of your Web pages
 The links that point to your site from other locations around the Web
The section, “Links help searchers connect to you,” earlier in this chapter,
mentions the links in the bodies of your own Web pages. One of the most
effective tricks for increasing the number of links that point to your online
store is to create several different Web sites, each of which points to that
store. That’s just what Lars Hundley did with his main e-commerce site,
Clean Air Gardening (www.cleanairgardening.com).
“Creating my own network of gardening sites that provide quality information
helps me rise to the top of the search engines in many categories,” says Lars.
“People find the content sites sometimes and click through to Clean Air
Gardening to buy related products.”
It’s true: Do an Advanced Search on Google for sites that link to www.
cleanairgardening.com, and you’ll find links in the following locations.
First, the ones that are run by Lars: 
 Organic Pest Control (www.organicgardenpests.com)
 Guide to Using a Reel Mower (www.reelmowerguide.com)
 Organic Garden Tips (www.organicgardentips.com)
 CompostGuide.com (www.compostguide.com)
 Rain Barrel Guide (www.rainbarrelguide.com)
Next, just a sampling of the many sites that link to Clean Air Gardening that
aren’t run by Lars: 
302
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

 National Gardening Association (garden.garden.org)
 GardenToolGuide.com (www.gardentoolguide.com)
 Master Composter (www.mastercomposter.com)
 Organic Gardening (www.organicgardening.com)
For the sites that Lars doesn’t run himself, he solicits links. “I also exchange
links with other high-ranking related sites, both in order to improve my rank-
ings, and to provide quality links for my visitors. If you stick with quality links,
you can never go wrong.” For more about Lars and how he uses the Overture
search network to help users find him on the Web, see the “Paying for search
listings can pay off” sidebar, earlier in this chapter.
A program called Search Engine Optimizer (www.searchengineoptimizer.
com) by Planet Ocean evaluates the contents of your Web pages for mistakes
that can keep your site from appearing high in a list of search results. You
can download and try the software for 30 days; if you decide to keep it, you
pay $149.
Monitoring Traffic: The Science 
of Webanalytics
How do you improve the number of times your site is found by search engines?
One way is to analyze the traffic that comes to your site, a practice often called
Webanalytics. When it comes to search engine placement, the type of research
you need to perform is called log file analysis, which can tell you exactly what
keywords already have been used to find your site. You can then combine
those words into new keyword phrases, hopefully helping even more people
find your site. You can get software that will do the analysis for you, or you
can do it yourself. I briefly describe each way in this section.
Software options
Some software options are specifically designed to help improve search engine
optimization. OptiLink (www.optilinksoftware.com/download.html) counts
the number of keywords on a Web page. It analyzes the links that point at the
page, and helps you analyze what the best keywords are, where they need to
be located, and what specific text will make the links rank higher in Google’s
search results. 
303
Chapter 14: Search Engine Placement

Do-it-yourself options
The other, more labor-intensive way to analyze what drives visitors to your
Web site is through analysis of log files. A log file is an electronic document
that a Web server compiles as a record of every visit made to a Web page,
image, or other object on a site. Most Web hosting services let you look at
the log file for your Web site. The log file gives you a rough idea of where
your visitors are from and which resources on your Web site are the most 
visited. By focusing on particular types of log file data, you can evaluate how
visitors find your site and which search services are doing the best job of
directing visitors to you. 
If you look at log file information in its raw text form, you’re probably mystified
by page after page of numbers and techie gibberish. Log files typically record
information such as the IP address and the domain name of the computer that
accesses a Web page. They don’t tell you the name and address of the person
using the machine at the time. They give you an idea of where the computer
is located geographically, based on the suffix at the end of a domain name
(such as .de for Germany or .fr for France). You’ll probably need to make
use of a log file analyzer such as IndexTools.com (www.indextools.com) or
WebTrends (www.webtrends.com), which present the data in a format that is
easy to interpret. 
When you’re viewing log files, one important thing to track is referrer reporting,
which gives you the site the visitor was viewing just before coming to yours.
This tells you what sites are directing visitors to yours. Make note of the search
engines that appear most frequently; these are the ones you need to work on
when it comes to improving your placement in sets of search results.

E
ver heard of a low-budget movie that came out in 1999 called The Blair
Witch Project? The cost to create this horror film was less than $100,000,
and yet the movie made more than $120 million at the box office. Most of the
movie’s popularity was generated by word of mouth, but initially, the low-
budget project got a high-tech boost thanks to some clever marketing on the
Web. The film’s promoters knew they would be able to use the Web to reach
their target audience of young people who spend a lot of time online. A Web
site featured “discovered footage” and chat rooms that enabled people to talk
about the movie. The result was a Net buzz that helped draw viewers to the
box office.
Even if your own “project” is less dramatic than a motion picture, the Web
can be a cost-effective way for a small business owner such as yourself to
get a potential customer’s attention. In fact, the most successful advertising
strategies often involve one individual connecting with another. Targeted,
personalized public relations efforts work online because cyberspace is a
personal place where intimate communication is possible. Blanketed adver-
tising strategies of the sort you see in other media (most notably, display ads,
commercials, or billboards) are expensive and don’t always work for online
businesses. Why? E-commerce is a very personal, one-to-one communications
medium. Successful e-commerce sites, such as eBay, thrive not just because
you can find bargains there but also because it promotes community through
features such as its newsletters and message boards.

Internet advertising is becoming big business, but entrepreneurs like you can
benefit from it as well. In this chapter, I describe cost-effective, do-it-yourself
advertising techniques for the online entrepreneur who has a fledgling busi-
ness on a tight budget. Usually, the more effort you put into attracting attention
to your business, the more visits you receive. So remember that if you don’t
toot your own horn, there’s a danger that it may not get tooted at all.
Coming Up with a Marketing Strategy
In case you haven’t figured it out by now, half the battle with running a success-
ful online business is developing a plan for what you want to do. The next step
is to get noticed. The following sections describe two strategies for making
your company name more visible to online customers.
A brand that speaks for you
In business-speak, branding has nothing to do with cattle roundups and
everything to do with jacking up your profits. Branding is the process of raising
awareness of a company’s name and logo through advertising, public relations,
or other means.
Despite the recent economic slowdowns, the Web is still a great place for
developing a business brand. A November 2004 study by the Interactive
Advertising Bureau (www.iab.net) reported that in the third quarter of that
year online, advertising revenue (the amount businesses spend to advertise
online) rose for the eighth consecutive quarter. Internet advertising revenues
for the first nine months of 2004 ($7 billion) was reported to be almost as
much as that for all of 2003 ($7.3 billion).
For one thing, you don’t have to get your shopper to dress up, drive across
town, and find a parking spot. Web users sit only a foot or two from the screen
(or only inches away, if they’re using a handheld device), which means that
your Web page can easily get a user’s undivided attention — if your content
is compelling enough, that is. Don’t be shy about providing links to click,
thumbnail images to view, and the like. Previous studies have found that Web
advertising that doesn’t seem like advertising — that is interactive and enter-
taining — is supported and liked by consumers, and that brands advertised
on the Web were seen as being forward thinking.
But don’t rely on your Web page alone to spread your name. Make use of the
whole Internet, including e-mail, online communities, contests, and promo-
tions. These days, you’ve got plenty of options, such as the following, to get
the word out about your online business:
306
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

 Banner ads: This type of ad is similar to the traditional print ads that
you can place in a newspaper. See the “Waving a banner ad” section,
later in this chapter, for more information.
 Classifieds: You can advertise your goods on a classified ad site such as
AOL ClassifiedPlus (ClassifiedPlus.aol.com).
 Interstitials: These are popup ads that appear in a separate window
while a Web page is loading.
 Keyword searches: You can pay search services to make your site
appear more prominently in search results. See the “Paid search and
keyword analysis” section, later in this chapter, for more information.
 Newsletters: You can generate goodwill and drive business to your Web
site by distributing an e-mail newsletter.
 Partnerships: Find businesses whose goods and services complement
yours and create links on each other’s Web sites. See the “Partners make
the profits go around” section, later in this chapter, for further discussion
of this tactic.
Remember that on the Net, your goal is to promote your brand in many dif-
ferent ways. For example, in early 2002, a Web site was launched to advertise
Poland Spring bottled water. The site not only talks about the history of the
water itself, but it functions as an interactive portal to the state of Maine,
where the water comes from. Visitors can sign up to receive Maine escape
postcards and forward them to friends. Poland Spring thus takes advantage
of viral marketing — word-of-mouth advertising that works well online. Many
of the most popular Web logs (blogs) do the same thing: They provide links
to one another’s content, which helps drive up visits. 
A Web site can also promote a brand that has already become well known
through traditional sales and marketing strategies. The click-and-mortar 
version of the Gap (Gap.com, www.gap.com) works in conjunction with the
clothing retailer’s brick-and-mortar stores. The Web site provides a selection
of styles and sizes that’s generally greater than what customers can find in
stores. The National Retail Federation’s Stores magazine (www.stores.org)
estimates that, even though the Gap foundered financially in the fiscal year
ending on July 31, 2000, customers still purchased $13 billion worth of goods
from the Gap.com site, which was 17.5 percent up from the previous year. At
the end of 2003, Stores ranked the Gap number 2 among all specialty stores,
and reported that the Gap racked up 54 percent in profits during the year. 
You may not have thousands of dollars to spend on banner ads, but you can
start with simple things: Make sure that your signature files, your domain
name, and your e-mail address all refer to your company name as closely as
possible. It may take a long time to develop name awareness, but this is a
perfect place to start.
307
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

But remember that spellings that differ from the common English, such as
niteline.com, are difficult for people to remember, and people who only
hear the name spoken won’t know how to type it in or search for it properly.
You should also avoid hyphens, such as in WBX-TV-Bozo@somestation.com,
because, again, their placement isn’t obvious.
If the perfect domain name for your business is already taken, consider
adding a short, easy-to-remember prefix or suffix to your existing company
name. For example, if your company name is something common, such as
Housing Services, try fairly recognizable names such as housing.com and
housingservices.com. That way, the Web address is still easy to recall and
associate with your business. Or create a “cyber” name that’s related to your
real name; the Art Institute of Chicago can’t use www.artinstitute.edu
because it’s already taken by a group of Art Institutes to which it belongs. So
the Art Institute of Chicago created the short abbreviation www.artic.edu
that I, for one, find easy to remember.
Being selective about your audience
Traditional broadcast advertising, such as commercials or radio spots, are like
standing on top of a tall building and screaming, “Hey everyone, come to my
store.” They deliver short bits of information to huge numbers of people —
everyone in their coverage areas who happens to be tuned in at a particular
time. The Internet has its own form of broadcasting — getting your company
mentioned or advertised on one of the sites that draws millions of visitors
each day.
But where the Internet really excels is in one-to-one communication of the kind
that TV and radio can’t touch. I suggest that you try your own personalized
forms of online advertising before you attempt to blanket cyberspace with
banner ads. Often, you can reach small, targeted groups of people — or even
one prospect at a time — through free, do-it-yourself marketing strategies.
Publicity Strategies That Are Free
In the following sections, I describe some ways that you can publicize your
online business yourself for free. Prepare, however, to devote several hours
a week to corresponding by e-mail and applying to have your business listed
in search services, Internet indexes, or Web sites that have a customer base
similar to yours.
308
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

The best way to generate first-time and return visits to your business site is
to make yourself useful as well as ornamental. The longer people are inclined
to stay on your Web site, the more likely they are to acquire your goods or
services. See Chapter 6 for some specific suggestions on generating compelling,
useful content.
Keywords are the key
To maximize your Web site’s chances of being listed in response to queries to
the Internet search services, you can add special code to the underlying HTML
(HyperText Markup Language) source code for your home page.
The source code for a Web page is the set of HTML commands that actually
make the words, images, links, and other content appear correctly in a Web
browser window. Every Web page has HTML source code, and all Web
browsers let you take a peek behind the curtain of a Web page to study the
source code. To do so, Netscape Navigator users choose View➪Page Source;
Internet Explorer users choose View➪Source.
SoftBear Shareware LLC (a company that I profile in the section, “A contest
where everyone’s a winner,” later in this chapter) uses this strategy to draw
search engines to its Doctor Puck Web site. If you look at the source code for
the Doctor Puck home page, you see the following <META> tags:
<META NAME=”description” CONTENT=”Doctor Johnny Puck founder
of Ice Puck University invites you to shop the
Pucktasm store with Ingrid.”>
<META NAME=”keywords”
CONTENT=”hockey,johnny,ice,puck,university,movies,
model,models,free,software,shop”>
<META> is an HTML instruction, or tag, that contains descriptive information
about the contents of a Web page or Web site. Many search services, such as
Excite and AltaVista, use computer programs that scan a Web page’s <META>
tags in the course of indexing that page’s contents. You can include important
information in <META> tags to give your site a better chance of being indexed
more effectively. In the preceding example, the “description” portion of the
<META> tag provides a standard site synopsis for search engines to display
when they provide a link to your site. The “keywords” portion of the <META>
tag includes words that users can enter into a search engine in order to find
your site.
309
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

Most <META> tags use two attributes, NAME and CONTENT. The NAME attribute
identifies the property and the CONTENT attribute specifies the property’s
value. Attributes are terms that provide a Web browser with more specific
instructions about the command it is being given and how to act on that 
command.
Where to put the <META> tag
Every Web page is enclosed by the two tags <HTML> and </HTML>. These tags
define the page as being an HTML document. The <HTML> tag goes at the
beginning of the document and </HTML> goes at the end.
Within the <HTML> and </HTML> tags reside two main subdivisions of
a Web page:
 The header section: This section, enclosed by the tags <HEAD> and
</HEAD>, is where the <META> tags go.
 The body section: This section, enclosed by the tags <BODY> and
</BODY>, is where the contents of the Web page — the part you
actually see on-screen — go.
You don’t have to include <META> tags on every page on your site; in fact,
your home page is the only page where doing so makes sense.

Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 
Managing your mailing list
When you make the decision to host and run
your own mailing list, you assume the responsi-
bility of processing requests to subscribe and
unsubscribe from the list. This venture can start
eating into the time that you need to spend on
your other business activities. When mailing
lists get to be too much to handle yourself, you
have a couple of options to make life easier:
 Purchase special mailing-list software:
This type of program automatically adds or
subtracts individuals from a mailing list in
response to special e-mail messages that
they send to you. You can usually manage
the mailing list from your home computer. If
you’re a Windows 95 or later user, check out
Mailing List Express by Mail-List-Software.
com (www.mail-list-software.com).
Mac users can try ListSTAR by MCF Software
(www.liststar.com).
 Hire a company to run your mailing list for
you: Even though mailing-list software can
help reduce the work involved in maintaining
a list, you still have to install and use the soft-
ware on a regular basis. So if you’re really
strapped for time, hiring a company to take
care of your mailing list may be the way to
go. Check out SKYLIST, Inc. (www.skylist.
net) and Lyris ListHosting (www.lyris.
com/products/listhosting) for pric-
ing information.

How to create a <META> tag
The following steps show how to add your own <META> tags to a Web page by
using Microsoft FrontPage 2002. (The steps are similar for other Web page
editors.) These steps presume that you’ve already installed Internet Explorer
and FrontPage 2002, created your Web site’s home page, and saved it on your
computer with a name like index.htm or index.html. To add <META> tags to
your site’s home page, start FrontPage and follow these steps:
1. Open the Web page document to which you want to add <META> tags
by choosing File➪Open. (Alternatively, if you already have your Web
site open, double-click the page in the FrontPage Folder List.)
The Open File dialog box appears.
2. If the file resides on your computer’s hard drive, locate the Web page
file in the standard Windows navigation dialog box, and then click the
Open button.
3. If the file resides on the Web, you can edit it by entering the URL for
the page in the Location box of the Open File dialog box and then
clicking OK. (You must be connected to the Web to display the file.)
The Web page opens in the Normal pane of the FrontPage window, as
shown in Figure 15-1. To add the <META> tags, you must type them directly
into the HTML source code for the page.
Figure 15-1:

may look
complex,
but it really
streamlines
the process

Web pages.
311
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

4. Click the HTML tab near the bottom of the FrontPage window.
FrontPage displays the HTML source code for your Web page.
5. Scroll to the top of your page’s HTML source code, between the
<HEAD> and </HEAD> tags, and enter your keywords and description
by using the following format:
<META NAME=”description” content=”Your short Web site
description goes here.”>
<META NAME=”keywords” content=”keyword1, keyword2, key-
word3, and so on”>
The output appears in the View HTML window, as shown in Figure 15-2.
6. Click the Normal tab to close the View HTML window.
The View HTML window closes, and you return to the FrontPage
window. Your additions aren’t visible on the Web page because they’re
intended for search engines, not visitors to your site.
Note: If you use FrontPage 2003, you view HTML code in the Code or
Code and Design pane instead of clicking the HTML tab.
7. You can now make more changes to your page, or you can save your
Web page and then close FrontPage.
Figure 15-2:

section of

document.
312
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Enter the text for your <META> tags in exactly the format shown in the pre-
ceding steps. (FrontPage documents come with several <META> tags already
inserted; you can just follow the same format for your own tags.) Be sure to
insert a single blank space between the words META and NAME and between
“description” and CONTENT. Separate each keyword with a comma and a
blank space. Also be sure to use straight double quotation marks (double-
primes) both before and after the words “keywords” and “description”.
Finally, don’t forget to enter the greater-than symbol (>) after each command.
If you don’t, the text will end up in the body of your Web page where every-
one can see it.
A newsletter for next to nothing
It used to be said that the pen is mightier that the sword, but these days
nothing beats a well-used mouse. No longer do you have to spend time and
money to print a newsletter on actual paper and distribute it around the
neighborhood. Now that you’re online, you can say what you want as often
as you want with your own publication. Online newsletters also help meet
your clients’ customer service needs, as I discuss in Chapter 13.
Publish or perish
The work of producing an online newsletter is offset by the benefits you get
in return. You may obtain hundreds or even thousands of subscribers who
find out about you and your online business. 
In order for your publishing venture to run smoothly, however, you have
some areas to consider:
 Topics: If you run out of your own topics to write about, look to others
for inspiration. Identify magazines in your field of business so that you
can quote articles. Get on the mailing list for any press releases that
you can use.
 Staff: You don’t have to do it all. Delegate the editing function to some-
one else, or line up colleagues to function as contributors.
 Design: You have two choices: You can send a plain-text version that
doesn’t look pretty but that everyone can read easily, or you can send a
formatted HTML version that looks like a Web page but that only people
who can receive formatted e-mail can read. Keep in mind, though, that
many users are on corporate e-mail systems that either discourage or
prohibit HTML-formatted e-mail. Others don’t like HTML e-mail because
it takes longer to download the graphics files.
 Audience: Identify your readers and make sure that your content is
useful to them.
313
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

Newsletters work only if they appear on a regular basis and if they consistently
maintain a high level of quality. Whether yours comes out every week, every
month, or just once a year, your subscribers will expect you to re-create your
publication with every new issue. Keep your newsletter simple and make sure
that you have the resources to follow through.
Extra! Read all about it!
After you do your planning, the actual steps involved in creating your newslet-
ter are pretty straightforward. I suggest that, because you’re just starting out,
you concentrate on producing only a plain-text version of your newsletter.
Later on, you can think about doing an HTML version as well.
People are satisfied with receiving inside tips and suggestions and are happy
that they don’t have to wait for graphics files to download. The small Chicago
publishing house that published my book Literary Chicago uses a typical plain-
text arrangement for its newsletter, which is shown in Figure 15-3.
Before you do anything, check with your ISP to make sure that you’re 
permitted to have a mailing-list publication. Even if your newsletter is a
simple announcement that you send out only once in a while (in contrast to 
a discussion list, which operates pretty much constantly), you’re going to
be sending a lot more e-mail messages through your ISP’s machines than
you otherwise would.

314
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Keep your newsletters small in size; about 30K is the biggest e-mail file you
can comfortably send to your recipients. If you absolutely must have a larger
newsletter, break it into two or three separate e-mail messages. Reducing the
file size of your newsletter keeps your readers from getting irritated because
your message takes so long to download or to open. And keeping your cus-
tomers happy should be one of your highest business priorities.
When you’re all set with the prep work, follow these general steps for an
overview of how to create and distribute your publication:
1. Open a plain-text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or
SimpleText (Mac).
2. Start typing.
Just because your newsletter is in plain text doesn’t mean that you can’t
spice it up. Consider the following low-tech suggestions for emphasizing
text or separating one section from another:
• All caps: Using ALL CAPITAL LETTERS is always useful for distin-
guishing the name of the newsletter or heads from subheads.
• Rules: You can create your own homemade horizontal rules by
typing a row of equal signs, hyphens, or asterisks to separate 
sections.
• Blank spaces: Used carefully, that lowly spacebar on your key-
board can help you center plain text or divide it into columns.
Be sure to proofread the whole newsletter before sending it out. Better
yet, enlist the help of an objective viewer to read over the text for you.
Ask him or her to make suggestions on content, organization, and format,
as well as to look for typos.
3. Save your file.
4. Open your e-mail program’s address book, select the mailing list of
recipients, and compose a new message to them.
5. Attach your newsletter to the message, or paste it into the body of the
message, and send it away.
If you’re sending many e-mail messages simultaneously, be sure to do your
mailing at a time when Internet traffic isn’t heavy. Many popular newsletters,
such as eWeek News and HotWired, go out on weekends, for example.
Don’t flood your Internet service provider’s mail server with hundreds or
thousands of messages at one time; you may crash the server. Break the list
into smaller batches and send them at different times. That’s what Debbie
Redpath Ohi did with her newsletter, Inklings, which attracted more than
46,000 subscribers before she decided to sell it. Inklings is no more, but you
can still be inspired by the story of Inklings at www.globetechnology.com/
woman/archive/20010322.html.
315
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

Be sure to mention your newsletter on your Web page and to provide an
e-mail address where people can subscribe to it. In the beginning, you can
ask people to send subscription requests to you. If your list swells to hun-
dreds of members, consider automated mailing-list software or a mailing-list
service to manage your list.
Participating in mailing 
lists and newsgroups
Many areas of the Internet can provide you with direct access to potential
customers as well as a chance to interact with them. Two of the best places
to market yourself directly to individuals are mailing lists and newsgroups.
Mailing lists and newsgroups are highly targeted and offer unprecedented
opportunities for niche marketing. Using them takes a little creativity and
time on your part, but the returns can be significant.
Get started by developing a profile of your potential customer. Then join and
participate in lists and newsgroups that may provide customers for your online
business. For example, if you sell memorabilia of movie stars to fans online,
you may want to join some newsgroups started by the fans themselves.
Where can you find these discussion forums? Topica (www.topica.com)
maintains a mailing-list directory that you can search by name or topic and
that includes thousands of mailing lists. (Topica also helps you create your own
e-mail newsletter, by the way.) Refdesk.com (www.refdesk.com) maintains
links to Web sites, organized by category, that help you locate and participate
in lots of newsgroups, mailing lists, and Web forums.
Mailing lists
A mailing list is a group of individuals who receive communications by e-mail.
Two kinds of mailing lists are common online:
 Discussion lists: These are lists of people interested in a particular topic.
People subscribe to the list and have messages on the topic delivered by
e-mail. Each message sent to the list goes to everyone in the group. Each
person can reply either to the original sender or to everyone in the group,
too. The resulting series of messages on a topic is called a thread.
 Announcement lists: These lists provide only one-way communication.
Recipients get a single message from the list administrator, such as an
attached e-mail newsletter of the sort that I describe earlier in this chapter.
Discussion lists are often more specific in topic than newsgroups. These lists
vary from very small lists to lists that include thousands of people. An exam-
ple of a discussion list is ROOTS-L, which is a mailing list for individuals who
316
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

are researching family history. People on this list exchange inquiries about
ancestors that they’re seeking and announce family tree information they’ve
posted online.
By making contributions to a mailing list, you establish a presence, so when
members are looking to purchase the kind of goods or services you offer,
they’re likely to come to you rather than to a stranger. By participating in the
lists that are right for you, you also find out invaluable information about your
customers’ needs and desires. Use this information to fine-tune your business
so that it better meets those needs and desires.
Marketing through lists and newsgroups requires a low-key approach. Par-
ticipating by answering questions or contributing your opinion to ongoing
discussion topics is far more effective than blatant self-promotion.
Always read the welcome message and list guidelines that you receive upon
joining a mailing list. Figure out the rules before you post. Lurk in the back-
ground for a few weeks to get a feel for the topics and participants before you
contribute. Let your four- to six-line signature file establish your identity with-
out selling your wares directly. Also, don’t forget to spell check and proofread
your messages before you send them.
317
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity
Profiting from someone else’s banner ads
Banner ads may be out of favor, but they’re not
dead by any means. When used economically and
targeted to the right audience, banner ads can
help you achieve one of your goals: attracting
visitors to your Web site. Attract enough visitors,
and banner ads can help you achieve another,
even more important goal: making money.
If you attract thousands or (if you’re lucky) even
millions of visitors to your site each month, you
become an attractive commodity to advertisers
looking to gain eyespace for their own banner
advertisements. By having another business pay
you to display their ads, you can generate extra
revenue with very little effort.
Of course, the effort involved in soliciting adver-
tisers, placing ads, keeping track of how many
visitors to your site click ads, and getting paid is
considerable — but you don’t have to manage
ads yourself.
For John Moen, owner of a pair of map-related
Web sites (including Graphic Maps, which I pro-
file in Chapter 1), the move from marketing his own
Web site to becoming an advertiser came when
his worldatlas.com (www.worldatlas.com)
site began to attract 3 million hits per month. He
turned to advertising giant DoubleClick (www.
doubleclick.com) to serve the ads and
handle the maintenance.
“We place their (DoubleClick’s) banner code on
our pages, and they pay us monthly for page
impressions, direct clicks, page hits, and the
like,” says John. “They (DoubleClick) also provide
a daily report on site traffic. With their reports, I
can tell which page gets the most hits and at
what time of day. Banner advertising now pays
very well.”

Newsgroups
Newsgroups, which are often simply called discussion groups, provide a differ-
ent form of online group discussion. On the Internet, you can find discussion
groups in an extensive network called Usenet. America Online and CompuServe
also have their own systems of discussion groups that are separate from
Usenet. One of the easiest ways to access newsgroups, however, is with your
Web browser. Just point it to Google Groups (groups.google.com). Many
large corporations and other organizations maintain their own internal dis-
cussion groups as well. In any case, you access discussion groups with your
Web browser’s newsgroup software. The program that comes bundled with
Netscape Communicator is called Netscape Collabra; Microsoft Outlook Express
has its own newsgroup software, too.
You can promote yourself and your business in discussion groups the same
way that you can make use of mailing lists: by participating in the group, pro-
viding helpful advice and comments, and answering questions. Don’t forget
that newsgroups are great for fun and recreation, too; they’re a good way to
solve problems, get support, and make new friends. For more information on
newsgroups, see Chapter 2.
The power of an address book
If you already keep important contact information in a daily planner or other
book, setting up an electronic address book on the Internet will be easy. Any
good e-mail program has an address book where you can quickly record the
e-mail addresses of people with whom you correspond. Every time someone
sends you an inquiry, save that person’s address in your online address book.
Before you know it, you’ll have a mailing list of customers who have contacted
you. Programs such as Microsoft Outlook Express, Netscape Messenger, and
Eudora all let you collect a bunch of e-mail addresses into a single mailing list.
You can then send an announcement or a newsletter to everyone on your list
at one time.
After you go through the effort of assembling a mailing list, you need to remem-
ber to back it up on a regular basis. Losing a list that contains hundreds or
possibly thousands of names can be a significant setback in business terms.
Linking for fun and profit
Hypertext links to your respective Web sites are personal recommendations
that can carry more weight than a banner advertisement. Simply call or e-mail
the owner of another Web site and ask to exchange links with that person.
318
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

Approaching your fiercest competitors to exchange links is probably not a
good business practice. Rather, try to find a complementary business or group
or organization that covers every business in your field.
Partners make the profits go around 
The idea here is to team up with another online company whose products or
services complement your own. The Big Guys do this all the time: Microsoft
signs an agreement with NBC; Yahoo! joins Viacom; Viacom joins CBS.
On a smaller scale, the Gustobene site, where lovers of Italian food can go to
purchase gourmet specialty items, includes a full page of links to partner Web
sites that bring Italians together, such as Italmatch, a site for Italian singles
(see Figure 15-4). Conversely, if you visit Italmatch (www.italmatch.com/
home.htm), you see a referral to Gustobene on its home page.

319
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

Often, you find that two businesses that have this type of symbiotic relation-
ship are more than partners; they may be branches of the same company, or
perhaps the same people created both sites. But the principle is the same:
Two related businesses help one another by promoting each other’s Web sites.
Trapezo (www.brightwire.com/trapezo) is in the business of setting up
partnerships between related companies on the Internet. Trapezo arranges
partnerships between online businesses and displays one company’s content
on another’s Web site through a Display Case (a small, banner ad-type area
placed in each partner’s Web site).
A contest where everyone’s a winner
In Chapter 1, I describe how cartographer John Moen uses contests and other
promotions to attract attention to his online business. Remember that every-
one loves to receive something for free. Holding a contest can attract visitors
to your Web site, where they can find out about the rest of your offerings —
the ones you offer for sale, that is.
You don’t have to give away cars or trips around the world to get attention.
SoftBear Shareware LLC, a company located both on America Online and the
Web, gives away teddy bears and other simple items on its Web site (www.
799bear.com). As you can see in Figure 15-5, its Teddy Bear contest has
attracted more than 20,000 visitors over several years, and was about to be
discontinued as I was revising this chapter. When I asked SoftBear’s owner,
John Raddatz, whether contests had helped gain attention for his business,
he responded as follows:
“YES, YES, YES. Contests have increased traffic to my site. The response
averages about 350 entries per month. I offer contests, free screensavers
and software, which still attracts quite a few people from all over the world.
My number one contest draw is at Ice Puck University (www.ipucku.com),
where I offer a free hockey diploma every month. My Johnny Puck Web
site (www.johnnypuck.com) has spawned a local UHF TV show here in
Muskegon, Michigan. All of this started with the Teddy Bear contest on
my software and screensaver site (www.jrsoftbear.com). You must
offer something for free to draw people in to your site. Then you can
draw their attention to your main offerings.”
Elsewhere on the SoftBear Shareware site, you can see that SoftBear is enrolled
in the Amazon.com Associates Program. This is another kind of cooperative
link partnership you can consider for your small business. SoftBear recom-
mends some Amazon.com books on its site and, in return, receives referral fees.

link at the bottom of the page.

Waving a banner ad
I’m not as big a fan of traditional banner ads as I am of the other strategies that
I discuss in this chapter, especially where small entrepreneurial businesses
are concerned. And indications are that banner ads are dwindling online in
favor of targeted ads — that is, ads that appear when specified keyword
searches are conducted on sites such as Google (www.google.com) and
AskJeeves (www.askjeeves.com). 
Banner ads are like the traditional print ads you might take out in local news-
papers. In some limited cases, banner ads are free, as long as you or a designer
can create one. Otherwise, you have to pay to place them on someone else’s
Web page, the same way you pay to take out an ad in a newspaper or magazine.
However, many commercial operations do use banner ads successfully
on the Web. Banner ads can be effective promotional tools under certain 
circumstances:
 If you pay enough money to keep them visible in cyberspace for a long
period of time
 If you pay the high rates charged by the most successful Web sites,
which can steer you the most traffic
Figure 15-5:

321
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

Banner ads differ from other Web-specific publicity tactics in one important
respect: They publicize in a one-to-many rather than a one-to-one fashion.
Banner ads broadcast the name of an organization indiscriminately, without
requiring the viewer to click a link or in some respect choose to find out
about the site.
Anteing up
You have to pay the piper in order to play the banner ad game. In general,
Web sites have two methods of charging for banner ads:
 CPM, or Cost Per Thousand: This is a way of charging for advertising
based on the number of people who visit the Web page on which your
ad appears. The more visits the Web site gets, the higher the ad rates
that site can charge.
 CTR, or Clickthrough Rate: A clickthrough occurs when someone clicks
a banner ad that links to your (the advertiser’s) Web site. (Virtually all
banner ads are linked this way.) In this case, you are billed after the ad
has run for a while and the clicks have been tallied.
Say 100,000 people visit the site on which your banner runs. If the site charges
a flat $20 CPM rate, your banner ad costs $2,000 (100 × $20). If the same site
charges a $1 per clickthrough rate, and 2 percent of the 100,000 visitors click
through to your site (the approximate average for the industry), you pay the
same: $2,000 (2,000 × $1).
Obviously, the more popular the site on which you advertise, the more your
ad costs. Back in 1999, when Yahoo! was still publishing its advertising rates
online, it charged a CPM rate of $20 to $50 for each 1,000 visits to the Yahoo!
page on which the banner ad appears. If the page on which your banner runs
received 500,000 visits, such ads could cost $10,000 to $25,000. Not all adver-
tising sites are so expensive, of course. 
CPM rates are difficult to calculate because of the number of repeat visitors 
a site typically receives. For example, a Web page designer may visit the same
site a hundred times in a day when testing scripts and creating content. If 
the site that hosts your ad charges a rate based on CPM, make sure that they
weed out such repeat visits. In general, you’re better off advertising on sites
that charge not only on a CPM basis, but on a cost-per-click basis as well —
or, better yet, only on a clickthrough basis. The combination of CPM and
CTR is harder for the hosting site to calculate but ultimately fairer for you,
the advertiser.
Positioning banner ads can be a substantial investment, so be sure that your
ad appears on a page whose visitors are likely to be interested in your com-
pany. If your company sells automotive parts, for example, get on one of the
Yahoo! automotive index pages.
322
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

An article on ClickZ (www.clickz.com/news/article.php/1564281)
reports that the popular search site AskJeeves has banned banner ads in
favor of targeted, “branded response” ads that appear in response to search
queries, and text-based ads that work similarly.
Designing your ad
The standard “medium rectangle” and “large rectangle” banner ads are by far
the most popular ones. Some standard square configurations or small button-
like shapes are common, too. The numeric measurements for ads usually
appear in pixels. An inch contains roughly 72 pixels, so a 468-x-60-pixel ad
(the most common size) is about 6.5 inches wide and about 0.875 inch in height.
The rectangular ads appear most often at the top of a Web page, so they load
first while other page contents have yet to appear; smaller ads may appear
anywhere on a page. (Ensuring that your ad appears at the top of a Web page
is always a good idea.)
Many banner ads combine photographic images, type, and color in a graphi-
cally sophisticated way. However, simple ads can be effective as well. You can
create your ad yourself if you have some experience with a graphics program
such as Paint Shop Pro. (You can download a trial copy of Paint Shop Pro at
www.jasc.com.)
Need some help in creating your own banner ad? If you have only a simple, text-
only ad in mind and you don’t have a lot of money to spend on design, try a
create-your-own-banner-ad service or software program. I’ve had mixed results
with the online banner-ad services such as The Banner Generator, provided
for free by Prescient Code Solutions (www.coder.com/creations/banner).
See Figure 15-6 for an ad that I created in just a couple of minutes by using a
shareware program called Banner Maker Pro (www.bannermakerpro.com).

Guerrilla Marketing and 
Advertising Strategies
I didn’t make up the term guerilla marketing. As you may already know, the
term appears in the titles of a series of popular books by Jay Conrad Levinson
and Michael McLaughlin. It appears to be a buzzword that encompasses many
sensible marketing techniques, from providing good customer service to
knowing what your competition is doing. It also means going beyond the pas-
sive placement of ads on Web pages or other venues, and taking a proactive,
aggressive approach to getting your business name and brand out there in the
marketplace. With competition growing all the time among online businesses,
it pays to know all the options when it comes to online advertising, including
the ones that I describe in this section. 
Popup (and under, and over) ads

a window pops up on your computer, urging you to subscribe to a newsletter.
Anything you can do to induce your visitors to identify themselves and provide
contact information, from an e-mail address to a street address, is to your
advantage.
Popup ads are the bane of many Web surfers, and utilities like the Google
add-on browser toolbar and firewalls like Norton Internet Security have the
ability to block them from appearing in the first place. But they can still get
through to some individuals who don’t have software configured to block
them. And if your Web site becomes popular enough, you’ll be approached
by a company that wants to place its ad on your page, either as a banner ad
that is part of the page or a window that does one of several things: 
 Pops up: This type of ad window is probably the most common one. It
appears when a page is viewed and pops up atop the page you want to
view. These ads work best when their content is related to the page
you’ve opened: Subscribe to our newsletter, buy our book, attend our
seminar, or other supplementary information. 
 Pops under: When you open Web pages on many sites that display ads,
a new window opens. But this window, which contains an ad unrelated
to maps or clip art, opens underneath the primary window. Its content is
only visible when the user specifically tries to close it, or closes or mini-
mizes the other window(s) atop it. 
 Pops on top: These ads, also called interstitials, totally replace the con-
tent you want to view. You are forced to look at them for a period of time
and close them before you can view the page you wanted to see. I see
these ads used on the online magazine Slate (slate.msn.com). When
324
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

you click on an article, a totally new window appears, with animated
content, and it is big enough that it completely covers the article you
want to read. You need to close the ad window in order to keep reading.
You can read about interstitials at ecommerce.internet.com/
solutions/ectips/article/0,1467,6311_771181,00.html.
John Moen told me that he has received criticism for popup and other ads on
his clip art site. But the ad revenue makes it possible for him to keep creating
the art and giving it away for free. In the end, there’s a benefit for the consumer,
who gets the free art and only has to click the close box to delete the window
that pops under. 
Adding life to your ads
Ads on billboards, the sides of buildings, the sides of buses, the lights on top
of cabs, and the pages of a newspaper and magazine have one thing in common:
They basically sit there and don’t do anything. They can have lights pointed
at them, and magazine ads for perfumes can be given their own scent. 
On the Web, ads can get interactive in several different ways. The aim is to
gain more attention from the jittery, hurried Web surfer who is, after all, look-
ing for something else on the current Web page. You see several examples of
interactive ads on the Graphic Maps clip art pages I mention in the previous
section. The ad at the top of the page appears to “shiver” as it moves around,
and the ad near the bottom of the page seems to blink on and off. (Not only
that, but there’s a pop-under ad, which you can see peeking out of the corner
of the clip art page.)
It’s easier than you think to create ads that appear to move around. You need
software that’s used to create animated GIF images, such as GIF Construction
Set Professional, a Windows-only program available for $24.99 from Alchemy
Mindworks (www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/gifcon.html), or the
Macintosh application GIF.gIf.giF, available for $28 from Pedagoguery Software
(www.peda.com/ggg). When you create the initial ad image and save it in GIF
format, you create a series of variations and string them together to create
the animation. The animation software leads you through the process.
Paid search and keyword analysis
Suppose your Web business gains some revenue, and you decide to take
things a step further by placing banner ads on the Web pages of businesses
that sell products and services that complement yours. How do you know
for sure which ads are bringing you business, or at the very least, visitors?
Overture Services provides a variety of tools that can help small businesses
gain ad revenue and track which of their ads get the most exposure. 
325
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

Overture’s Market Console is intended to help its network of advertisers
track who views their ads and how many visitors click through to their Web
sites. Overture is a pioneer in the field of sponsored search.
One of the easiest ways to gain exposure for your Web site is to identify some
AdWords on Google (www.google.com), the wildly popular search engine. You
pay a small fee to have a link to your site displayed on the right side of a page
of Google search results. You identify some keywords that determine when
Google displays your ad. Find out more in Chapter 14.
Minding Your Ps and Qs(Puns and Quips)
What is it that attracts shoppers to your business and encourages them to
place orders from thousands of miles away? It’s what you have to sell and
how you present it. But how can customers understand what you’re selling if
they speak a different language? You must make your site accessible to all
your potential customers.
Speaking their language
Put yourself in your customer’s place. Suppose that you’re from Spain. You
speak a little English, but Spanish is your native tongue, and other Romance
languages, such as French or Italian, are definitely easier for you to under-
stand than English. You’re surfing around an Internet shopping mall and you
come across sentences such as
Hey, ratchet-jaws. Shoot me some e-mail with your handle, and steer clear
of Smokeys with ears.
Whatever. All you home boys will be down with my superfly jive.
Like, this cable modem is totally awesome to the max.
Get the picture? Your use of slang and local dialect may have customers from
your own hometown or region in stitches, but it can leave many more people
scratching their heads and clicking to the next site. The first rule in making
your site accessible to a worldwide audience is to keep your language simple
so that people from all walks of life can understand you.
Good manners and good business practices are both important in Japan.
You’ll find tips covering both subjects at the Gateway Japan Web site (www.
gwjapan.com).

Using the right salutations
First impressions mean a lot. The way you address someone can mean the
difference between getting off on the right foot and stumbling over your
shoelaces. The following useful tidbits are from the International Addresses
and Salutations Web page (www.bspage.com/address.html), which, in turn,
borrowed them from Merriam Webster’s Guide to International Business
Communication:
 In Austria, address a man as Herr and a woman as Frau; don’t use Fräulein
for business correspondence.
 In southern Belgium, use Monsieur or Madame to address someone, but
the language spoken in northern Belgium is Flemish, so be sure to use
De heer (Mr.) when addressing a man, or Mevrouw, abbreviated to Mevr.
(Mrs.), when addressing a woman.
 In India, use Shri (Mr.) or Shrimati (Mrs.). Don’t use a given name unless
you’re a relative or close friend.
 In Japan, given names aren’t used in business. Use the family name 
followed by the job title. Or, add -san to the family name (for example,
Fujita-san), or the even more respectful -sama (Fujita-sama).
Adding multilingual content to your Web site is a nice touch, particularly if
you deal on a regular basis with customers or clients from a particular area.
Regional differences abound, so it’s prudent to find a person familiar with the
area you are trying to target to read your text before you put it up on the
Web. Let a friend, not the absence of orders, tell you that you’ve committed a
cultural faux pas.
Making your site multilingual
One of the best ways to expand your business to other countries is to provide
alternate translations of your content. You can either hire someone to pre-
pare the text in one or more selected languages or use a computer program
to do the work for you. Then provide links to the Web pages that contain the
translated text right on your site’s home page, like this:
Read this page in:
French
Spanish
German
327
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

One translation utility that’s particularly easy to use — and, by the way, free —
is available from the search service AltaVista. Just follow these steps to get
your own instant translation:
1. Connect to the Internet, launch your Web browser, and go to
babelfish.altavista.com.
The AltaVista: World/Translate page appears.
2. If you have a specific bit of text that you want to translate, click in the
text box on this page and either type in the text or paste it from a word
processing program. If you want the service to translate an entire Web
page, enter the URL in the text box. 
Be sure to include the first part of the URL (for example, http://
www.mysite.com rather than just mysite.com).
Obviously, the shorter and simpler the text, the better your results.
3. Choose the translation path (that is, from what language you want to
translate) by clicking the Select From and To Languages drop-down list.
At this writing, the service offers translation to or from Chinese, English,
French, Korean, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and
Russian.
4. Click the Translate button.
Almost as fast as you can say “Welcome to the new Tower of Babel,” a new
Web page appears on-screen with the foreign language version of your text.
(If you selected a Web page to translate, the Web page appears in the new
language. The title of the page, however, remains in the original language.)
A computer can never be as good as a human being when it comes to lan-
guage translation. I once tried to translate my own Web page into French,
showed it to a friend who is a native speaker, and she laughed at the results.
If you try a computer translation, only attempt the simplest of sentences.
And get someone who understands the language to proofread the results.
Instead of creating a foreign-language version of your Web page, you can pro-
vide a link to the AltaVista translation page on your own page. That way, your
visitors can translate your text for themselves.
You can download the software behind the AltaVista translation service,
Systran Personal, from the Systran Software, Inc. Web site (www.systransoft.
com). The $59 program is available for Windows only and requires at least
128MB of RAM and 599MB of hard drive space. If you need translation to or
from Japanese, Chinese, or Korean (or from Russian to English), look into
Systran Professional Premium, which costs $760. This program has the same
software requirements as the Personal package, as well as an Asian font dis-
play driver for Asian language translation.
328
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

You don’t have to translate your entire Web site. In fact, just providing an
alternate version of your home page may be sufficient. The important thing is
to give visitors an overview of your business and a brief description of your
products and services in a language they can understand easily. Most impor-
tant, include a mailto: link (see Chapter 6) so that people can send mail to
you. However, if you aren’t prepared to receive a response in Kanji or Swahili,
request that your guests send their message in a language that you can read.
Although you probably don’t have sufficient resources to pay for a slew of
translation services, having someone translate your home page so that you can
provide an alternate version may be worthwhile — especially if you sell prod-
ucts that are likely to be desirable to a particular market. Plenty of translation
services are available online. Yahoo! has an index of translation services at 
dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/
Translation_Services/Web_Site_Translation
Using the right terms
Sometimes, communicating effectively with someone from another country is
a matter of knowing the terms used to describe important items in that lan-
guage. The names of the documents you use to draw up an agreement or pay
a bill are often very different in other countries than they are in your own.
For example, if you’re an American merchant and someone from Europe asks
you to provide a proforma invoice, you may not know what the person wants.
You’re used to hearing the document in question called a quote.
When you and your European buyer have come to terms, a Commercial Invoice
is an official form you may need to use for billing purposes. Many of these
forms have to do with large-scale export/import trade, and you may never
have to use them. But if you do undertake trade with people overseas, be
aware that they may require you to use their own forms, not yours, in order
to seal the deal. To avoid confusion later on, ask your overseas clients about
any special requirements that pertain to business documents before you pro-
ceed too far with the transaction.
Joining the International Trade Brigade
International trade may seem like something that only multinational corpora-
tions practice. But the so-called little guys like you and me can be international
traders, too. In fact, the term simply refers to a transaction between two or
more individuals or companies in different countries. If you’re a designer living
in the U.S. and you create some stationery artwork and Web pages for some-
one in Germany, you’re involved in international trade.

Keeping up with international trade issues
If you really want to be effective in marketing yourself overseas and become
an international player in world trade, you need to follow the tried-and-true
business strategies: networking, education, and research. Join groups that
promote international trade, become familiar with trade laws and restrictions,
and generally get a feel for the best marketing practices around the world.
Here are some suggestions for places you can start:
 The Market Access Unit page of the Irish government’s Department of
Enterprise, Trade, and Employment Web site: This page contains links
to the European Union’s Commercial Policy as well as requirements gov-
erning Export Licensing and Import Licensing. 
www.entemp.ie/trade/marketaccess
 Small Business Exporters Association: A group of small- and mid-size
business exporters devoted to networking, assistance, and advocacy.
www.sbea.org
 globalEDGE: This site is published by Michigan State University and
includes hundreds of international trade links.
globaledge.msu.edu/ibrd/ibrd.asp
The Newsletter Access Web site (www.newsletteraccess.com/subject/
intertrade.html) has information on how to subscribe to hundreds of dif-
ferent newsletters that discuss international trade issues.
Researching specific trade laws
Instead of waiting for overseas business to come to you, take a proactive
approach. First, do some research into the appropriate trade laws that apply
to countries with which you might do business. The Internet has an amazing
amount of information pertaining to trade practices for individual countries.
You can seek out international business by using one or more message boards
designed specifically for small business owners who want to participate in
international trade. These message boards let users post trade leads, which
are messages that announce international business opportunities.
For example, at the ECCommerce.com B2B trade bulletin board (www.ec
europe.com), you may find a message from a Finnish company selling sur-
plus paint, a United States company that needs office equipment, or a British
company offering X-Ray equipment for export. Advertisements on this site
typically include the URL for the business’s Web site. The site charges a fee to
post your own notices.
330
Part IV: Running and Promoting Your Online Business 

If you’re in the business of creating computer software or hardware, you need
to be aware of restrictions that the U.S. government imposes on the export of
some computer-related products. In fact, you may incur a fine of more than
$100,000 from the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. State Department
for exporting to a Denied Person, Specially Designated National, or Restricted
Country. The list of these people and countries changes frequently. Look for
links to the current ones at www.treas.gov/ofac/index.html.
The Buy & Sell Exchange site of the Federation of International Trade
Associations (www.worldbid.com) lets you post your own trade leads or
search for other leads by keyword. The Trade Leads page of the extensive
globalEDGE site (globaledge.msu.edu/ibrd/busresmain.asp?Resource
CategoryID=13), includes links to sites that post trade leads in countries
such as Egypt, India, and Taiwan.
Exploring free trade zones
A free trade zone (FTZ) is an officially designated business or industrial area
within a country where foreign and domestic goods are considered to be out-
side of the territory covered by customs. You don’t have to pay customs
duty, taxes, or tariffs on merchandise brought into, handled, or stored in an
FTZ. You can find FTZs in many countries as well as in many U.S. states.
The purpose of FTZs is to reduce customs costs and make it easier for busi-
nesses to send goods into a country. You can store your items there for a
while, exhibit them, and, if necessary, change them to comply with the import
requirements of the country in question, until the time comes when you want
to import them into the country.
Shipping Overseas Goods
It never hurts to state the obvious, so here goes: Don’t depend on ground mail
(appropriately nicknamed snail mail) to communicate with overseas customers.
Use e-mail and fax to get your message across and, if you have to ship infor-
mation or goods, use airmail express delivery. Surface mail can take weeks or
even months to reach some regions of some countries — if it gets there at all.
Your customer may ask you to provide an estimate of your export costs by
using a special set of abbreviations called incoterms. Incoterms (short for
international commercial trade terms) are a set of standardized acronyms that
were originally established in 1936 by the International Chamber of Commerce.
They establish an international language for describing business transactions
to prevent misunderstandings between buyers and sellers from different coun-
tries. Incoterms thus provide a universal vocabulary that is recognized by all
international financial institutions.
331
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity

Incoterms are most likely to apply to you if you’re shipping a large number of
items to an overseas factory rather than, for example, a single painting to an
individual’s home. But just in case you hit the big time, you should be aware
of common incoterms, such as
 EXW (Ex Works): This term means that the seller fulfills his or her oblig-
ation by making the goods available to the buyer at the seller’s own
premises (or works). The seller doesn’t have to load the goods onto the
buyer’s vehicle unless otherwise agreed.
 FOB (Free on Board): This term refers to the cost of shipping overseas
by ship — not something you’re likely to do in this high-tech day and age.
But if you sell a vintage automobile to a collector in France, who knows?
 CFR (Cost and Freight): This term refers to the costs and freight charges
necessary to transport items to a specific overseas port. CFR describes
only costs related to items that are shipped by sea and inland waterways
and that go to an actual port. Another incoterm, CPT (Carriage Paid To)
can refer to any type of transport, not just shipping, and refers to the
cost for the transport (or carriage) of the goods to their destination.
You’ll find a detailed examination of incoterms at the International Chamber
of Commerce Web site (www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp).
If the item you’re planning to ship overseas by mail is valued at more
than $2,500, the U.S. requires you to fill out and submit a Shipper’s Export
Declaration (SED) and submit it to a U.S. customs agent. The SED requires
you to provide your name, address, and either your Social Security number
or your Internal Revenue Service Employer Identification Number (EIN). You
also have to describe what’s being sent, where it’s being sent from, and its
ultimate destination. You can purchase an SED from your local U.S. customs
office or from the Government Printing Office (www.access.gpo.gov),
202-783-3238. Detailed instructions on how to fill out the SED are available on
the U.S. Census Bureau’s Web site (www.census.gov/foreign-trade/www/
correct.way.html). You can file the SED through the U.S. Customs Service’s
Web site (www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/export/aes/easy_steps.xmlAES).
Some nations require a certificate of origin or a signed statement that attests
to the origin of the exported item. You can usually obtain such certificates
through a local chamber of commerce.
Some purchasers or countries may also ask for a certificate of inspection
stating the specifications met by the goods shipped. Inspections are per-
formed by independent testing organizations.
Wherever you ship your items, be sure to insure them for the full amount
they are worth. Tell your customers about any additional insurance charges
up front. Finally, choose an insurance company that is able to respond quickly
to claims made from your own country and from your customers’ country.

Getting Paid in International Trade
Having an effective billing policy in place is especially important when your
customers live thousands of miles away. The safest strategy is to request pay-
ment in U.S. dollars and to ask for cash in advance. This approach prevents
any collection problems and gets you your money right away.
333
Chapter 15: Advertising and Publicity
Marketing through global networking
Jeffrey Edelheit knows the potential for making
connections around the world by taking advan-
tage of the networking value of the World Wide
Web. Edelheit, a business planning and develop-
ment consultant based in Sebastopol, California,
supports fledgling entrepreneurs’ dreams of get-
ting their businesses off the ground. He also helps
established businesspeople extend their reach
by looking at ways of gaining greater market
exposure — including going online. In addition,
Jeffrey works closely with management and staff
to develop the internal systems necessary to
build a strong operational base for the company.
Edelheit provides the following guidance:
 Be deliberate in the creation of your Web
site: “I’ve worked with clients who are able
to attract overseas customers and express
themselves through creating their own Web
sites,” he says. A well thought out Web site
can create a relationship between you and
your customers; in other words, the stronger
the relationship, the greater the opportunity
for sales.
 Know your market: Jeffrey goes on to say,
“The most important suggestion I can make
is to know the overseas market that you
want to reach and be aware of the issues
associated with doing business there. I rec-
ommend getting contact information for an
international trade group from the country’s
consulate.”
 Research shipping costs and regulations:
Shipping costs and restrictions are among
the most common problems new business-
people encounter when dealing with foreign
customers, he says. “Check with the U.S.
Customs Service and find out what the duty
charges are before you ship overseas. Once,
in the ’80s, a company I was working with
shipped an IBM computer to Sweden, but
because there were still restrictions on
exporting high-tech equipment, I nearly got
arrested by the U.S. Customs for not having
received the required special clearance.”
 Avoid being ethnocentric: Also be aware of
how consumers in other cultures regard
your products, he suggests. Make sure that
nothing about your products would be con-
sidered offensive or bad luck to someone
from another part of the world.
 Be visible: Edelheit emphasizes that after
you figure out the inside tricks to the search
engines and cooperative links, you have
unlimited potential to reach people. He
believes that one of the keys to a successful
Web site is providing information that your
targeted market would find useful and then
providing product offerings as an attractive
supplement.
“The average consumer, whether in this coun-
try or overseas, wants to know who they are
doing business with, and to develop a relation-
ship with that person. A commercial Web site
not only enables you to express yourself, but
lets you create a ‘value-added’ experience for
your customers,” he concludes.

What happens if you want to receive payment in U.S. dollars from someone
overseas but the purchaser is reluctant to send cash? You can ask the pur-
chaser to send you a personal check — or, better yet, a cashier’s check —
but it’s up to the buyer to convert the local currency to U.S. dollars. You can
also suggest that the buyer obtain an International Money Order from a U.S.
bank that has a branch in his or her area, and specify that the money order
be payable in U.S. dollars. Suggest that your customers use an online cur-
rency conversion utility, such as the Bloomberg Online Currency Calculator
(www.bloomberg.com/analysis/calculators/currency.html), to do the
calculation.
You can also use an online escrow service, such as Escrow.com (www.escrow.
com) or Moneybookers.com (www.moneybookers.com), which holds funds
in escrow until you and your customer strike a deal, or Secure-Commerce
(www.secure-commerce.com.au), which specializes in transactions with
Australian companies. An escrow service holds the customer’s funds in a
trust account so that the seller can ship an item knowing that he or she will
be paid. The escrow service transfers the funds from buyer to seller after the
buyer has inspected the goods and approved them.
Escrow services usually accept credit card payments from overseas purchasers;
this is one way to accept credit card payments even if you don’t have a mer-
chant account yourself. The credit card company handles conversion from
the local currency into U.S. dollars.
If you’re going to do a lot of business overseas, consider getting export 
insurance to protect yourself against loss due to damage or delay in transit.
Policies are available from the Export-Import Bank of the United States
(www.exim.gov) or from other private firms that offer export insurance.

A
s the field of e-commerce becomes more competitive, e-litigation, 
e-patents, e-trademarks, and other means of legal protection multiply
correspondingly. The series of antitrust suits against Microsoft are only the
most notable examples. The courts are increasingly being called upon to
resolve smaller e-squabbles and, literally, lay down the e-law.
For instance, in April 2002, the popular search service Overture sued another
popular search service, Google, for allegedly stealing its patented system of
presenting search results based on bids placed by advertisers and Web sites.
In 2003, the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center was confronted with
1,100 domain name disputes — an average of three per day. Many of these were
filed by large corporations seeking to gain control over domain names that were
allegedly being held by small business cybersquatters that hold on to multiple
domain names in the hope of selling them. In summer 2004, Microsoft settled
a lawsuit it had filed in U.S. District Court by paying $20 million to stop a com-
pany called Lindows.com from infringing on its trademarked name Windows.
As a new business owner, you need to remember that ignorance is not an
excuse. This area may well make you nervous because you lack experience
in business law and you don’t have lots of money with which to hire lawyers
and accountants. You don’t want to be discovering for the first time about
copyright law or the concept of intellectual property when you’re in the
midst of a dispute. In this chapter, I give you a snapshot of legal issues that
you can’t afford to ignore. Hopefully, this information will help you head off
trouble before it occurs.

Note: This chapter was reviewed for accuracy by David M. Adler of the Chicago
law firm David M. Adler, Esq. & Associates, PC (www.ecommerceattorney.com).
Adler and his firm specialize in legal issues facing businesses that want to con-
duct e-commerce. Adler advises: “This chapter is a good starting point. But it
cannot begin to explain all the issues in the level of complexity to which they
exist, and [it] should be regarded as just the beginning of a discussion with a
competent lawyer who will look in detail at your individual facts and situation.” 
Trade Names and Trademarks
A trade name is the name by which a business is known in the marketplace. A
trade name can also be trademarked, which means that a business has taken
the extra step of registering its trade name so that others can’t use it. At the
same time, it’s important to realize that a trade name can be a trademark
even though it hasn’t been registered as such. The United States Patent and
Trademark Office defines a trademark as “a word, phrase, symbol, or design,
or a combination of words, phrases, symbols, or designs, that identifies and
distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others.” Big
corporations protect their trade names and trademarks jealously, and some-
times court battles erupt over who can legally use a name.
Although you may never get in a trademark battle yourself, and you may
never trademark a name, you need to be careful which trade name you pick
and how you use it. Choose a trade name that’s easy to remember so that
people can associate it with your company and return to you often when
they’re looking for the products or services that you provide. Also, as part of
taking your new business seriously and planning for success, you may want
to protect your right to use your name by registering the trademark, which is
a relatively easy and inexpensive process.
You can trademark any visual element that accompanies a particular tangible
product or line of goods, which serves to identify and distinguish it from prod-
ucts sold by other sources. In other words, a trademark is not necessarily
just for your business’s trade name. In fact, you can trademark letters, words,
names, phrases, slogans, numbers, colors, symbols, designs, or shapes. For
example, take a look at the cover of the book you’re reading right now. Look
closely and see how many ™or ® symbols you see. The same trademarked
items are shown at the Dummies Web site, as you can see in Figure 16-1. Even
though the For Dummies heading doesn’t bear a symbol, it’s a trademark —
believe me.
The ™mark can be used with items that may have been registered with a par-
ticular state but not with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The ® symbol
means the item has been registered with the aforementioned office.

Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

For most small businesses, the problem with trademarks is not so much pro-
tecting your own as it is stepping on someone else’s. Research the name you
want to use to make sure that you don’t run into trouble.
Determining whether a trademark 
is up for grabs
To avoid getting sued for trademark infringement and having to change your
trade name or even pay damages if you lose, you should conduct a trademark
search before you settle on a trade name. The goal of a trademark search is to
discover any potential conflicts between your trade name and someone else’s.
Ideally, you conduct the search before you actually use your trade name or
register for an official trademark.
“If you don’t have a registered trademark, your trade name becomes very dif-
ficult to protect,” comments David Adler. “It’s a good idea to do a basic search
on the Internet. But keep in mind that just because you don’t find a name on
the Internet doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Follow that up with a trademark
search. You don’t want to spend all the money required to develop a brand
name only to find that it isn’t yours.”

Chapter 16: Making It All Legal

The following list details three ways that you can do a trademark search:
 Search the old-fashioned manual way by visiting one of the Patent and
Trademark Depository Libraries: They are listed online at www.uspto.
gov/go/ptdl/ptdlib_1.html. While time consuming, this approach
doesn’t cost anything.
 Pay a professional search firm to do the research for you: Look for pro-
fessional search firms in the Yellow Pages under Trademark Consultants
or Information Brokers. You can expect to pay between $25 and $50 per
trademark searched. More complete searches that cover registered and
unregistered marks that are similar to the one you want to use can cost
several hundred dollars.
 Conduct a search online: Alternatively, you can use the Web and your
own computer to help you conduct a trademark search. The best place
to go is TESS, the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s federal
trademark database. This is the same as doing a search at a depository
library, but it’s convenient and also free. Just go to www.uspto.gov/
main/trademarks.htm and click the SEARCH Trademarks link.
Cyberspace goes beyond national boundaries. A trademark search in your
own country may not be enough. Most industrialized countries, including the
United States, have signed international treaties that enable trademark owners
in one country to enforce their rights against infringement by individuals in
another country. Conducting an international trademark search is difficult to
do yourself, so you may want to pay someone do the searching for you.
The consequences of failing to conduct a reasonably thorough trademark
search can be severe. In part, the consequences depend on how widely you
distribute the protected item — and on the Internet, you can distribute it
worldwide. If you attempt to use a trademark that has been federally regis-
tered by someone else, you could go to court and be prevented from using
the trademark again. You may even be liable for damages and attorney’s fees.
So it’s best to be careful.
Protecting your trade name
The legal standard is that you get the rights to your trade name when you
begin using it. You get the right to exclude others from using it when you reg-
ister. But when you apply to register a trademark, you record the date of its
first use. Effectively, then, the day you start using a name is when you actually
obtain the rights to use it for trade. 
In addition to a federal trademark law, each state has its own set of laws estab-
lishing when and how trademarks can be protected. You can obtain trademark
rights in the states in which the mark is actually used, but attorney Adler says
a federally registered trademark can trump such rights. It’s important, then,
to also file an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
340
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

After researching your trade name against existing trademarks, you can file
an application with the Patent and Trademark Office online by following
these steps:
1. Connect to the Net, start up your browser and go to the Trademark
Electronic Application System (TEAS) home page (www.uspto.gov/
teas/index.html, as shown in Figure 16-2).
This page includes a two-column table: The left column contains instruc-
tions on how to fill out your application online and pay by credit card;
the right column explains how to print out the application form and mail
it with a check to the Patent and Trademark Office.
2. Click the Apply for a NEW Mark link under Forms to file online.
A page with a list of application forms appears.
3. Click the Trademark/Servicemark Application, Principal Register link.
The Trademark/Service Mark Application Form Wizard page appears.
4. Select the appropriate radio buttons and menu options on this page
(note that you’re asked whether anyone else is already using the
desired trademark because the program assumes that you’ve done
a trademark search), and click Next at the bottom of the page.
An application form page appears.

341
Chapter 16: Making It All Legal

5. Fill out the required forms in the application, including your credit
card data (so that you can pay the $335 per application fee) and the
electronic signature fields at the bottom of the application.
6. You can attach a GIF or JPEG image of a symbol or logo that you want
to trademark by clicking the Attach an Image link.
A new page appears that lets you specify the image. Even though the
image you want to trademark may be in color, the image you submit with
your application must be in black-and-white form.
7. Click the Validate Form button at the bottom of the form.
If you filled out all the fields correctly, a Validation screen appears. If not,
you return to the original form page so that you can correct it.
8. Print the special declaration to support the adoption of the electronic
signature and retain it for your records, and then click the Submit
button.
You receive a confirmation screen if your transmission is successful.
Later, you will receive an e-mail acknowledgment of your submission.
Generally, each state has its own trademark laws, which apply only to trade-
marks to be used within a single state. Products that may be sold in more
than one state (such as those sold on the Internet) can be protected under the
federal Lanham Act, which provides for protection of registered trademarks.
In order to comply with the Lanham Act, you register your trademark as
described in the preceding series of steps.
Be prepared for a lengthy approval process after you file your application.
Trademark registration can take 18 to 24 months. It’s not uncommon to have an
application returned. Often, an applicant will receive a correspondence called
an Office Action that either rejects part of the application or raises a question
about it. If you receive such a letter, don’t panic. You need to go to a lawyer who
specializes in or is familiar with trademark law and who can help you respond
to the correspondence. In the meantime, you can still operate your business
with your trade name. You can also apply a form that communicates your intent
to use a trademark, which enables you to use a trademark before it is registered. 
Trademarks are listed in the trademarks register, last for 15 years, and are
renewable. You don’t have to use the ™or ® symbol when you publish your
trademark, but doing so impresses upon people how seriously you take your
business and its identity.
Making sure your domain name stays yours
The practice of choosing a domain name for an online business is related to
the concept of trade names and trademarks. By now, with cybersquatters and
342
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

other businesspeople snapping up domain names since 1994 or so, it’s unlikely
that your ideal name is available in the popular .com domain. It’s also likely
that another business has a domain name very similar to yours or to the
name of your business. There are two common problems:
 Someone else has already taken the domain name related to the name of
your existing business.
 The domain name you choose is close to one that already exists or to
another company with a similar name. (Remember the Microsoft Windows/
Lindows.com dispute that I mention at the beginning of this chapter?)
If the domain name that you think is perfect for your online business is already
taken, you have some options. You can contact the owner of the domain name
and offer to buy it. Alternatively, you can choose a domain name with another
suffix. If a dot-com name isn’t available, try the old standby alternatives, .org
(which, in theory at least, is for nonprofit organizations) and .net (which is
for network providers).
You can also choose one of the new Top-Level Domains (TLDs), a new set
of domain name suffixes that have been made available, which include the
following:
 .biz for businesses
 .info for general use
 .name for personal names
You can find out more about the new TLDs at the InterNIC Web site,
www.internic.net/faqs/new-tlds.html, and in Chapter 8.
You can always get around the fact that your perfect domain name isn’t avail-
able by changing the name slightly. Rather than treesurgeon.com, you
might choose tree-surgeon.com or treesurgery.com. But be careful, lest
you violate someone else’s trademark and get into a dispute with the holder
of the other domain name. A court may order you to stop using the name and
pay damages to the other domain name’s owner.
On the other hand, if you have been doing business for a while and have a
trademarked name, and you find someone else owns the domain name, you
can assert your rights and raise a dispute yourself. To resolve the dispute,
you would go to a group like the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center
(arbiter.wipo.int/center/index.html) or ICANN, the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (www.icann.org). But first, find out more
about what constitutes trademark infringement and how to enforce a trade-
mark. Go to Nolo.com’s Legal Encyclopedia (www.nolo.com/lawcenter/
ency/index.cfm), scroll down and click the Trademarks link, and then click
the Using and Enforcing Trademarks FAQ link.

Practicing Safe Copyright
What’s the difference between a trademark and a copyright? Trademarks are
covered by trademark law and are distinctive words, symbols, slogans, or other
things that serve to identify products or services in the marketplace. Copyright,
on the other hand, refers to the creator’s ownership of creative works, such as
writing, art, software, video, or cinema (but not names, titles, or short phrases).
Copyright also provides the owner with redress in case someone copies the
works without the owner’s permission. Copyright is a legal device that enables
the creator of a work the right to control how the work is to be used.
Although copyright protects the way ideas, systems, and processes are
embodied in the book, record, photo, or whatever, it doesn’t protect the idea,
system, or process itself. In other words, if Abraham Lincoln were writing the
Gettysburg Address today, his exact words would be copyrighted but the
general ideas he expressed would not be.
Even if nobody ever called you a nerd, as a businessperson who produces
goods and services of economic value, you may be the owner of intellectual
property. Intellectual property refers to works of authorship as well as certain
inventions. Because intellectual property may be owned, bought, and sold
just like other types of property, it’s important that you know something
about the copyright laws governing intellectual property. Having this infor-
mation maximizes the value of your products and keeps you from throwing
away potentially valuable assets or finding yourself at the wrong end of an
expensive lawsuit.
Copyright you can count on
These days, the controversy regarding copyright on the Web centers on the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which calls for Internet radio sta-
tions to pay high royalty fees to record labels for music they play. The DMCA
contains at least one provision that has implications for all online businesses:
Internet service providers are expected to remove material from any customer
Web sites that appears to constitute copyright infringement. So it pays to know
something about copyright.
Everything you see on the Net is copyrighted, whether or not a copyright
notice actually appears. Copyright exists from the moment a work is fixed in a
tangible medium, including a Web page. For example, plenty of art is available
for the taking on the Web, but look before you grab. Unless an image on the
Web is specified as being copyright free, you’ll be violating copyright law if
you take it. HTML tags themselves aren’t copyrighted, but the content of the
HTML-formatted page is. General techniques for designing Web pages are not
copyrighted, but certain elements (such as logos) are.
344
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

Keep in mind that it’s okay to use a work for criticism, comment, news report-
ing, teaching, scholarship, or research. That comes under the “fair use” 
limitation. (See the nearby sidebar, “Fair use . . . and how not to abuse it” for
more information.) However, I still contend that it’s best to get permission or
cite your source in these cases, just to be safe.
Making copyright work for you
A copyright — which protects original works of authorship — costs nothing,
applies automatically, and lasts more than 50 years. When you affix a copyright
notice to your newsletter or Web site, you make your readers think twice about
unauthorized copying and put them on notice that you take copyright seriously.
You can go a step further and register your work with the U.S. Copyright Office.
Creating a good copyright notice
Even though any work you do is automatically protected by copyright, having
some sort of notice expresses your copyright authority in a more official way.
Copyright notices identify the author of a given work (such as writing or soft-
ware) and then spell out the terms by which that author grants others the right
(or the license) to copy that work to their computer and read it (or use it).
The usual copyright notice is pretty simple and takes this form:
Copyright 2005 [Your Name] All rights reserved
You don’t have to use the © symbol, but it does make your notice look more
official. In order to create a copyright symbol that appears on a Web page,
you have to enter a special series of characters in the HTML source code for
your page. For example, Web browsers translate the characters &copy; as
345
Chapter 16: Making It All Legal
Fair use . . . and how not to abuse it
Copyright law doesn’t cover everything. One of the
major limitations is the doctrine of fair use, which
is described in Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright
Act. The law states that fair use of a work is use
that does not infringe copyright “for purposes
such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
teaching (including multiple copies for class-
room use), scholarship, or research.” You can’t
copy text from online magazines or newsletters
and call it fair use because the text was origi-
nally news reporting.
Fair use has some big gray areas that can be
traps for people who provide information on the
Internet. Don’t fall into one of these traps. Shooting
off a quick e-mail asking someone for permis-
sion to reproduce his or her work isn’t difficult.
Chances are, that person will be flattered and will
let you make a copy as long as you give him or her
credit on your site. Fair use is entirely dependent
on the unique circumstances of each individual
case, and this is an area where, if you have any
questions, you should consult with an attorney.

the copyright symbol, which is displayed as © in the Web browser window.
Most Web page creation tools provide menu options for inserting special
symbols such as this one.
Copyright notices can also be more informal, and a personal message can have
extra impact. The graphic design company Echoed Sentiments Publishing
(www.espconcepts.com) includes both the usual copyright notice plus
a very detailed message about how others can use its design elements
(www.espconcepts.com/gratis_design_elements.html).
Protection with digital watermarks
In traditional offset printing, a watermark is a faint image embedded in sta-
tionery or other paper. The watermark usually bears the name of the paper
manufacturer, but it can also identify an organization for whom the stationery
was made.
Watermarking has its equivalent in the online world. Graphic artists some-
times use a technique called digital watermarking to protect images they
create. This process involves adding copyright or other information about
the image’s owner to the digital image file. The information added may or
may not be visible. (Some images have copyright information added, not visi-
ble in the body of the Web page but in the image file itself.) Other images,
such as the one shown in Figure 16-3, have a watermark pasted right into the
visible area, which makes it difficult for others to copy and reuse them.

Digimarc (www.digimarc.com), which functions as a plug-in application
with the popular graphics tools Adobe Photoshop (www.adobe.com) and
Paint Shop Pro 7 (www.jasc.com), is one of the most widely used water-
marking tools.
Doing the paperwork on your copyright
You have copyright over the materials you publish on the Web, but there’s
a difference between having copyright and having a registered copyright.
Registering your copyright is something I recommend for small businesses
because it’s inexpensive and easy to do, and it affords you an extra degree of
protection. Having registered your copyright gives your case more weight in
the event of a copyright dispute; it enables you to claim statutory damages of
$150,000 if you can prove that there has been an infringement. You don’t need
to register, but doing so shows a court how serious you are about obtaining
protection for your work.
Registering copyright is a breeze compared to the process of registering a
trademark. To register your work, you can download a short application form
from the U.S. Copyright Office Web site at www.loc.gov/copyright/forms.
This form is in Adobe Acrobat PDF format, so you need Acrobat Reader to
view it. (Adobe Acrobat Reader is a free application that you can download
from the Adobe Systems Incorporated Web site at www.adobe.com.) You can
then send the form by snail mail, along with a check for $35 and a printed
copy of the work you are protecting, to Library of Congress, Copyright Office,
101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, DC 20559-6000.
At this writing, the Copyright Office’s online registration system (which is
called CORDS) is still being tested and is not yet widely available.
Restrictions Such as Licensing
Another set of legal concerns that you must be aware of when you start an
online business involves any license fees or restrictions that are levied by local
agencies. Some fees are specific to businesses that have incorporated, which
brings up the question of whether you should consider incorporation for your
own small business. (I discuss the legal concerns and pros and cons of incor-
poration in the upcoming section, “Your Business in the Eyes of the Law.”)
Local regulations you should heed
Before you get too far along with your online business, make sure that you have
met any local licensing requirements that apply. For example, in my county in
the state of Illinois, I had to pay a $10 fee to register my sole proprietorship.
In return, I received a nice certificate that made everything feel official.
347
Chapter 16: Making It All Legal

Other localities may have more stringent requirements, however. Check with
city, county, and state licensing and/or zoning offices. Trade associations for
your profession often have a wealth of information about local regulations as
well. Also, check with your local chamber of commerce. If you fail to apply for
a permit or license, you may find yourself paying substantial fines.
The kinds of local regulations to which a small business may be susceptible
include the following:
 Zoning: Your city or town government may have zoning ordinances that
prevent you from conducting business in an area that is zoned for residen-
tial use, or they may charge you a fee to operate a business out of your
home. This policy varies by community; even if your Web host resides in
another state, your local government may still consider your home the
location of your business. Check with your local zoning department.
 Doing Business As: If your business name is different from your own
name, you may have to file a Doing Business As (DBA) certificate and
publish a notice of the filing in the local newspaper. Check with your city
or county clerk’s office for more information.
 Taxes: Some states and cities levy taxes on small businesses, and some
even levy property tax on business assets such as office furniture and
computer equipment.
Restrictions that may restrict your trade
If you are planning to sell your goods and services overseas, you need to be
aware of any trade restrictions that may apply to your business. In particular,
you need to be careful if any of the following applies:
 You trade in foodstuffs or agricultural products.
 You sell software that uses some form of encryption.
 Your clients live in countries with which your home country has
imposed trade restrictions.
For more detailed suggestions of how to research international trade law, see
Chapter 15.
The Arent Fox Web site, which is run by a Washington, D.C.-based law firm,
has lots of good legal information for people who want to do business online.
Of particular interest is its E-TIPSheet (www.arentfox.com/publications/
E-TIPSheet/e-tipsheet.html), which publishes news about trademark,
licensing, and doing business internationally on the Internet.

Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

Your Business in the Eyes of the Law
Picking a legal form for your online business enables you to describe it to city
and county agencies as well as to the financial institutions with which you
deal. A legal type of business is one that is recognized by taxing and licensing
agencies. You have a number of options from which to choose, and the choice
can affect the amount of taxes you pay and your liability in case of loss. The
following sections describe your alternatives.
If you’re looking for more information, Eric Tyson and Jim Schell explore the
legal and financial aspects of starting and operating a small business in Small
Business For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
Sole proprietorship
In a sole proprietorship, you’re the only boss. You make all the decisions and
you get all the benefits. On the other hand, you take all the risk, too. This is
the simplest and least expensive type of business because you can run it
yourself. You don’t need an accountant or lawyer to help you form the busi-
ness, and you don’t have to answer to partners or stockholders, either. To
declare a sole proprietorship, you may have to file an application with your
county clerk.
Partnership
In a partnership, you share the risk and profit with at least one other person.
Ideally, your partners bring skills to the endeavor that complement your own
contributions. One obvious advantage to a partnership is that you can discuss
decisions and problems with your partners. All partners are held personally
liable for losses. The rate of taxes that each partner pays is based on his or
her percentage of income from the partnership.
If you decide to strike up a partnership with someone, drawing up a
Partnership Agreement is a good idea. Although you aren’t legally required to
do so, such an agreement clearly spells out the duration of the partnership
and the responsibilities of each person involved. In the absence of such an
agreement, the division of liabilities and assets is considered to be equal,
regardless of how much more effort one person has put into the business
than the other.
349
Chapter 16: Making It All Legal

Advantages of a statutory business entity
A statutory business entity is a business whose form is created by statute, such
as a corporation or a limited liability company. If sole proprietorships and
partnerships are so simple to start up and operate, why would you consider
incorporating? After all, you almost certainly need a lawyer to help you incor-
porate. Plus, you have to comply with the regulations made by federal and
state agencies that oversee corporations. Besides that, you may undergo a
type of double taxation: If your corporation earns profits, those profits are
taxed at the corporate rate, and any shareholders have to pay income tax at
the personal rate.
Despite these downsides, you may want to consider incorporation for the fol-
lowing sorts of reasons:
 If you have employees, you can deduct any health and disability insur-
ance premiums that you pay.
 You can raise capital by offering stock for sale.
 Transferring ownership from one shareholder to another is easier.
 The company’s principals are shielded from liability in case of lawsuits.
If you offer services that may be susceptible to costly lawsuits, incorporation
may be the way to go. You then have three options: a C corporation, a sub-
chapter S corporation, or a limited liability corporation (LLC). The LLC is the
best choice for many small businesses. But you have to designate officers,
hold shareholders’ meetings, and have an attorney keep the minutes of those
meetings. Although it’s more expensive to create, the LLC is simpler to operate
and more suitable for lone entrepreneurs.
Subchapter S corporations
One benefit of forming a subchapter S corporation is liability protection.
This form of incorporation enables start-up businesses that encounter losses
early on to offset those losses against their personal income. Subchapter S is
intended for businesses with fewer than 75 shareholders. The income gained
by an S corporation is subject only to personal tax, not corporate tax.
You might designate that you are the president, your cousin Nick is the 
secretary, and other relatives serve as your shareholders and officers. Many
corporations that are run by only one or two people have only one make-
believe meeting a year; the attorney has a quick phone call to record what
“happened” at the meeting and files the appropriate papers. 
Sounds great, doesn’t it? Before you start looking for a lawyer to get you
started, consider the following:
350
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

 Incorporation typically costs several hundred dollars.
 Corporations must pay an annual tax.
 Attorneys’ fees can be expensive.
 Filing for S corporation status can take weeks or months to be received
and approved. (You need to meet your state’s requirements for setting
up a corporation, and then file Form 2553 to elect S corporation status.)
All these facts can be daunting for a lone entrepreneur who’s just starting out
and has only a few customers. But my brother Mike, who is mentioned in
Chapter 1 and who is just starting up an audio restoration business called
lp2cdsolutions (www.lp2cdsolutions.com), did create an S corporation, so
his liability is limited: In case of a lawsuit, assuming there is no illegal con-
duct on the part of the owner, the corporation is sued, not him personally. I
recommend that you wait until you have enough income to hire an attorney
and pay incorporation fees before you seriously consider incorporating, even
as an S corporation.
C corporations
Many big businesses do not meet the strict requirements to become C corpo-
rations. In fact, everything about C corporations tends to be big — including
profits, which are taxed at the corporate level as well as at the shareholder
level — so I mention this legal designation only in passing because it’s proba-
bly not for your small entrepreneurial business. 
C corporations tend to be large and have lots of shareholders. In order to
incorporate, all stockholders and shareholders must agree on the name of
the company, the choice of the people who will manage it, and many other
issues. The issue of double taxation in connection with C corporations means
that you need to contact a tax professional if you have questions about this
business entity or are thinking of creating one. 
Limited liability corporations
The limited liability corporation (LLC) is a relatively new type of corporation
that combines aspects of both S and C corporations. The forms required to
create LLCs cost $500, and that doesn’t include an attorney’s fees. However,
limited liability corporations have a number of attractive options that make
them good candidates for small businesses. Benefits include the following:
 Members have limited liability for debts and obligations of the LLC.
 LLCs receive favorable tax treatment.
 The individual investors, who are called members, share income and
losses.
351
Chapter 16: Making It All Legal

An LLC can be a sole proprietorship, corporation, or a partnership. A similar
entity, a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) needs to be a partnership. The
responsibilities of LLP members are spelled out in an operating agreement, an
often complex document that should be prepared by a knowledgeable attorney.
Keeping Out of Legal Trouble
A big part of keeping your online business legal is steering clear of so-called
business opportunities that can turn into big problems. You can run into trou-
ble both at the federal or the local level. In the following sections, I highlight
some areas to watch out for.
Get it in writing!
Perhaps the most important way to avoid legal trouble is to get all of your
agreements in writing. Even if the parties involved type up and sign a simple
one-page sheet describing what is to be done and what is to be paid, that’s
far better than a verbal agreement. It’s also better than an e-mail message —
an e-mail doesn’t enable signatures, and a single message doesn’t clearly
point out that both parties have actually agreed to something. A qualified
lawyer can help you prepare contracts that you can send to both suppliers
and customers who engage your services. 
The other important things to get in writing are policy statements: statements
that spell out how a customer is to use your goods or services, or statements
as to how you manage your customers’ personal information. Such statements
build trust among your clientele. But remember that, when you publish a policy
statement on your Web site, you need to actually follow what it prescribes;
you can be sued if you violate it. 
Is multilevel marketing worth it?
Be careful if you undertake multilevel marketing (MLM), also known as network
marketing. Multilevel marketing /network marketing is a strategy used by many
reputable firms, such as Amway: You recruit some people to help you, and
those people, in turn, recruit others to help them. No doubt, some network
marketers are on the up and up. But other companies (many of which you
can find online) use MLM to run an old-fashioned pyramid scheme in which
the participants recruit other investors. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t
look into network marketing at all; I’m saying that you should be very careful
about how much money you have to commit in order to play the game.
352
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

The U.S. Postal Service treats MLM businesses as lotteries; go to www.usps.
gov/websites/depart/inspect/pyramid.htm to read the warning about
them. Fraudulent pyramid schemes typically violate the Postal Lottery Statute
(Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302). Yahoo! also maintains a list of
Web pages that warn against MLM schemes, which you can find at dir.
yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/Business_
Opportunities/Network_Marketing. Don’t be taken in by someone who
wants you to participate in a questionable MLM-type scheme.
Adult content is risky business
Be careful if you provide so-called adult content. There’s no doubt about it:
Cyberspace is full of X-rated sites, some of which do make money. But this is
a risky area. Congress continues to debate legislation that may legally require
online vendors of adult material to restrict access to sites by persons less
than 17 years of age. Additionally, many ISPs prohibit you from publishing
Web pages that contain adult content.
If you do sell adult items online, consider working with a blocking company,
such as CyberPatrol (www.cyberpatrol.com) or Net Nanny (www.netnanny.
com/home/home.asp) that can prevent minors from visiting your site.

A potty mouth can flush your 
business down the toilet
Ever heard of the “seven dirty words” made
famous in a routine by comedian George Carlin?
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
has banned them from being uttered on TV and
radio broadcasts. However, the FCC does not
regulate the Internet. The U.S. Supreme Court
struck down the Communications Decency Act,
which sought to regulate “obscene” communi-
cations on the Internet. Then Congress passed
the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), but it
was struck down in federal court.
Now, there’s the Children’s Internet Protection Act
(CIPA), which was signed into law by President
Bill Clinton in late 2000. It requires schools and
libraries to filter pornography, obscenity, and
other material deemed offensive to children. At
this writing it, too, is being challenged in court.
It might seem like you can say whatever you
want online. But you might get your site filtered
out, not only by a librarian but also by a parent
using child-safety software. So use your judg-
ment as a businessperson. You don’t want to
turn away potential customers by your choice
of language. Also, make sure you don’t violate
your ISP’s terms of use, lest you find your Web
site suddenly offline.

What you don’t know about acceptable
use policies can hurt you
Be aware of acceptable use policies set up by agencies that control what
goes out online. Usually, the company that hosts your Web site has a set of
acceptable use guidelines spelling out what kind of material you can and
can’t publish. For example, America Online has its own policies for its mem-
bers who create home pages through AOL.
Another important kind of acceptable use policy that you need to know about
is the acceptable use policy issued by your Internet service provider. The most
common restriction is one against spamming (sending out unsolicited bulk
mailings). Not following your Web host’s or your ISP’s guidelines can get you
kicked off the Internet, so make sure that you’re aware of any restrictions by
reading the guidelines posted on your ISP’s or Web host’s site.
The tax man cometh
Sales tax varies from state to state. Your job as an online storeowner is to
charge the sales tax rate applicable in the state in which the purchase is
made — that is, the state where your customer lives, not where you live.
(See Chapter 17 for a more detailed examination of the sales tax situation.)
Luckily, computer software is available to help you calculate sales taxes for
every state. Many Web hosting services or ISPs also help with sales tax collec-
tion, among their other services. Shopping cart programs and some electronic
storefront programs, such as the ones that I discuss in Chapter 9, help you
calculate sales tax, too.
If you don’t have a hosting service or ISP to provide you with e-commerce
software, however, you have to download software or look up sales tax rates
on your own. A wonderful utility called Online Sales Tax Calculator, provided
by the Sales Tax Clearinghouse, will do the work for you. Just access the calcu-
lator at thestc.com/RateCalc.stm. Enter your home state and the city and
state where your customer resides. Click the Lookup button, and the calculator
will not only look up the county where the customer resides but also report
any applicable local sales taxes and calculate them for you. If you need to cal-
culate Canadian sales taxes, you can download a shareware application called
Sales Tax Calculator, by Carter Computer Solutions (www.niagara.com/
~mcarter/taxw.htm). You can download and try the program for 30 days;
if you want to keep Sales Tax Calculator, you need to pay a modest $10 fee.

S
ome people have a gift for keeping track of expenses, recording financial
information, and performing other fiscal functions. Unfortunately, I’m not
one of those people. Yet I know well the value of accounting procedures,
especially those that relate to an online business.
Without having at least some minimal records of your day-to-day opera-
tions, you won’t have any way — other than the proverbial “gut feeling” —
of knowing whether your business is truly successful. Besides that, banks
and taxing authorities don’t put much stock in gut feelings. When the time
comes to ask for a loan or to pay taxes, you’ll regret not having records close
at hand.
In this chapter, I introduce you to some simple, straightforward ways to
handle your online business’s financial information — and all business-
people know that accurate record keeping is essential when revenues 
dwindle and expenses must be reduced. Read on to discover the most 
important accounting practices and find out about software that can help
you tackle the essential fiscal tasks that you need to undertake to keep your
new business viable.

ABCs: Accounting Basics for Commerce
The most important accounting practices for your online business can be
summarized as follows:
 Deciding what type of business you’re going to be: Are you going to
be a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation? (See more about
determining a legal form for your business in Chapter 16.)
 Establishing good record keeping practices: Record expenses and
income in ways that will help you at tax time.
 Obtaining financing when you need it: Although getting started in busi-
ness online doesn’t cost a lot, you may want to expand someday, and
good accounting can help you do it.
There’s nothing sexy about accounting (unless, of course, you’re married to
an accountant; in that case, you have a financial expert at hand and can skip
this chapter anyway!). Then again, there’s nothing enjoyable about unexpected
cash shortages or other problems that can result from bad record keeping.
Good accounting is the key to order and good management for your business.
How else can you know how you’re doing? Yet many new businesspeople are
intimidated by the numbers game. Use the tool at hand — your computer —
to help you overcome your fear: Start keeping those books!
Choosing an accounting method
Accepting that you have to keep track of your business’s accounting is only
half the battle; next, you need to decide how to do it. The point at which you
make note of each transaction in your books and the period of time over which
you record the data make a difference not only to your accountant but also to
agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service. Even if you hire someone to
keep the books for you, it’s good to know what options are open to you.
You don’t have to take my word for all this. Consult the Internal Revenue
Service Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Businesses (www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-pdf/p334.pdf). Review section 2, Accounting Periods and Methods,
which explains how to do everything right when tax time comes. Also check
out the Accounting System section of the CCH Business Owner’s Toolkit site
(www.toolkit.cch.com/text/P06_1300.asp).
Cash-basis versus accrual-basis accounting
Don’t be intimidated by these terms: They are simply two methods of totaling
up income and expenses. Exactly where and how you do the recording is up
to you. You can take a piece of paper, divide it into two columns labeled
Income and Expenses, and do it that way. (I describe some more high-tech
356
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

tools later in this chapter.) These are just two standard ways of deciding
when to report them:
 Cash-basis accounting: You report income when you actually receive it
and write off expenses when you pay them. This is the easy way to report
income and expenses, and probably the way most new small businesses
do it.
 Accrual-basis accounting: This method is more complicated than the
cash-basis method, but if your online business maintains an inventory,
you must use the accrual method. You report income when you actually
receive the payment; you write down expenses when services are ren-
dered (even though you may not have made the cash payment yet). For
example, if a payment is due on December 1, but you send the check out
on December 8, you record the bill as being paid on December 1, when
the payment was originally due. Accrual-basis accounting creates a more
accurate picture of a business’s financial situation. If a business is expe-
riencing cash flow problems and is extending payments on some of its
bills, cash-basis accounting provides an unduly rosy financial picture,
whereas the accrual-basis method would be more accurate.
Choosing an accounting period
The other choice you need to make when it comes to deciding how to keep
your books is the accounting period you’re going to use. Here, again, you
have two choices:
 Calendar year: The calendar year ends on December 31. This is the
period with which you’re probably most familiar and the one most
small or home-based businesses choose because it’s the easiest to
work with.
 Fiscal year: In this case, the business picks a date other than December
31 to function as the end of the fiscal year. Many large organizations pick
a date that coincides with the end of their business cycle. Some pick
March 31 as the end, others June 30, and still others September 30.
If you use the fiscal-year method of accounting, you must file your tax return
three and a half months after the end of the fiscal year. If the fiscal year ends
on June 30, for example, you must file by October 15.
Knowing what records to keep
When you run your own business, it pays to be meticulous about recording
everything that pertains to your commercial activities. The more you under-
stand what you have to record, the more accurate your records will be — and
the more deductions you can take, too. Go to the office supply store and get a
financial record book called a journal, which is set up with columns for income
and expenses.

Chapter 17: Online Business Accounting Tools

Tracking income
Receiving checks for your goods or services is the fun part of doing business,
and so income is probably the kind of data that you’ll be happiest about
recording.
You need to keep track of your company’s income (or, as it is sometimes called,
your gross receipts) carefully. Not all the income your business receives is tax-
able. What you receive as a result of sales (your revenue) is taxable, but loans
that you receive aren’t. Be sure to separate the two and pay tax only on the
sales income. But keep good records: If you can’t accurately report the source
of income that you didn’t pay taxes on, the IRS will label it unreported income,
and you’ll have to pay taxes and possibly fines and penalties on it.
Just how should you record your revenue? For each item, write down a brief,
informal statement. This is a personal record that you may make on a slip of
paper or even on the back of a canceled check. Be sure to include the follow-
ing information:
 Amount received
 Type of payment (credit card, electronic cash, or check)
 Date of the transaction
 Name of client or customer
 Goods or services you provided in exchange for the payment
Collect all your check stubs and revenue statements in a folder labeled Income
so that you can find them easily at tax time.
Assessing your assets
Assets are resources that your business owns, such as your office and com-
puter equipment. Equity refers to your remaining assets after you pay your
creditors.
Any equipment you have that contributes to your business activities con-
stitutes your assets. Equipment that has a life span of more than a year is
expected to help you generate income over its useful life; therefore, you must
spread out (or, in other words, expense) the original cost of the equipment
over its life span. Expensing the cost of an asset over the period of its useful
life is called depreciation. In order to depreciate an item, you estimate how
many years you’re going to use it and then divide the original cost by the
number of years. The result is the amount that you report in any given year.
For example, if you purchase a computer that costs $3,000 and you expect to
use it in your business for five years, you expense $600 of the cost each year.
358
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

You need to keep records of your assets that include the following information:
 Name, model number, and description
 Purchase date
 Purchase price, including fees
 Date the item went into service
 Amount of time the item is put to personal (as opposed to business) use
File these records in a safe location along with your other tax-related 
information.
Recording payments
Even a lone entrepreneur doesn’t work in a vacuum. An online business owner
needs to pay a Web host, an ISP, and possibly Web page designers and other
consultants. If you take on partners or employees, things get more complicated.
But in general, you need to record all payments such as these in detail as well.
Your accountant is likely to bring up the question of how you pay the people
who work for you. You have two options: You can treat them either as full- or
part-time employees or as independent contractors. The IRS uses a stringent
series of guidelines to determine who is a contractor and who is a full-time
employee. Refer to the IRS Publication 15A (www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.
pdf), which discusses the employee/independent contractor subject in detail.
Hiring independent contractors rather than salaried workers is far simpler
for you: You don’t have to pay benefits to independent contractors, and you
don’t have to withhold federal and state taxes. Just be sure to get invoices
from any independent contractor who works for you. If you have full-time
employees whom you pay an hourly wage, things get more complicated, and
you had best consult an accountant to help you set up the salary payments.
Listing expenses
When you break down business expenses on Schedule C (Profit or Loss from
Business) of your federal tax return, you need to keep track of two kinds of
expenses:
 The first type of expenses (simply called “Expenses” in Part II of
Schedule C) includes travel, business meals, advertisements, postage,
and other costs that you incur in order to produce revenue.
 The second kind of expenses (grouped under “Other Expenses” in Part V
of Schedule C) includes instances when you’re just exchanging one asset
(cash) for another (a printer or modem, for example).
359
Chapter 17: Online Business Accounting Tools

The difference between “Expenses” and “Other Expenses” lies in how close the
relationship is between the expense and revenue produced. In the case of the
Part II “Expenses,” your expenditure is directly related — you wouldn’t take
out an advertisement or take a business trip if you didn’t expect it to produce
revenue. In the second case, the act of spending money doesn’t directly result
in more revenue for you. You would purchase a modem, for instance, to help
you communicate and get information online, not just to boost your bottom
line. You do hope, though, that the equipment being purchased will eventually
help you produce revenue.
Get a big folder and use it to hold any receipts, contracts, canceled checks,
credit card statements, or invoices that represent expenses. It’s also a great
idea to maintain a record of expenses that includes the following information:
 Date the expense occurred
 Name of the person or company that received payment from you
 Type of expense incurred (equipment, utilities, supplies, and so on)
Recalling exactly what some receipts were for is often difficult a year or even
just a month after the fact. Be sure to jot down a quick note on all canceled
checks and copies of receipts to remind you of what the expense involved.
Understanding the Ps and Qs of P&Ls
You’re likely to hear the term profit-and-loss statement (also called a P&L)
thrown around when discussing your online business with financial people. A
P&L is a report that measures the operation of a business over a given period
of time, such as a week, a month, or a year. The person who prepares the P&L
(either you or your accountant) adds up your business revenues and subtracts
the operating expenses. What’s left are either the profits or the losses.
Most of the accounting programs listed later in this chapter (and in the Internet
Directory on this book’s Web site) include some way of presenting profit-and-
loss statements and enable you to customize the statements to fit your needs.
Accounting Software for Your Business
The well-known commercial accounting packages, such as Quicken, Microsoft
Money, QuickBooks, and MYOB, let you prepare statements and reports and
even tie into a tax preparation system. Stick with these programs if you like
setting up systems such as databases on your computer. Otherwise, go for a
simpler method and hire an accountant to help you.
360
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

Whatever program you choose, make sure that you’re able to keep accurate
books and set up privacy and backup schemes that prevent your kids from
zapping your business records.
If your business is a relatively simple sole proprietorship, you can record
expenses and income by hand and add them up at tax time. Then carry them
through to Schedule C or IRS Form 1040. Alternatively, you can record your
entries and turn them over to a tax advisor who will prepare a profit-and-loss
statement and tell you the balance due on your tax payment.

The Tax Man Cometh: Concerns 
for Small Business
After you make it through the start-up phase of your business, it’s time to be
concerned with taxes. Here, too, a little preparation up front can save you
lots of headaches down the road. But as a hard-working entrepreneur, time is
your biggest obstacle.
In an American Express survey, 26 percent reported that they wait until the
last minute to start preparing their taxes, and 13.9 percent said that they usu-
ally ask for an extension. Yet advance planning is really important for taxes.
In fact, Internal Revenue Code Section 6001 mandates that businesses must
keep records appropriate to their trade or business. The IRS has the right to
view these records if they want to audit your business’s (or your personal)
tax return. If your records aren’t to the IRS’s satisfaction, the penalties can be
serious.
364
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

Should you charge sales tax?
This is one of the most frequently asked questions I receive from readers:
Should I charge sales tax for what I sell online? The short answer is that it
depends on whether or not your state collects sales tax at all. There’s no
single regulation that applies to all states equally.
If your state doesn’t collect sales tax (at this writing, five states — Montana,
Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Oregon — do not), you don’t need to,
either. However, if your state requires it, yes, you need to collect sales tax —
but only from customers who live in the same state where your company has
a “physical presence.” A state’s tax laws apply only within its own borders. If
you’re located in Ohio, for instance, your business is subject to Ohio sales
tax regulations, but only for transactions that are completed in Ohio. If you
sell to someone in, say, California, you don’t need to collect sales tax from
that California resident. But because tax laws change frequently, the safest
thing I can tell you is to check with your own state’s department of revenue
to make sure.
The nature of what constitutes a “physical presence” varies. Some states
define it as an office or warehouse. If you take orders only by phone or
online, you don’t have to collect sales tax. But again, check with your state.
Also, most states require that their merchants charge sales tax on shipping
and handling charges as well as the purchase price.
One good piece of news is that the president signed the Internet Tax Non-
Discrimination Act, an extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which calls
for a freeze on new taxes on Internet access and e-commerce until 2007. You
can read the text of the bill at www.theorator.com/bills108/s150.html.
The Internet Tax Freedom Act does not mean that Internet sales are free from
sales tax. It means only that states can’t impose any new sales tax require-
ments on Internet merchants over and above what other merchants already
have to collect in sales tax. To deal with this supposed loophole, most states
charge a “use” tax in addition to a sales tax: If a resident of the state makes a
purchase from another state, the transaction is still subject to use tax. But
one state can’t compel a merchant located in another state to collect its use
tax — only merchants located within its own borders.
Sales tax varies from state to state, city to city, and county to county. Some
states tax only sales of tangible personal property, while others tax services
as well. Not only that, but some counties and municipalities levy local taxes
on sales. Check with your local comptroller or department of revenue to find
out for sure what your requirements are.

Chapter 17: Online Business Accounting Tools

Federal and state taxes
Although operating a business does complicate your tax return, it’s some-
thing you can handle if your business is a simple one-person operation, if
you’re willing to expend the time, and finally, if you have kept the proper
business records.
If you have a sole proprietorship, you need to file IRS form Schedule C along
with your regular form 1040 tax return. If your sole proprietorship has net
income, you’re also required to file Schedule SE to determine any Social
Security and FICA taxes that are due.
State taxes vary depending on where you live. You most likely need to file sales
tax and income tax. If you have employees, you also need to pay employee
withholding tax. Contact a local accountant in order to find out what you
have to file, or contact the state tax department yourself. Most state tax
offices provide guidebooks to help you understand state tax requirements.
When you start making money for yourself independently, rather than
depending on a regular paycheck from an employer, you have to start doing
something you’ve probably never done before: You have to start estimating
the tax you will have to pay based on the income from your own business.
You’re then required to pay this tax on a quarterly basis, both to the IRS and
to your state taxing agency. Estimating and paying quarterly taxes is an
important part of meeting your tax obligations as a self-employed person.
A page full of links to state tax agencies is available at www.tannedfeet.com/
state_tax_agencies.htm.
Deducing your business deductions
One of the benefits of starting a new business, even if the business isn’t prof-
itable in the beginning, is the opportunity to take business deductions and
reduce your tax payments. Always keep receipts from any purchases or
expenses associated with your business activities. Make sure that you’re
taking all the deductions for which you’re eligible. I mention some of these
deductions in the following sections.
Your home office
If you work at home (and I’m assuming that, as an entrepreneur, you probably
do), set aside some space for a home office. This isn’t just a territorial thing.
It can result in some nifty business deductions, too.
366
Part V: The Necessary Evils: Law and Accounting 

Taking a home office deduction used to be difficult because a 1993 Supreme
Court decision stated that, unless you met with clients, customers, or patients
on a regular basis in your home office, you couldn’t claim the home-office
deduction. However, the 1997 tax law eliminates the client requirement and
requires only that the office be used “regularly and exclusively” for business.
What you deduct depends on the amount of space in your home that’s used
for your business. If your office consumes 96 square feet of a house with 960
square feet of living/working space, you can deduct 10 percent of your utili-
ties, for example. However, if you have a separate phone line that’s solely for
business use, you can deduct 100 percent of that expense.
Your computer equipment
Computer equipment is probably the biggest expense related to your online
business. But taking tax deductions can help offset the cost substantially. The
key is showing the IRS (by reporting your income from your online business
on your tax return) that you used your PC and related items, such as modems
or printers, for business purposes. You track what you spend on computer
equipment in the “Other Expenses” section, which is Part V of Schedule C in
your federal tax return.
In case you’re ever audited, be sure to keep some sort of record detailing all
the ways in which you have put your computer equipment to use for business
purposes. If less than half of your computer use is for your business, consider
depreciating its cost over several years.
Other common business deductions
Many of the business-related expenses that you can deduct are listed on IRS
form Schedule C. The following is a brief list of some of the deductions you
can look for:
 Advertising fees
 Internet access charges
 Computer supplies
 Shipping and delivery
 Office supplies
 Utilities fees that pertain to your home office

Ten Must-Have Features 
for Your Web Site
You can put any number of snazzy features on your Web site. If you ever
meet with a Web design firm, you’re sure to hear about all the cool scripts,
animations, and other interactive add-ons that can go on your pages. Some
pizzazz isn’t a bad thing, especially if you are just starting out and need to set
yourself apart from the competition. Interactive features and a well-designed
Web site give you an air of competence and experience, even if your online
business is brand new. 
But the Web site features that count toward your bottom line are the ones
that attract and retain customers and induce them to return to you regularly.
Along with the bells and whistles, your business home on the Web needs to
have some basic must-haves that shoppers expect. Make sure your site
meets the minimum daily requirements: It needs to be easy to find, loaded
with content, include content and background information about you, and
include features that make shopping easy and secure. This Part of Tens chap-
ter describes ten specific features that will help you achieve these objectives. 
Secure some easy-to-remember URLs
Names are critical to the success of any business. A name becomes identified
with a business, and people associate the name with its products and its level
of customer service. When a small company developed a software product
called Lindows, giant Microsoft sued and eventually paid $20 million to stop
the infringement on its well-known trademarked product Windows. 
Write down five or six names that are short and easy to remember and that
would represent your business if included in an URL. Do a domain name
search and try to find the one you want. (A good place to search is Whois.net,
www.whois.net). Try to keep your site’s potential name as short and as free
of elements like hyphens as possible. A single four- to ten-character name in
between the www. and the .com sections of the URL will be easy to remember. 

Domain names are cheap, especially if you are able to lock them up for sev-
eral years at a time. A name in the .com domain is still the most desirable
type of URL suffix because it’s the one that most consumers expect to see
when they’re trying to find your Web site’s URL. Even if you are able to
get a .com name, you should purchase domain names in other, popular
domains such as .net and .org. That way, you protect your URL from being
“poached” by competitors who are trying to copy you. If your URL is easily
misspelled, consider purchasing a domain name that represents a common
misspelling. That way, if shoppers make a typing error, they’ll still be directed
to your site. 
Provide a convenient payment method
Shoppers go online for many reasons, but those reasons don’t include a desire
for things to be complex and time consuming. No matter how technically
complex it may be to get one’s computer on the Internet, shoppers still want
things to be quick and “seamless.” At the top of the list of seamless processes
is the ability to pay for merchandise purchased online. 
You don’t have to get a merchant account from a bank to process your
own credit card payments. You don’t need to get point-of-sale hardware,
either. The other day, I paid for a heater from a company that sent me to
PayPal’s Web site. PayPal (www.paypal.com) began as an independent 
company, but it became so popular among members of the auction site
eBay that eBay eventually purchased it. Chances are that many of your
prospective customers already have accounts with PayPal if they use 
eBay. I did, so my purchase process was completed in less than a minute.
Set yourself up as a seller with PayPal and BidPay and accept money orders,
personal checks, and cashier’s checks. If you can take the additional step
of getting a shopping cart and a credit card payment system, so much the
better. 
Promote security, privacy, and trust
Even shoppers who have been making purchases online for years at a time still
feel uncertainty when they type their credit card number and click a button
labeled Pay Now, Purchase, or Submit to a commercial Web site. I’m speaking
from personal experience. 
What promotes trust? Information and communication. Shoppers online love
getting information that goes beyond what they can find in a printed catalog.
Be sure to include one or more of the following details that can make shoppers
feel good about pressing your Buy Now button: 
372
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 An endorsement from an organization that is supposed to promote good
business practices, such as TRUSTe (www.truste.org) 
 A privacy statement that explains how you are going to handle customers’
personal information 
 Detailed product descriptions that show you are knowledgeable about a
product 
Another thing that promotes trust is information about who you are and why
you love what you do, as described in the “Blow your own horn” section,
later in this chapter. 
Choose goods and services that buyers want
Every merchant would love to be able to read the minds of his or her prospec-
tive customers. On the Internet, you have as much chance of reading someone’s
mind as you have of meeting that person face to face. Nevertheless, the Internet
does give potential buyers several ways to tell you what they want:
 Come right out and ask them. On your Web site, invite requests for mer-
chandise of one sort or another. 
 After a purchase, ask customers for suggestions of other items you
would like them to buy from you. 
 Visit message boards, newsgroups, and Web sites related to the item you
want to sell. 
 Make a weekly (remember that Saturdays and Sundays are the best days
for auctions to end) search of eBay’s completed auctions to see what
has sold, and which types of items have fetched the highest prices. 
An article called “The art of online merchandising” (techupdate.zdnet.com/
techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2592389-1,00.html) gets highly
technical, but it contains lots of best practices: Decide why you want to sell
something online; identify what constitutes success for your sales efforts; back
your decisions with information; run promotions and launch sales that are
intended to achieve your goals; track the way customers use your site; evalu-
ate what works and what doesn’t, and adjust your sales effort accordingly. 
Have a regular influx of new products
With a printed catalog, changes to sales items can be major. The biggest
problem is the need to physically reprint the catalog when inventory
changes. One of the biggest advantages associated with having an online
373
Chapter 18: Ten Must-Have Features for Your Web Site

sales catalog is the ability to alter your product line in a matter of minutes,
without having to send artwork to a printer. You can easily post new sales
items online each day, as soon as you get new sales figures. 
One reason to keep changing your products on a regular basis is that your
larger competitors are doing so. Lands’ End, which has a well-designed and
popular online sales catalog (www.landsend.com), puts out new products on
a regular basis and announces them in an e-mail newsletter to which loyal
customers can subscribe. 
Be current with upkeep 
and improvements
Do you have a favorite blog, comic strip, or newspaper columnist that you like
to visit each day? I certainly do. If these content providers don’t come up with
a new material on a regular basis, you get discouraged. Your loyal customers
will hopefully feel the same way about your Web site, eBay Store, Amazon
shop, or other sales venue. 
I know what you’re thinking: You’ve got so many things to do that you can’t
possibly be revisiting your Web site every day and changing headings or
putting new sales online. You have to get the kids off to school, pack up some
merchandise, run to the post office, clean up the house — the list goes on
and on. You can’t be two places at once. But two people can. Hire a student
or friend to run your site and suggest new content for you. In a five-minute
phone conversation, you can tell your assistant what to do that day, and you
can go on to the rest of your many responsibilities. 
Personally interact with your customers
The fact that personal touch counts for so much in Internet communication is
a paradox. With rare exceptions, you never meet face to face with the people
with whom you exchange messages. Maybe it’s the lack of body language and
visual clues that make shoppers and other Web surfers so hungry for attention.
But the fact is that impersonal, mass e-mail marketing messages (in other
words, “spam”) are reviled while quick responses with courteous thank-yous
are eagerly welcomed. 
You can’t send too many personal e-mail messages to your customers, even
when they’re only making an inquiry and not a purchase. Not long ago, I asked
some questions about a heater I was thinking of buying online. I filled out the
form on the company’s Web site and submitted my questions. The represen-
tative of the company got right back to me. 
374
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

“First of all, let me thank you for your interest in our product,” the letter began.
She proceeded to answer my questions, and then finished with another thank-
you, and “If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.” I
didn’t hesitate: I asked some more, she answered, and again said “don’t hesi-
tate to ask” at the end. It’s possible this is all “form letter” material, added to
the beginning and end of every inquiry, but it makes a difference. I eventually
purchased the item. Don’t be afraid to pour on the extra courtesy and provide
complete answers to every question: Just tell yourself each answer is worth
an extra dollar or two in sales. It probably is. 
Post advertisements in the right places
When most people think about advertising on the Internet, they automati-
cally think about banner advertisements placed on someone else’s Web page.
This is only one kind of online ad, and possibly the least effective. Make use
of all the advertising options going online brings you, including the following:
 Word of mouth: Bloggers do this all the time: One person mentions some-
thing in another blog, that blogger mentions someone else, and so on. 
 Link exchanges: “You link to my Web site and I’ll link to yours,” in other
words. This is especially effective if you are linking to a business whose
products and services complement your own. 
 Multiple Web sites: If you have three Web sites, you immediately have
two sites linking to each one of yours. Your ability to exchange links with
other Web sites triples, too. 
 Search engines: Make sure that your site is listed in the databases main-
tained by Google and the other search engines (see Chapter 14 for more
information).
Make sure that your home page contains keywords in text and headings that
search engines can use to index it and add it to your database. The more key-
words you add, the better your chances of having your site turn up in search
results. 
Blow your own horn
Sam Walton founded Wal-Mart, and the Walton family still runs it, but 99 percent
of the shoppers who flock to the megastores every day don’t know or care
about that fact. Wal-Mart is a well-established brand with a physical presence.
Your fledgling online business has neither of those advantages. You need to
use your Web site to provide some essential background about you, why you
started your business, and what your goals are. 
375
Chapter 18: Ten Must-Have Features for Your Web Site

Your immediate aim is to answer the question that naturally arises when a
consumer visits your online business: “Who are these people?” or “Who is this
guy (or woman)?” The indirect goal is to answer a question that the shopper
doesn’t necessarily ask consciously, but that is present nonetheless: “Why
should I trust this place?” Be sure to tout your experience, your background,
your family or hobbies — anything to reassure online shoppers that you’re a
reputable person who is looking out for their interests. 
Create a well-organized Web site
This isn’t quite as essential as it used to be, because you can establish a regu-
lar income on eBay without having any Web site at all. But even if you become
a well-established eBay seller, you’re going to want a Web site at some point
or another. How do you make your site well organized? Make sure your site
incorporates these essential features: 
 Navigation buttons: Consumers who are in a hurry (in other words,
almost all consumers) expect to see a row of navigation buttons along
the top or one of the sides of your home page. Don’t make them hunt;
put them there. 
 A site map: A page that leads visitors to all areas of your site can pre-
vent them from going elsewhere if they get lost. 
 Links that actually work: Nothing is more frustrating than clicking on a
link that’s supposed to lead to a photo and/or a bit of information that
you really want and to come up with the generic “Page not found” error
message. 
 Links that indicate where you are on the site: Such links are helpful
because, like a trail of breadcrumbs, they show how the customer got
to a particular page. Here’s an example: 
Clothing > Men’s > Sportswear > Shoes > Running
When your site grows to contain dozens of pages and several main categories,
links that look like this can help people move up to a main category and find
more subcategories. 
Be the first to visit your Web site, and test it to make sure that the forms,
e-mail addresses, and other features function correctly. If someone sends you
and e-mail message only to have it “bounce back,” you’ll probably lose that
customer, who might well conclude that you aren’t monitoring your Web site
or your business. At the very least, open your site in both Microsoft Internet
Explorer and Netscape Navigator (as well as the popular new browser Firefox)
to make sure that your text and images load correctly.

Chapter 19
Ten Hot New Ways to 
Be an Ontrepreneur
N
ot so long ago, starting an online business primarily meant creating a
Web site and organizing it in a businesslike manner. You would create a
catalog, add a shopping cart and payment system, and hope customers would
find you. You might be in an online shopping mall with other online businesses. 
These days, you don’t have to create a full-fledged Web site to sell online. The
hottest ways to make money are to sign up with an online service that helps
individuals get their content online and market themselves or their products
and services before the public. You might have to pay a small monthly host-
ing fee; you might have to pay a sales commission. But the benefits are huge:
You don’t have to do all the work of creating a catalog and payment system
because your host will do the work for you. It might mean signing up with a
company that streamlines the process of setting up an online blog; it might
mean creating a store on eBay or Amazon.com. 
This chapter presents ten innovative approaches to making money online.
By following one or more of these relatively simple options, you can start
generating income quickly and painlessly. You might not make a fortune, but
you focus attention on yourself and your business that can brighten your life
even as it puts some extra cash in your pocket.
Starting a blog
Adding the personal touch has always separated the Mom and Pop stores from
the soulless warehouses. Nowadays, however, you’re likely to be greeted with
a cheery hello even when you wander into a discount mall. So the precedent
has definitely been set for mixing the family into business. With a blog of the
sort described in Chapter 4, you can combine the personal and business areas
of your life into a single Web page. 

The advantage of a blog is that you can give customers a window into your
soul. That can build trust, which in turn, can build business. You might not
want to define yourself with your strong religious preferences or passionate
view on the results of the latest election, but it could be a definite asset to
post a few photos of your children or pets. You might also include a narrative
of your latest family vacation. On a slightly more businesslike side, it would
be really great to have a link to the text of a paper you presented at the latest
professional conference you attended. Of even more relevance might be a
series of photos showing the happy day that the new press was delivered to
your printing plant, accompanied by examples of new brochures that feature
the results of its bells and whistles. Whatever the subject, the goal is to keep
the tone of the text upbeat and breezy, friend to friend.
A woman named Julie Powell decided to methodically work her way through
all the recipes in Julia Child’s classic Mastering the Art of French Cooking.
She started a blog called The Julie/Julia Project (blogs.salon.com/0001399/)
in which she described her attempts to create each dish in the book, chroni-
cling her successes and failures. Because of the popularity of her Web site,
she landed a deal for a real book that, she reports, enabled her to leave her
day job as a secretary. 
Turning your hobby into a business
I’m a perfect example of a person who was able to start a new career thanks
to the Internet. I started when the World Wide Web was new, and lots of folks
who were previously not all that comfortable with the computer were trying
to go online. Nowadays, there’s not such a need for beginner’s books, espe-
cially now that modern babies seem to be born with computer mice in their
hands. So I’m not recommending that you follow in my exact footsteps. But
the point is that you should take anything you love and are good at and turn
it into a Web site. 
I once wrote about a woman named Kim Corbin who loves to skip. She started
a Web site called iSkip.com (www.iskip.com). She now goes around the coun-
try, giving seminars on skipping and inspiring others to improve their mood
and get some exercise by doing the same. The gothic rock star Marilyn Manson
sells his artwork on his Web site (www.marilynmansonartworkonline.com).
One of my favorite online people, a Wisconsin woman who calls herself The
Butter Cow Lady and who has gained local fame through her butter sculptures,
sells her life story on her site (www.thebuttercowlady.com). On the Web,
you’re limited only by your imagination as to what you can sell. Take what
you know and love and run with it.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Getting other people to contribute
Many Web sites work by soliciting contributions from interested visitors. If
you build a Web site, others will come. The most obvious example is eBay:
The site’s success is due almost entirely to content submitted by sellers
around the world. 
You can emulate eBay’s success on a smaller scale. Say you’d like to sell greet-
ing cards. You might post the images of folks who take photographs of scenery,
make block prints of jungle animals, or collect drawings of preschoolers. Or
quilting might be your passion. Why not set up a Web site that offers the work
of those who create different patterns, use different fabrics, collect antique
quilts, or do repair? The Web is the perfect place to bring like-minded individ-
uals together, and contributions from others can keep your site current and
successful while giving you time to focus on design and marketing issues. 
Sites like PoetsPassion.com (www.poetspassion.com) solicit poems from
artists on many different topics, and they display ads provided by Google.
Slashdot (slashdot.org), a popular news-and-views site for computer nerds,
depends on those very same nerds for many of its stories and reviews, and
gains credibility for welcome opinions from far and wide. 
Inspiring others with your thoughts
Sometimes, you end up making a huge change in your life without really trying.
You put something online that’s sincere, heartfelt, and that you think might
help some other people. You find out that there are tons of people out there
who feel the same way. 
I am reminded of the story of Reata Strickland, a Webmaster and Sunday school
teacher in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. She was touched by a short story called
“Interview with God.” She spent a couple of days turning the story into a Web
page presentation. She put the pages online, felt good that she had done so,
and moved on to other things. In the meantime, the site took on a life of its
own. Reata was soon notified by her church’s Internet Service Provider that
her site had attracted 500,000 visitors. Before long, the site was getting two
million visitors a month. Reata has since made herself into a marketable per-
sonality, giving talks, creating new presentations, and selling merchandise
related to the short story “Interview with God” and similar products. She also
wrote a 64-page book called Interview with God. It was all unplanned, but she
embraced her success and made the most of it: You can, too. 
You’ll find the original Interview with God presentation and more about Reata
Strickland at Moments with God (www.momentswithgod.com).

Offering your services on eLance
If you say the phrase “making money online,” what would come to the minds
of most people is selling small, easily transportable objects. But merchandise
is only one type of product you can make available in the marketplace; you
can also market your services and your knowledge. Put out an ad on your
local version of Craigslist (www.craigslist.org). Then register with eLance
(www.elanceonline.com) as a professional contractor.
Simply purchasing a domain name for your Web site and then creating a simple
one-page advertisement that points people to your offices and explains your
qualifications will help. Check out e-commerce attorney David Adler’s page
(www.ecommerceattorney.com).
Opening the PayPal tip jar
Chapter 9 addressed several different ways to make money with the help of
the biggest of all online booksellers, Amazon.com, including Amazon’s tip jar
feature. PayPal has its own tip jar button, and you can add it to your blog or
Web site in an effort to solicit donations from faithful visitors who find value
in what you do. 
First, you need to apply for a PayPal account if you don’t have one already by
going to the PayPal home page (www.paypal.com) and clicking Sign Up Now.
It’s free to obtain an account and to set up the Tip Jar service. Go to the Pay-
Pal - Directory of Features page (www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?
cmd=p/mer/directory_intro) and click Get Started in the row labeled
Donations. Follow the steps on subsequent screens to set up the button,
which enables individuals to send payments to your PayPal account. 
Giving out not-so-free advice
The Internet has always been a great place to get questions answered. Over the
years, the newsgroups that populate Usenet have been the primary resources
for answers and support. You can also start a Web site on which you offer your
consulting services. If you know something about computers or the repair and
maintenance of other objects, you can answer questions and earn a few bucks
on the Google Answers site (answers.google.com). At the time this was writ-
ten, the program had all the Researchers (registered question answerers) it
needed, but predicted that more would be hired in the near future; check back
to see if you can join the team. You can also gather tips, tricks, and instructions
pertaining to your field of interest: Rod Stephens does just that on his VB Helper
site (www.vb-helper.com) where he gathers information on the programming
language Visual Basic. He also solicits donations via the Amazon.com tip jar
(see the preceding section). 
380
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Turning to your pets for help
I’m not kidding. As an online businessperson, you are looking for something
you are passionately interested in and that other people love just as much.
Practically everybody has a pet of some sort that they love. Pets, pet care,
and related products and services abound on the Web. If you breed pets, you
can start up a Web site and take orders; you can create pet toys and sell them
online; if you’re a photographer, you can take photos of pets; if you’re a Web
site designer, you can create Web sites for pampered pets that describes
training. Just think about the animals you love and that live close to you,
and you’re bound to come up with some ideas that will have them and their
owners eating out of your hand. 
Becoming a storehouse of information
What’s that you say? You don’t have a pet, you can’t draw, you don’t have any
products to sell, and you aren’t a professional contractor. Never fear. On the
Web, information sells. Chances are you have a storehouse of information
about one topic in particular. You know a lot about your family history, you
know everything there is to know about collecting coins, you are a genius
with identifying rocks, or you are an avid birdwatcher. Create a Web site in
which you put every bit of information you have online. Make your site the one
and only, all greatest resource ever devoted to this topic. Follow the example
of the Urban Legend Reference Pages (www.snopes.com), a Web site started
back in 1995 by a husband-and-wife team living in California. The site collects
urban legends of all sorts and reports on whether or not they’re actually true;
it makes enough money from ads to keep it going. But the main thing is that
it’s a labor of love for its creators. 
Need income? Just ask!
It sounds odd, but if you present yourself in the right way on the Web, and you
simply ask for money, you just might get it. The most famous case is that of
Karyn Bosnak. When she found herself buried in $20,000 of credit card debt,
she created a Web site called SaveKaryn.com (www.savekaryn.com). She
asked for donations to help her out of debt. In just 20 weeks, her site received
nearly two million visits, and she wasn’t in debt anymore — especially since
her book Save Karyn was published in several languages, too. 
When blogger Andrew Sullivan was in need of funds to keep his blog online,
faithful readers donated more than $70,000. Sullivan was well established by
that time; people knew he would use the money to keep providing them with
the opinions and insights they were used to. Present yourself in an open, pos-
itive manner, and readers will respond to you, too. 
381
Chapter 19: Ten Hot New Ways to Be an Ontrepreneur

Be advised that the field of virtual panhandling is already very crowded.
Just check the Google directory at directory.google.com/Top/Society/
People/Requesting_Help/Debt_Reduction. These folks have created Web
sites seeking donations so they can get out of debt. You’ll have to find a way
to distinguish yourself from the crowd if you want attention for your financial
needs. 
Expanding your existing 
business to the Web
Expanding your business to the Web isn’t new, of course. But a surprising
number of established businesspeople haven’t done it yet. Many of the
lawyers I know have no idea what to do with the Web. The same goes for
other service providers, such from dentists to plumbers to auto mechanics.
It can be as simple as listing a fee chart, your hours, and where to park when
customers come to your facility. Or you can expand a bit to include references
from satisfied customers. 
The point is that these days a large percentage of the population is sitting at
the computer already hooked up to the Internet. When they suddenly realize
that they need their suit pressed for a meeting the next day or that their kids
need school supplies, they are more likely to call up information on service
providers by using a search engine than they are to flip through the phone
book and make a call to find out locations and hours.
