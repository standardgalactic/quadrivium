 
Lab: SQL Injection 
Purpose 
In this lab, we are going to demonstrate how an SQL injection is executed on a vulnerable website. 
You will also be required to carry out some SQL injection exercises. 
 
SQL Injection Using Input Fields 
1. Login to the Kali Linux VM (user: kali, password: kali) 
2. Open the browser and open the URL: localhost/sqli-basic 
 
 
 
3. See the results for a legitimate user (user: Jack, password: 123): 
 
 
          
 

 
  
 
 
 
4. Create a malicious SQL query using the following strings in username and password fields: 
 
 
 
The results show that the malicious SQL query executed successfully and as a result, all the records 
in the Users table are displayed on the screen: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
5. You can craft a malicious SQL query by using blank for the last part of the query 
 
 
SQL Injection By Modifying URL using OR Operator 
1. Open the browser and open the URL: localhost/sqli-union and select Song ID ‘1’: 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 
 
 
The results show details of the selected song: 
 
 
 
 
2. Craft the malicious SQL query by inserting it directly in the URL: 
localhost/sqli-union/sql-union.php?id=1’ OR ‘1’=’1 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
The results show details of the selected song: 
 
 
 
SQL Injection By Modifying URL using UNION Operator 
1. You can also craft the malicious SQL query by using the UNION operator: 
      localhost/sqli-union/sql-union.php?id=1’ UNION SELECT * FROM Users WHERE ‘1’=’1 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
The UNION operator basically joins two queries into one and as the results show, we 
get results both for the Songs table as well as a listing of all the records in the User 
table. The formatting is not aligned because we are actually seeing two different types 
of output: 
 
 
 
 
Task:  
- Craft a malicious SQL query which displays all the Songs in the Songs table, but you must: 
o Insert SQL injection directly in the URL AND 
o Use only the Union Operator 
 
(Solution on Next Page) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Solution:  
- You should first select any song e.g., ID=’1’ from the dropdown menu to the correct URL to 
modify and then insert the injection in the URL as follows: 
 
    localhost/sqli-union/sql-union.php?id=1’ UNION SELECT * FROM Songs WHERE ‘1’=’1 
 
     OR 
 
     localhost/sqli-union/sql-union.php?id=1’ UNION SELECT * FROM Songs WHERE ‘’=’
