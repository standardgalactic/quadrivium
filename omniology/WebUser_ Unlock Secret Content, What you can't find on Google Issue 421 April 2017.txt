ASA’s new online library offers
a vast cosmic collection of
140,000 images, videos and
audio clips from the last 100 years.
This means you can view and
download stunning copyright-free
photos of Saturn and Mars, see Neil
Armstrong on the Moon and take a
peek at space launches, the Milky Way
and phenomena such as the Northern
Lights and solar ﬂares.
From the homepage, you can check
out the latest uploads and browse
the most popular images and videos.
If you want to download the files,
there’s a variety of resolutions on
offer and NASA says you can freely
embed them in your own websites
and projects. There are also filters to
help you narrow down your searches
by year and content type, while the
list view provides a description and
creation date for each result.
NASA has clearly put a lot of time
and effort into the site, right down to

originally made for the NES console and now free to play
online within a Flash-enabled browser. You help Dizzy
gather objects to solve puzzles while avoiding obstacles
and collecting stars. Use the cursor keys to move left, right

has revolutionised long

can do the same in
Windows 10. Netflix is
allowing certain movies

app for Windows 10, which means
you can watch content anywhere
without an internet connection. You
can also choose between standard-
and high-quality video. You’ll find downloadable content by
heading for the hamburger menu at the top of the app, and
anything you save will be stored in My Downloads. The app
costs 79p, on top of your Netflix subscription. Neflix has
also changed how you rate shows and films, ditching the
star-ratings for a thumbs-up and thumbs-down system.

We pick the 10 best things you must do on the web this fortnight

Need to Know
8 19 April - 2 May 2017
What happened?
Microsoft has finally revealed exactly
what sort of data it collects from
Windows 10 users, via documentation
for its latest big upgrade to the
operating system, the Creators Update.
The software giant has been criticised
for harvesting too much user data from
Windows 10 and is now making clear
exactly what it collects. Microsoft says it
uses the data to improve services, tailor
products to its users and keep Windows
secure and operating properly.
In previous versions of Windows,
users had to opt in to allow collection of
telemetry data, so details of your PC
activities weren’t necessarily sent to
Microsoft. In Windows 10, the data is
collected automatically with no way of
disabling it unless you use the
Enterprise edition. This intrusive
behaviour annoyed privacy advocates,
as well as many users who prefer to be
able to choose what data Microsoft
does and doesn’t get from them.
The Creators Update gives some
power back to users by letting them
control certain privacy settings, and
Microsoft has provided more detail
about what it’s been collecting. This
includes details of your operating
system build and location; your
Microsoft Account and Xbox user ID;
the apps you’re using; your IP address;
and your PC’s specifications, such as
available memory and storage.
Microsoft also collects data about
how you use apps, what you pin to the
taskbar and any errors or crashes. This
is fairly detailed, and includes how long
some interactions take, how you type
on your keyboard or touchscreen and
whether the user is known to be a child.
Microsoft also said it would extend its
online privacy dashboard to include
details about the voice data it collects
through the Cortana voice assistant.
How will it affect you?
The Creators Update launched on
11 April and, depending on how your
version of Windows is set up, it will
download automatically and install
shortly after. To avoid overloading
Microsoft’s servers, not everyone will
get the update immediately. Waiting to
install has its benefits, too, because it
means you’ll avoid the first round of
problems, such as software bugs.
During installation, the Creators
Update presents a choice of privacy
settings, so make sure you consider the
options. The settings on offer concern
location, speech-recognition data and
diagnostics, as well as “tailored
experiences” such as recommendations
for products and services, and “relevant
ads” (which we covered in Issue 419’s
cover feature). Microsoft also explains
exactly what each setting means, so
read the full descriptions where
available. You should be able to make
changes after installation, too.
What do we think?
Many Windows users probably don’t
worry about the data Microsoft collects
about them, but it’s time Microsoft
answered complaints from those who
do. Privacy-minded people aren’t
irrational, and Microsoft should know
better than to treat its customers’
information as its own property.
By explaining how it uses the data it
collects, Microsoft hopes to assuage
concerns that users are being spied on,
which is good news for Microsoft’s
engineers. Telemetry data helps
Microsoft spot when users have a
problem with a feature, a driver or a
crashing PC. When Microsoft identifies
problems, it can fix them – otherwise it
has to rely on users making sufficiently
detailed reports, which can mean minor
problems go unnoticed.
To support its case that it uses data
responsibly, Microsoft pointed out that
it stopped collecting certain types of
data after realising it wasn’t useful.
It’s a pity that Windows users had to get
up in arms over the company’s data
collection before Microsoft came to
its senses, but better privacy is certainly
a welcome addition to the Creators
Update.

Need to Know
What happened?
Amazon has banned the
sale of set-top boxes with
Kodi installed in a bid
to discourage people
from using the popular
streaming software for
piracy. The company’s
updated policy on
streaming-media players
states that people who sell
through the site shouldn’t
offer products that help
others infringe copyright.
The policy reads:
“If you sell these products,
we may immediately
suspend or terminate your
selling privileges and
destroy inventory in our
fulfilment centres
without reimbursement.
In addition, if we determine
that your account has been
used to engage in fraud
or other illegal activity,
remittances and payments
may be withheld or
forfeited.”
While Kodi itself isn’t
illegal, third-party add-ons
can be used to find and
stream pirated content
online. The government’s
Intellectual Property Office
is considering banning the
software, and people have
Amazon bans all
preloaded Kodi boxes
been arrested for selling
boxes with the system
installed on them.
How will it affect you?
Kodi-equipped TV boxes
were still for sale on
Amazon at the time of
writing, but you should
expect them to become
harder to find. Even if you
can’t buy a box pre-loaded
with Kodi, it’s possible to
install the system on other
devices, as we’ll explain in
next issue’s cover feature.
Amazon’s ban may make it
harder to buy a Kodi-
equipped box, but Kodi
is still available to use.
What do we think?
The authorities must
decide where they stand
on Kodi, rather than
leaving it to retailers.
If Kodi is deemed illegal,
online stores such as
Amazon will stop selling
boxes offering the
software. But if it’s not
illegal, there’s no reason
why Amazon shouldn’t
stock them. Hopefully,
the IPO will make
a quick decision.
That said, Kodi
users should
understand why
such efforts are
being made: many
streams provided
by third-party
add-ons offer free
shows and movies
that have been
pirated. Like other
sources of pirated
material, such as
torrent sites, they
will be shut down
eventually.
What happened?
Google’s answer to the
Amazon Echo and Alexa
voice assistant has arrived
in the UK. Like Amazon’s
device, which launched last
year, Google Home is a
speaker with a built-in
voice assistant that lets
you ask questions, perform
basic tasks using your
smart-home accessories
and more.
As well as Home, Google
launched Wifi, a router
priced at £129 that has
a few interesting tricks
up its sleeve. Multiple Wifi
routers can work together
to create a mesh network
that provides better Wi-Fi
coverage throughout your
home. It’s like installing
Wi-Fi extenders but
without the effort.
How will it affect you?
Google Home costs £129,
which is £21 less than the
Amazon Echo, although
Amazon’s Echo Dot – a
smaller version that you
connect to your own
speaker – costs just £50,
and remains the cheapest
way to equip your home
with a digital assistant.
For a further £18 to £36,
you can personalise your
Home with a fabric or
Google Home and
Wifi arrive in the UK
metal base, but we find this
a bit pointless.
What do we think?
It’s interesting to see
Google launch its own
router, but it remains to be
seen how successful it is.
Routers are often
complicated to use,
and can result in a slower
connection than the speed
your broadband supports.
Google Wifi’s networking
tools should fix that.
Google Home may be a
tougher sell, because many
people who were intrigued
by the prospect of a digital
assistant will surely have
shelled out for Amazon’s
version by now. Voice
assistants are certainly
handy in many ways – you
can ask them to play music,
answer questions and set
reminders without having
to pull out your phone.
But before you spend your
hard-earned pounds on
a fancy speaker, it’s a good
idea to try one out in a
shop. If you run out of
things to ask Home or Echo
after a few minutes, you
may not find it as useful
as you thought.
We’ll take a closer look
at Google Home and Wifi
in our next issue.

Need to Know
FIRST LOOK
10 19 April - 2 May 2017
Apple iPad (2017)
bit.ly/ipad421
Apple’s latest 9.7in iPad, which has
dropped ‘Air’ from its name, is priced
to tempt, with its smallest capacity
Wi-Fi-only model (32GB) costing just
£339. Despite the low price, Apple
hasn’t simply taken an existing
model and made it cheaper; it’s
a significant upgrade over the
iPad Air 2 in many ways. However,
there are also some well-chosen
compromises that have allowed Apple
to keep the price down. For example,
the iPad doesn’t use the A9X chip
seen in the iPad Pro series, but
instead uses the A9 chip featured in
the iPhone 6S. That doesn’t mean
it’s slow – with the exception of the
pricier iPad Pros, this is easily the
fastest iPad Apple has ever made.
One area where Apple has definitely
not compromised is the battery.
The new iPad has the best battery life
we’ve seen on any recent tablet,
including devices running Android.
Apple quotes a 10-hour battery life,
but our standard battery test
delivered 14hrs 47mins of use, which,
compared with 9hrs 32mins on the
iPad Air 2 and 12hrs 9mins on the
Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, is fabulous.
In conclusion, Apple has managed
to come up with an exceptionally
good tablet at a price that’s only
a little higher than comparable
Android devices. With those devices,
however, you wouldn’t be getting
access to the best tablet-app library
there is, along with excellent
performance and a record-breaking
battery life. The new iPad is a
compromise, but it’s a brilliant one.
What happened?
Android has replaced Windows as the
world’s most popular operating system,
according to research carried out by
web-analytics company StatCounter
(bit.ly/stat421).
In March 2017, Android marginally
took the lead of the worldwide
OS-usage market share, with 37.93%
of web users accessing the internet
via Google’s operating system, and
Windows close behind at 37.91%. This
covers total usage across desktop,
laptop, tablet and mobile combined.
Aodhan Cullen, CEO of StatCounter,
declared the figures represented
“a milestone in technology history and
the end of an era”. He added that it
“marks the end of Microsoft’s leadership
worldwide of the OS market, which it has
held since the Eighties. It also represents
a major breakthrough for Android,
which held just 2.4% of global internet
usage share only five years ago.”
Cullen suggested that the reasons for
the breakthrough were the growth of
smartphones to access the internet,
a decline in sales of traditional PCs and
the impact of Asia on the global market.
Despite this, Windows still dominates
the worldwide operating-system market
on PCs and laptops, because it held
84.34% of the usage share as of March.
What’s more, despite Android’s
combined platform victory, Windows
Android usurps Windows as most popular OS
is still dominating usage in Europe –
with 51.7% market share versus
Android’s 23.6%. The story is very
different in Asia, where Android leads
with 52.2% market share, significantly
overshadowing Windows’ 29.2%.
How will it affect you?
If you’ve got an Android phone or
tablet, you can now feel satisfied that
you’re using the most popular operating
system in the world; and if you haven’t,
perhaps it’s time to join the revolution.
Interestingly, iOS can only claim a 13%
usage share – just over a third of its
mobile rival – but Apple fans would
no doubt point out that most iOS users
are running the same, most up-to-date
version of the operating system. On an
Android device, you could be running
anything from Ice Cream Sandwich
(v4.0) to the latest release, Nougat.
What do we think?
We’re not surprised that Android has
overtaken Windows in popularity –
if only by a small percentage share.
The low cost of Android devices makes
them the obvious choice for anyone
buying a smartphone or a web-
connected device of any kind, especially
in developing countries where Windows
laptops and PCs remain expensive.
We fully expect Android’s market
share to continue growing as Windows
keeps shrinking.
The new screen’s colours are vivid,
and it has a sharp 2,048 x 1,563
resolution, but there’s a noticeable air
gap between the surface of the display
and the LCD beneath it (although you’d
only notice if you’ve used the iPad Pro).
The iPad is a little thicker and heavier
than the iPad Air 2 but again, it’s
unlikely you’ll notice the difference.

Kniterate
bit.ly/knit421 | From $4,699 (£3,764)
This ingenious device takes the concept of 3D modelling
and applies it to knitting. Design a garment using the
supplied software, either from scratch or using a template,
and the machine will knit it for you using its clever system of yarn feeders, rollers
and needles (we’re not quite sure how it works, to be honest). You can use up to
six different colours and materials in each item, and share the results with the
Kniterate community. Sure, it’s expensive, but it’s still cheaper – and more fun! –
than industrial knitting machines that cost tens of thousands of pounds.
A tweet has

AOL CEO Tim

announced the
name on Twitter,
saying the two

and a billion consumers, as well as
hinting that the launch would happen
this summer. A Twitter account for Oath
has also been created.
The US telecoms company Verizon
acquired AOL for $4.4bn (£3.5bn) in
2015, gaining ownership of sites such as
Engadget, The Huffington Post and
TechCrunch, and will soon own Yahoo’s
Tumblr and Flickr businesses.
The Oath division will be formed once
Verizon closes the $4.83bn (£3.89bn)
acquisition of Yahoo. The deal was
reduced by $350m (£281m) after two
cyber-attacks came to light in which
a billion customer accounts were
compromised in 2013 and another
500 million in 2014.
With this new Oath conglomerate,
Verizon also appears to be taking on
Google’s parent company, Alphabet, by

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
David Emm, principal
security researcher
at Kaspersky Lab
(www.kaspersky.co.uk)
Q
Is it safe to
connect third-
party apps
to my Twitter account?
Mark Rush, Twitter
A
Yes and no.
Although third-
party apps provide
useful and necessary
services, they could also
involve you signing over
full control of your account
to someone else. The
45% of UK companies hit
by ransomware
Almost half
of large UK
businesses have
suffered a
ransomware
attack in the past
year, with nearly
one third fearing
that, although the problem has been
resolved, the criminals may still be
lurking in their systems. Security
company Citrix surveyed 500
UK-based IT managers in companies
with 250 or more employees and
found that 45% had fallen victim to
a successful ransomware attack.
Despite this high figure, the research
also found that 11% of businesses
this size don’t have a formal
ransomware policy in place.
Knowing how to deal with
a ransomware infection has become
recent Twitter hack, whereby
users of the third-party app
Twitter Counter had their
accounts compromised with
messages from political
activists (bit.ly/counter421),
shows how vigilant you need
to be not only about your
own security practices but
also those of the tools you
use. The hack was a clear
example of when a third-
party app’s weakness not
only affected the app itself,
but also Twitter and
thousands of its users.
If you believe your Twitter
account has been affected,
you should change your
password immediately.
However, it is also critical to
understand the permissions
you agree to when installing
apps. Kaspersky research
recently found that 63% of
consumers neglect to read
the licence agreement
carefully before installing
a new app on their phone,
and one in five (20%) never
read these messages when
installing apps. This means an
alarming number of people
are leaving their privacy – and
the data on their phones –
exposed to cyber threats due
to poor safety practices.
To protect yourself, you
should:
• Only download apps from
trusted sources
• Be wise in selecting apps
to install on your device
• Read the licence
agreement carefully
during the installation
process
• Read the list of
permissions an app
is requesting. Do not
simply click ‘Next’ during
installation without
checking what you are
agreeing to
• Use security software
that will protect your
device from cyber threats

“A lot of this is about isolating
a potentially infected machine, deciding
whether you’re going to pay the ransom
or not – there’s a business choice to be
made there – and then being able to
build confidence that you have actually
dealt with the ransomware attack and
it isn’t still lurking,” said Chris Mayers,

Fake airline tickets trick 90%
of phishing targets
Phishing attacks designed to look like
airline tickets catch out as many as 90%
of their intended victims, according to
Barracuda Networks. The security firm
uncovered the specialist spin on standard
phishing emails in its usual scans of
customers’ emails.
“We’ve seen this attack with several of
our customers, especially in industries
that deal with frequent shipping of
goods or employee travel, such as
logistics, shipping and manufacturing,”
noted Asaf Cidon, vice president of
content security services, in a blog
post. “Our analysis shows that for the
airline phishing attack, attackers are
successful over 90% of the time in
getting employees to open airline
impersonation emails,” he added,
though targets need to open the
attachment or click embedded links to
be infected. “This is one of the highest
success rates for phishing attacks.”

Kodi
www.kodi.tv
Kodi’s old website was quite technical
and even a little intimidating, but not any
more. Now far friendlier in its approach,
it clearly explains what Kodi can achieve
and how you can make the most of the
software. To this end, the techy stuff has
been tucked firmly away in the news
section, and the download page is far
less wordy and confusing. Kodi has also
overhauled its Add-ons page, making
it searchable and supplementing the
categories with suggested apps. The
result is a much more user-friendly
offering that, combined with the
helpful forum and informative wiki,
should win Kodi lots of new fans.
Google Open Source
opensource.google.com
This site brings together all the free,
open-source projects Google has created
over the years. You can discover what
they do, learn how Google uses them
and grab the source code for yourself
(assuming you’re a dab hand at software
development). As you’d expect from
Google, searching for the projects is
quick and easy – there are two list views
and a drop-down search menu packed
with categories. You’ll also find lots of
documents, information about hosting
an open-source event and details of
student programs and contests. Be sure
to check out the blog, too.

StartPage
www.startpage.com
StartPage is a long-running search engine that combines results drawn from Google

leaving a trace, you can set it to automatically highlight your search words on the
page when you click through. Welcome additions include better image searching,
which lets you fine-tune results using size, colour and type filters; and a new Instant
Answers feature, where you can type questions to get answers within the search
results. Best of all, because no user data is collected, the results are unfiltered so you
get the full web and not just what Google wants you to see.

Keep Bears Wild
keepbearswild.org
Yogi Bear may have loved stealing picnic
baskets, but ursine access to human food
is a big no-no in real life. You can learn
why at this rich resource from officials
at Yosemite National Park, California. As
well as photos and videos, there’s lots of
information about bears, their habits and
threats, as well as an in-depth blog about
the latest conservation efforts. Best of all,
Yosemite’s online bear tracker uses data
from GPS collars to show each animal’s
location and how many miles it has
travelled. The map offers case studies of
bears, too, including details of how many
have been hit by vehicles since 1995.

redesigned to include both the total

Amazon is hoping to capture a major

with VAT-exclusive and discount pricing.
It offers the same free one-day delivery
that Amazon Prime members enjoy, as
well as a business-analytics tool to help
you track and monitor your spending.
You can add multiple users to accounts
and set spending limits to ensure no one
goes over budget. Amazon says it has
100 million items available for small,
medium and large companies to buy,
and the service has already proved very
popular in the US and Germany.
Visit Ramsgate
www.visitramsgate.co.uk
This well-presented, easily navigable
website does a decent job of selling the
southern seaside town of Ramsgate.
As well as emphasising its place as the
UK’s only Royal Harbour, it offers an
interesting look at the area’s history, with
lovely photos taken by local snappers.
The site contains everything you need
to get a flavour of Ramsgate, with lists of
restaurants, a detailed overview of things
to do and a page of travel info. But while
we like its use of Google Calendar to
display events, which makes it easy
to copy items to your own calendar,
there are too few suggested places
to stay and the blog is rather sparse.

you can download, a fun gallery and lots of information for visitors, including details
of its busiest periods. Buying tickets is also much easier than before, thanks to the

Firefox gets CSS Grid
The latest version of Firefox
introduces support for the CSS
Grid system. This makes laying out
web pages with CSS even easier,
using simple mark-up that’s similar
to creating basic HTML tables. It’s
currently only supported in
Firefox and Chrome, with Safari
coming soon (it’s already in
preview versions), and only works
on PC browsers, so it won’t help
you lay out a site for mobile users
just yet. It’s being hailed as the
future of web layout, though, so
it’s worth getting up to speed. You
can read more about Grid at bit

guide, try bit.ly/guide421.

Making changes to your website
is a risk because even if you prefer
a new layout or design, it doesn’t
mean your visitors will. Google’s
new way to test different versions
of your site is Optimize (optimize

excellent Analytics, there are only
a few steps to go through before
you can test elements – such as

Q
What’s the best way to protect

Richard Fisher, via email
A
Website security is a complex issue
involving all kinds of factors
including the kind of website you
have, the passwords you use and, of course,
the reliability of your web host. In order
to ensure your website is secure, you’ll need
to take some simple – but crucial – security
measures.
It’s vital that you continuously update
online programs, regularly change
passwords and install the latest security
products. Software updates usually include
crucial security fixes, so if you don’t install
the latest versions of all software, platforms
and plugins, you increase the chances of
a security breach.

20 19 April - 2 May 2017
B
ack in October 2016 (Issue 407, bit.ly/
webuser407) we tested a selection of laptops
that cost less than £200. These are great if
you’re on a tight budget but they make compromises
in design and performance to keep costs down.
If you’re happy to spend more, you’ll get more bang
for your buck with one of these mid-range laptops.
With newer, faster processors, better designed
cases and larger screens, the laptops in this round-up
will give your computing a significant and noticeable
power boost.
The slim, tasteful design of Asus’s ZenBook calls
to mind Apple’s MacBook Air, but with more
palatable pricing. The resemblance isn’t purely
aesthetic, either, because this model is also
a lightweight travelling companion rather than
a desktop replacement.
Unlike most of the other laptops in this test, the
UX310UA comes with a dual-core i3 processor,
which limits its multitasking capabilities, pushing
its performance to third place in our Windows
benchmark tests. It also came joint-third in the
gaming benchmark, running Dirt
Showdown at a playable 29fps (frames
per second), outperformed by the Acer
and PC Specialist laptops. The
specification of its other components
is also a bit light: it only comes with
4GB of memory and a small 128GB
SSD (solid-state drive).
Despite these limitations, the
ZenBook still comes top of the group.
Some of this success can be
attributed to its screen.
Its maximum
brightness of
341cd/m2
(candles per square
metre) isn’t quite the
brightest in this round-up but its
superb contrast ratio of 1,282:1 lifts it
well above its rivals. Its 13.3in panel
offers a Full HD resolution of 1,920
by 1,080 pixels, giving it a sharp
pixel density of 165ppi (pixels per
inch). It’s not a touchscreen but it’s
by far the best-looking in this group.
Connectivity is good, with 802.11ac wireless
and Bluetooth 4.1. There’s a decent collection
of USB ports (one USB 3, two USB 2 and a USB
Type-C), a keyboard that has a great feel to it
and a spacious touchpad that doesn’t
leave you feeling
constrained.
The final feather
in the ZenBook’s
cap is its battery
life. It delivered
8 hours and 6
minutes of video
playback in our
looping video test,
which was second to
the Transformer Mini,
but is no less impressive
because it doesn’t have
the Tranformer’s low-
powered, performance-
hampering Atom processor.

HOW WE TESTED
Although it’s not the
best-performing laptop
in this group, we were
impressed with the
balance between the
ZenBook’s performance
and price, and love that
Asus has decided to
include a top-quality
screen, keyboard and
touchpad, rather than cut
corners to trim the price.
It’s these things, after all,
that make a computer a
pleasure to work on.
It also has a healthy
battery life that should get
you through a working
day and it’s very portable,
being only 18mm thick
and weighing 1.35kg.

19 April - 2 May 2017 21
Dell’s Vostro range is aimed at businesses
rather than home users, but if you spend
more time using word processors and
spreadsheets than gaming, you might
appreciate that your money is
buying a practical machine
with nothing wasted on
entertainment-focused fripperies.
It comes with Windows 10 Pro installed,
and an Intel i5-7200 processor, paired with 8GB of memory
and a 256GB SSD. This combination of components pushed
it to the top of the group’s Windows benchmarks with an
overall score of 48.
The battery life was disappointing, lasting 5 hours and 40
minutes in our looping video test. We also weren’t enamoured
with the screen, which is a good size (14in) but doesn’t have
the resolution to back it up: its 1,366 x 768 pixels display only
provides 111ppi (pixels per inch). It’s not bright, either, with a
maximum brightness of 210cd/m2 and a contrast ratio of 264:1.
Acer’s Spin 3 has the group’s lowest price and
the largest (15.6in) screen, which can flip to
convert into an oversized tablet.
However, its 1,366 x 768 pixels ended
up looking blocky because they are
spread so thin. It’s also heavy, weighing
2.14kg, which is particularly hefty for a tablet. Its internal
specifications are disappointing, as our Windows performance
tests showed (though it was still faster than the Transformer
Mini), but it surprised us by giving the best gaming
performance in the test, running Dirt Showdown at 37fps.
The smallest device in this test, the
Transformer Mini is a tablet that converts
into a laptop using a clip-on keyboard.
This, plus its lighter weight (790g
with the keyboard attatched, 530g
without) makes it easier to hold in tablet
form than the Acer Spin 3. Its screen is bright
and clear, even outdoors, and its 12 hours and 13 minutes of
battery life will keep it going while you’re on the move.
However, its compact size leaves room for only two ports and
a small low-resolution touchscreen of 1,280 x 800 pixels. Its
Atom processor placed it last in our performance tests, too.
The other laptops reviewed here are
mass-produced, but PC Specialist
assembles its laptops to order, so you
can tweak the components. This pays
off because although the
UltraNote is more expensive
than our other award winners,
it’s very well equipped.
An Intel Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of
memory and a 256GB SSD would be impressive enough, but it
also has a 1TB mechanical hard drive installed. It wasn’t quite
as fast in our Windows tests as the Siver Award-winning Dell
Vostro, but it performed well in our games, coming a close
second to the Acer Spin 3. Its full HD screen isn’t as good as
that of the Asus ZenBook, but it’s a step up from the Vostro’s.
However, it’s not all plain sailing. The UltraNote’s battery
only lasted 5 hours and 31 minutes in our test, and the chunky
case, which is thicker than any of the other laptops in this test,
makes it less portable.

With a sharper and more vibrant screen, the Vostro could have taken our Gold
Award, but it’s let down by a low resolution and lacklustre brightness. However,
it runs Windows better than the ZenBook.
This is a great all-round laptop, almost as powerful as the Dell Vostro at running
Windows but with a better screen for entertainment. Its bulky case means it’s
not so good for travelling, though, and it has a limited battery life.

OUR VERDICT
It failed to come top in our performance tests, but we were
happy with the Asus ZenBook UX310UA’s balance between
power and price, so we gave it our Gold Award. Asus hasn’t
cut back on the quality of design, either, and the laptop feels
luxurious to work on, with a bright screen and spacious
keyboard and touchpad.
For more power, you could opt for the Silver Award-winning
Dell Vostro 5468, which pushes all its effort into Windows
performance. There’s some compromise, though, with a
lacklustre low-resolution screen and mediocre battery life.
The Bronze Award-winning PC Specialist UltraNote IV 14
manages to bring a better screen and improved performance
to a single package, but it’s significantly more expensive,
costing almost £70 more than both our Gold and Silver
award winners.

TP-Link RE450
£44.99 from bit.ly/tpl414
Tested: Issue 414
The TP-Link RE450 provides a strong signal at
a price that’s hard to resist. It’s better at extending

Tested: Issue 409

The Cloudbook 14 is as good a laptop as you’ll get for less

brilliant display, but it’s fantastic value, especially because
it includes a year’s subscription to Office 365 Personal.

Bandizip is a superfast, easy-to-use
compression tool that supports all the main file
formats, including ZIP, 7Z and RAR. It offers
a good selection of features, including the
ability to create self-extracting archives, split
ZIPs across volumes and encrypt files. The
latest new-look version sports a new installer
and console program, and offers faster
extracting and compressing. Bandizip can also
now open and extract files from archives in the
ZPAQ and LZIP compression formats.
There are installer and portable versions
available but as with a growing number of
products, it no longer works on systems running
Windows XP.
Even if you have a sizeable hard drive, it can
soon begin to fill up with large programs and
media files. If you’ve ever wondered where
all that free space on your hard drive has
vanished to, or which files are taking up the
most room, the excellent TreeSize Free can
tell you.
This new release introduces the hierarchical
treemap chart that was previously only
available in the Pro edition. This makes it
easier to visualise data distribution across
your system. The program has also had
a makeover, and now sports a ribbon
interface and a touch-friendly design. It will
display better on high DPI screens, too.
There’s no shortage of tools you can use to
trim, crop, merge and convert your videos.
HD Video Converter Factory is another such
program, and is actually a cut-down version of
a paid-for product. This means there are some
limitations to be aware of – not all the export
formats are available, you’re limited to 720p
resolution conversions, and it’s a bit slower
– but it still has plenty to keep you happy.
To use HD Video Converter Factory,
you just drag a video file to the program’s
interface, make the desired changes using
the Clip, Crop and/or Effects tools, pick an
output format and click Run.

Get more options for
closing tabs
Google recently announced plans to
drop two little-used options from the
tab right-click menu: ‘Close other tabs’
and ‘Close tabs to the right’. If you’d
prefer to keep these options, as well as
adding several useful new ones, you
need Tab Ninja (bit.ly/ninja421). This
new extension expands Chrome with
options to close all pinned, audible or
muted tabs; tabs to the left or right of
the active one; tabs displaying pages
from the same website; and more. On
the downside, you right-click the page
rather than the tab to see the options,
and you can’t customise the lengthy
menu to remove entries you don’t need.
YouTube remembers how much of a video you’ve watched,
so you can instantly resume playback, but as a bookmarking
feature it’s not very sophisticated.
A much better option is the new Chrome
extension YouTube Bookmarker (bit.ly/
bookmarker421), which lets you easily
bookmark your favourite parts of videos
for future enjoyment. To use the add-on,
just click the Bookmarker button below the
video to open a panel on the right. Click Set
to bookmark the start point of the desired
section, then set the stop point and click
Save. You can also enter a title for the
bookmark, and create multiple bookmarks for the same
video. All the bookmarks you save are grouped under the
relevant video’s title in YouTube Bookmarker’s pop-up
toolbar panel, so you can open or delete them in a couple
of clicks. It’s a brilliant tool for YouTube addicts.

Forget Cortana and Siri – everyone
knows that the
original and best
virtual personal

Clippy,
Microsoft’s
adorable
paperclip
character,
who made
writing letters
such a pleasure in old
versions of Office. Now Clippy
is back as a Chrome extension
called Clippy Everywhere (bit.ly/
clippy421), which brings its chirpy
and not-at-all-annoying brand of
assistance to every web page you
visit. To be honest, this incarnation
of Clippy doesn’t do much more
than introduce itself, look around
for a while and then have a snooze,
but it still has nostalgic value, and
you can use it to drive other people
up the wall.
Stimulate your baby while

Trying to browse the web while looking
after a very young child is nigh-on

a clever solution called Baby Browser

lets you read online articles in a bubble
in the corner of your browser, while the
remaining space displays quirky
animations that have been “scientifically
proven to stimulate your baby’s brain”.
Just click the toolbar button to extract
the text from your chosen website and
then navigate it by pressing the Space
bar or the arrow keys on your keyboard.
All the while, your baby will be gurgling
with delight and developing their mental
faculties by watching red, white and
black shapes float and pulsate before
their eyes. The pace of the animation

Check if your add-ons will
stop working
As you may be aware, Mozilla
is planning to ditch traditional
Firefox add-ons soon in favour
of newfangled WebExtensions
that work across other
browsers. Some developers
have updated their tools
accordingly, but many haven’t
got round to it yet, which
means their add-ons won’t
work in future versions of
Firefox. You can find out if a favourite tool is in jeopardy by visiting its page
on the Mozilla Add-ons site (addons.mozilla.org) and clicking the Permissions link
next to the ‘Add to Firefox’ button. If you see a message that says: “Please note
this add-on uses legacy technology”, that means a WebExtension version isn’t
yet available. There’s still plenty of time for the developer to create one, so don’t
panic, but you’ll want to keep an eye on the page. WebExtensions are set to take
over completely when Firefox 57 is released in December.
Search YouTube by
right-clicking
Most modern browsers let you search
the web simply by highlighting and
right-clicking a name, word or phrase
on a page and choosing ‘Search Google
for...’. Wouldn’t it be useful if you could
use the same technique to find videos
on YouTube? That’s the idea behind
‘Search on YouTube’ (bit.ly/youtube421),
which adds just such a command to
your right-click menu so you can find
anything on YouTube in a jiffy. The
search results open in a new tab so
you won’t be taken away from your
current page.
Monitor eBay auction times
Have you ever missed out on an eBay
bargain because you opened a new tab
and forgot about the auction? If so,
you’ll appreciate eBay Time Left (bit.ly/
ebay421), which helpfully uses the tab’s
title to display how many minutes and
seconds remain until the auction ends.
Add new features to
Google Play
In our ‘Secret hacks for
Google Play’ feature last issue,
we recommended a Chrome
extension called Toolbox for
Google Play Store (bit.ly/
play414), which adds several
useful options to the app store.
We’re delighted to confirm that
it is now also available for Opera
(bit.ly/tool421) and works in
exactly the same way. The
extension adds a button to app
pages that lets you download
the app’s
APK file to
your PC,
as well as
others that

on AppBrain
and Android
Police. It also tells you if an app
offers a beta-testing program
that lets you try the latest
version before everyone else.

Want to know which
websites you visit most or what
your busiest times of day are for
browsing? Now Vivaldi can tell
you, thanks to a new History
feature that presents your
browsing patterns in the form
of graphs, charts and a colour-
coded calendar. You can view
the data by day, week or month

what time you opened each one.

Have you ever noticed that some of
the links you click on the web have a
lot of gobbledygook after the main
URL, such as: ‘?utm_source=google_

This is usually added so the website
or a third party can track what you
do next, for analytics or advertising
purposes. In our opinion, it’s a gross
invasion of privacy. Fortunately, help
is at hand from a new Firefox add-on
called Untrack Me (bit.ly/untrack421),
which automatically strips the
tracking information from web

being spied on. You can pause the

AUTOMATION
Workflow
workflow.is
8
Make everything you do
on your iPhone and iPad
quicker and easier using
this outstanding IFTTT-
style app, which has just
been bought by Apple –
and dropped its price
from £2.29 to nothing.
There are no hidden
charges or ads, either.
App Store users who
paid to download
Workflow don’t seem
disgruntled that it’s now
free. They simply like the
app too much to care.
Quite right, too, because Workflow’s automated
connections make iOS much more pleasurable to use.
Many things you do with your iOS device involve
a repetitive series of steps – for example, you take a
photo, add your favourite filter to it and then post it
on Facebook. Workflow shrinks that series of actions
to a single step called – you guessed it – a workflow.
You can run a workflow with a single tap or let the app
run it automatically in response to a trigger, such as
opening the camera or arriving at a certain location.
For more examples, launch the app and let the workflows
float across your screen. ‘Add to Reading List’, ‘Make Video
from GIF’, ‘Back up Photos’ –
it’s like a list of chores you
were supposed to have done
last weekend. With a little
patience, you can even create
your own workflows, but
there’s probably no need
when you have more than
200 presets to choose from,
and you can edit their
ingredients to suit you.
Workflow currently has no
plans to launch on Android
or online, and its acquisition
by Apple is unlikely to
change that. The app has
even dropped support for
certain Google
services,
including Chrome and Street View, although it
works with IFTTT (ifttt.com/workflow). You
may soon wonder how you coped without it.

As you’ve no doubt heard,
drivers for ‘gig economy’
taxi firm Uber aren’t

is well-documented, but
the upside is that you can
do it on your own terms
– to earn cash in
retirement, perhaps. All you
need is a licence, a car and
Uber’s blessing, which you
can apply for online (bit.ly/uber421) or through this app. Uber Driver’s
main role is to make life on the road less stressful and more financially
rewarding by helping you find customers, get them from A to B, then
log their payments. The app has just received a major update on both
platforms, with redesigned GPS navigation that now includes turn-by-
turn directions, colour-coded traffic alerts and a night mode to stop
you being dazzled by the map while driving at 3am.

sleep is the most

instead of

we often slog
through the day

until we’re little more than zombies.
Wakemode aims to change that by
analysing your sleep patterns and then
calculating your ‘battery level’, which
changes through the day to reveal
when you could benefit from a nap or
an early night. The app supports
Bluetooth sleep-tracking
devices, but you can also
enter your sleep patterns
manually. It’s easy to use
and surprisingly engaging.

Jane is wisely sending
messages using
end-to-end encryption
36 19 April - 2 May 2017
It’s the most secure way of sending messages so why is it under
threat from the British government? David Crookes explains all
End-to-end encryption
What is it?
End-to-end encryption is a system of
communication that only allows the
intended participants to access the
information that’s being sent back and
forth between
them. It is used
to prevent third
parties from
intercepting and
reading sensitive
and private data,
since it virtually
eliminates the
risk of messages
and documents
falling into the
wrong hands.
For this reason,
end-to-end encryption is typically
employed by businesses, banks and
messaging services such as WhatsApp.
Yet it is also proving to be highly
controversial.
Why is it in the news?
The technology came to the fore
in the wake of the Westminster
terrorist attack on 22 March
when it emerged that Khalid
Masood had used WhatsApp
seconds before carrying out
his actions. Home Secretary
Amber Rudd was keen to
discover what he was doing
in the app but she was
frustrated that the intelligence
services were unable to access
his encrypted messages in their
search for clues. She called on
WhatsApp’s developers to
allow future monitoring of the
service, saying “there should be
no places for terrorists to hide”.
Sounds reasonable. So what’s
the problem?
WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption
is there for a reason: it prevents
cybercriminals, hackers and snoopers
from seeing what users are sending
each other. It is such an effective tool
that WhatsApp itself is unable to see
the content of messages, so Rudd’s
insistence that the company hand over
details of what they contain is futile –
it doesn’t actually have anything it can
share. This situation has led to Rudd’s
comments being labelled “uninformed” –
see Barry’s column on page 74 for his
views on the matter – and has
also prompted fears that
the Facebook-owned
WhatsApp – which
has more than a billion
users who value its
privacy and secrecy –
could lose a crucial
selling point.
What can the
government do?
Amid talk of banning
the technology, Rudd
has raised the question
of whether a ‘backdoor’ needs to be built
into end-to-end encryption systems,
so that the intelligence services can
take a sneaky peek at what’s being sent –
whether that’s text, images, documents,
contacts or audio. To weigh the
consequences of this, however, it’s crucial
to have an understanding of how
end-to-end encryption works.
So how does it work?
To answer that, we need to look at the
WhatsApp process, which starts with
a public key being generated and saved
on the WhatsApp server when you sign
up to the service. When you begin
chatting with someone, the recipient’s
public key is retrieved and used to
scramble your message into a long series
of digits. The message is then sent on its
way, eventually landing on the recipient’s
device. At this point, it is unlocked using
a private key that is only saved on the
device itself, so the message can be read.
This means that any attempt to intercept
a message en route will only result in
gobbledegook because there is no way
to get hold of the private key without
having the device to hand.

TURN ON END-TO-END ENCRYPTION IN MESSENGER
Nobody can prevent Jane from using
end-to-end encryption
19 April - 2 May 2017 37
Discuss end-to-end encryption at forum.webuser.co.uk
End-to-end encryption
Why does this mean a
‘backdoor’ wouldn’t work?
Simply because it would go against the
entire principle of end-to-end encryption.
Producing a master key of sorts that
could wiretap WhatsApp’s messages
would compromise the whole system
and it is impossible to allow access to
one single third-party without potentially
opening it up to hackers and cyber-
criminals, too. Opponents to this kind
of move say it would also infringe on
the civil liberties of millions of users and
create a free-for-all. Ultimately, it would
render end-to-end encryption useless.
Does that mean terrorists can
continue to hide?
If end-to-end encryption remains in place
with no way for third-parties to intercept
and read messages, then yes, perhaps
it does. Only those involved in a given
conversation can read those messages
and that will, unfortunately, mean the
bad guys can operate undetected. But it
doesn’t mean there is absolutely no way
in. WhatsApp retains metadata that
includes the numbers contacted over
the service along with IP addresses. This
information has, in the past, been handed
to the authorities without compromising
the content of the messages. What’s
more, if the intelligence agencies found
a way to control someone’s single device
remotely, for instance, then they would
be able to access any messages – sent
or received – as if they were the user.
However, such hacking of individual
devices is a different issue entirely.
So does that mean my data is
still at risk?
Not really. The chances of the authorities
wanting to spend the necessary time
and resources to access your phone and
messages are slim, unless you are known
to be up to no good. You’d be at far
greater risk from hackers if they knew
they could intercept your messages and
financial information. The problem is that
you can’t create a backdoor for a select
group of people. It’s all or nothing.
Could someone turn off your
end-to-end encryption?
Not with WhatsApp, because end-to-end
encryption is turned on by default. This
means any messages you send through
it can only be viewed by the person
receiving them – and the same goes for
phone calls. The only requirement is that
both you and the person you’re chatting
with have the latest version of WhatsApp
installed on your devices. You’ll also be
made aware that calls and messages
you make and send are end-to-end
encrypted when you see a message
in the app telling you so.
Why aren’t all messaging
services end-to-end encrypted?
That’s a question for the developers.
The technology is certainly there, but
although all services encrypt your
messages, most only do so between
the customer and the service itself. For
example, Instagram stores your messages
on its own servers and someone could
feasibly read them from there. But that
doesn’t mean the authorities will be let in
without a fight. Last year, Apple refused
to allow the FBI to access a password-
protected iPhone belonging to a gunman.
Tech companies generally understand
the importance that most of us place
on the privacy of our data, and they are
reluctant to undermine our trust in them.
Will the government succeed in
banning such encryption?
Maybe, although previous discussions
about removing the technology have
come to nothing. In 2015, former Prime
Minister David Cameron proposed
banning encryption, saying he was
against a method of communication that,
“even in extremis, with a signed warrant
from the Home Secretary personally
cannot be read”. Last July, the
government said Amber Rudd would
be given powers to ban end-to-end
encryption. Yet it would be interesting
to see how much power the UK can exert
over Silicon Valley.
Isn’t this just a way to bolster
the Snooper’s Charter?
Some reckon so, but a ban on end-to-
end-encryption would require an
amendment to the Investigatory Powers
Act – the
so-called
Snooper’s
Charter.
It’s rather
telling that
a previous
plan to
outlaw the
technology
within the
proposed
bill was
dropped
following
widespread
opposition.
David Davis,
the current
Brexit secretary, said: “Such a move
would have had devastating
consequences for all financial
transactions and online commerce”.
The debate looks set to rumble on.
Although WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption as standard, in Facebook
Messenger you have to activate it manually. By doing so, you will be limited to using
the service on one device, but it means that your chats will not end up on Facebook’s
servers, making it impossible for them to be handed over to the authorities.
To enable what Facebook calls Secret Conversations within the mobile app,
open Messenger and tap your profile image. Tap the option for Secret Conversations
and turn it on. You’ll be asked to confirm that you want to do this. Now, when you
want to write a message in Android, you can start a chat and tap the Details icon to
select Secret Conversation. In iOS, you can tap the pencil icon in the right-hand
corner, select Secret, choose a user and write what you like.
A backdoor goes against the principle of
end-to-end encryption
Without end-to-end
encryption, anyone can
eavesdrop on you

he web has so much great free
stuff that it might seem greedy
to want even more, but if you
dig below the surface you can
uncover all manner of delights. Some
of the most interesting online content
isn’t immediately visible to the casual
browser because it’s either still being
tested, is supposed to have been
removed, isn’t prominently flagged
on the site’s homepage or can’t be
found for some other, more
mysterious reason. In this feature,
we reveal the web’s best-kept
secrets. Over the following six pages,
we show you how to access content
that’s no longer available, unlock
hidden tests and experiments, reveal
secret tools and forbidden sites, and
much more.
We also reveal some of the latest
Easter Eggs concealed in your
favourite websites and software,
from the cute cat that’s hidden in
Android Nougat to Google’s secret

Download Adobe Labs pre-
releases
Adobe rolls out beta versions of
programs through its Labs site (labs
.adobe.com) for you to try, although
you’d be forgiven for never knowing
it was there. These downloads include
new versions of Flash Player and Adobe
AIR, as well as plugins and extensions
for Adobe’s Photoshop and Lightroom
image-editing tools. Occasionally,
it also makes preview builds of major
programs such as Lightroom available
for free, so it’s certainly worth checking
back from time to time.
Sign up for BBC iPlayer beta tests
The BBC is always experimenting with
new features and technology in its
iPlayer service, and invites you to try
its latest tools. If you own an Android
device, you can sign up for the Mobile
iPlayer beta programme (bit.ly/
iplayera421) and test new features in the
mobile app prior to full release. In recent
years, these have included programme
downloads and the Live Restart option
for rewinding live broadcasts. There’s
also a beta version of iPlayer for
connected TVs and games consoles.
See the FAQ at bit.ly/iplayerc421 for
instructions on switching to this.
Download AVG Antivirus betas
Popular antivirus firm AVG has a secret
section on its website for beta testers.
Sign up to test its software and get a
free copy of the latest beta releases for
AVG AntiVirus Free and/or AVG Internet
Security. Bear in mind that the software
may be buggy and offers no updates or
technical support, but if you still want to
try the new software for free, you can
sign up at bit.ly/avgbeta421.
Test secret beta tools on
Wikipedia
Wikipedia has an experimental section
called Beta Features that lets you try
out new tools on the encyclopaedia and
other Wikimedia sites. You need to be
logged into the site to test the new
features and, once you are, go to bit.ly/
wikibeta421. Example new features
include Page Previews, which displays
previews when you hover the mouse
over a page link; and a New Wikitext
Mode for editing articles.
Sample secret YouTube
experiments
TestTube (bit.ly/testtube421) is Google’s
secret ideas incubator for YouTube,
where you can test experimental
features for the video site before
everyone else gets to try them. New
features come and go, and at the
moment YouTube is promoting ultra-
high-definition 4K videos, including
some that run at 60fps (frames per
second). If you have a display capable
of viewing this content, sign up for
TestTube and take a look at the
impressive 4K60 playlist. Make sure the
quality is set correctly under Settings.
Uncover the secrets of Gmail Labs
Google used to introduce various
experimental features to its webmail
service through its Labs. Sadly,
this element of Gmail is no longer
updated but Labs still exists and you can
enable any of the tools that are available
there. To access it, log into Gmail using
your web browser and click the cog

by typing in keywords that describe it
(for example, “new york times”) rather
than the exact URL. There’s also a new
Wayback Machine add-on for Chrome
(bit.ly/wbmchrome421) that lets you
view an archived version of any site you
visit, be it a recent capture or the site’s
very first incarnation.
Some images and media elements
may be missing from older snapshots
on the Wayback Machine, and the layout
might not
be quite as

Access pages hidden in Google
search results
The 2014 European Court of Justice
‘Right to be forgotten’ ruling forced
Google (and other search engines)
to remove links to certain stories
deemed “inadequate, irrelevant,
no longer relevant or excessive, and not
in the public interest”. The stories
themselves remain on the web, but they
no longer appear in search results. The
ruling only affects searches performed
in Europe, not the US, so if you search
UNCOVER REMOVED CONTENT
www.google.com rather than www
.google.co.uk, you’ll probably find the
results you want. Google has removed
the ‘Use Google.com’ link that used to
appear on the Google.co.uk homepage
(although not vice versa), but you can
go to www.google.com/ncr to stop the
web giant redirecting you to the UK
version of the search engine.
Read BBC news stories hidden
by Google
BBC news stories frequently get
removed from Google as part of the
European ‘Right to be forgotten’ ruling.
The BBC lists all the affected entries
in an effort to maintain transparency
and trust – something it’s been doing
since 2014. The list gets updated every
month and you can view the removed
stories at bit.ly/removedbbc421. It will
be interesting to see if the EU ruling
still applies post-Brexit.
Discover removed Wikipedia
articles
Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) regularly
removes articles that “do not meet
the relevant criteria for content of
the encyclopaedia”. Reasons for this
include copyright violations, advertising
or spam, vandalism and unreliable
sources. Deletionpedia (deletionpedia.
org) rescues Wikipedia articles which
are “under discussion” before they can
View web pages that have
disappeared
Web pages can vanish from the internet
for all sorts of reasons – they could
be pulled by the site administrator,
removed due to legal issues or culled
accidentally. The site itself may currently
be down or undergoing a revamp.
If you can’t open the page you want,
it’s possible that Google may have
‘cached’ (saved) a copy when it indexed
the site. To find out, search for the site
or page in Google and, when the results
appear, click the down arrow next to
the web address and select Cached.
The most recently saved version will
then open in your browser, even if the
page itself has since vanished.
Travel into the past with the
Wayback Machine
The Wayback Machine (web-beta
.archive.org) is a crucial part of the
massive Internet Archive that stores
multiple snapshots of websites going
back years. It currently has more than
284 billion pages that it’s saved over
time. Just type in a site URL, press Enter
and pick a year. Click any of the
coloured circles on the calendar to see
the site as it looked back then.
To give you an idea of the scale
of what’s cached, the Web User site
(www.webuser.co.uk) has, at the time of
writing, been saved 1,106 times between
4 April 2001 and 16 March 2017.
A handy Site Search feature was
added to the Wayback Machine last
October, which lets you look for a site
Visit Skull Island on Google Maps
Kong: Skull Island hit the cinemas earlier
this year, and Google has added the
location of the fictional island to Google
Maps. It’s in the Pacific Ocean, just south
of the equator (bit.ly/skull421). You can’t
explore the island (there’s a marker, but
nothing else), but you can leave a review.

19 April - 2 May 2017 41
REVEAL SECRET WEB TOOLS
add-on Quora Login Bypass (bit.ly/
quora417) to close the overlay and jump
straight into this hive of knowledge.
Uncover secret Netflix sub-
categories
There are thousands of secret
categories in Netflix that you can
only access by manually entering
a specific code at the end of the URL –
netflix.com/genre/mockumentaries,
for example. Instead of trying to guess
all the secret categories, you can use
the FindFlix add-on to do all the hard
work for you. It’s available for both
Chrome (bit.ly/ff421) and Firefox (bit.ly/
fffox421), and provides instant access
to more than 7,500 hidden categories.
Unlock Facebook’s secret inbox
If someone who isn’t friends with you
on Facebook tries to get in touch, their
messages may end up being filtered
into Facebook’s secret inbox. This is
essentially a hidden spam folder but
many non-spam messages end up here,
too. To access the inbox in the web
version of Facebook, click the Messages
button at the top of the page, then click
the Message Requests link and select
‘See filtered requests’. In iOS or
Android, open Messenger and, at the
bottom, tap People. Tap Message
Requests and view ‘Filtered requests’.
Browse Quora without logging in
Quora (www.quora.com) is a useful
question-and-answer site but,
annoyingly, the only way to browse it
is by signing in with your Google or
Facebook credentials, or by creating
an account with your email address.
Otherwise, the content is hidden behind
an overlay. However, there’s a trick you
can use that lets you view Quora
content without needing to log in.
Simply browse Google for the question
you want answering – “What are the
funniest answers on Quora”, for
example. Click a Quora result that
comes up, and you’ll be able to view the
answer on the site without logging in.
Alternatively, install the Firefox
Find secret Amazon discounts
Amazon regularly cuts the price of
products on its site, which can help you
bag a bargain – if you know where to
look. MoneySavingExpert.com has a
handy Amazon Discount Finder (bit.ly/
adfinder421) that lets you find hidden
deals with up to 75% off the usual price.
Choose a department to check, and an
optional sub-category, and enter some
keywords if you’re after something in
particular. You can specify the discount
range you’re looking for – by default,
this is 50 to 100%, but you can widen or
narrow it as required. You can also set a
minimum and maximum price for the
item, and choose to only show items
that qualify for free delivery. Click the
Search button to open Amazon in a new
tab and see the available deals.
On the same page, MSE also has
a tool that tells you whether a particular
item is becoming cheaper or dearer

tool CamelCamelCamel

As with Wikipedia, you can search for
a topic by name or view a random page.
There are currently more than 44,000
rescued pages available to read – by
repeatedly clicking ‘Random page’,
we found forbidden articles on Trains
of Central Railway (India), obscure
actor Todd Michael Schwartzman and,
ironically, a complaint about
Wikipedia’s resident ‘deletionists’.

Maps
Google Maps now covers most of the
planet – but not all of it. Some places
are so classified they have been
removed – typically blurred or covered
– from Maps for security reasons. These
include military air bases, nuclear sites,
army headquarters and high-security
prisons. You won’t be able to see them
in Maps, but you can find out about
some of them by watching the video
at bit.ly/hiddenmaps421.
One workaround is to try rival
mapping service Bing Maps (www.bing
.com/maps), which uses its own aerial
photography that’s sometimes higher
quality and uncensored.

ACCESS FORBIDDEN CONTENT
Access banned websites
Many sites that allow illegal downloads
and file sharing have been banned by
the UK courts. If you try to visit any of
them, you’ll see a message from your
ISP telling you that the site is blocked
for legal reasons. You can get around
this by installing a VPN, of which
TunnelBear (www.tunnelbear.com) and
CyberGhost (www.cyberghostvpn.com)
are our current free favourites. Both
work on Windows, MacOS, Android and
iOS, and offer reliable, reasonably fast
download and upload speeds.
TunnelBear also has a nifty Chrome
extension (bit.ly/tbear421).
Although your ISP can tell when you
Search for content on the Deep
Web
Not to be confused with the Dark Web
– which is a collection of often legally
and morally dubious websites on an
encrypted network that can only be
accessed using special software – the
Deep Web refers to all the pages on the
web that you can’t find using a normal
search engine. There’s a huge number of
these pages that you don’t know about
– it’s estimated the Deep Web is around
500 times the size of the web itself – but
you can uncover them if you know how.
You’ll find an extensive list of Deep
Web search engines you can try at bit
.ly/deepweb421 – our favourites include
the WWW Virtual Library (vlib.org)
and DeeperWeb (deeperweb.com).
access the web through a VPN (the port
used by the tool to connect to the
internet makes this apparent), it can’t
see what you’re doing there and,
besides, VPN services are perfectly
legal to use.
Watch geographically restricted
videos
Some YouTube videos – mostly music
and TV ones – won’t play in the UK
because of geographical restrictions.
This can be frustrating, but you can get
around the block by using the
TunnelBear VPN add-on for Chrome
mentioned in the previous tip. When
you encounter a video that’s restricted
in this country, set TunnelBear to the
US, toggle it on, and reload the page.
View content hidden behind
overlays
Some websites use an overlay to mask
their content. The overlay could be
a message asking you to sign up to
a mailing list, for example, or pestering
you to subscribe. Not only do you have
to waste time reading the message that
appears over the site, but you then have
to work out what you need to do to
close the overlay.
To solve this problem, install
BehindTheOverlay (bit.ly/btoverlay421)
for Chrome and Firefox and, when you
encounter a site with an overlay, just
click its toolbar button to close the
annoyance and reveal the page below.
The add-on hasn’t been updated in
a while, but we found that it still
works fine.
Siri thinks you’re Lego Batman
If you have an iPhone or iPad, summon Siri
and say “Hey computer”, and she will
respond to you as if you are Lego Batman.
Try it several times to get different
responses. This was added to tie in with
the recent Lego Batman Movie and may
be removed eventually.
Google’s Chrome smileys
If you open more than 100 tabs in Chrome on iOS or Android
(hey, some people do), the tab counter will switch to show an
old-school smiley face – :) on iOS and :D on Android. However,
if you open over 100 tabs in Chrome in Incognito mode in
Android, you’ll see a winking face – ;)
Listen to animal sounds in Google Search
If you ask Google: “What sound
does a cow make?”, the search giant
will respond with a mooing noise.
That’s not the only animal sound
available to listen to, either. The rest
of the menagerie includes sheep
(baa), horse (neigh), lion (roar),
tiger (grr) turkey (gobble gobble),
dog (woof), cat (meow), and ape
(ooh ooh eeh eeh).

found both quicker and easier to access
than the tools provided by the other
add-ons in this test. If you have other
links and bookmarks that you want to
access directly from the New Tab page,
Beautab supports this with its Quick
Links feature. For Google searches, the
extension offers one-click access to the
standard Chrome New Tab page,
which is also handy for viewing your
most visited sites.
If you’re the type of person who’s
prone to procrastination, you’ll benefit
from Beautab’s Wasted Time feature,
which gives a live update of how much
time you’ve wasted on popular sites
such as Facebook and Reddit.
Other embellishing features include
daily inspirational quotes and the option
to set a countdown to an important
event. Everything about Beautab is
simple and intuitive and the New Tab
page is automatically synced across all
your computers.
How it can be improved:
Beautab lacks the weather tools of our
other award winners and you’re only
allowed to use your own photos as
wallpaper if you make a one-off
payment of $1.50 (around £1.20).
OUR VERDICT
There’s very little not to like about
Beautab. It’s fast, attractive and
easy to use, so unless you
desperately want a weather widget,
we’d recommend it ahead of the
other add-ons in this round-up.
Make your New Tab
page more useful by
adding extra features
to it. Edward Munn

best tools for the job

Best New Tab pages
What we liked:
Every time you open a new
tab, Infinity displays a
simple, intuitive grid of
app shortcuts and
bookmarks (along with a
Google search bar) to make
it quicker and easier to launch
your favourite websites and services.
Indeed, if you’re not a fan of Chrome’s
default bookmarks bar, Infinity offers an
excellent alternative that’s fully
customisable, so you can rearrange, add
and remove shortcuts, and even choose
how many icons to display on a page.
By default, it includes handy apps for
History, Bookmarks and Apps, so you
don’t need to use Chrome’s built-in
tools. You can add more apps by
clicking the ‘+’ icon and searching
Infinity’s library or save any web page
by clicking the Infinity icon on the
toolbar when you’re viewing it.
Infinity offers free cloud syncing, so
the launcher will look the same on all
your computers. It also lets you use
your own wallpaper and add additional
search engines. We like that Infinity’s
app icons can display live info including
What we liked:
Like Beautab, Momentum
offers a range of handy
productivity tools within
a simple, attractive
interface. In addition to its
striking wallpapers, there’s
a large clock, under which you
can set your main focus for the day.
A simple to-do list lets you add further
reminders, and you can see the current
weather conditions at a glance, too.
As with our Gold Award winner,
Momentum encourages you get the
most out of your day by displaying
inspirational quotes and showing you
what percentage of your working day
you’ve completed – just double-click
the clock to see this.
Like Beautab, it also assumes that
you’re happy to use Chrome’s built-in
tools to manage bookmarks. However,
you can save further links directly to the
new tab page by clicking Momentum’s
Links button, which already offers quick
shortcuts to your Chrome apps, Gmail
and a standard Chrome tab. You also
get a simple Google search bar for
carrying out instant searches.
How it can be improved:
All Momentum’s standout features,
including the option to integrate it with
external services, require you to pay a
fee of $2.50 (around £2) a month.
Furthermore, the tool’s settings menu
can be a bit slow and buggy at times,
and we found it frustrating that there
was no option to set the start and end
times of your working day.
the current weather conditions and the
number of unread messages in Gmail.
How it can be improved:
Infinity’s launcher-style interface
doesn’t display elements such as to-do
lists at a glance – you need to open the
relevant app. It also takes a little longer
to set up than our other award winners
and has a less inspiring design.
OUR VERDICT
If you want to add a fully
customisable launcher to your New
Tab page, Infinity is the best tool for
the job. It’s fast, free and easy to
use, making it an excellent choice
for those who want more than
Chrome’s default tools.
OUR VERDICT
Momentum looks great but it failed
to offer any standout features for
free, and we found Beautab faster
and easier to use.
Currently
bit.ly/currently421
Currently is by far the simplest tool
in this round-up. It displays the
current time and a five-day weather
forecast
in a
simple,
attractive
interface,
steering
away
from the landscape photography
and clutter of many of its
competitors. Beyond changing
the background and text colour,
however, there are no customisation
options, and most users will find it
lacking in features.
DayBoard
bit.ly/dayboard421
DayBoard is an excellent tool that
asks for your five most important
tasks for today (and tomorrow) so
that you see them every time you
open a new tab. You can set it to
block you from visiting distracting
websites so that you get more work
done, and
it will
count the
number of
times
you’re
distracted
during the
day (to guilt-trip you into
concentrating on work!). Although
it offers quick shortcuts to your
bookmarks and apps, DayBoard
came up short on features when
compared to our award winners.
Toby
bit.ly/toby421
If you’re the sort of person who
normally has far too many tabs
open, Toby can help you to get on
top of the problem by helping you
save and
manage
your web
pages for
viewing
later. It’s
a handy
tool that
can improve your focus, but it lacks
the tools for creating to-do lists and
taking notes that our award winners
provide. We also found its lack of
wallpaper rather disappointing.

Google can alert you when someone
mentions your name online
You can receive alerts once a day or week,
from specific sources
Find out if anyone is talking about you on
social-media sites
Social Searcher lets you filter social
mentions by various criteria
46 19 April - 2 May 2017
Ask Google to alert you
to online mentions
It may seem vain to get Google to scour
the web every day for mentions of your
name – after all, it probably has many
more important things to do. But as
the biggest, fastest and most accurate
search engine, it’s by far the best place
to start, and its excellent Google Alerts
service (www.google.com/alerts) does
the job for free.
To use Google Alerts, simply visit
the site while signed into your Google
account and it will suggest an option
or two for creating alerts: usually your
name and email address. Select one or
both of these, then click the Edit button
to specify how frequently you want to
receive alerts (once a day, once a week
or “as it happens”); the type of sources
to peruse (news stories, blogs, videos,
web pages or discussions); the language
and region to search in; and if you want
“only the best” results or all of them.
Alerts are sent directly to your inbox
– unless you choose to receive them as
an RSS feed – and can be deleted at any
time. Because Google Alerts is free,
it won’t cost you anything to also search
for common misspellings of your name,
in case the person who’s talking about
you is a sloppy typist.
Keep track of mentions
on social media
The ‘walled gardens’ of social networks
are difficult for Google to penetrate,
but their own search engines are pretty
poor. Fortunately, there are several
options available that can find mentions
of your name on sites including Twitter,
Flickr, Reddit and Instagram – Facebook
is more of a challenge because it now
blocks third-party search tools –
although many are aimed at ‘brands’
rather than people.
Our favourite is Social Searcher
(www.social-searcher.com), which lets
you search across all the main social
networks in one place and filter your
results by date, popularity, content type
and even sentiment – positive, negative
or neutral. The free version limits you
to 100 searches and two email alerts
Nobody likes being talked
about behind their back
but it’s useful to know if it’s
happening. Robert Irvine
reveals how to find out whether
and where you’ve been
mentioned online
per day; you can get other useful
features such as live monitoring,
from £3 per month.
Another option is Social Mention
(www.socialmention.com), which is free
to use but not as extensive as paid-for
tools such as Mention (mention.com)
or eClincher (eclincher.com). Search for
your name and where to look, such as
in blogs, micro blogs (meaning Twitter),
bookmarks (meaning Reddit, oddly),
videos or across everything.

embarrassing Twitter blunder

To monitor social-media mentions
in real time, you can’t beat Hootsuite
(hootsuite.com), which provides live,
side-by-side feeds of Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn and
Google+ profiles. This means you can
see posts about or directed to you as
soon as they appear, and reply straight
away, as well as searching for your name
across every service. The free version of
Hootsuite limits you to three social
accounts; you can manage up to 10 for
£7.99 per month.
Just make sure you don’t blunder
as Ed Balls did six years ago and tweet
your own name instead of searching
for mentions of it. That fateful date –
28 April – has become known as Ed
Balls Day, much to the former Shadow
Chancellor’s eternal embarrassment.
Search across online
discussion boards
Despite the popularity of social
networks, plenty of internet message
boards are still going strong, including
our own Web User Forums (forum
.webuser.co.uk) – drop by and say Hi!
You can find out if anyone’s discussing
you on a discussion board using the
dedicated forum-search engine
Boardreader (boardreader.com).
Just enter your name (or your forum
pseudonym) and click the Search button
to find matching results from boards
across the web. Click the cog icon
to filter results by date, domain and
whether the match was found in a forum
post or in a thread title (if you’re really
paranoid!). Boardreader doesn’t search
every forum, but we found it fast
and accurate.
Find out who’s looking
for you online
If someone’s really interested in you,
chances are they’ll want to know where
you live, which is even more unnerving
than them casually mentioning your
name. Online directory 192.com has
a service called See Who’s Looking For
You (bit.ly/see421), which alerts you
when someone searches for your name
on the site. The information is collated
in the form of detailed reports that tell
you exactly who was looking for you,
the dates and times they did so, and
even the search terms they used. You
don’t need to be listed on 192.com to
receive this data, but you do need to
pay a subscription of £3.59 per month
or £35.99 per year. The first 30 days are
free, but you need to provide your card
details and remember to cancel.
Check who’s tagged
you on Facebook
Some people like being tagged in
Facebook posts and photos, but the rest
of us regard it an irritating invasion of
privacy. To discover who’s been tagging
and talking about you, go to www
.facebook.com/settings and click
Privacy. In the ‘Who can see my stuff?’
section, select Use Activity Log next to
‘Review all posts and things you’re
tagged in’ to see a list of links, photos,
status updates and comments that
mention you. Click the Edit button in the
top-right corner of an item and choose
Remove Tag to stop it appearing when
people search Facebook for your name.
To prevent unauthorised tagging
happening in future, select ‘Timeline
and Tagging’ on the Settings page and
set the option ‘Review posts that friends
tag you in before they appear on your
timeline’ to On. You should also ensure
that ‘Who can see posts you’ve been
tagged in on your timeline’ is set to
Friends or Only Me.
Before you get angry that someone
on Twitter has called you a
“wazzock”, remember that there are
probably hundreds if not thousands
of people with the same name as you.
My research for this feature was
hampered by the fact that I share a
moniker with a critically acclaimed
cellist and a ‘celebrity’ chef. The
latter Robert Irvine even has his
own eponymous TV chat show and
magazine (see picture), making it
difficult to find my humble self
among his worshipping fans. One
way around this problem is to use
the old tricks of placing a minus
sign in front of word to exclude it
from a search, and a plus sign to
force its inclusion, for example:
“Robert Irvine” –chef –cello
–“TV chat show” +“Web User”
+London. It’s useful to include
terms such as places you’ve lived and
worked, job titles and the names of
friends and partners. Otherwise, you
may come across mentions such as:
“Why the hell has that douche bag
Robert Irvine got a TV chat show
now?” (bit.ly/why421).
SHARING YOUR NAME ONLINE
Frankly, we wish
we’d never
discovered this

48 19 April - 2 May 2017
1
Paint 3D
Paint 3D is a new app built into
Windows 10 that lets you easily ‘doodle’
3D objects and scenes. It’s fun to play
with, and you can achieve impressive
results with a little clicking and
dragging around.
Although you can work with pre-
made models from Microsoft’s Remix
3D website and even send your creation
to a 3D printer, Paint 3D lacks the
precision tools needed to create
complex real-world objects and is not
a substitute for specialist design
software. Nor does it replace the
original Paint tool that’s been packaged
with every version of Windows ever
released, so you can simply steer clear
of the new 3D app if you prefer working
with flat drawings.
2 Night Light
If you find the blue light from
your monitor keeps you awake at night,
you should try the excellent new
Night Light tool included with Creators
Update. Similar to F.lux (justgetflux
.com), this handy new feature
automatically changes your screen to
a warmer colour at night to reduce the
strain on your eyes. To enable it, open
Settings, System and Display, then click
Night Light Settings and ‘Turn on now’.
You can use the slider to pick a colour
temperature you like and turn ‘Schedule
night light’ to On to choose the hours
for it to be active.
3 Better controls for
Windows Update
One common complaint about Windows
10 is that it forces you to install updates,
often at inconvenient times. Although
Microsoft hasn’t changed its mind on
this, you can now pause updates for up
to seven days in Windows 10 Pro and
Enterprise so you’re not interrupted
when you’re in the middle of something.
The Creators Update is the biggest improvement yet to
Windows 10. Edward Munn picks the best new tools and
enhancements in the updated operating system
To do this, open Settings, then click
‘Update & security’ and ‘Advanced
options’ under ‘Update settings’. On this
page, turn Pause Updates on.
Microsoft has also extended the
maximum length of your ‘active hours’
from 12 hours to 18 hours on all versions
of Windows 10, so you can make sure
you don’t get caught out by updates
when you restart your PC in the
evening. Choose ‘Change active hours’
below ‘Update settings’ in ‘Update &
security’, then set the hours during
which you’d rather not be interrupted
by Windows Update.
4 Improved privacy
controls
Another common concern that
accompanied the release of Windows 10
was the lack of privacy it offered users.
Before you install Creators Update,
you’ll be invited to review your privacy
settings and are no longer encouraged
to pick an Express, recommended
configuration. Instead, a page appears
providing clear information that lets you
pick a configuration that best suits you.
Along with this change, Microsoft has
introduced a new online privacy centre

where you can check up on the
information that’s stored about you
online, and delete it from Microsoft’s
servers. Simply visit account.microsoft
.com/privacy, sign into your account
and you can use the appropriate
buttons to view your browsing, search
and location history.
5 Better tab-management
in Edge
Edge has been updated in the latest
Windows build to include some handy
new tab-management tools. First, the
browser now lets you preview all your
open tabs at once simply by clicking the
down arrow in the tab bar. There are
also new icons at the left side of the tab
bar that let you ‘set aside’ all your
current tabs, temporarily hiding them in
a sidebar from which you can restore
them when it’s convenient to do so.
6 Do more with Cortana
Cortana has also had a major
overhaul in the Creators Update and
now lets you perform new actions
including controlling the volume of
audio, and locking, restarting or
shutting down your PC or laptop. The
personal assistant now also supports
third-party applications for the first
time, so you can use it to control apps
including Netflix, Wunderlist and the
Weather Channel. To view a full list of
apps that are compatible with Cortana,
visit bit.ly/cort421.
7 Buy and read ebooks
For the first time, Edge now
supports unprotected EPUB files,
meaning you can open ebooks in your
browser in the same way that you open
a PDF file. The Microsoft Store has also
added a section for Books and when
you download one, it automatically
opens in your browser so in theory, you
could get rid of your Kindle and use
your Windows tablet or laptop as an
e-reader instead.
8 Free up space
automatically
If you’re forever running low on hard-
drive space, you can now set Windows
10 to automatically free up storage by
deleting temporary files and emptying
your Recycle Bin. This new feature is
called Storage Sense and can be
activated by opening Settings, then
System and Storage. If you would rather
it only deleted temporary files and not
files that have been in your Recycle Bin
for over 30 days, click the button to
‘Change how we free up space’.
9 Auto-lock your PC when
you’re away
The Creators Update lets you set
Windows to automatically lock when
you move away from your PC. To take
advantage of the feature, you simply
need to pair your computer with
a compatible Bluetooth device (from
Settings, Devices) and turn on Dynamic
Lock. To do this, open Settings and
Accounts, then click ‘Sign-in options’
and scroll down to ‘Dynamic lock’. Tick
the box to ‘Allow Windows to detect
when you’re away and automatically
lock the device’ – and that’s it. Windows
will automatically lock when you’ve
been away from your PC for more than
30 seconds.
10
10
1
Better Start menu
The Start menu is now more
versatile than ever thanks to the new
app-grouping feature added in the
Creators Update. To group apps in the
Start menu, drag and drop one on top
of another. Clicking the new tile will
expand the group to let you see its
contents and if you want to remove an
app, you can do so by simply dragging
it back out of the folder. If you want to
hide the app list on the Start menu, you
can now do this by opening Settings,
Personalisation and Start, then turning
‘Show app list in Start menu’ to Off.
Several tools set to be introduced
in the Creators Update were not
available to test in the Insider
Preview at the time of writing.
Cortana, for example, is expected
to bring much greater continuity
between your devices. By installing
the Cortana app on your iOS (bit.
ly/cortanai421) or Android (bit.ly/
cortanaa421) device, you’ll be able
to view your smartphone
notifications on your PC and access
important PC notifications on your
smartphone. What’s more, Cortana
will even let you sync your
clipboard between devices and use
the ‘copy to’ voice command to
copy content between them.

OS Maps Aerial View: bit.ly/ordsur421 |
20 mins | Any browser
52 19 April - 2 May 2017
O
rdnance Survey has launched
a spectacular new 3D mapping
service, which integrates with its
online OS Maps tool. The new feature
uses the unrivalled topographic OS
surveys of the English, Welsh and
Scottish countryside to create a three-
dimensional landscape, which it then
overlays with detailed aerial photos.
The result is a realistic and incredibly
detailed virtual landscape stretching
from Lands End to John O’ Groats, which
you can move around and zoom into.
You have to pay for the service, but
there’s a free seven-day trial if you’d like
to give it a go. If you decide to keep it,
you can pay an annual subscription of
£19.99 or buy access for a single month
(perhaps if you’re going on a walking trip
or want to extend your trial) for £3.99.

Workshop 2
54 19 April - 2 May 2017
Create Kodi user profiles to
control household viewing
2
On the Settings – Profiles page, select Profiles. 1 If you’ve
never created a profile before, you’ll see just two tiles –
‘Master user’ (which is the default) 2 and ‘Add profile’, 3
which we’ll use to create our first new user. Click the ‘Add
profile’ tile. On the following screen, enter the first user’s name
and click OK.
1
Make sure you have the latest version of Kodi installed –
it’s called Krypton and uses the Estuary interface. If you
don’t, the interface will be different to this Workshop and
the steps won’t be quite the same. Launch the software and
click the gear icon at the top-left to open the program settings.
In the System menu, select the ‘Profile settings’ tile. 1
3
Each user will have their own profile folder. If you want
this to be in a particular location on your hard drive,
you can browse for it. 1 You can also create a new folder
by clicking the button. 2 If you’re happy to accept the default
choice, click the OK button 3 to move on.
4
The ‘Edit profile’ screen appears. You can change the
profile name, add a picture, change the profile directory
and manage the ‘Lock preferences’. 1 If you have shared
media files, you can keep ‘Media info’ (information about music
and videos) and ‘Media sources’ (where you keep downloaded
music and movies) separate 2 or share them with other profiles.
Y
ou can watch almost anything you like on Kodi
– from videos you’ve recorded or downloaded
to TV shows and blockbuster movies. However,
this Kodi content is shared with everyone in your
household, and it’s difficult to see who has watched
(and favourited) what. If you don’t like the idea of
sharing your media library or you want to stop people
watching content illegally through add-ons,
you can use Kodi’s support for multiple profiles.
Each user has his or her own watchlist, and you
can block them from using add-ons that you
haven’t sanctioned. Switching between profiles
is very easy via the login screen that appears
each time you start Kodi.

Wayne Williams says
To make it easier to tell which
user profile you are in, it’s worth
setting a colour or skin for each
account so they look different
from one another. To do this, log
into the first profile, then click the
Settings gear icon on the main
screen and select ‘Interface
settings’. Select the Skin tab on
the left and click Colours. There
are 14 to choose from.

Click ‘Lock preferences’ and set a Master Lock password.
You will need to enter this to make changes in the future.
Enable ‘Profile lock’ 1 to protect a profile with a
password. You can lock individual elements of the interface, 2
lock the file manager 3 and lock the settings. 4 If you don’t
want add-ons being added, lock the add-on manager. 5
6
You’re asked if you want to ‘Start with fresh settings
or copy from default’. Copying over the current settings
will save you time and won’t affect the choices you
selected for media info and sources, but if you have anything
installed that you don’t want to pass on, such as add-ons,
choose ‘Start fresh’. 1
7
Back on the Settings – Profiles screen, your new profile 1
appears next to the ‘Master user’. If you want individual
profiles for other family members, click ‘Add profile’ 2
again and repeat the setup process for the next Kodi user,
until everyone has their own profile.
8
To ensure that everyone logs into their own profile when
they use Kodi, you need to enable the login screen
(it’s off by default). On the Settings – Profiles page,
click the General tab 1 and switch on the ‘Show login screen
on startup’ setting. 2 If you don’t do this, Kodi will
automatically load the last used profile when it starts. 3
10
The first time you select a new account, the ‘First
logon, edit your profile’ screen appears. You can
change the username 1 and add a profile picture, 2
if this wasn’t added during setup. Click OK 3 and that user
will now be able to customise Kodi within the limits set up
in Step 5.
9
To test the login screen, go back to the homepage,
click the power button and select ‘Log off Master user’.
Kodi will log out and return to the login screen,
presenting the available profiles, including ‘Master user’,
in a strip down the side. 1 Select the profile you want to open
from the list of choices.

Log into your router from a browser. Most routers have an
address you can enter but if yours doesn’t, type ipconfig
into a Command Prompt window and use the IP address 1
next to Default Gateway. Enter the username and password 2
(these can often be found printed on the base of the router). 2
Look for your router’s Quality of Service settings. If your
router splits its settings into Basic and Advanced, it will
probably be in the latter. Some routers may call it Media
Prioritization 1 or something similar. Basic ISP routers may not
have it at all.
3
Add a device you want prioritised and drag it from Normal
Priority 1 to High Priority. 2 This router gives identifiable
names to attached devices but some routers use a MAC
address, which you can find in a device’s settings or, on a PC,
by running ipconfig /all and looking for Physical Address. 4
Some tools let you set the amount of prioritised
bandwidth so you can manage download and upload
speeds, 1 and ensure other users aren’t hit too hard.
Speedtest (www.speedtest.net) shows your broadband speed
so you can devote some (but not all) of it to a favoured device.
5
You may be able to give priority to specific services, and
some may be set up already. 1 You can use these settings
to ensure that gamers aren’t getting in the way of your
video streaming or vice versa. If a service you want to restrict
isn’t listed, see if you can add it by searching for its settings. 6
If the device you want to prioritise is connected to your
router using an Ethernet cable, you may be able to favour
this over Wi-Fi connections (or vice versa). Look for
options that let you choose Interface Priority 1 (or something
similar).

S
haring your network with other people – especially if they
are streaming video or playing games – can feel like
you’re not getting your fair share of the bandwidth. You
can prioritise your own devices (to the detriment of others!)

settings on your router. All routers are
different but here are some guidelines
to help you find your settings.

to find out how to download your
messages to Thunderbird.
The other option is to use a program
such as MailStore Home (bit.ly/msh421).
This backs up all your emails and works
with any webmail service, including
Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo Mail.
Adding a new account takes seconds and
everything is configured automatically

How to...
Back up your webmail
messages
What happens if your webmail company hits the wall? Wayne
Williams shows you how to back up your emails, just in case
Software to back up your
webmail
There are two types of programs you can
use to back up your messages. The first
is a traditional email client such as
Thunderbird (bit.ly/thunbird421), Mailbird
(www.getmailbird.com) or The Bat
(bit.ly/batemail421). Windows 10 users
can also make use of the Mail app that
comes with their operating system.
Follow our Mini Workshop on page 61
M
ost people now use
webmail, rather than
an email service
provided by their ISP. It’s easy
to understand why – webmail
lets you view and access your
messages from anywhere,
on any connected device,
whether that’s a PC, laptop,
tablet or smartphone. You can
even access your email on
smart TVs.
The downside to webmail
is that you need an internet
connection to browse and
open old messages, and
there’s always the danger that
the company that’s storing the
data could disappear and take
all your messages with it.
While that’s unlikely to
happen with Google or
Microsoft (Yahoo is less of a
sure bet), it won’t do you any
harm to prepare for the worst.
consolidate your messages, and the
program fully encrypts all databases
and password-protects archives. It also
intelligently reduces the amount of space
your emails take up by only saving the
first instance of an attachment. We show
you how to use MailStore Home in our
Mini Workshop, opposite.
If you’re a Gmail user, you can back up
your messages using a program such as

(bit.ly/gotyb421). The latter is a
command-line tool that backs up and
restores your Gmail account.
If you’re happy to pay for a service that
backs up your messages to the cloud,
there’s Dropmyemail (bit.ly/dmye421).
It costs from $19.99 (around £16) a year
for 10GB of storage, and you can try it
for free for 15 days.
Clean up before backing up
Webmail services provide a lot of space
for messages and attachments, which
means there’s no reason to regularly
delete unwanted emails. As a result,
many of us have large, crowded inboxes.
Before you back up anything, you
should tidy up and remove any junk.
Gmail has a powerful search function that
makes it very easy to find and delete
unwanted messages. If you want to
delete everything from a specific sender,
type in their email address and press
Enter. Click the tick box under the search
bar to select all the messages and then
1
Launch the program and click the
Archive E-mail link under Quick
Access. From here, you can archive
messages from any of the supported
email clients 1 or load email files. 2
To back up content from a webmail
service, enter your email address
in the box 3 and click Start. 4
2
The process that follows will depend
on the webmail service you use. If it’s
Gmail, a browser window will open for
you to select your account (if you have
more than one) and grant MailStore
Home permission to manage your email.
A profile will be created. 1 Double-click
it to start the archiving process.
3
The software will begin importing
your email. This will take a while
but you can just leave it running in the
background. To view your download
messages, open My Archive 1 and
expand your profile name, then choose
between Inbox and Sent. Select a
message 2 to view it. 3
before:2012/12/01 for example,
will bring up all messages received
before that date. You can then select
and delete them.
Copy your messages over
to another service
Copying your webmail from one service
to another – Gmail to Outlook.com, for
example – is one way to make sure your
emails are safe, even if one service shuts
down or becomes unavailable. However,
this is no longer as easy as it once was.
Webmail services such as Google,
Microsoft and Yahoo all used to use
a service called TrueSwitch to simplify
the process of switching from one email
provider to another, but that closed down
some years ago. Yippie Move (www
.yippiemove.com) is the closest modern
equivalent, but will cost you from $14.95
(around £12) for a transfer.
You can import messages from any
existing webmail account to Gmail using
Google’s ShuttleCloud-powered tool.

You can also identify messages with

When you first run Thunderbird,
it will ask if you want a new email
address. Click ‘Skip this and use my

for you (you can change this if you
want). 1 Enter your email address and

are simply downloaded so deleting an

In Gmail, click the cog and select

Enter the details of the account you want
to import your messages from, then step

A final option to consider is Imapsync
(bit.ly/ims421). This open-source tool
can migrate email between two IMAP
(Internet Message Access Protocol)
servers – which covers most webmail
services. To use it, you just enter some
text instructions in the Windows
Command Prompt box. It sounds
complicated but it’s not – just follow the
simple instructions on the website.
Imapsync costs ¤50 (around £43) but
you can try it online at bit.ly/imsy421,
provided you don’t

email addresses
and passwords
for both source
and destination
accounts.
Back up your
email to an
external drive
If you want to be
able to access your
webmail from
anywhere, even
when you are
without an internet connection, it makes
sense to back up your emails to an
external drive that you can carry around
with you. This could be to an external
hard drive or a USB memory stick (it just
needs to have a large enough capacity).
You can do this in MailStore Home.
During setup, choose where the program
should be installed. If you have an
external drive plugged into your
computer, it will appear as a destination
in the list. Select it and install a portable
version on it. All your emails will be
downloaded to this drive and can be
accessed from there.
Alternatively, MailStore Home offers
you the option to back up to an external
drive from the main menu. Click the
‘Backup to HDD or USB’ link, then browse
to the drive and folder you want to save
the backup to.

then tap the one you want to block.
The sender’s number is automatically
inserted. Tap the plus button to add it
to the blocked list.
Different phones and versions of
Android have different menus. If you
use Android Messages, for example,
open a message, tap the three-dot
menu button and select ‘People &
options’. Tap Block.
WhatsApp can also block people.
Open the offending conversation on
your Android phone, tap the menu
button and select More, then Block.
On the iPhone version, tap the person
at the top of the conversation screen
to show the contact, then scroll down to
the bottom and tap ‘Block this Contact’.
The Messages app on the iPhone has
a selection of useful blocking tools.
For example, go to Settings, Messages
and turn on Filter Unknown Senders.
This disables notifications for people
who aren’t in your Contacts so they
can’t pester you. Messages from
unknown people are put in a separate
list, so you can still access them.
Also in Settings, you’ll find the
Blocked option. Tap it, then tap Add
New to select a contact you want to
block. It stops messages, phone calls
and FaceTime. If a message comes
from someone who is not in your

If blocking individual numbers
isn’t doing the trick, try blocking
messages by content instead.

phrases will be blocked from your inbox.
View blocked messages on
Android
If you’re worried that a message
you want to see might have been
blocked, go to the messaging app, open
the menu, tap Settings, then ‘Block
messages’. Tap ‘Blocked messages’ to
see a list of items. It works just like the
regular inbox, so you can tap a message
to read it, long-press to select it for
deletion and so on.
React to Apple Messages
Like Facebook, Messages on the
iPhone lets you show your reaction
to a message. When viewing a message
in a conversation, press and hold until
an icon bar appears above it. Tap one of
the icons, such as the heart, thumbs up
or down, laughter, exclamation points or
question mark.
Use WhatsApp on your PC
If you’re sitting at your computer,
you might find it quicker and
easier to type messages on a proper
keyboard instead of your phone’s
screen. It’s very easy to set up – just
open a browser and go to web
.whatsapp.com. A QR code is displayed.
Open WhatsApp on your iPhone and
tap the gear icon to open Settings.
Tap WhatsApp Web/Desktop and point
your phone at the computer screen.
It connects instantly and you’re
immediately online.
Select Settings on the menu, then
More Settings. Select ‘Text messages’
and switch on ‘Delivery reports’, then
select ‘Multimedia messages’ and
switch on ‘Delivery reports’ and
‘Read reports’.
The process on the iPhone is a little
different. You can’t request a read
receipt but you can enable your own
read receipts, which tells people when
you have read their messages. Ask
your friends to enable their read
receipts so you can tell when your
messages have been read.
Switch messaging apps
Android lets you swap the
standard text-messaging app
that comes with your phone for
a different one. The alternatives have
different tools and ways of working
that might suit you better. For
example, go to the Google Play store
and find Android Messages by
Google. Install it and, when it is first
opened, it will set itself as the default
messaging app. All your messages are
imported and you can use the new
Android Messages app instead of
the app installed by your phone’s
manufacturer.
To switch back at any time, open
Android Messages, go to Settings
and tap ‘Default SMS app’. Select the
app you want to use from the list.
This can also be done from within
the phone’s settings. Open Settings,
tap Applications, then ‘Default
applications’. One of the options is
to set the default text-messaging app.
Express iPhone emotions
Messages between iPhones can
include animations created in the
Messages app. Open a conversation
and tap the icon next to the text box
showing a heart with two fingers.
This opens a panel at the bottom.
Tap with two fingers to send an
animated kiss or long press with
two fingers to send an animated
heart beating.
Click the up arrow in the bottom-
right corner and the whole screen can
be used to draw on, like a sketchpad.
Tap a colour and draw with your
finger. When you’ve finished, the
message is sent as an animation and
the recipient will see your drawing
appear on their screen.
Change the look of
WhatsApp messages
When sending a message to
someone, you might want to
emphasise certain words or phrases.
Type an asterisk to make the text
following it bold and then type
another asterisk to return to normal
– for example, *love*. To make
words italic, use an underscore in the
same way; and to make words both
bold and italic, enter an asterisk
followed by an underline, then type
your text and enter underline asterisk
after to return to normal – for
example, *_love_*.
To use strikethrough, enter a tilde
(~) before and after the text: ~love~.
WhatsApp has two slightly different
fonts and you can switch from one to
the other with a secret code. Just
surround the text with three single
quotes (’’’). It’s easy to do but there
are two quote symbols and you must
use the correct one. On Android tap
the Sym button to switch keyboard,
then tap 1/2 to switch to a third
keyboard with more symbols. Tap the
tick in the top-left corner three times.
Enter some text, then add three more
ticks to change back.
Get delivery reports
Have you ever sent a
message and heard nothing
back? You could be worried that the
person didn’t receive it, hasn’t read it
or is deliberately ignoring you.
Delivery reports solve this problem.
On an Android device, open the
Messages app and press More.

SOFTWARE
Avoid future PC problems
Q
My old PC became so slow and
clunky that it was practically
useless, so I bought a 15in laptop from
Dell. Is there anything I can do to stop
my new computer going the same way
after a couple of years of use?
Brian Prado, via email
A
One of the main causes behind
computers slowing down over
time is the software installed on them.
Every application you install adds to the
system’s workload. If the application
loads components in the background,
it uses memory and processing power,
which leaves less for other applications.
Even when you uninstall software,
files are sometimes left behind.
To keep your new computer running
speedily, avoid installing software and,
whenever possible, use portable
applications instead. These are provided
as ZIP files or executable programs that
extract the files and save them to the
hard drive, but they have less impact on
the performance of the PC and are more
easily removed if you decide you don’t
want them. There are lots of portable
programs available at PortableApps
(portableapps.com) but you can get
them from plenty of other places, too.
Each new version of Windows requires

Check your HP battery is safe
Q
I was told that some HP Pavilion
laptops have faulty batteries, so
I went to HP’s website (bit.ly/batt421),
and downloaded a file that checks for
problems (HPBRCULauncher.exe).
When I clicked Save, Run it told me that
HPBRCULauncher.exe is safe. Have
I done the right thing?
Darren, via email

There have been problems with
batteries in a variety of devices,
from mobile phones to laptops. In rare
cases, they can even catch fire so it’s
a good idea to keep an eye out for
manufacturers recalling suspect units.
HP’s tool checks whether the battery in
your laptop is part of a batch that has
been identified as potentially faulty.
You’ve done the right thing in checking
the battery, and every HP laptop owner
should do the same.

Fix a freezing computer
Q
My computer freezes at least once
every few days. When it happens, I
can’t click anything, close any programs
or even restart the PC – I have to hold
down the power button until it switches

memory, processor or other component
is failing? If so, can it be repaired?
C Hogan, via email
A
There are a number of things you
can try before worrying about
hardware repairs. One problem that
often affects old computers is a build-up
of dust clogging the fans and coating
components. You probably have a fan

There’s a hidden reset command
that can fix this problem. Go to

in the list of applications and click it.
Right-click Command Prompt and
select More, then ‘Run as

Another method is to reinstall

Gary Webb, via email
A
Windows used to include the
software to play DVDs, but this was
removed in Windows 10, which means
you now need to install DVD-player
software separately. Microsoft Windows
DVD Player is an option, but it costs
£11.59 in the Windows Store and has
quite a low rating. We recommend VLC
(www.videolan.org), which is a popular,
free media player that supports a wide
range of discs and media file types.
air and use it to blow away the dust.
Many computer problems are caused
by software bugs and removing or
updating the offending program can
often stop your PC freezing. Start by
updating Windows. Go to Windows
Update in the Control Panel or Settings
app and check for updates. If you use
Windows 7, you may also see optional
updates. Install those, too.
Next, check all your installed software
for updates. Some programs have
a menu option to check for updates,
or you may need to visit the developer’s
website. For example, Microsoft releases
an update for Office every month,
which you’ll find at bit.ly/offup421.
Drivers are another common cause of
freezes and should be updated to the
latest versions. We’d recommend using
a driver update tool such as IObit Driver
Booster Free (bit.ly/driverb421) but take
care when installing it that you don’t opt
into any offers for extra software.
Update one driver at a time, and make
sure the PC is working properly before
you update the next one.
INTERNET
Get a better broadband deal
Q
I pay just under £30 a month for
unlimited fast fibre broadband but
I’m at work all day and only use it for
a couple of hours in the evening after
dinner. This seems like a lot of money
to pay for two hours of internet use a
day. Is there any solution? Does such
a thing as evening internet exist?
Dave Miller, via email
A
It’s annoying, but the same applies
if you pay for a TV subscription –
you watch TV for a couple of hours
in the evening and the rest of the day
you are either at work or asleep.
Ask yourself whether you need such
a fast internet connection. Some plans
offer 17Mbps connections for £20 or
less, which would save you £10 a month.
If you’re the only person at home using
the internet, 17Mbps is fast enough for
browsing the web and streaming video
to a single device.
There are also savings to be made
with all-in-one deals that provide
internet, telephone and TV. Go to
uSwitch (www.uswitch.com) to

Q
I’m going abroad for
my summer holiday
this year, and I don’t know
if I’ll be able to get English
TV or Netflix. If I sign up
for a VPN, will I be able to access
Netflix? Could I connect to a UK
server and pretend I’m still at home?
Robert Gaffney, via email
A
In theory, yes. VPN services have
servers in lots of countries,
including the UK. However, the BBC,
Netflix and other broadcasters don’t
always have the rights to distribute
programmes and movies worldwide,
so they have to limit where they can
be viewed. The security systems for
these services may still stop you
watching from abroad.
A better option is to download
programmes before you go. BBC
iPlayer, Netflix, All 4 and others allow
you to download movies and TV
shows. Visit each app’s settings and
choose to download in standard
resolution rather than HD to reduce
the size of the files so you can fit more
on your devices.
A VPN is still useful for the extra
security it provides while you’re
abroad. It encrypts the internet
connection from your PC so no one
can spy on you while you use the
public Wi-Fi in hotels and cafés.

Hold back the Creators
Update
With the old saying “If it isn’t broken,
don’t fix it” in mind, you may want to put
off downloading the Windows 10
Creators Update, if you haven’t already
installed it. It may or may not be
compatible with your PC. Who knows?
I’m playing safe and putting off
upgrading, at least till I know it’s bug-free.
One way to do this is to set your
internet connection as metered. This tells
Windows that your bandwidth is limited
and not to download anything big, such
as the Creators Update. Open Settings,
click Network & Internet, select WiFi and
click the network connection on the right.
Turn on ‘Set as metered connection’.
Another way to put off updates is to
change the active hours. Open Settings
and click ‘Update & security’. Select
Windows Update and click Change
active hours. Set the active hours to
cover the time you use the PC. For
example, 10am to 10pm. Updates won’t

Print lists of files
If you have a lot of photos, music, videos
or other files, you may want to create a
list of them, and perhaps print it. Here’s
how to do it in Windows 10. Open the
folder in Explorer and click File, then
‘Open command prompt’ or Open
Windows PowerShell, depending on the
one you have. At the prompt, type dir
>FileList.txt and press Enter. To list
everything in the folder and subfolders,
type dir /s >FileList.txt.
The result is a text file called FileList.txt,
which you’ll find in the folder you started
working from. Open it in Notepad and
you can print it from there. If there’s too
much information for you, try typing
dir /s /b >FileList.txt, which
strips out a lot of the data.
You can use the same commands in
other versions of Windows but you need
to make sure you’re in the correct folder.

Check how your Facebook
profile appears to the public
If you’ve ever posted in a public group or
page on Facebook, you may be worried
about how much of your profile others
can see when they click your name. The
easiest way to check this is to load your
profile (by clicking your name in the top
toolbar), then click the three-dot button
on your cover photo and select View As.
By default, this page shows how your
profile appears to a random member of
public, but you can also click ‘View as
Specific Person’ and enter the name of
anyone on your friends list to see how
your profile appears to them. If there’s
something on your profile that you don’t
want to be publicly visible, load your
profile normally, click the down-arrow
next to the timestamp of the post you
want to change and pick one of the
available options. The ‘Friends except…’
and ‘Specific friends’ can both be very
handy, but they’re best used when you
first create a post rather than
retrospectively.
Bear in mind that posts will be visible
to people who are tagged in a post
(and their friends), even if you’re not
friends with them.

Generally speaking, your PC should
be fine. Updates sometimes fix bugs
in the operating system and make it run
better, but they can also make it worse!
They patch security vulnerabilities, too,
but if you never connect to the internet
this shouldn’t be much of a concern.
At some point, you may want to install
a new application that requires a
particular version of Windows 10, such as
the forthcoming Creators Update. If so,
you could download the update and
transfer it using a USB memory drive or
simply connect your PC to the internet
temporarily (although the downloads
would take a long time). You’ll find the

What’s the best free video
editor?
Q
Recently, whenever I’ve tried to
watch videos that a friend of mine

distorts badly even though it plays
perfectly well on his computer. He has
been editing his videos with Movie Maker

a different video editor. What’s the best
free alternative?
The Badger, Web User Forums
A
Do you mean the best free video-
editing software or the easiest?
The two are not the same – and, of
course, they’re largely subjective, too.
One of the most powerful editors is
Lightworks Free (www.lwks.com), but it’s
not the best choice for inexperienced
users because it has a pretty steep
learning curve. In Web User Issue 412,
(bit.ly/webuser412), VSDC (www.
videosoftdev.com) was recommended as
a full-featured video editor, which comes
with a handy guide to getting started,
as well as online tutorial videos to help
you learn the techniques.
One of the easiest tools to use is
undoubtedly YouTube’s online editor
(www.youtube.com/editor). You’ll have
to upload all your original files to the site
to edit them, but once you’ve done that,
it’s easy to trim and combine them. You
can see the list of features YouTube’s
editor offers at bit.ly/features421.

Stop charging us for the
same product
In response to your Star Email in Issue
419, ‘Download restrictions encourage
piracy’, my biggest beef with the movie
and recording industry is this: how many
times am I supposed to
pay for the same
product?
In the Sixties,
I bought music
by The Beatles
on vinyl records.
Then eight-track
cartridges came
along and, later,
cassettes and CDs
– all media that were
eventually superseded as the formats
changed over the years. Now it seems
I’m supposed to go online and pay again.
The same is true of ﬁlms and TV
programmes, and yet the industry and
artists still complain that they’re not
making money. Well, let’s see, why don’t
they just change the format again? VHS,
DVD, Blu-ray? I can’t wait to buy It’s a
Wonderful Life in 4K so that everyone
can collect more royalties and I can pay
for the same ﬁlm yet again. Or maybe
I should just pirate the ﬁlm. Under the
circumstances, it’s easy to see why this
prospect is so tempting.

Why the Nokia 3310 is
a smart phone
Both you and your sister
magazine have written about the
new Nokia 3310, and although
the articles were good, the
writers didn’t like the phone’s
limited capabilities. However,
there is one use that both
publications missed: the phone
can be Bluetooth-enabled.
I’ve used Bluetooth to connect
a cheap £20 mobile to my more
expensive smartphone. You can
use it with or without a SIM,
I expect, but mine doesn’t have
one. The advantage of this
arrangement is that I can keep
the cheap phone close to hand
while my smartphone is in a safer
place. When the smartphone
rings, the cheap phone rings too
– via Bluetooth. This means, for
example, that a tradesman could
keep his smartphone looking
smart and use the Nokia when
his hands were not so clean.

hen the question of
whether or not you can
copy music legally was
finally settled sometime last year,
I believe the answer was: “No, you
can’t”. One result of this, I believe,
was that the music-storage box
manufacturer Brenan had to
change its advertising because it
might have been encouraging
people to copy music to Brenan
players direct from CDs.
I use Google Play Music
Manager, as I assume thousands of
other readers do too. This allows me
to access music that’s already on my
computer from the cloud. As well as
encouraging me to buy streamed
Copyright infringement is a confusing issue
music, this is an inducement for me
to copy my CDs to my hard drive.
By transferring my music from my
computer to Music Manager’s cloud
server (from which I can later
access it on my phone or tablet),
isn’t Google implicated in some
aspect of a copyright offence?
It may be that Music Manager
copies only a reference to the
music, which it then uses to play
tracks from its own database, but
given the amount of time it takes
to upload to the cloud, I suspect
the company has actual copies of
the music on my hard drive.
I hope I don’t sound like a
grumpy pedant, and I certainly
don’t wish Google any harm. It’s just
that this law is so ridiculous, I wonder
how far it actually reaches.

Give more space to paid-for
app reviews
I have been a subscriber to your
magazine for some time now and have
found it both interesting and valuable.
I have come to trust the advice given.
I appreciate that space for app reviews
is limited but you allocate much less
space per app to
your ‘5 Apps
Worth Paying For’
than to the main
Best Free Apps.
As a consequence,
when I purchased
the Discover
Britain’s Gardens
app, which you
recommended in
Issue 419, I was
disappointed to ﬁnd that my own
region, the North West, doesn’t feature
in it, and that the app is reissued three
times a year. The current release covers
only events during the winter period, so
it’s understandably rather ‘thin’. What’s
more, when I bought the app, it had only
a month left to run. Neither of these
points was mentioned in your review.
I missed Google Play’s two-hour
deadline for a refund, so I’ve contacted
the developers in the hope that they will
be reasonable. However, I have now
learned that I should seek a second
opinion before leaping into purchases on
the basis of your app recommendations.
Perhaps you could at least give your
paid-for recommendations as much
space as the free ones. Maybe then the
reviews would be a little more thorough.

Thoughts on Iris and
ImgBurn
Your review of Iris
(iristech.co) in the
Best Free Software
section of Issue
419 correctly
points out that
the program
intelligently
changes your
screen’s hue to
match your environment and the time
of day. What you failed to mention is
that the main reason for Iris’s existence
is to eliminate screen ﬂicker caused
by the rapid switching on and off of
the backlight LEDs, which controls the
brightness in most monitors. This ﬂicker
may not be visible to most PC users, but
it does exist and can cause problems.
For some people, myself included,
this results in severe eye strain and
headaches. Also, although Iris is free,
there is a paid-for version, Iris Pro, that
provides greater control over various
settings. There is also a Mac version.
On a separate topic, you gave a
thumbs-down to ImgBurn in the same
section. By pure coincidence, I have used
this tool three times in the past week to
burn ISO images to a DVD, and I ﬁnd that
it does exactly what I need. The main
screen displays the tasks it can perform
in a form that’s easy to understand, and
the program created my bootable DVDs
in no time and without any fuss. The
main screen of the recommended

Online privacy is a human
right
Regarding all the
reports about the
government
wanting to break
end-to-end
encryption so
they can read our
personal
messages [see
FAQ on page 36]. Some people say:
“If you’re not doing anything illegal, you
have nothing to worry about”, but I think
this misses the point. It’s not about
trying to hide stuff from the authorities,
it’s about human rights. What right has
anyone got to intercept my private
communication under the pretence of
trying to protect the country? Also, how
is it even practical to monitor every
message sent by everybody in the UK
every day? It will surely cost billions, and
no doubt us taxpayers will be expected
to foot the bill.
If the government does win the right
to spy on WhatsApp messages, it will
only drive people to use other, lesser-
known services in order to protect their
privacy, as well as Dark Web tools such
as Tor that are harder to crack. Why let
a few idiot terrorists ruin things for
everyone else?

Please don’t ban Kindles on
ﬂights
I sincerely hope that the ban of
electronic devices on planes isn’t
extended beyond ﬂights from Middle
Eastern countries. My Amazon Kindle
is my most valued travel companion and
I shudder at the thought of having to
spend four or
ﬁve hours in
the air
without it.
Yes, I’m aware
of an
invention
called ‘books’,
but lugging
around a
1,000-page
paper brick
feels
unnatural and
unwieldy to
me now, and
I much prefer
the portability
and convenience of a Kindle. Not to
mention the fact that it can store
thousands of books, in case you fancy
a break from the one you’re reading.
Personally, I think it’s ridiculous
that the terrorist threat is robbing us
of the freedom to use our electronic
devices on planes. Surely there’s just
as much risk of a rigged laptop or
tablet exploding in the hold as there
is in the cabin. And I think a terrorist
would have to be some sort of technical
genius to turn a Kindle into a bomb.
However, it’s not my area of expertise
so maybe the security experts in the
government know best. I certainly won’t
be leaving my Kindle at home, though.

RX 470 and gave it a Gold Award.
When I follow the Amazon link
(bit.ly/470amd416), the graphics card
pictured on the website is different to
the one featured in the magazine.
Can you help me identify which
graphics card this is so that I can be sure
to buy the one you recommended?
Mark Malekpour, via email
Web User says: As we were going to
press with that issue, the graphics card
we reviewed was updated to a newer
version with a faster processor and
fewer fans. This means it isn’t exactly
the same as the card we reviewed, but
it’s the next version up and is identical
in practically every other way. The
improvements should mean it’s faster
and draws less power, so it’s an even
better buy overall, even though it’s
ever so slightly more expensive.
Fat cats don’t care about us
Barry is right to criticise fat cats in his
column in Issue 419, but he’s wrong if he
thinks it’s only in the tech industry that
company bosses are remunerated for
their
incompetence.
Sadly,
departing
CEOs are
almost always
rewarded with
huge payoffs,
even if their
tenure was
deemed
unsuccessful
and provided
poor service to customers. Rail bosses,
banking executives, NHS chiefs – they all
take the money and run, without a
thought for those of us who have
suffered due to their poor decisions and
sloppy management. In fact, I read the
other day that by any given lunchtime
the CEOs of the companies in the FTSE
100 have earned as much as the average
worker in the UK earns all year.
With ineffectual government
regulation and a general indifference
to the needs of the public when there’s
money to be made, I can’t see the
situation changing any time soon. That’s
a pity, because these thoughtless, greedy
fat cats always get away scot-free with
their wallets bulging.

HOULD THE LAW BE
CHANGED TO STOP
SERVICES SUCH AS WHATSAPP
USING END-TO-END
ENCRYPTION?
No. The Government spies on us too
much already. It’s all for our own
good, of course! Not.
Iain Kenworthy-Neale
Encryption is just maths. You can’t
ban it. It exists. You can ban
WhatsApp, but what will that do,
apart from upset everyone who uses it
to avoid extortionate MMS charges?
Andrew Duerden
The Government already has
far-reaching mass surveillance
powers. The arguments against
breaking end-to-end encryption
haven’t changed.
Bobby Moss @bob_moss
So because one nutter used
WhatsApp, we must ban end-to-end
encryption! He used a car as a
weapon, too, so will they ban cars and
make us travel on public transport?

SAMSUNG’S NEW GALAXY S8?
No, but the price tag does. I currently
use a Galaxy S7 Edge, and switching
isn’t an option. I’m on a SIM-only deal
to keep the monthly costs down, but
who can afford the minimum of £650
for the S8 alone?

I have a Samsung A5. I haven’t been

I am put off by the cost, however.
I could buy a 4K TV for that money.

Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
thieves, terrorists and oppressive
regimes who want access to private
messages, too. But then judging by her
performance on Marr, the Home
Secretary doesn’t seem to understand
much about
technology at all.
“We’re not
saying open up,
we don’t want to
go into the
cloud,” said Rudd,
talking of “the
cloud” as if it’s a
shady nightclub in Damascus. “I would
ask [Apple CEO] Tim Cook to think
again about other ways with helping us
work out how we can get into situations
like WhatsApp on the Apple phone,” she
added. “It’s not necessarily Apple itself,
sometimes it’s WhatsApp and the other
situations on it.” Yes, we’ve all installed
those ‘situations’ on our phone, and
suddenly found ourselves in an awkward
conversation with Jihadi John.
Barry Collins offers to help the Home
Secretary with her tech teething problems
Page 404
Still, Rudd’s not stopping there. She’s
going to demand Google takes down
websites publishing terrorist manuals
– seemingly confusing a search engine
with web hosts – and then, best of all,
she’s going to meet
with “the best
people who
understand the
technology, who
understand the
necessary
hashtags”. Perhaps
they could start with
#CluelessHomeSecretary?
Now, of course, it’s very easy for me
to sit here with 20 years of experience in
technology and poke fun at the Home
Secretary, in exactly the same way it’s
far too easy for someone with a career
spent in investment banking and
recruitment to be put in charge of the
country’s anti-terrorism unit. Which is
why, having watched her stumbling
television appearance, I tweeted the
following:
“Genuine offer to @AmberRudd_MP:
I’ll get a group of internet/security
experts together to brief you properly,
so you don’t repeat #Marr.”
I wasn’t expecting a reply. But a day
later, when having read my message
and made a similar offer of his own,
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales
retweeted the message, I thought it
might at least pique some interest. After
all, he runs the fifth biggest website in
the world. He’s bound to know all the
necessary hashtags.
So, I repeat the offer here, safe in the
knowledge that at least one
Conservative MP reads this column
(Hi Grant!). One hour with me, Jimmy
and the best experts I can find: free of
charge. Hit me on WhatsApp if you’re
up for it, Amber.
Break encryption for the
security services and you also
break it for thieves, terrorists
and oppressive regimes
T
errorism today, well it’s just not
cricket. “It used to be that people
used to steam open envelopes
or just listen into phones when
they wanted to ﬁnd out what people
were doing,” the Home Secretary
lamented to Andrew Marr, days after the
recent terror attack in Westminster. Now
companies such as WhatsApp and Apple
are providing a “secret place for
terrorists to communicate”. What’s a
spook supposed to do?
Yes, despite any credible evidence
that the terrible events in Westminster
were planned over WhatsApp or
iMessage, the Home Secretary and a
vengeful media have got it in for
encrypted-messaging services.
To be clear, Amber Rudd doesn’t want
to ban encrypted messages, she just
wants the spooks to have access to
them. She doesn’t understand that
effectively amounts to the same thing
– break encryption for the security
services and you also break it for the
