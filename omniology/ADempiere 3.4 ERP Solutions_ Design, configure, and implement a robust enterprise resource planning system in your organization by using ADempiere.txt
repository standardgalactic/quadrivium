Preface
In the past seven years, as the author was starting his journey with the 
manufacturing and the services industries, he found that many tasks in these 
industries involved back offices using manual efforts. These industries made use 
of spreadsheet applications or implemented their own specific solution. Each of 
the departments such as Production, Purchasing, Accounting, and so on created 
their own data and often had a different figure on the same subject when preparing 
business reports. This led to extra efforts required when creating an analysis report.
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a system that integrates all of the functions, 
in each of the departments, into a single system that is designed to encapsulate all 
of business processes getting involved. With the existence of an open source ERP 
package, there is an option for an organization to manage their data in a centralized 
way, working with the same data and get the benefit with data integrity and can 
create business reports more accurately and faster.
ERP systems are essential in today's business market. There are many options for 
ERP systems; however, ADempiere offers a solid foundation for developing a 
powerful ERP system that helps your business to manage data efficiently, streamline 
different processes, at affordable costs, and improve the efficiency levels without too 
much complexity.
The ADempiere project was established and created on September 2006. ADempiere 
is a friendly fork of the Compiere ERP. The ADempiere community expected to use 
a proven platform, taking care of and listening to the customers' needs and feedback, 
and create a project that was community-driven and used General Public License 
(GPL) as its license; thus providing the freedom to extend its feature and capabilities.
From its inception, ADempiere attracted great attention from all over the world. 
According to the SourceForge.net download statistics for the year of 2009, there 
have been more than ten thousand downloads, as evident from sourceforge.net.

About this book
This practical book offers a comprehensive understanding of ADempiere, and 
takes a look at the main features by way of developing and enhancing a sample 
case study from concept to deployment. This book will help you model complex 
business processes with ease.
You will learn to install ADempiere, followed by configuring the company structure 
and the initial client setup. You can start working with ADempiere immediately 
because this book will get you up and running quickly, and assumes no prior 
knowledge or experience of working with ADempiere. ADempiere 3.4 ERP Solutions 
enables you to: set up the accounting parts, define the prerequisite data, learn about 
product and price management, and perform procurement and sales activities. When 
you read the book, you'll understand the concept behind the ADempiere workflow 
and the important function of managing inventory. Activities such as making 
user-defined financial reports, procedures for importing data, and security 
considerations will be covered in detail, and you will also partly learn about 
the application dictionary configuration.
ADempiere generates accounting facts or journals automatically. In this book, you 
will understand the impact of these accounting facts. This book will provide you 
with a comprehensive study of how to easily implement ADempiere and make 
the best use of this open source ERP system.
To understand the content of this book thoroughly, it is suggested that readers 
learn and practice the topics sequentially from Chapter 1 through Chapter 10. 
The remaining chapters can be read and implemented as references.
What this book covers
In Chapter 1: ADempiere Installation, you will be introduced to the hardware 
requirements, obtaining ADempiere and prerequisite applications, installing and 
setting up PostgreSQL databases, applying patches, and verifying the ADempiere 
server and client. Throughout the book, we will use Microsoft Windows as the 
operating system.
In Chapter 2: Exploring the ADempiere Client and Performing Tasks, you will learn the 
connection aspect of ADempiere, how to identify the ADempiere version, predefined 
user IDs, standard format of the ADempiere client user interface, and standard 
command and functions to perform tasks (including Record Info and the field 
context menu).

Preface
[  ]
In Chapter 3: Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup, you will 
create and map a fictitious apparel company structure. In this chapter, you will be 
introduced to standard ADempiere company structures, preparing chart of accounts 
which are required during the initial client creation, creating a new client (company), 
and finally, you will set up and review organizations, warehouses, and locators. You 
will also be introduced to Accounting Schema, Calendar Year and Period, and the 
Accounting Processor features of ADempiere.
In Chapter 4: Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration, before 
you start working with ADempiere, you need to set up some master or reference 
data in the system. For all of the basic or data references, it has a standard accounting 
configuration. This chapter shows you how the accounting related configuration 
takes part. With this information, we can configure and alter the default account 
for an account related with master or references data. With this basic accounting 
configuration, you will be introduced to managing the customer and the vendor 
(business partner), managing company financial management including the 
company bank and cash books. We conclude this chapter with managing 
currencies, price management, and product management.
In Chapter 5: Procurement Activities with the prerequisites and preconfigured data 
at hand, you will continue with the creation of a sample procurement flow. Before 
producing finished goods in the apparel company, we will define the raw materials 
required (to produce these finished goods). Then you will learn how to accomplish 
an order requisition, purchase order, material receipt, vendor invoice, vendor 
payment, and also how to reconcile a bank statement. To learn the General Ledger 
journal created, we will perform some tasks and generate the accounting facts.
In Chapter 6: Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities, you will be explained 
landed cost (for example, we show how to handle transportation charges), which is 
allocated and assigned to raw materials. You will configure the bill of material and 
learn how to manufacture finished goods. With the available finished goods, you will 
create quotations, sales orders, shipments, invoices, AR receipts, and also reconcile a 
bank statement. In this chapter, you will also learn how the General Ledger journal is 
automatically generated by the ADempiere system.
In Chapter 7: Accounting Information and Configuration, you will learn about the 
central accounting configuration in ADempiere. You will learn how to manage the 
Account Element (list of company accounts). You will also learn the Accounting 
Schema in more detail, and will have a hands-on experience of what the effects of 
modifying the configuration are. An example of how to avoid the Intercompany 
Due/To journal, avoid the product inventory clearing journal, commitment 
accounting, and configuring GL distribution will also be shown. At the end of 
this chapter, Product Cost will be explained.

Preface
[  ]
In Chapter 8: Managing Inventory, you will learn about the various product attributes 
(for example, registering lot number, color, and so on) and how to work with these 
attributes. This chapter will guide you through the setup of attribute information, 
for both raw materials and finished goods. We will continue our discussion with 
managing internal use of the inventory, managing physical inventory that can be 
used to perform stock counting, and a way to migrate the existing material. We'll 
also discuss about how to perform inventory movement with or without creating 
a confirmation while receiving the material.
In Chapter 9: ADempiere Workflow, you will learn about how all the ADempiere 
documents, such as Purchase Requisition, Purchase Order, MM Receipt, and so 
on, implement the workflow by default. We'll discuss the workflow concept and 
give some examples on how to implement document process, document value, and 
general workflow. Through these examples, we'll guide you on how to perform the 
approval procedure with the help of the document process workflow. You can notify 
certain people through e-mail if needed. While running a document workflow, we 
can monitor the workflow progress or even cancel the workflow. You will be guided 
on how to perform these tasks.
In Chapter 10: Reporting Management, you will be introduced to the Reports and Print 
features. This chapter will explain what a print format is and how to set up a default 
print format for a document such as Purchase Order. You will also be informed 
about how the ADempiere window finds its print format template. You will learn 
how to customize standard reports by altering the logo, header layout, and detail 
layout. As an organization has its unique list of accounts, we will conclude this 
chapter by showing how to create and configure our own financial reports, which 
can be used to measure the organization's performance.
In Chapter 11: Importing Data, you will learn about the importing mechanism 
through ADempiere. This will involve activities, such as determining import loader 
format, preparing the data source, loading the data, and conclude with the importing 
activities. Based on the predefined loader format, you can practice preparing source 
files and importing business partners, products, currency rates, GL journals, Orders, 
Invoices, Inventories, and Bank Statements.
In Chapter 12: Implementing Security, you will finish this book by learning how 
ADempiere security works. You will be guided through managing user IDs and 
creating roles. While constructing a role, you will see the various attributes involved, 
such as access all orgs, maintain change log, and so on. Here, you will learn how 
to assign rights to access a window, identify a process, and give rights to it, how to 
register document access, and manage form access. Then, with an example, we will 
show you how to perform the access security rule for records, how to restrict access 
to tables, columns, reports, and export facilities. We will conclude this chapter by 
showing you  the process of obscuring information in ADempiere.

ADempiere Installation
In order to establish a new company or monitor an existing company, we should 
take into consideration every aspect of the company. One aspect is to make the entire 
company operation run effectively.
If we are planning to implement Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems 
(or any other Computer Automation System) for our company, then we will come 
across many solutions or options for commercial and open source ERP packages.
Moreover, for a small or medium-sized company, implementing a commercial or 
proprietary ERP system will be costly. A huge amount of money will be spent on 
both application and consultancy. So, the question is—"Is there an alternative to 
fulfill our company's needs and run the operations effectively at an affordable price?"
ADempiere (http://www.adempiere.com/wiki) is an open source ERP application 
that is community driven, evolving, and that provides amazing features such as (but not 
limited to) purchasing, material receipts, sales, shipment, inventory, simple manufacturing, 
advanced accounting, and so on. 
These should be more than enough to cover a small or medium-sized 
company's needs.
In this chapter, you will be introduced to the following:
Hardware and operating system requirements for ADempiere
Obtaining ADempiere and the prerequisite applications
Installing and setting up PostgreSQL database
Installing and running ADempiere
We will start our activities after learning about the hardware and operating 
system requirements.

ADempiere Installation
[ 10 ]
ADempiere hardware and operating 
system requirements
Using Java (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) 
as its core programming language, ADempiere can run on a Java-supporting 
platform or machine and operating system. Examples of the Java-supporting 
platforms are Solaris and Intel, or any AMD-based architecture machine. Operating 
systems that can be used, based on the platform, are Solaris OS, Linux, BSD, Mac 
OS, and Microsoft Windows. Visit http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/system-
configurations.html for further references.
ADempiere should be installed on both the server as well as client computers. The 
requirements for installation on both types will be different. On the client side, it can 
be run on a computer that has an old Pentium 4 processor or a higher specification 
with at least a GB of memory. For a server computer, we can use the Pentium 
Dual-Core processor with 2 GB of memory.
This is just an example of hardware requirements in an 
Intel-based architecture machine. You can choose various 
brands of servers and desktops that are available in the 
market that suit your needs.
However, computer hardware requirements depend on the load and daily usage 
prediction level of the application. For internal testing and practice of the ADempiere 
features described in this book, both the ADempiere server and client system can be 
installed on a computer with low specifications, such as a PC-based computer, 
or even your modern-day notebook.
Installing the Sun Java Development Kit 
(JDK)
All applications, that are written in Java programming language including ADempiere, 
require a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for execution. The JVM is distributed along 
with a standard Java class library that implements the Java Application Programming 
Interface (API). A complete implementation of JVM is included in the Java Runtime 
Environment (JRE), which can be obtained during the installation of the Java 
Development Kit (JDK) or by installing Java Runtime Environment.
www.allitebooks.com

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
Obtaining JDK/JRE
ADempiere can be installed on any operating system—Mac OS, Linux, BSD families, 
and so on, but in this book we will use Microsoft Windows as the operating system.
You can download the latest JDK/JRE available from the Sun Microsystems 
website at http://java.sun.com/. Throughout this book, JDK 5.0 will be used 
as a prerequisite for installing ADempiere. We can download JDK 5.0 from 
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp. At the time of 
writing this book, the latest version or release for JDK 5.0 is JDK 5.0 Update 17. 
Future versions or releases of JDK can also be used without any problems.
Click on the JDK 5.0 Update 17 Download button, and you will be directed to the 
download page. Set the platform as Windows and the language as Multi-Language. 
On the next page, choose Windows Offline Installation. The filename for this JDK 
is jdk-1_5_0_17-windows-i586-p.exe. It is about 52.15 MB in size. In order to 
manage the downloaded files, first create a C:\download\jdk folder, and then save 
the files to this folder.
JDK installation files are required for the ADempiere server installation, but they 
are not necessary for the ADempiere client installation. On the client side, only the 
JRE installation files are needed. To download these files, click on the Java Runtime 
Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 Download button. Select the platform and language 
as mentioned previously, (including the Windows Offline Installation mode). Save 
the jre-1_5_0_17-windows-i586-p.exe file to the C:\download\jdk folder.
Installing JDK/JRE
Due to the default installation behavior of Microsoft Windows, a new application 
installation will commonly be directed to the C:\Program Files folder. An 
important thing when installing JDK and/or JRE on Microsoft Windows is that we 
should avoid installing it to C:\Program Files directly. To avoid any problems 
during the ADempiere implementation, it is recommended that you install it to a 
folder that does not contain spaces in the directory or folder name, such as C:\Java.

ADempiere Installation
[ 12 ]
JDK installation on the ADempiere server computer
Double-click on jdk-1_5_0_17-windows-i586-p.exe to start the Windows installer.
By default, the installer will install development tools, demo files, source code, and 
public JRE. For our reference, leave the Development Tools feature selected and 
deselect the other features by clicking on the buttons on the left-hand side of Demos, 
Source Code, and Public JRE, and then choosing Don't install this feature now. 
This is shown in the following screenshot:
Select Development Tools, click on the Change button to alter the default or target 
directory to C:\Java\jdk1.5.0_17, and proceed to complete the JDK installation.
During the Development Tools installation, a private 
JRE will automatically be installed. In our case, it will be 
installed at C:\Java\jdk1.5.0_17\jre.

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
JRE installation on the ADempiere client computer
The ADempiere client installation requires installation of the Java Runtime 
Environment (JRE) only. Open the link http://java.sun.com/products/archive/
j2se/5.0_17/ and double-click on jre-1_5_0_17-windows-i586-p.exe. At the 
license agreement, ensure that you choose the Custom setup, and click on the Accept 
button. Leave the J2SE Runtime Environment selected, and deselect the other 
features by clicking on the buttons to the left-hand side of Support for Additional 
Languages and Additional Font and Media Support. Choose Don't install this 
feature now. Select J2SE Runtime Environment, click on the Change button to alter 
the default or target directory to C:\Java\jre1.5.0_17, click on the Next button, 
and proceed to complete the JRE installation.
There is no need to install JRE if you are using the same computer for 
both the ADempiere Server and the Client.

ADempiere Installation
[ 14 ]
Configuring Java system variables and the 
Windows path
Now that we have installed JDK/JRE, we have to set up JAVA system variables 
and set Windows paths both for the ADempiere server and the client computer, 
as ADempiere runs on a Java platform.
We need to set these variables in the System Properties window. You can access 
this window through Start | Control Panel | System (or Start | Settings | Control 
Panel | System in the case of the Windows classic menu). Select the Advanced 
system settings tab, and click on the Environment Variables button.
The following table shows the value of a Java system variable and a Windows 
path for the ADempiere server installation to be set up in the Environment 
Variables window:
No
Variable
Value
1
JAVA_HOME
C:\Java\jdk1.5.0_17
2
Path
%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\jre\bin\client
For the ADempiere client installation, you may set the following Java system variable 
and Windows path in the Environment Variables window:
No
Variable
Value
1
JAVA_HOME
C:\Java\jre1.5.0_17
2
Path
%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin\client
The Environment Variables window is shown as follows:
This is an example of System variables in the Environment Variable window from 
the author's computer. It might vary for your own computer's configuration.

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
You can set additional JAVA_HOME variables by clicking on the New button 
in System variables. To set your own JAVA_HOME variables, click on the Edit 
button by selecting an existing path variable entry and enter your additional path 
entries. In order to confirm the addition of system variables, click on OK in both 
the Environment Variable window and the System Properties window.
While setting up the Path variable, any additional variable inclusion in 
these entries must be prefixed with a semicolon (;) character.
Verifying system variables and the 
Windows path
Once we have finished adding the additional variables, we have to check whether 
the setup of the variables was configured properly. We shall check our variables' 
entries from the DOS prompt command line. We can access DOS prompt from 
Start | Run. Type cmd in the Run window, and click on the OK button. We will 
get the following command prompt:
We can type the following in this command line, and Enter:
C:\>SET
Pay attention to the resulting information. On the author's ADempiere server 
computer, it displays the following statements:
JAVA_HOME=C:\Java\jdk1.5.0_17
and
Path=C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\Java\
jdk1.5.0_17\bin;C:\Java\jdk1.5.0_17\jre\bin\client
Whereas the ADempiere client computer will contain the following statements:
JAVA_HOME=C:\Java\jre1.5.0_17
and
Path=C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\Java\
jre1.5.0_17\bin;C:\Java\jre1.5.0_17\bin\client

ADempiere Installation
[ 16 ]
The second procedure for checking the setup configuration is to use Java commands. 
For example, in order to find a command to know what the currently-installed Java 
version is, we can use the following command:
C:\>java -version
and press Enter. This showed the following statements on the author's computer:
java version "1.5.0_17"Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition 
(build 1.5.0_17-b04)Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_17-b04, mixed 
mode, sharing)
Installing databases
ADempiere requires a database to store its data. Currently, ADempiere officially 
supports both Oracle (XE) and PostgreSQL (EnterpriseDB) databases. The databases 
can be installed on the ADempiere server or onto a specific database computer 
server. In this book, we will set these databases up on an ADempiere server.
To support the open source movement, we will use PostgreSQL as our ADempiere 
database backend instead of Oracle. If you want to set up Oracle (XE) as your 
database backend, then visit http://www.adempiere.com/index.php/ADempiere_
Installing for more information.
Obtaining PostgreSQL databases
We can obtain PostgreSQL databases for Microsoft Windows from http://www.
postgresql.org/download/windows. You will find an option to Download the 
one click installer or pgInstaller. Click on Download the one click installer, and 
you will be redirected to the Enterprise DB website: http://www.enterprisedb.
com/products/pgdownload.do#windows. Download the installer for the Microsoft 
Windows operating system.
At the time of writing, the latest release of the PostgreSQL database for Windows 
is PostgreSQL 8.3.5. After we click on the download button on this site, we will be 
prompted to save the postgresql-8.3.5-2-windows.exe file (about 35.7 MB in 
size). Create a C:\download\database folder, and save this binary installation file

Installing PostgreSQL databases
Double-click on the postgresql-8.3.5-2-windows.exe file to launch the Windows 
installer. During the installation, this installer will install additional required files 
for us automatically. It will install Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable. 
When asked for the installation directory, point it to C:\download\database\
postgresql\8.3, instead of the default installation directory, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
We will refer to C:\download\database\postgresql\8.3 
as %PostgreSQLHome% throughout this book.
Click on Next, and you will be prompted with the data directory location 
confirmation. You can define your own data directory or location. On the 
author's computer, the data directory is left as it is—C:\download\database\
PostgreSQL\8.3\data. Next, set a password for your Postgres account. In this 
installation, we use postgres as the default password for the Postgres account. 
Beware of your Caps Lock status. Ensure that you use lowercase 
while typing your password.
Leave the default Port used for this database as 5432, set Locale to English, United 
States, and proceed to complete your database installation.
On the final installation screen, you need to deselect the Launch Stack Builder 
at exit option.
Adding the PostgreSQL path
The PostgreSQL database server for ADempiere has been successfully installed. 
During ADempiere installation, there are many PostgreSQL application tools 
(*.exe files) that can help you to manage your database. Most of these tools 
can be found in the %PostgreSQLHome%\bin folder.

ADempiere Installation
[ 18 ]
Examples of these application tools are given in the following table:
No
Tools name
Description
1
psql.exe
Tools for executing interactive PostgreSQL commands
2
createuser.exe
Tools for creating PostgreSQL users
3
createdb.exe
Tools for creating PostgreSQL databases
These tools will be used throughout this book. In order to add these folders to our 
Path System variables, do the following:
1.	 Access the System Properties window via Start | Control Panel | System.
2.	 Select the Advanced tab, and then click on the Environment Variables button.
3.	 Edit the Path system variable, and add the following entry: 
;C:\download\database\PostgreSQL\8.3\bin
While editing the Path system variable, do not forget to add a 
semicolon (;) before the folder name! 
Verifying the additional PostgreSQL path
Just like we verified the Java system variables, we should verify our PostgreSQL 
path. Previously, we used the SET command to accomplish this task. We shall use 
the path command to verify the path.
Open the DOS prompt command-line window and type:
C:\>path
Press Enter, and the system will display the current computer PATH. Ensure that we 
have C:\database\PostgreSQL\8.3\bin in the contents of PATH. The following is 
the screenshot from the author's computer:

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
The next procedure is to verify the additional PostgreSQL paths. Type the psql 
command on the command line, and press Enter. If we are prompted to enter a 
password, then our PostgreSQL path setting is working as expected. Press Enter, 
and the system will display the following information:
psql: fe_sendauth: no password supplied
This message appears because psql cannot proceed, because 
no user password was supplied.
Thus, we have completed the database installation and verification.
Configuring PostgreSQL
By default, the initial security configuration settings to access PostgreSQL 
databases are quite restrictive. This is a good practice as we can make sure that our 
databases can be accessed from trusted computers only. We can define an additional 
list of computers that can access our databases by altering some PostgreSQL 
configuration files.
Modifying the client authentication configuration file
The name of the client authentication configuration file is pg_hba.conf. It can be 
found in the %PostgreSQLHome%\data folder. This file contains the information 
shown in the following screenshot:

ADempiere Installation
[ 20 ]
With this configuration, the database connection is accepted from a local 
computer only. If we wish to allow any computer within our local LAN, which 
is pre-installed with the ADempiere client—and let us assume that our computer 
server has a 10.10.101.107 IP address—then we should add the following two 
lines of configuration:
host  adempiere   adempiere  10.10.101.107/0   md5
host  template1   postgres   10.10.101.107/0   md5
to our pg_hba.conf file.
The 10.10.101.107/0 defines the IP and subnet masks allowed. 
Visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork for a 
further explanation. 
Verifying the PostgreSQL configuration file
The other client authentication file is postgresql.conf. It is present in the 
%PostgreSQLHome%\data\ folder. If we go through this file, then we will 
find the following information:
listen_addresses = '*'
The above statement means that the PostgreSQL database for Windows is listening 
and is ready to make a connection with all of the available computer addresses. 
Leave this configuration unchanged, and our client will have a connection without 
any problems.
Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for more detailed information. This 
document can be accessed from Start | All Programs | PostgreSQL 8.3 | 
Documentation (or Start | Programs | PostgreSQL 8.3 | Documentation 
on the Windows classic menu) for more detailed information.
Configuring the firewall to allow database 
connections
For security reasons, the current Microsoft Windows installation's best practice is 
to block all incoming connections to unrecognized ports. We need to tell Microsoft 
Windows which port is being used by the PostgreSQL database by default.

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]
During our PostgreSQL database installation, we used port 5432 as the standard 
database communication port on all of the connected computers within our 
network (including the host or database server itself). We will open this port 
from the Windows firewall, which can be accessed from Start | Control Panel | 
Windows Firewall.
Select the Exception tab, and click on the Add port button. Complete the PostgreSQL 
Name field, and enter 5432 as the Port number. Ensure that you select TCP instead 
of UDP. Click on the OK button.
Installing ADempiere on the server side
All prerequisite applications for ADempiere are now configured properly. It is time 
to install the ADempiere application. A cup of coffee or tea would be refreshing 
before we begin.
Downloading the ADempiere core 
installation files
Currently, all of the ADempiere binary files, source code, and any other files related 
to ADempiere are hosted at http://sourceforge.net/. Throughout this book, we 
will use ADempiere 3.4.2s (as the latest stable version for the 3.4 release series).
We can download this file from http://downloads.sourceforge.net/adempiere/
Adempiere_342s.zip. The installation file is about 99.22 MB. Create the 
C:\download\adempiere folder, and save the file to this folder.
For checking the integrity of our ADempiere installer, we will download 
its MD5 signature. Download the MD5 signature for ADempiere_342s.zip from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/adempiere/files/Adempiere_342s.zip.MD5.
Downloading the latest ADempiere patch files
The ADempiere version 342s was released on December 21st, 2008. After the first 
release, there has always been an effort to fix bugs, and the ADempiere developer 
community has released regular application patch files. Along with these application 
patch files, sometimes the community provides files that need to be applied to the 
ADempiere database, too. We call these files, as migration script files which aim to 
alter the ADempiere database and make it comply with a newer database structure.

ADempiere Installation
[ 22 ]
Obtaining the ADempiere application patch files
ADempiere developer community releases their patch files in the following format:
No
Format name
Description
1
patches_xxxx_yyyymmdd.jar
ADempiere core patches for version xxxx and 
released on the year, month, and date mentioned in 
patch's filename
2
zkpatches_xxxx_yyyymmdd.jar
ADempiere ZK web user interface patches for 
version xxxx and released on the year, month, and 
date mentioned in patch's filename
We can obtain a list of available ADempiere patch files from http://sourceforge.
net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=176962&package_id=230906&release_
id=648627. Here is an example of a list of ADempiere patch files that are 
currently available:
For patch files, we need the latest files for both ADempiere core and 
the ADempiere ZK web user interface.
With this information, we shall download patches_342s_20091110.jar and 
zkpatches_342s_20091110.jar. For verification purposes, we shall download 
patches_342s_20091110.jar.MD5 and zkpatches_342s_20091110.jar.MD5 
also. Put all of the downloaded files in the C:\download\adempiere folder.

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
Obtaining the ADempiere database migration script
To make sure that we are working with the latest ADempiere database structure, 
we need to download the migration script files. These files are standard SQL 
(Structured Query Language) files with .sql as the file extension. The migration 
script provided for PostgreSQL databases is different from the Oracle database 
one. For PostgreSQL databases, you can obtain it from http://adempiere.svn.
sourceforge.net/viewvc/adempiere/branches/adempiere343/migration/
342s-trunk/postgresql/ whereas for Oracle, it's available at http://adempiere.
svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/adempiere/branches/adempiere343/migration/
342s-trunk/.
As this book uses a PostgreSQL database, at the time of writing this book, the 
following list of files were available for download:
372_round.sql
379_FR1883270_NextIdByYear.sql
391_C_Currency_Rate.sql
398_currencyround.sql
413_BF2567104.sql
417_FR2582181.sql
436_MissingSysConfigKeys.sql
441_BF2710889_Add_Months.sql
442_BF2710889_PaymentTermDueDate.sql
443_BF2714803_InvoicepaidToDate.sql
444_BF2714831_InvoiceopenToDate.sql
566_FR1756793_RMA_JUST_FOR_343.sql
Put all of the downloaded files in the C:\download\adempiere\sql folder. We will 
apply these script files later.
Verifying the ADempiere binary files
While downloading, due to the uncertainty of Internet connections, sometimes our 
download files remain in an incomplete state. On the other hand, if we download 
the binary file from an unknown site, there is a possibility that it might be modified 
by somebody out there who wants to introduce security holes! This can lead to an 
unrecognized behavior when trying to proceed further with this file.
To avoid any unnecessary headaches in the near future, we strongly recommend 
that you perform an integrity check and validate your ADempiere binary 
installation files.

ADempiere Installation
[ 24 ]
ADempiere provides us with MD5 signature files on the SourceForge sites. MD5 is 
one of cryptographic methods that can be used for verifying the integrity of files.
For a complete explanation of MD5, you can read http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/MD5.
Fortunately, there are a lot of free tools that can be used to help us check the 
validity of files. One of them is Mat-MD5 (http://www.matsoftware.it/software/
mat-md5). Create the C:\download\tools folder, and then download this tool into 
this folder.
We will now proceed to check the integrity of all of our ADempiere binary 
files, including core files and patch files. As an example, we will try to verify our 
ADempiere_342s.zip files, by performing the following steps:
1.	 Extract the contents of the matmd5_en_10.zip file.
2.	 Double-click on matmd5.exe.
3.	 Click on the Browse button, and point to the C:\download\adempiere\
ADempiere_342s.zip file.
4.	 Click on the Open MD5 file button, and open the C:\download\
adempiere\ADempiere_342s.zip.MD5 file. It will contain a value such as 
0ddb4da70fdf3ee5af227083c6f7fe10 *Adempiere_342s.zip.
5.	 Copy 0ddb4da70fdf3ee5af227083c6f7fe10 into the field Add MD5 sums 
for each file added, and click on the Add button.
If everything goes well, the system will indicate a successful integrity check, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
Otherwise, we need to download the ADempiere binary files again from 
http://sourceforge.net/ and perform another integrity check until the 
files are successfully verified.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
Extracting the ADempiere core installation files
The ADempiere core installation file is Adempiere_342s.zip. This is only a ZIP file 
and not a windows installer. We need to extract the content of the ZIP file to the 
C:\ drive. Navigate to the C:\download\adempiere folder, right-click on this file, 
and click on Extract All. When the system asks about the target directory, point 
it to the C:\ drive. Click on the Next button to extract the files. Your ADempiere 
files should be found in the C:\Adempiere folder. The standard ADempiere folder 
structure is shown in the following screenshot:
Applying the ADempiere application patch files
Applying patch files is an easy task. First, ensure that you back up your 
patches_342s_20091110.jar and zkpatches_342s_20091110.jar files by copying 
them to the C:\download\adempiere\backup folder. Rename the original files in the 
downloaded folder from patches_342s_20091110.jar to patches.jar and from 
zkpatches_342s_20091110.jar to zkpatches.jar.
Before copying the patch files to another folder, it's a good practice to keep a 
backup of the original C:\adempiere\lib\patches.jar and C:\adempiere\
lib\zkpatches.jar files. We shall put these backup files into the C:\download\
adempiere\backup folder as well. The last thing to do is to copy our downloaded 
patches.jar and zkpatches.jar files, which can be found at C:\download\
adempiere, into the C:\adempiere\lib folder.
During the copying procedure, when the system prompts us with a Confirm File 
Replace question, just click on Yes to All, and we will have finished our tasks.

ADempiere Installation
[ 26 ]
Creating an ADempiere PostgreSQL database
ADempiere provides us with an initialized database dump. This file contains a list 
of SQL commands that can be used to create the ADempiere database structure and 
predefined data. The physical name of this file is Adempiere_pg.dmp. We will find 
this file in the C:\Adempiere\data folder.
The C:\Adempiere\data folder will contain two DMP files. These are 
Adempiere.dmp and Adempiere_pg.dmp. The Adempiere.dmp file 
will be used for the Oracle installation, and the Adempiere_pg.dmp file 
will be used for PostgreSQL installation.
Creating a PostgreSQL new login role
While configuring the ADempiere server, a special login role is required, which 
is used internally by ADempiere. We can define additional login roles by using 
the pgAdmin III tools. We can access these tools through Start | All Programs | 
PostgreSQL 8.3 | pgAdmin III.
Double-click on PostgreSQL 8.3 (localhost:5432) in Object browser to connect to 
the PostgreSQL database server. When the system prompts us with the Connect 
to Server window, we will supply our postgres account password and click 
on OK.
During the PostgreSQL databases installation, we provided postgres 
as our postgres account password.
After successfully logging in by using this tool, the system will show a screen similar 
to the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 27 ]
In order to add a new login role, right-click on the Login Roles node, and click on 
New Login Role. Create the role name adempiere with the password adempiere, 
and ensure that the following Role Privileges are selected:
Superuser
Can create database objects
Can create roles
Can modify catalog directly
This role name is the user who was previously configured in the 
Modify client authentication configuration file section.
Creating an ADempiere database
Using the pgAdmin III tools, we will create our new ADempiere database. 
Right-click on the Databases node, and then click on New database in the Object 
browser. Complete the information fields within the Properties tab, as shown 
in the following table:
No
Field
Value
1
Name
adempiere
2
Owner
adempiere
3
Encoding
UTF8
Leave the other information as it is. Click on OK to proceed to the database 
creation procedure.
By default, we will initially have an initial or blank ADempiere 
database due to the previous activities. We need to import the 
ADempiere database structure such as table, view, function, and 
initial data, from the existing database dump file later.
Configuring the ADempiere server
ADempiere needs to be configured on the server side. This task is intended to notify 
ADempiere about predefined variables or information. This information is needed 
by ADempiere to integrate the database, to bind official ADempiere core patches and 
ZK web user interface patches to the ADempiere core application, and to host these 
core packages on their default embedded application server (JBoss).

Leave the other fields unchanged. Click on the Test button in the Adempiere Server 
Setup window. When the system prompts you with the Key Store Dialog window, 
complete the fields with your information, and ensure that the setup window displays 
an Ok message on the bottom-left info bar, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 29 ]
Click on Save to proceed with our ADempiere server installation configuration. 
Carefully read through the ADempiere license agreement window. Accept the terms 
of the agreement, and click on OK once again to start the ADempiere deployment. 
Wait for a moment as the ADempiere system performs its internal tasks to configure 
and build our ADempiere server.
At the end of these tasks, we will get the information shown in the next screenshot, 
which indicates successful packaging and deployment of the application to the 
embedded JBoss application server.
During the Test procedure on the Adempiere Server Setup window, 
we might get a server setup error message—Error JDBC Connection. 
(Error connecting: jdbc:postgresql://your_pc_name:5432/template1 
– postgres/postgres). Just make sure that you have defined the 
Application Server, Database Server, Database Type, Database Name, 
and System Password, as mentioned earlier, and set up the PostgreSQL 
client authentication properly, as mentioned in the section 
Modifying client authentication configuration file.
As mentioned earlier, the ADempiere developer community will release their 
patches regularly. If there are newer patches available, you can download those 
patch files, perform MD5 verification, copy them to the C:\Adempiere\lib folder, 
and then run run_setup.bat again.

ADempiere Installation
[ 30 ]
Importing the initial ADempiere database
We need to import the structures such as tables, functions, initial data, and another 
prerequisite metadata into our blank ADempiere database previously created. 
ADempiere provides us with a script or batch file to load Adempiere_pg.dmp 
into our blank ADempiere database.
Find and execute RUN_ImportAdempiere.bat, which can be found in the 
C:\Adempiere\utils folder. During execution, this script will show you 
a message, as shown in the next screenshot:
Press Enter, and the import activity will run immediately.
If you encounter a:
psql: FATAL database "adempiere" does not exist
error message, then you can rectify this problem by accessing 
http://adempiere.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
adempiere/branches/adempiere343/utils/postgresql/
ImportAdempiere.bat.
From this preview file, we can copy the content and save it as 
ImportADempiere.bat.
Next, access the link http://adempiere.svn.sourceforge.
net/viewvc/adempiere/branches/adempiere343/utils/
postgresql/DBRestore.bat. 
Save it as DBRestore.bat.
Put these files in C:\Adempiere\utils\postgresql as a replacement 
for the initial files. This should fix your problem.
Although it lists the Adempiere.dmp file with our configuration value while executing 
run_setup.bat, this batch file should load and import the Adempiere_pg.dmp file.

[ 31 ]
Applying the database migration script
After importing the initial database structure, we need to apply all of the migration 
scripts available. The important thing, when applying the migration scripts, is that 
you have to process the files in a sequential order! You can check the number given 
in the file name of each of the available SQL files (based on sequential process). With 
our available migration script, the execution process would be in the following order:
1.	 372_round.sql
2.	 379_FR1883270_NextIdByYear.sql
3.	 391_C_Currency_Rate.sql
And so on.
To apply these SQL files, you need to open your DOS prompt. Change the active 
directory to C:\download\adempiere\sql. Then execute the following commands, 
one-by-one (and only execute each once):
psql -U adempiere -f 372_round.sql -o 372.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 379_FR1883270_NextIdByYear.sql -o 379.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 391_C_Currency_Rate.sql -o 391.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 398_currencyround.sql -o 398.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 413_BF2567104.sql -o 413.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 417_FR2582181.sql -o 417.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 436_MissingSysConfigKeys.sql -o 436.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 441_BF2710889_Add_Months.sql -o 441.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 442_BF2710889_PaymentTermDueDate.sql -o 442.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 443_BF2714803_InvoicepaidToDate.sql -o 443.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 444_BF2714831_InvoiceopenToDate.sql -o 444.txt
psql -U adempiere -f 566_FR1756793_RMA_JUST_FOR_343.sql -o 566.txt
You can supply the default password as adempiere (when system prompts with 
the Password for user adempiere message). After performing this activity, your 
database complies with the newer or latest ADempiere database structures.
For more information on migration scripts, you can access http://www.adempiere.

ADempiere Installation
[ 32 ]
ADempiere server memory management
We can check the physical memory available by opening Windows Task Manager. 
Use the shortcut keys Ctrl + Shift + Esc. Click on the Performance tab and you will 
see the Physical Memory (K) information, as shown in the following screenshot:
This shows that the author's computer has 2086956 kilobytes (almost 2 GB) of 
physical memory.
During the initial loading of the ADempiere application server, the system will 
allocate a minimum memory for its operations, and if necessary, it will allocate more 
memory resources until it reaches the maximum value specified by the configuration. 
We can access this configuration from the myEnvironment.bat file in the 
C:\Adempiere\utils folder.
If you go through this file, then you will find the following information:
@SET ADEMPIERE_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xms64M -Xmx512M -DADEMPIERE_HOME=C:\
Adempiere
With this default configuration, ADempiere will consume 64 MB of available 
memory (-Xms64M) during the initial loading. If required, the maximum memory 
could be allocated, that is, 512 MB (-Xmx512M).
We are not discussing how to perform efficient memory allocation. We are just 
ensuring that we have allocated the maximum memory, that is, 75 percent of 
our memory available.
With this requirement, we can set this configuration as follows:
@SET ADEMPIERE_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xms256M -Xmx512M -DADEMPIERE_HOME=C:\
Adempiere
This means that we will allocate a maximum of 512 MB of memory from the 
available memory of 1406 MB on the author's computer.
Starting up the ADempiere application server
On the server side, we need to start our application server. To start the application 
server, double-click on Run_Server2.bat in the C:\Adempiere\utils folder.

Chapter 1
[ 33 ]
Check the DOS Prompt, and wait for a while, until you see a notification such as 
the following:
12:31:52,564 INFO [Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [4.0.2 (build: 
CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_2 date=200505022023)] Started in 1m:48s:637ms
Now our application server is ready.
Starting the application server will start ADempiere's accounting processors, internal 
schedulers, ADempiere's web user interface, ADempiere's web admin tools (that can 
be used to install ADempiere client), ADempiere's client Web Start feature, and all of 
the activities related to the ADempiere server.
After we finish our work with the ADempiere server, we have to shut down the 
application server. We can shut it down by double-clicking on Run_Server2Stop.
bat in the C:\Adempiere\utils folder.
Installing ADempiere on the client side
With the application server started, we can access its 'service' from our client 
computer. Open your browser (Firefox Mozilla, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, 
or your own favorite browser), and type http://your_ipaddress/admin/ in the 
browser's address bar.
We will have a screen similar to the one shown in the next screenshot:

ADempiere Installation
[ 34 ]
ADempiere provides two types of ADempiere client installation: Web Start and 
Local Install. For easy administration, we recommend you to set up the ADempiere 
client installation using the Web Start feature.
Web Start client installation
This is the easiest way to install the ADempiere client on a client computer. Click on 
Click Here to WebStart Me Now!, and the installation process starts automatically.
While accessing Web Start for the first time, the system will download the 
application from the ADempiere server, perform verification of the application, 
and launch the ADempiere client application itself.
The system will check the latest client application configuration on the server side, 
before launching ADempiere client application the next time. If there are updates 
available, then the system will download the application again and launch the latest 
client application. With these features, all clients connected to the server will always 
use the updated ADempiere client application.
You can create a shortcut pointing to http://your_server_ip_
address/admin/adempiereHome/adempiereDirect.jnlp to 
access this ADempiere client Web Start feature.
Verifying the ADempiere client installation
Before using the ADempiere client application, we need to verify the ADempiere 
client connection through the ADempiere application server. Launch the Web Start 
application by double-clicking on the previously-created shortcut. The system will 
prompt us with the Adempiere – License Agreement window. Read it carefully, 
and accept the license.
This opens the Adempiere Connection window. Here, you need to change the 
following information:
No
Field
Default value
Set value to
1
Application Host
MyAppServer
your server ip address
Leave the other fields unchanged. For example, on the author's computer, the 
application host is 10.10.101.107.

Click on the Test Application Server button, followed by a click on Test Database. 
Ensure that both buttons result in a green check mark, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
If you click on the Ok button (green check mark) on the bottom right-hand side of 
the window, then you will be directed to the ADempiere login window. For now, 
click on the Cancel button, and we are done.

Summary
In this chapter, we have learned what is the minimum hardware specification 
for both the server and client computer, how to obtain the JDK, JRE, PostgreSQL 
databases, and the ADempiere application, and how to install JDK for the server 
and JRE for the client computer, set up the Java system variables and Windows path, 
and verify the settings with those of the computer. We also learned how to install 
the PostgreSQL database server, add and verify the PostgreSQL path, and configure 
the PostgreSQL client authentication properly, and how to configure the Windows 
Firewall to accept a database connection from the client computer.
We saw how to verify the ADempiere binary files, and how to set up the ADempiere 
server application and apply its patches. We were able to create a prerequisite login/
role and an ADempiere database and to import a predefined database structure. We 
learned about the ADempiere application server memory usage allocation, starting 
and stopping an ADempiere application server, installing an ADempiere client 
application and verifying an established connection to the server.
In the next chapter, you will be introduced to performing certain tasks with 
ADempiere and you will be playing with a predefined GardenWorld sample company.

Exploring the ADempiere 
Client and Performing Tasks
At the start of a training session, a student from the class asks the following question:
I have just installed ADempiere on my computer and launched the ADempiere Web 
Start client to log in to the application. However, I do not understand what to do 
with the application's screens. Even though I am already familiar with Microsoft 
Windows, the structure of these screens is quite new for me. Could you please 
explain these screens to me?
This is not a naïve question. Like all new users who do not have experience in 
operating ERP software applications, this student needs to know the purpose of 
the screen along with information on the buttons, tabs, and so on inside each screen. 
Once the users know the main function of a certain screen, they will use and operate 
the software more effectively.
In this chapter, we will learn:
How to establish a connection to a specific ADempiere server
The standard format of an ADempiere screen
Application preferences
How to perform tasks
We will start our discussion by introducing you to the connection aspect 
of ADempiere.

[ 38 ]
The Connection aspect of ADempiere
Our pre-installed ADempiere application will contain a sample company data called 
GardenWorld company. To make ourselves familiar with ADempiere, we will 
access this company data, using a predefined user ID and password. Launch your 
ADempiere application server, and then launch the ADempiere Web Start client.
Checking the ADempiere client version
With ADempiere patches being frequently available, we need to know the version 
of ADempiere client that we are working on.
In the ADempiere Web Start client/fat client (not web-based version), through the 
ADempiere Login window, you can find the information that indicates the version 
of ADempiere in use. In this window, you can find the ADempiere client version by 
examining the information in the format 3.4.2s+P20091109. With this information, the 
system tells you that you are using:
The ADempiere 3.4.2s (stable) version
The latest patches installed on the system released on November, 09 2009
The predefined user ID and password
Coming to the ADempiere Login window, the system supplies us with a 
GardenAdmin User ID and an obscured Password. The question is: 
What exactly is the GardenAdmin password?
•
•

Chapter 2
[ 39 ]
Within your current connection window, the system will serve us with the 
GardenAdmin user ID. However, this is not the only user ID that is available. 
Our ADempiere installation has a common list of user IDs and passwords, as 
mentioned in the following table:
No
User ID
Password
1
System
System
2
SuperUser
System
3
GardenAdmin
GardenAdmin
4
GardenUser
GardenUser
We can try all of these user IDs in the Adempiere Login window. When typing 
these user IDs and passwords, check the Caps Lock status. The system will check the 
capitalization of the characters being typed. When supplied with a wrong password, 
you will get a User does not match password error message.
After typing your GardenAdmin password, you will be directed to the Defaults 
tab of the Adempiere Login window. Here, you have an option to set the Role, 
Client, Organization, Warehouse, Date, and Printer values. Leave the information 
as it is, and click on the Ok button. You are now playing with a preconfigured 
GardenWorld sample client. 

Exploring the ADempiere Client and Performing Tasks
[ 40 ]
Understanding the Client and System users
With the default ADempiere installation, we can group users into the 
following types:
Client users
System users
The type of user is determined by the kind of Role being used when connecting 
to the ADempiere system. A Client user is a type of user who has the rights to 
access Client information (for example, GardenWorld Client), whereas a System user 
is a type of user who has the rights to perform system-related tasks, such as accessing 
and configuring the Application Dictionary through the System Client.
With the Application Dictionary, you can perform low-level 
configuration, such as:
Configure the Table and Column definitions to save your data
Construct a Window, Tab, and fields to build your ADempiere 
window
Set up a Report and Process to generate your reports
Most of these parts can be done without altering the ADempiere source 
code. Any information in the Application Dictionary is user-extensible 
and can include user-specific configuration
•
•
•
The GardenAdmin user ID is an example of a Client user. This user ID should 
be able to connect to the ADempiere server with the GardenWorld Admin or the 
GardenWorld User role. The System and SuperUser user IDs are examples of 
System users. When logging in to the ADempiere system, these IDs can connect 
with the System Administrator role.
SuperUser can be used to access both System and Client information.
Changing our ADempiere server connection
During our testing phase, it's quite common to have multiple ADempiere servers. 
At least, we will have both a demo and a production ADempiere application 
server environment.
•
•

Chapter 2
[ 41 ]
You can choose your target ADempiere server by clicking on the Server field on the 
Adempiere Login window, as shown in the following screenshot:
As mentioned in Chapter 1, ADempiere Installation, you will see an ADempiere 
Connection window. Complete the Application Host field with the target IP address 
(or computer name) of the ADempiere server, and leave the other fields with their 
default values. Ensure the connection between the client and the server computer 
by clicking on the Test Application Server button. If this button displays a green 
check mark, then the system will automatically put the information in the database 
connection information into this window. You can verify the database connection 
by clicking on the Test Database button.
When both of these buttons display a green check mark, this means that we have 
successfully connected to both, the ADempiere server and the database server. 
Finalize this task by clicking on the OK button.
Which ADempiere server are we working on?
After logging onto the ADempiere web start client, information such as 
GardenAdmin@GardenWorld.HQ [sistematika-v{sistematika-v-adempiere-
adempiere}] is displayed at the top of our main program. Could you explain 
what it means?
Sometimes, after changing your ADempiere server connection, you need to 
check which ADempiere server you are working on. To do so, after logging into 
ADempiere, you can check the value displayed at the top of the main form, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
The format for the connection information is as follows:
user@client.warehouse [adempiere_server_computer_id {database_server_
computer_id-database_name-database_user-id}]

Managing ADempiere client
After successfully logging on to your ADempiere client using the GardenAdmin 
user ID, you will first be directed to the Performance tab. This tab contains a list 
of performance goal charts and bar charts. These charts are just an example of the 
default predefined charts. Navigate to the Menu tab to access the list of menus 
available, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
[ 43 ]
In general, there are four main tabs available on the screen: Performance, Menu, 
Workflow Activities, and Workflow.
The Performance tab is used for measuring the performance of the 
company. This type of information is configurable and could be attached 
to a certain Role, in case we need to limit the user rights while accessing 
this information.
The Menu tab allows you to access all of the menus within ADempiere. It 
can be used to access Windows, Forms, Reports, Processes, and General 
Workflows. Examples of menus are Purchase Order, Sales Order, Product, 
and so on. The availability of these menus is configurable and depends 
upon the access rights given to the Role.
The Workflow Activities tab is used to display the active running document 
workflow that needs your confirmation.
The last tab is the Workflow tab. This is used for General Workflow purpose. 
For example, while registering a product there is a step-by-step action to 
perform the product setup. First, we will define the Warehouse & Locators, 
followed by Unit of Measure, Product Category, Tax Category, and finally 
the Product. We shall discuss the workflow topics in more detail, later.
Working with the Menu
Pressing Alt + M will direct you to the Menu tab. There are two main sections to 
this screen. The first (left-hand side) section is the Navigation Bar, which contains 
shortcuts to access the Business Partner, Sales Order, and Product (for now). The 
second (right-hand side) section contains the ADempiere menus that are available for 
the user's Role. Select the Expand Tree option and you will get a list of the granted 
ADempiere menus.
Sometimes, there will be an underlined character in the menu name 
(for example, Menu, File, and so on). With this underlined character, 
you can access the menu by pressing Alt + the underlined character.

Menu Icon
While we are taking a look at the menus available, there are currently four different 
icons present. The meaning of each icon is as follows:
    Icon
Description
Normal ADempiere Window or Form: This window is used for managing 
records, entering records, or viewing our transactions (for example, Purchase 
Order, Sales Order, and Accounting Fact Balances). Moreover, this icon is used 
to perform an activity that utilizes the ADempiere form (for example, Matching 
PO-Receipt-Invoice, Import File Loader, and so on).
Process: This performs tasks or jobs that could be done in the database 
(for example, Generate Shipments and Update Accounting Balance).
Reports: Generates reports, which can be modified, exported, and printed 
easily (for example, Trial Balance and Statement of Accounts).
General Workflow: Continuous step-by-step activities to achieve a goal 
(for example, Accounting Setup and Tax Setup).
Accessing menus
Throughout this book, you will be guided through the process of opening some 
menu or executing some processes. For example, "open the Menu | System Admin 
| Client Rules | Client window". With this guidance, in the ADempiere main menu, 
you can open the Client window by:
1.	 Clicking on Menu.
2.	 Clicking on System Admin.
3.	 Clicking on Client Rules.
4.	 Finally, clicking on the Client window.
as shown in the following screenshot:
You can follow this approach later, when opening another window.

Menu Lookup and creating shortcuts
Well, as I start exploring ADempiere and select the Expand Tree option, it gives me 
tons of menus. While I try to access, let's say, the Request window, I have to scroll 
down the menu screen to accomplish this task. It is absolutely unmanageable! Is 
there a way to speed up the search process?
First method: In the Menu tab, you can access the Lookup feature. You 
can find this feature in the bottom right-hand side of the Menu tab. Press 
Alt + L, type any text contained in the menu you want to locate, and press 
Enter. You will be directed to the first menu that contains the requested word. 
Press Enter again, and you will be directed to the next menu containing the 
requested word. You can press Enter as many times required, until you reach 
your target menu. After reaching your target menu, press Ctrl + Enter to open 
or execute the menu.
Second method: There are many windows that are used by our users while 
operating ADempiere everyday. Our accounting person will frequently 
access the GL Journal window, Trial Balance report, and other menus 
related to accounting. Fortunately, we can add our favorite windows, reports, 
and process menus to the Navigation Bar. Just find your menu (which you 
can do with our first method), then right-click on the menu, and it will show 
the Add to Bar popup menu, as seen in the following screenshot:
Click on Add to Bar, and your favorite menu will be added to the Navigation 
Bar. Next time, we may just go to the Navigation Bar and click on the 
appropriate menu to speed up our operation.
A menu added onto the Navigation Bar is saved into the 
user's Role. All of the users connected to this Role can 
access the predefined menu listed in the Navigation Bar.

User preferences
Occasionally, we may check our preference while working with the ADempiere 
client. We could access this window by selecting Tools | Preference on our main 
window or on each ADempiere window. Here, we will have five tabs of information, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
The explanation of each of the tabs is as follows:
Preference: This contains a list of options that can be used to define 
the default ADempiere client behavior for the ADempiere user. This 
configuration is saved on the local computer and will work only on this 
computer. For example, when we select the Automatic Login and Store 
Password options, every time that the user runs the ADempiere client on 
the computer, the system will use the latest user ID and password. It will 
bypass the login window and go directly to the main ADempiere client 
window. Although this is useful when working with the ADempiere demo 
environment, it could be dangerous when working on a production or live 
ADempiere environment.
A list of recommended values for the most important fields is as follows:

If deselected, we can get more than one 
instance of a window. For example, when 
opening the Product window, click on the 
Product menu again. Now, there will be two 
instances of the Product window. To avoid 
any confusion when working with multiple 
Product windows, it is suggested to have a 
single instance of the window.

User Interface Theme: Change to the theme which best suits your needs.
Info: Contains information about the ADempiere system itself. The most 
important information contained is: In which Role are we connected, and 
where is the Adempiere.properties file saved.
Context: This is a list of internal ADempiere variables. These variables will be 
used intensively when applying the configuration in Application Dictionary.
Errors: This contains information about the error from the application 
(if any).
The Info, Context, and Errors tabs are mostly used by Technical Support 
if you encounter a problem with your ADempiere environment.
More on the Cache Window option
ADempiere will build all of the ADempiere windows based on the configuration in 
the Application Dictionary. If you do not select the Cache Window option in Tools 
| Preference, then upon opening a window, ADempiere will read the configuration 
again and re-create the window. This will take time!
Although it is suitable for testing purposes, ensure that you select the Cache 
Window option in the ADempiere Production or Live environment.
Parts of the ADempiere window
Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Purchase Order window. All 
ADempiere windows will consist of six standard parts, as highlighted in the 
following screenshot:

C
Area for entering or viewing information.
D
List of tabs of information. This will mostly be used for splitting master detail 
information. For the Purchase Order window, the first tab consists of Purchase 
Order header information, and the second tab consists of the PO Line. This 
contains items or products that we need to buy.
E
A status bar showing system information such as Record saved, Navigate or 
Update record, Total value, and so on.
F
Record information (Record Info) showing the database table name and internal 
record identity for information in the active tab. This can be used to track any 
changes, if necessary.
More on Record Info
To get a better understanding of Record Info, open the Menu | Requisition-to-
Invoice | Purchase Order window. In the active Purchase Order tab you must 
double-click on part F of a window. The information we will get is similar to the 
following screenshot:
In the previous screenshot, we can see the following information:
All information related to the Purchase Order header will be saved in the 
database to the table with the name C_Order.
The Primary Key (internal unique record identity) for the C_Order table is 
C_Order_ID, and has the value 1000003.
If the auditing feature is enabled, you will have information about field value 
changes. In this screen, the column or field C_Order_ID has been updated 
with the value 1000003, by GardenAdmin, at the time specified in the 
Updated column.

When we have information such as 0/0 in the F window area, it 
means that there are no records available for this window. When 
it shows 2/5, This means you are accessing the second record of 
a total of five available records. Please note that the system will 
show Record Info only if there are records available in a window.
OK or Cancel button in the window
Throughout this book, there will be tasks that require you to click on either the 
Cancel or OK button in a certain window. Take a look at the following screenshot:
The Cancel button is the button indicated by a red cross, whereas the OK button is 
the button indicated by a green tick.
Maintaining a log of data changes
The system will show the history of our data changes only if we have already 
activated the Maintain Change Log feature. There are two ways of activating 
this feature:
Role-based: This feature can be set up in the Role, which is associated 
with the user, upon login to the ADempiere client. To activate this auditing 
feature, navigate to the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Security 
| Role window. Set the active tab to Role, and select your targeted role. 
Find and select the Maintain Change Log checkbox, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
•

Chapter 2
[ 51 ]
Table based: You can activate this feature based on the Table. The Table is a 
place where you save information in your databases. Activate this feature by 
logging in with the System user ID and System Administrator as the role. 
Open the Menu | Application Dictionary | Table and Column window. 
Find your table, and select the Maintain Change Log checkbox.
Standard window fields
When you enter or view information in part C of the ADempiere window, there will 
be a couple of standard fields available.
Client and Organization fields
ADempiere has a feature to set up both multi-client and multi-organizational 
transactions. You can set up as many clients and organizations as you need. 
We will discuss how to set up clients and organizations later.
To segregate information, the Client and Organization fields are used to save 
both the client (or company) and the organization (or division) information in each 
ADempiere information or data.
The following screenshot shows us an example of the client and organization fields 
in the Business Partner window:
Active checkbox fields
Within certain windows, there is another standard field available. This is known 
as the Active checkbox. Generally, this checkbox should be available in a window 
that is used to enter some data that is being repeatedly used within applications as 
references (something similar to master data).
Some examples of windows that contain Active checkboxes are Warehouse, 
Business Partner, Price List, and so on. Although this master data will not to be used 
in your further transactions, you are advised to not remove or delete this information 
for data integrity purposes. Instead, mark these information records as inactive by 
deselecting the Active checkbox.

Setting additional search criteria
Is it possible to add an additional column or field to the standard Lookup 
Record search?
With this procedure, we can add the Order Reference of a Purchase Order as a 
standard Lookup Record.
Log in as the user System and with the password System. Set the role to System 
Administrator, client to System, organization to *, and keep the warehouse 
value blank.
Next time, if we need to "log in to System", then we will follow 
this procedure.
You will be directed to the Navigation Bar, which contains parts of the Application 
Dictionary, as shown in the following screenshot:

using the existing GardenWorld sample company data, she can perform the 
following tasks:
1.	 Log in with the GardenAdmin user ID, set the role to GardenWorld Admin, 
client to GardenWorld, organization to HQ, and warehouse 
to HQ Warehouse.

2.	 Open the Menu | Partner Relations | Business Partner Rules | Business 
Partner window. Navigate to the Patio Fun, Inc. records. Here, she can click 
on the Zoom Across button, which will result in the context menu shown in 
the following screenshot:
Well, we have one purchase order for this business partner.
3.	 Then, she can click on Purchase Order (#1). The ADempiere system will 
prompt her with the Purchase Order window. She can then check and note 
down the document number (800002) and PO Line information. Now, if 
she wants to know the status of the material receipt of this purchase order, 
she can click on the Zoom Across button in this Purchase Order window. 
She will then notice that there is a Material Receipt (#1), as shown in the 
following screenshot:
4.	 We have one document for this business partner. Rossy can click on Material 
Receipt (#1), and the Material Receipt window will open. She can examine 
this document, check the Receipt Line information, and find out whether we 
have received our order.
Based on these tasks, Rossy should be able to answer the Manager's question.
Field context menu
When working with the ADempiere window, there will be a menu, which will help 
us while we are working in each field. There will be three options: Zoom, ReQuery, 
and Value Preference. For our example, after opening the Purchase Order window, 
point your mouse at the Warehouse field, and right-click in the field. The system will 
show a menu similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
[ 59 ]
Zoom
Data that is repeatedly used in an ADempiere window (such as, Customer, Vendor, 
Currency information, and so on) will be registered as master data. Some examples 
of master data that can be set up are: Warehouse, Business Partner, Product, Bank, 
Cash book, and so on. With this best practice, we just set the information once and 
you can re-use the existing data as references.
This menu will be active or available only if the field has a link to the master or 
reference data. The purpose of this feature is to show you the detailed information 
of the selected information in the field.
In the previous screenshot, Warehouse is an example of the field where you 
can browse for detailed information on HQ Warehouse. Click on Zoom in this 
information. The system will open the Warehouse window, which contains the 
detailed information of the HQ Warehouse.
Although this feature works for the Warehouse field, it is also applicable to all 
fields that have links to the master data. Try it out yourself to see how it works 
for the Business Partner, Organization, and Price List fields in the Purchase 
Order window.
ReQuery
Similar to Zoom, this menu will be active or available only if the fields have a link to 
master data. The purpose of this menu is to get the latest information from databases 
for the field on which we open the context menu.
Previously, the Warehouse option listed only the HQ Warehouse. In case, at the 
same time, there was additional HQ warehouse information being entered by 
another user, this new information is not available as an option. To get the 
latest warehouse information, just click on the ReQuery menu.

Exploring the ADempiere Client and Performing Tasks
[ 60 ]
Value preference
This menu is available for all kinds of fields. The purpose of this menu is to set up a 
default value when working with an ADempiere document. We can set a value and 
make it a default value that can be configured to all or a specific organization, all or a 
specific user and/or all or a specific window.
For example, open a Purchase Order window and point your mouse to the Price List 
field, and then pick Purchase from the list. We can make Purchase values a default 
value by right-clicking and selecting the Value Preference menu, and then selecting 
the Organization checkbox, User/Contact checkbox, and Window checkbox, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
With this set up, the next time this specific user opens the Purchase Order window 
and uses the HQ as its organization, the default value for the Price List field would 
be Purchase.
If you deselect the Organization and User/Contact checkbox as your value 
preference, then when all of the users connected to the ADempiere client, using any 
Organization, open this Purchase Order window, the default value for the Price List 
field will be Purchase.

Chapter 2
[ 61 ]
Summary
In this chapter, you have learnt the basics of the ADempiere Web Start client, and 
have learnt how to perform common tasks.
Working with the default ADempiere installation, you were provided with a 
predefined user ID and password. There were two types of users that could be 
used (Client and System). During your testing phase, you might have more than 
one ADempiere server running. You can access your specific ADempiere server by 
changing your server connection.
Next, you saw the basics of the ADempiere client. There is a list of menus available, 
and you have learnt the meaning of each menu icon. You can easily search your 
menu using the Menu Lookup feature. You learnt that you could create a shortcut for 
the menus that you use and how to access this menu. We saw the standard layout of 
the ADempiere window, and explained the six parts that the window is comprised 
of. In each ADempiere window, we saw the standard fields such as the Client, 
Organization, and Active checkboxes.
We looked at how to perform some common tasks. These tasks included data 
management, data navigation, printing, and the lookup of records. Finally, 
we introduced the field context menu feature, including Zoom, ReQuery, and 
Value Preference.
Continuing our discussion, you will explore company and client structures and the 
initial client setup in our next chapter. You will also learn how to create a apparel 
company sample structure.


Exploring Company Structures 
and the Initial Client Setup
While preparing for an ADempiere implementation, we have to know exactly how to 
map our company structures into ADempiere. Consider the next example from the 
fashion industry. An apparel company will have at least one or more Facility (plant) 
at which to manufacture clothes. It will also have one or more Warehouses in which 
to put the Raw Materials and Finished Goods.
There is no strict guidance on how to map your company structure into ADempiere. 
It is an art. In ADempiere, company structures will involve configuration of at least 
the Client, Organization, and Warehouse.
Based on our final company structure configuration, our upcoming document 
transaction will generate General Ledger (GL) journal entries in ADempiere 
accounting parts, which will also contain Client, Organization, and if applicable, 
Warehouse information.
By using these GL journal entries, you can create financial reports. GL journal entries 
aid in better analysis to achieve the company goals.
In this chapter, we will learn about and explain:

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 64 ]
Sample apparel company structure
Sistematika Fashion Ltd is an apparel company that manufactures a variety of 
clothes. It produces mainly dresses, shirts, and jackets. The complexity to produce 
such types of clothes is different. It requires a different set of skills to manage and 
make these products. Hence, it has a different plant for each of these types of product.
Currently, Sistematika has three plants and each plant has one or two warehouses. 
In each warehouse, there is at least one location in which to put the raw materials 
and/or finished goods.
Based on the physical location approach, the following is a complete representation of 
the company's structure:
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd
Dress Facility
Jacket Facility
1st Dress
Warehouse
1st Shirt
Warehouse
1st Jacket
Warehouse
2nd Dress
Warehouse
Loc D1A
Loc D2A
Loc D2B
Loc S1A
Loc J1A
Loc J1B
Loc D1B
Shirt Facility
This figure tells us that the company has three facilities—Dress Facility, Shirt 
Facility, and Jacket Facility. The Dress Facility has two warehouses—1st Dress 
Warehouse and 2nd Dress Warehouse. The first warehouse internally contains two 
locations to put your stuff—Loc D1A, which means Dress facility, first warehouse and 
location A, and Loc D1B means Dress facility, first warehouse and location B.
With the above explanation, it is easy to read the figure.

ADempiere company structures
How do we map company structures into ADempiere?
ADempiere generally sets up a company hierarchy and we can map it with 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd., as shown in the following screenshot:
Company structure in Adempiere
Client
Organization A
Warehouse 1
Mapping with Sistematika Fashion,
Ltd company structure
Company
Facility/Plant/Division/Business Unit
Warehouse
Internal location inside warehouse
Locator 1
Locator 2
In short, it means that one or more Locators will be connected to only one 
Warehouse, one or more Warehouses will be connected to only one Organization, 
and one or more organization will be connected to only one Client.
Refer to the table below for a detailed description of terms:
Terms
Description
Client
The highest entity in ADempiere that can be set up as our company's 
legal entity. All of the data that is set up in this level can be read by 
all organizations belonging to this company. ADempiere allows us to 
have one or more clients in the system. If we enter any information for 
a specific client (and not System client), no other client will be granted 
access to, or be allowed to share that data. When we enter information 
through the System client, all other clients will be granted access to this 
information. We can map Sistematika Fashion Ltd. here.
Organization
An entity that can be set up as a subunit entity, company division, or 
business/production unit. We can set this organization up as a sub-
unit of product division (in our case, it could be Dress, Shirt, or Jacket), 
accounting division, and so on. One or more organizations can be linked 
to a specific or parent organization, which normally has a division 
organization type.
Warehouse
A place where we can put, get, or save the raw materials or finished 
goods. A warehouse will contain one or more physical locations. An 
organization can contain one or more warehouses.

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 66 ]
Now, we can further segregate our preliminary Sistematika Fashion Ltd. company 
structures, as shown in the next figure:

Even though mapping a company structure is an art, throughout this book, we will 
map structures as shown in the previous figure, which means that A will be the 
area for the Client, B for Organizations, C for Warehouses, and D for the internal 
locations within a warehouse.
Managing the Chart of accounts template
While creating a client in ADempiere, we will require an initial chart of accounts 
to make the ADempiere accounting engine run properly. As you are no doubt 
aware of what a chart of accounts means by now, we will not get into the details 
of it. If you still need to know what chart of accounts exactly is, refer to 
http://www.accountingcoach.com/online-accounting-course/15Xpg01.html.
ADempiere has a feature to import an initial chart of accounts. This needs to be 
written in a specific format. For clarity, we can learn a lot about chart of accounts 
format from a predefined example of chart of accounts. In a standard installation, 
there will be a default list of charts of accounts examples that can be used for your 
reference. You can access this file from the C:\ADempiere\data\import folder. This 
folder contains several examples of charts of accounts in Excel format (xls) files and 
Comma Separated Values (csv) files.
It will be feasible to use the more familiar xls format file, and after you are ready 
with your chart of accounts format, you can save this file in csv format. ADempiere 
will use the csv file format for importing purposes.

Chapter 3
[ 67 ]
Exploring the accounting format template files
One example of files for our study is AccountingUS.xls. Although this file comes 
in a default Microsoft Excel format, you can use the OpenOffice Calc to work on this 
file. Open this file with any of your favorite spreadsheet applications. The following 
screenshot shows an example of the standard contents of the AccountingUS.xls file:
As we can see in the above screenshot, this file contains several columns, and there 
are simple descriptions about what each column is intended for. The following table 
provides the descriptions of the values from columns A to I on this sheet:
Column
Value
Description
A
Account_Value
This column contains a list of account numbers in the 
General Ledger. The account format uses a numerical 
format, and the column cannot contain a duplicate 
number. This field is mandatory.
B
Account_Name
This contains short meaningful names of the accounts. 
These names will appear on financial reports. This field 
is mandatory.
C
Account_Description This provides a clear description of the account name.
D
Account_Type
In standard accounting principles, there are standard 
accounting types. ADempiere uses six standard account 
types, namely, Asset, Liability, Owner's Equity, Revenue, 
Expense, and Memo. This field is mandatory.
E
Account_Sign
This indicates if the expected balance of an account should 
be Debit or Credit. If set to Natural, then the account sign 
will follow the default behavior of that account's type. For 
example, Asset and Expense will use the Debit account 
sign. If you do not supply any value in this field, it will use 
Natural as the default account sign value.

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 68 ]
Column
Value
Description
F
Account_Document
Indicates whether this account is document controlled. 
Examples of document are MM Receipt and AR Receipt. If 
Yes, then you cannot use this account manually within the 
GL Journal transaction. If you try to complete a GL Journal 
transaction using this document controlled account, then 
you will get this message Account used is document 
controlled - Do not use for manual journals.
G
Account_Summary
A summary account is an account whose balance 
represents the total balance of other account balances. If 
we set an account up as an account summary, we cannot 
create a transaction using this account.
H
Default_Account
While posting ADempiere documents (for example, 
MM Receipt), the system should use the default account 
to determine where to post both the Asset and Not 
Invoiced Receipt account. Examples of default accounts 
involved in this document are B_ASSET_ACCT and 
NOTINVOICEDRECEIPTS_ACCT. Defining B_ASSET_
ACCT in this column means that the account value in 
this line is to be used for this purpose. There are 71 types 
of default accounts, which need to be bound to Account 
Value.
I
Account_Parent
This defines the parent of an account value. Mostly, the 
account parent is Summary Account (Account_Summary).
This file is only a sample format of how to arrange and construct the ADempiere 
chart of accounts. Once you are familiar with this format, you can define your own 
chart of accounts. Throughout this book, we will use the chart of accounts taken 
from the C:\Adempiere\data\import\AccountingUS.xls file.
Account editor tools
Altering and inserting new accounts in the AccountingUS.xls file is an exhausting 
task and error prone. Is there any better way to make sure that our initial chart of 
accounts format files was configured properly?
ADempiere has been powered by its community. The community listens to user 
expectations in order to minimize or reduce problems when working with the 
initial chart of accounts. To make our life easier when managing the pre-import 
chart of accounts, there are tools available for free to fulfill our needs. For example, 
the Account Editor 1.2 tool written by Daniel Tamm.

Chapter 3
[ 69 ]
Download the tool from http://downloads.sourceforge.net/adempiere/
adempiereAcctEdit_v1.2.zip and put the file into the C:\download\tools 
folder. This ZIP file contains two files: adempiereAcctEdit.bat and 
adempiereAcctEdit.jar.
Extract the contents of this file to the C:\Adempiere folder. This tool will read and 
save your work in the Comma Separated Values (csv) file format. Double-click 
on the adempiereAcctEdit.bat file, and then on the main menu, click on 
File | Open Schema File. When prompted, pick the AccountingUS.csv file 
from the C:\Adempiere\data\import folder. Check out the following 
screenshot for reference:
This screen has two sides. The left-hand side is for account tree visualization, and the 
right-hand side contains Details, List of accounts, and Default accounts tabs.
The Details tab contains detailed information about the selected account, as 
previously described in the table listing the A to I column information.
List of accounts is a complete list of our accounts.
Default Accounts contains all 71 default accounts that need to be linked to 
your account value definition.
Along with entering or altering the data in the Details section, you also need to select 
Document controlled or Summary account, or choose an option: Account type, 
Account sign, or Default account, to avoid any error.

[ 70 ]
This is shown in the following screenshot:
You will notice that B_ASSET_ACCT default account is still not associated or 
linked with an account value yet. We know this from the blank value in the 
Account id field.
To link this default account to account 11100, just scroll to the left-hand side of this 
tool, find the 11100 account, and click on it. After pointing to this account, click on 
the Details tab, set the mouse pointer to the Default Account field information, 
choose the B_ASSET_ACCT: Checking Account from the drop-down list, and 
click on the Save button. That is all.
Ensure that all of the ADempiere default accounts are linked to one and only one 
account value. Although there are no validation procedures to check the validity 
of your work, this tool will save you a lot of time.
Finally, when you are comfortable with the new chart of accounts configuration, 
the AccountingUS.csv file is ready to be imported into ADempiere.
Creating a new ADempiere client
Let's start by creating a fictitious client. Log in to the system by using the user ID 
System and using System Administrator as the role, and then open the Menu | 
System Admin | Client Rules | Initial Client Setup window. You will see the 
screen shown in the following screenshot:
www.allitebooks.com

Chapter 3
[ 71 ]
As you can see from the above screenshot, you have to enter the information shown 
in the following table:
Field
Description
Client
Enter your company name. As per our sample apparel company structure, 
enter Sistematika Fashion, Ltd here.
Organization
We have three organizations. In this part, we will enter the first 
organization, Dress. We will enter other organizations later, after we have 
successfully created this client.
User/Contact 
Client
Here you can enter your user ID that has administrator rights. For 
simplicity, we put the default user ID admin here. Although we are not 
provided with a password for this user, ADempiere will provide a default 
password for this user, which is the same as the user ID name. You should 
change this default password immediately. It will also create template 
administrator roles based on these values.
User/Contact 
Organization
Set a regular user ID that holds restricted rights. Enter the user ID name 
user here. ADempiere will provide a default password for this user ID. The 
password is the same as the username.
Currency
This is the default currency for this company. This currency will be used 
as the standard currency in the ADempiere accounting schema. Set the 
currency you wish. In this book, we will choose US Dollar as our company 
currency.

Optional
This is used to define information about the accounting schema element 
as a part of our accounting dimension. For now, select Business Partner, 
Product, Project, Campaign, and Sales Region.
Click on the Load Accounting Values Format: Accounting__.csv button. Select 
AccountingUS.csv from the C:\Adempiere\data\import folder, and click on OK 
to proceed with our initial client creation. Wait for a moment, and ensure that you 
get a successful client creation window, as shown in the following screenshot:
If you are facing an error message such as Error while creating the Accounting 
Setup, you will have to re-check your AccountingUS.csv chart of accounts files. 
Make the appropriate changes, and then perform the initial client creation again.
For our test, it is recommended to not alter the original 
AccountingUS.csv file. While using the original file, the initial 
client creation procedure can be done without any problems.

Chapter 3
[ 73 ]
Reviewing your new ADempiere 
client creation
With the successful creation of the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd. client, we can access this 
client as soon as possible.
For our reference, when asked to log in with user ID admin, it 
means that you need to log in with your admin user ID, with the 
default password admin, click on the Ok button, set the role to 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin, client Sistematika Fashion, Ltd, 
and organization to *, and click on Ok once again.
Log in with user ID admin—The new client will show only three active tabs—Menu, 
Workflow Activities, and Workflow. The difference between GardenWorld and 
this one is that this client does not have a Performance tab. The newly-created 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd. client by itself does not have any shortcut menu.
Open another ADempiere client instance, log in to GardenWorld, and perform a 
side-by-side comparison of the main tab and menu appearance.
For verification purposes, you can find the procedure in the Menu | System Admin 
| Client Rules | Initial Client Setup Review general workflow.
We can perform a client review by accessing the following list in the window:
Client
Organization
Role
User
Import File Loader
Import Account
Calendar Year and Period
This is a standard workflow that comes with a default ADempiere installation. This 
is an example of what is referred to as a general workflow. Click on Client in this 
workflow, and you will be directed to the client window. We do not need to alter 
any information in this window.

Setting additional organizations
We have one organization (Dress), one warehouse (Standard), and one locator 
(Standard) in the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd client at the moment. We need to add 
more organizations, warehouses, and locators to comply with our initial company 
structures. To proceed with this activity, you need to log in with user ID admin 
(remember to set Organization to *).
Creating the organization type
We will set up a Division and Sub Unit organization type. Open the 
Menu | System Admin | Organization Rules | Organization Type window. 
Click on the New button, and complete the fields with the following information:
Field

Leave the other fields unchanged. Click on the Save button, perform the same tasks 
for the 2nd record, and finally we will have two records of organization type.
Creating an additional organization
We are now at the stage where we can enter a new organization. Open the Menu 
| System Admin | Organization Rules | Organization window. This window 
contains three tabs—Organization, Organization Info, and Org Assignment.
Click on the Organization tab and then click on the New button. Set the value to 
Shirt in both the Search Key and Name fields. Ensure that the Active checkbox is 
selected, and then click on the Save button. When the system displays the Do you 
want to save changes? confirmation window, just click on the OK button.
Click on New once again, set the value to Jacket in both Search Key and Name 
fields, and click on the Save button to complete your additional organization.

Chapter 3
[ 75 ]
Updating organization information
In this subsection, we will update the existing organization info (Dress, Shirt, and 
Jacket), set the organization type to Sub Unit, and set your address to organization 
name Facility Address.
Ensure that you are on the Organization tab, and set the active records in Dress 
organization by clicking on Dress record, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the Organization Info tab and set Organization Type field to Sub Unit. 
Click on the Address field, complete the field with Dress Facility Address, click 
on the OK button to confirm your address information, and then click on the Save 
button. When the system shows the Do you want to save changes? confirmation 
window, just click on the OK button.
Set the Organization Type field to Sub Unit in both Shirt and Jacket. Set the address 
to Shirt Facility Address for the Shirt organization and Jacket Facility Address for 
the Jacket organization.
In the Do you want to save changes? confirmation window, you will 
also be prompted to re-login and restart your application server for most 
changes made here to be effective. This is a normal confirmation 
and you can follow this suggestion after completing or altering all of 
your organization records.

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 76 ]
Setting up an additional warehouse
During client creation, the system provides us with one warehouse, named 
Standard, that contains one locator also named Standard.
Locator is a place or a location to put our stuff such 
as raw materials and finished goods.
In your company structure illustration, there will be a total of four warehouses and 
seven locators.
Altering the existing default warehouse 
and locators
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | 
Warehouse & Locators window. This window contains five tabs—Warehouse, 
Locator, Storage, Replenish, and Accounting. We will only be working with the 
Warehouse and Locator tabs at the moment. When you open this window, you will 
be redirected to the Warehouse tab with the Standard warehouse records. Perform 
the following steps:
1.	 Change the values of Search Key and Name fields from Standard to 
1st Dress W/h.
2.	 Click on the small button inside your Address field.
3.	 Set your address to 1st Dress W/h Address.
4.	 Click on the OK button, and then click on the Save button.
Update Standard locator records, which are already linked with 1st Dress W/h
as follows:
1.	 Click on your Locator tab.
2.	 In the existing Standard locator record, change the value of the Search Key 
field from Standard to Loc D1A.
3.	 Click on the Save button.

Chapter 3
[ 77 ]
One remaining activity is to add the locator Loc D1B to this warehouse. This is done 
as follows:
1.	 Click on the New button in the Locator tab.
The default value for Organization field is Dress and 1st Dress W/h 
for the Warehouse field. These values are automatically inserted and 
cannot be changed.
2.	 Set the Search Key field to Loc D1B, enter 1 in the Aisle field, and 0 in the 
Bin and Level fields.
3.	 Finalize your settings by clicking on the Save button.
Aisle, Bin, and Level are more specific or detailed places inside a 
warehouse. We cannot set the same combination of value for aisle, 
bin, and level inside one warehouse. The system will automatically 
reject duplicate combination values of aisle, bin, and level inside 
a warehouse.
Thus, we now have a complete location for the 1st Dress warehouse. Using this data, 
we can visualize our company structure, as shown in the next figure:
Locators area

Adding extra warehouses and locators
Adding an extra warehouse and locators is an easy task.
First, we need to define the additional warehouses. In the Warehouse & Locators 
window, ensure that we are on the Warehouse tab. The following information 
needs to be entered in the Warehouse tab fields:
Field

Click on New, enter information for the 2nd record, and then click on the Save 
button. Perform the same steps for the 3rd and 4th records.
After adding additional warehouses, we need to supply their locators. We will add 
a locator for the 2nd Dress warehouse. On the Warehouse tab, when you are not in 
grid mode, click on the Grid Toggle button. Ensure that your active record is in 2nd 
Dress W/h. Click on the Locator tab, and enter the information as follows:

Re-importing the chart of accounts
Now, the next important thing that needs to be done is re-importing the chart of 
accounts, along with Import File Loader and Import Account! During the Initial 
Client Setup, the system imported only 71 default accounts. Complete list of accounts 
from predefined chart of accounts will be imported along with the File Loader and 
Account, and will be internally restructured and reconfigured by ADempiere.
Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Account Element 
window. This window contains three tabs—Element, Element Value, and Sub 
Account, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 81 ]
The previous screenshot shows the initial records, that is, the records before 
performing the re-importing activity.
Import File Loader
As the AccountingUS.csv file is on the server computer, ensure that you perform 
this task on the server computer. Open the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data 
Import | Import File Loader window, and perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Select File to Load button.
2.	 Select the C:\Adempiere\data\import\AccountingUS.csv file.
3.	 Set UTF-8 in the charset (located on the right-hand side of Select File 
to Load button). In the Import Format field, select Accounting – Accounts 
from the list. 
4.	 Click on the OK button to proceed with re-importing task.
5.	 Wait for some time, and you will be prompted with the Rows in file | 
loaded and ready to import message.
Thus, the chart of accounts information will be now saved in the internal ADempiere 
temporary table that needs to be further processed, that is, by running Import Account.
Import Account
Open the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import Account window. 
As mentioned in the Record Info, it shows 1/362, which means this window contains 
362 records that need to be processed.
The first record is blank. There is no information in the Search Key, Name, 
and Account Type. These values come from the header information of your 
AccountingUS.csv file. Delete the blank record by clicking on the F3 button. 
Finally, we will have only 361 records that need to be processed.

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 82 ]
In the active records, the pointer should now be in account 1 (in the Search Key field) 
and have Assets value in its Name field, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the Import Accounts button. This will bring up an accounts confirmation 
window. Perform the following tasks: 
Enter Sistematika Fashion, Ltd in the Client field
Enter Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Account in the Element field
Select all of the Update Default Accounts, Create New Combination, and 
Delete old imported records options, and then click on the OK button
Although we processed the first records, ADempiere automatically 
processes all of the unprocessed account records in this Import 
Accounts window.

Chapter 3
[ 83 ]
Wait for some time, and it will bring up the screen shown in the following screenshot:
Ensure that we have 0 Errors in this message.
If you get an error message stating 1 Errors, in the Import 
Accounts confirmation results window, it means that you 
might not have deleted the first blank account, as mentioned 
previously. Find the first record in this window. You will see 
an ERR=No Name, ERR=No Key message in the Import Error 
Message field. You are free to delete this record.
Now, open the Account Element window. Click on the Element Value tab, select 
the Expand Tree checkbox, and you will have a complete list of accounts that has 
been properly configured.
Taking a look at the other configuration 
parts
There is so much stuff that is involved during the initial creation process. These can 
be either accounting configuration related, or entities such as calendar and periods, 
the standard user ID, default role and user ID rights, the standard ADempiere 
documents, and so on.
In this section, you will be introduced to the most important things to know.

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 84 ]
Accounting schema
Accounting schema is a standard for ADempiere, and is also the mother of all 
accounting configurations. This window will show a predefined International 
GAAP accounting Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Accrual 
or cash-based accounting, Standard Costing for costing methods, USD as its base 
currency, History and Future Days for allowing document completions, and will 
define the standard accounts that can be used as default accounts (such as Product 
Asset, Product Revenue, and so on). This can be found on the Defaults tab.
The standard account values come from the predefined AccountingUS.csv chart of 
accounts mentioned earlier.
Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Accounting Schema 
window. This window is shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 85 ]
Once the accounting schema is configured, it is better if we do not change our 
configuration during the implementation of ADempiere ERP; especially for accrual 
or cash-based accounting, costing method, costing level, and currency info.
Although we can create or register more accounting schemas, throughout this 
book, we will use only the standard predefined accounting schema. We will 
discuss this accounting schema in more detail in Chapter 7, Accounting Information 
and Configuration.
Calendar Year and Period
When creating a new client, ADempiere will create years and periods for you. When 
creating a client in the year 2009, internally ADempiere will create year 2009 and a 
list of periods from January to December. Open the Menu | Performance Analysis 
| Accounting Rules | Calendar Year and Period window. It will contain five tabs: 
Calendar, Year, Period, Period Control, and Non Business Day. You can check the 
generated calendar and periods data here.
Creating a new year and periods
If you need to create a year and periods for the year 2010 (or another year), perform 
the following tasks:
1.	 Go to the Year tab.
2.	 Click on the New button, enter 2010 in the Year field, and save your work.
3.	 Click on the Create Periods button, and then click on the OK button in the 
confirmation window.
Examine the Period tab, and all of your defined periods should be present there.
Opening document types
To open all of the document types for January 2009, click on the Calendar tab first, 
ensure that you have a record active at Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Calendar (this tab 
contains one record only), click on the Year tab, and lastly, click on year 2009. Click 
on the Period tab, and select the Jan-09 records. While you are in grid view mode, 
click on Grid Toggle button to switch to show the detailed information of any one 
record. You will find the Open/Close All button. Click on it, and enter Open Period 
in the list of the Period Action field, and click on the OK button.

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 86 ]
Examine your period control by clicking on the Period Control tab, and you will get 
all of the document types that were set up to Open in the Period Status field.
Period Closed error message
Guys, while playing with GardenWorld and creating a Sales Order, entering the 
data for both Order and Order Line went fine. The problem was, while attempting 
to 'Complete' this document, I got a Period Closed error message on the bottom 
left-hand side of the window. Can you help me with this issue?
This is a general symptom when trying to complete a document. With a Period 
Closed message and accounting schema's Automatic Period Control checkbox 
selected, it could mean one of the following:
You have not opened (or closed) the periods for such a document type—in 
this case, it is the Standard Order document type
You have not created a year calendar and the periods yet
You are setting up your transactional date outside the History Days and 
Future Days field in the accounting schema.
If we are working on the first day of a New Year, it is a quite possible that our 
ADempiere administrator has not created the New Year's record in the Calendar 
Year and Period window yet. Any action attempting to complete a document 
will fail.
•
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 87 ]
When we create a New Year and a Period, although it mentions that the 
period has a Never Opened status on the Period Control tab, we can 
continue to complete a document. It is better if we mark all periods to 
Close Period by clicking on the Open/Close All button (in the Period 
tab), select Close Period from the Period Action field, and click on the 
OK button in the confirmation window. You can open the periods later 
when needed.
Accounting processor
After creating and completing a document, such as Purchase Order and MM 
Receipt, when we select Show Accounting Tabs in Tools | Preferences, we will find 
a Not Posted (not processed yet) button. If we click on this button, ADempiere 
will post this document. Do we need to click on this button in each of our 
document transactions?
Posting document is an ADempiere task to perform accounting 
activities such as creating the necessary accounting facts or General 
Ledger journals.
Automatically posting documents
ADempiere has some features to automatically process and post documents that have 
an unposted status, without user intervention. Open the Menu | System Admin | 
General Rules | Server | Accounting Processor window. As a default, there will be 
one record with active status, blank Accounting Schema, blank Table, Frequency 
Type as Hour, and Frequency having value 1, as shown in the next screenshot:

Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client Setup
[ 88 ]
This information tells us that in every one hour, ADempiere server has a 'to do 
list' to post all of the un-posted documents that reside in all of the tables and all of 
the accounting schemas registered. Just ensure that you have already started your 
ADempiere server application, as mentioned in Chapter 1, ADempiere Installation. 
Then the accounting processor will work periodically for you behind the scene.
Although we let the ADempiere system post our document automatically, 
until we reach Chapter 5, Procurement Activities, of this book, and for 
testing purposes, we need to know on what basis are the accounting facts 
(General Ledger journal) generated within the related document. To reach 
this goal, we need to set the accounting processor to an inactive status and 
post the document manually. Deselect the Active checkbox, and click on 
the Save button. Restart your ADempiere server to ensure that the server 
reads the latest accounting processor configuration.
Common errors during manual posting
When practicing the posting of your document, sometimes you may get the message 
shown in the next screenshot:
This will be followed by a Posting Error NoAppsServer confirmation message. 
This means that you have not started your ADempiere server yet. Do not forget 
to start your ADempiere server. Wait until the application is ready, then log out 
and log back in to your ADempiere client, and finally you will be able to post 
your document.

[ 89 ]
Summary
In this chapter, we saw the example of an apparel company structure. Before setting 
up our company structure, we discussed the concept of ADempiere company 
structures. Based on this information, we mapped the sample company structure 
within ADempiere.
While creating our own client, we needed to import a pre-configured chart of 
accounts. Before this activity, we learnt how to set up a chart of accounts in a 
standard ADempiere format by using the Account Editor tool, followed by the 
creation of our own client, and reviewing the new ADempiere client.
With the help of a sample company structure, we set up additional Organizations, 
Warehouses, and Locators. As ADempiere imported only the default accounts 
when creating a new client, we continued our activities by re-importing the chart 
of accounts.
We took a look at the preliminary information of Accounting Schema, Accounting 
Processors, and how to manage a calendar year and periods.
With this successful new client set up, we are ready to use our own client. In 
the next chapter, we will discuss how to set up the prerequisite data and its 
accounting configuration.


Setting up Master Data and 
Knowing its Accounting 
Configuration
As we have a preconfigured company structure, ADempiere is ready for your test 
transaction. However, as we are using our own new ADempiere client—Sistematika 
Fashion, Ltd.—and are working with ADempiere windows such as Purchase Order, 
Sales Order, and so on, we will need to set up some master data. The examples of 
master data needed could be a list of products, a customer, a vendor, currency, 
bank account, cash book, and so on. We could also identify this master data as 
reference data.
In this chapter, you will be escorted through and learn how to set up, configure, 
and observe any existing accounting related information that is related to master 
or reference data. This chapter will introduce you to:

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 92 ]
Introduction to master data accounting 
configuration
When working with master or reference data, there is an Accounting tab within a 
window, which contains accounting configuration information. In order to become 
familiar with it, let us play with our Garden World client. Log in to GardenWorld with 
the user ID GardenAdmin and using GardenWorld Admin as the role. Make sure 
that you select the Show Accounting Tabs option in Tools | Preference.
Example of a Product's accounting 
configuration
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product 
window. This window is the place to register your product. In this window, you 
can choose one of the available products to play with. Select Azalea Bush as your 
sample product.
For this product, navigate to its accounting configuration parts by clicking on the 
Accounting tab. This contains many default account configurations, which are 
used by the Azalea Bush product. The list of information in this tab is as follows:

Chapter 4
[ 93 ]
In the previous screenshot, the Product Asset’s default account uses the 
HQ-14120-_-_-_-_ account combination. Observe the other products and examine 
their Accounting tab. Although the tab has the same information (for now), each 
product actually has its own accounting configuration parts, as shown in the 
following figure:
Product A
Product B
Product C
Account combination for
Product A including
- Product Asset
- Cost Adjustment
- Product COGS

Account combination for
Product B including
- Product Asset
- Cost Adjustment
- Product COGS
-
-
-
Account combination for
Product C including
- Product Asset
- Cost Adjustment
- Product COGS
-
-
-
With this feature, you can configure your accounting configuration parts on a 
per-product basis!
The meaning of HQ-14120-_-_-_-_
Yes, I am familiar with Product Asset, Product COGS, and so on. I just want 
to know more about the Account format in this tab. Previously, we had a list of 
accounts, which contained numbers such as 14120, 51300, 51100, and so on. 
Could you give me a better explanation of what HQ-14120-_-_-_-_ for a Product 
Asset means?
You may have experience with other ERP or accounting packages. When entering a 
General Ledger journal transaction, generally, you have to enter the data for each of 
the account dimensions. Let's say, dimension 1 for account, dimension 2 for profit 
centre, dimension 3 for cost centre, dimension 4 for product, and so on. Refer to the 
encircled area in the following screenshot for a clearer picture:

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 94 ]
With ADempiere, all of the dimension information is combined into a single 
data. The HQ-14120-_-_-_-_ is an account combination of six dimensions, such as 
organization, account, product, business partner, project, and campaign. In this account 
combination example, it means the organization is HQ, account is 14120, product 
is blank, business partner is blank, project is blank, and campaign is blank.
Do not worry about the blank information for now. If we have a transaction with a 
document such as MM Receipt (receiving material from vendor) for our products; 
information about the product, business partner, project, and campaign data will be 
provided automatically by the system, based on the information available in the MM 
Receipt document. This information will be reflected in the General Ledger journal 
generated upon posting the MM Receipt document.
This is just one example of accounting configuration for the Product window. In 
general, this concept will be applied to most of the ADempiere master or reference 
data. For another example, take a look at the Menu | System Admin | Organization 
Rules | Bank window. Select the MoneyBank record in the Bank tab. Then select 
a particular account from the Account tab, and navigate to the Accounting tab. 
Observe the predefined account combination for Bank Asset, Bank In Transit, 
Payment Selection, or other default accounts. As with Product, the Accounting 
tab information is unique for each bank Account record.
With the GardenWorld client, the account combination 
(such as the previous example for Product Asset's default 
account) will have the format HQ-14120-_-_-_-_ format. But 
with our new Sistematika Fashion, Ltd client, it will have a 
different format, such as *-14120-_-_-_-_. The * represents the 
Organization information. The real organization information 
will be entered based on the document transaction.
Account combination
We have already talked about the account combination. How do we configure or 
add the account combination itself?
Before we set up an additional account combination, we have to think about 
the purpose of the newly-created account combination. Generally, all registered 
account combinations will be used for:
Entering manual GL Journal transactions
Replacing the default account's account combination (such as the Product 
Asset default account)
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 95 ]
Common rules when creating an account 
combination
When creating a new account combination to be used for manual GL Journal 
transactions, it is important that all of the accounts that are used with your 
newly created account combination, satisfy the following criteria:
The account is not set to Summary Level
The account is not set to Document Controlled
For a list of accounts that do not have Summary Level and 
Document Controlled in their attributes, just re-observe your 
AccountingUS.xls file, or open your AccountingUS.csv chart 
of accounts file with your Account Editor tools. You can obtain this 
file from the C:\Adempiere\data\import folder.
When creating the new account combination that will be used to replace the 
default account's account combination, the account involved should have 
the following criteria:
The account is not set to Summary Level
The account is set to Document Controlled
We will practice creating our own new account combination in the 
subsequent sections.
Creating a new account combination
There are two ways to create a new account combination:
Through the Account Combination window
Through the Account Dialog window
Let us practice using the Account Combination window. Open the 
Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Account Combination 
window. With this window, the default standard ADempiere installation does 
not give us the right to create a new account combination—you may have 
observed that the New button is disabled!

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 96 ]
So, how can we add our new account combination when the system does not provide 
us with such a facility? Is there anything we need to know to perform this task?
ADempiere contains many windows, which are already configured, in its application 
dictionary. The ADempiere window can be set up using an option from the list of 
available Window Type options:
Maintain: This window allows the user to add or modify data. Most of the 
master or reference data will be maintained with a window that has this 
Window Type option. The examples of ADempiere windows that have this 
Window Type are: Product, Bank, and Cashbook.
Query Only: This window just displays information. Any action to update 
or add data is prohibited. For example, the Accounting Facts and Access 
Audit windows.
Transaction: This window is used for transactional purposes. For example, 
the GL Journal, Purchase Order, and Material Receipt windows.
The Account Combination window has a Query Only window type. To examine, log 
in to System, and using the System Administrator role, we will access our ADempiere 
Application Dictionary configuration for the Account Combination window.
Open the Menu | Application Dictionary | Window, Tab & Field window, or 
just click on the Window, Tab & Field shortcut menu. In the Lookup Record 
(search dialog) window, fill the Name field with the value Account Combination%, 
and click on either OK or the Query Enter button. While you are in the grid mode, 
click on the Grid Toggle button to show the detailed records, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
With this information, just place the cursor in the Window Type field, and select 
Maintain as the new Window Type. Save the information, and close this window. 
With this new configuration, the Account Combination window will be able to 
create new data. Now, log out from the application.
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 97 ]
As explained, with this small ADempiere application dictionary change, we will be 
able to create a new account combination. Could you please help me in the creation 
of an account combination?
Log in to GardenWorld, using user ID GardenAdmin, and GardenWorld Admin as 
the role. Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Account 
Combination window. We will practice making a combination for the 64500 - Other 
Consulting Fees account. Click on the New Record button, and enter the 
following information:
Field
Information
Alias
64500
Organization
HQ (in the option it is HQ-HQ)
Account
64500
When entering the Account information, just type 64500, and press the Tab key. The 
system will show an Info Account Element window. In this window, we can search 
for our target account by just typing the account number in the Key field. Make sure 
that you have Other Consulting Fees in the Name field and then just click on the OK 
button. Leave the Product, Business Partner, Project, and Campaign fields blank, 
and save the information.

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 98 ]
By performing this activity, we have created a new HQ-64500-_-_-_-_ account 
combination with the alias 64500. You can now use this account combination for 
your transactions. You could similarly create another account combination as per 
your requirements.
Beware! Although we have already created a HQ-64500-_-_-_-_ account 
combination, we could still create the same account combination again. 
To avoid any confusion, just ensure that you are not creating a duplicate 
account combination. Once a duplicate account combination has been 
created, you cannot delete this information. Instead, you need to set it to 
inactive by deselecting the Active checkbox, in the account combination 
is no longer used.
Changing the account combination of the 
ADempiere default account
Changing an account combination for the ADempiere default account, 
such as the Product Asset (B_ASSET_ACCT), Not-invoiced Receipts 
(NOTINVOICEDRECEIPTS_ACCT), and other default accounts, is a simple task. 
For our simulation, we will change the Product Asset default account set up for 
one of our products from HQ-14120-_-_-_-_ to HQ-17710-_-_-_-_.
Account alias
I examined all of the data inside the Account Combination window. Except for the 
newly created account combination, the account combination does not contain alias 
information. What is the exact purpose of alias information?
Alias information is used for faster searching of an account combination. Therefore, 
it can speed up our data entry. For your reference, find HQ-17710-_-_-_-_ in an 
Account Combination window (you can utilize Lookup Record, and enter 
HQ-Project% in the Description field). In the information within this window, set 
the Alias to 17710, and save your changes. We will call this account combination 
using its alias in the subsequent section.
Altering the Product Asset default account
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules 
| Product window.

Chapter 4
[ 99 ]
In order to have a sample product to work with, pick Azalea Bush as your target 
product, and perform the following tasks:
From the tabs available in the Product window, click on the Accounting 
tab. On the right-hand side of the Product Asset field, click on the small red 
button. The system will show you an account combination's Product Asset 
window (we could also call this window as the Account Dialog window).
In this window, find out and click on the Undo changes button (number 2 
in the following screenshot). Now move your pointer to the Alias field, and 
type 17710, and then click on the ReQuery button (number 1 in the following 
screenshot) to show a valid combination for the HQ organization and the 
17710 account.
We will now have an active window, as shown in the following screenshot:
Within this Account Dialog window, click on the OK button, and (right now) 
your Product Asset field has already been set to the HQ-17710-_-_-_-_ account 
combination. In order to finalize your changes, click on the Save button in 
the Accounting tab.
In the Account Dialog window, you can also create your new 
account combination. Click on the Undo changes button, search for 
your target account, set your account Alias and Organization, and 
then click on the Save button (number 3 in the previous screenshot). 
Your new account combination can now also be accessed in the 
Account Combination window.

Managing a Business Partner
With other proprietary ERP systems, if a third party such as a customer, vendor, or 
employee has a relationship with the company, then information related to the third 
party will be set up in a certain window. It is up to the ERP system to handle this 
data and manage the third-party data effectively.
ADempiere has a different approach to managing its customer, vendor, and 
employee information. In general, they all have the same data characteristics or 
attributes such as name, addresses, tax identity, and so on. If there is any specific 
information required, then ADempiere will have a special tab to set this information. 
With this flexibility, we can enter our customer, vendor, and employee information 
into just one centralized window called Business Partner.
In this window, we can set a third party to become:
Either a customer or a vendor
Both a customer and a vendor
A customer, a vendor, and also an employee
Thus, we can eliminate third-party data duplication.
Business Partner Group
During the creation of a business partner, we can group several business 
partners into one business partner group. Log in with user ID admin, open the 
Menu | Partner Relations | Business Partner Rules | Business Partner Group 
window. This window contains three tabs: Business Partner Group, Accounting, 
and Assigned Partners.
Grouping criteria
You can define a type of business partner group by yourself. For example, it can be 
divided into Retail Customers, Wholesale Customers, VIP Customers, and so on. 
Using this scenario, we can set up a business partner relationship, as shown in the 
following diagram:
Retail Customer Business Partner Group
Wholesale Customer Business Partner Group
Business Partner 3
Business Partner 2
Business Partner 1
Business Partner 4
Business Partner 5
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 101 ]
In this diagram, business partners 1, 2, and 3 will be grouped into the Retail 
Customer Business Partner Group, whereas business partners 4 and 5 will be 
grouped into the Wholesale Customer Business Partner Group.
You can specify a unique business partner group to achieve 
your specific goal.
Accounting configuration
With the availability of the Accounting tab, we can define accounting configuration 
in the business partner group. The accounting can be categorized into two parts for 
the default account as follows:
Shared default account
Private default account
Shared default account means that the default account value will be used, and it will 
become the reference account combination for all of the business partners connected 
to this business partner group. You can set up and change this default account's 
account combination value only in the Accounting tab of the Business Partner 
Group window.
Private default account means that the default account value will be used, and it will 
become the reference account combination to specific business partners.
Although you can set up and change the private default account's 
account combination value (both on the Business Partner Group 
and the Business Partner window), it is advisable that you set your 
changes only in the Accounting tab of the Business Partner window.
•
•

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 102 ]
The list of shared default accounts can be found in the sections highlighted in the 
following screenshot:
Customer Receivables, Receivable Services, Customer Prepayment, Vendor 
Liability, Vendor Service Liability, and Vendor Prepayment are categorized 
as private default accounts.
Creating a new business partner group
With our newly-created client, ADempiere provides us with one business partner 
group named Standard, and three business partner data named Standard (as our 
business partner template data), admin, and user. The last two business partners 
are our predefined ADempiere user IDs, which act as an "employee" type of 
business partner.
You can create many business partner groups. For our reference transaction, in this 
book, we will create two types of business partner groups, namely, Import and 
Local. All of our business partners residing outside our country will be grouped 
into the Import business partner group. All of our business partners residing in 
our country will be grouped into the Local business partner group.
In the existing Business Partner Group window, on the Business Partner Group tab, 
we need to enter the following information:

Chapter 4
[ 103 ]

When entering the information into all of the master data, in this

Organization to *.
Actually, there are many fields available in this tab. For our convenience, we will 
enter the information for the two fields mentioned, and leave the rest as it is.
When setting up or entering information into all of the ADempiere 
windows, there will be many fields that can be filled or set up. There are 
some color indicators, which will help us when entering information 
into these fields. All fields that are red, are mandatory fields and yet do 
not have a value entered. The fields that are blue are mandatory fields, 
which already have a value assigned. Fields which do not have a blue or 
red color assigned, can be filled with a value specified by you, or can be 
left blank.
Business Partner
Manufacturing garments such as shirts will require several raw materials. The types 
of materials include fabrics, buttons, threads, labels, and so on. Sistematika Fashion, 
Ltd. has to buy materials from several vendors. When the finished goods are ready, 
the company will ship these goods to the customers. We need to set these vendors 
and customers up using the Business Partner window.
Open the Menu | Partner Relations | Business Partner Rules | Business Partner 
window. We will learn how to set up both the vendor and the customer information 
in the following sections.

Most companies have at least one bank account and one petty cash fund to 
record and support their business activities. It seems that we need to register our 
bank account and petty cash master data in the system. Could you show me the 
ADempiere feature to manage both, the bank account and petty cash transactions?
To handle your needs, ADempiere can definitely help you manage your bank 
account and its activities. It also provides support to record your petty cash 
transactions. Here, we need to set up both, a bank account and the petty cash 
master data. There is no limitation in terms of how many bank accounts and 
petty cash accounts can be set up in the system.
In this section, you can play with and examine the accounting configuration for both 
the bank account and petty cash accounts.

Managing a Cash Book
To book a transaction related to direct cash owned by the company, such as buying 
sugar for employees' coffee or tea, lunch for company guests, or any other type 
of expenses, we shall record this kind of a transaction in the Cash Book feature 
provided by ADempiere.
Configuring your own cash book
Prior to utilizing this feature, you have to know how to set up your cash book in 
the system. Open the Menu | System Admin | Organization Rules | Cashbook 
window. With your new client installation, ADempiere comes with a default cash 
book set up named Standard.
The default cash book configuration uses USD as a default currency. The USD comes 
from our default currency, which was configured previously during the ADempiere 
client creation. Rename your cash book name from Standard to USD Cash Book.
To register another transaction in the IDR currency (in case we use currencies 
other than USD), we need to create another type of cash book. You can set the 
following information:

Take a look at the list of default accounts listed in the Accounting tab for the USD 
Cash Book, as shown in the following screenshot:
When utilizing this Cash Book feature, we can divide our transaction into two 
transaction types: 
General expenses
General receipts
When working with these types of transactions in the Cash Journal window, posting 
this document will generate the accounting facts/GL journal format, as shown in the 
following table:

Introduction to Charge
Currently, we have a specific account to determine the type of expenses. For 
example, we have an account for Postage, Newspaper, Bank Charges, Vendor 
Charges, Handling Charges, and so on. We are using these samples of accounts 
when entering petty cash transactions. With the prior information provided, the 
standard cash book General Expense transaction will be directed to the 79400 
account. How can we allocate such transactions to the proper account?
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 111 ]
Yes, you can still create that type of transaction using the ADempiere cash book. 
When you have a specific cash book requirement, instead of using General Expense, 
there is an option to use Charge while working with the Cash Journal window.
We can use Charge as an alternative that can be used to map an 
expense or even receipt allocation.
Preparing new account combinations for Charge
You need to prepare an account and create a new account combination prior to 
creating your Charge. With the standard ADempiere chart of accounts available 
(taken from AccountingUS.csv), we can choose the following accounts when 
creating the upcoming account combination:
73100 as Postage Expense account
71200 as Subscription Fees account
Open Account Combination or your Account Dialog window, and create an account 
combination for both, the 73100 and 71200 accounts. Ensure that you set 73100 as an 
alias for the 73100 account combination, and 71200 as the alias for the 71200 account 
combination, as shown in the following table:
Alias
Organization
Account
73100
Dress
73100-Postage Expense
71200
Dress
71200-Subscription Fees
Next, we need to bind this account combination to the correct Charge's 
default account.
Creating a new type of Charge
ADempiere provides the Charge window to define your own Charge. Here, you 
can create a list of charges that suit your needs. You can access this window from 
Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Charge.

I will now introduce you to the process of creating a sample of an ADempiere 
Charge for both Postage and Newspaper, using the following procedure:
1.	 Open the Charge window, click on the New button, and set the Organization 
field to *, the Name field to Postage, leave the rest as it is, and save this data. 
2.	 Click on the Accounting tab. By default, the Charge Expense and Charge 
Revenue default accounts will be filled up with the 79600 and 79700 account 
combination. Click on the small button in the Charge Expense field. Within 
the upcoming Account Dialog window, create your new 73100 account 
combination. Click on the OK button in the Account Dialog window to set 
this new account combination to the Charge Expense default account. Set 
your Charge Revenue field to the 73100 account combination.
3.	 Go back to your Charge tab, click on the New button, and set the 
Organization field to *, the Name field to Newspaper, and then save.
4.	 Click on the Accounting tab. Create a new 71200 account combination, 
and set this new account combination to its Charge Expense and Charge 
Revenue default account.
With our newly-created Charge set up, our upcoming cash journal transaction 
involving the Postage and Newspaper types of charge will generate the accounting 
facts/GL journal, as shown in the following table:

Using multiple currencies
As seen previously, the ADempiere cash book can be set up not only for one 
currency, but also for more. It seems that ADempiere has a multi-currency feature. 
What is the most important point that we need to know when implementing a 
multi-currency transaction?
Like many standard ERP systems, ADempiere has an ability to handle multi-currency 
transactions. For the prerequisites, you have to know and configure the:
Currencies that will be used
Currency conversion type, such as Spot, Average, and so on
Currency conversion rates
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 113 ]
We will learn how to manage currencies in the following sections.
Currency
Currently, you have two ADempiere clients in your system: Sistematika Fashion, 
Ltd and Garden World. While working with multiple clients, there is a standard 
feature to share information among the ADempiere clients. An example of shared 
information is Currency.
To access master data like currencies, ADempiere provides a pre-configured System 
client. There is an option to set up master or reference data in the System client. 
When setting up master data in the System client, this data should be available 
to all of your clients.
Log in to System, and set the role to System Administrator. In the main menu window, 
select the Expand Tree option. Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting 
Rules | Currency window. This window contains three tabs: Currency, Accounting, 
and Conversion Rates. With the Currency tab, you will be prompted with all of the 
registered standard currency information (in all, it's about 174 records!)
For Currency code standardization, refer to http://www.iso.org/iso/
support/currency_codes_list-1.htm.
Deactivating unneeded currencies
I am logged in to GardenWorld. While working with a sample window, such 
as Menu | Open Items | Payment, it requires a Currency for the Payment 
transaction document. I clicked an option in the Currency field, and it shows us 
tons of currency options. Well, within our daily transactions, we utilize just four 
currencies: IDR, USD, EUR, and HKD. Can we restrict the options to just four 
currency codes?
We can set a minimum list of currencies available for all of your transactions. If you 
are working with those four currencies only, you can inactivate all of the unneeded 
currencies. Log in to System, navigate to the Currency window, and deselect the 
Active checkbox for all of the unneeded currencies.
Beware! These inactive currencies will not be available to any of your 
clients. Another way to restrict the list of currencies is by implementing 
the record access security rule. We will discuss this topic in Chapter 12, 
Implementing Security.

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 114 ]
You can test the impact of inactivating currencies. Log in with user ID admin, open the 
Payment window, select the Currency field, and examine the result. The options will 
contain currency data, as shown in the following screenshot:
Currency conversion rate types
When working with multi-currencies, we are faced with a lot of methods of 
conversion. For example, Log in to System, and open the Menu | Performance 
Analysis | Accounting Rules | Currency Type window. The predefined currency 
conversion types are Average, Company, Period End, and Spot.
These are just the predefined names of the available currency conversion types. 
You are free to add more conversion rate types to fulfill your needs. For common 
manufacturing companies in Indonesia, we are familiar with two such conversion 
types: Daily and Weekly rate. The Indonesian Daily rate type is similar to the 
Average type, while the Weekly rate type is an average of rates over a week. We 
will set up two of these rate types for our currency conversion rate type.
Creating a new currency type
In the Currency Type window, enter the following information:
Field

For our upcoming test transaction, set the Average, Company, and Period End 
currency conversion rate type to inactive. Pay attention to the Spot currency type. 
Deselect the Default checkbox for this record.

Chapter 4
[ 115 ]
With all of this activity, when working with a sample transaction such as 
Payment, the Currency Type options are similar to the options shown in the 
following screenshot:
With the current standard ADempiere configuration, the Currency Type 
field is available only if we use a document currency other than the 
accounting schema currency. In the previous example, we are using IDR 
currency in the document, while the default accounting schema currency 
is USD.
Currency rates
After defining the currency conversion rate type, we need to enter the currency rates. 
Although we can set the rates in the System Client, we would prefer to set up the 
rates information in the target client.
Entering new currency rates
Log in with user ID admin, and open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting 
Rules | Currency Rate window. For simplicity, we will set up IDR rates against 
US$ 1, as shown in the following table:
Date
Rate Type 
IDR value
March 16, 2009
Daily
IDR 10000
We enter the rate shown in the table by using the following procedure:
1.	 Click on the New button. Enter IDR in the Currency field, and USD in the 
Currency to field.
2.	 Select the Active checkbox, set the Currency Type to Daily and the Valid 
from field to 03/16/2009.
3.	 Enter the value 10000 in the Divide Rate field, and press the Tab key. When 
you press the Tab key, the system will automatically fill in the value for the 
Multiply Rate field with 0.0001. Save this information.

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 116 ]
Entering reciprocal rates
Although we have already entered the IDR to USD conversion rate, we also have 
to enter a reciprocal rate as a means of entering USD to IDR conversion rates. Enter 
the following information:
1.	 Click on the New button. Enter USD in the Currency field and IDR in the 
Currency to field.
2.	 Select the Active checkbox, set the Currency Type to Daily and the Valid 
from field to 03/16/2009.
3.	 Enter the value 10000 in the Multiply Rate field, and press the Tab key. When 
you press the Tab key, the system will automatically fill the value for the 
Divide Rate field with 0.0001. Save this information.
After completing these activities, we can use this currency information for future 
transactions. Next, we will learn about how to manage product prices.
Price management
Generally, while talking about the product price, we could categorize or divide it 
into two parts: purchasing and sales price. This is just an example. We can add an 
additional type of price. I am wondering how I can manage the purchase and sales 
prices with ADempiere.
During the creation of both the Purchase Order and Standard Order documents, 
ADempiere requires a price list. With this requirement, logically, we have to 
set up a price list.
ADempiere products require a List Price, Standard Price, and Limit Price as part 
of their price list's information. The following is the meaning of the price list's parts 
associated with sales price:
List Price—is the recommended retail price.
Standard Price—is the standard price we sell at.
Limit Price—is a price limit that we will sell our products at. We cannot sell 
our products below this price.
Using the sales price list, the value taken from the List Price will be used when 
creating a Standard Order document. With this document, we can offer a discount 
price with the value taken from the Standard Price. For our loyal customers, we can 
offer a very competitive price, which is taken from the Limit Price.
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 117 ]
There are three ADempiere windows in relation to the price list. They are Price List 
Schema, Discount Schema, and Price List.
When configuring our product prices, we need to:
Create one or more Price List Schema. In the schema line, we configure the 
List Price, Standard Price, and Limit Price.
Create one or more Price List instances. Each Price List can contain one or 
more Price List Version instances.
Define and configure the Price List Version. You need to set up the Price List 
Schema as part of its information.
Continuing our configuration, we will follow the previous procedure and create a 
sample Price List Schema in the subsequent section.
Managing Price List Schema
Log in with user ID admin, and open the Menu | Material Management | Material 
Management Rules | Price List Schema window. This window contains two tabs: 
Price List Schema and Schema Line. ADempiere has a default Price List Schema 
named Standard. At the moment, this price list schema data does not have Schema 
Line information.
We can utilize Schema Line to set up and manage an intermediate price 
list configuration. With Schema Line, we can automatically calculate the 
product's Standard Price and Limit Price value, based on the product's 
List Price information. An example of a Schema Line implementation is 
covered in the The Price tab section of this chapter.
Registering a new price list schema
In the Price List Schema tab, enter the following information:

Creating a Price List
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Price 
List window. This window contains three tabs: Price List, Version, and Product 
Price. As we are not yet configuring the Product, we will only work with the first 
two tabs.

By deselecting the Sales Price list checkbox, this price list is 
acting as a purchase price list.
This tab will now contain three kinds of data: Standard comes with the default client 
installation and two of our newly created price lists, Purchase PL and Sales PL. In 
the Standard price list, you need to deselect the Default checkbox.
Creating a Price List version
Following the previous activity, we will create the price list version for both of our 
newly-created price lists.
What is the aim of the price list version creation? I still have no idea about it!
The price list version will be useful if you want to manage the history of the price list. 
Assume that the price list for the period of February is different from the price list 
for the period of January. With the price list version, we will create the price list for 
both January and February. This is just one of the possibilities of the price list version 
implementation.
For our reference, we will set up both, the purchase and sales price list versions 
for March.

Chapter 4
[ 119 ]
In the Price List tab, ensure that your active record is Purchase PL. Click on the 
Version tab, and follow this procedure:
1.	 Click on the New button, and change the Name field to the value Purchase 
PL March version. 
2.	 Set the Price List Schema field to Purchase Schema.
3.	 Set the date in the Valid from field to 03/01/2009. 
4.	 Save this information.
Next, click on the Price List tab again, and then find and set your active record to 
Sales PL. Click on the Version tab, and follow this procedure:
1.	 Click on the New button, and change the Name field to the value Sales PL 
March version.
2.	 Set the Price List Schema field to Sales Schema.
3.	 Set the date in Valid from field to 03/01/2009. 
4.	 Save this information.
The last task is to set up the product's List Price, Standard Price, and Limit Price 
values. As we do not yet have our own product, we will set up these prices later.
Product management
In ADempiere, Products is a term used for something that you buy or sell. These 
products include products sold to customers, products used in the manufacturing 
of products that are sold to customers, and products that are purchased by an 
organization. When you buy or sell a Product, it will require a price as one of the 
Product's attributes.
Product Type
Another important Product attribute is Product Type. The list of ADempiere Product 
Types and their meanings are listed as follows:
No
Product Type
Description
1
Item
Physical goods that you buy or sell: The system will set an inventory 
for these goods. For example, Shirts and Dress cloth.
2
Expense Type
Physical or non physical goods that you buy or sell: The system will 
not set an inventory for these goods. For example, stationery expenses.

Service
No physical goods are received or sent when we buy or sell this 
product type: It is just a service. For example, consulting fees.
4
Resource
This is like Service, but it is restricted in terms of availability. For 
example, hiring a consultant who will be available for a limited 
period only.

These General Ledger postings are referred to as "Accounting Facts" 
in ADempiere.
Product configuration
Activities such as Purchase Order, Sales Order, Material Receipt, Invoicing, and 
so on, require Products for their data. Could you give us an example on how to 
configure a Product?
Configuring products involves at least two ADempiere windows: the Product 
Category and Product window. As a hierarchy, the following is the relation 
between a Product Category and a Product window:
Product Category A
Product Category B
Product 1
Product 2
Product 3
Product 4
Product 5
As seen in the previous diagram, one or more products are connected to only 
one product category. You can specify the product categories based on your own 
grouping criteria. We will be grouping our products based on inventory types: 
Finished Goods or Raw Material.

Chapter 4
[ 121 ]
Creating a Product Category
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product 
Category window. This window contains three tabs: Product Category, Accounting, 
and Assigned Product. Previously, when setting up the Sistematika Fashion, 
Ltd. client, ADempiere automatically created a default product category named 
Standard. For this data, navigate to the Product Category tab, deselect the Default 
checkbox, and save the information.
We will set up two product categories: Finished Goods and Raw Material. Set the 
following information in the Product Category tab:
Field
1st data

Product Category accounting configuration
In the Accounting part, there are about ten default accounts involved. Here, you can 
set up both the Costing Method and the Costing Level.
ADempiere has a multi costing feature. To show you this feature, 
we can set up different costing methods and costing clients based on 
the product category.
In our two new product categories, we will set up a specific costing method only for 
the Raw Material product category. Follow these instructions:
1.	 Ensure that you have Raw Material as the active record in the Product 
Category tab. Navigate to the Accounting tab.
2.	 Set the Costing Method to Average PO, Costing Level to Client, and save 
this information.
Check the Costing Method and Costing Level configuration for the 
Finished Goods product category. There are no changes required for 
this product category, and most fields can be left as blank values. When 
there is no information (left blank) in the Costing Method and Costing 
Level fields, the system uses the default Costing Method and Costing 
Level values in the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | 
Accounting Schema window, which is the Standard Costing for the costing 
method and the Client for costing level.

For your reference, examine the following screenshot for the Raw Materials product 
category accounting configuration in the Accounting tab:
Keep in mind the Costing Method and Costing Level fields for now. We will discuss 
more details in our upcoming chapters.

The Sistematika Fashion, Ltd. production plant produces shirts, dresses, and jackets 
as products. Shirt products generally require at least fabric, thread, buttons, and a 
label as raw materials. With this requirement, we can set up about five ADempiere 
product data records. The first record is for the Shirt product's finished goods and 
the other four are for raw materials.
Preparing a new unit of measurement
Prior to entering our products, we need to set up the additional units of 
measurement. Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management 
Rules | Unit of Measure window. Enter the following information in the Unit of 
Measure tabs:

Save this information. 
In each of the unit of measurement records, there is a Conversion tab, 
in which you can define conversion rates between product's unit of 
measurement. For example, if you have both the Meter and Yard unit of 
measurement, according to http://www.conversion-metric.org, 
1 yard is equal to 0.9144 meters. You can define this information in the 
conversion tab.
Conversion should be recorded based on products. With this feature, 
you can define different conversion rates between yards and meters for 
different products.
We are ready to enter our own products. Open the Menu | Material Management 
| Material Management Rules | Product window. It will contain about 11 tabs. For 
our practice, we shall concentrate on only three tabs: Product, Purchasing, and Price.

The Purchasing tab
Here, you can define list price information for all of your products. We shall set up 
price information for each of our products in the Purchasing tab as follows:

Follow these tasks when entering the purchasing information:
1.	 In the Product tabs, ensure that S Fabric is an active record.
2.	 Select the Purchasing tab, click on the New button, set the information for 
S Fabric as mentioned in the previous table, and save the information.
3.	 Perform the same tasks for S Thread, S Button, S Label, and Shirt 
Finished Goods.
Related to our raw material products, this information should be 
a pre-requisite for executing Replenish reports. We will discuss 
Replenish reports later.
The Price tab
We will now set up our product price (including List Price, Standard Price, and 
Limit Price) in the Price tab. There are two methods of entering price information 
into this tab, manually or automatically. To give you an idea of how to set up 
product prices through ADempiere, we will guide you through setting up a 
purchase price list.
Manual processes: For an example of the manual method, follow these instructions:
1.	 Set the S Button as an active record in the Product tab, and navigate to the 
Price tab.
2.	 Click on the New button, and set the Price List Version field to Purchase PL 
March version.

Chapter 4
[ 125 ]
3.	 You can enter your products' prices (List Price, Standard Price, and 
Limit Price) save this information, and you are done.
Automatic processes: Next, we'll try to automatically insert or update the product's 
price information. We need to set up a Schema Line in the Price List Schema 
window to help us accomplish this task. Open the Menu | Material Management 
| Material Management Rules | Price List Schema window. Choose the Purchase 
Schema records in the Price List Schema tab, and navigate to the Schema Line tab.
Click on the New button, and enter the information listed in the following table:

List price Base
List Price
Standard price Base
List Price
Standard price Discount %

Now, proceed to the automatic price list setup of our Raw Material product 
category, and open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management 
Rules | Price List window. Select the Purchase PL record in the Price List tab, and 
then click on the Version tab. Ensure that you are now on the Purchase PL March 
version record, as shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 126 ]
Click on the Create Price List button. In the Create Price List confirmation window, 
just click on the OK button. You will get a Create Price List confirmation result 
window, which contains messages such as Selected=4, Deleted=3, Inserted=4, 
Updated=4, or something similar.
Take a look at the Price tab for four of our products. It will contain the price 
information listed in the following table:

Could you explain how ADempiere calculated this price? I want to know the 
concept behind these generated values.
Examine your Purchase Schema records in your Price List Schema window. Go 
through your Schema Line tab. As per our confguration, ADempiere will set the 
List Price information in the Price tab of the Product window from the List Price 
field in the Purchasing tab of the Product window. Take an example of the List 
Price for S Fabric, as shown in the following screenshot:
ADempiere says that you have already told me that the value for the Standard Price 
field should be taken from List Price, but at a 20% discount from the List Price value. 
So, I have given you 4 – (4 * 20%) equals to 3.2. While determining the Limit Price 
value, you have told me to set a Fixed Price and to take a value from the Fixed Limit 
Price field, which therefore configures as 0.00.

Chapter 4
[ 127 ]
Interesting! It seems that the Schema Line configuration will apply to our entire 
Raw Material product category, which has information in the Purchasing tab. How 
do we set a specific discount for, let's say, the S Fabric raw material?
We can set an additional Schema Line data for Purchase Schema records in 
the Price List Schema window. Just insert your second Schema Line record 
that contains:
1.	 The Sequence field with the value 20, the Currency Type field with the value 
Weekly, the Product Category field with the value Raw Material, and the 
Product field with value S Fabric.
2.	 Set the List Price option for both the List price Base and the Standard price 
Base fields. Fill the Standard price Discount % field with the value 5.
3.	 Set the Limit price Base field to Fixed Price, and enter 0 in the Fixed Limit 
Price field.
Click on the Create Price List button, as described previously, and examine your 
S Fabric pricing results in your Product window's Purchasing tab.
The rule for Schema Line configuration is: set the first record for generic 
rules. In our case, this will apply to the specific Product Category with 
all of the existing Business Partners and Products. The second record 
will be more specific than the first record. In our example, we just set 
it only for S Fabric. The third record should be more specific when 
comparing it with the second one, and is set for the S Fabric for a 
specific Business Partner.
Well, this is just an example to define the product price list for the Raw Material 
product category. You can also perform a similar process for your Finished Goods 
product category.
Summary
In this chapter, we saw the basic connection between master data and its accounting 
parts (if applicable). With these accounting parts, you were introduced to ADempiere 
account combinations and how to create your own account combination. With 
this account combination, you can set up or alter a predefined ADempiere default 
account for your new account combination.
You created a Business Partner with which you have a relationship when operating 
the company. We also know how the accounting configuration works. Also, we 
introduced a topic on how to manage our company's financial activity, including 
bank accounts and cash books.

Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration
[ 128 ]
While we were working with multiple currencies, instead of using all of the registered 
currency, we activated only a small number of currencies. This was followed by the 
creation of the currency rate type and the currency rate for our currency. With this 
currency configuration, we can now use this data for our transactions.
In the next part, we showed you how to configure a price list for our products, and 
how to configure the price list schema and its impact on the Product's price list. Prior 
to this discussion, we saw how to setup both a Product Category and a Product. The 
ADempiere Product can contain both physical goods and non physical goods, such 
as services.
In the next chapter we will show you how to perform procurement activities 
using the master data in our sample transaction, and also show you how our 
accounting configuration takes place during the generation of accounting facts/GL 
journal entries.

Procurement Activities
As a company, Sistematika Fashion, Ltd., produces its finished goods using two 
methods: make to order and make to stock. With make to stock, the company will 
produce the goods and keep the finished goods in their warehouse prior to the 
sales activity.
We will practice a make to stock activity and learn how to perform tasks related to this 
activity (especially the procurement parts) step-by-step, and will see the result in our 
accounting fact/General Ledger journal entry generation. In short, we will practice 
the following activites:
Purchase Requisition
Purchase Order
Receiving material
Managing Vendor Invoice
Performing a Vendor Payment
Reconciling a Vendor Payment
Before we start working on these activities, we will begin by introducing you to the 
ADempiere Document.
Introduction to the ADempiere Document
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd. has many activities that need to be done when running 
their business. Examples of these activities are:
The Purchasing staff making a Purchase Order document
The Warehouse staff receiving material from the Vendor
The Accounting staff registering the incoming Vendor Invoices and 
making a payment
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Procurement Activities
[ 130 ]
The Production staff creating finished goods from the available material
The Shipping staff performing the shipment of finished goods to 
the Customer
The Accounting staff creating an invoice document for the Customer
On the other hand, the Accounting department has some additional responsibilities, 
such as:
Entering manual general ledger journal entries for all of the documents
Recording account payables for existing vendor invoices
Recording account receivables for existing customer invoices
We can interpret these activities as a list of standard business processes in 
the company.
Fortunately, ADempiere can help us simplify these activities through the use of 
the existing ADempiere Document. The ADempiere Document encapsulates the 
complexity of each of the business processes (such as Purchase Order, Receiving 
Material, Invoicing, and so on) and provides a window or form to enter data related 
to the business process (such as Sales Order, Material Receipt, Invoice (Vendor), and 
so on).
With the ADempiere Document, posting the document generates the necessary 
general ledger journal entries, and you can create some reports based on the 
general ledger entries.

Working on a Purchase Requisition
As a part of the organization's internal financial controls, the organization may use 
a purchase requisition to help manage requests for purchases. With this activity, 
the request for the purchase of goods is documented and can be monitored.
There are two ways of creating an ADempiere requisition document:
Manual entries
Performing a replenish report
Creating a Purchase Requisition manually
With manual entries, you could log in with user ID admin, using Shirt as the 
Organization and 1st Shirt W/h as your Warehouse. Open the Menu | 
Requisition-To-Invoice | Requisition window, enter the data in the Requisition 
and Requisition Line tabs, fill all of the mandatory fields, complete the document, 
and you are done. Although this window has Requisition as its name, you need 
to ensure that you are using Purchase Requisition as the Document Type of the 
ADempiere document.
The following is an example of the data entered in the Requisition tab in the 
Requisition window:
•
•

Procurement Activities
[ 132 ]
We will ���������������������������������������������������������������������������
create a purchase requisition that uses the replenish report method in the 
following sections.
Working with Replenish Reports
We can create a purchase requisition document using the Replenish Reports 
feature. There is some configuration that needs to be done prior to executing 
Replenish Reports.
The following is just an example of running Replenish Reports without the correct 
configuration. Open the Menu | Material Management | Replenish Report process 
window. In the upcoming confirmation window, enter the following values:
Field
Value
Warehouse
Shirt W/h (select from the options)
Create
Requisition (select from the options)
Document Type
Purchase Requisition (select from the options)
Click on the Start button to proceed with the generation of the Replenish Reports. 
Wait for a while, and you will then be prompted with blank Replenish Report 
results. Blank reports!
Setting up replenish information
Is this feature not working, or is there any condition or configuration that needs to 
be set up to successfully create a Replenish Report?
Behind the scenes, ADempiere will read a replenish configuration within the 
Replenish tab of a Product window. Through this tab, there are several replenish 
types that we can use to achieve our target. For example, we can set up a reorder 
below a minimum level.
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product 
window. Select your S Button raw material. Using this record, click on the Replenish 
tab, and perform the following tasks:
1.	 Click on the New button, and enter the value 1st Shirt W/h in the 
Warehouse field.
2.	 Set the Replenish Type field to Reorder below Minimum Level.
3.	 Set the Minimum Level field to 200, and then click on the Save button.

Chapter 5
[ 133 ]
Setting up the default Price List
Ok, after setting up this record, I ran the Replenish Report again. But, it still shows 
me nothing! Is there any error information in ADempiere that you could share 
with me?
Unfortunately, ADempiere does not prompt us with any information to find 
out what the problem may be. However, even though there seems to be no 
error information available, you can still find out what has happened within 
the ADempiere system. You can access any error information from the Tools | 
Preference main menu. In this window, you will find the Errors tab, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
Here, ADempiere shares with us the information that an error occurred while 
entering the purchase requisition information in the M_Requisition database 
table (the first error information displayed).
M_Requisition is a table used by the Requisition window. 
Check your Record Info in the Requisition window. While 
inserting information, ADempiere says, ERROR: null value 
in column "m_pricelist_id" (second error information). This 
means ADempiere requires information in the m_pricelist_id 
field. And yes, for most ADempiere users, this is not a 
user-friendly error message format.
Delving into the ADempiere internal procedure, this message occurs while we have 
no default price list within our price list records. To rectify this problem, we need to set 
Purchase PL as our default price list. Open the Menu | Material Management | 
Material Management Rules | Price List window. Select Purchase PL as your active 
record. Edit this record, select the Default checkbox, and then save this record.

Procurement Activities
[ 134 ]
Now, you can run your Replenish Report again, and it will show you a purchase 
requisition successfully created, as shown in the following screenshot:
Completing the replenish information
Although this Replenish Report works only for the S Button material, we need to 
ensure that the Replenish Reports are created for all of our raw material. Open the 
Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Requisition window to access our newly-created 
requisition. For now, press the F3 key to delete this requisition data.
You can enter the following data for the other raw materials' replenish configuration:
Field\Raw Material
S Fabric
S Thread
S Label
Warehouse
1st Shirt W/h
1st Shirt W/h

Replenish Type

Upon completion, execute the Replenish Reports once again, and examine the 
results in the Requisition window. You will see you one requisition document 
containing four requisition lines. Complete this requisition document by clicking 
on the Complete button.
The Replenish Report is not a full Material Requirements Planning 
(MRP) implementation.
Accounting facts
While you are logged in to ADempiere using the admin user ID and Sistematika 
Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, you have the rights to access all of the accounting 
configuration and information. With this role, after completing a document, you 
will be shown a Not Posted button in the window:

Chapter 5
[ 135 ]
In your current record in the Requisition window, click on the Not Posted button. 
You will get a Post now and create Accounting entries? confirmation window. 
Once you click on the OK button, the Not Posted button becomes a Posted button.
As expected, Requisition does not generate accounting facts. To check this, click on 
the Posted button. You will be prompted with the Account Viewer window. This 
window contains two tabs: Enter Query and View Results. The View Results tab 
will contain nothing.
For other window processes, if you need to check the accounting 
facts/GL journal entries generated, you can click on the Posted button, 
and the system will show the Account Viewer window that contains 
the accounting facts information (if any).

Procurement Activities
[ 136 ]
Working with Purchase Orders
According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_order):
A purchase order is a commercial document issued by a buyer to a seller, indicating 
types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services the seller will provide 
to the buyer. Sending a purchase order to a supplier constitutes a legal offer to buy 
products or services.
Creation of a purchase order document can be done in two ways:
Manual entries
Transfer data from purchase requisition document
Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Purchase Order window. There will be 
five tabs: Purchase Order, PO Line, Matching, Requisition Lines, and Order Tax. If 
the Show Advanced Tabs checkbox is in a deselected state in Tools | Preference, then 
this Purchase Order window will only show three tabs: Purchase Order, PO Line, 
and Order Tax. We will work with the first two tabs.
On entering information in the Purchase Order window, you need to set a document 
type, which should be used in this window. There are two document types available 
in this window:
Purchase Order
Vendor Return Material
The Vendor Return Material document type should be used if you 
need to create a delivery note document when returning a material to 
your vendor.
Creating a Purchase Order manually
With manual entries, you need to set the information in the Purchase Order tab 
as follows:
1.	 Set the Target Document Type to Purchase Order.
2.	 Set your Date Ordered, target Warehouse for material received, Business 
Partner, and Price List to be used, as necessary.
3.	 In the PO Line tab, you may set the following information:
Date Promised is a required/expected date to receive the 
material ordered.
Product, Quantity, and Price.

Chapter 5
[ 137 ]
We believe that manually entering a purchase order would be an easy task for you to 
perform. Just enter the information in both, the Purchase Order and PO Line. Save 
and complete this information, and you are done.
Creating a Purchase Order from a Purchase 
Requisition
We are now trying to convert our purchase requisition document to a purchase 
order. All you need to do is to execute the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Create 
PO from Requisition process. In the displayed confirmation window, enter the 
following information:
Complete the Organization field with the value Shirt
Complete the Warehouse field with the value 1st Shirt W/h
Leave the other fields unchanged. Click on the Start button. Wait for a moment, 
and the system will automatically create the Purchase Order document for you. 
Upon completion, you will get the confirmation window, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Now, open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Purchase Order window. 
Congratulations! You will get your four purchase order documents that have a 
Drafted document status. Examine your purchase order and the purchase order 
lines. There is no need to alter any information for now.
In these purchase order documents, click on the Prepare button. You will be 
prompted with a Document Action confirmation window. Select Complete from 
the document action option list, and click on the OK button. The Prepare button 
will now change its status from Prepare to Close. Perform the same tasks for the 
rest of the purchase order documents (three documents in all).

Procurement Activities
[ 138 ]
Accounting facts
If the purchase order document has a Completed status, then there will be a Not 
Posted button available. Click on the Not Posted button to post all four of our 
purchase order documents.
With the default ADempiere configuration, the system does not generate the 
accounting fact/GL journal entries for all of these purchase order documents.
Receiving material
In other proprietary ERP systems, we can perform a material receipt if we have a 
reference to the Purchase Order document. In such cases, if we are receiving goods 
without the Purchase Order mentioned in the delivery notes, we have to contact 
our purchasing department to clarify the Purchase Order this material belongs to. 
In ADempiere, will it take time to complete this activity?
Fortunately, ADempiere has the capability to perform the material receipt activity 
with or without prior knowledge of the Purchase Order document. While we 
can process without the knowledge of the Purchase Order document, at the time 
of receiving the materials or goods, we can put this transaction in the system 
immediately, without any delay.
To work with activities related to receiving materials, ADempiere provides the 
Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Material Receipt window. This window 
contains five tabs: Material Receipt, Receipt Line, Confirmations, Matched POs, 
and Matched Invoices.
In this window, there are two document types available:
MM Receipt
MM Returns
For performing activities related to receiving materials, we will use the MM Receipt 
document type.
The MM Returns document can be used for returning raw material 
from our warehouse to the vendor.
To understand the basic material receipt activities, we will perform a material receipt 
with a purchase order reference, in the following section.
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 139 ]
Receiving materials with a Purchase Order 
reference
We will practice on our S Button and S Label purchase order. In your

Leave the other fields unchanged. After saving this information, ensure that the 
active material receipt record is Ching Fung Apparel Accessories, Ltd.
Because we have a Purchase Order reference, we can click on the Create lines from 
button, as shown in the following screenshot:

Procurement Activities
[ 140 ]
In the upcoming window, you have to:
1.	 Select a Purchase Order from the option list related to this material receipt.
2.	 Select the checkbox in the Select field for our target Purchase Order line 
(PO Line).
3.	 Complete the activity by clicking on the OK button.
With this activity, ADempiere will:
Copy the PO Line source data, and put it in your material receipt's Receipt 
Line record.
Set a flag to indicate that this material receipt is already associated with 
a Purchase Order line. Take a look at the Purchase Order field within the 
Material Receipt tab.
When performing a partial receipt of your purchase order quantity, 
you are free to alter or update the Receipt Line quantity field. In our 
case, we are receiving the full quantity.
After examining your Receipt Line data, go back to the Material Receipt tab, and 
click on the Complete button to finalize our activity.
You can proceed with the same procedure while processing the material receipt from 
Wilson Garment Accessories, Ltd.

accept the default date for both the fields, leave the other fields unchanged, and then 
save your data.

Procurement Activities
[ 142 ]
Next, we need to manually enter our material receipt line. Ensure that your material 
receipt active record is for the Hempel China Limited business partner, and click on 
the Receipt Line tab. Enter the following information for the received material:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Fabric.
2.	 Set the Locator field to Loc S1A.
3.	 Set the Quantity field to 100.
4.	 Set the UOM field to Meter.
5.	 Click on the Save button.
You can set the order reference field with the transaction reference 
number, taken from the vendor delivery notes document.
Go back to the Material Receipt tab. Set your material receipt active record to the 
Coats and Clarks business partner, and then click on the Receipt Line tab. Enter 
the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field with S Thread.
2.	 Set the Locator field with Loc S1A.
3.	 Set the Quantity field with 50.
4.	 Set the UOM field to Cone.
5.	 Click on the Save button.
Along with the previous two activities, you now have two MM Receipt documents 
that have one receipt line each. Complete both of these documents by clicking on 
the Complete button.
Posting error
When I try posting this document by clicking on the Not Posted button, I get the 
message shown in the following screenshot. In addition to this error message, the 
button flag now changes from Not Posted to Posting Error. Is there something 
wrong with our procedure?

Chapter 5
[ 143 ]
You may have also seen a similar posting error when trying to post the MM Receipt 
documents for S Thread. This is a normal warning given by ADempiere.
Previously, we set up an Average PO costing method for all of our raw materials 
(refer to the Product Category accounting configuration section in Chapter 4, Setting up 
Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration). For this costing method, upon 
posting the procedure, ADempiere requires a cost value for our received material. 
As we have no reference to a Purchase Order document, ADempiere failed to find 
the proper cost, and raised an error message.
Matching a Purchase Order to a Receipt
So, what should I do to rectify this problem?
This is a trivial task. The problem has been correctly mentioned—the MM Receipt 
document does not have a link or a reference to the Purchase Order document. You 
need to create a link between the MM Receipt document (information in the material 
receipt line, to be precise) and the Purchase Order document (information in the 
purchase order line, to be precise).
Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Matching PO-Receipt-Invoice form, 
and enter the following information:
1.	 Set the Match From field to Purchase Order.
2.	 Set the Match To field to Receipt.
3.	 Set the Search Mode field to Not Matched.
4.	 Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited.

Click on the Search records button, and ADempiere will give you a list of data 
(available in the Purchase Order grid), which needs to be linked, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
Within this example form, I have clicked on 800000 in the Document No column 
(this may vary depending on your data) in the Purchase Order data grid. By clicking 
on this record, ADempiere will show an eligible record that is available for manual 
matching, in the Receipt data grid, as shown in the following screenshot:
Select the record (by selecting the checkbox on the left-hand side of the Document 
No field), and proceed by clicking on the Process button. By performing this activity, 
you have set up a manual matching for the S Fabric material receipt.
Perform the same tasks for the S Thread material receipt. You can set the same form 
information for Match From, Match To, and Search Mode. Set the Business Partner 
field to Coats and Clarks, and continue.

This will contain four records that represent the interconnection or relationship 
among four purchase order lines with the material receipt lines document. The 
following is an example of the matched records for our S Fabric product:
The aim of using this document is as follows:
It shows the relationship between the Purchase Order line and the Material 
Receipt line information. You can evaluate the matching document 
information in this window.
On posting the Matched Purchase Order document, the system will check 
the costing methods of the Product mentioned in this document. When using 
Standard Costing as the product's costing method, if there is any variance 
between the product's Standard Cost and the product's Purchase Order price, 
the system will book a price variance.
Performing a manual Matching Purchase Order - Receipt can 
incidentally set an incorrectly-matching document. You can identify 
them within this window and take action to remove these records by 
clicking on the Delete button (in this window, you cannot remove 
records by pressing the F3 key). Then you can set a correct relationship 
with the Matching PO-Receipt-Invoice form again.

Managing vendor invoices
On sending an ordered raw material, usually our vendor sends us a document called 
an Invoice. An Invoice is a commercial document issued by a seller to the buyer, 
indicating the products, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services that 
the seller has provided to the buyer. An invoice indicates that the buyer must pay 
the seller, according to the payment terms.
When working with an invoice from your vendor, sometimes the invoice document 
will not be available at the time of receiving raw material. This invoice will be 
available to you later or it will be presented prior to receiving the raw material.
Like the material receipt activity, ADempiere has flexibility when entering an invoice 
from a vendor or supplier. You can create an invoice document with or without 
knowing the MM Receipt document reference.

Procurement Activities
[ 148 ]
We shall practice entering the invoice issued by our vendor, with and without the 
Material Receipt document reference. Here, we will be working with the Menu | 
Requisition-to-Invoice | Invoice (Vendor) window. By default, this window will 
contain eight tabs: Invoice, Invoice Line, Landed Cost, Landed Cost Allocation, 
Matched POs, Matched Receipts, Invoice Tax, and Allocation.
If the Show Advanced Tabs checkbox in Tools | Preference has 
been deselected, the Invoice (Vendor) window will only show three 
tabs: Invoice, Invoice Line, and Invoice Tax.
There are two document types available in the Target Document Type field in 
this window:
AP Invoice
AP Credit Memo
In our case, we will use the AP Invoice document type.
AP Credit Memo can be used to create a commercial document issued 
by a seller to a buyer. It will list the products, quantities, and agreed 
prices for the products or services that the seller has provided to the 
buyer, but that the buyer did not receive or return the products.
Invoicing with a Material Receipt reference
We shall practice invoicing with a Material Receipt reference using S Button and 
S Label as references. In your Invoice (Vendor) window, you should enter and 
set the following information, one-by-one, in the Invoice tab:

Leave the other fields unchanged. After saving this information, ensure that you are 
now working with the invoice that has Ching Fung Apparel Accessories, Ltd. as the 
business partner (in this example, this is the first data), and set this invoice as your 
active record. With the material receipt reference, you can just click on the Create 
lines from button, as shown in the following screenshot:

ADempiere will show an Invoice Create lines from window confirmation. Proceed 
with the following procedure:
1.	 In the Receipt field, just select an option from the list.
2.	 Select your targeted Material Receipt line records in the Select checkbox.
3.	 Finalize the process by clicking on the OK button.
In our simulation, the Receipt option contains only one list. In a real 
life scenario, it might contain more than one receipt list and more 
than one material receipt lines.

In the Create lines from activity, ADempiere copies the Material Line source data 
and puts it in your Invoice (Vendor), Invoice Line record internally. It will take the 
price from the product price list. Of course, with your Invoice Line data, you will 
still be able to alter all of the necessary information when needed. Again, for 
our simplicity, we are keeping the original information.

You can set the Date Invoiced and Account Date field information. However, 
just leave the default date information as it is for now, and leave the other 
fields unchanged.
Like other manual entries transactions, we need to enter the detailed invoice 
information. In the Invoice tab, ensure that your active invoice record has Hempel 
China Limited as a business partner. Click on the Invoice Line tab, and enter the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Fabric.
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 100.
3.	 Set the UOM field to Meter.
4.	 Set the Price field to 3.80.
5.	 Click on the Save button.
Here, you can set a payment method used for this invoice. The default setting is to 
use check as the payment rule. There is a Check button on the Invoice tab, which 
can be clicked on to change your payment rule.
Now, go back to the Invoice tab, and choose your second invoice (the one that 
has Coats and Clarks as a business partner). Enter the following information in 
the Invoice Line tab:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Thread.
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 50.
3.	 Set the UOM field to Cone.
4.	 Set the Price field to 1.60.
5.	 Click on the Save button.
Prior to entering the information, ensure that you enter the Quantity, 
UOM, and Price information, as explicitly mentioned in the invoice 
document that comes from the Vendor.
In our simulation, all of the information in our Purchase Order document is the 
same, and it contains only one invoice line. In your real life situation, the Quantity, 
UOM, and Price might differ from the Purchase Order and may contain more than 
one invoice line.
Set the active tab to Invoice, and complete both of the Invoice (Vendor) documents 
by clicking on the Complete button.

After completing this document, as usual, there will be a Not Posted button 
that appears on your window. Click the Not Posted button to post both of 
your Invoice (Vendor) documents.
In the Material Receipt activity that we previously saw, we cannot post our 
Material Receipt document if there is no reference to a Purchase Order document 
and we are using Average PO as the product's costing method. Is it also applicable 
for Invoice (Vendor)?
The answer is no. Although we do not have a reference to the Purchase Order or 
MM Receipt document, we will still be able to post the invoice document.
We can practice by posting the AP Invoice document, which has Hempel China 
Limited as a business partner. The accounting fact/GL journal entries generated 
results should be as shown in the following screenshot:
Next, you need to post the Coats and Clarks invoice, and examine the accounting 
facts/GL journal entries generated for this AP Invoice document.
Matching an Invoice to Material Receipt 
documents
By invoicing without the material receipt reference, we have to create a manual link 
from the vendor invoice to its material receipt. You will perform this task in the 
Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Matching PO-Receipt-Invoice form.
To match our invoice to its material receipt, set the following information:
1.	 Set the Match From field to Invoice.
2.	 Set the Match To field to Receipt.
3.	 Set the Search Mode field to Not Matched.
4.	 Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited.

Chapter 5
[ 153 ]
Click on the Search records button in the form, and ADempiere will show you a 
list of invoices that matched the criteria specified and that need to be processed 
further. Click on an available invoice line data (in the Invoice grid), and ADempiere 
will show you the eligible material receipt line records that you can proceed with 
(in the Receipt grid). Select the material receipt record, and click on the Process 
button to finalize our matching procedure.
The steps to proceed with this task are almost the same as matching a 
material receipt to a purchase order using the Matched Purchase Orders 
window, as mentioned in the Matching a Purchase Order to a Receipt section.
You should process the invoice that belongs to the Coats and Clarks business 
partner by using the same procedure.
Evaluating Matched Invoices
When performing an activity such as:
Manually matching an AP Invoice to an MM Receipt document using the 
Matching PO-Receipt-Invoice form
Entering invoice line information by clicking on the Create lines from button 
in the Invoice (Vendor) window
behind the scenes, ADempiere creates a matched invoice record. The record serves 
the following purposes:
It shows the relationship between the Invoice Line and Material Receipt 
Line information. You can evaluate the matching document information 
in this window.
The system will book a price variance (if any) between the Invoice Line 
product price and Purchase Order Line product price.
You can access these records in the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Matched 
Invoices window.
With the prior invoice entry activities, this will result in four Matched Invoices 
records: two from manually matching invoice—material receipt (the S Fabric and 
S Thread invoices, which were taken from the Hempel China Limited and Coats 
and Clarks business partners) and two from creating vendor invoices with material 
receipt reference by clicking on the Create lines from button in the Invoice (Vendor) 
window (the S Button and S Label invoices, which were taken from the Ching Fung 
and Wilson Garment business partners).

For example, select the records that have S Fabric as a product from the list 
of available Matched Invoices records, and post this document. The accounting 
facts/GL journal entries generated is shown in the following screenshot:
If we do not have a product price variance, as is the case in our S Fabric example, 
ADempiere only generates a debit Not invoiced receipt and a credit Product Inventory 
Clearing. Now you are free to post the rest of the Matched Invoices documents.
The debit or credit Invoiced Price Variance will be present if there is 
any product price variance between our AP Invoice document and 
Purchase Order document. The debit or credit position of the Invoiced 
Price Variance depends on whether the invoice price is less than or 
more than the purchase order price.
Summary of Material Receipt and Invoice

Making a payment to the vendor
After booking our AP Invoice document in the Invoice (Vendor) window, we admit 
that we have some liabilities to four of our vendors. As a company common behavior, 
the payment method could be set to use the company bank account, or to make 
payment by cash. It is up to the company to choose the desired payment method.
In our example, we have four invoices that we need to pay. Of course, for a real 
company, there will be hundreds or even thousands of invoices. ADempiere can 
accommodate both bank account and cash transaction payment methods. In the 
following sections, we will practice both of these payment methods.
Outstanding liabilities
The easiest way to check Sistematika Fashion, Ltd.'s liabilities is by accessing your 
Business Partner window. Open your Menu | Partner Relations | Business Partner 
Rules | Business Partner window, and point your record to Hempel China Limited 
in the Business Partner tab, as shown in the following screenshot:
With this information, ADempiere tells us the value of the total liabilities that we 
have in the Open Balance field. The value is -380. If we have more than one invoice 
that belongs to this vendor, the Open Balance will sum up all of the liabilities to this 
vendor. In this case, we have one unpaid AP Invoice document for Hempel China 
Limited, which has 380 as the invoice value.
If we have liabilities, the Open Balance will show a negative value.

Chapter 5
[ 157 ]
Payment Selection
Imagine that we have several outstanding invoices for Hempel China Limited, and 
we need to schedule how much money to spend for such payments.
Creating a list of unpaid invoices
ADempiere provides us with a report to show a list of unpaid invoices. You can 
display this list by using Menu | Open Items | Open Items reports. Click on this 
report, deselect the Sales Transaction checkbox, and then click on the OK button. As 
a result, the system will show you reports. Click the Next Page button to go to page 
two, as shown in the following screenshot:
We can choose one-by-one from a list of our outstanding unpaid invoices that 
need to be set for a payment. The task of manually selecting the records could be 
exhausting when we have hundreds of invoices. Fortunately, instead of preparing a 
manual payment by yourself, ADempiere has a feature to automatically create a list 
of payment drafts or payment proposals for you.
Creating a payment proposal
If I want to see all of the outstanding invoices that need to be set for payment, 
ADempiere gives me a list of outstanding invoices. From the upcoming list of 
outstanding invoices, ADempiere still needs my decision to approve the payment. 
Here, could I set a full or partial payment, or even not process the payment by 
removing invoices from the list of payment proposal?
You use the Menu | Open Items | Payment Selection window to perform this 
activity. Using this window, we can proceed with the payment proposal for Hempel 
China Limited for our example. 
You can now open this window. This window will contain three tabs: Payment 
Selection, Payment Selection Line, and Prepared Payment.

Opening this window will automatically set the status record to the 
Inserted state. With this state, there is no need to click on the New button 
to enter our data. However, you can click on the New button just in case 
you are not in the Inserted state.
In the Payment Selection tab, set the Name field to PS Hempel 093009 and the Bank 
Account field to USD-1-001-888888, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the Save button. We need to enter a list of invoices that need to be paid, 
in the payment selection line. For our practice, we can create a list of invoices 
by clicking on the Create From button. ADempiere will show us a confirmation 
window. In this window, set the following information:
1.	 Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited.
2.	 Deselect the Only Discount checkbox.
3.	 Select the Only Due checkbox.
4.	 Set the Payment Rule to the blank option.
5.	 Click on the OK button to proceed with a Payment Selection.
With our sample data (which has four outstanding invoices), the Payment Selection 
Line tab will contain one outstanding invoices record (it might vary with your 
installation) for Hempel China Limited.

Chapter 5
[ 159 ]
As previously explained, in the available Payment Selection Line data, we are free 
to do one of the following: 
Set a full amount payment
Enter a certain amount in the Payment amount field for partial payment
Remove this record from the Payment Selection Line
However, we do not touch the result of the Create From process. This means that we 
will set a full payment for one invoice of Hempel China Limited.
There is one last thing we need to do before we proceed to our Payment Selection. 
In the Payment Selection tab, we can click on the Prepare Payment button to finalize 
the tasks. In the upcoming Create Prepared Payments to be paid confirmation 
window, to support further processing, you need set the Overwrite Payment Rule 
to Check, and click on the OK button.
Payment Print/Export
In the previous Payment Selection activity, because we are using Check as our 
payment rule, we need to print our Check. Open the Menu | Open Items | 
Payment Print/Export window.
Ensure that you select PS Hempel 093009 – 380.00 as your Payment Selection, as 
shown in the following screenshot
Here, you can set your bank check number in the Document No field. For our 
example, you should supply 778899 as your bank check number, and click on

After printing the bank check document, ADempiere internally creates an AP 
Payment document with a Completed status. You can access this document in the 
Menu | Open Items | Payment window. This Payment window contains three tabs: 
Payment, Allocate, and Allocations.
There are two types of document type here:
AP Payment
AR Receipt
In this discussion, ADempiere automatically uses AP Payment as its document type. 
We will discuss and set an AR Receipt document implementation later.
If you need to create a manual Payment document, you can directly 
enter your data in this window. Just ensure that you use the AP Payment 
document type with your new records.

Viewing payment allocation
In the previous payment activity, the accounting facts or journal entry was generated 
by using 21300 – Payment selection in the journal debit position. We have not yet 
touched the Account Payable account.
Logically, with such an AP Payment transaction, our vendor liabilities should be 
deducted. Why is it not going to the Account Payable account directly?
ADempiere has its own workflow for working with AP Payment documents. After 
completing an AP Payment document, the system automatically generates the 
Payment Allocation document. As indicated by the document name, the aim of this 
document is to show us the AP Invoice in which the payment has been allocated.
You can access this Payment Allocation document in the Menu | Open Items 
| View Allocation window. In the Allocation tab, find the document that has 
Payment: 778899 [n] as its description (it could vary with your results). Go to 
the Allocation Line tab to see the list of AP Invoice documents applicable to this

Bank Statement
In the previous AP Payment document, the credit accounting facts generated was 
Checking In-Transfer. In-Transfer? As far as I know, performing a payment should 
be deducted from our asset (bank account in this case). It seems this is not a real 
Asset type of account. Is this a mediator or a clearing account?
Yes, you are correct. This is a clearing account. The real Checking account journal 
entries (member of the Asset type of account) will be generated when we print an 
ADempiere Bank Statement document.
The aim of the ADempiere Bank Statement document is to reconcile your 
ADempiere bank account transaction against your banking statement.
On request, the company can print their bank statement. They can go to the bank 
customer service and take this bank statement document. Furthermore, if you 
have online banking access, you can get your bank statement through your 
banking website.
On receiving your bank statement document, you can start a reconciliation 
activity by entering this information into the ADempiere Bank Statement window. 
You can access the ADempiere Bank Statement window at Menu | Open Items | 
Bank Statement.
Entering Bank Statement information
Now, open the Bank Statement window. This will contain two tabs: Bank 
Statement and Statement Line. To set our bank statement information, 
enter the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to the value Shirt.
2.	 Set your Bank Account reconciliation target. In our example, set the Bank 
Account field to USD-1-001-888888.
3.	 Set the Name field to First Bank Statement. For our example, set your bank 
account Beginning Balance to 1000.
5.	 Click on the Save button.

Chapter 5
[ 163 ]
Entering a Bank Statement Line
Navigate to the Statement Line tab. In this tab, normally we will enter all of our 
bank statements, which were previously taken from our bank customer service or 
online banking access. This bank statement might contain transactions such as:
Payment to our vendor
Receipts from our customer
Cash transfer to or from a bank account
Bank charges
Bank interest
These five types of transactions can be managed by ADempiere out of the box.
For our Hempel China Limited payment, within the Bank Statement Line tab, you 
should enter your bank statement information as follows:
1.	 Set the Statement Line date, Account Date, and Effective Date fields to 
09/30/2009.
2.	 Set the Statement Amount to -380. This information represents the amount in 
the bank account.
3.	 Next, we need to reconcile the Statement Amount value with our 
ADempiere bank account transaction. Select your payment data by clicking 
on the Payment field. In the upcoming Payment Info confirmation window, 
you have to deselect the Receipt checkbox, which indicates that we will 
be choosing our payment transaction to the vendor. Within the available 
payment list, select an appropriate record, and click on the OK button.
4.	 Enter your necessary Reference No or Memo.
Save your information.
In this activity, we actually entered data from the bank statement, and set the 
reconciliation with our ADempiere bank account transaction (Payment field). Now, 
you need to finalize this document by clicking on the Complete button in the Bank 
Statement tab.
With your real company bank statement data, you will enter all of the bank 
statements and perform the necessary reconciliation.
To speed up your bank statement entry, you can use the Create lines 
from button in the Bank Statement tab. You can make a selection of 
in transit transactions against the bank account selected in the header, 
from here. For this task, you need to enter a transaction that is not yet 
available in the bank account transactions.

Cash payment
We have two purchase orders left for payment, Ching Fung Apparel Accessories for 
S Button, and Wilson Garment Accessories for S Label. With these purchase orders, 
we will proceed to the payment using the available cash in Sistematika Fashion, Ltd. 
Open the Menu | Open Items | Cash Journal window. This window contains two 
tabs: Cash Journal and Cash Line.
Cash Type
In our old application, while we were working with a cash transaction (for example, 
money spent on food expenses), our transaction used to consist of entering an 
account for food expenses against an account for cash/petty cash. How do I perform 
such a transaction?
With ADempiere, all of the transactions related to cash will be booked with the help 
of the cash type. There is no need to book these like the traditional general ledger 
transaction mentioned previously. In general, there are six cash types available:
Bank Account Transfer: Used for activities related to transfers to and from a 
bank account.
Charge: Used to book specific charges, such as Newspaper and Postage 
expenses. You can set up a many types of charges as you like. 
Difference: Used to book any cash variances.
General Expenses: Used to book general expenses. These expenses shall 
affect only one account and are not as flexible as the Charge cash type.
General Receipts: Used to book general receipts, and affect to one 
account only.
Invoice: Used to book any cash transaction related to an invoice.
Beware that Cash Journal transactions could be entering a positive or 
negative amount value. This is unusual when compared to other common 
types of old or other proprietary systems. Fortunately, both positive and 
negative amount values are legal with ADempiere.

Cash Payment Allocation
With the cash type invoice, the debit account is Petty Cash In-Transfer. We have 
not yet touched the Invoice (Vendor). It seems that we need to allocate a payment to 
the correct Invoice.
Yes, you are absolutely correct. Internally, ADempiere will automatically create an 
Allocation document. This document has a completed document status. We will 
access the cash payment allocation in the Menu | Open Items | View Allocation 
window. In the author's system, the allocation document has Cash Journal: Payment

Do not worry about the additional Intercompany Due From and 
Intercompany Due To accounting facts/GL journal entries. This happens 
because we have a transaction in multiple organizations. For your 
reference, do you remember that our cash book has been set up in the 
Dress organization, while our transaction (Material Receipt, Invoice 
(Vendor), and so on) took place in the Shirt organization? Anyway, with 
some configuration, we could avoid the Intercompany Due From and 
Intercompany Due To journal entries. We will discuss this in the Avoiding 
Intercompany Due From/To journal entries section of Chapter 7, Accounting 
Information and Configuration.

Summary
In this chapter, we talked about how to perform procurement activities 
using ADempiere.
To know exactly what goes on behind the scenes related to the accounting 
facts/GL journal activities, we have performed manual document postings. Using 
this approach, in return, we have learned exactly what the accounting facts/GL 
journal entries generated are, and when these accounting facts are generated.
In our discussion in this chapter, prior to creating a Purchase Order document, we 
have seen that it's quite common to first create a Purchase Requisition document. 
There is an option provided to create the Purchase Requisition document 
automatically. We have seen that this task can be done by setting up a replenish 
configuration. We have also seen how to set up the replenish configuration.
We have learned that one of the replenish configuration's requirement is the 
availability to set a default price list. With all of this information, we have then 
created our first requisition document by running the replenish report. Based 
on the replenish document, we could then generate a Purchase Order document.
Next, we performed a material receipt, vendor invoicing, and payment to our 
vendor, and reconciled this payment with our bank statement. These activities 
generated an accounting fact, and with this, we learned about exactly how and 
when an accounting fact occurs.
With all of the available raw material, in the next chapter, we will see how to handle 
all of the charges related to material procurement, how to manufacture a shirt, and 
then perform a sales activity. With this sales activity, we shall receive a payment or 
receipt from your customer, and we will then introduce you to the process of how 
to reconcile this receipt's transaction.


Landed Costs, Production, 
and Sales Activities
Procurement activities and payment to vendor topics have been covered in the previous 
chapter. We also already know about the accounting facts or GL journal entries 
generated related to those activities.
In this chapter, we will discuss how to handle all of the charges related to raw 
material procurement in the Landed cost section. With the availability of material 
in-house, we can manufacture our goods, and sell these finished goods to 
our customers.
In this chapter, we will discuss and practice the following:
Landed cost
Manufacturing finished goods—shirts
Quotations
Sales orders
Dispatching finished goods to customers
Receiving payment from customers
Reconciling the bank statement with regard to customer payment
Handling direct sales
We will activate the accounting processor, and explain the accounting facts/GL 
journal entries generated, wherever applicable.

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 172 ]
Activating the accounting processor
Previously, we worked with the accounting processor in a disabled state. In this 
condition, we had to post the documents one-by-one, manually. Ideally, the posting 
of documents should be done behind the scenes, and it is not a laborious task. From 
this chapter onwards, we will enable the accounting processor and watch the impact 
of the activated accounting processor.
To enable and activate accounting processors, use the following procedure:
1.	 Log in with user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role. 
and * as the Organization.
2.	 Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Server | Accounting 
Processor window. By default, it will contain one record.
3.	 Click on the Grid Toggle button, to show detailed information.
4.	 Select the Active checkbox.
5.	 Set Frequency Type to Minute.
6.	 Set Frequency to 1.
These conditions instruct the ADempiere server to process the unposted documents 
every minute.
You can alter the Frequency Type and Frequency information according 
to the needs of your ADempiere implementation.
Log out from the ADempiere client, and then stop (by executing C:\Adempiere\
utils\RUN_Server2Stop.bat) and restart (by executing C:\Adempiere\utils\RUN_
Server2.bat) your ADempiere server.
Landed costs
We have to import material, and it's quite common that we need some help from 
the transportation company to pick our material up from the airport or seaport 
and send this material to our company's warehouses. For this type of service, the 
transportation company will raise an invoice document to get the payment.
There are many types of expenses that are incurred when handling raw material 
procurement. For example:
Transportation charges
Clearance charges
Custom duties
Handling charges, and so on
•
•
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 173 ]
It would be better if ADempiere was able to handle these types of charges and apply 
these costs or charges directly to the raw material. With all of charges assigned to the 
raw material, we will know exactly how much to spend to acquire this material.
In the procurement context, landed cost is the total cost of goods including purchase 
price and all types of charges that may be incurred in delivering the ordered material 
to the company's warehouses.
The question is: how to map and book these type of charges into ADempiere?
It will be amazing if we can extend these types of costs (transportation or any other 
type of cost related to material procurement) directly to our material. With our 
current system, we just need to allocate and set these costs to an expenses type 
of account.
Yes, ADempiere has a mechanism to book these charges to the material. With 
this mechanism, we can and will distribute the total expenses raised during the 
procurement and/or receipt of materials directly to our material.
We will now practice how to implement the transportation charges and examine 
its impact on the valuation of our material. For this, we need to set up some 
additional information. 
Prerequisite configuration
We need to set up some additional information to prepare for the landed cost 
example transaction. Log in with user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd 
Admin as the role, and * as the organization.
Entering an additional business partner
As we have not yet registered the transportation company as our business partner, 
we will enter the relevant information in the Menu | Partner Relations | Business 
Partner Rules | Business Partner window. Open this window, and then set and save 
the following information:

After completing the fields mentioned in the previous table, perform the 
following steps:
1.	 Go to the Vendor tab, and select the Vendor checkbox.
2.	 Go to the Location tab, click on the New button, and then click on the button 
inside the Address field. Enter Semarang in the City field, set the Country 
field to Indonesia, and then click on the OK button.
3.	 Go to the Contact (User) tab, and set Andrea in the Name field.
Next, we will need to prepare a new account combination.
Creating a new account combination
When working on the transportation charges, we can utilize the 73300 – Shipping 
Expenses account from the chart of accounts. Moreover, for future reference, we will 
create an account combination using the 14120 – Product Asset account.
Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Account 
Combination window, set and save the following information:

Setting transportation charges
We need a special Charge record to book our transportation charges. Open the 
Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Charge window, click on 
the New button in the Charge tab, and set the following information:
1.	 Enter * in the Organization field.
2.	 Enter Transportation in the Name field.
3.	 Click on the Save button. Go to the Accounting tab, and change the 
default Charge Expense and Charge Revenue to the Shirt-73300 
account combination, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 175 ]
Is there a way to create a Charge through a more compact solution?
As an alternative, you can use the Generate Charges window to create a Charge. 
There is no need to create a new accounting combination and to manually set up 
both the charge expense and revenue in the Charge window.
To create new charges, open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules 
| Generate Charges window. This window contains a list of accounts that have 
revenue and expense account types, and that can be used to create a new Charge.
For example, you can create the 73300 – Shipping Expenses charge as follows:
1.	 Select the Select checkbox in the 73300 account.
2.	 Click on the Create From Account button.
3.	 You will be prompted with the Charge created confirmation window that 
indicates a successful Charge creation.

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 176 ]
Check your Charge window, and you will find that a new Shipping Expenses 
charge is now available.
Setting a new cost element
The purpose of a cost element is to capture, retrieve, and display different categories 
of cost, such as material, overhead, burden, and freight cost types; 
in a single product costing model.
To distribute transportation costs (or other eligible costs) to the material, we will 
create a new cost element. Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Costing 
| Cost Element window. Click on the New button, and complete the following 
information fields:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Freight.
3.	 Set the Description field to Additional material cost element as an example 
of landed cost implementation.
4.	 Set the Cost Element Type field to Material (select from the given options).
5.	 Set the Costing Method field blank, and then click on the Save button.
We will continue our configuration by altering the product's cost adjustment 
default account.
Altering the product cost adjustment default 
account
If we post the future Transaction Charge transactions through the Invoice (Vendor) 
window by using the AP Invoice document type, it will generally produce 
accounting facts/GL journal entries in the format shown in the following table:
Window

In the current configuration, the product Cost Adjustment default account is set 
to the *-51210-_-_-_-_-_ account combination. For your reference, open the Menu | 
Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product window. Navigate 
to the S Fabric records, click on the Accounting tab, and find the Cost Adjustment 
field information.

Chapter 6
[ 177 ]
Earlier, you told us that we can allocate our landed costs to raw materials directly. 
But depending on the accounting facts/GL journal entries generated when booking 
the transportation costs, it seems that we also need to alter our cost adjustment 
default account configuration from *-51210-_-_-_-_-_ to the Product Asset 
account. Do I need to alter this configuration?
You are definitely right. We will have to alter the Cost Adjustment default 
account to our newly-created Shirt-14120-_-_-_-_-_ account combination. Apply 
this configuration to the S Fabric, S Thread, S Button, and S Label products. Refer 
to Chapter 4, Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration, for the 
procedure to alter the account combination. 
The following screenshot shows the new Cost Adjustment configuration for the 
S Fabric products, listed in the Accounting tab of the Product window:
Creating additional Price Lists
As the Currency field has a read-only status, you will notice that you cannot create 
a new AP Invoice document in the Invoice (Vendor) window with other than in 
USD currency.
The currency that is used when creating the AP Invoice document will be taken from 
the Price List configuration. Due to the unavailability of the IDR price list, we need to 
create a price list that uses IDR currency.
Log out from system and login again using user ID admin. Instead of using * as 
organization, set Shirt as your organization and 1st Shirt W/h as your warehouse. 
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Price List 
window. In the Price List tab, set the following field information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to IDR Purchase PL.
3.	 Set the Currency field to IDR.

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 178 ]
After saving this information, go to the Version tab, and set the following 
field information:
1.	 Set the Name field to IDR Purchase PL version.
2.	 Set the Price List Schema field to Standard.
With this existing IDR price list, we can now enter our transportation charges.
Registering for the transportation charges
For the services provided by the transportation company, they will supply us with 
invoice document. Based on this document, we can proceed with our payment. We 
will book this invoice through the Invoice (Vendor) window.
Before we proceed with this invoice, we have to know exactly how to 
allocate this cost to the material. Imagine that we receive an invoice 
document consisting of bills for two or more deliveries. Examine what 
currency they used with this invoice. As the transportation will happen 
internally within your country, the local currency will be used when 
issuing the invoice. In our case, we can set it to the IDR currency (recall 
that our accounting schema used USD currency).
We will assume that we received an invoice from Maersk Logistic worth 
IDR 2,000,000 for their service to transport material to our company warehouses.
Cost distribution type
This transportation cost will be distributed to our material. Maersk Logistic provided 
the following details of the goods:
Raw Material
Qty
Value/Cost (US$)
S Fabric
100 meters
380
S Thread
50 Cone
80
S Button
200 Pieces
16
S Label
1000 Pieces
80
With this data, we can distribute the cost based on Qty or Cost. The most applicable 
method for such data is distribution based on Cost.

Chapter 6
[ 179 ]
The following is a complete list of the cost distribution types available:
Cost: It is calculated on the invoice value of our material receipt. If you do 
not have an AP Invoice document for your material receipt then you can 
NOT proceed further.
Line: It is calculated on the total number of lines.
Quantity: It is calculated on the receipt quantity.
Volume: It is calculated on the receipt quantity multiplied by its volume.
Weight: It is based on receipt quantity multiplied by its weight.
You can define a product's volume or weight in the Menu | 
Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product 
window. Go to the Product tab and find Volume and/or Weight 
fields there.
Choosing a distribution type from this list of cost distribution types is your decision. 
Thus, ADempiere provides us with this feature of defining the distribution type in a 
logical way.
Expected distribution value
We will practice distributing our transportation cost based on the Cost distribution 
type. In the end, we will get the distribution values shown in the following table:
Raw

3.	 In the Business Partner Info window, click on the Cancel button.
4.	 You will be directed back to the Shipment Info window. Press F5 (or click on 
the ReQuery button) to show the available material receipt documents, and 
select one from the list.

Chapter 6
[ 181 ]
After clicking on the Receipt field in the search list, we will be prompted 
by the Shipment Info window. Note that the field is labeled Receipt, but 
the search window that it opens is titled Shipment. The reality is this is a 
material movement search window. The Sales Transaction flag indicates 
the difference between a Shipment (a sales related transaction) and a 
Receipt (a purchase related transaction).
After entering four of our landed costs data, you can choose one of these data, click 
on the Grid Toggle button to check out the detail view of records, and then click on 
the Distribute Costs button. With the completion of these tasks, ADempiere will 
calculate and distribute the costs to the registered material receipt document.
You can find the distribution values by accessing the Landed Cost Allocation tab. 
Refer to the following screenshot for the allocation values generated:
You have already entered the invoice document. Now, go back to the Invoice tab,

As far as I know, this is a multi-currency transaction. This means that we created 
an Invoice in the IDR currency, while our accounting schema currency is USD. 
How can we access the transaction currency (IDR) and its USD conversion value 
from this transportation charges transaction?
Good question. Click on the Enter Query tab in the Account Viewer window. This 
tab contains two areas: Selection and Display. In the Display section, select the 
Display Source Info checkbox, and click on the ReQuery button (the button at the 
bottom right-hand side of the Account Viewer window), and you will see the 
information shown in the following screenshot:
As shown in the previous screenshot, the debit transaction is set up to use the 
14120 – Product Asset account instead of the standard 51210 – Product Cost 
Adjustment account.
Manufacturing finished goods—shirts
We are now ready to manufacture shirts. The prerequisites to manufacture shirts are:
Setting up a Bill of Material. This is to define the raw material composition 
used to produce the final product.
Creating a Production.
With this version of ADempiere, the manufacturing process will be a simple task. 
It requires the Bill of Material configuration only. We will practice manufacturing 
ten shirts.

Chapter 6
[ 183 ]
Bill of material (BOM)
Consider the real life situation where you need to buy a lot of food products to fulfill 
the necessities of life. This could include bread, milk, fruits, snacks, vegetables, and 
so on. Closely observe what's written the milk carton. The carton contains a list of its 
ingredients. Manufacturers share the information of the composition of milk with 
the customers.
In our discussion, bill of material is the term used to describe the specification of 
the raw materials and quantities needed to manufacture a product. In this case, the 
creation of shirts requires at least four common raw materials: fabric, thread, buttons, 
and labels.
The following is the required raw material composition to manufacture a shirt:
Raw Material
Composition
S Fabric
1.89 (meter)
S Thread
0.4 (cone)
S Button
6 (pieces)
S Label
1 (pieces)
Entering the bill of material information
I was browsing for the Bill of Material window, and it seems that it does not exist. 
How do I configure the Bill of Material?
ADempiere 3.4.2s version does not provide a Bill of Material window. You will find 
the bill of material in the Product window, on the Bill of Materials tab. We will set 
up the bill of material for the finished goods product—Shirt Finished Goods.
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product 
window. Look for the Shirt Finished Goods records. To set up a bill of material for 
this product, you have to do the following:
1.	 Select the Bill of Materials checkbox in the Product tab for your product 
(Shirt Finished Goods).

3.	 Go back to the Product tab, and click on the Verify BOM button. This 
procedure will check that the BOM products entries do not have a circular 
reference to Shirt Finished Goods or to other BOM products. Ensure 
that you get the OK message in the status bar.
Expense type of product as a part of bill 
of material
In order to manufacture a product, besides the raw material, we also need to set a 
fixed value to represent how much overhead cost (including labor, electricity type of 
cost, and so on) is allocated to manufacture a single unit of the product. How do I 
manage this cost allocation for the products?
In ADempiere, we need to define special products that are indicated as overhead cost 
products. As we need to set a fixed overhead cost, we can use the Standard Costing 
costing model for these types of products.
To fulfill this requirement, we need to perform the following tasks:
Create a new product and product category
Set a standard cost for the product
Alter the new product's Product Asset default account
In the next section, we will learn how to set up a new product category.
Creating an overhead product category
We need to create a new product category and set up Standard Costing as its costing 
method. Open the Product Category window, and then set and save the following 
information in the Product Category tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to Overhead.
•

Chapter 6
[ 185 ]
Navigate to the Accounting tab, and set the following information:
1.	 Set the Costing Method field to Standard Costing.
2.	 Set the Costing Level field to Client.
With this accounting configuration, the standard cost will now be applicable to 
the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd client (including all of the registered organizations 
in this client).
You can define separate standard cost values for your products in 
each of the available organizations by defining Costing Level field to 
Organization in the Accounting tab 
Creating labor and electricity products
After defining a product category, we need to create the labor and electricity products, 
which have a standard or fixed cost when manufacturing the Shirt Finished 
Goods. Open the Product window, navigate to the Product tab, and then set and 
save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to Labor & Electricity.
3.	 Set the Product Category field to Overhead.
4.	 Set the UOM field to Piece.
5.	 Set the Product Type field to Expense type.
6.	 Deselect the Purchase and Sold checkboxes.
Next, we need to alter the Product Asset and Product Expense default accounts.
Altering the product's default account
When manufacturing the finished goods, we need to reserve this labor and electricity 
type of cost, but not book this cost into the expense type of account directly. In this 
approach, we need to book this overhead cost into a balance account. At the end of 
the accounting periods (monthly), the accounts department should take care of the 
reversal of an outstanding balance in the balance account and book the real labor and 
electricity costs to the correct expenses account type.

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 186 ]
In the chart of accounts, we can use 15190 – Prepaid Others account as our balance 
account. We will alter the Product Asset and Product Expense default accounts of the 
Labor & Electricity product to the 15190 – Prepaid Others account by performing 
the following steps:
1.	 Create a new Shirt-15190-_-_-_-_-_ account combination.
2.	 Change both the Product Asset and Product Expense default accounts to the 
Shirt-15190-_-_-_-_-_ account combination.
The following screenshot shows the Accounting tab configuration after performing 
the previous steps:
Setting up the product's standard cost
As per the accounting department policy, only after analyzing the trend of labor 
and electricity costs in the past six months will they allocate US$ 1.25 to each of the 
finished shirt products.
With this information, we can set a standard cost for the product cost by performing 
the following steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | Costing | Product 
Costs window.
2.	 On the Select Product tab, ensure that your active record is Labor & 
Electricity products.
3.	 Navigate to the Product Costs tab, and then set and save the 
following information:
Set the Organization field to *
Set the Accounting Schema field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd 
UN/34 US Dollar (select the option from the list; it has only 
one option)

Set the Cost Element field to Standard Costing
Set the Current Cost Price field to 1.25
This is shown in the following screenshot:
Note that we are not defining the currency information here. The currency 
information should be taken from the Accounting Schema currency.
If you set the Costing Level to Organization in the Accounting tab of 
Product Category window, then you can define each of the organization 
standard costs in this Product Costs tab. Instead of using *, you can set it 
to an appropriate organization. 
Registering labor and electricity products into 
the Shirt's BOM
After creating and configuring the labor and electricity products, we need to register 
these products as a part of the bill of material for Shirt Finished Goods.
Open the Product window, and ensure that you are working with the Shirt 
Finished Goods product. Navigate to the Bill of Materials tab, and set and 
save the following information:
1.	 Set the Line No field to 50.
2.	 Set the Description field to Capturing labor and electricity costs.

5.	 Set the BOM Quantity field to 1.
Navigate back to the Product tab, and click on the Verify BOM button again.
Production
Now that we have configured the bill of material, we will be able to manufacture our 
product by using the production feature of ADempiere.
Navigate to the Menu | Material Management | Production window. This window 
contains three tabs: Production Header, Production Plan, and Production Line. On 
the Production Header tab, set the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Name field to Manufacture Shirts FG.
3.	 Set the Movement Date field to the default date.
After saving this information, click on the Production Plan tab, and complete the 
following information fields:
1.	 Set the Product field to Shirt Finished Goods.
2.	 Set the Production Quantity field to 10.
3.	 Set the Locator field to Loc S1A (select from the available options).
Finally, click on the Save button. Navigate back to the Production Header tab. 
Examine the following screenshot:

Completion of the above activities will create a record on the Production Line tab. 
This tab will contain information on how much material is required to manufacture 
10 qty of Shirt Finished Goods.
Due to the updated records in the Production Line tab, the Records created 
checkbox will now have a selected status. Click on the Create/Post Production 
button once again to complete the production activity. ADempiere will prompt us 
with a Create/Post Production confirmation window, and all you need to do is click

Chapter 6
[ 191 ]
For a better understanding, can you explain the S Fabric list of cost in this table?
Manufacturing one garment (or a shirt in our case) will require (B) 1.89 meters of 
S Fabric. When we set the Average PO for this material's costing method, the cost 
calculation will be taken from the average purchase price value of these goods. As 
we made only one purchase at the time, the cost for these goods will be same as the 
purchase price value, that is, US$ 3.80 (A). The value for S Fabric consumption is 
US$ 7.182 (C)
To acquire S Fabric, we are charged for the transportation costs of four raw 
materials. We distribute this cost based on the Cost distribution method. From 
IDR 2,000,000, the distribution value pointed to S Fabric is IDR 1,366,906.4. As our 
accounting schema uses USD as the main currency, we divide this distribution value 
by the currency rate which is currently effective, which means that US$ 1 equals 
IDR 10,000. Finally, the total distribution cost for S Fabric is USD 136.6906 (D).
The transportation cost is for the total quantity of S Fabric. We will distribute it to a 
per UOM cost basis. Divide it by 100 (E) and the result is US$ 1.3669 (F). As 1 shirt 
consumes 1.89 meter, the S Fabric transportation cost allocated is US$ 2.5835 (G).
We get US$ 9.7655 (H) as a combination cost for S Fabric in order to manufacture 
1 shirt. If we manufacture 10 shirts, the total cost is US$ 97.65 (I)
Proposal or Quotation document
With the completion of stock activities, we now have ten finished shirts and we are 
ready to create sales. In business, it is quiet common to create an offer letter for our 
customers. Through this offer letter, we inform our customers about our products, 
specifications (if applicable), and price information.
Introduction to Proposal and Quotation
In general, we can prepare an offer letter and create this document as a Proposal or 
Quotation document. These types are described as follows:
A Proposal aims to create an offer without binding the customer. It just 
provides information. Without binding the customer, the stock quantity 
of our products is not reserved, and we are free to offer our product to 
other customers.
A Quotation aims to create an offer letter that binds the customer. In this 
type of document, our stock will be reserved for the customers who are 
offered the letter.
•

Assume that we have four free products to offer after, the first quotation. When 
creating the next quotation document which requires five products, ADempiere 
will give us a warning, such as Insufficient Inventory Available.
In the default ADempiere installation, the Insufficient Inventory 
Available warning is just a warning, and we can still proceed with 
this document.
Setting up a product's sales price
In Chapter 4, Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration, we 
saw that the price of raw material is given in the Menu | Material Management 
| Material Management Rules | Product window, and we can get the price 
information from the Price tab.
After determining the raw material costs, we need to set a price for our Shirt 
Finished Goods product.
Before creating a proposal or quotation document, follow this procedure to set up 
the price for our finished goods. Navigate to the Product tab, and ensure that your 
active record is Shirt Finished Goods. Then, navigate to the Price tab, and save the 
following information fields:
1.	 Set the Price List Version field to Sales PL March Version.
2.	 Set the List Price, Standard Price, and Limit Price fields to 20.
The Sales PL March version is a version instance of the Sales PL 
price list.

Chapter 6
[ 193 ]
If you enter products that do not have price list information, or that use a price list 
other than the price list configured for these products, then you will get an error 
message, as shown in the following screenshot, when saving your Proposal or 
Quotation line document:
Entering a Proposal or Quotation document
I tried to find a Proposal or Quotation window, but had no luck. How do I proceed 
with the Proposal or Quotation documents?
Unfortunately, there are no Proposal or Quotation windows available. But in 
ADempiere, we can create both of these documents by using Binding offer and Non 
binding offer document types from the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Orders | 
Sales Order window.
This window will provide you with three tabs: Order, Order Line, and Order Tax. In 
the Order tab, you will find a Target Document Type field, which contains a list of 
document types applicable to the Sales Order window. The following is a complete

Proposal conversion to a Standard Order
You can create a new Sales Order by using the Standard Order document type 
to fulfill customer orders. Set the PO Line information with the same information 
mentioned in the proposal document. To make it easy, ADempiere has a predefined 
feature to convert previous proposal documents into Standard Order document types.
The Proposal, or Non-binding offer, document needs to be in the 
In Progress status in order to be converted.
You can convert your Proposal, or Non-binding offer, document as follows:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Orders | Quote convert 
process.
2.	 When you click on this ADempiere process, you will be prompted with a 
Convert open Proposal or Quotation to Order confirmation window.
3.	 In this window, you can set the following information:
Set the Order field to your proposal document number.
Set the Document Type field to the targeted document type. 
Here, we will use Standard Order.
Set the Document Date field to the desired date (if necessary).
Select the Close Document checkbox. If you select this 
checkbox, then all the documents mentioned in the Order field 
will be closed (in this case, the Non-binding offer document).
4.	 Finalize the order by clicking on the Start button.
ADempiere has now created a new Sales Order document that has Standard Order 
as the Target Document Type. It will copy the proposal information to the newly 
created document.
Examining the resulting standard order 
document
Navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Orders | Sales Order window 
to find your newly converted standard order document. This new document has 
Drafted as the Document Status. Go through both the Order and Order Line tabs, 
and examine the document itself. If required, you can make any changes at this 
document status level.

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 198 ]
Shipments
In the previous activities, we have reserved our finished goods, and now we need 
to prepare shipment documents based on the Sales Order document type that we 
created. There are a three ways to create this document. They are as follows:
Manual: By entering the data yourself in the Shipment (Customer) window
Semi automatic: By using the Generate Shipments (manual) window
Automatic: Generated when executing the Generate Shipments process
Generating Shipments
What is the best way to generate and process the shipment documents?
There are no strict rules for generating a shipment document. We can choose any one 
of the available options. Usually, it is a good idea to use the Generate Shipments 
process, as this is the most efficient of the options. The other two options can only be 
used if the volume of transactions is low. We can generate shipments as follows:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Shipments | Generate 
Shipments process window.
2.	 We will process the shipments by setting the fields as follows:
Set the Warehouse field to 1st Shirt W/h
Set the Shipment Date field to the required target date, or leave 
it blank for the current default date
Set the Business Partner field to Liz Claiborne Inc
Set the Document Action field to Prepare
Do not select Complete at this stage, as we might need to alter some 
of the information in the generated shipment document, later.
You are free to select or deselect the Consolidate to one Document checkbox. 
Selecting this checkbox means that if there are several standard orders for a business 
partner that have the same location and same delivery rule, these orders will be 
consolidated to a single shipment.

Refer to the following screenshot:
Click on the Start button, and in the upcoming Print Shipments confirmation 
window, click on the OK button. Examine the delivery report produced. Thus, you 
will get a successfully-generated shipment document, along with log information.
Shipment (Customer)
You can access your generated shipment document now. Open the 
Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Shipments | Shipment (Customer) window. 
You will notice that your shipment document has an In Progress status in the 
Document Status field.
As an ADempiere standard, when using the Generate Shipments process, the 
document created in the Shipment (Customer) window will use the MM Shipment 
as its document type. There are several document types that can be used in this 
window. They are as follows:
MM Shipment
MM Shipment Indirect
MM Vendor Return
•
•
•

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 200 ]
The MM Shipment Indirect is almost the same as MM Shipment. The difference 
between these two document types is that the MM Shipment Indirect will be used 
when using POS Order as its Sales Order document type. The MM Vendor Return 
document type will be used when a customer wants to return the materials. 
Shipment confirmation
In our company, we have a different section to handle the shipment activities. The 
documentation tasks are handled by the Shipping personnel. They do not physically 
touch the goods that need to be shipped. The goods are handled by our Warehouse 
persons. In this case, the Shipping personnel need to be convinced that their 
document matches the finished goods that the company is sending out. 
How do we do that?
Communication between two departments can be done by using the confirmation 
feature of ADempiere.
Imagine that the Shipping personnel (Bob) and the Warehouse personnel (Steve) 
have the following conversation:
Hi Steve, we have prepared the commercial document to deliver shirts to 
our customer Liz. Can you crosscheck this document with its shipping 
confirmation document?
Prior to the conversation with Steve, Bob opens the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | 
Shipments | Shipment (Customer) window, navigates to the Shipment tab, and 
finds out the records that have an In Progress status. He then clicks on the Create 
Confirmation button. In the Create Confirmation window, he sets Ship/Receipt 
Confirm as the Confirmation Type, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the OK button. Upon successful creation confirmation, you will see a 
number in the status bar (on the bottom left-hand side of the Shipment (Customer) 
window). This number is the Ship/Receipt Confirm document number.

Chapter 6
[ 201 ]
ADempiere will now generate a Ship/Receipt Confirm document, and Bob can see 
this information in the Confirmations tab of the Shipment (Customer) document. 
As this document needs a confirmation from the warehouse personnel, at this 
stage, Bob cannot complete the MM Shipment document. Trying to complete 
this document will generate a warning message such as Open Ship/Receipt 
Confirmation: Ship/Receipt Confirm – document number in the status bar.
Okay, now we will play the role of the warehouse person, Steve. He periodically 
checks the Menu | Material Management | Ship/Receipt Confirm window. 
This window contains two tabs: Confirmation and Line tabs. Steve examines the 
incoming information in this window, physically examines the finished goods, 
that is, shirts, and thus completes the document.
"Bob, we have confirmed the Ship/Receipt document. You can now check the 
document and continue with your tasks", says Steve.
Bob will now complete the MM Shipment document by clicking on the Complete 
button in the Shipment (Customer) window.
Updating the Shirt Finished Goods standard cost
Do you remember what costing method we used for the Shirt Finished Goods 
product? Revisit the Product Category accounting configuration section from Chapter 4, 
Setting up Master Data and Knowing its Accounting Configuration, and you will find that 
our Shirt Finished Goods use the Standard Costing costing method.
In this costing method, we have to define a standard cost for these products. As 
usual, you can define a product's standard cost in the Product Costs window. We 
can define its standard cost by calculating the product's total cost incurred when 
manufacturing the product. This includes the cost of raw materials, freight, labor, 
and electricity in our case.
In addition to manually updating the standard cost information, we can transfer 
the total cost of the products into Shirt Finished Goods by performing the 
following activities:
Create Costing Records
Update Standard Cost
•
•

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 202 ]
First execute the Menu | Performance Analysis | Costing | Create Costing Records 
process. In the upcoming confirmation window, set the Product field to Shirt 
Finished Goods, and then click on the Start button. After performing this activity, 
you can access these records from the Product Costs tab of the Product Costs 
window of the Shirt Finished Goods product, as shown in the following screenshot:
Next, execute the Menu | Performance Analysis | Costing | Standard Cost Update 
processes to update product's standard costs, and set the following information in 
the upcoming confirmation window:
1.	 Set the Product Category field to Finished Goods.
2.	 Standard Cost field to Average PO.
Click on the Start button. This will transfer the Average PO cost price into the 
Standard Costing cost price. 
Accounting facts
Wait for a moment, and then press F5 repeatedly, until you get a Posted status for

What is COGS?
COGS stands for Cost of Goods Sold. In accounting, COGS is the total direct 
expense incurred during the production of a product. COGS includes the cost 
of materials used to make these goods or products and the cost of labor to 
manufacture them. 
The following is an example of the accounting fact/GL journal entry generated by 
our previous transaction:
As expected, the 126.47 is calculated as: product's standard costs multiplied by 
shipment quantity.
Generating customer invoices
During shipment, to obtain payment, we raise an invoice document to our customer. 
ADempiere provides us with the following three methods for raising an invoice:
Generate Invoices (manual): Although this is named as manual, it is actually 
semi-automatic invoice generation.
Generate Invoices: We can issue an invoice with the Prepare status in 
Document Action.
Invoice (Customer): We can manually issue an invoice through this window.
Generating invoices using Generate Invoices 
(manual)
This procedure is almost the same as the one for shipments. For the sake of variety, 
we will use Generate Invoice (manual) for practice. Navigate to the Menu | 
Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Invoices | Generate Invoices (manual) window. 
Set the following information fields:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Document Type field to Order.

This will show a list of eligible order documents. Select the checkbox to the left of the

Click on OK, and in the next Print Invoices confirmation window, and then click on 
the OK button again. Finally, you will get a successfully-generated invoice document 
with log information. Thus, we will now have an invoice that has a Complete status 
as its Document Status.
You can also use the Generate Invoices process. In this case, the 
resulting status of the invoice will be In Progress. This status means that 
you will be able to alter any information inside the invoice document.
Examining the Invoice (Customer) window
Navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Invoices | Invoice (Customer) 
window. You will find the generated invoice. After getting the Complete status for 
the document, take a print of the document.
Thus, we have generated an invoice using AR Invoice as its document type. The 
following are the document types that can be used in this window:
AR Credit Memo
AR Invoice
AR Invoice Indirect
•
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 205 ]
The AR Invoice Indirect is almost the same as the AR Invoice. The difference 
between these document types is that the AR Invoice Indirect will be used when 
POS Order is used as its Sales Order document type. We will create an invoice 
using the AR Credit Memo document type, only if our customer returns a product 
or material.
The other important aspects that need your attention are the Payment Rule and 
Payment Term used in the invoice. The generated invoice uses On Credit as its 
Payment Rule, and Immediate as its Payment Term. The information on both is 
taken from the Sales Order document. 
Although the status of the invoice is Complete, we can still alter the 
Payment Rule and Payment Term conditions.
For your reference, check out the Payment Term and the Payment Rule for the 
generated sample invoice, in the following screenshot:

The following screenshot shows the accounting fact generated:
As you can see in the above screenshot, accounts 11110 and 11130 belong to the Asset 
type of account. The total value for the Asset transaction is zero (nothing).
Although these accounting facts are not reflected in our bank accounts 
and account receivable entries yet, they are worth noting down.
Payment allocation
Payment from Liz has not been reflected in the Account Receivable entry yet. How 
do we allocate this payment to the related account receivable entry?
We can perform payment allocation to the related invoice as follows:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | Open Items | Payment Allocation window.
2.	 Set the following information fields:
Set the Business Partner field to Liz Claiborne Inc
Set the Currency field to USD
After entering the business partner information, press the Tab key to 
move out of the Business Partner field, the system will generate an 
information in both the Payment grid and the Invoice grid automatically.
3.	 Ensure that you select the Select checkbox in a proper Account Receivable 
payment records available in the Payment grid record.
4.	 Allocate the payment to the Invoice. With the available invoice records in 
the Invoice grid, select the proper invoice by selecting the Select checkbox, 
in order to allocate the account receivable payment document to the selected 
invoice document.
5.	 Click on the Process button.

Based on the payment allocation, ADempiere internally creates records in the 
View Allocation window. Navigate to the Menu | Open Items | View Allocation 
window to find your records. You will find some information on the Allocation tab.
The most important information is present in the Allocation Line tab. This tab 
contains information regarding the relationship among Sales Order, Invoice 
(Customer), and Payment. Refer to the following screenshot for details:

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 210 ]
So why bother ourselves with all of these allocation complexities?
Well, this affords us great flexibility: many invoices for one order (which may 
come from partial shipments); many orders in one consolidated invoice (in case 
we deliver orders to one customer throughout the month and we send a single 
invoice at the end of the month); many payments for one invoice; and one payment 
for many invoices. The complex allocation is able to manage these many-to-many 
relationships!

Void and Reset allocation
With increasing payments and invoices, it is possible that the accounting person 
performs a wrong allocation. For instance, the account receivable payment is 
allocated to the wrong invoices. How do we manage this situation?
Yes, this is a common situation where hundreds of account receivable payment 
records are present. To revise or reset a previous payment allocation, ADempiere 
has features called Reset Allocation and Void allocation.

Chapter 6
[ 211 ]
Reset allocation
Access this feature by navigating to the Menu | Open Items | Reset Allocation 
window. Although you can proceed with blank information in the selection criteria 
(which means resetting all of the documents), it is suggested that you enter your 
related business partner information and specify the target allocation document 
that needs to be removed, as shown in the following screenshot:
After performing these tasks, you can navigate back to the Payment Allocation 
window, and continue with your transaction.
Due to these activities, the related View Allocation document and the 
accounting facts/GL journal entry will be deleted.
Void allocation
The second method is to void the allocation. You can void the allocation document 
as follows:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | Open Items | View Allocation window, and find 
your target allocation document.
2.	 Now that you have selected the allocation data, click on the Close button.

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 212 ]
3.	 You will be prompted with the Document Action window. Select Void from 
the list in the Document Action field, and click on the OK button. A sample 
Document Action window is shown in the following screenshot:
On completion, the selected view allocation data will have a Voided document 
status, and the accounting facts/GL journal entry will have been removed. You 
can continue with setting of correct payment allocation.
In the Void Allocation method, we will have a Voided document that 
can still be used for document tracking, whereas in the Reset Allocation 
we will have nothing.
Bank statement
We need to reconcile this payment with our bank transaction. Like in the previous 
procurement bank statement activity, we will get the copies of our bank statement 
from the bank officer or from the online banking facilities. The procedure for this 
bank statement activity is similar to the previous procurement bank statement activity.
Navigate to the Menu | Open Items | Bank Statement window. Complete the fields 
in the Bank Statement tab with the new data, and set the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Bank Account field to USD-1-001-888888.
3.	 Set the Name field to Third Bank Statement.
4.	 Set the Statement date field to your working date.
5.	 Set the Beginning Balance field to 520.
After saving this information, navigate to the Statement Line tab, and set the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Statement Line Date, Account Date, and Effective date fields to 
10/08/2009 (this date is subjective).
2.	 Set the Statement amount field to 200.

Chapter 6
[ 213 ]
We need to reconcile the Statement amount value with our ADempiere transaction. 
This is done in the following way:
1.	 Select the payment data by clicking on the Payment field.
2.	 In the upcoming Payment Info confirmation window, ensure that the 
Receipt checkbox is selected.
3.	 Click on the ReQuery button, in order to view the available account 
receivable payment list.
4.	 Select the appropriate record, and then click on the OK button.
5.	 If you wish, you can set up the Reference No and or Memo fields as well.
Remember that this is only a simulation for a single bank statement. 
The actual company transaction will contain data from hundreds of 
bank statements that need to be reconciled.

Managing direct sales
Our company wants to have a store that can be used for direct selling, so that, 
anybody can come to our store, look for a product, and buy the required products. 
How do we manage these types of sales?
Yes, ADempiere can handle direct sales activities. In a supermarket, you must 
have noticed customers who want to buy some products go to the cashier and set 
a payment. No proposal or quotation is involved. Although you can create direct 
sales using modes of payment other than cash a (credit card, for example), here 
we will practice direct sales using only cash as the payment rule.
Preparing cash books
In order to use cash as a payment method or rule, we need to prepare and set up 
ADempiere cash books. All of the cash transactions should be transferred directly 
to these cash books. Currently, we have two default cash books in the system: USD 
Cash book and IDR Cash book. Take a detailed look at both of these cash books. 
They use Dress as their Organization information.

Chapter 6
[ 215 ]
When you perform a point of sales activity in the Shirt organization, 
it will be mandatory to use a cash book that belongs to the Shirt 
organization only.
To comply with this requirement, we need to create a USD Point of Sales cash book. 
Navigate to the Menu | System Admin | Organization Rules | Cashbook window, 
and then complete and save the following information fields in the Cashbook tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Name field to USD Point of Sales Cash Book.
3.	 Set the Currency field to USD.
The cash book is now ready for use, and we can proceed with creating the sales 
order document.
Entering a sales order
There is no special window to book a direct sales transaction. You can simply 
navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Orders | Sales Order window. 
Instead of using the Standard Order document type, we can specify POS Order 
as the document type for direct sales activities.
Assuming that we do not have enough stock of Shirt Finished Goods, you need to 
manufacture one Shirt Finished Goods product through the Production window 
(refer to the Production section of Chapter 6, Landed Cost, Production, and Sales 
Activities, for details of how to manufacture a product). Navigate to the Sales 
Order window, and complete the following information fields in the Order tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Target Document Type field to POS Order.
3.	 Set the Business Partner field to Standard. Here, you can create your own 
business partner. Generally, we define this type of customer as a walk in 
customer (a special business partner) and use this business partner when 
handling the direct sales activities.
4.	 Set the Warehouse field to 1st Shirt W/h. In general, you need to create a 
special warehouse that indicates your store.
5.	 Set the Price List field to Sales PL. This price list uses USD as its currency.
As a sales transaction standard, the POS Order document type uses Cash as its 
default payment rule. Examine the button below the Price List field information.

Landed Costs, Production, and Sales Activities
[ 216 ]
Assuming that the walk in customer buys one shirt, you can enter the following 
information on the Order Line tab:
1.	 Set the Product field to Shirt Finished Goods.
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 1.
Navigate back to the Order tab to complete this document.
Unveiling POS Order transaction workflow
After completing this document, you will see a message at the bottom left-hand side 
of the window (status bar), as shown in the following screenshot:
When completing a POS Order document, ADempiere automatically creates an 
extra document behind the scenes. The explanation for the messages in the above 
screenshot is that the system will create the following documents:
An MM Shipment Indirect document in the Shipment (Customer) window. 
In this example, this document has 550000 as its document number.
An AR Invoice Indirect document in the Invoice (Customer) window. In 
this example, this document has 150000 as its document number.
Cash Journal entries in the Menu | Open Items | Cash Journal window. In 
the Cash Line tab, the contained transaction uses Invoice as its Cash Type, 
and has positive values.
You can examine both of the documents in their respective windows.
Accounting facts
There is no difference between the accounting facts/GL journal entries generated 
in the shipping and the invoice document. The MM Shipment Indirect document 
generates accounting facts just like the MM Shipment document does, and the AR 
Invoice Indirect document generates accounting facts just like the AR Invoice does.
When entering the transaction in the Cash Journal by using Invoice as its Cash Type 
and having a positive value, the accounting facts/GL journal entry format should be

by our sample transaction:
Summary
In this chapter, you have learned more about the sample business process cycle.
We started our discussion by looking at how to book charges that are incurred 
during procurement activities. To accomplish this task, we learned how to create a 
new instance of a cost element, saw an example of how to distribute these expenses 
by using the available cost distribution types, and also learned the distribution of 
expenses in detail.
We continued our discussion by looking at how to manufacture a product in this 
version of ADempiere by using the bill of material feature, involving both item 
and expenses type of products. After manufacturing the products, we created an 
offer letter for the customers. On receiving their confirmation, we raised a sales 
order document, delivered the product to the customer, and finally invoiced them. 
After performing these activities, we learned how to manage the payment (account 
receivable payment) and reconcile the transaction with our bank statement.
Towards the end of this chapter, we learned how ADempiere manages direct 
sales—a type of sales transaction. In this type of transaction, ADempiere 
generates both shipment and invoice documents behind the scenes.
In the next chapter, we will take a look at the accounting configuration parts 
of ADempiere. We will learn how to define our own account, what an accounting 
dimension is, and will discuss the Accounting Schema. You will also be introduced 
to a sample implementation for Commitment accounting and General 
Ledger distribution.


Accounting Information 
and Configuration
The heart of ADempiere ERP is accounting. The power behind its accounting engine 
is its accounting configuration. There are some areas that need your attention. They 
are the areas in which accounting configuration drives the accounting behavior when 
implementing the ADempiere system. Moreover, once you are familiar with the 
flexibility of the accounting configuration, you can configure it to suit your needs.
In this chapter, we will take a look at what can be done with the help of ADempiere 
accounting configuration. This includes the following parts:
Chart of accounts
Accounting dimensions
Accounting schema
Commitment accounting
General Ledger distribution
Product costs
From the previous chapters, we have learned what standard accounting facts 
and GL journal entries are generated when performing the sample business 
cycle activities. After completing this chapter, and after you have an idea of the 
ADempiere accounting behavior, you need to configure ADempiere in the actual 
implementation, after performing the initial client setup.

Managing ADempiere accounts
Managing a chart of accounts for an organization is usually an accountant's 
responsibility. Although most of us are not accountants, we can try to understand 
what an account is, what a chart of accounts is, and how to map an organization's 
accounts through ADempiere. We will discuss these topics in the upcoming sections.
Chart of accounts
A Chart of accounts is a list of the names of the accounts that an organization 
has accredited for recording transactions. This list of accounts can be numeric, 
alphabetic, or even alpha-numeric.
In standard accounting, the term Account is defined as a unique identifier that is 
used to retrieve and store information in the General Ledger. As you have seen in 
our previous transaction example, an organization will have an 'account receivable' 
account that is used when creating an invoice for a customer and/or when receiving 
a payment from the customer.
Throughout our examples in ADempiere, we will use numbers to identify an 
organization's accounts, and alphabets to identify account names. With the sample 
chart of accounts provided in the ADempiere binary installation, you have the 
flexibility to rebuild your own chart of accounts to suit your organization's needs.
In the chart of accounts, we can typically classify accounts as:
Balance sheet accounts
Assets
Liabilities
Owner's equity
Income statement accounts
Operating revenues
Operating expenses
Non-operating revenues and gains
Non-operating expenses and losses
All of the above types will influence the creation of a financial statement. With the 
help of a general ledger, which contains account transactions, you can generate 
periodic financial statement reports, such as the extraction of account balances from 
the Trial Balance reports, measuring the performance of the organization through 
Profit and Loss statements, and so on.

A journey through the ADempiere list of 
accounts
When creating the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd client, we will require a predefined 
chart of accounts. In Chapter 3, Exploring Company Structures and the Initial Client 
Setup, we discussed the standard ADempiere format for charts of accounts and 
imported a sample chart of accounts during the initial client setup.
The entire list of accounts from the sample chart of accounts that is imported can be 
accessed through the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Account 
Element window. This window contains three tabs: Element, Element Value, and 
Sub Account.
The Element tab contains one record, which mentions a standard account type as 
the primary natural account being used in the ADempiere system, while the Element 
Value tab lists all of your existing accounts (in area number 1) and the details of the 
account definition (in area number 2, below), as shown in the following screenshot:
When using AccountingUS.csv files, we assume that the chart of accounts is a 
complete list of accounts. You will be able to edit or add to this account listing 
to suit your organization's accounting requirements.

Adding more accounts
In a real organization, sooner or later, you will need to add more accounts.
I need to enter a new account. Can you assist me with this task?
Suppose you want to add your own deposit account. Click on the New button, and in 
area number 2 of the Element Value tab, complete the following information fields:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 This account should be accessible to all other organizations in this client.
3.	 Set the Search Key field to 19500.
4.	 Set theName field to Deposit Account.
5.	 Set the Account Type field to Asset.
6.	 Here, you can set your account type. In this case, we will use the Asset type 
of account.
7.	 Set the Account Sign field to Natural.
8.	 This field indicates whether the expected balance for this account should be 
a Debit or a Credit. If we set it to Natural, the account sign will follow the 
default expected balance for that account type.
9.	 Deselect the Summary Level checkbox.
10.	 A transaction can be posted to any account that is not summary level. A 
Summary Level account is an account whose balance represents the total 
balance of other account balances.
11.	 Select the Post Actual and Post Budget checkboxes.
12.	 This means that we can use and post this account in the actual and budget 
posting type. You are also free to set this account up as a statistical 
posting type.
After saving the new deposit account, the account does not, by default, have an 
account parent. Take a look at the previous screenshot. An example of an account 
that has an account parent is 11100 (Checking Account). This, in turn, has Cash as 
its account parent. The Cash account itself has Assets as its account parent.
Now that we have decided to set 19 (Other Assets) as the created account's parent, 
all we need to do is drag-and-drop this newly-created account in area number 1 of 
the previous screenshot from Assets to the Other Assets summary account. The 
Other Assets total balance will thus contain the sum of all of the account balances 
that have Other Assets as its account parent, including our newly-created Deposit 
Account's account.

Chapter 7
[ 223 ]
Summary accounts option
Now, we have an account 19500 (Deposit Account). This account is not set up as a 
Summary Level account. Without this attribute, we can post a transaction by using 
this account as a posting account. This means that we can use this account to post our 
transactions that come from Material Receipt, Invoice (Customer), or GL Journal, or 
other type of transactions.
Have a look at the 19 (Other Assets) account. This is an example of a Summary 
Level account. This account is a non-posting account, having summary level account 
attributes. We cannot use this account in the transactions that are aimed to be 
a summary entity to all accounts having 19 (Other Assets) account as their 
account parent.
In a hierarchy, a Summary Level account can contain:
One or more non-posting or summary accounts
One or more posting or transaction accounts
Check out the following screenshot:
The Other Assets sample posting account contains:
One summary: Intangible Assets, which contains several posting accounts.
Three posting accounts: Deposit Account, Cash Surrender Value of Life 
Insurance, and Other Assets.
You can examine Accounts Receivable as another example of a Summary 
Level account.

Document Controlled option
The other option available when we set up or alter an account is the Document 
Controlled attribute. This option will appear when the account is not set as a 
Summary Level account.
When we set an account as Document Controlled, it means that we prepare this 
account to use as a target default account for ADempiere documents like the 
following target 'default' account:
MM Receipt: This document is in use in the Material Receipt window
AR Invoice: This document is in use in the Invoice (Customer) window
When account is selected as Document Controlled, we cannot use this account 
in a non-document driven (non-document related) transaction, such as the direct 
GL Journal transaction.
For example, the 14120 (Product Asset) and 21190 (Not invoiced receipts) accounts 
have been flagged as Document Controlled accounts, and will be used internally 
to generate accounting facts/GL journal entries when posting a document, such as 
the MM Receipt document in the Material Receipt window.
If you have a GL journal transaction with an account having the Document 
Controlled attribute, then you will get an error message when you try to post this 
transaction. To simulate this case, navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | 
GL Journal window, and carry out the following procedure:
1.	 In the Batch tab, set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Description field to Test document controlled.
3.	 Set the Posting Type field to Actual.
4.	 Set the Document Type field to GL Journal, and then click on the Save button.
5.	 Navigate to the Journal tab, set the Description field to Journal Test, and 
then click on the Save button.
6.	 Navigate to the Line tab. In the Combination field, click on the small red 
button. This will display a Combination form. Enter 14120 in the Alias field, 
and click on the ReQuery button (in the top right-hand side of the form). 
Now that the 14120 - Product Asset account is available, click on the 
OK button.
7.	 Set the Source Debit field to 100, and then click on the Save button.
8.	 We will now enter our credit journal. Click on the New button, and navigate 
to the Combination field. Double-click on it, and ensure that you are using 
the 73100 – Postage Expense account.
9.	 Set the Source Credit field to 100, and then click on the Save button.
10.	 Navigate back to the Batch tab, and click on the Complete button.

In the window's status bar, you will get a red-colored error message—Account used

Post Actual, Budget, and Statistical options
Like Document Controlled, the Post Actual, Post Budget, and Post Statistical 
checkboxes are shown or available only when an account is not set as Summary Level.
When entering a GL journal transaction, we can set up a Posting Type for any 
transaction. The available Posting types are:
Actual
Budget
Statistical
Commitment
Reservation
We have a stationery budget of IDR 5,000,000 for our office operations. Can 
you explain to me how our example budget (stationery budget) and this topic 
are related?
One of the targets of a company's performance evaluation purpose is comparing 
the actual expenditure with the budget. In ADempiere, we will enter our budget 
transaction through the GL Journal window, and you will have to use Budget as 
its Posting Type. When entering the real or actual expenses, we will use one of the 
following two options:
Book this transaction within GL Journal and use Actual as its Posting Type
or
Post an ADempiere document that affects the expenses type of account
With existing budget and actual transaction records, the manager can create reports 
to compare account balances between them, and can take appropriate action with the 
help of this information.
You can create a GL journal transaction for any posting type, but you can only use 
the Actual posting type to post a document-driven transaction. If we set this account 
without the Post Actual attribute, then when posting a document-driven transaction 
that uses this account, you will get a red-colored error message in the window's 
status bar—Account does not have Post Actual attribute, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Introducing accounting dimensions
You may have experienced that when managing and analyzing your outstanding 
Account Receivable trade account, you needed to create a special account in the chart 
of accounts for each of your customers, in order to capture and show the customer's 
AR trade balances, as shown in the table below:
Account
Customer name
Balance
12110
Customer A
1000
12111
Customer B
1500
12112
Customer C
1750
Even though you can use this approach when implementing ADempiere in your 
organization, it is suggested that you create only one Account Receivable trade 
account in the system.
If we use only one Account Receivable trade account, then how do we know the 
Account Receivable balances of each of our customers?
When posting a document, there is some information that gets recorded, in addition 
to the account information itself. Take a look at one of the examples from the 
available AR Invoice posting documents in the Invoice (Customer) window. This 
gives you the accounting entries information in the Account Viewer window, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
[ 227 ]
ADempiere automatically inserts additional Business Partner's information in these 
accounting entries! Therefore, even if you have hundreds or thousands of AR trade 
accounting entries, they will appear as shown in the table below:
Account
Customer Name
Amount
12110
Customer A
1000
12110
Customer B
1500
12110
Customer C
1750
With that information, you can create the outstanding Account Receivable trade 
balances by grouping the information on the business partner column.
In addition to the Account and Business Partner information, as seen in the previous 
screenshot, ADempiere will also give us the Organization and Product information. 
This will be generated automatically, based on the configuration and the available 
information in the document.
When receiving material, ADempiere generates the Product information in its 
accounting entries. This is another example of Product information that is generated 
automatically. Thus, there is no need to set a different Product Asset account for 
each of your products, as the information is already present.
Through this example, we have seen that there is information available for several 
entities such as Organization, Account, Product, Business Partner, Project, 
Campaign, and Sales Region. These are known as accounting dimensions. These 
accounting dimensions, containing unique information, join together to construct 
accounting facts or GL journal entries, and can be used to create a complex analysis 
according to your needs.
Re-posting a document
Before we discuss the accounting configuration, you need to know about a special 
feature related to the document posting behavior. In ADempiere, we can force the 
system to re-post a document.
When re-posting a document, ADempiere will:
Drop the existing accounting facts or GL journal entries belonging to 
this document
Re-read all of the accounting configuration and accounting 
information involved
Generate new accounting facts or GL journal entries based on the new 
accounting configuration information
•
•
•

Accounting Information and Configuration
[ 228 ]
Re-posting a document should only be done for open accounting 
periods.
After changing the accounting configuration in the Accounting Schema window, we 
need to force the ADempiere system to get the latest configuration, by performing 
the following tasks:
1.	 Log out from the ADempiere client application.
2.	 Shut down the ADempiere application server.
3.	 Re-start the ADempiere application server.
4.	 Log in again to the ADempiere client application.
In this case, we will log in with the user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, 
Ltd Admin as the role, Shirt as the organization, and 1st Shirt W/h as 
the warehouse.
5.	 Re-post your document.
How do we re-post the document?
Because you have the rights to access the Posted button in the window (actually, 
the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin role has these accounting rights), just click on 
this button. In the upcoming Account Viewer window, as shown in the following 
screenshot, find the Re-Post button, and click on it:
You will be prompted with a confirmation window, stating Post now and 
create Accounting entries. Click on the OK button to finalize the re-posting 
document activities.

A walkthrough of the Accounting 
Schema
The mother of all accounting configuration setups is the Accounting Schema 
window. Here, you can determine the behavior of the accounting entries in your 
own ADempiere installation by changing the default configuration. Navigate to the 
Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Accounting Schema window. 
This window contains four tabs: Accounting Schema, Account Schema Element, 
General Ledger, and Defaults. We will discuss these in more detail, with regard 
to what information is provided in each of tabs, in the following sections.
Exploring the Accounting Schema tab
There are some configurations available in this tab, which include how to make our 
system an accrual- or cash-based accounting system, the Commitment Type, the 
Costing Method to be used, and so on.
The complete list of configurations that can be managed is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Accounting Information and Configuration
[ 230 ]
We will explain each of the available options in the following sections.
GAAP
GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) is a collection of methods used 
to process, prepare, and present public accounting information. Each country may 
have its own methods to achieve its accounting standards.
In ADempiere, the options for the GAAP field are: Custom Accounting Rules, 
International GAAP, German HGB, and so on.
By default, during client creation, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(GAAP) would be set to International GAAP. Up to the current version of 
ADempiere, the value in this field does not affect the ADempiere accounting engine, 
and is preserved for future use.
Commitment Type
Commitment accounting allows the posting of expenses prior to the creation or 
collection of the underlying documents, such as invoices, purchase orders, and so on, 
and before these committed funds are paid out. This allows the accounting entries 
to reflect in the allocation of budgetary resources when they are committed, instead 
of when they are paid out, thus providing earlier financial information than the 
'budget and actual' reports and preventing budget overruns. We can set commitment 
accounting through the Commitment Type field.
Standard ADempiere configuration sets Commitment Type to None as the 
default value. We can set this value to PO/SO Commitment/Reservation, or any 
combination of PO, SO, Commitment, and Reservation. This configuration will 
determine the additional accounting facts or GL journal entries, that are generated 
when posting a requisition, purchase order, sales order, and invoice transaction. 
These additional accounting fact entries use Reservation and/or Commitment as 
their posting type, instead of Actual. We will practice these parts later.
Accrual- or cash-based accounting
Accrual-based accounting is an accounting method where revenues and expenses 
are recognized when they are accrued, that is, accumulated (earned or incurred), 
regardless of whether the actual cash has been received or paid out.
As a default, ADempiere uses accrual-based accounting, instead of cash-based 
accounting, when creating a new client.

Chapter 7
[ 231 ]
Costing method and costing level
Cost accounting is an approach to evaluating the overall cost to run a business. 
Based on standard accounting practices, cost accounting is one of the tools that can 
be used by the manager to support decision making, in order to cut a company's cost 
and improve profitability.
In ADempiere, we use Costing Method to set up our cost accounting model. 
The standard used in ADempiere is the Standard Costing costing method. This 
is set as default for all new client creations. The following is a list of available 
costing methods:
Standard Costing
Average PO
Average Invoice
FIFO
LIFO
Although there are many more costing methods available, up to the current 
ADempiere version, the most implemented features are Standard Costing and 
Average PO.
Standard Costing means the amount the company thinks a product 
should cost for a period of time, based on economic conditions, certain 
assumed conditions, and other factors.
Another part of cost accounting determination in ADempiere is the Costing Level. 
As a default value, Costing Level is set to Client. The options for Costing Level are:
Client
Organization
Batch/Lot
When we set the costing method to Standard Costing and the costing level to Client, 
throughout this book, it means that we need to set a standard cost for each of the 
products in the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd client level (only once). 
Using Organization as the costing level means that we need to set a standard cost 
for each of the products in all of the organizations available in a certain Client. You 
need to set up a standard cost for each of the products in the Dress, Shirt, and Jacket 
organizations, in this case.

Accounting Information and Configuration
[ 232 ]
In addition to Standard Costing, another cost accounting method type 
available in the standard accounting term is Actual Costing. Actual 
Costing is the actual amount paid or incurred. Unfortunately, there are 
no actual costing methods within ADempiere. Although there are no 
options to set this type of costing, we can acquire actual costing by setting 
Costing Method to Average PO and Costing Level to Batch/Lot.
The costing method and costing level configuration in Accounting Schema is the 
mother of all cost accounting calculations and implementations for all of our products. 
However, this costing method can be overridden by costing methods and costing 
levels, which are configured at the Product Category level. If there are no costing 
models and costing levels specified at the Product Category level (both of the Costing 
Method and Costing Level fields are blank) then all the products belonging to this 
Product Category will use the costing model and costing level information from the 
Accounting Schema level. However, if costing models and costing levels are specified, 
then use the Product Category configuration instead.
Currency
During client creation, there is an option to set up the main currency. You can set 
it up in the Currency field. This currency will be used as the main currency for our 
accounting schema. Using USD as our main currency does not mean that we cannot 
use a currency other than USD in a transaction.
In our example for managing landed costs in Chapter 6, Landed Costs, Production, and 
Sales Activities, we used IDR as our transaction currency. If we have a multi-currency 
transaction like this one, then ADempiere should keep the original transaction values 
in the Source Debit or Source Credit fields, and the converted USD values are stored 
in the Accounted Debit or Accounted Credit parts, through the accounting facts or 
GL journal entries generated. Generally, we can use this accounted information when 
generating a financial statement for analysis purposes.
Periods controlling
For controlling the periodic parts, by default, there is an Automatic Period Control 
checkbox, in a selected state. With this configuration, ADempiere will automatically 
check for the active periods (via the Periods field), and the criteria of History Days 
and Future Days, when completing a document.

Chapter 7
[ 233 ]
With Oct-09 as the active period (refer to the Periods field from the Accounting 
Schema tab), 2 as history days, and 2 as future days information, and let's say that 
it is Oct 12, 2009; then system will allow the posting of documents for the Oct-09 
period, while the document date or account date can be between two days before 
and two days after Oct 12, 2009. When performing a transaction outside of these 
dates, the system will generate a Period Closed error message.
Use Account Alias
When working with a GL journal transaction, or altering default account 
information, we will use an account combination. By determining what kind of 
account combination will be used for these activities, it will be easier to perform a 
search of this account combination by using the alias of this account combination.
The Use Account Alias checkbox is in a selected state by default. With this 
configuration, you can set an alias for each of the account combinations 
registered in the Account Combination window, and use its alias to identify 
the account combination.
Do you remember that you have already created a Shirt-14120-_-_-_-_-_ account 
combination, and specified 14120 as its alias? When using this account combination 
in your transaction, you need to do the following in the Account Dialog window:
1.	 Click on the Undo Changes button.
2.	 Set your account combination Alias.
3.	 Click on the ReQuery button to get your account combination.
4.	 Click on the OK button to finalize, as shown in the following screenshot:

Accounting Information and Configuration
[ 234 ]
Post Trade Discount
The ADempiere system does not select the Post Trade Discount option by default. In 
case you want to post a discount value that is reflected in the accounting facts or GL 
journal entries, then you need to select this option. The transaction for trade discount 
will be booked when posting an AR Invoice or AR Credit Memo document through 
the Invoice (Customer) window.
In our test case chart of accounts, the accounts related to discount are:
Trade Discount Received (59100) 
Trade Discount Granted (49100)
To support our further example assuming that you do not have enough stock of Shirt 
Finished Goods, you need to:
1.	 Manufacture 1 Shirt Finished Goods product through the Production 
window (refer to the Production section of Chapter 6, Landed Cost, Production, 
and Sales Activities for details of how to manufacture a product).
2.	 Next, you need to select the Post Trade Discount option, and save your 
changes. Log off from the ADempiere client, re-start your ADempiere server, 
and then re-login to the ADempiere client. 
We will give you an example of the impact of selecting the Post Trade Discount 
option, by examining the accounting fact/GL journal entry generated. Create more 
instances of Sales Order and finalize them with an AR Invoice document through 
the Invoice (Customer) window, as follows:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Orders | Sales Order 
window. If this does not show an inserted status in the Order tab, click on 
the New button, and then set the following information:
Set the Organization field to Shirt
Set the Target Document Type field to Standard Order
Set the Date Ordered and Date Promised fields to today's date
Set the Business Partner field to Liz Claiborne
Set the Warehouse field to 1st Shirt W/h
Set the Invoice Rule field to Immediate
Set the Price List field to Sales PL, and then click on the Save button

2.	 Navigate to the Order Line tab, and do the following:
Set the Product with Shirt Finished Goods, the Qty field to 1, and the 
UOM field to Piece.
Set the Price and Unit Price fields to 18, and the List Price field 
to 20. Then we will have a 10 percent of discount value 
(automatically calculated).
Set the Tax field to Standard (there is no need to generate tax during 
this test case), and then click on the Save button. We will thus have a 
document with a total value of $18.
3.	 Navigate back to the Order tab, and complete this document.
4.	 Assuming that we are bypassing the shipment processes, we will directly 
generate invoices. Navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales 
Invoices | Generate Invoices (manual) window.
Set the Organization field to Shirt, the Document Type field to Order, 
and there will be a list of Standard Order document available (showing 
our previously-created Standard Order document).
Select the required records, and finalize the document by clicking on the 
OK button, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 Now, navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Invoices | Invoice 
(Customer) window. Find your newly-generated invoice. It will have a 
complete document status.

Check out the accounting facts or GL journal entry generated by this invoice, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
There are additional 49100 – Trade Discount journal entries! The Accounted Debit 
trade discount value (which is 2) is a result of the following equation:
( List Price – Unit Price ) * Qty
Post services separately
When creating a product through the Product window, you need to specify 
the Product Type information. As you already know, product type options are: 
Expense Type, Item, Resource, and Service.
If we set the product type to Service and select the Post Service Separately option, 
then when posting our AR Invoice document, it will be posted to the Receivable 
Services default account (12115), instead of the Customer Receivables default 
account (12110).
You can examine the Receivable Services standard default account being used, 
through the Business Partner window, navigating to the Customer Accounting 
tab, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
[ 237 ]
Explicit Cost Adjustment
This option will generate optional accounting facts or GL journal entries when 
posting our invoice document through the Invoice (Vendor) window under 
following conditions:
It has AP Invoice or AP Credit Memo as its Target Document Type
The invoice is a landed cost type of transaction
For our example, revisit the Landed cost discussion in Chapter 6, Landed Costs, 
Production, and Sales Activities. In that section, we had assigned a transportation 
cost to our raw material. When we select the Explicit Cost Adjustment option 
and re-post this document, the accounting facts/GL journal entries generated 
are as shown in the following screenshot:
If we compare these with the original accounting facts, we will find that there are 
some additional accounting facts/GL journal entries: Dr 73300 – Shipping Expenses 
and Cr 73300 – Shipping Expenses. 
Because this landed cost transaction uses Transportation as its type of charge, 
the additional 73300 – Shipping Expenses account journal entries are taken from the 
Charge Expense default account of the Transportation type of charges (refer to the 
Setting transportation charges section of Chapter 6, Landed Costs, Production, and 
Sales Activities).
Allow Negative Posting
When entering a transaction such as a GL Journal transaction, ADempiere can 
and will proceed with both positive and negative amounts, by default. Deselecting 
this option does not mean that we are able to set a positive amount only. Whatever 
the configuration of this option is, it will still allow us to enter both positive and 
negative amounts.
•
•

Accounting Information and Configuration
[ 238 ]
The impact of selecting this option is seen in the journal position of its accounting 
facts entries. Suppose we have the following GL journal entries transaction:
Sign
Description
Amount 
Dr
71200 – Subscription Fees
-100
Cr
73100 – Postage Expenses
-100
Then the accounting facts/GL journal generated will look like the ones shown in the 
following screenshot:
Otherwise, if we deselect the Allow Negative Posting option and re-post this 
document, then the accounting facts or GL journal entries generated will look 
like the ones shown in the following screenshot:
In short, this option will either allow or disallow negative posting of accounting facts 
and journal entries. If we deselect the Allow Negative Posting option, then when 
posting a negative amount, the journal created is the opposite of the original debit 
or credit transaction, and is accompanied by a positive amount.
It is recommended that you deselect this option in the configuration.

Chapter 7
[ 239 ]
Post if Clearing Equal
If you do not need the Product Inventory Clearing journal entries in the Matched 
Invoices records and AP Invoice document, then you should deselect the Post if 
Clearing Equal option.
The decision to select this option or not depends on your business requirements. If 
you need to trace the relationship between the invoice and your material receipt, 
based on the accounting information generated from the AP Invoice and MM Receipt 
documents, then the credit journal or credit amount of the Product Inventory Clearing 
accounting entries can be used for this purpose.
Based on accounting entries, how do we know the relationship between the invoice 
and our material receipt?
So far, you have accessed the accounting facts or GL journal entries through the 
Account Viewer window. The complete list of accounting facts/GL journal entries 
is accessible through the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Fact Details 
window. Navigate to this window, and locate the 51290 – Product Inventory 
Clearing account that has a credit journal or credit amount. The following 
screenshot example is taken from the author's ADempiere records:
If you click on the Record ID button, then the system will show you a Matched 
Invoices window that shows the relation between the AP Invoice and the MM 
Receipt document.

[ 240 ]
The Account Schema Element tab
When creating a new Client (refer to the section Creating a new ADempiere client of 
Chapter 3, Exploring Company Structures and Initial Client Setup), there are Optional 
checkboxes that need to be set up. In Chapter 3, we selected the Business Partner, 
Product, Project, Campaign, and Sales Region options.
After selecting these options, all of the optional parts are saved on the Account 
Schema Element tab, as shown in the following screenshot:
Other than the Business Partner, Product, Project, Campaign, and Sales Region 
account schema elements, this tab also has Organization and Account as 
mandatory account schema elements.
Throughout this book, we have seen that the ADempiere system has seven 
account schema elements available. For the minimum of ADempiere 
account schema elements registered, ADempiere requires at least the 
Organization, Account, Product, and BPartner account schema elements.
As you have seen in the Introducing the accounting dimensions section earlier in this 
chapter, the seven active options from the list of account schema elements should 
be used to activate and generate Accounting Dimension information that is taken 
from available data in the document (Standard Order, AR Invoice, and so on), 
and actualize this information in the accounting fact/GL journal entries generated.
Adding campaign information
To improve our sales and profitability, we need to set a marketing campaign for 
promoting our products. From this marketing campaign's activities, the company 
expects more sales, which will improve its profitability. To measure the effectiveness 
of this marketing campaign, we can activate a Campaign accounting schema 
element, and assign the campaign information to all of the documents related 

Chapter 7
[ 241 ]
to this campaign (for example, purchases, sales, total expenses incurred, and so on). 
As a result, we will be able to analyze the contribution of this campaign, in an effort 
to improve our sales and profitability.
Let us create an AP Invoice document, and set the Campaign information in this 
document by performing the following steps:
1.	 First, we need to set up additional campaign information, let's say for the 
Anniversary Campaign. Navigate to the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales 
and Marketing | Marketing Campaign window.
2.	 Click on the New button, and set the following information:
Set the Organization to *
Set both the Search Key and Name fields to Anniversary Campaign
3.	 Click on the Save button.
In our campaign activities, we still need to create the Purchase Order and 
MM Receipt documents before proceeding with the AP Invoice. As we 
are here to see the impact of account element configuration, we will only 
create an AP Invoice document, to simplify things.
4.	 Navigate to the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Invoice (Vendor) window. 
Set the following information on the Invoice tab:
Set the Organization field to Shirt
Set the Target Document Type field to AP Invoice
Set the Date Invoice and Account Date fields to today's date
Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited
Set the Campaign field to Anniversary Campaign, and then click on the 
Save button
5.	 Navigate to the Invoice Line tab, and set the following information:
Set the Product field to S Fabric, the Qty field to 80, and the UOM field 
to Meter
Set the Price field to 3.80
Set the Tax field to Standard
Set the Campaign to Anniversary Campaign, and then click on the 
Save button

accounting facts/GL journal entry generated. This will contain the campaign 
information, taken from the Campaign accounting dimension, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
Registering another account schema element
ADempiere has the ability to add additional account schema elements. By using this 
capability, we can add built-in account schema elements that are not yet registered 
on the Account Schema Element tab. For example, the Activity account schema 
element. We will practice how to register Activity as a member of our account 
schema element. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Activity 
(ABC) window. On the Activity tab, set and save the following information:
Set the Organization field to *
Set the Search Key and Name field to Our Sample Activity
2.	 Navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | 
Accounting Schema window. In the Account Schema Element tab, 
add and save the following information:
Set the Name field to Activity
Set the Type field to Activity (choose from the available list)
Set the Activity field to Our Sample Activity

3.	 When saving information in the Accounting Schema window, you will be 
prompted by a confirmation window, as shown in the following screenshot:
As mentioned, to make your changes effective, you need to restart your application 
server, and then re-login with your ADempiere user ID.
With your new configuration, navigate to the Invoice (Vendor) window. The 
Invoice tab will contain additional Reference information, Activity, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
Next time, when you are entering Activity information at the document level, such 
as for an AP Invoice document, when posting this document, ADempiere will insert 
the Activity information into the accounting facts/GL journal entries generated.
Deactivating the account schema element
If our business does not require information such as Activity, Project, Campaign, 
and Sales Region in its generated accounting facts/GL journal entries, then we 
can make this account schema element inactive.

Accounting Information and Configuration
[ 244 ]
Although we are able to delete this account schema element directly, it is 
recommended that you set this account schema element as inactive.
After restarting your application server and logging in to the application, again 
your changes will be effective. Again, check your Invoice (Vendor) window. It will 
not contain Reference any more! Create your own new AP Invoice document and 
Complete the document. Examine the accounting fact/GL journal entries generated.
Avoiding the Intercompany Due From/To journal 
entries
When explaining accounting facts/GL journal entries generated, in the Cash Payment 
Allocation section in Chapter 5, Procurement Activities, we came across additional 
journal entries when we had a transaction that used multiple organizations, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
As you can see from the previous screenshot, the Intercompany Due To account 
is designed to set a journal balance entry in the Shirt organization, whereas 
Intercompany Due From sets a journal balance entry in the Dress organization. With 
this journal, if you create financial statement reports for a certain organization, these 
reports will give you a balance of the total debit against the total credit amount.
If needed, we can avoid the Intercompany journal entries. This can be done by 
deselecting the Balanced checkbox in the Organization's account schema element, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
[ 245 ]
By re-posting the View Allocation document, both of the Intercompany journal 
entries are gone!
The General Ledger and Defaults tabs
The Defaults tab carries a list of the ADempiere default accounts. These entries are 
based on the AccountingUS.csv default account, which was explained in Chapter 3, 
Exploring Company Structures and Initial Client Setup, in the Managing Chart of accounts 
template section.
On the General Ledger tab, it's recommended that you select Use Suspense 
Balancing, Use Suspense Error, and Use Currency Balancing. Furthermore, you 
can alter the account combination for the list of available default accounts, to suit 
your needs.
On the Defaults tab, the default accounts will be grouped according to their own 
purpose/target/reference, such as:
Business Partner
Product
Warehouse
Project
Bank
Tax
Cash book

[ 246 ]
The Charge Expense and Charge Revenue default accounts in the General group 
will be used for the Charge document.
When creating a new Business Partner Group, Product Group, Warehouse, Project, 
Bank Account, Tax Rate, or Cashbook reference record, the list of default accounts 
configuration, which is available in the Accounting tab for each of those entities, 
will be copied from the standard default account available on the Defaults tab of 
Accounting Schema window.
For example, when creating a new Business Partner Group, the default account 
listed in the Accounting tab was taken from the Accounting Schema default account 
for Business Partner. As another example, when creating a new Product Category, 
the default account listed in the Accounting tab was taken from Accounting Schema 
default account for Product.
Avoiding Product Inventory Clearing 
journal entries
As shown in the Managing vendor invoices section of Chapter 5, Procurement Activities, 
when posting a document in the Matched Invoices and Invoice (Vendor) window, 
ADempiere generates the Product Inventory Clearing journal. There is an option to 
eliminate the Product Inventory Clearing journal entries when posting an AP Invoice 
document in the Invoice (Vendor) window, and Match Invoice document in the 
Matched Invoices window.
Prerequisites
There is some configuration that needs to be done to achieve these tasks:
1.	 Deselect the Post if Clearing Equal checkbox:
Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | 
Accounting Schema window. In the Accounting Schema tab, you 
will find a Post if Clearing Equal checkbox. Deselect this checkbox.
2.	 Create a new 21190 - Not invoiced receipts account combination:
In the Account Combination window, enter a new account combination 
record with:
Alias field set to 21190
Organization field set to Shirt
Account field set to 21190

3.	 Set the Not-invoiced Receipts default account of the targeted Business Partner 
Group to the newly-created 21190-Not invoiced receipts account combination:
In the Menu | Partner Relations | Business Partner Rules | Business 
Partner Group window, find the Import business partner group for our 
example. Go to the Accounting tab and find its Not-invoiced Receipts 
field. Change the account combination value to the newly-created 21190 
account combination.
4.	 Set the Product Inventory Clearing default account of the targeted product 
to the newly-created 21190-Not invoiced receipts account combination:
In the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | 
Product window, create your new product, named S Testing products (refer 
to the Product management section of Chapter 4, Setting up Master Data and 
Knowing its Accounting Configuration for details on registering new products), 
and set the following information:
Set the Product Category to Raw Material.
Set the Locator to Loc S1A.
Deselect the Sold checkbox.
On the Price tab, create new records, and set the Price List Version to 
Purchase PL March version, and enter 100 in the List Price, Standard 
Price and Limit Price fields.
Navigate to the Accounting tab, and find the Inventory Clearing field. 
Change the account combination value to the newly-created 21190 
account combination.
Testing the configuration
You can create the Purchase Order, MM Receipts (through Material Receipt 
window) and AP Invoice document, using the S Testing product and Hempel 
China Limited as its business partner, in order to test this configuration.
Accounting facts
With this configuration, when posting both the AP Invoice and Match Invoice 
documents, the system does not generate Product Inventory Clearing journal 
entries if it meets the following conditions:
S Testing products are used in both the Purchase Order and AP

Practicing commitment accounting
As previously mentioned in the Commitment Type section of this chapter, we can 
use commitment type accounting as a tool to provide financial information before 
"budget to actual" reports, and prevent budget overrun. In the following sections, 
we will implement commitment accounting and analyze the accounting facts/GL 
journal entries generated.
Prerequisites
We can activate commitment accounting through the Accounting Schema window. 
There is a list of options that can be used to enable commitment accounting. The 
options are:
PO Commitment only
PO Commitment & Reservation
SO Commitment only
SO Commitment & Reservation
PO;SO Commitment

For our reference, monitoring the expenses incurred in the purchase activity can be 
done by enabling PO Commitment & Reservation in our accounting engine, which 
we can do by performing the following steps:
1.	 In the Accounting Schema window, navigate to the Accounting Schema tab, 
and set the Commitment Type field to PO Commitment & Reservation.
2.	 Log off the ADempiere client application.
3.	 Restart the ADempiere application server by shutting down the server and 
then starting the server again.
4.	 Log in to the ADempiere client application again.
With the help of the accounting facts or GL journal entries that will be generated, we 
can create reports that show a prediction of expenses progression.
Requisition reservation
Monitoring budget activities can be initiated at the time of creating a purchase 
requisition document. Here, we will utilize the existing Purchase Requisition 
document in the Requisition window, which we saw in the Completing the replenish 
information section of Chapter 5, Procurement Activities.

We need to re-post this document, in order to show the accounting facts/GL 
journal entry generated. The following is a sample journal entry for our 
Purchase Requisition document:

Purchase Order Commitment and Reservation
In the previous Purchase Requisition document, the purchasing manager could 
monitor whether the expenses that were generated by this document exceeded a 
predetermined purchase budget. He or she could use the Product Expense account's 
outstanding balance in the active accounting periods (which uses both Reservation 
and Commitment as its posting type) as one of the many factors when making this 
decision. When we pass this condition, we can continue to generate a Purchase 
Order document based on this Purchase Requisition.
We will use the existing Purchase Order document that we obtained from the 
activities performed in the Creating a Purchase Order from a Purchase Requisition 
section of Chapter 5, Procurement Activities. Select the purchase order document 
that contains S Fabric in its ordered products.

General Ledger distribution
We had an electricity bill of USD 1,500 this month. This bill covered electricity 
consumption for the Dress, Jacket, and Shirt organizations. Previously, we just 
entered these transactions one-by-one depending on the organization's allocation. 
Can ADempiere help us in such cases?
Yes, of course, ADempiere can help you with this issue. You can enter your total 
bill in a single transaction itself, and this amount will be distributed or allocated by 
ADempiere based on a predefined configuration. All you need to do is to configure 
your distribution percentage to all of the available organizations once, and then 
ADempiere will take care of the rest of the transaction.
Concept of GL distribution
There is some basic information that needs to be known, such as how to configure 
such a distribution. Navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting 
Rules | GL Distribution window. This contains two tabs: Distribution and Line. The 
important configuration of the Distribution tab is shown in the following screenshot:
Distribution tab configuration
The following is a list of the configuration elements of the Distribution tab:
Organization field
You need to define on which organization this configuration should be 
applied. Here, we put *, which means that this configuration should be 
applicable to all of the available organizations.
•

Chapter 7
[ 253 ]
Accounting Schema field
If you have more than one accounting schema, then you can define to which 
Accounting Schema this configuration should be applied. As we only have 
one accounting schema registered, this configuration will be applied to the 
default Sistematika Fashion, Ltd UN/34 US Dollar accounting schema only.
Posting Type field
There are five available posting types. They are: Actual, Budget, 
Commitment, Reservation, and Statistical. If you select one of these, for 
example the Actual posting type, then this configuration will be applied to 
the Actual transaction type only. If there are no values in this field, then this 
configuration will be applicable to all posting types.
Document Type field
There are many document types available. The list of document types is 
available in the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | 
Document Type window. As for posting type, you can pick one of the 
document types to work with. If there are no values in this field, then 
this configuration will be applicable to all document types.
Account Schema Element Selection
The list of Selection values is taken from the Account Schema Element tab 
of the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Accounting 
Schema window. In the Selection section, we can define that the distribution 
should be applied to:
Any Organization or a specific Organization
Any Account or a specific Account
Any Activity or a specific Activity
And so on.
If we select the Any Account checkbox, then the configuration will be applied 
to all Accounts. Otherwise, if you deselect this option, then you have to set 
an Account value to work with, and this configuration will affect the selected 
Account only. This behavior is also applicable to the rest of the account schema 
element members (Organization, Activity, Product, Business Partner, Project, 
Campaign, and Sales Region).
Now, all of the information has been configured in the Accounting Schema, 
Posting Type, Document Type, and Account Schema Element Selection. If any 
transaction occurs that meets this configuration, then this transaction will be routed 
or distributed to the information in the Line tab.

Line tab configuration
When performing distribution tasks on the Line tab, you can set up many conditions 
here. When entering a configuration, you need to define the following parts:
Percent field
What percentage of the available amount or value should be allocated. 
Overwrite target Account Schema Element or not
In the Account schema element parts, there are options to:
Overwrite Organization or not
Overwrite Account or not
Overwrite Activity or not
And so on.
If you deselect the Overwrite Organization checkbox, then we will leave 
the available organization information as it is. If you select the Overwrite 
Organization checkbox, you can define the new target organization in the 
Organization field. This behavior is also applicable to the rest of the account 
schema element members (Account, Activity, Product, Business Partner, 
Project, Campaign, and Sales Region).
With the available records in the Line tab, ADempiere sets an internal check and 
verifies if the sum of the Percent field for all of the records registered in this Line 
tab is 100.
You can check the following screenshot for the configuration available in the Line tab:

Set the Organization field to *
Set the Name field to Sample of GL Distribution configuration
Set the Posting Type field to Actual
Set the Document Type field to GL Journal
By default, all account schema elements in the Selection area are in the selected state. 
Deselect the Any Account field, set 82900 – Other Expense in the Account field, and 
then continue by clicking on the Save button.
As we did not have a special electricity account in this case, we used the 
Other Expenses account.

Sample transactions and accounting facts
In accordance with the configuration above, we will practice the impact of this 
GL Distribution on the GL Journal transaction.
Creating a new account combination
When using the Other Expense account against the Cash In Registers account in 
a GL journal transaction (this is just an example), and because we do not have this 
account combination for both of the accounts, we need to create a new Account 
Combination. Navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | 
Account Combination window, and set and save the following information on 
the Combination tab:
Field\Data
1st Data
2nd Data
Alias
82900

Creating a new General Ledger Journal transaction
For this sample testing transaction, navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | 
GL Journal window. As you know, this window contains three tabs: Batch, Journal, 
and Line. In the Batch tab, set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Description field to Testing GL distribution.
3.	 Set the Posting Type field to Actual.
4.	 Set the Document Type field to GL Journal.
5.	 Set the Document Date and Account Date fields to today's date.
6.	 Set the Currency field to USD.
7.	 Set the Control Amount field to 1500.
Navigate to the Journal tab, and set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Description field to Electricity bill for this period.
2.	 Set the Control Amount field to 1500.
Leave the remaining fields with their default values.

Chapter 7
[ 257 ]
Navigate to the Line tab. On this tab, you may enter multiple records. First you 
need to enter your GL debit transaction information, and then continue by entering 
your GL credit transaction information. For our test case, you need to enter the 
following transactions:

After saving both the debit and credit transactions, we need to complete this 
document. Navigate to the Batch tab, complete this GL document, and then 
press the F5 key repeatedly, until you get the Posted status for this document.
Click on the Posted button, and the accounting facts generated are as shown, 
as in the following screenshot:
As you can see from these accounting facts, the first Other Expense journal (debit) is 
the original GL transaction, the second Other Expense journal (credit) is the reverse 
of the first journal entry, and in the third, fourth, and fifth Other Expense journal 
entries are allocated or distributed to each of the organizations.
Remember that this journal involves multi-organization transactions 
and has no Intercompany Due journal. This happened because 
we previously deselected the Balanced field in the Organization's 
account schema element, in the Avoiding the Intercompany Due From/
To journal entries section.

Product costs information
We have practiced procurement/material receiving, invoicing raw materials, 
recording transportation costs (as landed costs), production (making finished goods 
from raw materials), and finally selling the finished goods. All of these activities or 
events have financial information that is recorded in the Product Costs window.
Navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | Costing | Product Costs window. 
This contains five tabs. The most accessed information is in the first three tabs: Select 
Product, Product Costs, and Cost Details. In our example, navigate to the Select 
Product tab, set S Thread as an active record, and then navigate to the Cost Details 
tab. You can see the details of all of the transactions involved for this material, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the Created column, and these records are sorted based on the Created 
field, as you can see in the above screenshot. The last record, created on Sep 30, 
2009, is the result of the Material Receipt activity. System records have received 50 
Quantity of S Thread, having 1.60 as the Price. The next record created on Sep 30, 
2009 is a result of the Invoice (Vendor) activity. The next record, created on Oct 6, 
2009, results from the cost allocation of the transportation cost (landed costs) for 
this material. The last three records are created due to Production activities.

Chapter 7
[ 259 ]
All of the information related to this material in the Cost Details tab will be 
summarized based on the Cost Element specified on the Product Costs tab, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
As we set up the S Thread costing method as Average PO, we need to pay attention to 
the Freight and Average PO cost elements information. The sum value of the Current 
Cost Price of Freight and the Average PO cost elements is used for producing Shirt 
Finished Goods during the Production activity (0.5756 + 1.6 = 2.1756).
Summary
In this chapter, we saw the major accounting parts of configuration for ADempiere.
First, we discussed about the Account Element. During the initial client creation in 
the previous chapters, we had already configured a list of accounts in the chart of 
accounts file. All of these preconfigured accounts can be accessed from the Account 
Element window. You are free to add an additional account when needed. In 
this section, we also discussed the functions of the summary account and of the 
document controlled, post actual, budget, and statistical parts of an account.
The account itself is used when generating accounting facts/GL journal entries. In 
addition to the account, there are many other dimensions (such as product, business 
partner, and so on) involved, and these are all joined together to construct accounting 
facts and GL journal information.

Accounting Information and Configuration
[ 260 ]
Then we discussed the heart of ADempiere accounting configuration, that is, the 
Accounting Schema. In this, we covered the configuration for commitment type, 
accrual and cash-based accounting, costing method and costing level for products 
valuation, main currency, periods controlling, using account alias, impact of post 
trade discount when we activate this option, posting services separately, additional 
accounting facts while activating explicit cost adjustment, disallowing negative 
posting in its accounting facts, and the reasons for using the post if clearing 
equal option.
We continued our discussion with the account schema element. Our initial client 
creation consisted of organization, account, product, business partner, project, 
campaign, and sales region account schema element. We saw how all of these entities 
can be inserted as information while posting the documents. We saw an example 
of activating or just de-activating the unnecessary account schema elements. We 
concluded this section by learning how to avoid the Intercompany journal entries.
In the end, we discussed about avoiding product inventory clearing journal, the 
implementation of commitment accounting, implementing GL Distribution, and 
also a short introduction about product costs, which record all of the financial 
product activities.
In the next chapter, we will experiment with managing inventory activities in 
ADempiere. We will also take a look at material management, especially on product 
attributes, internal use inventory, physical inventory, inventory movement, and 
movement confirmation.

Managing Inventory
So far in this book, you have learnt how to operate ADempiere effectively during 
procurement, sales, and have seen some of the accounting configuration parts. In 
continuing, we need to know how we can manage our inventory.
In your company, your warehouse staff manages the inventory stock, identifies and 
issues material, moves material among locations, handles scrap material, and so on. 
In this chapter, we will show you how ADempiere can help you with these activities. 
We will be discussing the following features:
Product Attributes
Internal Use Inventory
Inventory Movements
Physical Inventory
By understanding these topics, in the end, your warehouse staff will have sufficient 
knowledge to manage their inventory. In addition, your accounting staff or 
accountant will be aware of the accounting impact of these activities (if applicable).
Introducing Product Attributes
Upon receiving material from your vendor (for example, S Fabric), your warehouse 
staff may need information that has a direct relation with his or her job such as:
What is the fabric's color?
What is the fabric's pattern?
Is there any serial number identification available (a unique identity from 
your vendor) in each of the fabric rolls received?
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Managing Inventory
[ 262 ]
All of this available information can help your warehouse staff to identify a material. 
It is really important to keep, let's say, a serial number or any other identity that 
comes from your vendor. If we need to send a material replacement request (due 
to the unacceptable quality of material, different fabric pattern, and so on), we can 
make a reference to this serial number as an identity when communicating with our 
vendors or suppliers.
For our internal warehouse references, with the various materials available in the 
warehouse, we need to think of how to identify our material. It will help us if we can 
identify these materials by our own codification standards and can find, track, and 
get the latest status of these materials as fast as possible, when required.
On the other hand, for our Shirt finished goods, which we need to ship to our 
customer, we need to set up unique information for our reference.
The question is how will ADempiere help us manage the task of including this 
additional information into our products?
ADempiere can manage these requirements and can address them through the 
availability of the Product Attributes feature.
When using this feature, you need to create an attribute set. Each attribute set 
can include:
A "non-instance" attribute—a static product attribute (such as the Shirt's 
color and size) that can be set up when registering (creating) the product 
in the Product window.
An "instance" attribute—additional information or attributes, which could be 
set up when receiving raw materials or shipping finished goods. Information 
such as vendor serial number, additional notes, and so on are available at this 
point of time.
Each unique instance of a product in your current inventory is known as "Attribute 
Set Instance" in ADempiere.
When you do not want to track each unique instance of your inventory 
(that is, you do not define any instance attributes), a special Attribute 
Set Instance (known as the "Standard Attribute Set Instance") is used 
for the products.

Chapter 8
[ 263 ]
Attributes for a raw material's product
We will practice setting up the product attributes for a raw material that has the 
following details:
Color: It has two colors—red and white
Serial Number: Saves the serial number information from vendors
Lot Number: Generates a number for internal references
Description: Saves any additional information that needs to be entered
This information should be used to identify both the instance and non-instance 
product attributes. Now, log in with user ID admin using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd 
Admin as the role, Shirt as the organization, and 1st Shirt W/h as your Warehouse.
We will now guide you through how to set up a color, vendor serial number, lot 
number, description attributes, and bind these attributes to a product.
Registering color attribute configuration
In our example, we can register the Red and White color attributes using the 
Attribute window. Open your Menu | Material Management | Product Attributes 
| Attribute window. This window contains two tabs: Attribute and Attribute Value. 
In the Attribute tab, you can set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Color (R-W).
3.	 Set the Attribute Value Type field to List.
4.	 Deselect both the Mandatory and Instance Attribute checkboxes.
Leave the other fields unchanged. With this information, we are setting up a non-
instance type of attribute.
After saving this information, while using List as Attribute Value Type, you need 
to register your own list (in this case, Red and White). Go to the Attribute Value tab, 
and set the following information:

Registering the vendor serial number configuration
Next, we need to enter the vendor unique ID or serial number into our products. As 
we do not know exactly what information is provided until we perform the material 
receipt, we will set this attribute as an instance attribute.
In the Attribute tab, you can set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Vendor Serial Number/Id.
3.	 Set the Attribute Value Type field to String (max 40).
4.	 Deselect the Mandatory checkbox.
5.	 Select the Instance Attribute checkbox.
Leave the other fields unchanged.
When defining the Attribute Value Type, we have the option to define it as:
List, 
String (max 40)
Numeric
You need to define the Attribute Value if you are using the List type of 
data. Later, this list value will be used as an option to enter information. 
Otherwise, there is no need to set up the Attribute Value.
•
•
•
Registering additional information (description)
You might need to register additional short information when receiving your 
material, which can help to easily identify this material. As this information 
should be available on receiving the material, we will set this configuration 
as instance attributes.
Go to the Attribute tab, and set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Description.
3.	 Set the Attribute Value Type field to String (max 40). With this option, you 
can enter any characters to define information, with a maximum length 40.
4.	 Deselect the Mandatory checkbox.
5.	 Select the Instance Attribute checkbox.
Leave the other fields unchanged.

Chapter 8
[ 265 ]
Registering internal number references (lot number)
ADempiere can help identify products in your warehouse by using Lot Control. 
This feature can help you separate one set of balance identities from the other 
balance identities of the same products. We can define this identity manually or 
let the system automatically generate a number for us. As the last option is a better 
alternative for our purpose, we can utilize the Menu | Material Management | 
Product Attributes | Lot Control window.
Upon opening this window, we see that it contains two tabs: the Lot Control 
and Exclude tabs. In the Lot Control tab, you can specify and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Internal lot numbering.
3.	 You can specify any value for Start Number. The default value is 100.
4.	 Set the Increment field to 1.
5.	 The Current Next value is the same value as the Start Number value.
6.	 You can specify the Prefix and Suffix information if required. In our case, it 
will be a blank value.
For our examples throughout this chapter, there is no need to set up any information 
on the Exclude tab.
Binding raw material attributes into an Attribute Set
Previously, we created a list of attributes that we need to bind into our raw material 
product. Prior to binding these attributes to our raw material, we need to register 
our previous attributes as a single Attribute Set. This Attribute Set will then be 
bound to our product.
Open the Menu | Material Management | Product Attributes | Attribute Set 
window. This window contains three tabs: Attribute Set, Attribute Use, and 
Exclude. In the Attribute Set tab, you can set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Attribute for raw material.
3.	 Select the Lot checkbox.
4.	 Select the Mandatory Lot checkbox.
5.	 Set the Lot Control field to Internal lot numbering (pick from the options).
6.	 Set the Mandatory Type field to Always Mandatory.

After saving this data, the Instance Attribute checkbox will be selected 
automatically, as shown in the following screenshot:
Now, navigate to the Attribute Use tab. We need to register our:

Example of using raw material product 
attributes
To understand the exact impact of defining product attributes (as our previous 
configurations are applicable to our sample raw material), we need to create a  
purchase order and record material receipt.
Creating a new Purchase Order using a material 
that uses attributes
You can create a Purchase Order document as was done previously. There is 
no special or additional activity required during the creation of a Purchase 
Order document that uses a material that uses attributes.
Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Purchase Order window. In the 
Purchase Order tab, enter the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Target Document Type field to Purchase Order.
3.	 Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited.
4.	 Set the Price List field to Purchase PL.

Entering attribute information during Material 
Receipt
On receiving a material, our warehouse staff has information such as the vendor 
serial number available to them. We can also define our internal lot number and 
set an extra description if needed.

Chapter 8
[ 269 ]
Now, open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Material Receipt window. In the 
Material Receipt tab, set the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Document Type field to MM Receipt.
3.	 Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited.
After saving this information, and while we have information on the related 
Purchase Order, we can copy the information from the purchase order line by 
clicking on the Create lines from button. In the upcoming window, pay attention to 
the Purchase Order field. Select our previously-created Purchase Order document, 
and then select both of the raw materials, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the OK button to copy the Purchase Order records to our Material 
Receipt document.
The important point to note when entering our Material Receipt 
document is that we need to define the attribute information. If you forget 
to set the attribute information, then when completing this document, you 
will get an Attribute Set Mandatory (Line No #10, Product= PA Fabric 
Red) error message, as we have set our Mandatory Type to Always 
Mandatory in our Attribute for raw material attribute set.
Go to the Receipt Line tab. Find a line with PA Fabric Red as the Product. You need 
to click on a button inside the Attribute Set Instance field, and it will show a window. 
In this window, we can enter the Vendor Serial Number/Id and Description.

Managing Inventory
[ 270 ]
The Lot No will be used for our internal reference. To generate a lot sequence 
number, all you need to do is click on the New Record button on the right-hand side 
of the Lot field. Finalize this procedure by clicking on the OK button, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
You need to perform the same procedure to define an Attribute Set Instance for 
your second product, PA Fabric White.
If a document is not yet completed, then you are able to edit any 
information in the Attribute Set Instance. Just click on the button in 
the Attribute Set Instance field, and alter the information.
After entering the Attribute Set Instance for both of our products, you can complete 
this document.
Tracking raw material related information 
using its attribute information
After completing a document that has specific information in an Attribute Set 
Instance for the products, you can access related information (such as vendor 
serial number and lot number) and track your products using the Attribute Set 
Instance window.
Tracking using the Attribute Set Instance window
For this example, you can access your product in a previous MM Receipt 
document that contains the Attribute Set Instance information, by opening 
the Menu | Material Management | Attribute Set Instance window.

Chapter 8
[ 271 ]
This window contains four default tabs: Instance, Shipment, Receipt, Movement, 
and Invoice. Within this window, if you select a product's attribute set instance, you 
can access the receipt, movement, and invoice related information for this product's 
attribute set instance. An example of the data taken from the Instance tab is shown 
in the following screenshot:
In the previous screenshot, a small set of records has been shown. In a real production 
environment, the list might contain thousands or even millions of records.
In case you need to search your specific attribute set instance products records, then 
you can click on the Lookup Record button that shows a search dialog window, and 
enter the information in the Description field, or use the Advanced tab to fulfill your 
searching criteria.
Defining additional search criteria
The Lookup Record just performs a search using only the Description 
field. Shouldn't a system be able to also search using the Lot No or 
Serial No information?
Yes, you can find an Attribute Set Instance record based on the Lot No and also 
the Serial No information. You can define additional search criteria by accessing 
the ADempiere System client.

In the Instance tab of the Attribute Set Instance window, search on Record Info 
by clicking on the bottom right-hand side of its window. This will display the table 
name used by this tab (in this case, it shows the M_AttributeSetInstance table).
Log in to System, and set the role to System Administrator. Then open the 
Menu | Application Dictionary | Table and Column window. Find the 
M_AttributeSetInstance table by specifying this table name in the DB Table 
Name field in Lookup Record (search dialog window), as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Click on the OK button. Now, ensure that you have an active record with 
M_AttributeSetInstance in the DB Table Name column. With this record, navigate to 
the Column tab. Find both, the Lot No and Serial No value in the Name field. In both 
of these records, click on the Grid Toggle button to show the detailed information for 
this column. Find and select the Selection Column attribute checkbox.
After completing this procedure, you can log off and log in with user ID admin 
using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role. Open the Menu | Material

button. Now, the search dialog window will also provide the ability to search via 
the Lot No and Serial No fields.
Attributes for Shirt finished goods products
Basically, there are no differences when defining an attribute for both your raw 
materials and Shirt finished goods. It just depends on your decision on how to 
map all of the attributes needed for your specific products.

Chapter 8
[ 273 ]
For our example, we will define a special attribute for our Shirt finished goods, and it 
will have at least:
Size and color
Lot number to identify the production number
Serial Number to identify the shipment identity
Description
With the requirements listed, we will now create the size, lot, and serial number 
attributes. By re-using the existing color and description attributes, we will bind 
all of these attributes into a new attribute set, and attach this attribute set into 
your product.
Registering size attribute configuration
For the Shirt finished goods, the size and color attribute is a common requirement. 
For example, when you go shopping and want to buy a shirt, you could choose a 
color and size that suits your needs. It could be a Large size and White in color.
Because we already have a color attribute, we only need to create the size attribute. 
Open the Menu | Material Management | Product Attributes | Attribute window. 
In the Attribute tab, set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Size (S-M-L).
3.	 Set the Attribute Value Type field to List.
4.	
Deselect both, the Mandatory and Instance Attribute checkboxes.
After saving this information, go to the Attribute Value tab, and set the 
following information:

Registering a lot number to identify production 
identity
If massive production begins, you should be able to identify your production 
identity in your products. This identity will be helpful while tracking the production 
history. Here, we can use a lot number for this purpose.
As mentioned previously in the Registering internal number references (lot number) 
section, access the Menu | Material Management | Product Attributes | Lot Control 
window. Create a new record, and then set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Production Lot Number.
3.	 Set the Prefix field to PLN-.
Leave the other fields unchanged.
Registering the internal number for shipment 
references
We can use the serial number option for our own and customer references, for 
finished goods, during the shipment activities. For our example, we need to set up 
a serial number and configure its attributes in the Menu | Material Management | 
Product Attributes | Serial No Control window. This window will contain two tabs: 
Serial No Control and Exclude.
Within the Serial No Control tab, set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Shipment Serial Number.
3.	 Set the Start No field to 10000 (it has 100 as a default value).
4.	 Set the Increment field to 1.
5.	 Set the Current Next field to 10000.
7.	 Set the Prefix field to SIN- (SIN stands for Shipment Identity Number).
With this configuration, the number generated will be SIN-10000, SIN-10001, 
SIN-10002, and so on.
As we already have a Description attribute, in our case, there is no need to set up 
another description attribute here.

Chapter 8
[ 275 ]
Creating an Attribute Set for the Shirt product
We need to create an Attribute Set that will be used with our finished goods product. 
We need to combine our previously-created attributes into another new Attribute Set. 
This Attribute Set will then be set to our finished goods product.
Open the Menu | Material Management | Product Attributes | Attribute Set 
window. In the Attribute Set tab, set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Attribute for finished goods products.
3.	 Select the Lot checkbox.
4.	 Set the Lot Control field to Production Lot Number.
5.	 Select the Serial No checkbox.
6.	 Set the Serial No Control field to Shipment Serial Number (pick from option).
7.	 Set the Mandatory Type field to Always Mandatory.
On saving this data, the Instance Attribute checkbox will be automatically selected.
Now, navigate to the Attribute Use tab. We need to register our:
Size attribute
Color attribute
Description attribute
Set and save the following information:

Attaching an attribute set to finished 
goods products
We can create a new finished goods product and attach the attribute set that 
we have just created to it. For simplicity, we will just attach our Attribute 
for finished goods products to our existing finished goods product, Shirt 
Finished Goods.
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product 
window. Click on Lookup Record, and find your Shirt Finished Goods product by 
entering Shirt% in the Name field and then clicking on the OK button. In this record, 
enter the following information:
1.	 Set the Attribute Set field to Attribute for finished goods products 
(pick from the option list).
2.	 Click on the button inside the Attribute Set Instance field, and it will show 
a confirmation window. Set the Size as Medium and the color as White, 
and then click on the Save button.
If you get a message such as No Product Attribute Set defined when you click in the 
Attribute Set Instance field, you need to click on the Save button after first setting 
the Attribute Set info. Then you will be able to set the information in the Attribute 
Set Instance field.
On being successfully set up, your record will have an attribute, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 8
[ 277 ]
Example of using product attributes on the 
Shirt finished goods product
Setting our attributes to our finished goods product should be done during the 
Production and Shipment (Customer) processes.
Attaching attributes during production activities
We will now create a new Production activity and set the "attribute set instance". 
Open the Menu | Material Management | Production window. In the Production 
Header tab, set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Name field to Manufacture Shirt FG #4.

Click on the New Record button to generate the Lot No automatically.
Right now, there is no need to set a Serial No. Click on the OK button, and then 
proceed by clicking on the Save button on the Production Line tab.
Navigate back to Production Plan tab, and select your next record. Navigate to 
the Production Line tab, find the Shirt Finished Goods product, and set the 
product's attribute set instance. 

Chapter 8
[ 279 ]
Now, navigate to the Production Header tab, and then finalize the task by clicking 
on the Create/Post Production button once again. Finally click on the OK button in 
the upcoming confirmation window.
You are free to open the Menu | Material Management | Attribute Set Instance 
window, and check that your newly-created records are available in the Instance tab.
Searching for the Shirt product by its attributes
Now, we can access the Product Info for searching purposes. To access the Product 
Info, from the main menu you can point your mouse to View | Product Info, or just 
press Alt + I, as shown in the following screenshot:
In the Product Info window, make sure that you set your Pricelist Version field 
to blank and the Warehouse field to 1st Shirt W/h. In the top right-hand side of 
this window, you will see a Product Attribute Info button, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
When you click on this button, you will be prompted with the Product Attribute 
Info confirmation window. In the Size (S-M-L) field, you can set the value 
as Medium, and click on the OK button. This will show data, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Managing Inventory
[ 280 ]
Previously, we have performed two production activities, with a quantity of 2 
(production line 1) and a quantity of 3 (production line 2), for production batch 
#4. Here, using this information, why can I not see the break down and attribute 
information?
Using this record (with a Name field value of Shirt Finished Goods and an 
Available field value 5.0), click on the second Product Attributes button (as shown 
in the previous screenshot). It will show you the detailed attributes and the detailed 
quantity break down information.
Assigning information during shipment activities
The next important point is assigning an identity to your products during shipment 
activities. For example, this information can be used for the after sales process or 
providing product support such as warranty claims.
Prior to the shipment activities, we need to prepare the Sales Order document. In 
the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice | Sales Orders | Sales Order window, set and save 
the following information in the Order tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Target Document Type field to Standard Order.
3.	 Set the Business Partner field to Standard (Yes, Standard. Actually, you 
could setup any type of business partner).
4.	 Set the Price List to Sales PL.
Leave the other fields unchanged. Navigate to the Order Line tab, and then set and 
save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to Shirt Finished Goods.
2.	 Set the Quantity to 3.
Leave the other fields unchanged. Go back to the Order tab, and click on the 
Complete button to complete this document.
Next, we can generate the Shipment document by using Menu | Quote-to-Invoice 
| Shipments | Generate Shipments. In the upcoming confirmation window, set the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Business Partner field to Standard.
2.	 Set the Document Action field to Prepare.
Finalize this task by clicking on the OK button. Note down the generated 
Shipment number.

Chapter 8
[ 281 ]
Now, you can open your shipment document through the Menu | Quote-to-Invoice 
| Shipments | Shipment (Customer) window. Open the target shipment document. 
Navigate to the Shipment Line tab, and you will have one record. Here, you can set 
a shipment identity number by using the following procedure:
1.	 Click on the button in the Attribute Set Instance field.
2.	 In upcoming window, set the Description and Serial No, and click on the 
OK button. For an example, refer to the following screenshot:
After saving this record in the Shipment Line tab, navigate to the Shipment tab, 
print out this document (it should contain an identity (Serial No) in its description). 
Now, you will be able to complete this document.
Managing internal use of inventory
Sometimes, our company organizes exhibitions to show off our finished goods 
products and our raw materials to our prospective customers or even to the 
public. In such exhibitions, the company takes a small amount of our existing raw 
material. As it takes the pieces of raw material from our warehouses, could we book 
this type of transaction as our advertising and/or promotion costs?
Another example that can be considered is where you have broken or damaged 
inventory—you would also need to book this transaction. This is just an example 
of the cases that are handled by warehouse staff, which could be solved by using 
the Internal Use Inventory feature. You can use this feature by accessing the Menu 
| Material Management | Internal Use Inventory window. This window contains 
two tabs: Internal Use and Internal Use Line.

Managing Inventory
[ 282 ]
In manual activities, the warehouse staff simply takes a piece of material or product 
out of the warehouse and notes this activity in their log book. At the end of the 
accounting period, they summarize all of the transactions related to material 
consumption, create a report, and send it to all of the concerned departments in the 
company (including the accounting department). Using this report, the accounting 
staff can follow up on this transaction. They can book this transaction and create a 
cost allocation to compensate for the material reduced.
When using Internal Use Inventory, we will map a cost allocation using the 
ADempiere Charge. The warehouse staff just picks a Charge option and does 
not care about what accounting parts are related to this. Behind the scenes, upon 
completing and posting this document, this transaction will instruct the system 
to reduce the material and increase the cost.
To support our upcoming sample transaction, we need to create the advertising 
and promotion charges.
Creating advertising and promotion types 
of charge
As you know, we can create a new Charge directly by using the Menu | 
Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Generate Charges form. In the 
upcoming form, perform the following tasks:
1.	 Find and select the 62800 – Other Advertising & Promotion account in the 
Create Charge from Account area.
2.	 Click on the Create from Account button. With the upcoming Charge 
created confirmation window, now you have a new Charge in your system.
Check your newly-created charge in the Menu | Performance Analysis | 
Accounting Rules | Charge window.
Sample usage of Internal Use inventory
We will practice with our S Fabric raw material. In your Internal Use Inventory 
window, ensure that you are now on the Internal Use tab. Set and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Warehouse field to 1st Shirt W/h.
3.	 Set the Movement Date field to today.
4.	 Set the Document Type field to Physical Inventory.

Chapter 8
[ 283 ]
Navigate to the Internal Use Line tab, and then set and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Locator field to Loc S1A.
2.	 Set the Product field to S Fabric.
3.	 Set the Internal Use Qty field to 10.
4.	 Set the Charge field to Other Advertising & Promotion (select from 
the options).
There is no Unit of Measurement (UOM) information here. The system 
will use the default UOM, which is configured in the Product window.
Go back to the Internal Use tab, and complete this document. 
Accounting facts
From the accounting perspective, the default accounting facts/GL journal entry has 
the following format:
Window
Document
Sign
Description
Posting Type
Internal Use 
Inventory
Physical 
Inventory
Db
Charge
Actual
Cr
Product Asset
    Actual
Check the posting status of this document; it will show you a Non Posted status. 
Wait for a moment, and then refresh this document by pressing the F5 key or 
by clicking on the ReQuery button. With this activity, the system will read the 
latest status of the document. Behind the scenes, the accounting processor should, 
periodically, post this document automatically for us.
Assuming that this document has already been posted by the system, the accounting 
staff or accountant can click on the Posted button, and the accounting facts/GL 
journal entries generated by the system should be as follows:

Managing Inventory
[ 284 ]
This journal amount comes from the product cost of S Fabric. Access 
the Menu | Performance Analysis | Costing | Product Costs 
window, and you will find that both Average Cost (3.80) and Freight 
allocation cost (1.3669) belong to S Fabric. Multiply both of these 
costs by the material consumption (10), and you will get 51.67.
Tracking inventory transactions
After issuing the material, the warehouse staff can check to ensure that the system 
has been cleaned out of the material from the warehouses. ADempiere provides a 
Menu | Material Management | Material Transactions form to check or monitor 
inventory activities.
For your reference, we will monitor our S Fabric inventory activities. Open the 
Material Transactions form, and set the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Locator field to Loc S1A.
3.	 Set the Product field to S Fabric.
4.	 Click on the ReQuery button.
As a result, the system should give you information similar to what is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 8
[ 285 ]
During examining a movement quantity, you should also be aware of the Movement 
Type information. The meaning of the information in the Movement Type field is 
as follows:
Vendor Receipts means that we are receiving a material from your vendor, 
and as we have a positive value in the movement quantity, it will increase 
your stock
Production tells us that this material is used during production activities, 
and it reduces your stock
The Inventory Out is a transaction taken from our Internal Use Inventory, 
and it reduces your stock
Managing Physical Inventory
In an effort to start an ADempiere implementation in the company, your warehouse 
manager might think of:
How to perform stock counting. This is important to know what is the latest 
outstanding balance status of our material. With this information, we can 
perform stock reconciliation between system and actual stock.
Whether there is any difference between system and actual stock levels, and 
how to book this variance in the system.
A way to migrate our existing raw material records into ADempiere.
These are just a couple of issues that might occur during the implementation of a 
new system such as ADempiere in your company.
Fortunately, ADempiere can help us to resolve these issues by using its Physical 
Inventory feature. We will go through the process of how to resolve these issues 
in detail in the following sections.
Stock counting and reconciliation
At the end of a month (or at the end of an accounting period), a company may have 
a procedure to check their stock of goods to ensure that their physical stock is equal 
to the quantity recorded in their system. We will map this activity through the 
Menu | Material Management | Physical Inventory window.

In the following activity, we shall see an example on how to perform stock counting 
in the Shirt organization, especially in the 1st Shirt W/h, which is targeted only at raw 
material. In the Inventory Count tab, you can set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Description field to End of month stock counting & reconciliation.
3.	 Set the Warehouse field to 1st Shirt W/h.
4.	 Set the Movement field to today's date.
5.	 Set the Document Type field to Physical Inventory.
Then, click on the Create Inventory Count List button. In the upcoming confirmation 
window, you can set the following information:
1.	 Set the Locator field to Loc S1A.
2.	 Set the Product Category field to Raw Material.
Leave the other fields unchanged, and then click on the OK button. Internally, 
the system will count the stock based on our selection criteria, and the results can 
be accessed in the Inventory Count Line tab. The results should be similar to the 
following screenshot: 
Pay attention on the S Fabric record. In the author's installation, as per the system, it 
has a book quantity of 57.87 (quantity in the system). You can check the result of the 
balance quantity by examining the list of S Fabric movement activities through the 
Menu | Material Management | Material Transactions form.

Chapter 8
[ 287 ]
If you were informed by your warehouse staff that the actual quantity remaining is 
only 57, based on this information, you could update the 57.87 quantity count to 57, 
by using the following procedure:
1.	 Navigate to an S Fabric active record, and click on the Grid Toggle button, 
in order to show detailed information for S Fabric.
2.	 Update the Quantity count field to 57, and click on the Save button.
Examine the Inventory Type field in the Inventory Count Line tab. The available 
options are:
Inventory Difference
Charge Account
By default, the system will use Inventory Difference.
Make Inventory Count your active tab, and complete the document. Now, you can 
check your Material Transactions form again to get the latest S Fabric material 
movement activities. 
Accounting facts
What is the difference between Inventory Difference and Charge Account then?
From an accounting perspective, we can use this inventory type as an alternative 
that can be used to map a cost allocation. When we use Inventory Difference, the 
system automatically uses Warehouse differences as the default account, which 
is configured in the Defaults tab of the Accounting Schema window, which is 
56100 – Inventory Shrinkage.
If you are using Charge Account, then you can define a target Charge, such as the 
one mentioned previously in the Managing internal use of inventory sections. Here, 
you will get the exact same results or behavior while using Charge.

Because the accounting processor runs behind the scenes, the system will 
automatically post this document for you. Wait a moment, and press the F5 key, or 
click on the ReQuery button, until you see a Posted status for the document. As the 
quantity count value is below that of the quantity book, the following screenshot 
shows the accounting facts/GL journal entries generated:
The 4.50 value is derived from:
((Original Quantity count – New Quantity count) * S Fabric product costs)
=
( (57.87 – 57) * (3.8 + 1.3669) )
If your new quantity count value is more than the original one 
(quantity count greater than quantity book), then the accounting 
facts/GL journal generated is an opposite format to the one shown 
in the previous screenshot.
Migrating an existing raw material into 
ADempiere
Another example of utilizing the Physical Inventory feature is when you migrate 
your existing raw material into ADempiere:
Before performing the migration activities, the commonly-available information is:
Description of raw material
Quantity and its unit of measurement
Price or latest material valuation
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 289 ]
With this information, we can perform the data migration. The following is a list of 
tasks that need to be done:
Create a Product Category for the material, and set the Costing Method to 
Standard Costing.
Create a Product.
Set the product cost for this product.
Enter your raw material quantity in the Physical Inventory window.
Let say, we have data as listed in the following table:
Description
UOM
Qty
Valuation
Hang Tag
Pieces
100
0.2
Carton Box
Pieces
150
1.2
With this sample outstanding raw material, we will manually enter the Hang Tag 
data into our ADempiere environment.
Creating a migration product category
We need to identify a special product category to differentiate from the 
available product category. For our example, we can create a Migration 
RM product category.
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | 
Product Category window. In the Product Category tab, set and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to Migration RM.
Leave the other fields unchanged.
Navigate to the Accounting tab, and then set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Costing Method field to Standard Costing.
2.	 Set the Costing Level field to Client.
The process is now complete. Next, we need to create a new product.

Creating a migration product
As per our requirement, we shall create the Hang Tag product, using Migration RM 
as its product category.
Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | Product 
window. In the Product tab, set the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to Hang Tag.
3.	 Set the Product Category field to Migration RM.
4.	 Set the Tax Category field to Standard.
5.	 Set the UOM field to Piece.
6.	 Set the Product Type field to Item.
7.	 Set the Locator field to S1A.
8.	 Deselect both the Purchase and Sold checkboxes.
Furthermore, we need to create a product cost.
Setting a product's product costs
As we are using Standard Costing as a costing method, we need to enter the latest 
material valuation, and set this amount or value as its product cost.
Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Costing | Product Costs window. On 
the Select Product tab, ensure that Hang Tag is your active record. Navigate to the 
Product Costs tab. In this tab, there is a product cost record with Standard Costing 
as its Cost Element (if you cannot find this record, then you can add this record by 
yourself). You need to update the Current Cost Price field to 0.2, as shown in the 
following screenshot: 

Chapter 8
[ 291 ]
Here, we have not set the currency information. The currency 
used for this record is taken from the default currency for the 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd UN/34 US Dollar accounting schema.
Performing migration activities
With the existing data and the preparation of the product category, product, and the 
set up of the products costs, we can create a migration transaction through the Menu 
| Material Management | Physical Inventory window. Open this window, and in 
the Inventory Count tab, you can set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Description field to Import legacy Raw Material data.
3.	 Set the Warehouse field to 1st Shirt W/h.
4.	 Set the Movement field to today.
5.	 Set the Document Type field to Physical Inventory.
Navigate to the Inventory Count Line tab, and then set and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Locator field to S1A (actually, you can define your own locator, 
which will be identified as the migration location).
3.	 Set the Product field to Hang Tag.
4.	 Set the Quantity Count field to 100.
5.	 Set the Inventory Type field to Inventory Difference.
If you need to set another target account despite having an 
Inventory Difference, then in the Inventory Type field, you can 
set the value as Charge Account. If you choose this type, then there 
will be a Charge field that can be set up.
Here, we are only entering the information related to Hang Tag. In a real-life 
scenario, you could enter all of your company's materials in this tab. Navigate 
back to the Inventory Count tab, and complete this document.

Accounting facts
There is no significant difference between the general journal format created here 
and the previous stock counting activities. The only difference is in the journal 
position. In this activity, we can make an assumption that the count quantity is 
greater than the book quantity.
Wait for a moment, and then press the F5 key or click on the ReQuery button, until 
the document shows a Posted status. An accounting facts/GL journal is generated, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
Moving Inventory
Moving the Inventory is a common task when managing our raw materials in 
a warehouse. In their daily activities, your warehouse staff might perform the 
following activities:
Moving material between locations in different warehouses and 
different organizations
Moving material between locations in different warehouses but in the 
same organization
Moving material between locations in the warehouse
In these activities, if your warehouse staff is sending the material outside of the 
warehouse or location, the recipient (at the target warehouse) should record a 
confirmation when receiving the material.
ADempiere can help you manage these issues. You can use the Menu | Material 
Management | Inventory Move window to perform such an inventory movement. 
This window contains three tabs: Move, Move Line, and Attributes, and it should 
contain one document type to work on, that is, Material Movement.
We will use an example to practice all types of inventory movement and examine 
the generated accounting facts/GL journal entries.

Movement between locations in different 
warehouses and / or different organizations
We will use our S Label raw material in our example. Currently, the S Label 
material resides in the Loc S1A location. This location is in the 1st Shirt W/h in the 
Shirt organization. We will move a small quantity of the S Label material to Loc 
D2B, which is in the 1st Dress W/h in the Dress organization. The following is a

Setting up the In-Transit Material Movement 
document
When performing an inventory move between locations and between warehouses, 
we usually need a confirmation from the people who receive the material. As per 
the standard configuration, ADempiere does not have the In-Transit Material 
Movement document.
We need to prepare this document type to accomplish our needs. You can open the 
Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Document Type window. 
Find the Material Movement document type by entering Material Move% in the 
Name field of the Lookup Record (search dialog) window. We need to copy this 
document type, and then alter some configuration. 

Managing Inventory
[ 294 ]
Use the following procedure:
1.	 Press Shift + F2 to create a new copy of the document type from the existing 
Material Move document type.
2.	  Change the Name field to In-Transit Material Movement.
3.	  Select the In Transit checkbox.
4.	 Save your record.
Leave the other fields unchanged. Save the record, and you will get a new document 
type, as shown in the following screenshot:
To ensure that our ADempiere client system will read our new configuration, you 
need to close all active ADempiere windows and reset the cache information by 
executing the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Cache Reset process.

Practising Moving Inventory with confirmation 
Now, your warehouse staff, who have the authority for Loc S1A, should prepare 
a transaction through the Inventory Move window. In the Move tab, set and save 
the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Movement Date field to today.
3.	 Set the Document Type field to In-Transit Material Movement (now, you 
have two options for the document type).
Navigate to the Move Line tab, and then set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Label.
2.	 Set the Locator field to Loc S1A (this is source location).
3.	 Set the Locator To field to Loc D2B (this is target location).
4.	 Set the Movement Quantity field to 100.
If your product has attribute instance info, then you also 
need to set up the Attribute Set Instance and Attribute Set 
Instance To information.
Navigate back to the Move tab, and complete this document. Your document 
should now have an In Progress document status. Check your Material 
Transactions window related to the raw material. Currently, this transaction 
does not appear in this window.
Confirming receipt of full material quantity 
With the In-Transit Material Movement document type, ADempiere will 
automatically create a Move Confirmation document. Imagine that you are now 
acting as a warehouse person who has authority in the Loc D2B location of the 2nd 
Dress W/h warehouse (the recipient), and you need to check the physical material 
that you have received, prior to creating a confirmation.

Managing Inventory
[ 296 ]
Suppose that you receive the same quantity, and that there is no broken material. 
You can make a confirmation by opening the Menu | Material Management | 
Move Confirmation window. Find the document, and examine the Line tab of 
the document, as shown in the following screenshot:
Okay, there is no variance in the quantity, and there is no broken material received. 
In such cases, the recipient needs to complete the Move Confirmation document in 
the Confirmation tab.
Upon this confirmation, the sender will be able to complete his or her In-Transit 
Material Movement document.
Accounting facts
As an accounting staff member or an accountant, you can examine the generated 
accounting facts/GL journal entries. The standard journal format generated is:
Window

Description
Posting Type
Locator
Inventory 
Move
In-Transit 
Material

Wait for a moment, and then press the F5 key, or click on the ReQuery button, until 
the document has a Posted status. Now, examine the accounting facts/GL journal 
entries created for this transaction. We need to get more information related to the 
generated accounting facts/GL journal entries. In the Account Viewer window, 
select the Enter Query tab, select the Display Document Info, Display Source 
Info, and Display Quantity checkboxes, and then click on the ReQuery button. 
The output is shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
[ 297 ]
When comparing this with the results in your Account Viewer window, 
this screenshot will not look similar to your Account Viewer window. 
The fields have been rearranged in the screenshot (the Product and 
Quantity fields have been dragged and dropped onto the left-hand side 
of the Currency field).
Unfortunately, there is no Locator field information shown here. If you need the 
complete accounting facts/GL journal entries generated, then you need to access 
the information in the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Fact Details 
window. Find the latest records in this window, and you (as the accounting staff 
or accountant) will get the complete journal information.
Confirmation of receiving with scrapped material
During the process of transferring material, anything could happen. The material 
could break or, in the worst scenario, could be lost. If the warehouse staff 
(the recipient) receives broken material, he or she can create a confirmation 
by entering a scrapped quantity.
Create a new In-Transit Material Movement document, and set the same 
information mentioned in the Practicing Moving Inventory with confirmation section. 
These activities should be done by the sender. 
Suppose you have five pieces of the S Label broken, in the Line tab of the Move 
Confirmation window, the target warehouse staff (the recipient) needs to enter 
the information mentioned as follows:
1.	 Set the Confirmed Quantity field to 95.
2.	 Set the Scrapped Quantity field to 5.

Managing Inventory
[ 298 ]
On completing this confirmation document, ADempiere will:
Set a notification in the Description field, as shown in the following screenshot:
Automatically create a Physical Inventory document in the Physical 
Inventory window. This document belongs to organization in the target 
warehouse (using Dress as the Organization and 2nd Dress W/h as 
the Warehouse).
The purpose of this Physical Inventory document is to record the quantity variance. 
The recipient needs to go through this Physical Inventory document and check the 
results of the variance quantity. Furthermore, the recipient should use the Inventory 
Difference or Charge Account for the target Inventory Type.
After completing the confirmation window, the sender needs to complete the 
In-Transit Material Movement, whereas the recipient needs to complete the 
Physical Inventory document previously created.
Confirmation of receiving with partial material
In our next case, if the target warehouse staff (the recipient) receives a partial 
quantity of material, we can create a confirmation by entering the quantity 
material as is.
Create another In-Transit Material Movement document, and set the information 
mentioned in the Practicing Moving Inventory with confirmation sections. These 
activities should be done by the sender.
•

Chapter 8
[ 299 ]
Suppose your target warehouse staff (the recipient) receives 90 pieces of S Label, 
with the assumption that he or she lost 10 pieces of S Label. In the Line tab of the 
Move Confirmation window, he or she needs to enter the information mentioned 
as follows:
1.	 Set the Confirmed Quantity field to 90.
2.	 Set the Scrapped Quantity field to 0. The system will automatically set the 
value 10 in the Difference field.
On completing this confirmation document, ADempiere will automatically create 
a Physical Inventory document, and this document belongs to the organization in 
the source warehouse (using Shirt as the Organization and 1st Shirt W/h as the 
Warehouse), as shown in the following screenshot:
After completing the confirmation window, the sender needs to complete both, 
the In-Transit Material Movement and the Physical Inventory document 
previously created.
Movement among locations in the same 
warehouse
Moving materials among locations within the same warehouse is the simplest of 
tasks for movement activities. Assuming that the target location is within the staff's 
authority, there is usually no need to create a confirmation. All of the material 
transferred will go to the target location without any problem.

Managing Inventory
[ 300 ]
Without confirmation, we can create a movement document by using the Material 
Movement document type instead of the In-Transit Material Movement document.
Let us practice by creating a Material Movement document. Suppose we need 
to transfer the S Label material from Loc D2B to Loc D2A (location in the same 
warehouse). In the Move tab, set and save the following information: 
1.	 Set the Organization field to Dress.
2.	 Set the Movement Date field to today.
3.	 Set the Document Type field to Material Movement 
(Yes, Material Movement).
Navigate to the Move Line tab, and then set and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Label.
2.	 Set the Locator field to Loc D2B (this is the source location).
3.	 Set the Locator To field to Loc D2A (this is the target location).
4.	 Set the Movement Quantity field to 100.
Navigate back to the Move tab, and complete this document. You will now see your 
document showing a Completed status instead of In Progress. With this status, in 
the system, your material has been moved to the new location. You can check your 
movement activities by using the Material Transactions window.
Summary
In this chapter, we have taken a deeper look at how to manage our inventory.
First, we played with the Product Attributes. In the Product Attributes, we could 
set additional information for all of our products. There are two types of attributes: 
non-instance attributes, and instance attributes. A "non-instance" attribute is a 
static product attribute such as the Shirt's color and size, and can be set up while 
registering (creating) the product in the Product window. An instance attribute 
is additional information or an attribute, and can be set up when receiving a 
raw material or when shipping finished goods. We have practiced how to set 
up information for both non-instance and instance attributes.

Chapter 8
[ 301 ]
Then, we continued our discussion on how to book a material consumption for 
internal use (such as consuming material for an exhibition) and how to track this 
material movement using the Material Transactions window.
Later, we showed you how to perform stock counting and how to book any variance 
in quantity between system and physical stock by using the Physical Inventory 
window. The other feature that could be applied using this window is importing 
our legacy products. At the end of this chapter, we practiced inventory movements.
In the upcoming chapter, we will guide you through the concepts and implementation 
of the ADempiere workflow. We will try and explain the concept, configuration parts, 
and how to make the workflow work.


ADempiere Workflow
When creating a purchase requisition document, our company has a rule: 
if the total value reaches some amount, then it requires proper approval 
by management.
In ADempiere, we identify this case as a process that requires a user's decision. 
This is a case that can be implemented with the help of a feature called 
ADempiere Workflow.
In this chapter, we will learn the concept and sample implementation of ADempiere 
Workflow types such as:
General
Document Process
Document Value
We start our discussion by explaining the General type of workflow.
Knowing the General workflow—a 
step-by-step guide
This type of workflow is aimed at providing guidance as well as step-by-step 
instructions to perform a task. This series of activities involves several ADempiere 
windows and/or forms or processes, which involve the user in each of the activities. 
You can access all of the preconfigured general workflow in the ADempiere Menu.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 304 ]
Example of general workflow
One example form of standard general workflow available is Product Setup. Log in 
with user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role and Shirt as 
the organization. Access this workflow by clicking on Menu | Material Management 
| Material Management Rules | Product Setup. As you can see, this workflow is a 
sequential, or step-by-step activity, as shown in the following screenshot:
The activities related to setting up a Product are available in the Workflow tab. We 
need to open, review, and enter any information in the Warehouse & Locators, Unit 
of Measure, Product Category, Tax Category, and Product windows.
You will go to each of these windows one-by-one and perform the necessary activities.
Constructing our own general workflow
How is this type of workflow constructed?
We will practice creating our own general workflow. We will create a short series of 
activities such as Product Category → Unit of Measure → Product. Log in to System 
(with the user ID System and System Administrator as the role). Open the Menu | 
System Admin | General Rules | Workflow | Workflow window, and set and save 
the following information in the Workflow tab:
1.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to Setup Product simplified version.
2.	 Set the Workflow Type field to General.

Chapter 9
[ 305 ]
3.	 Set the Data Access Level field to Client + Organization (select from the 
available options).
4.	 Set the Author field to your name.
Navigate to the Node tab. Here, we need to register a series of activities. 
Enter and save the following information:
Field\Data
1st data
2nd data
3rd data
Search Key
Product Category
Unit of Measure
Product
Name
Product Category
Unit of Measure
Product
Action
User Window
User Window
User Window
Window
Product Category
Unit of Measure
Product
Leave the other fields unchanged.
We need to set the transition among registered windows. Ensure that you have 
Product Category in the Search Key field as the active record, navigate to the 
Transition tab, and then add and save the following information:
5.	 Set the Next Node field to Unit of Measure.
Go back to the Node tab and ensure that you have Unit of Measure in the Search 
Key field as your active record, navigate to the Transition tab, and then add and 
save the following information:
6.	 Set the Next Node field to Product.
Now, navigate back to the Workflow tab, and finalize this configuration by setting 
the Start Node field to Product Category. Save your changes.
This is just an example of building our own general workflow. You can build a 
series of tasks that might be unusual or non-daily tasks, such as a list of reports or 
processes to be carried out at month end or year end.
Attaching general workflow to a menu
Now that the configuration has been done, we need to register our own new general 
workflow to the ADempiere menu, as this will make it accessible to the end-user.
Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | System Rules | Menu 
window. You need to enter and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Name field to Sistematika Setup Product.
2.	 Set the Action field to Workflow.
3.	 Set the Workflow field to Setup Product simplified version.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 306 ]
On the left-hand side of this window, you will see your newly-created menu. You 
can arrange the location of this menu by dragging and dropping it to the place that 
suits your needs.
In the last part of our activity, you need to register this menu to the roles that need 
to be able to access this menu. Log in with user ID admin with Sistematika Fashion, 
Ltd Admin as the role and Shirt as the organization, and then execute the Menu | 
System Admin | General Rules | Security | Role Access Update process. In the 
upcoming window, you should perform the following tasks:
1.	 Set the Client field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd.
2.	 Set the Role field to blank (which means this menu will be accessible to all of 
the available roles).
3.	 Click on the OK button.
We will discuss more detail about Role in the Chapter 12, 
Implementing Security
Re-log in with the user ID admin, and now you can see and access your own 
general workflow.
Understanding ADempiere workflow
Workflow is defined as a step-by-step activity to complete a task that involves both the 
people and the system. As a default, all of the documents in ADempiere (for example, 
Purchase Requisition, Purchase Order, MM Receipt, and so on) are automatically 
workflow-enabled and are easy to extend or modify. Before we extend or modify 
anything, we need to know the details of how ADempiere Workflow works.
Now, log in to System (with the user ID System and System Administrator as 
the role), and open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Workflow | 
Workflow window. This window contains six tabs: Workflow, Access, Node, 
Parameter, Transition, and Condition.
Knowing the workflow for an ADempiere 
document
The basic principle is that, the ADempiere Document Process and Document Value 
workflow will be configured based on table information.

Chapter 9
[ 307 ]
While all of the documents in ADempiere are workflow enabled, how do you know 
the relationship between ADempiere documents, workflow, and table information?
All ADempiere documents (such as, Purchase Order, MM Receipt, AR Receipt, 
and so on) are entered through the relevant window. For example, AR Receipt 
documents will be entered in the Payment window. With this window, through 
its Record Info (refer to the section More on Record Info, in Chapter 2, Exploring the 
ADempiere Client and Performing Tasks), you will know which internal ADempiere 
table is being used to save the information. In this example, the Payment window 
is using the C_Payment table to store its information.
Knowing the table information, you can identify that we can create a workflow 
(both of Document Process or Document Value workflow) for  payment purposes, 
defining C_Payment (C_Payment_Payment in the option) in the Table field, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
As you can see, in this standard preconfigured Process_Payment workflow, 
ADempiere informs us that this Document Process workflow will be enabled if 
there are any activities that involve the C_Payment table, such as completing an 
AR Payment document.
If we have two active Document Process workflows that use the C_Payment 
table in my configuration, then which one will be executed or processed by the 
ADempiere system?
There is some additional configuration taking part in the process of knowing which 
Document Process workflow will be used in our ADempiere implementation.
Let us check the configuration through its internal Application Dictionary. Log in 
to System (with user ID System and System Administrator as the role). Open the 
Menu | Application Dictionary | Table and Column window. In the upcoming 
Lookup Record (search dialog) window, enter C_Payment in the DB Table Name 
field, and click on the OK button.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 308 ]
With the existing information in the Table tab, perform the following tasks:
1.	 Navigate to the Column tab. As per its Record Info, there will be 84 records 
available. Point your active records to the information having DocAction as 
its DB Column Name, as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Check the Process field. It contains C_Payment_Process_Process Payment. 
Right-click on this field, and click on the Zoom button. You will be redirected 
to the Report & Process window that contains C_Payment_Process as its 
Search Key and Process Payment as its Name.
3.	 In the existing Report & Process tab, find the Workflow field. It has been set 
to the Process Payment workflow.
4.	 Right-click on this field, and click on the Zoom button. You will be directed 
to the Workflow window that contains Process_Payment in both the Search 
Key and the Name field

Chapter 9
[ 309 ]
With this information, ADempiere tells us that while you click on the document 
action button (which is the Complete button in the Payment window), ADempiere 
will execute the Process_Payment workflow.
Activity/Node flow
A workflow will contain more than one activity or step. In ADempiere, we will map 
our "activity" as a Node, and should register it in the Node tab.
If you go through all of the preconfigured workflow records in this Workflow 
window, you can divide all of these records into two types of Workflow Types:
Document Process
General
All of the workflow records that have the Process_ prefix in their name are examples 
of the Document Process workflow, whereas workflow records which have the 
Setup prefix in their name are of a General type of workflow.
All of the workflows that have the prefix Process_ in their name (such as 
Process_Requisition, Process_Invoice and so on) have a standard list of 
activity/nodes, as follows:
(Start)
(DocPrepare)
(DocComplete)
(DocAuto)
With the existing Process_Payment workflow, you can check all of these activities or 
nodes, on the Node tab.
Although it has four activities or nodes, actually ADempiere documents use a standard 
flow such as (Start) → (DocPrepare) → (DocComplete). You may check the transition 
value among these activities on the Transition tab for each activity or node.
Setting up transition among Activities/Nodes
When defining a workflow, it will contain a list of activities that need to be processed 
in the correct order. For example, suppose we have the following list of activities 
which needs to be executed in this order:
Start
Processing phase #1
Processing phase #2
End/Complete
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

ADempiere Workflow
[ 310 ]
After registering a series of activities or nodes, the system needs some configuration 
about the sequence of activities to be followed. 
With this sequence of activities, you need to setup the transition between activities or 
nodes in the Transition tab. In the Start activity, we need to set the next transition to 
Processing phase #1. In the Processing phase #1 activity, we can set the next transition 
to Processing phase #2. Finally, the Processing phase #2 activity will have the next 
transition set to End/Complete.
In some circumstances and conditions, we may need to bypass Processing phase #2. 
Thus, the sequence will be, Start → Processing phase #1 → End/Complete. Is this 
sequence possible?
Of course, yes. Upon defining a next transition at the Processing phase #1 activity or 
node, you will define two types of transition as follows:
In the first transition, set the next transition to End/Complete, and specify 
your condition.
In the second transition, set the next transition to Processing phase #2.
There are rules for defining more than one transition in the Transition 
tab. You need to specify the first transition record by entering a specific 
condition or criteria in the Condition tab. Next, enter another transition 
that has a more general condition.
Node's Action
While registering an activity or node for the workflow, in the Node tab, there are 
multiple attributes, as shown in the following screenshot:
One of the types of available attributes is Action. The following is the list of 
available actions:
Wait (Sleep): We can specify a period of time (in minutes) before the system 
proceeds to the next activity or node.
•
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 311 ]
User Choice: This activity or node requires user interaction. The format of 
user choice can be a Yes/No decision or the selection of an option from a list 
of values (depending on the field type).
User Action: This activity or node also requires user interaction. During 
processing of this node, the actions that need to be done are as follows: the 
user will open the Window (User Window) or Form (User Form), perform 
the necessary activities on this Window or Form, and then exit from the 
Window or Form, to complete the activity.
Automatic processes: This type of action will execute any Apps Process, 
Apps Report, Document Action (Approve, Reject, Re-Activate, and so on), Set 
Variable which sets a constant value in the target column, and send an Email. 
Here, there is no user interaction needed to execute this activity or node.
Later, we will show you an example of using Action, when explaining the document 
process in more detail.
Node's workflow responsible
Another attribute available when setting up a node is: Workflow Responsible. As 
indicated by the name itself, we can delegate the responsibility when executing or 
processing this activity or node to the Workflow Responsible.
To know the list of "workflow responsible" available in the system, log in with user ID 
admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and * as the organization. 
Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Workflow | Workflow 
Responsible window. In your ADempiere installation, there will be two default 
records, named Invoker and Organization.
Responsible Type
In relation to with the records available in the Workflow Responsible window, there 
are three types of Responsible Type available during registration of the Workflow 
Responsible. These are as follows:
Human: Invoker is an example of the workflow responsible that is created by 
using the Human responsible type. On registering the workflow responsible 
while using the Human responsible type, you can define the target user in 
the User/Contact field. Without setting up information in the User/Contact 
field, it means the person or user who starts the workflow will become a 
person who is responsible for the activity or node.
•
•
•
•

ADempiere Workflow
[ 312 ]
Organization: When choosing the Organization as a responsibility type, 
this means that the person or user who was registered as a supervisor of 
the current transactional organization will become the person responsible. 
You can set up the supervisor of the organization in the Menu | System 
Admin | Organization Rules | Organization window, and navigate to the 
Organization Info tab. There you will find the Supervisor field.
Role: All the people or users who are associated with this role will become 
responsible for this activity or node.
Setting up a new workflow responsible
As required by our example, we will set up user admin as another instance of the 
Human workflow responsible, and will add two Role types of workflow responsible. 
In the Workflow Responsible window, set and save the following information:
Field\Data
1st data
2nd data
3rd data

Next, we will continue with our discussion of the document process workflow and 
an implementation example of this workflow type.
Document process workflow
As discussed earlier, we need to implement the approval procedure if the requisition 
has reached some value. For our reference, could you show me how to configure this 
approval activity when we have a requisition value of more than US$ 100? 
Because we will work on the Purchase Requisition document, in which we are 
entering the information in the Requisition window, we know that this window 
uses the M_Requisition table for its Record Info. An available preconfigured 
workflow that uses the M_Requisition (shown M_Requisition_Requisition 
in the Table field) table is Process_Requisition.
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 313 ]
Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Workflow | Workflow 
window. Find a Process_Requisition record, and examine the Table field. In this 
record, the Workflow Type field contains Document Process, which indicates that 
we are working with the document process workflow.
We will extend this workflow to accomplish our requisition approval activities. 
Setting up User Choice actions
In this example, we will add a node using the User Choice action. Navigate to the 
Node tab, and then add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to (DocApproval).
3.	 Set the Action field to User Choice.
4.	 Set the Column field to IsApproved. This will show IsApproved_Approved 
in the option.
In this new active record, navigate to the Transition tab, and then add and save the 
following information.
5.	 Set the Next Node field to (DocComplete)
Now, navigate back to the Node tab, and find the (DocPrepare) record, and 
then navigate to the Transition tab again. You have one transition default record, 
with information such as:
A Node field, set to (DocPrepare)
A Next Node field, set to (DocComplete)
A Sequence field, set to 100
You need to enter additional transition records. Add and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Next Node field to (DocApproval).
3.	 Set the Sequence field to 10.
As we will set up a more detailed condition to compare with the 
default transition record, which does not have any condition; you 
must set this sequence number below the sequence number that 
belongs to transition default records (which was 100).
•
•
•

ADempiere Workflow
[ 314 ]
With this new transition record, navigate to the Condition tab, add and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Sequence field to 10.
2.	 Set the And/Or field with Or.
3.	 Set the Column field to TotalLines (shown as TotalLines_Total Lines 
in the option).
Note: TotalLines is a total amount from all of the lines. In this case, it is the 
total amount of all of the requisition lines.
4.	 Set the Operation field to >.
5.	 Set the Value field to 100.
With this additional configuration, we have two standard flows, as follows:
1.	 If the total requisition value is > 100, the document flow will be:
Start → DocPrepare → DocApproval → DocComplete
2.	 If the total requisition value is <= 100, the document flow will be:
Start → DocPrepare → DocComplete
Now, we will see who is responsible for approving a document when the requisition 
value has an amount of more than 100.
Finding the person with approval rights
As per my understanding, if we have a total value of more than 100, the requisition 
needs approval. We have not assigned somebody to handle this approval. The 
question is, who is taking care of the approval processes? 
When configuring the User Choice action and using IsApproved as the column 
value, internally, ADempiere will find the person or user who has approval rights, 
in the following order:
1.	 First, the system will find the supervisor of this user. We can check the 
user's supervisor by opening the Menu | System Admin | General Rules 
| Security | User window. Find the target user in this window. In the User 
Contact tab, you will find the Supervisor field.

Chapter 9
[ 315 ]
2.	 If no supervisor information is specified, then the system tries to find 
the supervisor of the Organization. You can check the organization's 
supervisor by opening the Menu | System Admin | Organization Rules | 
Organization window. Find and locate the organization (which is used in the 
target requisition document), navigate to the Organization Info tab, and then 
check the Supervisor field.
3.	 If no supervisor information is specified, then it will try to get the supervisor 
of the parent organization for this organization. We will get the parent 
organization in the Parent Organization field on the Organization Info tab.
After finding the user, the system will perform the following activity:
1.	 It will find all of the roles associated with this user. You can check this value 
by opening the User window and navigating to the User Roles tab. For 
the roles data itself, open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | 
Security | Role window.
2.	 With those roles, the system tries to check the values in the Approve own 
Documents and Approval Amount fields. If the Approve own Documents 
is selected and the Approval Amount value is greater than the requisition 
value, then this user is eligible to process the document approval.
With this information, open the User window. Find user ID admin, and check the 
available roles associated with this user. In the User Roles tab, it has two roles 
associated: Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin and Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User. 
To support our example further, open the Role window. Set a proper change, and 
ensure that you have the following information:
Field\Role
Sistematika Fashion, 
Ltd Admin

following activities:
1.	 Open the User window, and find the user records. 
2.	 Set the Supervisor field to admin, and save this information.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 316 ]
Sample of approval workflow implementation
As a common company requirement, we will create a purchase requisition document 
that has the user ID user who creates this document.
Initiating a requisition document
We will create a purchase requisition document. Log in with user ID user, role 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User, and organization Shirt. Open the Menu | 
Requisition-to-Invoice | Requisition window. In the Requisition tab, enter 
and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Document Type field to Purchase Requisition.
3.	 Set the Date Required field to today.
4.	 Set the Price List field to Purchase PL.
Navigate to the Requisition Line tab, and then add and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Fabric. After setting up this product, the Price field 
will be populated automatically by the price information taken from the 
Product | Price tab. You are still able to alter this price if necessary. For 
now, keep it as the standard price (3.80).
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 100.
On saving this record, you will get a notice that your total value is 380. Complete 
this document. Instead of having a Completed document status, now the Document 
Status is In Progress.
Because the total value of this requisition document is more than 100, if you try to 
complete this document, the approval document process workflow procedure will 
be executed by the ADempiere system.
Approving the requisition document
With our configuration, user ID admin is a person who is responsible for approving 
this document. Log in with user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin 
as the role and Shirt as the organization. You can perform the approval by 
opening the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Workflow | Workflow 
Activities window.

Chapter 9
[ 317 ]
This window will contain all of the to-do lists or activity lists that need attention 
from this user. With the previous requisition processes, this window will now 
have information similar to that shown in the following screenshot:
Before making a decision about this document, you should be able to access the 
original document by clicking on the Zoom button (1). If everything is OK, in the 
Answer field (2), you can select the Yes value, set some description in the Messages 
field, and then click on the OK button (3).
Monitoring workflow progression
Both user ID admin and user ID user can monitor the progression of document 
workflow by using the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Workflow | 
Workflow Process window. Open this window, and find your workflow processes. 
Here, you will get the latest status of the document workflow.
The following is the sample data for our workflow process, taken from the 
Activity tab:
Next, we will continue our practice on how to cancel a workflow that is in progress.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 318 ]
Cancelling a workflow in progress
Prior to the approval processes, sometimes, we may need to cancel our document for 
some reason. And now, the status of document is waiting for approval. We need to 
cancel this document before our supervisor approves this requisition document.
Yes, you can cancel this document. For our practice, create another purchase 
requisition document. Log in with user ID user, with Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User 
as the role, and Shirt as the organization.  To enter a new purchase requisition 
document, follow the procedure mentioned in the Initiating a requisition document 
section, and finalize the requisition by completing this document.
Now, we are in the canceling stage. Open the Workflow Process window, and find 
your last Workflow Process record in the Process tab. Navigate to the Activity, and 
ensure that your active record is a (DocApproval) node with a Suspended workflow 
state. Change the view to detailed information by clicking on the Grid Toggle 
button. You will find the Manage Activity button in this window. Click on 
this button.
This will display a confirmation window, which has three options:
Abort Process
New User/Contact
New Workflow Responsible
Select the Abort Process field, and then click on the OK button, and this 
(DocApproval) node is aborted.
Setting up E-mail actions
Our manager is not always connected to the ADempiere system. In his daily 
activity, he only regularly checks his e-mail to monitor and keep communicating 
with his staff. If there are any documents that need his approval, an automatic 
notification sent to his e-mail will be helpful.
In the upcoming sections, we will set up an additional workflow configuration to 
send a notification e-mail to the Manager.

[ 319 ]
Activating the e-mail feature
We need to find a way to enable our e-mail feature. Log in with user ID admin, with 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and open the Menu | System Admin | 
Client Rules | Client window. In the Client tab, you will find some fields related to 
e-mail configuration. These fields need to be set up correctly.
An example of an e-mail configuration setup is as follows:
Mail Host set to 127.0.0.1 (this is for the SMTP mail host set up)
Request Email set to adempiere@sistematika.test
Request User set to adempiere
Request User Password set to adempiere
All of these values depend on your mail server configuration. Contact 
your e-mail administrator for the information required to set up this 
e-mail configuration.
After saving this e-mail configuration, click on the Test Email button. Ensure that 
you get a successful test message as shown in the following screenshot:
Setting up e-mail for end users
You need to set up e-mail addresses for all of the end users. With the e-mail address 
information, the system will send an e-mail to the users involved during running or 
executing a document workflow. Get the e-mail user ID and password information 
from your e-mail administrator. Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules 
| Security | User window. In the User Contact tab, find and set 
the following information:
Field\User-id

All of these e-mail values depend on your e-mail configuration. 
Feel free to set up your own e-mail addresses.
Setting up a mail template
We will set up a mail template for our requisition approval processes. In this 
template, we can define standard messages for delivering information via e-mail.
Open the Menu | Partner Relations | Mail Template window. In the Mail 
Template tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Requisition Approval.
3.	 Set the Subject field to Requisition Approval.
4.	 Set the Mail Text field to Dear manager, Need your help to review and 
approve the requisition document below.
Next, we will bind this mail template to our Process_Requisition workflow.
Altering workflow configuration
We will add a workflow activity/node, which will send an e-mail to certain users, 
and bind the mail template here.
Open the Workflow window, and find the Process_Requisition records in 
the Workflow tab. Navigate to the Node tab, and then add and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name field with (EmailToManager).
3.	 Set the Workflow Responsible with admin.
4.	 Set the Action with Email.
5.	 Set the EMail Recipient with WF Responsible.
6.	 Set the Mail Template with Requisition Approval.
Navigate to the Transition tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Next Node field to (DocApproval).
3.	 Set the Sequence field to 10.

Chapter 9
[ 321 ]
We need to restructure our (DocPrepare) node. Previously, the next transition 
cycle was (DocApproval). Navigate back to the Node tab, and find the (DocPrepare) 
record. Then navigate to the Transition tab, find the record which has a Sequence 
value of 10, alter the existing Next Node information to be (EmailToManager), and 
then save this information.
With this configuration, the flow is:
1.	 Total requisition value > 100
Start → DocPrepare → EmailToManager → DocApproval → DocComplete
2.	 Total requisition value <= 100
Start → DocPrepare → DocComplete
We can set the Workflow Responsible to user, role, or 
organization. If set to Organization, then the e-mail will 
be sent to the supervisor for the organization.
Testing the e-mail notification configuration
We need to test our configuration by creating a new Requisition document. Log 
in with user ID user, Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User as the role, and Shirt as the 
organization. Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Requisition window. 
In the Requisition tab, enter and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Document Type field to Purchase Requisition.
3.	 Set the Date Required field to today.
4.	 Set the Price List field to Purchase PL.
In the Requisition Line tab, enter and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Fabric.
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 115.
Save this record. You will have the total value set to 437. Complete this document, 
and the document status will be set to In Progress. You can check your workflow 
progression by watching the Workflow Process window.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 322 ]
The Manager is notified by e-mail, which contains a message, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
The information above the line is taken from the mail template, whereas the 
information under the line is the document information. The Manager can 
perform the approval activities based on this information.
Setting up an application process's action
After completing the requisition document, there is a feature to create a purchase 
order from a requisition. So, we manually execute this process to get our purchase 
order document. The question is, could we make it automatically?
As mentioned in the Creating a Purchase Order from a Purchase Requisition section of 
Chapter 5, Procurement Activities, we can convert an existing purchase requisition 
into a purchase order by executing the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Create 
PO from Requisition process. Behind the scenes, this process executes the internal 
ADempiere process, named M_Requisition_POCreate.
We can include this process into our workflow. So, when the Manager approves our 
requisition document, it will automatically create a purchase order document for us.
Finding the internal ADempiere process 
identity name
At the moment, all you need to know is how to identify the name of the ADempiere 
process that performs the Create PO from Requisition activity, and what kind of 
information is needed when executing this process.

Chapter 9
[ 323 ]
Log in to System (with the user ID System and using System Administrator as the 
role), navigate to the Menu | Application Dictionary | Report & Process window, 
and open this window. In the upcoming Lookup Record (search dialog) window, 
you need to enter Create PO from% in the Name field, click on the OK button, and 
you will be directed to a record that has Create PO from Requisition as the value in 
the Name field.
This window has three tabs: Report & Process, Report Access, and Parameter. To 
achieve our goal, we need to pay attention to the first and the third tab. With the 
Report & Process tab, just note down the value registered in the Search Key field. 
The value is M_Requisition_POCreate.
Identifying a parameter for a certain ADempiere 
processes
When executing the Create PO from Requisition process manually, you will 
be prompted with a confirmation window in which you can specify specific 
information such as Requisition number, Organization, and so on, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
Actually, the list of available confirmation information is registered in the Parameter 
tab of the process. Navigate to the Parameter tab. Here, the M_Requisition_POCreate 
process contains nine parameters. The first parameter registered has Requisition in the 
Name field, and has M_Requisition_ID in the DB Column Name field. Keep in mind 
the DB Column Name field information.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 324 ]
On entering and saving all of the documents, internally, ADempiere will 
generate a unique identity. In the case of the Requisition document, this 
unique identity information will be saved in the M_Requisition_ID field. 
We will use this field to identify the target Requisition document for our 
upcoming workflow configuration
Now, log out from the System user ID.
Additional workflow configuration
We need to register a new workflow that creates a purchase order automatically. 
Because we need this workflow to work only for the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd client, 
we will add this workflow configuration by accessing ADempiere using the user ID 
admin (as administrator of the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd client).
Log in with user ID admin using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and * 
as the organization. Open the Workflow window, and find the Process_Requisition 
records in the Workflow tab. Navigate to Node tab, and then add and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to (ConvertToPO).
3.	 Set the Action field to Apps Process.
4.	 Set the Process field to M_Requisition_POCreate (pick from the option list).
We need to inform this workflow about which requisition document needs to be 
processed. Navigate to the Parameter tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Process Parameter field to Requisition (pick from the 
available options).
2.	 Set the Attribute Value field to @M_Requisition_ID@.
Because the Process_Requisition workflow should work for the 
M_Requisition table, if we define @M_Requisition_ID@ in the Attribute 
Value field, ADempiere will take some value from the M_Requisition_ID 
field, and set this value as a parameter.

Chapter 9
[ 325 ]
Move to the Node tab, and find the (DocComplete) record. We need to set the next 
transition of this node or activity to (ConvertToPO) node or activity. Navigate 
to the Transition tab, and then add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Next Node field to (ConvertToPO).
3.	 Set the Sequence field to 10.
With this configuration, the flow would be:
1.	 Total requisition value is > 100
Start → DocPrepare → EmailToManager → DocApproval → DocComplete 
→ ConvertToPO
2.	 Total requisition value is <= 100
Start → DocPrepare → DocComplete → ConvertToPO
Creating the purchase order document from a requisition will be done 
only if the requisition document has a Complete status. This is the reason 
for putting the (ConvertToPO) node or activity after the (DocComplete) 
node or activity.
Testing the application process configuration
We can create a new requisition document to test our last configuration.
Log in with user ID user, Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User as the role, and Shirt as the 
organization. Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Requisition window. On 
the Requisition tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Document Type field to Purchase Requisition.
3.	 Set the Date Required field to today.
4.	 Set the Price List field to Purchase PL.
On the Requisition Line tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Button.
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 1500.
On saving this record, you will have the total value set to 120. Complete this 
document, and the document status is In Progress. You can check your workflow 
progression by watching the Workflow Process window.

ADempiere Workflow
[ 326 ]
Log in with user ID admin, Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and Shirt as 
the organization. Open the Workflow Activities window, and set the approval for 
this document. After this activity, ADempiere will proceed to convert our requisition 
document into a purchase order document. Check both the Workflow Process and 
the Purchase Order window.
The following screenshot shows a sample of the purchase order document, which is 
generated automatically when executing our Process_Requisition workflow:
As you can see in the screenshot above, this purchase order document is created 
from requisition number 900008, as mentioned in the Description field.
Setting up a Variable's action
You might need to automatically set the value of one or more available fields 
to your own value when processing your document. This condition applies 
when implementing the following action:
Set a constant value (the only value) for a registered field
The list of available fields that can be set up are all of the fields that belong to 
the tables that are configured in the Table field located on the Workflow tab of 
the Workflow window. For example, the Process_Requisition workflow uses the 
M_Requisition table (shown as M_Requisition_Requisition in the Table field). You 
can set a constant value to all of the fields that belong to the M_Requisition table.
•

Chapter 9
[ 327 ]
We will guide you through entering a constant value in the Description field when 
processing the Process_Requisition workflow.
Configuring the set attribute action
We need to create a new activity or node in the Process_Requisition workflow that 
aims to set a variable or constant in the Description field.
Log in with user ID admin, Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and * as the 
organization. Open the Workflow window, and find the Process_Requisition record 
on the Workflow tab. Navigate to the Node tab, and then add and save the 
following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name fields to (SetVariable).
3.	 Set the Action field to Set Variable.
4.	 Set the Column field to Description (shown as Description_Description in 
the option list; here, you will see a list of available fields that belong to the 
M_Requisition table).
5.	 Set the Attribute Value with Sample of constant text.
Navigate to the Transition tab, and then add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization to *.
2.	 Set the Next Node to (ConvertToPO).
3.	 Set the Sequence with 10.
We need to re-structure the next transition for the (DocComplete) node. Navigate to 
the Node tab, and find the (DocComplete) records. We need to set the next transition 
of this activity or node to (SetVariable). Navigate to the Transition tab, alter the 
existing record, and then enter and save the following information:
Set the Next Node field to (SetVariable).
With this configuration, the flow would be:
1.	 Total requisition value is > 100
Start → DocPrepare → EmailToManager → DocApproval → DocComplete 
→ SetVariable → ConvertToPO
2.	 Total requisition value is <= 100
Start → DocPrepare → DocComplete → SetVariable → ConvertToPO
•

ADempiere Workflow
[ 328 ]
You can check this flow visually by opening the Menu | System Admin 
| General Rules | Workflow | Workflow Editor window and setting 
the Process_Requisition in the option list of the workflow.
Testing the set variable workflow
Now, create a new requisition document to test our configuration.
Log in with user ID user, with Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User as the role, and Shirt as 
the organization. Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Requisition window. 
On the Requisition tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Document Type field to Purchase Requisition.
3.	 Set the Date Required field to today.
4.	 Set the Price List field to Purchase PL.
On the Requisition Line tab, enter and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Button.
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 1000.
3.	 Save this record.
You will have the total value set to 80. With the current workflow configuration, 
this value is less than 100, so there is no need to get an approval from your manager. 
Just complete this document, and the document status will have Complete as its 
document status.
Now take a look at your Description field. It should automatically have the 
Sample of constant text value, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
[ 329 ]
Take a look at Workflow Process to examine the workflow steps. Ensure that you 
are in the last record (the requisition that has 80 as the total value), and navigate to 
the Activity tab. You will have a (SetVariable) node; find the Text Message field. 
This should contain Description=Sample of constant text, which makes sure that 
this text has come from workflow.
Document value workflow
Our Manager talked about a rule or condition. If there are any activities to 
cancel (void) an existing document (for example, a purchase order document 
related to a specific business partner), then the system should give us an alert 
that this document has been canceled. Could you help me to accommodate the 
manager's requirement?
We will send the Manager a notification e-mail if there are any purchase order 
cancellations for a certain business partner. We will look at how ADempiere 
catches the condition itself.
ADempiere has a mechanism for monitoring a new value inserted or updated in its 
database table, when saving any information. This saving activity can be triggered by:
The user: User clicks on the Save button.
Internal ADempiere system: An internal ADempiere process and\or 
calculation inserts or updates any information.
Both of these conditions are monitored by default. In your case, we just need 
to tell ADempiere:
Please help me in monitoring the purchase order document. If the document status 
becomes void or is canceled, and contains Hempel China Limited as the business 
partner, then please inform me via e-mail.
Setting up a new mail template
We need to set up a mail template, which can be used as a standard information 
header for this cancellation or for voiding purchase order activities.
Log in with user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and * as 
the organization. Open the Menu | Partner Relations | Mail Template window. On 
the Mail Template tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name and Subject fields to Canceling document information.
•

ADempiere Workflow
[ 330 ]
3.	 Set the Mail Text field to Dear manager, please be informed that the 
following document has been canceled.
Next, continue with creating a new workflow.
Defining configuration
We need to create a new workflow for our example. Open the Workflow window. 
On the Workflow tab, add and then save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Search Key and Name field to PO_VoidingAlert.
3.	 Set the Workflow Type field to Document Value.
4.	 Set the Table field to C_Order.
5.	 Set the Document Value Logic field to @docstatus@=VO.
6.	 Set the Data Access Level field to Client+Organization.
7.	 Set the Author field to your name.
@docstatus@=VO means that ADempiere should take the value of 
the docstatus field of the C_Order table. If this value is VO (condition 
VO=VO is fulfilled), then this workflow will be executed.
Navigate to the Access tab. We will allow the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User role to 
access this workflow. Add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Role field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User.
3.	 Select both, the Active and Read Write checkboxes.
Now, navigate to the Node tab. We need to set three workflows: (Start), 
(SendEmail), and (End). You can add and save the following information:

Partner window and point your record to Hempel China Limited. 
Double-click in the Record Info area, and you will get information 
such as C_BPartner - C_BPartner_ID=1000003.
Internally, both the Purchase Order and Sales Order window persist its 
information in the C_Order table (check the Record Info in both of these 
windows). The internal difference between these windows is the information 
in the IsSOTrx field. With IsSOTrx = N (which means that this is not a sales 
transaction), we just instruct the system to process this workflow for the 
Purchase Order window only.

1000016 is the internal ID of the Purchase Order document type in the 
author's ADempiere installation.
Next, we need to set the transition from (SendEmail) to the (End) node. Go back to 
the Node tab, set your active record to (SendEmail), and navigate to the Transition 
tab. Add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Next Node field to (End).
With this configuration, the flow would be:
1.	 If the purchase order document is canceled in the purchase order window 
and the business partner is Hempel China Limited:
(Start) → (SendEmail) → (End)
2.	 If the purchase order document is canceled and the business partner is not 
Hempel China Limited:
(Start) → (End)
You are almost done. The last thing to do is to navigate to the Workflow tab, set the 
Start Node field to (Start), and save it. Click on the Validate Workflow button, and 
ensure that you get an OK message on the bottom left side of this window.
Testing the document value workflow
We need to create the purchase order document, and then complete and void 
this document.
Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Purchase Order window. In the 
Purchase Order tab, add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt.
2.	 Set the Target Document Type field to Purchase Order.
3.	 Set the Date Ordered and Date Promised field to today.
4.	 Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited.
5.	 Set the Price List field to Purchase PL.
Navigate to the PO Line tab, then add and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to PA Fabric Red.
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 500.
•

Chapter 9
[ 333 ]
Leave the other fields unchanged. On saving this PO Line record, the total value for 
this PO will be 1900. Finalize these tasks by completing this document.
To cancel this document, on the Purchase Order tab, click on the Close button. This 
will display a Document Action confirmation window. In the Document Action 
field, click on the option list, set it to Void, and then click on the OK button.
Take a look at your Workflow Process window. Check the, newest record, and then 
navigate to the Activity tab. The author's system showed the following output:
We will also check the e-mail that was delivered to our manager. This e-mail 
will contain a notification and a PDF file attachment, which contains the voided 
purchase order document.
Document value logic format
In the previous example, we put @docstatus@=VO in the Document Value Logic 
field. This is the basis of the document value logic format. We can divide this format 
into three parts, as follows:
Document Value: In this example, the value is @docstatus@ 
Operator: In this example, the value is =
Evaluation Value: In this example, the values is VO
The following sections provide us with additional details.
Document and Evaluation Value
When entering the condition in the logic format condition for both the Document 
Value and Evaluation Value parts, we can enter:
A value taken from the ADempiere context (check all of the available 
context variables in the Tools | Preference window, and navigate to the 
Context tab) or a value taken from an ADempiere table field. In general, to 
get the value from the context, for example #AD_Org_Name, you will enter 
@#AD_Org_Name@. If you need to get a value from the DocStatus field 
from the C_Order table (check the Record Info in the Purchase Order 
window), you would enter @docstatus@.

Constant value (like VO in our case).
Next, we will introduce you to the operator.
Operator
Here, we can use several types of operands. The following is an operator list and the 
meaning of the operands:
Operator
Description
!
not equal
=
equal
^
not equal
>
bigger than
<
lesser than
You can create your own logic format to suits your needs. You can familiarize 
yourself with these rules.
Multiple logic
In the previous example, it seems that we are only comparing two values 
(a single criterion). Does the document value logic support multiple logic, 
such as comparing more than one criterion?
Yes, definitely. You need to use a logical operator between the logic, as shown in the 
following table:
Operator
Description
|
or
&
And
If you need to fulfill a requirement such as: "please execute this workflow while the 
document status is either complete or draft", you would enter:
@docstatus@=CO|@docstatus@=DR
in the document value logic, and it will work for you.

SQL document value logic format
Somebody from the class course just shouts out:
The previous format is not human-readable. I could misinterpret this format. An 
operand like @ and | could make me crazy. Is there any other easier format when 
writing document value logic?
There is an alternative way of entering document value logic. This logic, has a clear 
enough format. For example, we were previously entering @docstatus@=CO. In 
addition to entering those phrases, you can enter it as SQL=DOCSTATUS = 'CO'. 
With this syntax, ADempiere executes this workflow into an active purchase order 
document that has a document status of CO (means Complete).
While writing this new format, you have to ensure the following things:
Prefix your statement with SQL=
You need to be aware of spaces when writing this phrase, especially if you 
have multiple logical statements
The format @docstatus@=CO|@docstatus@=DR can be replaced with:
SQL=DOCSTATUS = 'CO' OR DOCSTATUS='DR'
You can enter a complex criteria such as the following:
SQL=(DOCSTATUS = 'CO' OR DOCSTATUS = 'DR') AND (TOTALLINES >= 500)
This means that ADempiere will perform internal checks if this purchase order 
document has a draft or complete document status, and the total value of this 
purchase order is more than 500, and will execute this workflow only if all of 
these conditions are true.
Summary
Workflow is defined as a step-by-step activity to complete a task that involves both, 
people and a system. As a default, all of the documents in ADempiere (for example, 
Purchase Requisition, Purchase Order, MM Receipt, and so on) are automatically 
workflow-enabled, and the standard workflow is easy to extend or modify.
To introduce you to the workflow, we worked on configuring a general type 
of workflow. Because all of the nodes executed in this workflow require user 
interaction, there was nothing to be done internally by ADempiere when 
processing this workflow.
•
•

ADempiere Workflow
[ 336 ]
We set activities via nodes in the ADempiere workflow. In this activity, we set up 
an action. When processing the nodes, we set up who is responsible for performing 
this activity.
We followed this with a case study, which showed you how to set up an approval 
workflow that utilizes the User Choice action. We provided information on how 
ADempiere finds a person who is responsible for setting the approval action.
We monitored the progress of the workflow. ADempiere provides a Workflow 
Process window, which shows the status of each of the nodes. When monitoring, 
we can also perform the cancellation of a running workflow.
Next, we extended our example, to utilize an e-mail notification, executing an 
application process type of node, and setting a variable. We revealed how to 
configure this type of node, and gave some examples of how these workflows work.
On saving any data or document in the ADempiere system, the system has a feature 
to monitor a new value that has been inserted or updated. Based on this value, 
we can initiate a workflow activity. We called this procedure the Document Value 
workflow. There are two ways of configuring the document value workflow, and 
we saw both of these.
We will discuss the Info and Reporting capabilities in our next chapter. That chapter  
will tell us how to get information and how to configure reports in ADempiere.

Reporting Management
So far, you have practiced entering documents that simulate a common manufacturing 
business processes. After entering our documents, we could take a print-out and 
examine the results from the standard predefined reports provided by ADempiere. On 
producing reports, internally, ADempiere reads some configuration settings, retrieves 
information from databases, and then displays the requested reports.
Furthermore, with all of the accounting facts/GL journal entries generated, we can 
analyze the company's performance, by creating a financial statement such as a 
Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss statement, and other types of financial reports.
In this chapter, we will learn what type of configurations are involved in producing 
standard reports and financial reports, and provide you with some preliminary 
information on the Info window feature.
In this chapter, we will take a look at:
Reports and printing
Customizing reports
Financial reporting
The Info window
Based on this information, you can alter the standard reports provided and make 
them fit to your organization's needs.

Introduction to the ADempiere standard 
printing feature
For each of the standard ADempiere windows, you will see a standard toolbar, 
which contains icons such as the ones shown in following screenshot:
From the left-hand side to the right-hand side of the previous screenshot, the names 
of the buttons in the toolbar are:
Report
Archived Documents/Reports
Print Preview
Print
You can refer to the Other tasks section under the Performing tasks heading in 
Chapter 2, Exploring the ADempiere Client and Performing Tasks, for the preliminary 
explanation of these buttons. We will show examples of the use of these buttons in 
following sections.
Accessing the Report button
The main purpose of this button is to display columnar information for a selected 
document in the window.
Log in with user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and 
Shirt as the organization. Open the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Purchase Order 
window. Having performed the activities in the earlier chapters, you will already have 
a number of purchase order documents. Just select one of the available records (the 
first purchase order document is recommended), and then click on the Report button.
After clicking on the Report button, in the author's installation, we will get an order 
header report similar to the following screenshot:
•
•
•
•

Chapter 10
[ 339 ]
Working with the Drill down feature
The purpose of this feature is to provide detailed information about a certain column.
In the report in the previous screenshot, you can see underlined information in the 
Target Doc Type and Business Partner columns. Your own report may have a lot of 
underlined information.
Using the Drill down feature, you can double-click on the underlined information 
to see a report providing the detailed information for the selected information. For 
example, in the order header report that we have seen in the previous screenshot, the 
Business Partner column has Hempel China Limited underlined. Double-clicking 
this information will show you a report containing detailed information about 
the Hempel China Limited business partner.
This feature is similar to the Zoom feature (refer to the Field context menu 
section of Chapter 2, Exploring the ADempiere Client and Performing Tasks). 
The difference is that the Zoom feature provides detailed information by 
opening a window, whereas Drill down provides detailed information by 
showing a report.
Working with the Drill across feature
The purpose of this feature is to see the list of documents created, using, or having 
a reference to certain data.
For our example, open the Menu | Partner Relations | Business Partner Rules | 
Business Partner window and find Hempel China Limited. Click on the Report 
button. At the top of this report, you will have a drop-down of Drill options, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
There are many options available in the Drill field. Select Order/Purchase Order 
for our example, and then double-click on the report line information. You will get 
a list of purchase order reports that were created using the Hempel China Limited 
business partner.

Reporting Management
[ 340 ]
This feature is similar to the Zoom Across feature (refer to More examples 
on the use of Zoom Across section of Chapter 2, Implementing the ADempiere 
Client and Performing Tasks). The difference is that the Zoom Across 
feature provides a list of information by opening a window, whereas 
Drill Across provides a list of information by showing a report.
Printing a report
Reopen the Menu | Requisition-to-Invoice | Purchase Order window. In this 
purchase order document, you can take a Print preview or Print of this document. 
We will take a look at the standard toolbar available in the Report form, and 
introduce you to the print format template, in the following sections.
Introducing print format templates
The print format template is a feature for managing a template report in ADempiere.
Take a Print preview of the purchase order document. After the Print preview, there 
will be a Report form available. Check the available toolbar at the top of this report. 
On the right-hand side of the Drill field, a print format template, which is used to 
generate this report, will be shown, as follows:
In the screenshot, from the left-hand side to the right-hand side are the:
Drill across options
Print format template
Customize report button
In the author's installation, the print format template used to generate the purchase 
order report is Order_Header ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 192611.
The print format template shown in your installation will be different. 
It will show Order_Header ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record and a number 
other than 192611.

Chapter 10
[ 341 ]
Next, we will take a look at the Order_Header ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 192611 
print format template in detail. We can open this print format template by clicking 
on the Customize Report button or by accessing the Menu | System Admin | 
General Rules | Printing | Print Format window. This window contains four tabs: 
Print Format, Display Order, Sort Order, and Format Item. The explanation of 
these tabs is as follows:
Print Format tab contains the configuration for:
Table: This is the source table from the application dictionary.
Form: Select this checkbox for pre-formatted reports of 
documents. Any report that has master-detail information has 
this checkbox selected. Deselecting this checkbox means that a 
columnar list of reports is created.
Print paper: This defines the target paper for the reports.
Font and Color: This defines the fonts and color to be used in 
the reports.
Copy/Create button: This can be used to copy an existing print 
format, or create a new one from the existing Table.
The Display Order tab contains all of the available fields, which come from 
the Table information in the Print Format tab. You can make a list of the 
fields that need to be shown, and create an order for these fields.
The Sort Order tab defines the short order of the print format items 
when showing multiple records. Usually, this will be used in the 
detail parts of reports.
The Format Item tab determines the detail format appearance when 
generating reports. The important points in this configuration are:
The Sequence field: The sequence not only determines the order 
of the on-screen appearance, but also the order in which the 
fields are processed for the report.
The Format Type field: You can set the following configuration:
Field information is taken from the application 
dictionary table column. When using Field as your 
format type, you can set a bar code format, where 
necessary, in the Barcode Type field.
Image can be used to define your own (company) 
logo. You can specify an image from a table column 
or uniform resource locator (URL).
Rectangle or Line.

Text defines your own text. You can define standard 
variables to represent information. The list and the 
purpose of the standard variable format is as follows:
@*Page@: Current page number
@*PageCount@: Total number of pages in 
the report
@*MultiPageInfo@: If we have more than one 
page in the report, this will shown Page x of y
@*ReportName@: Print format template name
@*Header@: Print user, client and connection 
information
@*CurrentDate@: Print the current date
@*CurrentDateTime@: Print the current date 
with time
Print Format. Here, you can insert another Print Format. 
During the display of master-detail information, like our 
Purchase Order document reports, we need to set up 
another print format.  In the author's system, the 
Order_Header ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 192611 
print format templates use  the Order_LineTax ** 
1000000 ** &Copy Record 22157425 print format 
template as part of their report confguration. Refer to 
records that have 250 as their Sequence value. The 
Order_LineTax ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 22157425 
should be used to generate order line information 
(detailed data of  the purchase order). 
For the report's layout, you can determine the position when 
displaying information in the reports, by using the Area, 
Relative Position, Set NL Position, Next Line, Next Page, 
Line Alignment, X Space and Y Space fields.
Sending e-mail, archiving reports, and exporting
After displaying the Print Preview for your document, you can:
Send the report to your colleague by using the Send Email facility
Make an archive of the report by using Archived Documents/Reports
Export the report in various formats by using the Export feature

In the toolbar available, on the right-hand side of the Customize Report button, 
you can access these features by clicking on the buttons, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How the ADempiere window finds its print 
format templates
On executing the Print preview or Print button, internally, the ADempiere window 
has a mechanism to find the location of the print format templates being used, 
and will then produce a report using this print format template. Refer to the 
following sections to know which print format template is used for a certain 
ADempiere window.
Purchase Order and Sales Order
In the default configuration, ADempiere windows such as Purchase Order and Sales 
Order will use the following procedure to find the print format template:
First, it will check the Print Format field value in the Menu | Performance 
Analysis | Accounting Rules | Document Type window for the target 
document type.
Second, if there is no print format found in the first step, it will check 
the value in the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Printing | 
Print Form window. As a standard, this form shall contain two records. 
The first record has the value System in the Client field, and the second 
has Sistematika Fashion, Ltd. Ensure that your active records are for 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd, click on the Grid Toggle button (to show a 
detailed record), and then find the Order Print Format field.
If there is no value in the Order Print Format field, ADempiere will raise a 
No Document Print Format defined error message.
Invoice
If you are working with an ADempiere window such as:
Invoice (Vendor)
Invoice (Customer)
•
•
•
•
•

Reporting Management
[ 344 ]
then the following procedure will be used to find the print format template:
First, it will check the Invoice Print Format field value in the Customer tab 
of the Menu | Partner Relations | Business Partner Rules | Business 
Partner window.
Second, if there is no print format available in the first step, it will check 
the Print Format field value in the Document Type window for the target 
document type.
Third, if there is no print format found in the second step, then it will check 
for a value in the Print Form window. Ensure that your active record is for 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd, and click on the Grid Toggle button to show the 
detail record, and then find the Invoice Print Format field.
If there is no value in the Invoice Print Format field in the third step, 
ADempiere will raise a No Document Print Format defined error message.
Payment
When working with the Payment window, the two fields (or information) that have 
a direct relationship with the printing process are:
Bank Account
Tender Type (such as Check, Credit Card, Direct Debit, or Direct Deposit)
On printing the document in this Payment window, ADempiere will check the 
Check Print Format field value in the Menu | System Admin | Organization 
Rules | Bank window. The following procedure will be used to find the print 
format template:
Find the target bank information in the Bank tab, and choose your account 
number on the Account tab.
In the existing record on the Account tab, navigate to the Bank Account 
Document tab, select the record that has the appropriate Payment Rule 
such as Check, Credit Card, Direct Debit, or Direct Deposit (as specified 
in the Tender Type field, when entering the payment information) and 
examine the Check Print Format field.
If there are no values in these fields, then ADempiere will raise a No 
Document Print Format defined error message.

Shipment (Customer) and Material Receipt
To take a print of this window, ADempiere will carry out the following procedure:
First, it will check the Print Format field value in the Document Type 
window for the targeted document type.
Second, if there is no print format found in the first step, then it will check 
for a value in the Print Form window. Ensure that your active records is 
for Sistematika Fashion, Ltd , click on the Grid Toggle button to show 
the detailed records, and then find the Shipment Print Format field.
If there are no values in this field, ADempiere will raise a No Document 
Print Format defined error message.
Customizing Reports
In the available print format template, we are free to modify the template to suit 
our needs. We will play with our Purchase Order document in the Purchase Order 
window, and customize the print format template, which finally shows a report 
similar to the following screenshot:

Reporting Management
[ 346 ]
Compare this report layout with the current, default print out of your purchase order 
document. There will be a difference in the appearance of the:
Logo
Header information composition
Layout of the detailed order information
Amount in words
We will try to alter the standard, default format and create a report in the format 
shown in the previous screenshot.
Creating new print format templates
As mentioned previously, there were two print format templates involved while 
producing the Purchase Order document reports. In the author's installation, the 
templates were:
Order_Header ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 192611
Order_LineTax ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 22157425
Take a look at the following screenshot:
The first print format (Order_Header ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 192611) is just a 
duplicate print format of Order_Header  ** TEMPLATE **, whereas the third print 
format (Order_LineTax ** 1000000 ** &Copy Record 22157425) is a duplicate of 
Order_LineTax  ** TEMPLATE **. We need to create another print format based 
on these templates.

Duplicate Order Line print format
Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Printing | Print Format 
window. In the Print Format tab, click on the Lookup Record button, enter 
Order_LineTax  ** TEMPLATE ** in the Name field, and click on the OK 
button. With the existing record, you need to:
1.	 Copy this available record to a new one by pressing the Shift + F2 
key combination.
2.	 Set the Name field to Order Line Sistematika, and then save this record.
With this activity, we just create duplicate information in the Print Format tab but 
not the configuration in Display Order, Sort Order, and Format Item tabs.
To duplicate all three of the tabs' information or configuration, in this Order Line 
Sistematika record, you need to perform the following:
1.	 Click on the Copy/Create button.
2.	 Enter Order_LineTax  ** TEMPLATE ** in the Print Format field, and then 
click on the OK button.
3.	 Upon processing this procedure, the Name field value will be overridden 
by the system, and we will need to re-enter a value in the Name field back 
to Order Line Sistematika.
We will continue our activity and create a duplicate order header print format.
Duplicate Order Header print format
In the Print Format tab, click on the Lookup Record button, enter Order_Header 
** TEMPLATE ** in the Name field, and then click on the OK button. With existing 
records, you need to perform the following:
1.	 Copy the available record to a new one by pressing the Shift + F2 
key combination.
2.	 Set the Name field to Order Header Sistematika, and then click on the 
Save button.
Duplicate the remaining three tabs' information or configuration by performing 
the following:
1.	 Click on the Copy/Create button.
2.	 Enter Order_Header  ** TEMPLATE ** in the Print Format field, and 
then click on the OK button.
3.	 Change the value in the Name field to Order Header Sistematika.

Reporting Management
[ 348 ]
The next important thing that we need to configure is to set up our new Order 
Header Sistematika template to use the Order Line Sistematika print format 
template. To achieve this, you need to perform the following:
1.	 Navigate to the Format Item tab, and find a record that has 250 in the 
Sequence field and Order in the Name field.
2.	 Click on the Grid Toggle button to show the detailed information, 
and change the Included Print Format configuration from 
Order_LineTax  ** TEMPLATE ** to Order Line Sistematika.
3.	 Finalize the task by clicking on the Save button.
This Order Header Sistematika print format template requires 
the Order Line Sistematika print format template as a part of 
its configuration. That is why we need to create the Order Line 
Sistematika print format template first.
Setting the purchase order default print format
We need to set the Order Header Sistematika print format as a default template for 
our Purchase Order document printing.
We can do this by opening the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Printing 
| Print Form window (not the Print Format window). There will be two records 
available in this window. Make sure that your active record has Sistematika 
Fashion, Ltd as the Client, and select Order Header Sistematika in the Order 
Print Format field, as shown in the following screenshot:

Altering the logo
The default ADempiere installation comes with the adempiere_5a.jpg picture 
example. You can access this file in the C:\Adempiere\images folder. To practice, 
we will use this image for our company logo.
ADempiere recognizes images that are in JPG or GIF file format.
Open the Purchase Order window. Select the first Purchase Order document, and 
click on the Print Preview button to create a report for this document. With this 
preview, click on the Customize Report button, and you will see Order Header 
Sistematika print format records in the Print Format window.
Navigate to the Format Item tab, and find the record with the following condition:
Sequence of 10
Name of Logo
Actually, this is the first record in the Format Item tab. Click on the Grid Toggle 
button, and change the values of the following fields:
1.	 Image URL to file:C://Adempiere//images//adempiere_5a.jpg.
2.	 Max Width to 300.
3.	 Max Height to 50.
Note: The Max Width and Max Height configuration will depend upon the size 
(in pixels) of the image.
Save and close the Print Format window.
After some modifications to the Print Format, you will be able to 
see the changes in your current print preview.

Altering the detailed purchase order layout
Next, we will continue with our activity to re-organize the detailed information. In 
the Format Item tab, navigate to the record that has 260 as the Sequence and Order 
as the Name.
Initially, the Sequence for Order was 250. Now, it has become 
260 because of our previous activities to change the field 
ordering in Display Order.
Click on the Grid Toggle button to show the detailed information, and navigate to 
the Included Print Format field. Right-click on this field, and select the Zoom button. 
Now, you are already in the Order Line Sistematika print format.
Navigate to the Display Order tab. This tab contains the Available Choices and 
Sequence information. We need to include some information listed in the Available 
Choices, and then set the correct information ordering.
In the Available Choices list, move the Line No and Product Key to the Sequence 
area by clicking on the right green arrow (
).
In the Sequence area, move the Description and Name field to Available Choices. 
There is no need to show this information. Perform the appropriate ordering, and 
ensure that the information is ordered as shown in the following screenshot:
Next, navigate to the Format Item tab, and deselect the Suppress Null checkbox for 
the record that has a Sequence of 60 and a Name of Discount %.
The task is now complete.

Financial Reporting
Every organization needs some financial reports in order to analyze their 
business. Based on the available financial data in the system, ADempiere can help 
the organization by producing reports such as Balance Sheets, Profit and Loss 
Statements, Statements of Account, and other types of financial reports.
When creating the new Client, these types of reports are not available by default. 
This is because they are heavily dependent on the Chart of Accounts, which should 
be unique for each company. You need to perform some configuration to create your 
own financial reporting format.
ADempiere provides the following list of windows for working with 
financial reporting:
Report Line Set
Report Column Set
Reporting Hierarchy
Financial Report
When looking at financial reports, they generally have two-dimensional information. 
These dimensions are mapped into columns and lines (or rows), as shown in the 
following screenshot:
•

Reporting Management
[ 354 ]
The Asset row (mentioned in row 2 in the previous screenshot) and the other row's 
information should be configured in the Report Line Set window, whereas the 
Beginning Balance column (which is mentioned in the B column in the above figure) 
and the other column's information should be configured in the Report Column Set 
window. Keeping this format in mind, we will now create some report configurations.
Working with the Report Line Set window
You can create financial reports that contain information on your list of accounts, 
according to your needs. In our example, we will create a configuration to display 
only the Asset, Liabilities, Owner Equity, and Total report line information.
Open the Menu | Performance Analysis | Financial Reporting | Report Line 
Set window. This window has three tabs: Report Line Set, Report Line, and 
Report Source.
In the Report Line Set tab, click on the New button, and set the following information:
1.	 Set Organization to *.
2.	 Set Name to Account Information.
Navigate to the Report Line tab. Add and save the following information:

Here, if you set 1 – Asset as an Account Element, you have just selected 
one account that has a Summary Account type. As you can see in our 
Account Element window, this 1 – Asset account element has many 
summary accounts (non-posting) and transaction accounts (posting), 
that point to it. This account configuration means that the 1 – Asset 
account shall contain a summed-up value taken from listed posting and 
non-posting accounts belonging to 1 – Asset.
We need to set the Total information in the Report Line tab. This effort is designed 
to sum up the values of Asset, Liabilities, and Owner Equity. Add and save the

Working with the Report Column Set window
We now need to configure the Beginning Balance, Debit Transaction, Credit 
Transaction, and Ending Balance for our financial reports example. Open the Menu 
| Performance Analysis | Financial Reporting | Report Column Set window. This 
window contains two tabs: Report Column Set, and Report Column.
We create some configurations with the following conditions:
Beginning Balance means the total balance in the previous period
Debit Transaction means the total debit transaction in the active period
Credit Transaction means the total credit transaction in the active period
Period Balance means the total balance in the active period (net balance of 
Debit Transaction and Credit Transaction)
Ending Balance means the ending balance up to and including active period 
(Beginning Balance plus Period Balance value)
Growth means the percentage difference between the Ending Balance and the 
Beginning Balance

Creating a Financial Report
In the previous activities, we created one report line set in the Report Line Set 
window, and one report column set in the Report Column Set window. As per your 
requirements, you can create many report line sets (that use a certain account) and 
report column sets, to fulfill your financial analysis requirements.
Following these activities, you can create a financial report based on the combination 
of report line set and report column set.
For example, we can create an Asset, Liabilities and Equity list report. Open the 
Menu | Performance Analysis | Financial Reporting | Financial Report window. 
This window contains only one tab. Click on the New button, and then add and save 
the following information:

In the author's installation, the report appears as follows (the actual numbers may 
vary with your installation, but the format generated should be the same):
Because we only have financial data for one accounting period in the author's 
example, there is no Beginning Balance or Growth information available. 
Once we have financial data for more than one accounting period, the 
information will be present.
After saving this Financial Report record, we can utilize this record 
to create Asset, Liabilities, and Equity list reports in the future. There 
is no need to create a new Financial Report record again. Just select an 
available Financial Report record, click on the Create Report button, 
and you are done.
Enabling the List Sources option
In the previous screenshot, the system has created summary reports for Asset, 
Liabilities, and Owner Equity. ADempiere has a feature to show the detailed 
sources of accounts involved when producing this report. In the Asset, Liabilities 
and Equity list financial report previously created, be sure to select the List 
Sources checkbox prior to executing the Create Report button, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Process the report, and you will be shown the list of posting accounts involved for 
the Asset, Liabilities, and Owner Equity.

Reporting Hierarchy
Previously, we created a report summary by using all of the available financial 
data in the selected active periods. There are some questions raised during our 
implementation, such as: how to produce this financial report for a specific business 
partner and/or product only?
ADempiere has a feature to create summary reports based on the selection or 
criteria of available account schema element configuration. In order to determine 
your account schema element configuration, you can open the Accounting Schema 
window, and navigate to the Account Schema Element tab. In the author's 
ADempiere system, we get the following list of active account schema elements:
You can create a summary of financial reports with a combination option of available 
account schema elements, such as Organization and Product. In the Organization 
and Product account schema element, we can determine the selection information 
required (such as Shirt for Organization and S Fabric, S Button, and S Label 
for Product).
For our example, we will create a summarized report based on only the Product 
account schema element, and involving the following list of products:
S Fabric
S Button
S Label
Configuring a specific financial report
We need to set a series of tasks (including new summary product creation, managing 
Tree, and setting up the reporting hierarchy) to fulfill this requirement. This will be 
explained in the subsequent sections.

Setting up a Summary of Products Tree
As a part of reporting configuration, we need to set up a special Tree. Reporting 
Hierarchy that will use this special Tree, while producing the summarized 
financial report.
Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | System Rules | Tree window. 
Add and save the following information:
1.	 Set Organization to *.
2.	 Set Name to Summary of Products.
3.	 Set Type | Area to Product.
4.	 Select the All Nodes checkbox.
We will include a list of products as a part of Summary of Products in the 
subsequent sections.

Chapter 10
[ 361 ]
Setting Tree Maintenance
The purpose of this effort is to include a list of products in the Summary of Products 
Tree, which was created previously. Open the Menu | System Admin | General 
Rules | System Rules | Tree Maintenance window.
Select Summary of Products in the Tree field. This window has two parts. The 
left-hand side is for the list of products already connected to this Summary of 
Products Tree, whereas the right-hand side is the list of available products.
The first thing that needs to be done is to move the Summary of 3 products to the 
left-hand side of this window. You can perform this task by selecting this product 
from the available products and then clicking on the Add To Tree button. Do the 
same thing for the S Fabric, S Button, and S Label products.
Next, we need to include the S Fabric, S Button, and S Label products in this 
Summary of 3 products product. You can perform drag-and-drop activities here. 
Be sure that you complete this setup, and the left-hand side must be as shown in 
the following screenshot:
Verifying the Summary of Products Tree
After inserting some value for the tree maintenance, you need to verify the Summary 
of Products Tree itself. Navigate to the Tree window, and point your records to the 
Summary of Products. Click on the Verify Tree button, and then click on the OK 
button in the upcoming confirmation window.

that you select the correct one.
Testing our sample reporting hierarchy reports
Well, the configuration is done. We now need to create a sample report with this 
new configuration.
Open the Financial Report window. We will use our Asset, Liabilities and 
Equity list report. Deselect the List Sources checkbox, and then click on the Create 
Report button. In the upcoming Create Report confirmation window, make the 
following changes:
1.	 Set Product to Summary of 3 products.
2.	 Set Reporting Hierarchy to Summary of certain product.

[ 364 ]
When creating the Summary of certain products reporting hierarchy 
information, we specify Summary of products in the Product Tree field, 
and keep the other tree fields as default. With this configuration, the 
summary reports will be processed correctly when you enter the correct 
information in the Product and Reporting Hierarchy fields in the Create 
Report confirmation window.
In the author's installation (the numbers might vary with yours), the resulting 
reports are as follows:
You can compare this report against the financial reports previously generated 
without applying a specific product and reporting hierarchy in the Create Report 
confirmation window. 
More details on the summary financial report
Well, we need to create this summary report for those three products and using 
both Hempel China Limited and Coats and Clarks (business partner), could you 
show me how to create this report?
With this new requirement, you need to perform the tasks described in the 
following sections.
Setting up a new summary business partner
We need to create a summary business partner that will summarize the two 
business partners. Open the Business Partner window, and then add and save 
the following information:
1.	 Set Organization to *.
2.	 Set Search Key and Name to Summary of 2 BP.
3.	 Select the Summary Level checkbox.

Chapter 10
[ 365 ]
Here, we have no additional Business Partner Group information. 
You can define a new Business Partner Group and attach this 
newly-created information into the appropriate field when needed.
Leave the other fields unchanged. Next, we need to configure a special Tree, as 
explained in the next section.
Setting up a Summary of BP Tree
Open the Tree window. Add and save the following information:
1.	 Set Organization to *.
2.	 Set Name to Summary of BP.
3.	 Set Type | Area to BPartner.

Summary
This chapter introduced you to the print feature, which comes with the standard 
ADempiere window. You can perform a Report, Print Preview and Print, or Archive 
and Export your document.
The standard features, such as drill down and drill across, which are used when 
previewing our reports, were explained. To print a document, there are some print 
format templates that are used to produce a document report. We introduced what 
a print format template is, and how to find the print format template used for a 
certain document.
After introducing the concept of the print format template, we then created a new 
print format template, based on the existing templates, and modified this template 
to suit our needs.
We covered Financial Reports and how these reports are produced. With these 
Financial Reports, we produced a summary report with all of the available financial 
data in a certain accounting period. For specific analysis, we saw how to create a 
summary of reports for a specific product and business partner.
At the end of this chapter, we covered another feature wherein ADempiere 
can provide light information. This feature is called the Info Window. A lot of 
information can be accessed through the Info Window (which is accessed from 
the View main menu).
At the beginning of an ADempiere implementation, there is a lot of data available 
that needs to be entered into the ADempiere system. This could be lots of products, 
business partners, currency rates, and so on. In the next chapter, we will show you 
how to import this data in to the ADempiere system, by using the import feature.

Importing Data
During the implementation of, or migration to, a new ERP system such as 
ADempiere, there will be existing data that will need to be entered into ADempiere. 
This existing data can be entered item-wise, one-by-one. Entering a small amount 
of data would not be a problem, but when working with a large amount of data, the 
process is time-consuming and error-prone. Recovering from incomplete data will be 
an exhausting and costly affair. We need effective and efficient ways to input such 
data into the system.
By default, ADempiere provides us with an import feature. Before we proceed to the 
import processes, we will discuss the following:
Import Loader Format
Import File Loader
After understanding these features, we will continue on to practicing how to import 
data, which includes importing:
Business Partners
Products
Currency Rates
GL Journal entries
Orders (both Purchase Order and Sales Order)
Invoices (both Invoice (Vendor) and Invoice (Customer))
Inventory
Statements
We will start by discussing how ADempiere's import mechanism 
functions internally.

Importing Data
[ 370 ]
ADempiere's import mechanism
To speed up data entry, we often find that some people use Structured Query 
Language (SQL) to enable direct Data Manipulation Language (DML) to inject 
information directly into ADempiere databases (this is not a healthy practice!). This 
method does not include validation of data, or data integrity checking. It is advisable 
to perform data import using ADempiere's import features.
ADempiere has a methodology to accomplish data import. This is as follows:
First, we need to configure a template that will read and capture data 
through the Import Loader Format window. To do so, we prepare a 
columnar format of template, which is flexible. To fulfill our needs, 
we can add, alter, or amend a column at any point in time.
Continuing this activity, we need to prepare text file data sources that 
comply with the pre-configured Import Loader Format template.
Next, we load the text file data sources into the system.
Finally, we execute the import procedure. ADempiere will check and validate 
data at this stage. If the data has not passed the data integrity test, then the 
system will display a message, and we can take action accordingly.
We will work with this standard approach and show you the details later.
Determining the Import Loader Format
Prior to learning about import processes, we need to know what kind of information 
can be processed and supported by ADempiere's import feature. We can use the 
Import Loader Format window to know about the available structure or template 
(including table and column) that can be used for importing.
In the current version of ADempiere, we find the following Imported Table Format 
methods that can be used for importing:
I_BankStatement, a mediator table for importing bank statements
I_BPartner, a mediator table for importing business partners
I_Conversion_Rate, a mediator table for importing exchange rates
I_ElementValue, a mediator table for importing accounts
I_GLJournal, a mediator table for importing GL journals
I_InOutLineConfirm, a mediator table for importing shipped or 
receipt confirmations
I_Inventory, a mediator table for importing inventories (including 
physical inventory)

I_Invoice, a mediator table for importing invoices
I_Order, a mediator table for importing orders
I_Payment, a mediator table for importing payments
I_Product, a mediator table for importing products
I_ReportLine, a mediator table for importing report line sets
We log in with the user ID admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as a role 
and Shirt as the organization. To see this list of tables, we can:
1.	 Navigate to the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import 
Loader Format window. This window contains two tabs: Import Format 
and Format Field.
2.	 On the Import Format tab, click on the New button, and jump to the Table 
field. There is a list of tables available, as shown in the following screenshot:
This Import Format tab is aimed at defining:
The Imported Table Format (for example, I_BPartner for importing business 
partner). We can define this table in the Table field.
The format of source data in a text file, which includes comma separation, 
fixed positioning, or tab separation to distinguish an element of information. 
This format can be defined in the Format field.
Each of the Imported Table Formats contain a predefined column that can be used 
to store information.

Importing Data
[ 372 ]
For example, we can use I_BPartner Imported Table Format to import customer, 
vendor, or employee information. This table has a collection of columns that could 
be used to capture any type of information. To see this collection of columns, 
you can:
1.	 Set information in the Name field (for example, Test Import Business Partner).
2.	 Select the I_BPartner_Import Business Partner in the Table field.
3.	 Set the Format type (for example, Comma Separated).
4.	 Click on the Save button.
Now, navigate to the Format Field tab in this window. We click on the Column field 
to display information, as shown below:
As we scroll down through the option list, we can see that I_BPartner table contains 
nearly 44 options that can be used to set information!
Summarizing the Format Field tab, it is aimed at defining a list of columns that 
are needed to capture information, set a data type, and define the position of this 
information. We can pick either all, or parts, of the available predefined columns 
for the import process.
We can create a list of the most needed columns. Through the 
subsequent sections, we will learn how to set up most columns 
used when importing data.

Chapter 11
[ 373 ]
Once we have defined the table and column as per our requirements, we can use and 
reuse this preconfigured Import Loader Format for your importing activities.
Preparing the data source
Once we define the Import Loader Format templates, we can then prepare our 
source text data files. We store the data in a simple-to-read format (such as 
comma-separated values (CSV file)), based on the Import Loader Format structure.
When preparing the text file data source for documents such as GL journal, Order, 
Invoices, Inventory, and Bank Statement, we have the opportunity to provide the 
Accounting Date, Movement Date, or Effective Date information. When entering 
these dates, we need to check whether the date is outside the permitted date range, 
and whether or not it's in the ADempiere active period. For example, while the active 
accounting period is December 2009, we cannot create a GL journal document with 
an Accounting Date before or after December 2009.
Loading data with the Import File Loader
With the available data sources, we need to load the data. On completion, the system 
places the data into the relevant Imported Table Format.
We can use the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import File Loader 
window to load the data. At this stage, it loads the data and places it into the relevant 
import table.
Import activities
Once the data is available in the internal ADempiere import table, we will process 
it. All we need to do is click on a button to execute the import task. We don't need 
to worry about the type of button being clicked at this point of time.
When executing this task, ADempiere will:
Verify and validate the data
Create default data for other values (related to this data) based on the 
provided data
Transfer the data to the correct target table. One example of a target table, 
when importing business partner information, is C_BPartner
•
•
•

Importing Data
[ 374 ]
If there are some errors when validating the data, the system displays a message 
in the Import Error Message field. Accordingly, we can take action based on the 
information provided, and continue to re-import the data.
In the following section, we will learn how to import the Business Partner information.
Import the Business Partner information
To import Business Partner information, we need to perform the following tasks:
Creating the BPartner Import Loader Format
Here, we create a structure and declare .csv files as data sources in the Import 
Loader Format window. We add and save the following information in the 
Import Format tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Import BPartner.
3.	 Set the Table field to I_BPartner (shown as I_BPartner_Import Business 
Partner in the option).
4.	 Set the Format field to Comma Separated.
Next, we proceed to the Format Field tab. The I_BPartner table contains 44 columns 
that can be used to construct an import structure. You can see all of the available 
column options in the Column tab.
Here, we can see the nine most commonly-used columns for importing the Business 
Partner purposes. We can add and save this information.

In Sequence 90, when loading the data sources, the system automatically 
defines the Organization information as a constant, with a value 
of 0. This means that all business partners should be set up using * 
organization as a default. Thus, this data could be accessible to all of the 
available organizations.
Preparing the Business Partner data files
We need to create sample data, based on our Import Loader Format definition. As 
per the Import BPartner structure or configuration, we will need to set up eight 
elements of information from a total of nine registered elements. We don't need to 
set up Organization information. According to the Import BPartner structure, it 
will be inserted automatically by the system.
While entering data, we should follow the Start No sequence. In our Import 
BPartner structure, 1 should be occupied with the Search Key information, 2 
should be occupied with the Name, and so on.
We open our editor (Notepad, ConTEXT, vi, or anything else). Add and save the 
following information (without spaces between a comma and the next element):
Andi Store,Andi Book Store,Sudirman street,Kab. Ungaran,ID,Andi,
andi@gmail.com,1000002
Dewa Stationery,Dewa Book Store,Patimura street,Kab. 
Ungaran,ID,Budi,budi@gmail.com,1000002
For example, we can name this file sample_bpartner.csv, and save it as 
C:\sample_bpartner.csv.
•
•

Importing Data
[ 376 ]
We can prepare the data using Microsoft Excel or Open Office SCalc, 
and save it as Text CSV (.csv) file format.
In this example, 1000002 is a record ID (taken from Record Info) for the Local 
business partner group in the author's ADempiere installation. We can refer to the 
More on Record Info section of Chapter 2, Exploring the ADempiere Client and how 
to Perform Tasks, to learn more about record IDs.
Loading the Business Partner data
We need to load the C:\sample_bpartner.csv sample data. Based on the Import 
BPartner configuration, this data will be loaded into our I_BPartner Imported 
Table Format.
We open the Import File Loader window. In this window, we:
1.	 Click on the <Select File to Load> button, and browse to the 
C:\sample_bpartner.csv files.
2.	 In the drop-down list next to the button, we select UTF-8.
3.	 Set the Import Format field to Import BPartner.
We'll finalize everything by clicking on OK. Upon completion, a message will be 
displayed, which contains information such as Rows in file / loaded and ready to 
import : 2 / 2#.

Chapter 11
[ 377 ]
Importing the Business Partner data
Now, we need to import data from I_BPartner; the system will verify and validate 
the data, and set it into a proper table. We'll open the Menu | System Admin | Data 
| Data Import | Import Business Partner window.
This window will contain two records, for further processing. We'll click on the 
Import Business Partner button. In the upcoming confirmation window, we'll click 
on the OK button. Upon importing successfully, a confirmation message such as 2 
Business Partner: Inserted will be displayed. The Business Partner window can be 
checked to verify the imported Business Partner information.
By default, those two Business Partner records will contain the following information:
Flag Prospect checkbox selected (on the Business Partner tab)
Flag Customer checkbox selected (on the Customer tab)
Flag Vendor checkbox deselected (on the Vendor tab)
Flag Employee checkbox deselected (on the Employee tab)
At the time of import, we included a contact name and e-mail ID. 
With this existing information, ADempiere inserts the data in the User 
window automatically.
Import Error Message sample
While entering data in the data sources, sometimes we supply incorrect references. 
For example, we may write the country ID for Indonesia as IA, instead of ID. As you 
would already know, the system will reject this record during the import process.
A sample of the message displayed when an incorrect country code is entered, is 
shown in the following screenshot:

Importing Data
[ 378 ]
We need to find the ISO Country Code field in the Import Business Partner 
window, rectify its value, and save our changes. We'll finalize our process by 
clicking on the Import Business Partners button once again, and now the 
Business Partners will be successfully imported.
Importing Products
Similar to importing Business Partners, this procedure also involves four steps, 
which are outlined in the subsequent sections.:
Creating the Product Import Loader Format
In the Import Loader Format window, we add and save the following information 
on the Import Format tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Import Product.
3.	 Set the Table field to I_Product (shown as I_Product_Import Product 
in the option).
4.	 Set the Format field to Comma Separated.
Next, we proceed to the Format Field tab. The I_Product table contains 50 columns 
that can be used to construct an import structure. The available column option can be 
found in the Column tab.
For the purposes of our example of importing Products, we will use the nine most 
commonly-used columns. We can add and save the following information:

With Sequence 90, we define Organization as a constant with a value 
of 0. This means that all products should be set up at the * organization as 
a default, and thus will be accessible to all of the available organizations.
Preparing Product data files
As per the Import Product structure of configuration, we shall have eight elements of 
information. We'll open our editor, and add and then save the following information 
(without spaces between a comma and the next element):
Books,Books,1000000,Item,30,30,30,1000001
Pencil,Pencil,1000000,Item,5,5,5,1000001
We'll name this file sample_product.csv, and save it at C:\sample_product.csv.
Here, 1000000 is a Record ID (taken from Record Info) for Standard of 
Product Category, while the last 1000001 is a Record ID (taken from 
Record Info) for Piece of unit of measurement in the author's installation.
Loading Product data
Next, we need to load this C:\sample_product.csv data file. Based on the previous 
Import Product configuration, this data will be loaded into the I_Product imported 
table format.
Navigate to the Import File Loader window. In this window, we:
1.	 Click on <Select File to Load>, and select the C:\sample_product.csv file.
2.	 In the drop-down list next to the button, select UTF-8.
3.	 Set the Import Format field to Import Product.
•

Importing Data
[ 380 ]
Next, we'll finalize the file by clicking on the OK button. Upon completion, ADempiere 
will display the message: Rows in file / loaded and ready to import : 2 / 2#.
Importing Product data
Navigate to the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import Product 
window.
This window contains two records, ready to be imported, by clicking on the Import 
Product button. The Import Product confirmation window will contain important 
information that needs to be set up. Here, we will be able to set up the Price List 
Version information, as shown in the following screenshot:
In this case, we'll select the Purchase PL March version price list, and click on the 
OK button. 
With this information, it is advisable to import a product based on 
Price List Version.
Upon successful completion, the system will show a confirmation message: 
2 Product: Inserted. The Product window can be checked to examine the imported 
product, along with its price. If you have not supplied the List Price, Standard Price, 
and Limit Price information, you need to manually set up this information through 
the Price tab of the Product window.
With the available imported product, and because we did not set up any 
Locator information, we need to define the Warehouse Standard Locator 
information manually.
Importing currency rates
When working with multiple currencies, we need to set up exchange rates, for 
example, IDR against USD. With our existing configuration, we will try to import 
currency rates for the Daily currency type.

Chapter 11
[ 381 ]
Creating the Daily currency rates Import 
Loader Format
In the Import Loader Format window, we'll add and save the following information 
on the Import Format tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Import Daily currency rates.
3.	 Set the Table field to I_Conversion_Rate (shown as I_Conversion_Rate_
Import Conversion Rate in the option).
4.	 Set the Format field to Comma Separated.
Next, we'll proceed to the Format Field tab. The I_Conversion_Rate table contains 
21 columns that can be used to construct an import structure.
In our example, we will use the eight most commonly-used columns to import 
currency rates. We'll add and save the following information:

Importing Data
[ 382 ]
In Sequence 70, we supply Create reciprocal with the default value. 
We don't need to define a value for this column, as we make it 
default to Y (which means Yes).
Identifying Search Key information
We have two options for identifying a record identity during data import 
in ADempiere:
Getting the record identity from Record Info.
Getting the record identity from its Key
We already know about how to identify a record identity via the Record Info. Refer 
to the More on Record Info section of Chapter 2, Exploring the ADempiere Client and How 
to Perform Tasks, to know more about the record identity.
What about knowing an identity from its Key? 
For example, when creating currency rates with the Import Loader Format, one 
column being used is the ConversionTypeValue_Currency Type Key. With this 
information, the system tells us to set a Search Key value of currency conversion 
type when writing in data sources.
In the upcoming example, we will use D as Search Key information to identify 
the Daily currency type. We'll navigate to the Menu | Performance Analysis | 
Accounting Rules | Currency Type window. We will find out the D information, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
•
•

Chapter 11
[ 383 ]
This guidance is applicable to all columns that have Key in their name. For example, 
when using the ProductCategory_Value_Product Category Key column at the time 
of constructing the Import Product structure or configuration, we can find a Search 
Key value from the related products in the Product Category window, and place it 
in our data sources.
Preparing Currency rates data files
We need to define at least six elements of information. We'll open the editor, and 
then add and save the following information (without spaces between a comma 
and the next element):
IDR,USD,D,9970,280709,280709
IDR,USD,D,9975,290709,290709
IDR,USD,D,9990,300709,300709
IDR,USD,D,9920,310709,310709
We'll name this file sample_rates.csv, and save it at C:\sample_rates.csv.
In the author's ADempiere installation, D is a Search Key value 
for the Daily type of Currency Type.
Loading Currency rates data
Next, we'll need to load the C:\sample_rates.csv data file into our 
I_Conversion_Rate Imported Table Format.
We'll open the Import File Loader window, in which we:
1.	 Click on the <Select File to Load>, and navigate to and select the 
C:\sample_rates.csv file.
2.	 In the drop-down list next to the button, select UTF-8.
3.	 Set the Import Format field to Import Daily currency rates.
We'll finalize the definition by clicking on the OK button. Upon completion, 
ADempiere will display a message such as Rows in file / loaded and ready 
to import : 4 / 4#.

Importing Data
[ 384 ]
Importing Currency rates data
We'll navigate to the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import 
Currency Rate window; it will contain four records, which need to be processed. 
We’ll click on the Grid Toggle button to view the details, where we'll find and 
click on the Import Conversion Rate button.
Upon the Import Currency Conversion Rate confirmation, we'll have to set 
the following :
1.	 Set the Client field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd.
2.	 Set the Organization field to *.
3.	 Set the Currency Type field to blank.
4.	 Set the Valid from field to blank.
5.	 Deselect the Create Reciprocal Rate checkbox. We read this information 
based on the default value provided in the import loader format.
6.	 Deselect the Delete old imported records checkbox.
We'll then click on the OK button. Based on our sample data, the message 
8 Conversion Rate: Inserted will be shown. This means that ADempiere successfully 
imported four records and automatically inserted an additional four reciprocal data 
records based on our sample data.
We can check the Menu | Performance Analysis | Accounting Rules | Currency 
Rate window to see imported currency rates data results.
Importing General Ledger journal entries
To speed up our GL journal data entries, ADempiere provides an import GL journal 
feature. Here, we will practice how to perform GL journal import activities.
Creating the GL journal Import Loader Format
In the Import Loader Format window, we'll add and save the following information 
on the Import Format tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Import GL Journal.
3.	 Set the Table field to I_GLJournal (shown as I_GLJournal_Import GL 
Journal in the option).
4.	 Set the Format field to Comma Separated.

Chapter 11
[ 385 ]
Next, we go to the Format Field tab. The I_GLJournal table contains 66 columns that 
can be used to set up our information.
In our case, we'll use the 13 most commonly-used columns for importing GL journal 
examples. We'll add and save the following information:

We'll name this file sample_gljournal.csv, and save it as 
C:\sample_gljournal.csv.
In this example, we tried to insert a journal with the 73100 Account Key (Postage 
Expenses). The first journal entry is for a debit transaction, while the rest (second to 
fifth journal) are for credit transactions.
Loading GL journal data
Next, we'll need to load this C:\sample_gljournal.csv data file into our 
I_GLJournal Imported Table Format.
We'll open Import File Loader window, in which we'll:
1.	 Click on <Select File to Load>, and navigate to and select to the 
C:\sample_gljournal.csv file.
2.	 In the drop-down list next to the button, select UTF-8.
3.	 Set the Import Format field to Import GL Journal.

We'll open the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import GL Journal 
window; this will contain five records, which need to be processed. We'll click on the 
Grid Toggle button to view the details, and then click on the Import Journal button.
Upon the display of the Import Journal confirmation window, we'll need to ensure 
that we complete the following:
1.	 Set the Client field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd.
2.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt (the same org information that was 
supplied in the sample_gljournal.csv).
3.	 Pick and set Accounting Schema to the default one.
4.	 Set the Account Date field to 07/31/2009 (this is the same date as supplied in 
the sample_gljournal.csv).
5.	 Deselect the Only Validate Data checkbox.
6.	 Select the Import only if No Errors checkbox.
7.	 Deselect the Delete old imported records checkbox.
We'll click on the OK button, and if we are successful, then a message will be 
displayed, as shown in the following screenshot:
Next, we can go to the GL Journal window where we will find the imported GL 
journal records. The Batch tab does not contain the Account Date and Period 
information. We'll update this Account Date to 07/31/2009, and then save and 
complete the document.
Import Orders
We could perform data import for both Purchase Order or Sales Order documents. 
In terms of ADempiere, the difference between a Purchase Order and a Sales Order 
documents is the document type and the Is Sales Transaction flags. With this 
requirement, we shall include Is Sales Transaction flags in the Import Loader Format.

Preparing the Purchase Order data files
In this example, we'll insert a Purchase Order document, in which we will set the 
Is Sales Trx set to N.
We'll need to define at least ten elements of information. We'll open our editor, 
add and save the following information (without spaces between a comma and 
the next element):
Andi Store,310709,310709,Books,10,1000001,25,1000001,Purchase Order,N
Andi Store,310709,310709,Pencil,20,1000001,5,1000001,Purchase Order,N
We'll name this file sample_order.csv, and save it as C:\sample_order.csv.
In this case, the first 1000001 is a Record ID (taken from the Record Info) for Purchase 
PL March version, while the second 1000001 is a Record ID for Piece , a unit of 
measurement on the author's computer. 
Loading the purchase order data
Next, we'll need to load the C:\sample_order.csv data file into our I_Order 
imported table format.
We'll open the Import File Loader window, in which we'll:
1.	 Click on the button <Select File to Load> and navigate to and select the 
C:\sample_order.csv files.
2.	 In the drop-down list next to the button, select UTF-8.
3.	 Set the Import Format field to Import Order.
Next, we'll finalize our settings by clicking on the OK button. Upon completion, 
a message similar to: Rows in file / loaded and ready to import : 2 / 2# will 
be displayed.
Importing Purchase Order data
We'll open the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import Order 
window, which contains two records that need to be processed. While you are now 
in the grid mode, click on the Grid Toggle button to view the details, and then click 
on the Import Orders button.

When the Import Orders confirmation window is displayed, we'll ensure that 
we set the following information:
1.	 Set the Client field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd.
2.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt (depends on your requirements).
3.	 Set the Document Action field to Prepare.
We'll click on the OK button, and when successful, a message (shown below) will 
be displayed:
We can view the Purchase Order window, and verify our document there.
Sales Order data import sample
For our reference, we will prepare another sample .csv file, which contains the 
following information:
Liz Claiborne Inc,310709,310709,Shirt,10,1000002,20,1000001,Standard

In this case, 1000002 is a Record ID (taken from the Record Info) for Sales PL March 
version, while 1000001 is a Record ID for Piece, a unit of measurement in the 
author's computer
We can load, import, and examine the Sales Order window for verification.
In this example, we've used the Standard Order document type. 
We could also use other document types, such as Binding Offer or 
Non binding offer.

Importing Invoices
Both, the Invoice (Vendor) and Invoice (Customer) can be imported. Again, the Is 
Sales Trx will indicate the type of document. Here, we should practice creating both 
invoices, based on prior import order data activities.
Creating the Invoices Import Loader Format
In the Import Loader Format window, we'll add and save the following information 
on the Import Format tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Import Invoices.
3.	 Set the Table field to I_Invoice (shown I_Invoice_Import Invoice in 
the option).
4.	 Set the Format field to Comma Separated.
Next, we jump to the Format Field tab. The I_Invoice table contains 58 columns that 
can be used during construction of the Invoice Import Loader Format.
In this example, we'll use the ten most commonly-used columns:

Preparing Invoice Vendor data files
In this example, we'll try to insert an AP Invoice document, which has Is Sales Trx 
set to N.
We need to define ten elements of information. We'll open our editor, and add the 
following information (without spaces between a comma and the next element):
Andi Store,AP Invoice,100020,100,310709,310709,Books,10,25,N
Andi Store,AP Invoice,100020,100,310709,310709,Pencil,20,5,N
We can name this file sample_invoices.csv, and save it as 
C:\sample_invoices.csv.
In this case, 100 is a Record ID (taken from Record Info) for USD currency, on the 
author's computer.
Loading Invoice Vendor data
We'll need to load the C:\sample_invoices.csv data file into our I_Invoice 
Imported Table Format.
We'll open the Import File Loader window, in which we'll:
1.	 Click on the button <Select File to Load>, and navigate to and select the 
C:\sample_invoices.csv file.
2.	 In the drop-down list next to the button, select UTF-8.
3.	 Set the Import Format field to Import Invoices.
Then, we'll finalize our settings by clicking on the OK button. Upon completion, the 
message Rows in file / loaded and ready to import : 2 / 2# will be displayed.

1.	 Set the Client field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd.
2.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt (as per our requirements).
3.	 Set the Document Action field to Prepare.
We'll click on OK, and upon successful completion, the following message will 
be shown:
We can view the Invoice (Vendor) window to examine the import results.
Invoice Customer data import sample
For our exercise, we will prepare another sample .csv file, which contains the 
following information:
Liz Claiborne Inc,AR Invoice,100010,100,310709,310709,Shirt,10,20,Y
Liz Claiborne Inc,AR Invoice,100010,100,310709,310709,Shirt,15,20,Y
Liz Claiborne Inc,AR Invoice,100010,100,310709,310709,Shirt,20,20,Y
We can load, import, and examine the results in the Invoice (Customer) window.
The Invoice import is handy for recurring overhead invoices that are similar every 
month. We just need to create a .csv file with various business partners and values, 
and then import this data once a month.

Importing Inventory
At the end of the month, we can perform a physical stock check and then book this 
transaction in the Physical Inventory window. To speed up the entry process, we 
can use the Import Inventory feature.
As mentioned in the Stock counting and reconciliation section of Chapter 8, Managing 
Inventory, when utilizing Physical Inventory activities, we have two options for 
Inventory Type: Inventory Difference and Charge Account. Unfortunately, this 
Import Inventory feature is applicable only to the Inventory Difference option of 
Inventory Type. We cannot use the Charge Account option of Inventory Type here.
Creating the Inventory Import Loader Format
In the Import Loader Format window, we'll add the following information in the 
Import Format tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Import Inventory.
3.	 Set the Table field to I_Inventory (it will appear as I_Inventory_Import 
Inventory in the option).
4.	 Set the Format field to Comma Separated.
Next, we move on to the Format Field tab. The I_Inventory table contains 
27 columns that can be used to construct the Import Loader Format.
For our testing purposes, we use five of the most commonly-used columns:

Preparing Inventory data files
Based on the Import Loader Format definition, we need to define five elements 
of information. We'll open our editor and add the following information (without 
spaces between a comma and the next element):
1st Shirt W/h,Loc S1A,Books,310709,20
1st Shirt W/h,Loc S1A,Pencil,310709,30
We'll name the file sample_inventory.csv, and save it as 
C:\sample_inventory.csv.
Loading Inventory data
We need to load this C:\sample_inventory.csv data file into our I_Inventory 
imported table format.
We'll open the Import File Loader window, in which we'll:
1.	 Click on the button <Select File to Load>, and direct it to the 
C:\sample_inventory.csv file.
2.	 In the drop-down list next to the button, select UTF-8.
3.	 Set the Import Format field to Import Inventory.
We'll then finalize our settings by pressing OK. Upon completion, the message Rows 
in file / loaded and ready to import : 2 / 2# will be displayed.
Importing Inventory data
Upon navigating to the Menu | System Admin | Data | Data Import | Import 
Inventory window, we'll see that it contains two records that need to be processed. 
For this, we'll click on the Grid Toggle button to view the details, where we'll click 
on the Import Inventory button.
Upon confirmation of the Import Invoice, we'll need to ensure that we set:
1.	 Set the Client field to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd.
2.	 Set the Organization field to Shirt (depending on our requirement; this 
should be the same value as specified in sample_inventory.csv).
3.	 Set the Locator field to Loc S1A.
4.	 Set the Movement Date field to today's date.
•

As we already provide Locator and Movement Date information in the 
sample_inventory.csv files, the system should use a value taken 
from this file.
We'll press OK, and upon successful completion, the following message is displayed:
We can check the Physical Inventory window to examine the imported 
inventory data.
Importing a Bank Statement
If there are e-banking facilities available, we can get our bank statement online 
through websites. Unfortunately, with the default files provided, we generally 
cannot use this file directly as a data source. It still needs some touch-up and 
re-formatting the file to fulfill the Import Loader Format configuration, and only then 
can we import this data through ADempiere Bank Statement import. In this section, 
we will create a data source that complies with the Import Loader Format.
For our example, we will practice importing a bank statement that is targeted to a 
certain currency of the bank account.
Creating the Bank Statement Import Loader 
Format
In the Import Loader Format window, we'll add and save the following information 
on the Import Format tab:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Name field to Import Bank Statement for 1-001-888888.
3.	 Set the Table field to I_BankStatement (shown as I_BankStatement_Import 
Bank Statement in the option).
4.	 Set the Format field to Comma Separated.

complete the transaction.
Summary
In this chapter, we learned to perform most of the data import activities. We 
completed four common tasks. The first one was creating the Import Loader 
Format file. We did that just once, and this can be used for further transactions. 
Secondly, we prepared source text files based on the predefined Import Loader 
Format file. Then we learned about loading the data into the ADempiere Imported 
Table Format. Lastly, we moved the import data in its own windows (verifying and 
validating data).
During the creation of the Import Loader Format, we chose which import table 
was to be used, and defined the format for the source files. This was either comma 
separated, fixed positioned, or tab separated. We also defined what type of 
information is needed in the Format Field tab. We defined a list of columns 
required during the data import processes.
When setting up information in the Format Field tab, we can define both constant 
and variable information. For variable information, we can set date, string, or 
numeric data types.
Moving on, with the pre-formatted data available, we loaded it using the Import 
File Loader. We combined and matched information in source files with the target 
import format. We ensured that the load process was successful by examining the 
load confirmation messages.
Finally, we concluded this chapter by performing import activities. During this 
procedure, ADempiere took care of verifying and validating data.
So far in this book, we have had a basic knowledge of the implementation of 
ADempiere. With all of the basics clear, we need to plan and implement the security 
of our ADempiere installation, which we'll learn about in the next chapter.


Implementing Security
So far in this book, almost all of our practical sessions used the user ID admin. With 
this user ID, we can perform activities such as creating an organization, registering 
and/or altering master data (such as business partner and products), configuring 
and watching accounting information, performing production activities, and so on.
In a real ERP implementation, there are many people (such as the General Manager, 
Accounting Manager, Warehouse Manager, Accounting staff, warehouse staff, 
shipping staff, and so on) involved in operating the system. Because every individual 
has his or her own responsibilities in the organization, the system should help the 
organization manage the access rights to information and perform activities in 
the system.
In this chapter, we will introduce you to what we can do to implement ADempiere 
security in your organization. We will discuss how to:
Set up Users
Create Roles and give access rights to end-users
Record Access security rules
We will elaborate on these topics in the upcoming sections.
Managing ADempiere user IDs
In our ADempiere implementation, we need to define a list of users in the system. A 
user could be the Accounting Manager, the Warehouse Manager, or any of the staff 
who need to access the system. Now, log in with user ID admin, using Sistematika 
Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role and * as the organization. We will register a new 
user ID with the help of the ADempiere administrator.
•

Implementing Security
[ 402 ]
Creating a user ID in the system
In this example, we will create two additional user IDs. Open the Menu | System 
Admin | General Rules | Security | User window. On the User Contact tab, enter 
and save the following minimum requirement information:
Field
1st data
2nd data
Client
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd
Sistematika Fashion. Ltd
Organization
*
*
Name
Daniel
Moses
Search Key
daniel
moses
Password
123456
123456
An example of the first set of user ID data entered in the User window is shown in 
the following screenshot:
As these user IDs are not yet connected to any Role, they cannot currently access the 
ADempiere system.
There are other tabs listed in the User window (for example, User Roles, 
User Substitute, Org Assignment, and so on). For our purpose, there is 
no need to set up any data here.

Chapter 12
[ 403 ]
Managing user ID access control
For a computer system's security, role-based access control is an approach to 
restricting system access to authorized users. ADempiere uses this role-based 
access control approach for its internal security implementation.
In the subsequent sections, we will introduce you to creating and configuring 
role-based access control in the ADempiere system.
Introduction to ADempiere roles
The ADempiere role is the place where we can define and configure the access rights 
for our authorized user ID. These access rights include access to:
Organization
Window
Process
Form
Workflow
Task
Document Action
In our example, we will create two roles, which have the following behavior:
The first role will have all access rights
The second role will have restricted or limited rights
We will practice creating these sample roles and examine the impact of the 
security configuration.
Creating a new ADempiere role
Open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Security | Role window, and 
then enter and save the following minimum requirements information on the Role tab:
Field
1st data
2nd data
Client
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd

For the All Access role, select all of the checkboxes in the Allow Info in Role 
fields group.
An example for the information in the Role tab for All Access is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 12
[ 405 ]
On saving the All Access role (which has the Manual checkbox deselected), 
the Window Access, Process Access, Form Access, Workflow Access, Task 
Access, and Document Action Access will be granted automatically, based 
on User Level selection. Check it out in all of the available tabs in this Role 
window. This role has almost identical access rights when compared to the 
default Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin role.
Attaching a user ID to a specific role
With our newly-created role, you need to assign a user ID to this role. Perform the 
following activities:
1.	 Assign user ID Daniel to the All Access role. 
Ensure that your active record in the Role tab of the Role window is All 
Access. Navigate to the User Assignment tab, and then click on the New 
button. Set the Organization to *,  and the User/Contact field to Daniel, 
and then save this information.
2.	 Assign user ID Moses to the Restricted Access role. 
Ensure that your active record in the Role tab of Role window is Restricted 
Access. Navigate to the User Assignment tab, and then click on the New 
button. Set the Organization to *, and the User/Contact field to Moses, and 
then save this information.
With this configuration, user ID Daniel will be able to log in to the system 
and work in all of the available organizations. Organization assignment is 
automatically provided for the All Access role because, it has the Access all 
Orgs checkbox selected.
Assigning organization access to a user ID
Unfortunately, although user ID Moses has already been assigned to the Restricted 
Access role, he will still not able to access and log in to the system. This is because 
the Restricted Access role has the Access all Orgs checkbox deselected.
With this configuration, we need to manually assign organization access to this 
role. For our example, we will assign the Shirt and Dress organization to this role. 
Perform the following tasks:
Be sure that your active record in the Role tab of Role window is Restricted 
Access. Navigate to the Org Access tab, set the Organization to Shirt, and 
then click on the Save button.
While still on the Org Access tab, click on the New button, set the 
Organization to Dress, and finalize the task by clicking on the Save button.
•

Implementing Security
[ 406 ]
The result is shown in the following screenshot:
Now, user ID Moses will be able to log in and access the system.
Working with the Access all Orgs option
If the Access all Orgs option is selected, your user ID will be able to access all of the 
organizations available in the client. If this option deselected, you have two options 
for assigning organization access to a certain user ID:
Select the Use User Org Access checkbox. This option will appear if you 
deselect the Access all Orgs option. You need to register the organization 
access through the Org Access tab in the User window.
If the Use User Org Access checkbox is deselected, you can register an 
organization through the Org Access tab in the Role window.
Working with the Maintain Change Log option
As mentioned in the Maintaining a log of data changes and More on Record Info 
sections of Chapter 2, Exploring the ADempiere Client and Performing Tasks with 
the Maintain Change Log option enabled, the system will show the history of 
changes to our data.
To see the history of the data changes, launch another ADempiere client, log in 
with user ID Daniel, password 123456, using All Access as a role, and Shirt as 
organization. As this feature is enabled for all of the available ADempiere windows, 
we can practice by working in the Product window. Open this window and find the 
Standard product. For this product, perform the following activities:
•

Change the UPC/EAN field to UPC-STD, and click on the Save button
Once again, change the UPC/EAN field to UPC-STD001, and click on the 
Save button
Now, click on Record Info in this window. This will show you the information 
shown in the following screenshot:
Working with the Show accounting option
With this option selected (along with having the Show Accounting Tabs option 
in Tools | Preference selected), you will be able to read, modify, and execute 
processes related to accounting. If this option is deselected, you will not be able to:
Access accounting facts/GL journal entries in any of the ADempiere 
documents such as MM Receipt, AR Invoice, and so on. The Posted 
or Not Posted button will not available in all of the documents.
Access windows related to accounting (such as Accounting Fact Details, 
Account Combination, Account Element, GL Journal window, and so on).
Access accounting configuration (such as the Accounting tab of Product, 
Business Partner, Cashbook, Bank window, and so on).
The last two types of access are basically configurable. When registering the tab as 
part of constructing the window in the Window, Tab & Field window, the tab has 
Accounting Tab attributes. With these attributes, you can define whether or not 
this tab will show information related to Accounting.

To unveil this configuration, launch another ADempiere client, and log in with user 
ID System, password System, and the role System Administrator. Open the Menu | 
Application Dictionary | Window, Tab & Field window. In the upcoming Lookup 
Record window (search dialog window), enter Accounting Fact Details in the Name 
field and click on the OK button. In the Accounting Fact Details record, navigate to 
the Tab tab. You will see that the Accounting Tab checkbox is selected, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
With this configuration, and while the Show Accounting checkbox is deselected for 
your role, you will not be able to access this tab. Because this is the only tab available 
in the Accounting Fact Details window, you cannot access the window. Try to access 
this window by using user ID user and Sistematika Fashion, Ltd User as the role. 
The system will display a message such as With your current role and settings, 
you cannot view this information. Now, log off from user ID System.
Working with the Can Report option
As a default, the Can Report option is selected. With this option, you can generate a 
report by clicking on the Report button for any window that has the reports feature. 
If this option is deselected, you cannot generate a report for these windows. Refer 
to the Accessing the Report button section in the Chapter 10, Reporting Management, 
for details of how to create reports.

Chapter 12
[ 409 ]
If the Can Report option is deselected, the user ID that is connected using this role will 
get the following error message while creating reports:
Working with the Can Export option
After print previewing our reports using the Print preview or Print button, if the 
Can Export option is selected, we will be able to export our reports into various file 
formats (such as, XLS, PDF, and so on). Refer to the Sending e-mail, archiving reports, 
and export section in Chapter 10, Reporting Management, for the button related to 
export activity.
If this option is deselected, the Export button will not be available. Therefore, you 
cannot export your reports.
Accessing Info Window
As already mentioned in the Info window section of Chapter 10, Reporting 
Management, ADempiere provides us with real-time information to assess product, 
business partner, account information, and so on. You will be able to control the 
availability of this information by selecting or deselecting the corresponding Info 
window in the Role tab of the Role window, as shown in the following screenshot:
For example, if you deselect the Allow Info BPartner checkbox, the Business Partner 
Info will disappear from the View menu.

Implementing Security
[ 410 ]
Assigning Window Access
As described in the Assigning organization access to user ID section, user ID Moses will 
be able to log in, select Restricted Access as a Role and Shirt as the Organization to 
work in this environment. He can then start working with the available window.
"Available window? There is no window available in the main menu. I can not see 
any window after logging in!"
Yes, there is no window available while accessing the system by using the Restricted 
Access role. We have not yet registered the list of windows in the Window Access 
tab. In our example, we will register two windows for this role: Purchase Order 
and Material Receipt. This user ID then will have the rights to perform activities 
in both of these windows.
Ensure that you are in the Restricted Access record in the Role tab of the Role 
window. Navigate to the Window Access tab, and then enter and save the 
following information:

With a successful log in, you will see a menu such as the one shown in the 
following screenshot:
For the subsequent section, we need to enter sample Purchase Order data. 
Open the Purchase Order window, and in the Purchase Order tab, and then 
enter and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Target Document Type field to Purchase Order
2.	 Set the Business Partner field to Hempel China Limited
3.	 Set the Price List field to Purchase PL
4.	 Set the Company Agent field to user

[ 411 ]
Leave the other fields unchanged. Navigate to the PO Line tab, and then enter and 
save the following information:
1.	 Set the Product field to S Fabric
2.	 Set the Quantity field to 100
Leave the other fields unchanged. Now, click on the Print preview button. It will 
perform nothing!
Identifying Process Access
Do you mean that user ID Moses, when connected using the Restricted Access role 
cannot make a print of this document?
With the existing Restricted Access role configuration, the role does not have access 
rights to perform a purchase document print or print preview.
On launching your ADempiere client by using Run_Adempiere.bat when working 
with the Microsoft Windows operating system, there will be a small DOS prompt 
window created by default. This will contain a message such as the one shown in 
the following screenshot:
 
The system tells us that we Cannot access Process 110 with role: Restricted Access.
What is process 110?
To answer this question, we need to access the internal ADempiere configuration. 
Use the following procedure:
1.	 Launch another ADempiere client, and log in with the user ID System, 
password System, and System Administrator as the role.
2.	 Open the Menu | Application Dictionary | Report & Process window.

Implementing Security
[ 412 ]
3.	 In the upcoming Lookup Record (search dialog) window, navigate to the 
Advanced tab, and set the Column to Process (ID), the Operator to =, and 
the Query Value to 110, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the OK button.
4.	 After performing the above activities, you will be directed to a process 
having an identity of 110, which is a record that has Rpt_C_Order as 
its Search Key and Order Print as its process Name, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
5.	 Now, log out from this ADempiere client.
With this information, we can register this process to the Restricted Access role. 
Registering Process Access
In the available ADempiere client, log in with the user ID admin and Sistematika 
Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, and then open your Role window. In the Role tab, 
ensure that your active record is Restricted Access.

The second piece of information is to allow a user ID that is 
connected with the Restricted Access role, to print or print preview 
the document in the Material Receipt window.
Now, re-login with the user ID Moses and password 123456. Open the Purchase 
Order window and you can then print or print preview a document in this window.
Next, you can try to Complete this document. Again, it does nothing! No problem, 
we will show you how to allow user ID Moses to complete this document, in the 
subsequent sections.
Introduction to Document Action Access
In all of the ADempiere documents, such as Purchase Order, MM Receipt, AR Receipt, 
AP Payment, and so on, we can perform some actions for them. The standard actions 
available in the ADempiere system are listed (in alphabetical order) below:

These two document actions are used as a standard action when 
determining a document workflow. Refer to the Activity/Node flow section 
in Chapter 9, ADempiere Workflow, for more information. The Prepare 
action is used in the (DocPrepare) node, whereas Complete is used in the 
(DocComplete) node.
Registering Document Action Access
Here, we need to assign both Prepare and Complete document access for both the 
Purchase Order and MM Receipt documents to the Restricted Access role. With 
the available ADempiere client that is connected to user ID admin, and using 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, you can open your Role window. 
In the Role tab, ensure that your active record is Restricted Access.

shown in the following screenshot:
Select Complete from the list, and then click on the OK button to finalize this activity.
Managing Form Access
If we need to grant the Restricted Access role to perform the import data activity, 
we could grant the Import File Loader form to this role. Using the existing user 
ID admin and the Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin role, you can open your Role 
window. On the Role tab, ensure that your active record is Restricted Access.
Navigate to the Form Access tab, and then enter and save the following information:
1.	 Set the Organization field to *.
2.	 Set the Special Form field to Import File Loader.
3.	 Select the Read Write checkbox.
On re-logging in with user ID Moses and password 123456, the list of available 
menus should be as shown in the following screenshot:
Related to the Import File Loader window, as explained in the Chapter 11, 
Importing Data, you need to add an access right to a certain import window 
(for example, Import Product, Import Inventory, and so on) to this role. You 
can access the Window Access tab and register this window there.

Recording access security rules
Currently, with our configuration, there are two warehouses available in the Dress 
organization. These are:
1st Dress W/h
2nd Dress W/h
By default, all users that have access rights to the Dress organization will be free to 
access these warehouses.
Do we have a requirement that allows just user Moses to access 2nd Dress W/h 
only? Is that possible?
ADempiere has a feature to block users from accessing information in certain 
records. With this feature, the locking process is applied based on a Role, and 
not on a certain user ID.
Enabling Personal Lock
There are some prerequisite activities required in order to be able to block access to 
certain records. This activity defines which Role has the rights to block access.
In our example, we will give the default Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin role 
this right. Log in with user ID admin, select Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the 
role. Open the Role window, and access the Role tab. Point your active records 
to Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin, and then find and select the Personal Lock 
checkbox, as shown in the following screenshot:
On enabling the personal lock, if you are logged in as user ID admin have 
Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as an active Role, on opening all of the ADempiere 
windows, there will be an additional special Private Record Lock toolbar available, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
•
•

Chapter 12
[ 417 ]
Blocking access to certain records
With the previous requirement, we will block the user ID (which connects with the 
Restricted Access role) from accessing the 1st Dress W/h warehouse.
This be done by using the following procedure:
1.	 Open the Menu | Material Management | Material Management Rules | 
Warehouse & Locators window. 
2.	 In the Warehouse tab, find your 1st Dress W/h record. Press the Ctrl key, and 
then click on the Private Record Lock button at the same time. 
3.	 In the upcoming Record Access Dialog confirmation window, set the 
following information:
Set the Role field to Restricted Access (pick from the 
options available)
Select the Active checkbox
Select the Exclude checkbox
The following screenshot shows the completed window:
Finalize the process by clicking on the OK button.
Log in with user ID Moses and password 123456, using Restricted Access as the 
role, and Dress as the organization. Open the Purchase Order window, and try to 
create a new document. Take a closer look at the available options in the Warehouse 
field. Now, it will only list 2nd Dress W/h, as shown in the following screenshot:

Restoring access to certain blocked records
There are two way to restore user rights to certain blocked records.
First, if you know the blocked records and the Role to which these records are 
blocked (in our case, 1st Dress W/h with Restricted Access), then you can open the 
Warehouse & Locators window, find your 1st Dress W/h record, press the Ctrl key, 
and then click on the Private Record Lock button. In the upcoming Record Access 
Dialog confirmation window, make sure that you set the Role to Restricted Access, 
and then click on the Delete record button.
The Delete record button is a green recycle button on the right-hand 
side of the Dependent Entities checkbox.
Second, you can open the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Security | Role 
Data Access window. Select the role that needs to be maintained in the Role tab. In 
our case, this is the Restricted Access role.
Navigate to the Record Access tab. This tab will contain all of the record restriction 
configuration. This is a sample record format, which contains blocking information 
for certain records, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the Record ID button, to check what kind of record information is currently 
blocked. On confirmation, you can press the F3 key to delete this record, and the 
access rights to this information will be restored.
Using Dependent Entities
With the previous record access lock activity, the user who was connected to the 
ADempiere system using Restricted Access role could not use the 1st Dress 
W/h as their target warehouse when working with a new document (such as, 
Purchase Order, Material Receipt, and so on). They will still be able to access 
any existing document that uses 1st Dress W/h as part of their warehouse 
information references.

Chapter 12
[ 419 ]
If you need to hide or restrict access to any document that has 1st Dress W/h as part 
of its document information, you can select the Dependent Entities checkbox.
Working with Role Data Access in detail
In the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Security | Role Data Access 
window, we can define an access right on both the ADempiere database table 
and column, which is registered in the ADempiere Application Dictionary. We 
will elaborate on a sample use of this data access in the subsequent sections.
Restricting Table access
Suppose that you need to grant access to a role that can only read or view the 
Material Receipt window and cannot add or alter any information in this window. 
With User ID admin and using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role, you 
need to perform the following steps:
1.	 Find the document's target table. You can get this information by opening the 
Material Receipt window and clicking on Record Info. In this case, the table 
name is M_InOut.
2.	 Open the Role Data Access window, set your target role (for example, 
Restricted Access) in the Role tab, and then navigate to the Table Access tab. 
Enter and then save the following information:
Set the Table field to M_InOut (on the screen, it will show as 
M_InOut_Shipment/Receipt)
Select the Exclude checkbox
Set the Access Type field to Accessing
Select the Read Only checkbox
With this configuration, if the user is connected to the ADempiere system using 
the Restricted Access role, on opening their Material Receipt window they will 
have read-only access and will not be able to alter or add any information.
Restricting Report access
Refer to the Working with the Can Report option section of this chapter. In this section, 
the option was to be able to create a report, and unfortunately, this configuration 
applies to all of the available windows.
°
°
°
°

Implementing Security
[ 420 ]
With the combination of the Can Report option and restricting report access, we 
have the option to give report access by first authorizing access to all of the available 
reports, and then restricting access to certain selected reports.
We will use this approach. Here, we will show you an example wherein a user ID 
connected using the Restricted Access role will not be able to access only the Material 
Receipt report. For this requirement, using user ID admin and Sistematika Fashion, 
Ltd Admin as the role you need to:
1.	 Access the Role tab in the Role Data Access window. Ensure that your active 
record is Restricted Access.
2.	 On the Role tab, select the Can Report option.
3.	 Navigate to the Table Access tab, add and then enter and save the 
following information:
Set the Table field to M_InOut (on the screen, it will show 
M_InOut_Shipment/Receipt)
Select the Exclude checkbox
Set the Access Type field to Reporting
Deselect the Can Report checkbox (this option will be available 
if the Access Type is set to Reporting)
Restricting Export access
So far, if user ID Moses is connected using the Restricted Access role, he can process 
a report, print preview, or print the Purchase Order data.
°

Chapter 12
[ 421 ]
"Okay, this role has rights to create a report, print preview, or print Purchase 
Order data through the Purchase Order window. For security reasons, could we 
ensure that the user ID connected to the system using the Restricted Access role 
cannot export this report?"
Yes, this is possible with ADempiere. You can achieve this by carrying out the 
following steps:
1.	  Access the Role tab in the Role Data Access window. Ensure that your 
active record is Restricted Access.
2.	 In the Role tab, select the Can Export option.
3.	 Navigate to the Table Access tab, and then enter and save the 
following information:
Set the Table field to C_Order (on the screen, it will show as 
C_Order_Order)
Select the Exclude checkbox
Set the Access Type field to Exporting
Deselect the Can Export checkbox (this option will be available if 
the Access Type is set to Exporting)
If the user is connected to the ADempiere system using the Restricted Access role, 
when making a report and print previewing the document in the Purchase Order 
window, the Export button will not be available.
Restricting Column Access
Well, what we need is just to make sure that this role cannot alter the Purchase 
Order's Date Ordered only. We need anyone who is connected with this role to use 
a default Date Ordered.
If this configuration should be applied to the Restricted Access role, you can do this 
by carrying out the following procedure:
1.	 Identify the table name of the targeted column with the Record Info.
2.	 Open the Role Data Access window, set your targeted role in the Role 
tab, and then go to the Column Access tab. Enter and then save the 
following information:
Set the Table field to C_Order (on the screen, it will show as 
C_Order_Order)
Set the Column field to DateOrdered (on the screen, it will 
show as DateOrdered_Date Ordered)
Select the Exclude and Read Only checkboxes

After these changes, the user ID connected with this role will not be able to alter the 
Date Ordered field. The system sets this field as read-only information, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
If you have not selected the Read Only checkbox field, then this 
Date Ordered field information will completely disappear, or 
will be hidden in the document.
Obscuring information
When working with a system that involves many people, we need to make sure that 
sensitive data, such as the user IDs password information, and financial information 
such as credit-card numbers, are secure.
As an ADempiere standard feature, the system has a mechanism to obscure 
information. We will elaborate on how ADempiere accomplishes this in 
the following sections.
Enabling the encrypted feature
When we interact with the Menu | System Admin | General Rules | Security | User 
window, we can define the user ID information, including the Password. By default, 
the Password field does not show the actual password characters. The information in 
the Password field will be as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 12
[ 423 ]
We will now take a look at the Window, Tab & Field window to understand how 
ADempiere makes this work:
1.	 Log in with user ID System, password System and using System 
Administrator as the Role. Open the Menu | Application Dictionary | 
Window, Tab & Field window. In the upcoming Lookup Record (search 
dialog) window, enter User in the Name field. With this activity, we will 
check the User window configuration.
2.	 In the Window tab, ensure that your active record has User in the Name 
field, and Maintain Users of the system in the Description field.
3.	 Navigate to the Tab tab. As per the default configuration, you are directed to 
the first record of the eight available records in this tab (which are displaying 
User Contact in the Name field).
4.	 Navigate to the Field tab. Here, there are many fields available, which 
construct your User Contact tab. Find your Password record, and click 
on the Grid Toggle button to show the detailed configuration for this 
field. Here, you will have the Encrypted checkbox selected, as shown in 
the following screenshot:

Implementing Security
[ 424 ]
With this configuration, the system tells us that any information entered in this field 
should be encrypted, and you will not be able to see the characters entered.
Deselect the Encrypted checkbox, and save your changes. Log in with the user ID 
admin, using Sistematika Fashion, Ltd Admin as the role. Open the Menu | System 
Admin | General Rules | Security | User window. Select the Password field in the 
User Contact tab. Now in the User Contact tab of the User window, the Password 
field will appear as plain text, as shown in the following screenshot:
Working with the Obscure feature
There is another option for obscuring information. Below the Encrypted checkbox, 
there is an Obscure field available. Here, you can select an option from the four 
available methods, as shown in the following screenshot:
If you select the Obscure AlphaNumeric but last 4 as your option, then the system 
will not obscure the last four characters when entering any data, but will obscure the 
rest. In this case, your admin user ID's Password field will appear as *dmin. You can 
try any of the other available option that suits your needs.
You need deselect the Encrypted checkbox when using the 
Obscure option.

Summary
In this chapter, we have learnt how to implement security in ADempiere. We started 
with a discussion on how to create a new user ID in the system. With the new user 
ID available, we assigned a role.
When creating the role, we explained the important options, such as accessing 
all organizations, maintaining a change log, and showing accounting and other 
available attributes. We continued these activities and saw examples of how to grant 
access to the Info Window, Window, Process Access, Document Action Access, and 
Form Access.
We elaborated on how to restrict access to a certain record, and introduced you to 
table, report, export, and column access configuration. Finally, we showed you how 
ADempiere obscures information.
You now have a basic knowledge of how to implement ADempiere in your 
organization. We encourage you to join the ADempiere community and share your 
experience of using ADempiere on our forum. Visit us at http://www.adempiere.
org and http://www.adempiere.com to learn more. For virtual chat, you can join and 
say hello to the community using Internet Relay Chat (IRC) at irc.freenode.net, 
channel room #adempiere. See you there!

Thank you for buying 
ADempiere 3.4 ERP Solutions
Packt Open Source Project Royalties
When we sell a book written on an Open Source project, we pay a royalty directly to that 
project. Therefore by purchasing ADempiere 3.4 ERP Solutions, Packt will have given some of 
the money received to the ADempiere project.
In the long term, we see ourselves and you—customers and readers of our books—as part of 
the Open Source ecosystem, providing sustainable revenue for the projects we publish on. 
Our aim at Packt is to establish publishing royalties as an essential part of the service and 
support a business model that sustains Open Source.
If you're working with an Open Source project that you would like us to publish on, and 
subsequently pay royalties to, please get in touch with us.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals 
should be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you 
would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.  
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using 
to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have 
seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information,
