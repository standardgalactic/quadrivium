Logic
Logic is the study of information encoded in the form
of logical sentences.
Sacramento is the capital of California.
Boise is not the capital of Utah.
Boise is the capital of Utah or Idaho.
If  Eugene is not the capital of Oregon, then it is Salem.
There is some city that is capital of Hawaii.
Every state has a capital.
Logic in Human Affairs
Language of Logic
Abby likes Bess.
A triangle is a polygon with three sides.
Force equal mass times acceleration.
Logical Reasoning
    to derive conclusions
    to convince others

Possible Worlds
Logical Entailment
A set of premises logically entails a conclusion if and
only if every world that satisfies the premises
satisfies the conclusion.
Premises:
Conclusions:
Dana likes Cody.
        Bess likes Cody.
Abby does not like Dana.
        Bess does not like Dana.
Dana does not like Abby.
        Everybody likes somebody.
Bess likes Cody or Dana.
        Everybody is liked by somebody.
Abby likes everyone that Bess likes.
Cody likes everyone who likes her.
Nobody likes herself.

8
Checking Possible Worlds
Proof
We know that Abby likes everyone that Bess likes, and we
know that Abby does not like Dana. Therefore, Bess must not
like Dana either. (If Bess did like Dana, then Abby would like
her as well.) At the same time, we know that Bess likes Cody
or Dana. Consequently, since Bess does not like Dana, she
must like Cody.

Rules of Inference
A rule of inference is a reasoning pattern consisting
of some premises and some conclusions.
If we believe the premises, a rule of inference tell us
that we should  also believe the conclusions.
Sample Rule of Inference
All Accords are Hondas.
All Hondas are Japanese.
  Therefore, all Accords are Japanese.

10
Sample Rule of Inference
All borogoves are slithy toves.
All slithy toves are mimsy.
  Therefore, all borogoves are mimsy.
Sound Rule of Inference
All x are y.
All y are z.
  Therefore, x are z.
Which patterns are correct?
How many rules do we need?

11
Bad Rule of Inference
All x are y.
Some y are z.
Therefore, some x are z.
Using Bad Rule of Inference
All Toyotas are Japanese cars.
Some Japanese cars are made in America.
Therefore, some Toyotas are made in America.

12
Using Bad Rule of Inference
All Toyotas are cars.
Some cars are Porsches.
Therefore, some Toyotas are Porsches.

Michigan Lease Termination Clause
The University may terminate this lease when the Lessee, having made
application and executed this lease in advance of enrollment, is not
eligible to enroll or fails to enroll in the University or leaves the
University at any time prior to the expiration of this lease, or for violation
of any provisions of this lease, or for violation of any University
regulation relative to resident Halls, or for health reasons, by providing
the student with written notice of this termination 30 days prior to the
effective data of termination; unless life, limb, or property would be
jeopardized, the Lessee engages in the sales of purchase of controlled
substances in violation of federal, state or local law, or the Lessee is no
longer enrolled as a student, or the Lessee engages in the use or
possession of firearms, explosives, inflammable liquids, fireworks, or
other dangerous weapons within the building, or turns in a false alarm, in
which cases a maximum of 24 hours notice would be sufficient.

Reasoning
Champagne is better than beer.
Beer is better than soda.
    Therefore, champagne is better than soda.
Reasoning Error
Champagne is better than beer.
Beer is better than soda.
    Therefore, champagne is better than soda.
Bad sex is better than nothing.
Nothing is better than good sex.
    Therefore, bad sex is better than good sex.

Managers and subordinates may not be office mates.
