About the Author
Howie Jacobson, PhD, has been an Internet marketing strategist since 
1999. He specializes in helping clients use Google AdWords to grow their 
businesses. Because he was forced to study statistical methods in graduate 
school, Jacobson took to direct marketing as soon as he tripped over it in 
2001.
He is the creator of the AdWords Ball, AdWords Checkmate, and Traffi c Surge 
programs. He also runs the Ring of Fire AdWords coaching club.
Jacobson has presented at several System Seminar events, at Perry 
Marshall’s AdWords Seminar, Agora’s Early to Rise conferences, and at 
workshops and seminars around the world. He is a regular contributor to 
HorsesMouth.com, a performance-improvement site for fi nancial advisors, as 
well as a former writer for Vault.com. He leads telephone seminars on begin-
ner and advanced AdWords topics and provides online coaching and support 
at his Web site, www.askhowie.com.
Jacobson also runs www.loweryourbidprice.com, a company that pro-
duces software tools that help AdWords advertisers and AdWords consul-
tants save time, reduce costs, and increase profi ts.
Luckily for you, Jacobson began his career as a schoolteacher. Through trial 
by fi re, he learned how to be engaging, clear, and entertaining while provid-
ing value and motivating results. He is also a business coach and trainer, 
skilled in turning learning into action, helping his own clients and a horde of 
others in association with Bregman Partners, Inc., and The Avoca Group.
Jacobson combines his marketing expertise with his background in and pas-
sion for health and fi tness at FitFam.com, a resource for parents struggling to 
raise fi t and healthy kids in a crazy-busy world. 
He lives in Durham, North Carolina, with his wife, two kids, big, goofy dog, 
and three-legged rat. His lifelong ambition is to bring about world peace 
through marketing — and after that’s accomplished, to play Ultimate Frisbee 
in the 2044 Olympics in Maui.

Dedication
This book is dedicated to the people I annoyed and ignored the most during 
the writing of it: my children, Yael and Elan, and my wife. Mia, I love you 
more than any of my favorite song lyrics can say. Yael, continue to strive for 
justice and keep making the world a more beautiful and unpredictable place. 
Elan, keep growing strong and true, and share your belly laugh and music 
with everyone you meet.
I also dedicate this book to my mother, Lucie Jacobson, whose example 
reminds me to give generously and live big, and the memory of my father, 
Joel R. Jacobson, a courageous man with a kind heart and a great squash serve.
Author’s Acknowledgments
If I were to properly acknowledge on one page all the help I received while 
writing this book, I’d be using Times New Roman 0.01-point font and you’d be 
reading this with an electron microscope.
My wonderful editors at Wiley Publishing: Amy Fandrei, Chris Morris, Brian 
Walls, and Jennifer Riggs. They have been patient with my whining, accepting 
of nothing but my best, and always ready with advice and reassurance. And 
Jim Kelly, tech editor extraordinaire, keeps me honest and entertained at the 
same time.
My technical advisors at Google, Devin Sandoz, Gopi Kallayil, Jason Rose, 
Fred Vallaeys, and Emily Harris, answered my frequent volleys of questions 
with celerity and grace. We haven’t met, but I like to think of them riding 
their Segways from the offi ce to the gourmet lunchrooms at the Googleplex.
Big hugs to the many AdWords experts who shared their wisdom, stories, and 
sometimes, even keywords. Perry Marshall is such a fi ne AdWords teacher, 
business associate, and friend that I wonder what good deeds I performed in my 
previous life to deserve him. Kristie McDonald and David Rothwell are my “ears to 
the ground” AdWords practitioners who always seem to know what Google is up 
to before anybody else. David Bullock and Glenn Livingston shared their best stuff 
with me freely and often — I apologize to their clients and spouses for all the 
time I monopolized while asking them questions. David even agreed, in a moment 
of weakness, to become the technical editor for the fi rst edition of this book. 
Luckily, I asked and he agreed just before he was featured in Black Enterprise 
Magazine and became the most sought-after Taguchi expert in the country.
Sean D’Souza has rocked my world with the quality of his thinking, teaching, 
and heart. He and my coach, Christian Mickelsen, have shown me the way to 
a sustainable, joyous online business.

Timothy Seward, my neighbor in North Carolina, has taught me more about 
Analytics than I thought there was to know. If I’d been paying for his time, he’d 
be retired by now. The fabulous Joy Milkowski shared her methodologies with 
me and helped me rewrite the chapter about creating compelling ads. The 
friendship we developed during this project has been an added bonus. Don 
Crowther, one of the cleverest and under-the-radar marketers on this or any 
other planet, shared more cool ideas with me than I could ever have hoped. And 
Dan Hollings, the man behind the online success of “The Secret,” reached out to 
me in an Amazon.com review of the fi rst edition of AdWords For Dummies and 
has been blowing my mind with his crazy-brilliant online strategies ever since.
Bryan Todd and I have argued and philosophized about metrics more than 
either of us cares to admit. Kelly Muldoon shared her experience with 
geographic targeting and always has the right amount of sympathy and 
chocolate for any situation. Michael Katz, the world’s expert on e-newsletters, 
was so helpful during this project that I almost forgive him for being funnier 
than I am. Joe Chapuis generously shared his knowledge about the cutting 
edge of online video, while Ari Galper enlightened me about the marketing 
potential of live chat and allowed me to reveal his strategies and show his 
screen shots. Thanks also to my many clients who shared case studies with 
me — sorry about all the ones I couldn’t use.
Rob Goyette, Steve Goyette, and Erik Wickstrom were never more than a cell 
phone call away whenever I had a question about PHP, HTML, or the MLB 
MVP. Working with these talented programmers and marketers is like having 
three genie-fi lled lamps.
Elizabeth Edmiston, the other half of my business brain (and that’s an 
understatement), keeps me on track, keeps clients and customers delighted, 
and creates the most amazing software. Head on over to www.magic
adwordsbutton.com if you don’t believe me.
Ken McCarthy is, quite simply, the source. He understood the potential of 
the Internet long before the dot.com craze, and he has been quietly creating 
business leaders and success stories for over 15 years. The combination of 
masterful teacher and brilliant business strategist is a rare one; throw in loyal 
friend and passionate righter of wrongs and you have Ken.
Brad Hill believed in me enough to get this whole adventure in motion, and he 
has encouraged me to become the writer my elementary school teachers always 
said I’d become. Danny Warshay has been a business and life mentor since we 
met as roommates in Jerusalem in 1986. And Peter Bregman gave me my 
introduction to the business world when I was a naïve, befuddled PhD freshly 
minted from grad school. He always encouraged me to ask questions, no 
matter how stupid, and except for that time when I asked the HR Director from 
American Express what exactly she meant by “P&L,” it all worked out. Without 
Peter’s guidance and wicked humor, my life would be unimaginably less rich.

Introduction
M
ost business owners I meet have never heard of Google AdWords. My 
prediction: If you aren’t advertising your business in Google within 
two years, you’re not going to stay in business. The age of the Yellow Pages is 
ending, and online advertising — led by AdWords — is taking over.
For those who take the time to master this new advertising medium, it’s an 
exciting time. AdWords represents a revolution in the advertising world. For 
the first time ever, businesses large and small can show their ads to qualified 
prospects anywhere in the world, when those prospects are hungriest for the 
business’ products and services. AdWords allows fine geographic targeting, 
like a Yellow Pages ad, but (unlike the Yellow Pages) also allows advertisers 
to edit, pause, or delete their Google ads any time they like, in real time.
Unlike a traditional advertisement, Google ads cost money only when they 
are clicked — that is, when a live prospect clicks the ad to visit your site. And 
perhaps most important, AdWords enables advertisers to test multiple ads 
simultaneously and to track the return on investment of every ad and every 
keyword they employ.
Since a click can cost as little as a penny and each click can be tracked to a 
business outcome, even small, cash-strapped businesses can find AdWords 
an effective way to grow without betting the farm on untested marketing 
messages. Google’s ads reach across the entire Internet. In addition to the 200 
million Google searches per day (almost 60 percent of all Internet searches), 
Google provides search results for AOL, EarthLink, Netscape, and other big 
Internet service providers. And through its AdSense program, Google’s ads 
appear on sites all across the Internet — in thousands of newspaper Web 
sites and hundreds of thousands of blogs, as well as on Gmail pages.
Yet few small businesses have ever advertised through AdWords. The pay-per-
click technology, combined with the unfamiliar form of direct-response 
marketing, has so far kept most small businesses away from the potential 
benefits of AdWords. If few businesses are using it, even fewer are using it 
wisely. Marketing executives at large companies have been slow to embrace 
the direct-response model, having been trained in brand advertising that has 
little place in a results-accountable medium like AdWords.

Google AdWords For Dummies, 2nd Edition
About This Book
I’ve consulted with hundreds of AdWords clients over the past several years, 
working with everyone from complete beginners who didn’t know how to 
set up their account to power users spending more than a million dollars 
a month in clicks. Nothing in this book is theoretical — every concept and 
strategy has been tested under fire in some of the most competitive markets 
on Earth. When you play the AdWords game, you don’t have much room to 
spin failure into success. You either make money or lose money, and the 
numbers tell the story.
This book strives to explain clearly, in layperson’s terms, the AdWords 
mechanics and best practices for businesses large and small. You will discover 
how to build smart and elegant campaigns based on an understanding of the 
direct marketing principles.
This book isn’t meant to be read from front to back. (I didn’t even write it 
from front to back.) It’s more like a reference. Each chapter is divided into 
sections, so you can jump in anywhere and find out how to accomplish a 
specific AdWords task.
You don’t have to remember anything in this book. Nothing is worth memo-
rizing, except the mantra, “Thank you, Howie.” The information here is what 
you need to know to create and manage successful AdWords campaigns — 
and nothing more. And wherever I mention a new term, I explain it in plain 
English. When the movie comes out (I’m thinking Kevin Spacey plays me, 
although Daniel Day Lewis would also be a good choice), these explanations 
will be in bold subtitles. I rarely get geeky on you, because AdWords is largely 
a user-friendly interface. Occasionally, I do show off by explaining a technical 
phrase — feel free to skip those sections unless you’re preparing for a big game 
of Trivial Pursuit — Cyber Edition.
Conventions Used in This Book
I know that doing something the same way over and over again can be boring 
(the opening credits of The Brady Bunch comes to mind), but sometimes 
consistency can be a good thing. For one thing, it makes stuff easier to 
understand. In this book, those consistent elements are conventions. In fact, 
I use italics to identify and define the new terms. I also put search terms and 
keywords in italics. 
Whenever you have to type something, I put the stuff you need to type in 
bold type so it’s easy to see.

3
 Introduction
When I type URLs (Web addresses) within a paragraph, for the rare snippets 
of code I show you, and for keywords, I use a monospace font that looks like 
this: www.dummies.com.
What You Don’t Have to Read
This is the hardest part of the book for me because each word I wrote is my 
baby, and they’re all wonderful. Nevertheless, I am contractually obligated to 
let you off the hook at least a little, so here goes.
 
You can skip all the paragraphs marked with the Technical Stuff icon. I just put 
that in because I like the icon, and to give you confidence that I know what I’m 
talking about. The sidebars aren’t crucial to the plot either, although many of 
them feature tips and examples from very sharp AdWords users.
If you already have an AdWords account, you can actually skip Chapter 2, 
which shows you how to set up an AdWords account. 
Foolish Assumptions
As I gaze into my polycarbonate ball (crystal balls are breakable, and I can be 
clumsy), I see you as clearly as if you were sitting here with me in this hotel 
lobby in Wisconsin at 5:30 in the morning. You have a barely noticeable scar 
just above your right elbow where you cut yourself against a pool wall when 
you were eleven, and you are wearing a plaid watchband.
The foolish assumptions that informed my writing include the guess that 
the main market for your ads reads and speaks English. If not, no big deal: 
Just substitute Spanish or Russian or Azerbaijani for English as you read 
(although the reference to Azerbaijani muffins may confuse you).
I’m also assuming that your AdWords goal is business-related, especially in 
the way I talk about the desired outcomes of your campaigns — that is, leads, 
sales, profits, and so on. If you’re advertising on behalf of a nonprofit, you 
can easily substitute your own desired outcomes, including signatures on 
an online petition, additions to your mailing list, or attendance at an event. 
Your outcomes can be nonmeasurable as well, such as convincing Web site 
visitors to reduce their energy consumption, support a political candidate or 
position, eat healthier food, and so on.

4
Google AdWords For Dummies, 2nd Edition
I make several foolish assumptions about your level of computer savvy. I 
assume you can make your way around a Web site, including clicking, typing 
in Web addresses, completing forms, and so on. I assume you have access to 
a working credit card (no, you can’t borrow mine) so you can sign up and pay 
for AdWords.
I don’t assume that you’re using a PC or a Mac. You can benefit from this 
book whatever computer platform you use: Mac, PC, Linux, Hairball (all right, 
I made that last one up). Some third-party software works on Windows PCs 
only, but you can accomplish 99 percent of the tasks in this book using just a 
Web browser and text editor.
I also assume you can get Web pages created. You don’t have to create them 
yourself, but either through your efforts or someone else’s, you can design, 
upload, name, and edit simple HTML Web pages.
How This Book Is Organized
I sent my editor an unabridged dictionary and told him all the words from the 
book are in it, and he could decide which ones go where (that’s his job, after 
all). It turns out I was wrong: Google wasn’t even in the dictionary (the one I 
got for my college graduation in 1987), so it was back to the drawing board.
On my next try, I divided this book into parts, which I organized by topic. 
Google AdWords is the big topic, but much of the book focuses on what you 
have to do before and after AdWords in order to be successful. You don’t 
have to read it in order. In fact, every time I wrote, “As you saw in Chapter 4,” 
my editor sent a slight electric shock through the Internet into my keyboard. 
So start anywhere you like, and go anywhere you like. If you’re looking for 
information on a specific AdWords topic, check the headings in the Table of 
Contents or skim the Index.
By design, this book enables you to get as much (or as little) information as 
you need at any particular moment. Having gotten through college English by 
reading the jacket blurbs of great novels (this was before Google appeared 
in the dictionary), I understand the value of strategic skimming. By design, 
Google AdWords For Dummies is a reference that you reach for again and again 
whenever you encounter a new situation or need a fresh poke of inspiration.

5
 Introduction
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser
Before you drive your AdWords vehicle to success, let’s get you pointed in 
the right direction. Forget everything you learned about marketing in business 
school, and understand that AdWords is fundamentally a direct marketing 
medium. You discover what that means, and how it differs from the brand 
advertising that we see all around us, and how to play the direct marketing 
game to win.
Once you’re oriented and pointed toward success, I show you how to start 
your engine and drive around the block safely before going to the races.
Part II: Launching Your 
AdWords Campaign
Before you activate your first campaign, I introduce you to the single most 
important element of AdWords (actually, of just about all online marketing): 
choosing the right keywords. I show you how to do this through various 
online research tools and methods, most of which are quick, free, and easy.
Next, you master the ads themselves. Because AdWords is the most competitive 
advertising space in existence (slapping your ad in the middle of 20 others 
offering more or less the same thing), you must deploy advanced strategies 
for creating compelling, action-triggering ads. Otherwise no Web traffic, no 
leads, no money. I focus on text ads because they are the most common and 
(in their simplicity) provide the best opportunity to illustrate direct marketing 
principles. I also cover image ads, video ads, and local business ads connected 
to Google Maps.
Part III: Managing Your 
AdWords Campaigns
The two bricks of your AdWords campaign are keywords and ads. If you hired 
me to build you a house and I just dropped a dump truck full of bricks on 
your empty lot, you wouldn’t be happy. The chapters in this part give you the 
blueprints to turn your bricks into a sound and effective structure, and the 
tools to build and maintain it. You learn how to structure campaigns and ad 
groups, manage keyword bids, and target the right traffic.

Google AdWords For Dummies, 2nd Edition
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink
This is my favorite part of the whole book, the part where my family dragged 
me away from my keyboard as I kicked and screamed, “Wait, I haven’t told 
them about Crazy Egg yet.” After you set up your campaigns and paid for 
visitors to your Web site, you learn how to use lead-generating magnets to 
collect contact information from visitors — and to use e-mail to stay in touch 
and build a relationship. I also cover Web site strategies to extract maximum 
value from each visitor.
Part V: Testing Your Strategies 
and Tracking Your Results
Actually, this is my favorite part of the whole book (okay, my other favorite) 
because I show you how to fail your way to success inexpensively, quickly, 
and predictably. When you test multiple approaches, one is almost always 
better than the other. As long as you keep testing properly and paying 
attention to the results, you can’t help but achieve constant incremental 
(and sometimes enormous) improvement in your profitability.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part of my hazing in the For Dummies fraternity included creating top-ten lists 
that, alas, will never make their way onto Letterman. They include beginners’ 
mistakes you want your competitors to make instead of you, and case studies 
that bring the principles of the book to life. The Part of Tens is a resource you 
can use whenever you’re stuck, except for wedding toasts and term papers 
about the causes of World War I.
 
Be sure to check out www.dummies.com/go/adwords to see this book’s 
two bonus chapters as PDF files. These two bonus chapters provide you with 
top-ten lists of the best AdWords tools available and tips for writing great ads.
Icons Used in This Book
Unfortunately, I could not convince my editor to let me use an icon of a sumo 
wrestler wearing a tutu hurtling toward you on ice skates to indicate, “This 
paragraph makes absolutely no sense, but you should pay close attention to 
it anyway.” So I stuck with the standard For Dummies icons:

7
 Introduction
 
I hope my tips don’t hurt as much as the one in the icon, but are just as sharp. 
I use this bull’s-eye to flag concepts that can cut months from your AdWords 
learning curve.
 
I use this icon to remind you to remove the string that’s cutting off the 
circulation to your index finger. (What were you thinking?) Also, this icon 
highlights points and items that should be on your AdWords To-Do list. Little 
tasks that can prevent big problems later.
 
I’ve heard too many stories of AdWords beginners turning on their campaigns, 
going to bed, and waking up to $16,000 craters in their credit cards. I use the 
bomb icon when a little mistake can have big and nasty consequences.
 
I’m probably less geeky than you are. I’ve learned enough code writing to be 
dangerous (ask my Webmaster, who probably has installed a one-click backup 
for my sites by now), but not enough to be useful. So I use this icon only to 
impress you with my knowledge of certain geeky terms and when I share a 
snippet of code that your Webmaster can deal with if you don’t want to.
 
I’ve created a companion Web site to this book at www.askhowie.com. Many 
of the processes you implement can be hard to describe on paper, but simple 
to show in a video tutorial. (If you’re not sure what I mean, try describing to 
someone how to tie his shoes.) I include video footage of my own computer 
screen so you can see and hear exactly how to do what I tell you to. Also, the 
Web addresses of articles, resources, and tools change from time to time. 
When I suspect that the current URL won’t be valid by the time you read this, I 
send you to my site, which will either automatically redirect you to the right 
location, or provide an even better resource that wasn’t available when I was 
writing the chapter.
Where to Go from Here
I’m thinking that a nice bowl of gazpacho would be nice right about now. 
Fresh Roma tomatoes, cilantro, onions, some cumin, and maybe a few chunks 
of cucumber, sweet corn, and avocado floating on top. Wanna join me?
You can start reading wherever you want, but I’d like to point out a couple of 
fundamental chapters that you will want to understand fully before spending 
money on AdWords. Chapter 1 gives you the direct marketing mindset you 

8
Google AdWords For Dummies, 2nd Edition
need to use AdWords effectively, and Chapter 4 guides you to a deep 
understanding of your market. Skim Chapters 10 and 11 before turning on 
the traffic to your Web site.
When you have the lay of the land, you may want to implement the tracking 
described in Chapter 14 as soon as you set up your account (explained in 
Chapter 2). Knowing the profitability of each element of your AdWords 
campaign makes everything easier and more fun.
 
The companion Web site www.askhowie.com is a good place to go for more 
information, detailed video tutorials, updates, and an e-mail newsletter on 
AdWords tips and strategies. If you encounter something online that is 
different from the book, check the www.askhowie.com/readers site for 
updates. You can also check out www.dummies.com/go/adwords2e for 
other updates.
If you’re aching to tell me how much you love this book and how you’d like 
to fly me, first-class, to Cape Town, Fiji, or Maui to teach a workshop, give a 
keynote, or just enjoy a well-deserved vacation, feel free to e-mail me at 
support@askhowie.com.

Google Advertiser

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces Google AdWords and shows 
you how to get started. Almost everyone is familiar 
with the Google search engine; however, few people 
understand how easy it is to pay to display your ad listing 
on the coveted first page of search results — and how 
challenging it can be to do so profitably.
Chapter 1 discusses online search as a revolution in 
advertising and reveals the marketing-mindset shifts 
required for success. You discover how to get into your 
customers’ minds and see through their eyes so your 
advertising will be customer-centric and effective.
Chapter 2 takes you through the mechanics of creating — 
and immediately pausing — a single campaign. (Patience, 
grasshopper.) Chapter 3 shows you step by step how to 
populate that account correctly with keywords, ads, 
placements, and bids. These chapters provide the 
foundation upon which your AdWords success is built — 
customized campaigns with settings that support the 
achievement of your goals.

Chapter 1

H
ave you ever bought an ad in the Yellow Pages? I remember my first 
time — I was terrified. I didn’t know what to write. I didn’t know how 
big an ad to buy. I wasn’t sure which phonebooks to advertise in. I had no 
idea what headings to list under. I had to pay thousands of dollars for an 
ad I wouldn’t be able to change for the next 12 months. And I had recurring 
nightmares that I mistyped the phone number and some baffled florist in 
Poughkeepsie got thousands of calls from my customers.
Why am I telling you this? (Aside from the fact that my therapist encourages 
me to release negative emotions?) Because I want you to appreciate the 
significance of Google AdWords as a revolution in advertising.
You can set up an AdWords account in about five minutes for five dollars. 
Your ads can be seen by thousands of people searching specifically for what 
you have, and you don’t pay a cent until a searcher clicks your ad to visit 
your Web site. You can change your ad copy any time you want. You can 
cancel unprofitable ads with the click of a mouse. You can run multiple ads 
simultaneously and figure out to the penny which ad makes you the most 
money.
You can even send customers to specific aisles and shelves of your store, 
depending on what they’re searching for. And you can get smarter and 
smarter over time, writing better ads, showing under more appropriate 
headings, choosing certain geographic markets and avoiding others. When 
your ads do well, you can even get Google to serve them as online newspaper 
and magazine ads, put them next to Google Maps locations, and broadcast 
them to cell phones — automatically.

12
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
AdWords gives you the ability to conduct hundreds of thousands of dollars of 
market research for less than the cost of a one-way ticket from Chapel Hill to 
Madison. And in less time than it takes me to do five one-arm pushups (okay, 
so that’s not saying much).
AdWords can help you test and improve your Web site and e-mail strategy 
to squeeze additional profits out of every step in your sales process. It can 
provide a steady stream of qualified leads for predictable costs. But AdWords 
can also be a huge sinkhole of cash for the advertiser who doesn’t understand 
it. I’ve written this book to arm you with the mindsets, strategies, and tactics 
to keep you from ever becoming an AdWords victim.
Introducing AdWords
The Google search engine, found at www.google.com, processes hundreds of 
millions of searches per day. Every one of those searches represents a human 
being trying to solve a problem or satisfy an itch through finding the right 
information on the World Wide Web. The AdWords program allows advertisers 
to purchase text and links on the Google results page (the page the searcher 
sees after entering a word or phrase and clicking the Google Search button).
You pay for the ad only when someone clicks it and visits your Web site. 
The amount you pay for each visitor can be as low as one penny, or as 
high as $80, depending on the quality of your ad, your Web site, and the 
competitiveness of the market defined by the word or phrase (known as a 
keyword, even though it may be several words long) typed by the visitor.
Each text ad on the results page consists of four lines and up to 130 characters 
(see Figure 1-1 for an example ad):
 
Figure 1-1:

✓ Line 1: Blue underlined hyperlinked headline of up to 25 characters
 
✓ Line 2: Description line 1 of up to 35 characters

13
 Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution
 
✓ Line 3: Description line 2 of up to 35 characters
 
✓ Line 4: Green display URL (URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, the 
way the Internet assigns addresses to Web sites) of up to 35 characters
The fourth line, the display URL, can differ from the Web page your visitor 
actually lands on. I cover this in detail in Chapter 6.
Where and When the Ads Show
You can choose to show your ads to the entire world, or limit their expo-
sure by country, region, state, and even city. You can (for example) let them 
run 24/7 or turn them off nights and weekends. You also get to choose from 
AdWords’ three tiers of exposure, described in the following sections.
Google results
When someone searches for a particular keyword, your ad displays on the 
Google results page if you’ve selected that keyword (or a close variation) as 
a trigger for your ad. For the ad shown in Figure 1-1, if someone enters kids 
asthma prevention in Google, they can view the ad somewhere on the top 
or right of the results page (see Figure 1-2).
 
Figure 1-2:

14
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
Search partners results
Your ads can also show on Google’s search partners’ network. Companies 
such as AOL and EarthLink incorporate Google’s results into their search 
pages, as in Figure 1-3.
A partial list of Google search partners includes
 
✓ American Online (AOL): www.aol.com
 
✓ Ask.com: www.ask.com
 
✓ CompuServe: http://webcenters.netscape.compuserve.com/menu
 
✓ EarthLink: www.earthlink.net
 
✓ Netscape Netcenter: www.netscape.com
 
✓ Shopping.com: www.shopping.com
AdSense sites and Gmail
Additionally, hundreds of thousands of Web sites show AdWords ads on their 
pages as part of the AdSense program, which pays Web site owners to show 
AdWords ads on their sites. (See Figure 1-4 for an example.) Think of an online 
version of a newspaper or magazine, with ads next to the editorial content. The 
content of the page determines which ads are shown. On sites devoted to 
weightlifting, for example, Google shows ads for workout programs and muscle-
building supplements, rather than knitting and quilting supplies. Google lets 
you choose whether to show your ads on this Content network, or just stick 
to the search networks.
Although anyone with a Web site can use the AdSense program, Google has a 
special relationship with some of the most popular content sites on the Web, 
including
 
✓ About: www.about.com
 
✓ business.com: www.business.com
 
✓ Food Network: www.foodnetwork.com
 
✓ HGTV: www.hgtv.com
 
✓ HowStuffWorks: www.howstuffworks.com
 
✓ InfoSpace: www.infospace.com
 
✓ Lycos: www.lycos.com
 
✓ The New York Times: www.nytimes.com
 
✓ Reed Business: www.reedbusiness.com

Gmail is Google’s Web mail service. It displays AdWords results to the right 
of the e-mail you receive. If you choose to syndicate your ads, your prospects 
who use Gmail may see them if the text of the e-mail is deemed relevant to 
your offer. For example, Figure 1-5 shows an e-mail that I (almost) sent to the 
MacArthur Foundation, humbly explaining why I should receive one of their 
“genius grants.” To the right, you can see ads for small business grants, a 
Cow Ringtone, triggered by my mention of a self-esteem program for cows, 
and two resources for college grant-seekers.

AdWords in the Total Google Context
Google rose from nothing to become the world’s most popular search engine 
in just a few months because it did one thing faster and better than all the 
rest: help Internet searchers find what they were looking for. I don’t want 
to overload you with the details of Google’s search algorithm (especially 
because it’s such a secret that if I told you, I’d have to kill you, and I would 
have to understand words like eigenvector and stochastic in order to explain 
it), but you will become a better Google advertiser when you get the basic 
principles. The most important word in Google’s universe is relevance.
 
When you type a word or phrase into Google, the search engine asks the World 
Wide Web for the best page to show you. The big innovations Google uses are a 
couple of calculations: One, called PageRank, is basically a measure of the 
popularity of a particular page, based on how many other Web pages link to that 
page and how popular those pages are. (Sort of like high school — the definition 

17
 Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution
of a popular kid is one who is friends with other popular kids.) The other 
calculation is known as Page Reputation, which answers the question, “Okay, this 
page may be popular, but for which topic?” The Page Reputation of a Web page 
determines whether it will appear in a given search; the PageRank determines 
whether it will be the first listing, the third, or the four million and eleventh.
The entire Google empire is based on this ability to match the right Web 
pages, in the right priority order, with a given search phrase. The day Google 
starts showing irrelevant results is the day after you should have sold all your 
Google stock.
When Google started, it only showed the results of its own calculations. 
These results are known as organic listings. Organic listings appear on the left 
side of the Google results page (see Figure 1-6, which includes organic listings 
only and no AdWords entries).
In the early days of AdWords, your ad was shown based on a combination of 
two numbers: your bid price, or how much you were willing to pay for a click 
(that is, someone clicking your ad and visiting your Web page), and a very 
important metric called Click-Through Rate (CTR), which is the percentage 
of searchers who click your ad after seeing it. Now, Google also takes into 
account the quality of the fit between the ad and your Web site. If searchers 
exit your site so fast that they leave skid marks, Google figures that they 
didn’t find what they were looking for, and you’re penalized for irrelevance.

Pay Per Click: Your Online 
Gumball Machine
AdWords is a PPC (pay per click) advertising medium. Unlike other forms of 
advertising, with PPC you pay only for results: live visitors to your Web site.
A really short history lesson
The first pay per click (PPC) search engine, 
goto.com (whose name changed to Overture 
and now is known as Yahoo! Search Marketing), 
ran on a straight auction basis. Whoever 
wanted to show an ad in the top position simply 
bid more per click than everyone else for a 
given keyword. Google rose to preeminence in 
the PPC world because it figured out that letting 
badly written, unappealing ads rise to the top 
just because an advertiser was willing to spend 
a lot of cash was bad for everyone. Bad for the 
search engine, because the search engine 
doesn’t get paid unless a Web visitor likes the 
ad enough to click it. Bad for the advertiser, 
because unappealing ads usually come 
from the same lazy or confused thinking that 
produces unappealing and unprofitable Web 
sites. And most important, bad for the search 
engine user, who was now getting unappealing 
and irrelevant listings muddying the results 
page, and would therefore start searching for 
a better search engine.
AdWords elegantly solved this problem by 
rewarding advertisers whose ads were popular 
with searchers. If your ad was twice as 
popular as a competitor’s (meaning it was 
clicked twice as often), your cost per click 
(the amount of money you paid Google when a 
searcher clicked your ad and visited your Web 
site) was half what your competitor was paying 
for the same position on the page.
For example, suppose you and your competitor 
both bid $1.00 on the keyword elephant 
ride, and 1,000 people see each ad. Forty 
people click your ad, and 20 people click your 
competitor’s. Your ad would appear above 
your competitor’s for a cost per click of around 
$0.51 — if it’s twice as popular, it costs half as 
much.
Highly relevant and compelling ads rose to the 
top of the page, while unappealing ads faded 
away as they proved unprofitable. Google also 
began AdWords with a cutoff on CTR: If your ad 
couldn’t compel at least 5 out of the first 1,000 
viewers to click it, Google would disable it and 
make you rewrite it before it could be shown 
again. They also instituted a three-strikes-and-
you’re-out rule — after the third disablement, 
you had to pay $5.00 to resuscitate your ad.
Over the years, Google has been tweaking the 
AdWords program to provide more and more 
relevant search results to its users. This book 
contains the very latest updates as I write, 
but please realize that Google never stops 
moving. While it’s impossible to predict the 
exact changes Google will implement, you can 
be sure that it’s always moving in the direction 
of greater relevance for its users. If your ads 
and Web pages always provide real value to 
real people, and don’t exist just to “game” the 
AdWords machine, you’re probably going to 
be just fine no matter what Google dreams up 
next.

19
 Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution
AdWords allows you as the advertiser to decide how much you’re willing to pay 
for a visitor searching on a given keyword. For example, if you sell vintage sports 
trading cards, you can bid more for Babe Ruth rookie card than John 
Gochnaur card if you can make more money selling the Babe Ruth card.
For many businesses, advertising is like a slot machine: You put in your money, 
pull the handle, and see what happens. Sometimes you do well; sometimes you 
don’t. Either way, you don’t learn much that will help you predict the results of 
your next pull. PPC has changed all that for businesses with the patience and 
discipline to track online metrics. Just as a gumball machine reliably gives you 
a gumball every time you drop a quarter, PPC can reliably deliver a customer 
to your Web site for a predictable amount of money. Once you run your num-
bers (explained in Part V), you know exactly how much, on average, a visitor is 
worth from a particular keyword. You may find that you make $70 in profit for 
every 100 visitors from AdWords who searched for biodegradable wedding 
dress. Therefore, you can spend up to $0.70 for each click from this keyword 
and still break even or better on the first sale.
The Direct Marketing Difference: Getting 
Your Prospects to Do Something
Direct marketing differs from “brand” marketing, the kind we’re used to on 
TV and radio and newspapers, in several important ways. AdWords represents 
direct marketing at its purest, so it’s important to forget everything you 
thought you knew about advertising before throwing money at Google.
Direct marketers set one goal for their ads: to compel a measurable response in 
their prospects. Unlike brand marketers, you won’t spend money to give people 
warm and fuzzy feelings when they think about your furniture coasters or ring-
tones or South Carolina resort rentals. Instead, you run your ad to get hot pros-
pects to your Web site. On the landing page (the first page your prospect sees 
after leaving Google), you direct your prospect to take some other measurable 
action — fill out a form, call a phone number, initiate a live chat, drop everything, 
race to the airport and hop on the first plane to Hilton Head, and so on.
On the Web, you can track each visitor from the AdWords click through each 
intermediate step straight through to the first sale and all subsequent sales. 
So at each step of the sales cycle, on each Web page, in each e-mail, with 
each ad, you ask your prospect to take a specific action right now.
Brand advertisers rarely have the luxury of asking for immediate action. The 
company that advertises home gyms during reruns of Gilligan’s Island has no 
illusion that 8,000 viewers are going to TiVO the rest of the episode and drive, 
tires squealing, to the nearest fitness store to purchase the GalactiMuscle 
5000. They count on repetition to eventually lead to sales.

20
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
Contrast that approach with infomercials, which have one goal: to get you to 
pick up the phone NOW because they realize that once you get distracted, 
they’ve lost their chance of selling to you.
The Internet outdoes the immediacy and convenience of the infomercial by 
maintaining the same channel of communication. Instead of jumping from 
TV to phone, AdWords and your Web site function together as a seamless 
information-gathering experience.
You can measure your results
Because your prospects are doing what you want them to do (or not), you 
can measure the effectiveness of each call to action. For example, say you sell 
juggling equipment to left-handed people. You show your ad to 30,000 people 
in one week. Your ad attracts 450 prospects to your Web site, at an average 
CPC of $0.40. Your landing page offers a 5% off coupon in exchange for a valid 
e-mail address, and by the end of the week, your mailing list has 90 leads — 
20% of all visitors. You follow up with an e-mail offer that compels 10 sales 
totaling $600.00.
The following table shows an example of an AdWords ad campaign’s overall 
metrics.

These numbers give you control over your advertising spending, allow you 
to predict cash flow (just play a game of Monopoly with my daughter if you 
don’t appreciate the value of positive cash flow!), and enable you to assess 

21
 Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution
additional market opportunities by comparing them to this pipeline. (If 
you’re not rubbing your hands together and going, “Muahahaha” like a 
cartoon villain, I still have some explaining to do.)
In this hypothetical case, you have found a gumball machine that gives you 
$1.33 every time you drop 40 cents into the machine. You’ve set it up once, 
and it happens automatically as long as Google likes your credit card. ROI 
is a metric that simply converts your input amount to a single dollar, so you 
can easily compare ROI for different campaigns and markets. ROI answers 
the question, if you put a dollar into this machine, how much comes out? 
ROI of 333% means that you get $3.33 out for every dollar you put in. If you 
found a gumball machine that managed that trick, you’d never go back to slot 
machines again.
Now suppose the market becomes more competitive, and your CPC rises. If 
you were advertising in your local newspaper and the ad rep told you that 
prices were going up by 25 percent, what would you do? Would you keep 
advertising at the same level, cut back, or stop showing your ads in that 
paper completely? Unless you’re measuring the ROI of your ads, you have no 
way to make a rational decision.
Say your AdWords CPC from the example shown in the preceding table 
increases by 25 percent. Now your cost per visitor is 50 cents. Do you keep 
advertising? Of course — you’re still paying less for a lead than the value of 
that lead — 83 cents less. Your ROI is down from 333% to a still respectable 
267% (total advertising cost is now 450 × $0.50 = $225, and $600 ÷ $225 = 267%).
But wait — there’s more! (Did I mention how much I enjoy a good infomercial?) 
AdWords makes it simple not only to see your metrics but also to improve 
your profitability by conducting tests. The ability to test different elements of 
your sales process is the next important element of direct marketing.
Keep improving your marketing
So far in this chapter, I’ve only discussed inputs (how much you pay to 
advertise and how many Web site visitors) and outputs (how much you 
receive in sales). But it’s really the intermediate metrics (called throughputs 
by people like me who sometimes find it useful to pretend we went to business 
school) that give us an opportunity to make huge improvements in our 
profitability.
For example, imagine you improve the CTR of your ad from 1.5% to 2.2% 
without lowering the quality of your leads. Big whoop, right? An improvement 
of 0.7% — who cares? Actually, it’s an improvement of 68% — for the same 
$180 advertising spend, you now get 660 visitors instead of 450. If everything 
else stays the same, your visitor value of $1.33 means your sales increase to 
$880, for an ROI of 489%.

22
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
But wait — there’s more! What’s to stop you from improving your landing 
page by 20 percent by testing different versions? Instead of getting 20 leads 
out of 100, you’re now collecting 24. Six hundred sixty visitors now translate 
into 158 leads. If 11 percent of them make a purchase from your e-mail offer, 
that’s 17 sales. At an average of $60 per sale, you’ve now made $1,020.
But wait — there’s more! How about testing your e-mail offer too? Let’s say 
you get a 36 percent improvement, and now 15 percent of e-mail recipients 
make a $60 purchase. That’s 23 sales at $60, for a new total of $1,380.
Thanks to the miracle of compounding, the three improvements (68% × 20% 
× 36%) give you a total improvement of 230%. This isn’t pie-in-the-sky math, 
either — when you test the elements of your sales process scientifically, 
it’s hard not to make significant improvements. See Chapter 13 for the 
stunningly simple explanation of how to do it. And Chapter 14 shows you 
how to consistently improve the ability of your Web site to turn visitors into 
paying customers.
It’s dating, not a shotgun wedding
In case you got a little lost in the numbers in the previous section, I want to 
make sure you got the moral of that direct marketing story: It’s a process of 
multiple steps. Seth Godin (marketing guru and author) compares direct 
marketing to dating. You wouldn’t walk up to a stranger in a museum and 
propose marriage. (If you did, and you’re happily married 17 years later, 
please don’t take offense; I’m not talking about you.) In fact, there are a lot of 
things you wouldn’t suggest to a stranger in a museum that you might very 
well suggest to someone who knew you a little better. (If you’re not sure what 
these are, check out Dr. Ruth’s contribution to the For Dummies series.)
Direct marketing operates on the premise that you have to earn your prospects’ 
trust before they become your customers. As with dating, you demonstrate 
your trustworthiness and likeability by asking for small commitments with 
low-downside risk. Your ad, the first step in the AdWords dating game, makes 
a promise of some sort while posing no risk. Your visitor can click away from 
your Web site with no hassle or hard feelings. AdWords’ Editorial Guidelines 
commit you to playing nice on your landing page: an accurate display URL, 
no pop-ups, and a working Back button so your visitors can hightail it back to 
their search results if they don’t like your site.
Your landing page makes a second offer that involves getting permission from 
your prospects to communicate with them. Here’s the deal you’re offering: “I’ll 
give you something of value if you let me contact you. And any time you want 
me to stop contacting you, just let me know and I’ll stop. And I’ll never share 
your contact information with anybody else who might try to contact you.”

23
 Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution
Sometimes you can go right for the sale on the landing page, and sometimes 
it’s better to focus on turning your visitor into a lead — someone with whom 
you can follow up later. Chapter 10 offers guidelines for creating an effective 
landing page.
When your prospect gets to know you and trusts you, you increase the value 
you provide while asking for larger and larger commitments. Depending on 
your business, your sales/dating process could consist of surveys, reports, 
free samples, try-before-you-buy promotions, teleseminars, e-mails, live chat, 
software downloads, and more. When you ask for the sale, you in effect, are 
proposing marriage — or a long-term relationship, anyway.
Following up with your best prospects
Direct marketing focuses on prospects — people who raise their hands and 
tell you they’re interested in what you have. When folks click your AdWords 
ad, they’ve just identified themselves to you as someone worth developing a 
relationship with. Returning to the dating analogy, this is like a stranger 
smiling at you at the museum. You respond by striking up a conversation 
about the artwork you’re both looking at (“Do you think the green splotch 
in the upper-left-hand corner represents a rebirth of hope or an exploding 
drummer?”) If the two of you hit it off, you don’t want to leave the building 
without getting a phone number.
In dating, the phone number is the litmus test of interest. If you can’t get 
the phone number, or if you call it and discover you’ve really been given 
the number for the West Orange Morgue (now why are you assuming that 
actually happened to me?), you know that relationship has no future.
Your prospect has the online attention span of a guppy. When we go online, 
we typically multitask, we have multiple windows open, we’re checking 
e-mail, IMing, watching videos, listening to MP3s, and searching and browsing 
and surfing. Not to mention answering the phone, opening the mail, eating 
and drinking, and dealing with other people. How many times have you 
visited a Web page, been distracted, and never found it again? How many 
times have you bookmarked a Web page, intending to visit again, and haven’t 
gotten around to it?
Get the prospect’s e-mail address as soon as you can. Before they get 
distracted. Before they browse back to Google and click one of your 
competitors’ ads. Before they spill a cappuccino latte all over the keyboard.
With their e-mail address and permission to follow up, you’ve done all you 
can to inoculate yourself from the short Internet attention span. You now 
have a chance of continuing the conversation until it leads to a sale.

How to Think Like Your Prospect
I began this chapter with a pathetic rant about my experiences as a Yellow 
Pages advertiser. Now let’s look at the Yellow Pages from the point of view 
of the user — the person searching for a solution to a problem. But I’m done 
whining, so I’m not going to complain about figuring out which heading to 
look under, deciding which listing to call, dealing with voice mail (no, really, 
I’m done whining). Instead, imagine a totally new experience: the Magic 
Yellow Pages.
In the Magic Yellow Pages, you don’t have to flip through hundreds of pages. 
In fact, the book doesn’t have any pages — just a blank cover. You write down 
what you’re looking for on the cover, and then — Poof! — the listings appear. 
The most relevant listings, according to the Magic Yellow Pages, appear on 
the cover. Subsequent pages contain more listings, in order of decreasing 
relevance.
But wait — there’s more! The listings in the Magic Yellow Pages don’t have 
phone numbers. Instead, touch the listing and you’re magically transported 
to the business itself. Don’t like what you see? Snap your fingers and you’re 
back in front of the Magic Yellow Pages, ready to touch another listing or type 
another query.
This is how AdWords functions from the point of view of your prospects: They 
have all the power. They conjure entire shopping centers full of competing 
shops by typing words — and they window-shop until they find what they 
want or give up.
Their search term represents an itch that they want to scratch at that very 
moment — some unsolved problem. They are looking for the shortest distance 
between their itch and a good scratch. Maybe they want information. Maybe 
they want a product. Maybe they want to be entertained. Maybe they want to 
be told that their problem isn’t so bad.
It’s your job to figure out what they really want (based on the keyword they 
type) and give it to them quicker and more obviously than your competitors. 
In the Magic Yellow Pages, the rules are, “Give the prospect what she wants 
and nobody gets hurt.” Winning the game of AdWords comes down to figuring 
out what your prospect — the person you can help — is thinking and feeling 
as they type their search. When you understand this, you bid on the right 
keywords, you show compelling ads, and you present clear and irresistible 
offers on your Web site. See Chapter 4 to discover how to conduct quick and 
easy keyword research, so you can become the champion itch-scratcher in 
your market.

Chapter 2
Setting Up Your AdWords Account
In This Chapter
▶ Starting with AdWords
▶ Navigating the setup process
▶ Creating your first campaign
▶ Activating and managing your account
You’re about to set up a fully functioning AdWords account! I congratu-
late you on this momentous step in your online advertising career. I’m 
so glad I’m here to share it with you.
In this chapter, I walk you through setting up your account. If you already 
have an existing account, you can skip ahead to the next chapter “Managing 
Your AdWords Account,” where you explore three basic account features: 
campaign management, keyword selection, and ad writing.
Opening a New AdWords Account
Fortunately, Google has greatly simplified the process for opening a new 
AdWords account:
 
1. Open your Web browser and go to http://adwords.google.com.
 
2. (Optional) Choose a language other than English (US) from the drop-
down list at the top right, and Google will translate the page into that 
language.
 
3. Click the Start Now button at the top right.
 
 (Sometimes the button is labeled Click to Begin or Let’s Get Started. I’ve 
never seen it read Drink Me, but I’m hopeful . . . .)

4. Select Standard Edition and click the Continue button.
 
 This step may no longer be part of the process because the Starter 
Edition is headed toward retirement. So if you don’t see this option, 
relax, remember that AdWords continues to evolve, and skip to Step 5. 
If you wish to learn more about the Starter Edition or already have a 
Starter Edition account, you may want to check out the Starter Edition 
bonus chapter, which is available online at www.askhowie.com/
starter.
 
5. Select the type of e-mail you want to use with your AdWords account. 
If you chose an existing Google Account, enter your Google Account 
information, and then click the Continue button. Otherwise, type your 
e-mail address, new password (twice), and the Visual Verification text, 
and then click the Create Account button.
 
 An AdWords account can be created with any e-mail address combined 
with an AdWords–specific password. If you already have a Google 
Account for Gmail or other Google services, you can use it for your 
AdWords account. If you are a Gmail junkie, for example, you’ll want to 
connect the accounts so you don’t sign yourself out of AdWords every 
time you check your mail. If you don’t have a Google Account, you’re 
prompted to create one using an existing e-mail account. Watch out for 
the Visual Verification text that Google uses. It took me only three tries 
to get it right.
 
6. Select your currency from the drop-down list and click the Continue 
button.
 
 Your AdWords account is now created. If you used an existing Google 
Account, your account is now active. You will receive an activation 
e-mail with a link to the AdWords start page. Click that link and skip to 
Step 9. If you did not use an existing Google Account, then a verification 
e-mail is sent to the e-mail address you used in Step 5.
 
7. Check your e-mail and click the verification link in the Google 
AdWords Account Verification e-mail.
 
 Your AdWords account is now activated.
 
8. Click the Click Here to Continue link.
 
 This takes you to the AdWords start page in Step 1.
 
9. Log in to your new AdWords account (upper-right side) by typing the 
e-mail and password you used in Step 5 and clicking Sign In.
 
 Are you in? Congratulations! You are now ready to create your first 
campaign.

27
 Chapter 2: Setting Up Your AdWords Account
Creating Your First Campaign
Google has made creating your first campaign as easy as possible. Here’s all 
you have to do:
 
1. Click the Create your first campaign button.
 
2. (Optional) Select one or more languages from the list box.
 
 If you’re advertising exclusively in English, do nothing. To choose mul-
tiple languages, hold down the Ctrl key while you click (for PC users) or 
the Ô key (for Mac users).
 
3. (Optional) Click the Change Targeting link to change the country or 
countries where you want your ads to be seen:
 
a. A pop-up window with lots of options appears, but to keep it 
simple for now, try to ignore the map and click the Browse tab. 
In the upper box (left side), click the appropriate check box to 
select each country in which you want your ads to be shown. The 
selected locations appear in the lower box. You can target your ads 
with flashlight-like (not really laser-like) precision. I show you how 
to do this in Chapter 7.
 
b. To remove a country, just click its check box to unselect it.
 
c. When you’re done, click the Done button to close the pop-up 
window.
 
4. Click the Continue button.
 
5. Fill in the text boxes to create an ad; click the Continue button when 
you’re finished.
 
 Now Google wants you to create your first ad. What, you’re not ready 
to whip out a masterpiece of persuasive prose at the drop of a cursor? 
No worries. Type pretty much anything here — you won’t show it to the 
world for a while. The following list provides guidance on what to enter 
in those text boxes:
 
• In the Headline text box, type the problem or opportunity.
 
• In the Description Line 1 text box, enter a short description of big 
benefit.
 
• In the Description Line 2 text box, write a short description of your 
product/service.
 
• In the Display URL text box, type your Web site’s name.
 
• In the Destination URL text box, enter the URL of the exact Web 
page you want customers to visit first (called the landing page).

28
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
 
 The display URL is what your prospect sees in the ad itself. It must 
be “real” enough to go somewhere relevant if they were to type it, 
but it doesn’t have to be the same as the actual destination URL. 
Think of the display URL as the name of your online store; would 
you rather buy a CN Netcom amplifying phone headset from www.
StuffThatSitsOnYourDesk.com or www.PhoneSupplies.com/
Netcom-Headsets? You can use the destination URL to track your Web 
site’s traffic and to show different pages to different markets.
 
 See Figure 2-1 for an example. But please don’t sweat it at this point. 
Just write something that doesn’t violate Google’s editorial or content 
guidelines (see the section, “When nobody can see your ad,” later in this 
chapter) and move on.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Write your 
first ad.
 
 
6. Type your chosen keywords into the text box and click the Continue 
button when you’re finished.
 
 For now, choose a single keyword that someone searching for your busi-
ness might type. For example:
used cars
glow in the dark poker chips
functional fitness training
 
 You should also use two variations of this keyword that represent 
phrase and exact matches. For a phrase match, enclose the keyword 
in quotes; for an exact match, enclose the keyword in brackets. These 
variations are described in detail in Chapter 5. If your keyword is gout 
recipes, then the two variations would be “gout recipes” and 
[gout recipes].

29
 Chapter 2: Setting Up Your AdWords Account
 
 Type your keyword along with its two variations into the keyword text 
box, one keyword per line. (See Figure 2-2.)
 
 Just above the Continue button, Google asks whether you want to look 
for more keywords. For now, ignore the invitation. In Chapters 4 and 5, 
you discover how to find keyword variations to your heart’s delight.

keywords.
 
 
 Google is, at its core, a very large data processor. By tracking the behav-
ior of searchers, it gets smarter all the time — and can offer better sug-
gestions to advertisers and better search results to shoppers. Google 
notices, for example, how long a person stays away after clicking an ad or 
free listing. Say you click my ad, look at my Web page for 3 seconds, and 
then click back to Google for another search; that tells Google you didn’t 
think much of my site. Enough data like that, and my bid prices will 
increase to penalize me for not giving Google’s users what they want.
 
 The keyword-suggestion tool can be helpful, but don’t use it right now. 
Until you understand how to create tightly focused ad groups, the tool 
will create a messy and unfocused campaign. Use the tool later to refine 
your campaigns. Right now, just pick one or two closely related terms, if 
you like, and continue.

7. Type how much you’re willing to spend in the Enter Your Daily 
Budget and the Enter Your Maximum CPC text boxes.
 
 Ready to have some fun? It’s trial-and-error time, thanks to Google’s 
Traffic Estimator. Enter any numbers you like for daily budget and maxi-
mum CPC and then click the View Traffic Estimator link. It shows you 
estimated CPC, the position of your ad, the likely number of clicks per 
day, and your daily cost. An ad position of 1 puts you at the top of the 
first page, 9–10 put you at or near the bottom of the first search-results 
page or top of the second page, and 11+ puts your ad squarely on page 
2, or worse.
 
 Typically, an ad on page 2 gets one-tenth the impressions of the same ad 
on page 1, so (unless the clicks are ridiculously expensive on the first 
page), page 1 is where you want to be.
 
 To view the maximum traffic you could possibly expect from that key-
word, enter a maximum CPC of $100 and a daily budget of $10,000.
 
 Make sure you change these back before continuing!
 
 Google shows you the most you’ll pay for a click if your ad is in the top 
position and the maximum number of clicks each keyword will generate 
in a day. Keep in mind, your ad may outperform or underperform this 
estimate, depending on how well it connects with your prospects.
 
 Settle on a CPC you can live with financially that puts your ad some-
where on the first page. You can make adjustments when you have 
actual results to base them on.
 
8. Click the Continue button.
 
9. Review your selections on the next page, decide whether you want 
e-mail from Google about AdWords strategies and tips, choose an 
appropriate answer from the How Did You First Hear about Google 
AdWords drop-down list, and finally, click the I’ll Set Up Billing Later 
button.
Managing Your Account
The two right-most tabs at the top enable you to manage the business side of 
your AdWords Account: Billing and My Account. The Billing tab allows you to 
keep track of your spending and update credit cards. Click the tab and you 
see two items in a drop-down list: Billing Summary and Billing Preferences. 

31
 Chapter 2: Setting Up Your AdWords Account
Billing Preferences is where you go to set up your payment options. Don’t 
forget to use the AdWords Gift Card code included with this book when you 
are providing your other billing details.
The My Account tab (see Figure 2-3) allows you to update your login infor-
mation, set your e-mail notification preferences, and enable access to your 
account by other users. It also has two subtabs: Account Preferences and 
Account Access. Explore them at your leisure — they’re pretty self-explanatory.

tab.
 
If you run an online pharmacy, you’ll need a PharmacyCheckerID before 
Google will let you advertise. Go to the Account Preferences subtab, find 
the PharmacyCheckerID section, and click the Edit link. On the page that 
appears, click the Read Our FAQ link to find out how to apply.
Activating your account
Your ads won’t show up on-screen until you activate your account by giving 
Google five bucks and a working credit card number (you get $25 in prepaid 
clicks when you use the gift card in the back of this book). You can do this 
by clicking the link in the warning box with the reddish-pink background 
and following the account activation wizard, or take the tour first and pay 
later. Even if you activate now, you can pause your campaigns so you aren’t 
charged for a lot of traffic before you know what you’re doing. After you 
complete your account setup, wait 15 minutes, and then browse to www.
google.com and do a search on your keyword. (See Figure 2-4.)

Figure 2-4: 
Activating 
your 
account.
 
To activate your account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Billing tab and then click Billing Preferences.
 
2. Use the drop-down list to select your billing country.
 
 The most common choices are at the top, followed by a long list of just 
about every country there is.
 
3. Select your country from the Time Zone Country or Territory drop-
down list, and then select your time zone from the Time Zone drop-
down list.
 
 Google won’t let you change your time zone after you set it, so be careful 
here. No second chances!
 
4. Click the Continue button.
 
5. Choose a payment method.
 
 You can choose between Postpay Billing (to be charged when clicks 
come in) and Prepay Billing (having the cost of clicks deducted from 
a prepaid balance). For Postpay, you can choose between Direct Debit 
from a bank account and a charge to a credit card, such as American 
Express, JCB, MasterCard, or Visa. For Prepay, your only option is a 
credit card.
 
 Dave Jabas of www.myemailassistant.com recommends using a 
dedicated low-limit credit card just for your AdWords billing. Although 
Google includes circuit breakers like budgets and maximum click costs, 
sometimes things go wrong. If you limit your exposure to a few hundred 
or a few thousand dollars, you won’t wake up one morning with a giant 
Google bill and no earthly idea how it happened.

 You’re taken to a screen where you fill out billing information. If you’ve

 Don’t forget to click the Click Here link next to “Do you have a promo-
tional code” if you own this book and aren’t reading it in the bookstore 
café with a latte on your lap. Then enter the promotional code, printed 
on the big green coupon in the front of the book, in the text box. The 
promotional code provides you with $25.00 worth of AdWords clicks, 
and covers your $5.00 activation fee.
 
 After you complete the form, your account is live — and your ad should 
start showing on the right side of the Google search results page for the 
keywords you selected.
After you complete your account setup, wait 15 minutes, and then browse to 
www.google.com and do a search on your keyword.
Look at the top and the right of the search results page. If you don’t see your 
ad, scroll down and click the More Sponsored Links link. Keep going through 
the pages until you see your ad or you get to the end of the listings. This 
exercise gives you an idea of the competitiveness of your market. If you see a 
lot of competitors, don’t get discouraged. It means a lot of people think they 
can make money here. The information in this book will put you way ahead 
of most of them. Seeing no or few competitors for a keyword may indicate a 
market that’s too small or too unresponsive.
When nobody can see your ad
If your ad doesn’t appear in the right column within 30 minutes of account 
activation, you may have a problem. Usually, correcting it is simple — once 
you figure out what it is.

34
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
If your ad isn’t receiving any impressions (indicated by a 0 in the last row of 
the Impressions column), you may be a victim of one of the following:
 
✓ Editorial disapproval: Have you violated Google’s editorial guidelines? 
If you throw exclamation points around like crazy, promise “the best” 
or “the cheapest” stuff, capitalize like you’re screaming in a chat room, 
use copyrighted terms, offer cheap drugs from Canada or $25 Rolexes 
or nuclear-weapon-making instructions, or commit any of a dozen other 
infractions, your ad won’t show.
 
 Google lays out their rules here:
 
• Editorial Guidelines: https://adwords.google.com/select/
guidelines.html
 
• Content Guidelines: https://adwords.google.com/select/
contentpolicy.html
 
✓ Low ad rank: Based on your monthly budget (which you set when you 
create the account) and your choice of a maximum bid price (which 
you can edit at any time), your ad may be relegated to page 19 of search 
results. That is the equivalent of scribbling it onto the back of a gas sta-
tion receipt in yellow crayon and tossing it into a dumpster.
 
 You can see exactly in what positions your ads show. At this point, you 
can try raising your minimum bid — and monthly budget — to see if that 
gets you onto the first page of search results.
 
✓ Poor keyword performance: If your keyword is pink slippers big 
enough to fit an African elephant or some other phrase that 
few or no people would ever search for, you could wait a long time before 
seeing a single click. In Chapter 5, I introduce you to the spy tools that 
help you find exactly what people are typing into their online searches.
 
✓ Poor keyword Quality Score: Google assigns each keyword in your 
account a Quality Score, based partly on the match between the keyword, 
the ad, and the landing page of the Web site, and partly on the historical 
performance of that keyword in other AdWords accounts. If Google thinks 
that a keyword you’ve chosen isn’t going to make them money (because 
it won’t generate AdWords clicks) or will give searchers a poor quality 
experience if they select your ad, your ad will appear far away from the 
first page of search results. Google forces you to improve the quality 
score (see Chapter 5) or place a really high bid to show your ad.
When just you can’t see your ad
Sometimes your ad is receiving impressions, but try as you might, you can’t 
find it yourself. Before you start humming the Twilight Zone theme, consider 
the possibilities described in the following subsections.

35
 Chapter 2: Setting Up Your AdWords Account
Google thinks you’re searching outside your geo-targeting
When you first set up your account, you had to choose a geographic location 
within which to advertise. Google may be interpreting the information it’s 
reading on your computer (specifically, its Internet Protocol [IP] address), to 
mean you yourself are outside of your targeted area. IP addresses are loosely 
connected to different parts of the world.
To find out where the Internet thinks you are, go to www.ipligence.com 
and scroll down until you can see the map at the bottom right, shown in 
Figure 2-5.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Here 
ipligence.
com shows 
me where 
the Internet 
thinks my 
computer 
resides.
 
There are many reasons why Google could get confused about where in the 
world you are. First, IP addresses aren’t exact — they’re not like zip codes or 
postal codes. Second, if you’re connecting to the Internet through a service 
that’s somewhere other than where you are, Google can be misled. Third, 
little green aliens from outer space sometimes take over my fingers when I’m 
typing stuff I really don’t know anything about so that the paragraphs look 
long enough to be authoritative.

36
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
 
Every machine connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, a string of 
four numbers separated by dots. Google’s IP address, for example, is 
216.239.51.100. The IP address is the “real” Internet address. We humans give 
Web sites names, like Google and WalletEmptyingJunk.com, so we can find 
them more easily. The Internet machines map these names onto the numbers 
to send our browsers and e-mails to the right places.
Confused? Try this experiment: Open a Web browser, type 216.239.51.100 
into the address bar, and press Enter. If you enter the numbers and dots cor-
rectly, you should arrive at Google’s home page.
Your IP address may be unique to your computer, shared by other computers 
on your network, or even shared by many of the computers served by your 
Internet service provider (ISP).
You chose a different language
If you choose to advertise in Spanish (for example), you may not be able 
to find your ad if your Google searching preference is set for English. To 
change it (you can always change it back), go to www.google.com and click 
Preferences next to the search box. Click the Search Only for Pages Written 
in These Language(s) radio button and put a check next to the relevant 
language. Click Save Preferences to return to your search.

Chapter 3
Managing Your AdWords Account
In This Chapter
▶ Running AdWords
▶ Managing your campaigns
▶ Writing your ads
▶ Selecting your keywords
A
fter you set up your AdWords account, it’s time to explore Mission 
Control. In this chapter, I focus on the three basic AdWords tasks: cam-
paign management, keyword selection, and ad writing.
Running Mission Control with the 
Campaign Management Tab
The first screen you see when you go to http://google.com/adwords and 
enter your user name and password is the Account Snapshot screen (shown 
in Figure 3-1). The snapshot screen shows the summary statistics of all the 
campaigns in the account: total cost, total number of clicks, total impres-
sions, and overall CTR. If you prefer to go straight to the Campaign Summary 
page when you log in, scroll to the bottom of the Account Snapshot page and 
click the Make Campaign Summary My Starting Page link.
You spend the majority of your AdWords time in the Campaigns tab. After 
this chapter, most of the book shows you how to improve your online adver-
tising by using various features within this tab. For right now, I show you the 
cockpit without asking you to go for a test flight.

38
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
 
Figure 3-1: 
The 
Account 
Snapshot 
page gives 
you an 
overview of 
your entire 
account.
 
You can view your account from three levels that range from overview to 
granular. The All Online Campaigns view lists your campaigns and gives you 
basic metrics on each one. The individual campaign view provides the same 
level of detail about the different ad groups in a particular campaign. The ad 
group view shows you the finest details about every ad and every keyword in 
that ad group. This last view is where you spend most of your time. Use the 
other two views to help you prioritize which ad group will give you the big-
gest return for time spent.
All Online Campaigns view
The All Online Campaigns view gives you another set of tabs: Campaign, Ad 
Groups, Settings, Ads, Keywords, and Networks. This page lists your cam-
paigns and gives summary data about each of them. The column headings 
(Campaign, Budget, Status, and so on) are clickable, so you can sort your 
campaigns in various ways. For example, you probably want the campaigns 
that cost the most to be in your face more; click the Cost heading to sort 
from most to least costly. Click Cost again to reverse the order.

39
 Chapter 3: Managing Your AdWords Account
 
By default, Google shows all your campaigns as folders on the left of your 
screen, with a Help section just below. When you click a folder or campaign 
name, you enter that campaign, and can access individual ad groups as sub-
folders. I often hide this section of the page by clicking the double chevron 
button at the top right of the section, especially when I want to see all the data 
for a campaign or ad group without having to scroll left to right. You can 
always get the folder view and Help section back by mousing over the left 
margin, or by clicking the double chevron button (now pointing the other 
direction).
Campaign
By default, AdWords assigns your campaign exciting and informative names 
like Campaign #1 and Campaign #2. For your own sanity, please replace 
these generic names with descriptions that will make sense when you’re run-
ning dozens of campaigns at once. You can change the name of a campaign 
by placing your cursor over the name and then clicking the Edit icon (looks 
like a pencil) to the right of your cursor. Replace Campaign #1 with a more 
useful name and click the Save button.
Budget 
Google shows you the daily budget you set for each campaign. It’s grayed 
and bracketed in paused and deleted campaigns. You can change your daily 
budget for any campaign by clicking the budget amount ($20/day, for exam-
ple), changing it in the text within the yellow pop-up, and then clicking Save.
Current Status
Campaigns can be active, paused, or deleted. You change the status of a 
campaign by clicking the little icon to the left of the campaign name. You can 
choose a green dot for active, two vertical lines for paused, or a red x for 
deleted. 
 
✓ Active: Active campaigns display your ads to searchers. They cost you 
money and bring visitors to your Web site.
 
✓ Paused: Paused campaigns are on hold, but can be reactivated by plac-
ing a check next to the campaign and clicking the Resume button above 
the list of campaign names. Pausing a campaign automatically pauses all 
the ad groups in that campaign. No impressions, no clicks, no visitors.
 
✓ Deleted: Deleted campaigns can also be reactivated by a single click. So 
what’s the difference between pausing and deleting a campaign? Beats 
me. If you delete a campaign, you can’t actually make it go away. You can 
hide it by clicking the All but Deleted link (just above the Cost column). 

40
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
This can be helpful if you don’t want to clutter your screen with old 
campaigns, but still want to see active and paused campaigns. Also, it’s 
helpful to delete campaigns if you’re writing AdWords For Dummies and 
you don’t want the world to see every detail of your AdWords account 
in your screen shots. (See Figure 3-2.)
 
Figure 3-2: 
You can

or deleted 
campaigns 
to simplify 
your screen.
 
Clicks
A click represents one person clicking your ad and arriving on your landing 
page. Google doesn’t count multiple clicks from the same computer on the 
same day (or tries very hard not to) — that’s so your competitors can’t sit 
behind their desks and develop carpal tunnel syndrome trying to bankrupt 
you by clicking your ad repeatedly. Two clicks equal two unique visitors to 
your site.
Clicks are good, right? The more clicks, the more visitors to your Web site. 
Well, not so fast. Clicks cost you money, remember? You make back that 
investment only when the visitor buys something from you. The goal of your 
ad is twofold:

41
 Chapter 3: Managing Your AdWords Account
 
✓ To get all the people who will eventually buy from you to click your ad
 
✓ To discourage all the people who will never buy from you from clicking 
your ad
Obviously, you can’t know beforehand who will buy and who won’t. However, 
you can make some pretty good guesses until you implement conversion 
tracking (see Chapter 14).
For example, if you’re advertising a ponytail holder worn by Paris Hilton 
and you mention Paris Hilton in your ad and select Paris Hilton as a key-
word, chances are you’ll find a lot of visitors who have no interest in your 
hair accessory but a lot of interest in, shall we say, a multimedia Paris Hilton 
experience.
When you gain AdWords experience, you’ll learn how to turn the prospect 
tap wider or narrower to maximize profits.
Impr.
Impr. is short for impressions. Technically, an impression is a single instance 
of a search results page that contains your ad. It doesn’t mean the searcher 
saw the ad; he saw a search results page with your ad on it. If the searcher 
has a small screen with high resolution and your ad appears below the scroll 
(meaning he’d have to scroll down to view it), it’s still counted as an impres-
sion. So, if he clicks the first listing, before he look at yours, it still counts.
Impressions can indicate the potential size of your AdWords market. If you’re 
bidding on popular keywords, you can expect lots of impressions. But if your 
bidding strategy places your ad very low in the ad rankings, and it shows up 
on page four, you’ll see very few impressions — even though the market itself 
may be huge — because few searchers will actually go to page four of the 
search results.
CTR
CTR (Click-Through Rate) is the ratio of clicks to impressions, expressed as a 
percentage. It’s one of your most important AdWords numbers, so if you’re 
confused, take a little time to get clear on the concept. You can calculate CTR 
by dividing clicks by impressions. For example, if 200 people see your ad, and 
12 of them click it, here’s the math:
12 ÷ 200 = .06 = 6.00%
You’d then brag at the AdWords Saloon, “My CTR is 6 percent.” And everyone 
would understand that your ad was so compelling, 6 out of every 100 people 
who saw it ended up on your Web site.

42
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 
Avg. CPC
The Avg. CPC (cost per click) column tells you how much, on average, you 
pay Google to get a visitor to your Web site. You may have different average 
CPCs by campaign, ad-group, keyword, and ad. A big part of AdWords man-
agement is deleting or improving elements of your advertising that cost you 
more than you make back, so your average click cost is an important metric.
Cost
Your cost is simply all the money you spend on clicks. On this screen, cost 
is broken down by campaign. When you drill deeper, you can see how much 
each ad and each individual keyword costs you. (After you set up conversion 
tracking, described in Chapter 14, you can also track how much each ad 
makes you.)
Note: Some of the screen shots in this chapter include six columns you 
won’t see until you set up conversion tracking: Conv. rate, Cost/conv., and 
Conversions, each with two variations, One Per Click and Many Per Click. 
(See Chapter 14 for more on conversion tracking. Oh, the fun that awaits you!)
 
You can change the date range in the All Campaigns (or any other) view. Select 
one of the presets in the drop-down list at the top right of your screen, just 
below the green band that includes the top navigation, or select the first item 
in that list, Custom Date Range, input any two dates, and click the Go button. 
For some reason, Google insists that your start date be before your end date 
(that’s a little un-quantum-physics, don’t you think?). Get into the habit of first 
checking your date range when you work on campaign management. Otherwise, 
you panic when you see only six clicks and the cause isn’t a broken campaign, 
but a view set to Today instead of This Month.
Individual campaign view
Click your campaign name to see an overview of the ad groups within that 
campaign. You see all your ad groups’ statistics, including several new col-
umns: Max. CPC (up to three different types), Avg. Pos, and Avg. CPM.
 
✓ Search Max. CPC: This is the maximum cost per click (CPC) you select 
for clicks generated on the Google search results page when you create 
the account. You can change this bid for specific campaigns, the ad 
groups, or even individual keywords. In Chapter 7, you discover smart 
strategies for bidding different amounts on different keywords.
 
✓ Content Managed Max. CPC: This is the maximum you will pay for a 
click from content sites that you specify. You see this column only after 
you create managed placements; that is, you choose sites on the content 
network where you want your ads to appear. 

43
 Chapter 3: Managing Your AdWords Account
 
✓ Content Auto Max. CPC: This is the most you’re willing to pay for a click 
from the content network when Google chooses the pages based on 
your keywords. 
 
✓ Avg. Pos: The average position of your ad refers to where it appears in 
relation to all other ads showing for the same keyword. At the ad group 
level, an average position of 5.7 means that on average, your ad shows 
most often in position 6, less often in position 5, and occasionally higher 
or lower. If your average position is greater than 8, your ads are not 
showing nearly as much as they might — only very determined search-
ers ever go to the second page of Google results.
 
✓ Avg. CPM: If your ads are showing on the content network, you will see 
this column, which tells you how much on average you are paying for 
1,000 impressions.
 
Even though Google uses a pay-per-click model, it’s useful to think of buying 
ad space on a pay-per-impression basis. Google is trying to maximize its own 
profit per impression (that’s why Google rewards high CTR with lower bid 
prices), so you should also aim to make as much money as possible per 
impression. Plus, after you’ve had considerable experience in the content net-
work, you may want to change your bidding method from CPC to CPM. But 
don’t even think of CPM bidding until you really know what you’re doing in the 
content network. Otherwise, you may wake up to a painfully large bill and no 
visitors to your site.
You can see some trends, even with extremely small numbers. For example, 
my Gout diet ad group (in Figure 3-3) has received 27,052 clicks out of 
2,876,166 impressions, for a decent 0.94% CTR. This CTR translates into 94 
visitors to my Web site for every thousand people who view the ad in the 
Gout diet ad group. Each click costs me $0.11 on average, so I can expect to 
pay $10.34 for those 94 visitors.
 
Just because Google gives you lots of data to look at, you don’t have to rush 
out and buy a 30-inch monitor just so you can see it all without scrolling. You 
can hide columns: Click the Filter and Views button to the upper-right of the 
ad groups table, select Customize Columns from the drop-down list, and then 
remove the checks next to the columns you don’t need to see. You can also 
reorder columns by dragging and dropping them. When you finish, click the 
Save button to return to a more manageable dashboard.
 
Don’t make any assumptions or decisions based on numbers as low as I 
describe here. Generally, you want to see at least 30 total clicks before ascrib-
ing validity to the data. I know of one business owner who drove his business 
into the ground making knee-jerk changes based on tiny numbers. See Chapter 
13 for more than you ever want to know about statistical significance.
When you have more than one ad group in a campaign, the column headers 
become clickable and sortable.

44

Individual ad group view
In the Individual Campaign view, click the name of an ad group to drill down to 
the most detailed and powerful view, the individual ad group (see Figure 3-3).
 
Figure 3-3: 
Clicking an

Keywords tab
The Keywords tab is the first thing you see when you enter an individual ad 
group. It shows you several things at a glance:
 
✓ Look above the ad at the top left to see how many ads are competing in 
this group. At first, you see 1 of 1. I’ll want to create another ad — you 
almost always want to run multiple ads simultaneously to find the most 
effective one (I show you how to do this in Chapter 13). For now, you’ll 
see 1 of 1.

45
 Chapter 3: Managing Your AdWords Account
 
✓ Check the date range at the top right, just below the green header bar. 
You can change it by clicking the down arrow to the right of the current 
date range.
 
✓ Check how each of your keywords is doing. In addition to the columns 
you see at the campaign and ad group levels, you now see the Quality 
Score of each keyword. After you set up conversion tracking, you may 
also see several columns of conversion statistics (conversion is a fancy 
marketing word for “the visitor did something good at my Web site”). In 
Chapter 5, you discover the power of this screen — and learn to drive it 
like a pro.
Networks
To the right of the Keywords tab is the Networks tab. Click it to view and 
manage content network campaigns to determine where to show your ads 
(see Chapter 7).
Ads 
To the left of the Keywords tab is the Ads tab. Click it to view your ad. You 
see how that ad is doing and the networks it’s showing on. (To give you a 
taste of what’s in store, Figure 3-4 shows an ad group with two ads running 
simultaneously.)
Click the ad headline to go to your landing page. Mouse over the ad to see the 
Edit icon to the right (looks like a pencil). Click the pencil to change the ad. 
Delete it by marking the check box to its left and clicking the Change Status 
button (just above the ad) and then selecting Delete from the drop-down list.
 
By default, Google displays only your root URL — that is, only up to the .com 
or .org or .whatever — in the fourth line of the ad. Use your display URL to 
attract visitors to your Web site. For example, if you sell red staplers and are 
advertising on the keyword red stapler, the second URL below would be 
more attractive to prospects:
www.StaplerHeaven.com
www.StaplerHeaven.com/Red-Staplers
Change the URL by clicking the Edit link next to the fourth text box (the one 
with your Web site name in green) near the bottom of the page. Your display 
URL (the one that shows in your ad) doesn’t have to be identical to your 
landing URL (the page your visitors go after clicking). See Figure 3-5 for an 
example.

I will repeat it until you’re sick of hearing it; the key to success in Internet 
marketing is ongoing split-testing. Split-testing is creating two variations (in 
this case, of your ad), sending half your traffic to each, and seeing which one 
generates a better response. Not only that, the key to success in Internet 

47
 Chapter 3: Managing Your AdWords Account
marketing is ongoing split-testing. (I told you I’d repeat it.) AdWords gives 
you the ability to create a second ad to run alongside the first by following 
these steps:
 
1. On the Ad Group page, click the New Ad button (to the left of the 
Change Status button) and select Text Ad from the drop-down list.
 
2. Create a new ad and then click the Save Ad button in the lower left of 
your new ad.
 
 You immediately notice a second ad in your ad group. Now you can 
monitor the difference between your two ads by counting clicks. One of 
the ads will probably receive more clicks than the other ad. When your 
ads have accrued enough clicks to make a statistician happy, you can 
replace the “losing” ad with another challenger. For the full sermon on 
split-testing, please turn in your hymnal to Chapter 13.
Content network
Below your keyword list are three rows: Total – Search, Total – Content, and 
Total – All Ad Groups. These rows break down your results by source of 
traffic — Search refers to visitors who enter a keyword in the Google search 
engine; Content includes visitors who click your ad after seeing it on some 
Web page.
You can let the content network run for a bit just for curiosity’s sake, but a 
best practice is to turn it off for now. Here’s why: You may get a lot more con-
tent searches than keyword searches, which can overwhelm your monitoring. 
Keyword searches, because they’re tied to specific words, give you much 
better market data than impressions and clicks from a bunch of Web sites 
that are unknown to you.
Turn off the content network by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Settings tab and then click the Change Campaign Settings 
link.
 
2. In the Networks, Devices, and Extensions section, click the Edit link to 
the right of the list of networks and devices.
 
3. Click the radio button next to Let Me Choose and then remove the 
check from the box next to Content Network.
 
4. Ignore Google’s drop-down warning, click OK, and then click the Save 
button.
When your campaigns based on keywords are humming, see Chapter 7 to 
find out how to set up content network campaigns that won’t muddy your 
reporting.

AdWords Campaign

In this part . . .
T
his part is dedicated to finding and counting your 
prospects, so you can determine whether you have a 
business that can benefit from AdWords (or any other 
online-traffic-generation program), and then connecting 
with your prospects on an emotional level so they see 
your ads and Web site and immediately get the urge to 
reach for their wallets. The biggest business mistake is 
ignoring your market and trying to sell what you have, 
regardless of whether anybody needs or wants it.
Chapter 4 introduces you to the underground world of 
online market research. You see how to assess the 
profitability of a market in an afternoon, so your online 
adventures can be close to risk-free.
You explore the heart and soul of online marketing in 
Chapter 5: keywords. Keywords are the words and 
phrases that people type into search engines, YouTube, 
and eBay when they’re looking for something to read, 
watch, or buy. When you understand the keywords your 
prospects use to find you, and the hidden desires 
represented by those keywords, you’ll be successful.
Chapter 6 builds on the keyword foundation and shows 
you how to write ads that inflame the desires represented 
by keywords. It covers fundamentals and clever variations 
to make your ads more compelling and profitable.

▶ Taking the temperature of your market
▶ Polishing your profitability crystal ball
▶ Understanding buying trends at online stores
▶ Checking out your competition
T
he Internet is the ultimate spy tool — (ahem) I mean, market-research 
opportunity. If you know where to look (and you will by the end of this 
chapter), you can determine pretty precisely how many people are looking 
for your product, how much they’re willing to pay for it, and how much 
money your competitors are making from those people. You can also see 
how your competitors are marketing — their ads, Web sites, e-mails, promo-
tions, pricing, customer service — and learn a lot about what works and what 
doesn’t. On the Internet, we’re all marketing naked. In this chapter, you’ll 
discover how to become a peeping tom of prospects and competitors. Enjoy 
the view!
Assessing Market Profitability (Don’t 
Dive into an Empty Pool)
In the movie Field of Dreams, the Ray Kinsella character builds a baseball 
diamond in his Iowa cornfield based on a voice that mysteriously repeats, 
“If you build it, he will come.” That philosophy made for a great movie, but I 
don’t recommend it as a customer-acquisition strategy. If you build it, you’ll 
probably end up with a garage full of it — unless you take the time to figure 
out whether anybody’s going to want it enough to pay for it.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Ken McCarthy, creator of The System Seminar for Online Marketing (www.
thesystemseminar.com), once asked during a lecture, “If you were an 
Olympic diver, what would be the most important skill you could possess?” 
The answers varied — the ability to hold a triple gainer, strong core align-
ment, powerful legs, and so on — but Ken kept shaking his head no to each 
try. Finally, when we were getting really frustrated, he shared his answer: 
“The ability to tell if there’s enough water in the pool before diving.”
In other words, find out whether there’s a market before you commit large 
amounts of time and money to creating a business or a product (or to learn-
ing fancy marketing tricks to attract buyers). As Perry Marshall points out, 
amateur marketers create a product and then look for people to sell it to — 
whereas professional marketers find customers and then look for something 
to sell them.
Whether you’re starting a new venture online or you have an existing busi-
ness that you’re looking to expand online through AdWords, don’t spend any 
time writing ads, creating Web sites, sourcing products, setting up factories, 
hiring employees, or printing letterhead until you’ve looked into the pool and 
determined that you can dive without hitting the concrete floor at 60 miles 
per hour.
In the old days of business, that sort of market research was a drag. Labor-
intensive, expensive, imprecise, and slow. But if you want to sell online 
through paid search, you can save yourself months of agony and thousands 
of dollars in less time than it takes to fly from Bath, New York to Bath, 
England.
Glenn Livingston, a former consultant to Fortune 100 companies, has been 
doing online market research on a do-it-yourself budget with impressive 
results: He’s entered 12 online markets and achieved profitability quickly 
in all 12. That’s quite a batting average, considering that 78.6 percent of all 
new businesses fail within six months. (See Conveniently Making Up Statistics 
For Dummies for a full explanation of this calculation.) Considering that 
Glenn offers seven hours of free audio training on his state-of-the-art market-
research techniques at www.ultimateadwordsresearch.com (which you 
should take advantage of), I’m glad he could boil down those techniques to 
five critical factors for inclusion in this book:
 
“Traditional marketing wisdom says you make your money when you 
choose your market. Any fisherman will tell you that the best rod and bait in 
the world won’t do you any good in a mud puddle, so let’s talk about how to 
find the best fishing holes.
“While there are literally dozens of factors to consider when choosing a 
market, here are four of the absolute most important things to know before 
you go fishing . . .

53
 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
“How big is your market? (Market Size)
“How much is the average visitor worth? (Average Spend)
“What’s the total dollar volume? (Market Size x Average Spend)
“How stable is the market? (Market Stability & Trends)”
“Are you willing to do what it takes to get into THIS market?”
“Look at your competitors. How much personal contact are they offering? 
Do they only offer an e-book with electronic download and no live-chat or 
800#, or are they offering done-for-you services with personalized account 
reps and a massage for every customer? As a market gets more competitive, 
it moves from the former to the latter, and you have to be willing to jump in 
at an equal or better level of service than your competitors, or you’ll drown. 
Similarly, if everyone else in the market is providing a high end, $1,000 
product with a 50 percent margin, it’s going to be nearly impossible for you 
to get in with a $97 information product. Even if you’re the world’s most 
efficient and creative AdWords advertiser, they’ll be able to outspend, and 
therefore out-market you.”
Glenn boils down initial market research into one key question: “Are other 
people making money there?” Because the Internet is so decentralized, 
nobody knows exactly how big and juicy a given market is. And, as the diet 
ads say, individual results may vary. Glenn created some guidelines that 
allowed him to evaluate a market on a lazy Sunday afternoon, and have a 
very good idea of the potential profitability of the market by dinnertime.
 
Remember when your high school Social Studies teacher got mad at you for 
skipping all the comments on your essay and just flipping to the letter grade 
on the last page? You’re about to discover why — in the case of PPC (pay-per-
click) marketing, the letter grade — the potential profitability of the market — 
can get you into a lot of trouble if you don’t understand the data behind it. For 
example, certain markets can be profitable for advanced marketers and not 
beginners. Some markets can produce good results with a dozen keywords, 
while others require tens of thousands. No tool can ever replace your own 
judgment.
Determining market size 
by spying on searches
Want to know how many times people searched for keywords related to your 
business last month? How about which keywords were the most popular? 
And suppose you could do it in about 20 seconds — are you willing to spend 
the time before setting up your AdWords campaigns?

54
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
The number of searches is a critical number if you plan to make AdWords a 
significant part of your business acquisition strategy. Think Yellow Pages — 
if no one is looking for the listing Unicycles, a unicycle shop that relies on 
the Yellow Pages is going to have trouble paying the rent. Of course, many 
items and services are sold that aren’t searched for — just not with AdWords. 
For example, lots of people buy CDs with guided meditations. But very few 
people searched for them (about four per day), so you could reasonably 
expect one sale every one to two months from AdWords traffic if your ad and 
Web site were very good. And with that tiny trickle of traffic, your testing of 
alternate ads (see Chapter 13) and landing pages (Chapter 15) will provide 
conclusive results some time around the next ice age.
Use Google’s Keyword Tool (here’s a shortcut: www.askhowie.com/kwtool) 
to discover the popularity of the search terms in your market. When you navi-
gate to the Keyword Tool shortcut, here’s all you have to do:
 
1. Tell Google what language and geographic location you’re curious 
about by clicking Edit link next to the default options.
 
2. Make sure the Descriptive Words or Phrases radio button is selected.
 
3. Type your main keyword into the search box.
 
4. Deselect the Use Synonyms option.
 
 You’ll want to include synonyms as you build your keyword empire, but 
right now, focus on the main keyword family.
 
5. Type the squiggly characters into the box below to prove you’re a 
human.
 
6. Click the Get Keyword Ideas button.
Google gives you a list of the top keywords that include the words you typed, 
as shown in Figure 4-1. In the last column, Match Type, choose Exact from 
the drop-down list. You see the number of times each keyword phrase is 
searched on Google, during the previous full month and on average. Click 
the Approx Avg Search Volume header to sort by average monthly search 
volume, from greatest to least.
Scroll down to the end of the list (but before Additional Keywords to 
Consider) and download all the keywords by clicking the text, the .csv (for 
Excel), or .csv link. (If you have Excel on your computer, choose the Excel 
option.) A download window appears, allowing you to open the file directly or 
save it to your hard drive. When you open the spreadsheet, you see a column 
of keywords and three additional columns: Advertiser Competition, Approx 
Search Volume: December (or whatever the last month was), and Approx Avg 
Search Volume. The last column is the one you’re most interested in right 

55
 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
now. For later searches, you’ll include data on average cost per click and 
estimated ad position by selecting those columns from the Choose Columns 
drop-down list above the keyword list.
Quickly scan the keywords and delete any rows unrelated to your market. For 
example, if you sell books and supplies to rabbit owners, remove irrelevant 
terms, such as Velveteen Rabbit and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, from the list. 
Examine the remaining keywords, paying attention to several things:
 
✓ Which keywords are more popular (higher on the list) than others?
 
✓ Are there just a few keywords that result in the vast majority of 
searches?
 
✓ Do some of the keywords represent sub-markets within the main market 
(for example, rabbits for hobbyists versus rabbits for commercial 
purposes — pets or meat)?

Figure 4-1 shows that people searched for back pain 74,000 times the previ-
ous month. The top related terms include lower back pain (49,500), low 
back pain (14,800), and back pain relief (9,900). This information is 
helpful — not just now, while you’re assessing the potential risks and rewards 
of entering the market, but later on, when you choose keywords and write 
sales copy. For example, more than three times as many people searched for 

56
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
lower back pain than low back pain. If you’re writing the headline of a 
Google ad promising relief from back pain, that information would lead you 
to choose lower back pain as the term that mirrors the language of your 
market. You’d also use that information to create the copy on your Web site, 
and in offline marketing materials such as brochures, print ads, business 
cards, and so on.
The total number of searches for these keywords, which you can calculate 
in Excel by selecting the cell below the final entry in the Approx Avg Search 
Column and hitting the Autosum button (∑) in the Standard toolbar, is a good 
indication of whether it’s a good market to enter.
 
You can calculate how much traffic you need to be profitable with the Search 
Volume Profitability Calculator at www.askhowie.com/profcalc.
Estimating profitability by snooping 
on your competitors’ keyword bids
Most smart businesses will spend money on customer acquisition until they 
reach the break-even point. If you know that every time a Google user visits 
your Web page, you make 35 cents (on average, not for every single visitor) 
and you have the ability to sell additional products and services to that cus-
tomer in the future, you’d probably be willing to pay 35 cents to get the Google 
user to visit. That is, you’re willing to break even on the first sale to gain a 
valuable business asset: a customer with whom you can build a relationship. 
(Chapter 14 celebrates the break-even concept to your heart’s content.)
 
If you’re selling a product that promises customers will save or make money 
by using it, you can usually charge more for it than if the product doesn’t 
promise financial reward. It’s hard to translate money into happiness. It’s easy 
to compare the price of the product (say, a $750 AdWords telephone consulta-
tion with me) with the thousands of dollars you’ll save on your AdWords cam-
paigns. That’s why marketing consultants make more than life coaches. Keep 
this distinction in mind as you explore your markets.
If the average bid is under a dime, you can assume that very few people 
have figured out how to sell high-ticket or high-margin products or services. 
For example, about 75,000 people search for home remedies each month, 
yet the average bid hovers around 10 cents. Home remedy seekers are do-
it-yourselfers, looking for cheap and ingenious tips rather than expensive 
do-it-for-me solutions. Compare that to starting a business, which 
goes for over two dollars per click. This comparison points out an important 
distinction between markets: the buying-dollars-for-dimes market versus 
everything else.

57
 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
 
In some markets, bid prices bear little relation to the value of a visitor. Big 
companies (which I define as any organization where the person in charge of 
AdWords campaigns isn’t using a personal credit card to pay) tend to overbid. 
Some businesses are so good at earning money from visitors that they can 
afford to lose money to acquire a customer. But in general, the average bid 
price for a keyword gives you a good idea how much a click is worth, on aver-
age, to your competitors.
Google doesn’t share its bid prices publicly, but you can estimate them using 
either the Keyword Tool or the Traffic Estimator tool in your AdWords con-
trol panel. Both tools are erratic in their ability to predict your actual bid 
prices, but as long as you’re using them to compare markets in a very prelim-
inary “Is this worth my time?” sort of way, you needn’t worry about pinpoint 
accuracy.
Sizing up the entire market by tallying 
total advertising spent
By doing a little keyword research and entering your results into the MPG 
calculator that you can download from www.askhowie.com/mpg, you can 
assess the Total Market Health (TMH) — man, am I a fabulous acronym 
builder (FAB) or what? — of your market by combining the total number of 
bids with a weighted average of bid prices. This gives you a rough estimate of 
how much money is being spent in the market by PPC advertisers.
The process takes you fewer than ten minutes per market (I’ve done it so often 
I can do it in under five minutes), and it looks more complicated than it is. If 
you’ve never used a spreadsheet program before, you may want to have an 
Excel jockey friend on hand to help you the first time. Here’s all you need to do:
 
1. Go to www.askhowie.com/mpg and download the MPG Calculator. 
(I ask for your name and e-mail address in exchange — see Chapter 11 
to discover my strategy.)
 
 You’ll need Microsoft Excel or the free spreadsheet Calc available at 
www.openoffice.org to open the MPG.
 
2. After you’ve downloaded and opened the MPG, enter the keyword 
you searched using the free Keyword Tool.
 
 I describe this tool in the “Determining market size by spying on 
searches” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
3. Enter the total monthly search volume from the spreadsheet with the 
top 100 keywords into the MSV column of the MPG.

58
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
 
4. Log in to your account at http://google.com/adwords.
 
5. Click the Tools link and choose Traffic Estimator from the Optimize 
Your Ads section.
 
6. From the keyword spreadsheet, select and copy the entire column 
containing the keywords.
 
 Do not include the search volume numbers, just the keywords themselves.
 
7. Paste those keywords into the box at the top of the Traffic Estimator.
 
8. Leave Max CPC and Daily Budget blank, select the language and 
location targeting based on the market you’re going after, and click 
Continue.
 
9. Sort the results by Search Volume by clicking the Search Volume 
column header. Look at the Average CPC for the most searched 
keywords.
 
 This is Google’s estimate of the cost of showing your ad in positions 1–3.
 
10. Divide the Average CPC in half and enter that number in the 
Maximum CPC field. Click Get New Estimates.
 
11. Again, sort the keyword list by Search Volume. Keep reducing your 
Maximum CPC until the Estimated Ad Positions are 4–6 for the major-
ity of your highest volume keywords.
 
 (Keep sorting by Search Volume after each iteration.)
 
12. Now take the Average CPC estimated by Google and paste it into the 
CPC column of the MPG.
The MPG calculates the TMH for the market defined by that broad keyword. 
TMH is a number between 0 and 5,000 (some markets may top out above 
5,000, but that’s rare). Try this exercise with different markets, and espe-
cially with different variations of your main keywords. Which appears more 
profitable: car insurance or auto insurance? Back pain or back 
ache? Beekeeper or apiarist?
What sort of TMH are you looking for? The longer you do this, the better 
your feel will become, but for right now, you can follow Glenn’s rule of thumb: 
AdWords beginners should enter niche markets with TMHs between 100 and 
200. At 200, the markets become more competitive, and below 100, there’s 
not enough money to go around. One exception to this rule is the dollars-for-
dimes market. If you’re helping people make or save money, you can prob-
ably make a go of it with a TMH between 50 and 200.
 
Don’t get freaked out if Google’s Traffic Estimator tool initially predicts very 
high CPCs — those numbers are the bid prices for the top positions, which 
you probably don’t want, and reflect the “ignorance tax” Google imposes on 

59

advertisers who don’t follow the strategies you’re learning here. (See the 
“Bid persistence: Will you still love me tomorrow?” section, later in this 
chapter.) 
Giving your market a stress test 
to determine future health
If Oprah ever reads my hilarious yet touching and wise essay, “Manifesto of 
an Average Ultimate Frisbee Player,” surely she’ll invite me to be a guest on 
her show. For several weeks after this, many people will search online for 
Oprah Frisbee guy and a few variations. But would it be wise to build 
a business based on that keyword family? Probably not, because my fame 
(and it is coming, I tell you) is likely to be fleeting. If your business success 
depends on short-lived trends or fads, you’ll never turn your AdWords cam-
paigns into business assets. They won’t be reliable. Similarly, if your market 
is trending downward (Ken McCarthy discovered that very few people in the 
21st century are searching for buggy whips anymore, even though they had 
been all the rage 100 years earlier), you can’t rely on past data.
Luckily, Google publicly shares a tool that allows you to view trends in your 
market to help you decide whether it’s stable, growing, or declining.
Visit Google Trends (www.google.com/trends) and search for the major 
keywords in your market. Is the traffic stable over the past few years? 
Trending upward? Good. If it’s trending downward, beware. You’ll see sea-
sonal cycles in the Google Trends graphs, as shown in Figure 4-2. Don’t worry 
about dips that occur regularly each year. Be worried if the overall graph 
trends downward.
Aside from being fascinating and addictive (at least for people who subscribe 
to American Demographics magazine), Google Trends gives you a longer-
term picture of your market. Why, for example, did searches on back pain 
spike in July 2005? I don’t know, but I’ll bet some chiropractic market analyst 
has an answer. The Cities, Regions, and Languages tabs provide more useful 
information. For instance, the Regions tab reveals that 9 of the 10 countries 
ranked for most back pain searches were part of the British Empire at one 
point in their history. Coincidence? Maybe.
Sometimes, Google superimposes news headlines on the graph, as shown in 
Figure 4-3. William Shatner’s hospitalization for back pain in October 2005 
(point B on the graph) appears to have triggered little additional interest, 
but the December 2006 ABC news report on lower back pain and yoga (point 
C) either anticipated or sparked another explosion of interest going into the 
new year. I don’t know what any of this means, but if I were selling products 
to help your aching back, I’d spend a lot of time looking at graphs like these. 
And whatever your market, I recommend you do the same.

 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
Taking the Temperature of Your 
Market — Advanced Methods
The search data described in the preceding section represents the demand side 
of your market. The following sections look at the supply side — information 
about the businesses selling in that market, and how much they’re making.
To continue paying homage to Ken McCarthy’s swimming-pool metaphor, 
it’s not enough for the Olympic diver to be able to tell that the pool contains 
660,253.09 gallons of water. If the water is frozen solid, diving in isn’t a good 
idea. If the market consists of hundreds of thousands of monthly searches but 
no buyers, you’re diving in a frozen market — and it won’t feel good when you 
land on your head (or your empty wallet).
The average bid price, which I describe earlier in this chapter, is one indica-
tor of the responsiveness of a market. But this issue is so important that you 
should take some time and corroborate your first impression with several 
other data sources.
Number of advertisers on Google
In the popular imagination, entrepreneurs get rich by creating products and 
services that nobody else has ever thought of. In real life, that rarely happens. 
Truly original products and services often languish for years until they catch 
on. Rather than celebrating when you discover that no one else is selling 
what you want to sell, you should become somber and a little nervous. Then 
take a deep breath, relax your shoulders, and continue with your day. (I didn’t 
want to leave you all nervous and tense — you might get back pain, and I’m 
not selling anything in that market. Much better for me if you get gout.)
Go to www.google.com, search for your keyword, and count the number 
of sponsored listings. You can do this by clicking More Sponsored Links just 
below the column of AdWords ads on the right (see Figure 4-4). The first ten 
listings appear on that page. Click the Next button at the bottom to bring up 
listings 11–20. Keep clicking Next on each subsequent page until you run out 
of Next links to click. Figure 4-5 shows the end of the long line of ads for the 
keyword lower back pain. Seven ads on result page 9 translate to 87 ads.
 
For some reason, Google doesn’t always display the More Sponsored Links 
link the first time you search. Refresh the page until that link appears by 
choosing View➪Refresh or View➪Reload in your browser.
You’ll see slightly different results depending on your geographic location — 
a number of listings in my example were for local chiropractors — but the 
general trend will be clear.

62
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Glenn Livingston (www.ultimateadwordsresearch.com) cautions 
AdWords beginners to avoid competing on keywords with more than 25 com-
petitors. After you’ve cut your teeth in less competitive markets, you can 
begin to assault the lofty domains of high profit. After all, if someone’s doing 
well there, why not you?

 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
Bid persistence: Will you 
still love me tomorrow?
Beware of markets full of here-today-gone-tomorrow advertisers. After 
all, advertisers are trying new things all the time, thanks to Google’s no-
commitment, low-cost model. Just because you can gather more market 
data on a Sunday afternoon than Procter & Gamble could amass during the 
entire Carter administration doesn’t mean the data is stable. Bids especially 
are vulnerable to sudden change because each bid represents not an entire 
market segment but one merchant’s decision that day.
A simple way to establish bid persistence is to print the first two pages of the 
sponsored listings and then print the listings again at least three weeks later. 
To reduce your risk as much as possible, repeat this exercise again three 
weeks after that. If you see that the listings are stable over those six weeks, 
these folks are either very careless or they’re making money.
Going deeper with the AdWords 
Keyword Tool
Earlier in this chapter, I describe how to use the Keyword Tool and Traffic 
Estimator to assess Total Market Health. Now I show you how to use the 
Keyword Tool to figure out whether you can afford to use AdWords to test 
your initial sales process. Google is famous for being wildly inaccurate in pre-
dicting your actual bid prices because your actual bid depends on the quality 
of your Web site (as well as on the invisible hand of capitalism). The Keyword 
Tool, like the Traffic Estimator, gives you a dollar amount based on the his-
tory your competitors have amassed, which makes it more, not less, valuable 
at this point in your research.
To use the AdWords Keyword Tool within your account, follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your AdWords account, click the Tools tab, and then select 
Keyword tool from the drop-down list. 
 
2. Enter your main keyword and enter click the Get Keyword Ideas 
button.
 
3. In the Choose Columns to Display drop-down menu, select Show 
Estimated Avg. CPC and Show Estimated Ad Position.

64
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Figure 4-6 shows the estimated CPC for back pain and — hundreds of 
related keywords — as well as the position you can expect for that CPC. If 
your default CPC for that ad group is too low, enter a higher Max CPC in the 
box and click the Recalculate button. You can also enter smaller CPCs and 
recalculate to find out how little you can expect to pay for various positions. 
The lower the CPC, the less profitable it’s been in the past for other AdWords 
advertisers. You’re looking for a sweet spot, where the Max CPC is low enough 
that you can afford to pay for enough clicks to test and improve — and high 
enough that you can be sure others are making money in this market.

Discovering buying trends at online stores
Another source of Internet market data are the popular online stores. To dif-
ferent degrees, they reveal what their merchants are selling and/or what their 
patrons are buying.

 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
PayPal
Many online merchants conduct business using PayPal as their Web host and 
merchant account. PayPal graciously provides you with revealing glimpses 
of their bloomers by listing the sales numbers each shop has made (which is 
one reason not to use PayPal shops if you’re in a competitive market).
To score this data, go to www.askhowie.com/paypalshops, enter a key-
word and search for shops, or browse the category listings on the left, just 
below the search box (see Figure 4-7). In most cases, the category listings are 
too broad to help you assess the strength of a niche market. You can see 16 
pages of PayPal shops — at 25 listings per page, that’s a minimum of 376 mer-
chants selling products related to back pain.
 
Figure 4-7: 
PayPal 
shows you 
exactly how 
many sales 
its PayPal 
Shops 
merchants 
have made.
 
Spend some time looking at which merchants are making the most — and 
fewest — sales. Mattresses and magnetic wraps (passive devices) seem to 
be more popular than hypnosis products and advice (products that require 
active participation). Save yourself the grief of creating another failing online 
store by making sure that at least a few people are making sales of products 
similar to yours.

Amazon
Remember way back when Amazon.com was just a bookstore? Now it sells 
electronics, kitchen gadgets, outdoor furniture, clothes, shoes, musical 
instruments, groceries, jewelry, sporting goods, toys, and pretty much every-
thing else that can be put in a box and sent by UPS. Amazon has succeeded 
partly because it analyzes every bit of customer data it collects. If you’ve 
shopped at Amazon before and you have its cookie on your computer, it’ll 
show you a home page calculated to vacuum the maximum amount of money 
from your wallet, based on what it thinks you’ll want to buy next.
You want to search Amazon anonymously — so if you, too, get a personal 
greeting from Amazon (and you thought you were special, huh?) — so click 
the link at the top that says If you’re not Jack Bauer, click here. 
On the sign-up page that follows, don’t fill in anything. Instead, click the 
Amazon.com tab at the top left to re-enter the site as a stranger. Now, when 
you search, Amazon won’t filter the results based on your shopping history. 
Instead, it’ll serve you the most profitable products in each category.
 
A cookie is a tiny piece of code that a Web site stores in your computer so the 
Web site will recognize you in future visits. Amazon always greets me by name 
when I log on and shows me the items I looked at last, along with new recom-
mendations. If I delete all my cookies in my Web browser Options or 
Preferences menu, the next time I show up, Amazon will treat me like a new 
customer, about whom it knows nothing.
As in PayPal Shops, you can type in a search term or just browse by category. 
A category search of Exercise & Fitness (see Figure 4-8) shows the three most 
profitable products front and center: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill, and 
an elliptical trainer. On the right, it offers a low-cost item (a yoga mat) and a 
slightly higher-priced step system.
Drill down into categories and subcategories to see what Amazon knows it 
can sell in each market niche. You can also search by keyword; a search for 
back pain on the entire Amazon.com site (as shown in Figure 4-9) displays, 
on the left, 28,000 books, 1,436 products in Health & Personal Care, 211 items 
in Sports & Outdoors, 88 in Home & Garden, and so on. Click each category 
to find the bestselling items within it.
I want to see what’s hot in Health & Personal Care related to back pain. 
When I click that category, Amazon shows me the most popular items it or 
its partner stores carry (see Figure 4-10). In this case, it’s a Spine-Worx Back 
Realignment Device, a Body Back Buddy — which presumably can double as 
a coat rack — and lumbar support for the cheap desk chair your company 
buys because ergonomically sound chairs cost too much.

You might be tempted to throw in the towel if you see the product you want 
to sell, or a very similar one, listed on Amazon for 30 percent less than you 
can buy it for. Don’t worry — you have a huge competitive advantage over 
Amazon if you’ve chosen a specific market niche. Amazon will bid on 
AdWords, but your ads will be better. Your campaigns will be more efficient 
and more tightly targeted, and you will understand your customers’ fears and 
desires better than Amazon does.
 
The bottom line of all your research is to answer the question, “Are people 
making money online in this market using PPC?” If the answer is no, let go of 
this market for now and repeat the research process with a different market.
If the search volume is high enough and the customers are ready to spend 
money, you’re ready to go to a higher and more intensive level of research to 
find out what your prospects want — and what drives them crazy about their 
current situation.

 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
Eavesdropping at the Watering Hole
The size and temperature of your market tell you whether to enter that 
market. Knowing how many people are searching and buying doesn’t help 
you market to them yet. You just know they’re out there, poking around and 
buying stuff from your competitors. The next three research questions guide 
you to develop the right product and sell it using the right concepts.
Your future customers will tell you what they want to buy, how they want 
to buy it, what color and size and shape it should be, what kind of delivery 
options they prefer, and how much you should charge for it. They’ll talk for 
hours about what bugs them about other options and what the perfect solu-
tion to their problems would be. All you have to do is find out where the con-
versations are happening, sit down, and start listening.
Remember those nature specials on public television that show all the ani-
mals gathered around the watering hole in the savannah? They’re all hanging 
out, drinking, socializing, eating some grass, and sharing the day’s gossip. 
Your market has a watering hole where your buyers gather, too. If you want 
to find out what to sell to your market and how to sell it, you have to hang 
out at the watering hole.
Your market’s watering hole is where your prospects come to gather infor-
mation and develop relationships that will help them in their business. The 
offline component of a watering hole includes lunches, golf meetings, con-
ferences, phone calls, trade journals, water cooler gossip (a literal watering 
hole!), and the daily routines of business. The online component has two big 
parts: online groups and the Blogosphere (a cool word meaning the world of 
blogs).
Online groups
The two big providers of free groups are Yahoo! and Google. Spend some time 
on each site, searching for groups related to your keywords and your market. 
Join the most active groups, read the message archives, and follow the daily 
threads. Verify that the people in the groups are your prospects.
 
Resist the urge to do any selling in these groups. You’re at their watering hole, 
remember? If you start pitching your product or services, or contribute com-
ments that are off-base or self-serving or unhelpful, you’ve just identified your-
self not as a zebra, giraffe, springbok, or wildebeest, but as a crocodile! If you 
want to come back and sell to these groups later, after you’ve mastered their 
jargon and understood their concerns, they’ll freeze you out if you pushed too 
hard at the beginning.

70
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Yahoo! Groups
Begin at http://groups.yahoo.com. To join Yahoo! Groups, you need a 
free Yahoo! account. If you don’t yet have one, you’ll be prompted to create 
one. You can start searching for groups without an account, but you’ll 
need to create an account before you can join a group. If you have a Yahoo! 
account, log in and start searching. You can apply to join groups right away.
After you’ve done some searching, you’ll discover why Google, not Yahoo!, 
is the preferred search engine. Yahoo! focuses exclusively on keywords, and 
ignores meaning and context. When I typed Juggling into the Groups search 
box, the first two groups listed (as shown in Figure 4-11) were a support 
group for work-at-home moms and another for Christian homeschoolers with 
more than two children. They were in the top positions not for relevance, but 
because they were the two largest groups that had the word juggling in their 
description. Both groups, of course, used the term juggling metaphorically. So 
neither is a particularly useful watering hole to learn about your prospects’ 
views on replaceable wicks for juggling torches or the proper weight of a 
silicon stage ball. The next three groups, however, are closer to the mark: a 
group dedicated to Contact Juggling, a group of Christian clowns, and the 
main Yahoo! juggling group. The Contact Juggling group’s archives are public, 
whereas the other four groups require membership.
In addition to the keyword search, Yahoo! also gives you a directory of cat-
egories that may be more useful. At the top of Figure 4-11, you can see the 
categories Hobbies & Crafts > Hobbies > Juggling. Click Juggling to view 192 
different juggling-related groups. The first two groups look familiar. When you 
click Juggling2, you’re taken to the group’s home page, where you can read 
a description of the group, see how active the members are (by viewing the 
message-history chart), and decide whether it’s worth your time to join this 
group. To join, click Join This Group! on the right. On the next page, select 
the e-mail address you want linked to this group, choose how you want to 
receive messages (individual e-mail, daily digest, or Web only), select the 
e-mail format, copy some text to prove you’re a human and not a software 
program, and click Join. I recommend choosing the daily digest over indi-
vidual e-mails — if it’s an active group, you could easily spend your entire 
day dealing with off-topic threads about whether other threads are off-topic 
and nonsense like that. You can always change your preferences after you’ve 
joined, and you can also quit any group easily.
After you join, you can read through the archives and view profiles of group 
members. Figure 4-12 shows posts in the Juggling2 group.
If you wanted to launch a competing product to the Dube Airflight Clubs, you 
could gain valuable insight into what people like and don’t like about them. 
The posts shown in Figure 4-12 indicate that clubs striking in midair is a prob-
lem for some jugglers.

If you wanted to (say) sell against Airflight, you could create thinner clubs 
less likely to bang into each other, or softer clubs that wouldn’t hurt so much 
if they hit people in the head. And you’d save this post in an idea file for

Google Groups
To search Google Groups, go to http://groups.google.com. Google 
Groups hasn’t been around as long as Yahoo! Groups, so you won’t find 
Google communities as established as the Yahoo! ones. But Google Groups 
gets direct feeds from many of the independent Usenet groups that have 
existed since the late 1980s, and so provide much more comprehensive 
coverage of the market. When you search Google Groups for juggling, 
you don’t get the irrelevant listings that Yahoo! served up. The first groups 
Google shows you are a unicycling group, a non-Google group dubbed rec.jug-
gling (which I talk about in a minute), and a discussion list for the Vancouver 
Juggling Club (as shown in Figure 4-13).
To join a Google Group, click Apply for Group Membership on the right. If 
you’re logged in to your Google account, you’re taken to a sign-up page where 
you choose your e-mail delivery schedule, provide a nickname, and apply.
After you’ve been approved for membership, you can read and reply to mes-
sages, search the message archive by keyword, and post new questions. 
Google formats its group messages on the Gmail template — meaning that 
replies are kept next to the original message in chronological order.
Other free and paid subscription groups
The Yahoo! Juggling Group moderator sent a welcome e-mail informing me 
that the group doesn’t get much activity these days, and if I wanted to be in 
the thick of the juggling watering hole, I should try www.jugglingdb.com/
news, a portal to rec.juggling, a forum independent of Yahoo! or Google. In 
fact, I already saw a link to this group for the Google Groups search results.
The first page of messages on that forum is shown in Figure 4-14.
Even before joining this group, you can read all the posts, search for mem-
bers by country (useful for figuring out geographic ad targeting in AdWords), 
and look at the Juggling FAQs and lists of current vendors. If you’re starting 
or expanding an online business, this sort of homework is required if you 
prefer making money to gambling. And it’s so cheap, easy, and quick, I hereby 
grant you no excuses for not doing it.

The Blogosphere (“World of Blogs”)
Blogs are great places to learn about your customers because, for some 
reason, people write blogs like online diaries — little held back, little left 
to the imagination. When they rant about a vendor or a product they don’t 
like, they go all out. Also, bloggers love to link to and comment on one 
another’s blogs in a particular market space, so true conversations develop. 
Arguments, discussions, reviews, comparisons — read influential bloggers’ 
posts and you’ll quickly feel the pulse of a market segment’s desires. 
How do you find the blogs and blog posts relevant to your business using? 
Technorati is the most useful search engine for blogs.
Technorati
Go to www.technorati.com, and enter your keyword phrase in the search 
box at the top, and hit Return. Then filter the results on the next page by 
selecting “A Lot of Authority” from the drop-down list.
This search often returns a list of often-influential blogs that deal with your 
market. The list in Figure 4-16 shows several blogs that write about home 
gym equipment. If you’re selling home gym equipment, go visit them (by 
clicking their URL) and find out what they’re ranting about and what’s tickling 
their fancy. Pay attention to visitor comments, if any (few comments proba-
bly means few readers and not much influence), and follow the blogroll — the 
list of blogs that this blog thinks is important.
The third listing for Home Gym Equipment is a post called “6 Ways to Create 
a Great Home Gym For Less.” Technorati assigns an authority score of 925 to 
this blog, which means something only in comparison to other blogs ranked 
by Technorati.
You should filter the results by authority (a measure of how many other blogs 
link to that blog) to weed out insignificant blogs. Because the Blogosphere 
represents a network, you can usually find your way to the center of that 
network just by observing who’s quoting whom. Blogging expert Dave Taylor 
(of www.askdavetaylor.com) likens the Blogosphere to a giant party. The 
person in the middle of the room surrounded by gaping hangers-on is prob-
ably the most influential person. Sidle over to that group and you’ll learn a 
lot about your market. On the other hand, you can also find blogs that don’t 
link to other blogs, that just try to sell you stuff, that rant and rave but have 
no influence whatsoever. That’s like a person loudly talking at a party, but no 
one is listening.

Loitering on Web sites
Your competitors’ Web sites are great places to learn what to do and what 
not to do. When I talked about bid persistence earlier in this chapter, I 
advised you to print a list of the top AdWords advertisers in your market 
three times over six weeks. Grab those printouts now and circle the Web sites 
that appear on all three pages — both the sponsored and organic listings. It’s 
time to hang out with successful businesses and see what they’re up to.
First, look at your competitor’s Web site as if you’re a potential customer. Can 
you find what you’re looking for? Does the site confuse or bore you? Is it easy 
to contact the site owner and ask questions? Do you trust the site? Can you 
order easily?
 
Remember that the home page may not be the landing page you get to by 
clicking its ad. Check out its landing page and see how it draws you in — or 
not. Pay attention to how that landing page connects to the rest of the site. 
Does it try to make a sale or to capture your contact information? What are 
the featured products? What are its shipping and return policies?

77
 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
Also, do other sites link to your competitor’s Web site? Google loves sites 
with a lot of inbound links. You can find out who’s linking to a Web site by 
typing link: and then the URL at www.yahoo.com (for some reason, Yahoo 
does a much better job of reporting links than Google). The link: search 
takes you to Yahoo’s very useful Site Explorer. In Figure 14-17, for example, 
link:www.monkeybargym.com returns 1392 linking pages A high number 
of inbound links helps increase their organic Google traffic — as well as 
decrease their PPC bid prices by increasing quality score.

Explorer to

many sites 
are linking

Sleeping with the enemy
But wait, there’s more! Don’t just float around on your competitors’ sites — if 
you can afford it, become their customer. Get into their sales funnel. Discover 
how they treat their customers, and whether (and how) they try to grow the 
relationship. You may discover that their initial sale is a loss leader — that is, 
they lose money on the front end because they have an effective system for 
selling additional products on the back end.
Do they send e-mail offers for additional products? Do they give coupon 
codes for dollars off? Do they request feedback? Do they ship promptly? Does 
the merchandise do what they say it does?

78
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
 
So what do you do if your competitors do everything right? Here’s a little 
online marketing secret: Your competitors are also your best potential busi-
ness partners. If you can figure out how to share customers, everyone can 
increase profits by promoting different offers to different market segments. 
You can play nice with competitors only when you can figure out ways to dif-
ferentiate yourself from them.
Cutting Through the Clutter 
with Positioning
You know how big your potential market is. You know how hungry they are. 
You’ve discovered what they care about — and what frustrates them about 
the existing situation and options. You’ve figured out what kind of pricing 
structure and market response you need to be profitable. And you’ve scoped 
out the competition to see what needs are not yet being filled.
Armed with this information, you’re now ready to construct the most impor-
tant sentence in the life of your business: your positioning statement.
 
Marketing master Ken McCarthy (TheSystemSeminar.com) explains position-
ing this way:
Successful marketing is a multi-dimensional process. What do I mean by 
that? Remember the three-dimensional chess board featured on Star Trek? 
Instead of one board and two dimensions, there were multiple boards on 
different levels and pieces could move up and down in space as well as 
backwards and forwards.
Many advertisers obsess about THEIR product and THEIR advertising. That’s 
all well and good, but what these business owners fail to include in their 
calculations is the total space of the market they hope to enter. Rarely do 
prospects see only your product and your advertising. They’re usually aware 
of other offers that — on the surface — appear similar to yours. Further, 
because we’re all so busy and have so many things on our minds, we don’t 
have a lot of extra processing power to think deeply about any company’s 
offer.
Here’s the key: You can’t expect your prospects to do any heavy mental 
lifting. If it’s not crystal clear why your offer is unique, it will be added to the 
rummage sale pile in their minds where all the other products go that they 
don’t quite understand and will probably never buy.

79
 Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market
Your goal as a business is very simple: You want your offer to occupy a 
completely unique place in the cubbyhole system of your prospect’s mind 
and you want to figure out how to telegraph that unique value in seconds.
Better marketing and advertising is not just about building a better mouse-
trap (or creating a better ad), it’s about figuring out where your offer fits in 
the market space and why you’re uniquely qualified to hold a place in it, 
then communicating that message simply and powerfully, over and over 
again.
Let me give you two examples of how this works. The ultimate romantic city 
destination for lovers — what place pops into your mind? Probably Paris.
An innovative computer hardware company that’s especially friendly to 
creative types — which company is already there staking out that space? 
Probably Apple.
A good rule of thumb is that there’s probably only one space per category in 
everyone’s mind. Second place is the same as last place.
Your mission as a smart marketer is to go boldly where few marketers tread 
and figure out what place your offer can own and then make sure every ad 
you run reinforces that message. Positioning is the thing that separates the 
marketers who are standing on the winner’s platform from the ones who are 
perennially treading water.
Your ad copy, your Web site, your e-mails, the way you answer your tele-
phone — all these marketing elements must flow out of your positioning. The 
easiest way to establish top positioning is to carve a market segment that no 
one else has claimed. For example, there are many competing merchants in 
the fitness space. That niche is far too big to attack with limited resources. 
What about home gym equipment? Also big — and full of established com-
petitors. What about home gym equipment for parents with young children? 
Indoor playgrounds the size of a home gym that both parents and toddlers 
can enjoy safely — and that parents can use for a real workout while watch-
ing their kids? No company I’ve ever heard of has told that story before. If 
your research tells you that parents with young children are frustrated about 
their exercise options, you may stake your fitness-industry positioning on 
catering to that market. You may find that your initial idea doesn’t fly — they 
don’t have enough room in their house for a gym that big, or they doubt that 
it’s safe for kids. But as you watch the market, you’ll discover things they will 
search for and buy. And your positioning, based on those discoveries, will 
make you the obvious choice when they see your Google ad.
Ken McCarthy likens online market research to sitting next to a busy road 
and watching the cars go by. First you find the potholes, by seeing what 
people want and aren’t getting. Then you create products and marketing mes-
sages to fill those potholes.

Choosing the Right Keywords
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the importance of keywords
▶ Reading your prospects’ minds through their search behavior
▶ Discovering tools for keyword research
▶ Mastering keyword formats and variations
▶ Sorting your keywords into ad groups
▶ Discouraging the “wrong” people from visiting your site
▶ Increasing traffic by discovering new keywords
You’re in control of most parts of your online marketing. You write your 
ads. You design and create your Web site. You write checks for adver-
tising. You set your prices, hours of operation, and policies. But one of the 
most important elements of your online strategy isn’t created by you at all, 
but by your prospects: the keywords they use to search for your solution to 
their problem. Your job isn’t to invent keywords, but to identify the keywords 
they’re already typing. If you can’t find those keywords, the AdWords game is 
over before it starts. No keywords means no impressions, no clicks, no leads, 
no sales.
After you’ve discovered those keywords, however, your job isn’t over. Now 
you have to figure out “the want behind the word.” Each keyword represents 
a different mindset — a different set of assumptions about how to fulfill a 
need, and a different state of buying readiness. For example, the singular and 
plural keywords can imply huge differences. Someone searching for used 
car is probably closer to buying than someone who types used cars. The 
plural searchers typically are at the early stages of their quest, whereas the 
singular searchers have, in their minds, a picture of one item that they’ll buy 
when they find it.

82
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
I use the singular/plural example because it’s surprising, perhaps, that one 
letter can make such a big difference. Other keyword variations, such as 
synonyms, are equally significant:
 
✓ car versus auto
 
✓ used versus pre-owned
If you’ve ever received high-quality sales training, you know to pay attention 
to prospect cues and clues before making your pitch. You might steer one 
prospect to a 1958 MG convertible, a second to a 2001 Odyssey minivan, and 
a third to a 2009 Toyota Prius. With AdWords, your prospects’ keywords are 
your only initial clues to their innermost desires. Different keywords trigger 
different ads, take prospects to different landing pages, and make them differ-
ent offers.
This chapter shows you how to interpret keywords to help you read your 
prospects’ minds. Armed with this fundamental understanding, you discover 
how to conduct keyword research to find the words and phrases that will 
bring you qualified search traffic. You discover how to manage your keyword 
lists in AdWords, separating them into ad groups and using the positive and 
negative keyword formats to get as many good prospects as possible while 
discouraging nonbuyers from seeing and clicking your ads.
Decoding Keywords to Read 
Your Prospects’ Minds
The golden rule of marketing, in my book (hey, this is my book — cool!), was 
first articulated by Robert Collier in his 1934 book, The Robert Collier Letter 
Book: “Join the conversation already going on in your prospects’ mind.” His 
example: If you want to sell a winter coat to a man walking down the street 
talking with a friend, don’t jump out and interrupt him with a statement 
about what a great winter coat you have here. Instead, start walking along 
with the pair, listening and nodding at their conversation. Here and there ask 
a question, offer a relevant comment, and watch for an opening. When talk 
comes around to vacations, steer it gently to trips to cold climates. When 
your prospect is primed, you can show him your coat. (Please remember 
that’s a metaphor, not a suggestion to lurk in doorways and stalk strangers!)
Because Google has not (yet) hooked up electrodes to our brains while we 
browse the Web, the keyword is your best guide to the conversation already 
going on in your prospects’ heads.

83
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
Perry Marshall of www.perrymarshall.com is fond of saying that every 
keyword represents an unscratched itch. You search to solve a problem. 
Maybe you literally itch and are looking for an ointment. Maybe you’re bored 
and are looking for excitement. Maybe you’re worried and looking for peace 
of mind. Maybe you accidentally dropped your cell phone in a cup of coffee. 
Maybe you want to find a summer camp for your kid. Whatever it is, the 
fact that you’re searching means you don’t have enough information to take 
action immediately. A gap exists between what you know and what you need 
to know in order to make a decision.
A nifty Web portal created by Seth Godin, www.squidoo.com, says it well:
We believe that when you go online, you don’t search. You don’t even find. 
Instead, you are usually on a quest to make sense.
That’s the goal of most visits to Google or Yahoo! or blogs or Wikipedia. 
How do you make sense of the noise that’s coming at you from all 
directions?
You won’t take action, you won’t buy something, book something, hire 
someone, or take a position on a political issue until you’ve made sense of 
your options.
Searching online should really be called poking online. Because that’s what 
you do. You poke around. You poke in Google and you poke at some ads. 
After looking at a bunch of links and pages, then, finally, you get it. You 
understand enough to take action — to buy something or make a decision.
Your mission as an AdWords advertiser is to help your prospects make 
sense of their options. And to do it faster and more completely than anyone 
else. The word client comes from the Middle Ages, where it originally meant, 
“person seeking the protection or influence of someone powerful.” Think of 
yourself as the expert in your market, the protector of the hordes of confused 
seekers, the one who will take your prospects by the hand and guide them 
through the hype and confusion and lies, and take them to the promised land 
of clarity and truth.
Squidoo’s description suggests that “poking” is often inefficient because the 
searchers encounter lots of false starts and dead ends, confusion, frustration, 
and mistrust. What if you could figure out, just by the keywords they used, 
where your prospects are and what paths they need to follow to achieve under-
standing? Then you become their protector, and they become your clients — 
trusting you to show them the next piece of information they need to make a 
decision and act on it. That’s the ultimate goal of your AdWords strategy — to 
show each prospect that you understand him or her, and can give them what 
they want each step of the way — including the part where they pull out a 
credit card and pay you for it. You achieve this goal by finding out how to inter-
pret keywords. Your best teachers are Google, your own practice of empathy, 
and the data you collect.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Learn from Google
Google won the search-engine wars, in part, because it got very good at figur-
ing out what people were looking for based on what they were typing. And 
the more data Google collects, the smarter it gets. Every time you perform a 
Google search and click a link, Google follows you and adds your actions to 
its database. It knows which sites you visit as part of your search. It knows 
how long you stay and how many pages you browse. If the advertiser has 
installed Google Analytics, conversion tracking, or a Web site optimizer, 
Google knows whether you’ve signed up for a mailing list, or bought some-
thing, and even how much you spent. The next time someone searches on 
that or a similar keyword, Google tweaks the search results to reflect what 
you told Google through your actions.
To fully appreciate the differences that Google has discovered, try this 
experiment: Perform a search on any keyword and print the first page of 
search results. Then search for a synonym and print that page. Compare the 
two pages — what percentage of the listings has changed? For example, try 
searching for vermiculture and then its synonym worm farming.
If you take the time to visit the landing pages on each results page, you’ll dis-
cover something of what Google knows about the mindset difference between 
vermiculture and worm farming. Perhaps one group is professional, 
whereas the other is made up of amateurs. Maybe vermiculturists are just 
worm farmers with more education and higher credit limits. Could be that 
vermiculturists are into composting, whereas worm farmers are into selling 
fish bait. (If I didn’t have 12 more chapters to write — and had some worm-
farming supplies to sell — I might spend the time to find out.)
If you’re preparing to advertise your business on Google, researching the key-
word differences in your market will significantly increase your chances for 
success.
Decision mindset
Perform Google searches for the top keywords in your market and scan the 
results for clues. In particular, look for clues about what values will dominate 
their decision-making process. What data will they consider before making a 
decision, and how will they evaluate and prioritize that data? What’s the first 
question they need answered to alleviate feelings of impatience, confusion, or 
frustration?
The following subsections help you determine your potential customers’ 
mindsets.

85
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
Buyer or tirekicker
Are they serious about buying or just fantasizing? Big mansion sounds 
like a dream, whereas 9 BR Colonial Princeton NJ looks like a serious 
quest.
Market-savvy or innocent beginner
Are they familiar with standard industry terms or new to the industry? For 
example, whenever I go to the home-improvement store, I have to describe 
the tool or part I’m looking for with lots of hand gestures, analogies, and facial 
contortions because I don’t know the name of anything in the store except for 
hammer, Snickers bar, and toilet-bowl flange (please excuse me as I process 
this flashback). Whether I walk out with a frown or a ratcheting 11mm box 
wrench depends on the patience, empathy, and experience of the clerk I 
manage to find hiding in Aisle 53. (Do they hide from you, too, or it is just me?)
For example, someone who wants to make their own beer might search for 
beer making or homebrew. The very fact that some folks are familiar with 
the “insider” term homebrew suggests they’re at least somewhat market-savvy. 
The savvier the prospect, the more knowledgeable you must appear about the 
market and the product choices. Even experts are looking for leadership.
Discretionary or nondiscretionary purchase
How badly does your prospect want or need what you have? How hard do 
you have to work to convince that person to buy? Imagine a long sales letter, 
an e-mail follow-up course, a video demonstration, and an hour of audio tes-
timonials for . . . a box of large paper clips. Overkill. Paper clips are an office 
necessity, needed when they’re needed. Compare that to motivational post-
ers for the office, a product that didn’t even exist until some entrepreneur 
figured out that managers are lousy at motivating employees and would pay 
money to get a picture to do it for them.
Problem-conscious or solution-conscious
For example, get more clients represents the problem (not enough 
clients), whereas CRM software (CRM stands for Customer Relationship 
Management) is one solution to that problem. Your ads can focus on prob-
lems (empathizing, agitating) or solutions (describing, proving, advocating). 
Remember: Join the conversation already going on in your prospect’s mind.
Suppose that every prospect is searching for a solution, and you have a com-
peting solution to the same problem. In that case, start by talking about the 
solution they’re already thinking of. My Leads into Gold campaign does this 
with prospects searching for cold calling scripts. One ad headline 
reads, “Stop cold calling.” Another: “Cold Calling Doesn’t Work.” You can also 
raise questions about the solution: “Does Cold Calling Work?” Or position 
yourself as an expert above the fray: “Cold calling scripts compared.”

86
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Solution-conscious shoppers think they know what they need but are often 
wrong. To the extent that your ads and Web site can educate them through 
a consultative approach, you can shift them away from preconceptions that 
are limiting their thinking. Problem-conscious shoppers typically open their 
minds to a broader array of solutions.
Price shopping or feature shopping
If someone searches for Canon PowerShot SX10 IS 10 MP 20X Zoom 
you can bet they’re looking for a price, shipping info, and a store they can 
trust. Compare that to a search for 10 MP SLR digital camera — which 
indicates more of an interest in general camera types (and possibly price 
ranges) than in specific brands and features.
Need it now or planning for future need
Your prospects’ time frame is important because you always have a choice 
to send them to a “buy now” page, or a “sign up for my 56-day e-mail course” 
page. Don’t pitch a course on avoiding plumbing emergencies to someone 
with a busted pipe flooding their basement. And don’t try, on the landing 
page, to sell a luxury beachfront property in Tasmania to someone searching 
for retirement property.
Sale or information
As I mention earlier in this chapter (unless you’re reading it backward, in 
which case “retpahc siht ni retal noitnem I sa”), singular and plural keywords 
often point to big differences in desired outcome. Someone ready to buy a 
pet cockatiel, for example, would probably begin with cockatiel rather 
than with cockatiels. Someone just doing research on longevity, tricks, and 
annoying habits would be more likely to begin with the plural.
Practice thinking like your prospect
Following the Google trail is a start. The next step is to put yourself into your 
prospect’s head, walk a mile in his moccasins, see through his eyes, and feel 
through his kidneys (or whatever), for all of them and each of them.
Why did they type those particular search terms at that moment? What 
went through their minds during the seven seconds prior to the search? 
What were the triggers? How long have they been thinking about this prob-
lem? What tasks did they just interrupt to conduct this search? What environ-
mental distractions are competing for their attention right now?

87
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
Who are they? What do they care about? What are their hopes, fears, dreams? 
What are their deepest, most secret desires? Can I stop writing romance-
novel back-cover teaser questions?
 
The practice of market empathy is one of the hardest marketing tasks you’ll 
ever have to accomplish. Before you can pretend to be someone else, you first 
have to pretend you aren’t you. You, after all, are a very small but very loud 
market sample, and the more you listen to yourself, the less room you have in 
your brain for thinking about others. When you think your prospect is the 
same as you, the “Market to Yourself Syndrome” follows: You speak in industry 
jargon, you assume everyone knows the purpose, history, and significance of 
your product, and you believe everyone can see the dramatic differences 
between your product and the competition. Because it’s obvious you’re talk-
ing to yourself, your prospects politely ignore you.
The more words in the keyword phrase, the more information you have about 
your prospect. Look at the following four-word keywords, each including the 
words treatment for gout. What differences might exist in the minds of 
the three different searchers?
 
✓ natural treatment for gout
 
✓ alternative treatment for gout
 
✓ symptom treatment for gout
I’m intrigued by the difference between natural and alternative — the two 
terms overlap a lot. I feel the alternative seeker is more desperate than the 
natural seeker. Natural implies high standards, whereas alternative tells me 
that conventional treatments haven’t worked. Symptom may be a quick-fix 
tell, a searcher who wants immediate relief rather than to address the root 
causes.
What can you do with this information? If my livelihood depended on selling 
as much stuff as I could to these three people, I might craft my ad pitches 
accordingly:

effects

My landing page would immediately indicate that I understand them. For 
example:

gout
“Are you worried about the side effects from 
the pills your doctor prescribed for your gout 
flare-ups? Want to be drug-free? Want to pre-
vent future attacks naturally?”

“You’ve tried the drugs, and they didn’t work. 
You wonder whether Western medicine really 
knows how to treat gout. Your doctor just 
keeps prescribing higher doses of the same 
stuff. Want to get off the drug treadmill com-
pletely and discover a treatment that attacks 
the causes of gout, not just the symptoms?”
symptom treatment for 
gout
“You live in fear of a sudden onset of pain-
ful symptoms, and you’re always wondering 
when your next attack will occur. Instead of 
treating the symptoms when you’re already in 
agony, want to learn how to prevent flare-ups 
in the future?”
Mastering the Three Positive 
Keyword Formats
You can’t possibly guess all the variations of keywords your prospects will 
type when they’re trying to find you. Fortunately, Google doesn’t force you 
to be specific, although it allows you to be. AdWords lets you input positive 
keywords (that is, keywords that trigger your ad, as opposed to negative key-
words that prevent your ad from showing) three different ways: broad match, 
phrase match, and exact match. They look like this:
 
✓ Broad match: Buddha statue
 
✓ Phrase match: “Buddha statue”
 
✓ Exact match: [Buddha statue]

89
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
Broad match
Broad match keywords show your ad when the actual keyword is similar to 
yours. Buddha statue shows for the following actual searches (note the dif-
ferences in spelling and capitalization):
 
✓ Buddha statue
 
✓ statue of the Buddha
 
✓ Buddah statue
 
✓ Korean statue of buddha
 
✓ Buddhist statues
Broad-match keywords are useful when you don’t know what people are 
searching for, and you want to make sure you capture all relevant searches. 
The downsides of broad matching are the inability to match ad copy to the 
keyword, as well as lower CTR (click-through rates) and higher bid prices.
Phrase match
Putting the broad match in double quotes converts it to phrase match, mean-
ing the characters between the quotes must appear exactly as they are 
somewhere in the actual search. “Buddha statue” matches the following 
searches:
 
✓ Buddha statue
 
✓ “Buddha Statue”
 
✓ Chinese Buddha statue
 
✓ grinning Buddha statue
Phrase matches generally have higher CTR and lower CPC (cost-per-click) 
than broad matches because they eliminate synonyms and changes in tense, 
number, and order. The most accurate matching occurs with the third syntax: 
exact matching.

90
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Exact match
You indicate an exact match with square brackets, generally found to the 
right of the P key on your keyboard. [Buddha statue] will show only for 
the following searches:
 
✓ Buddha statue
 
✓ buddha Statue
 
✓ “Buddha statue”
Exact-match keywords are the most precise. You know exactly what the 
searcher typed when you register an exact match impression.
If you include the broad, phrase, and exact matches of the same keyword 
in your ad group, phrase trumps broad — and exact trumps both. In other 
words, if your keyword list includes
 
✓ Buddha statue
 
✓ “Buddha statue”
 
✓ [Buddha statue]
and someone searches for life-sized Buddha statue, that searcher 
triggers the phrase match (in quotes), but not the broad or exact match. And 
Buddha statue triggers the exact match.
The goal: From vague to specific
Exact match is a powerful way to exclude searches you don’t want to attract. 
But it’s a double-edged sword — exact match can also eliminate searches you 
do want, but haven’t thought of yet. In a perfect AdWorld, the vast majority 
of your traffic comes from exact matches (because you know what your pros-
pects are thinking and typing) and you still capture other relevant searches. 
When you start advertising on AdWords, you may not have enough traffic for 
your exact matches, so you’ll have to use broad- and phrase-match keywords 
for a while. If you keep track of the actual search terms people use to get to 
your Web site (see the later section, “Using your server log to get smarter”), 
you can replace broad-match keywords with the exact keywords that trig-
gered your ads.
Over time, you replace keyword guesswork with precise knowledge. For exam-
ple, Kerry Nesbit offers logos for veterinary practices at www.veterinary
logos.com. Her main keywords, when she began the campaign, were 

91
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
veterinary logos and veterinarian logos. She soon discovered, via the logs on 
her Web server, that Google was showing her ads to people searching with 
similar intent, but different language: 
 
✓ animal hospital logos
 
✓ veterinary clinic logos
 
✓ vet hospital logos
 
✓ dvm logos
After you start seeing these searches in your server log or Search Query 
Report (see Chapter 14), you add them as broad-match and exact-match key-
words. The number of impressions for veterinary logos goes down as 
these keywords pick up the slack. Eventually, you may be able to retire your 
broad-match keywords entirely.
“Why would I want to retire my broad-match keywords?” I hear you ask. 
Kerry found that Google’s broad match was often, er, a bit too broad. Her ads 
were also being shown for such searches as:
 
✓ animal symbols
 
✓ medical emblem
 
✓ veterinary marquee
 
✓ Vietnam vet burn signs
 
✓ signs of canine pregnancy
Yikes! Obviously, none of these searches represents a serious prospect for 
graphic design for a veterinary practice. If you were Kerry, would you want 
to show your ad to people who want to know whether their dog is expecting? 
If not, you’re attracting the wrong prospects — and needlessly lowering your 
CTR and quality score, and increasing your bid price for clicks. So how can 
you turn off your ad for these searchers? One solution, which I cover later in 
this chapter, is the use of negative keywords. You can add -pregnancy to 
your keyword list to tell Google, “Hide my ad if pregnancy is in the keyword.”
By monitoring the actual phrases that trigger visits to your site (via the 
Search Query Report), you eventually can eliminate many irrelevant searches 
by choosing only the keywords that qualified prospects are typing.
I show you how to move from vague to specific keywords later in this chap-
ter, in the “Sorting Keywords into Ad Groups” section.

92
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Researching Keywords: 
Strategies and Tools
In the perfect AdWords campaign, every click leads to a sale and you don’t 
miss any clicks that could have led to a sale. In real life, of course, such a per-
fect campaign is impossible. But it’s the goal of everything you’re doing. Your 
keyword selection represents a balancing act between hyper-aggressive and 
hyper-conservative:
 
✓ Hyper-aggressive: If you choose every keyword in the universe, you 
won’t miss anybody, but your CTR will be microscopic and your bid 
prices will be astronomical.
 
✓ Hyper-conservative: If you bid only on the very obvious keywords, 
you’ll miss a lot of sales from prospects who approach the search 
process differently from you.
The ideal balance point is the one that maximizes your business goals, what-
ever they are. If you’re advertising a for-profit business, your goal may simply 
be the highest possible profits. You may sacrifice some profits for quality of 
life and go for the highest ROI. If you’re building a company to sell, you may 
prefer to build a huge subscriber base to earning profits up front.
Whatever the goal, the same three-part strategy applies:
 
1. Start with the obvious keywords.
 
 Make a list of the keywords you’d search if you were your customer.
 
2. From there, go laterally into synonyms and related searches.
 
 Conduct the research described in Chapter 4, use the Google Keyword 
Tool, and one or more of the tools described a little later in this chapter.
 
3. Tweak or fire underperforming keywords — and keep looking for new ones.
Part III shows you how to manage your AdWords campaigns to continually 
improve your results.
Eventually, you’ll have a stable of reliably profitable keywords pointing to the 
appropriate ads, taking visitors to effective Web sites.
The Google Keyword Tool
You can use the Google Keyword Tool (which I mention in Chapter 4 in the 
section on the size and health of your online market) at www.askhowie.
com/kwtool to generate related search terms. Simply type the main keyword 
in the box (this time keeping the Use Synonyms option selected) and click 

93
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
the Get Keyword Ideas button to receive a list of related terms. For example, 
a search for used cars produced synonyms, such as used suvs and sec-
ondhand cars among dozens of others. You can explore the keyword land-
scape and download keywords to your computer in a file that you can open 
in a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets.
Another use for the Google Keyword Tool is to search Web sites for keyword 
ideas. At the top, select the Website Content radio button and enter the URL 
of a site related to your keyword. For example, edmunds.com returned the 
following keyword families: used car (31 variations), new car (23), car 
price (7), invoice price (9), car dealer (6), for sale (6), car (51), 
dealer (14), and auto (17).
Google has a Search-based Keyword Tool (see Chapter 9 for the scoop on all 
the free Google tools in your account) specifically designed to give you key-
word ideas from your Web site, but it doesn’t work very well yet. Stick to the 
main Keyword Tool until you hear differently from me.
Thesaurus tools
Remember the frantic high-school-essay writer’s best friend, Roget’s 
Thesaurus? It got you through some pretty rough papers by giving you 12 
ways to say accomplish and 19 ways to say want. (Although my history 
teacher thought hanker too colloquial and prefer too wishy-washy.) Well, the 
old thesaurus is now online, in two free incarnations, and can lead you to key-
words you’d otherwise miss.
Online Thesaurus
Go to http://thesaurus.reference.com to access the online version of 
Roget’s New Millennium™ Thesaurus. Type your keyword (one word, generally) 
into the text box near the top of the page and click the Search button.
For example, when you type the keyword insurance, one of the synonyms, 
coverage, can open a huge new set of keywords. Just about anywhere you 
can use insurance, you can now use coverage:
 
✓ health insurance and its synonym health coverage
 
✓ automobile insurance Omaha Nebraska and its synonym auto-
mobile coverage Omaha Nebraska
Every synonym in the online thesaurus is hyperlinked to a list of its synonyms. 
Clicking coverage takes you to another set of results for compensation.
 
For your purposes, the majority of thesaurus results are irrelevant. Look for 
words that jog your brain into thinking, “Oh, that’s a good keyword, too.”

Quintura.com
Quintura.com is a visual thesaurus that shows you, at a glance, the major 
themes in a market. Figure 5-1 shows the search themes related to veterinary 
logos in a word cloud on the left, whereas the Yahoo! search results appear 
on the right. The cloud immediately suggests a couple of additional keyword 
groups, veterinary clinic logos and veterinary practice logos, as well as 
phrases with brochure and design.
If you sell logo design services to veterinarians, several of the results of this 
Quintura search will point you in promising directions (clinic and prac-
tice, for example), whereas others will help you brainstorm negative key-
words (see the later section, “Deploying Negative Keywords”).

While you’re showing the search options, also take a few minutes to explore 
Google’s Related Searches feature. At the top of the page, Google shows you 

95
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
a list of searches that relate to your keyword. Many include your keyword 
within them, but others are semantically related (that is, they are connected 
by meaning, not by words). For example, a related search for The Beatles 
returns the names of the Fab Four, Bob Dylan, Across the Universe, the Beach 
Boys, and the Doors. Google is revealing what people who searched for The 
Beatles also searched for within the same session.

KeywordSpy.com
If you’re serious about using AdWords, KeywordSpy.com is one of several paid 
tools I recommend highly. Go to www.keywordspy.com, type a keyword in the 
search box, and click the Search button. In the Paid Keywords tab of results, 
you’re shown to a list of Web sites bidding on that keyword, as shown in Figure 
5-3. Click any of the Web site links to see a long list of their other keywords.
In other words, if your competitor has done a good job of researching key-
words, you can use this sneaky tool to take advantage of all their hours of 
hard work. If you need to compete against established competitors in an 
AdWords market, this tool is a no-brainer.
Using your server log to get smarter
Quietly, uncomplainingly, your Web site has been storing a gold mine of visitor 
data, patiently waiting for you to realize its value. If your Web site has been 
welcoming visitors for any length of time and you haven’t perused your server 
log yet, you’re in for a treat. Among lots of other useful data, your server log 
will tell you exactly what search terms visitors typed to land on your site. All 

96
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
the tools I’ve talked about in this section are useful as idea generators — but 
your server log tells you exactly what keywords are already getting people to 
your site. (Once you start driving AdWords traffic, you can run search query 
reports to find out the exact search phrases entered by your visitors.)
 
Figure 5-3: 
Keyword
Spy.com 
returns a list 
of Web sites 
currently 
bidding on 
the same 
keyword.
 
Because Web servers differ significantly, unfortunately I can’t tell you exactly 
how to find and read your own server logs. If you’re technically savvy about 
your Web site, you already know where to find the server log. If you’re not 
sure how to view your server logs, contact your hosting provider.
What you want to look for in your server logs are the key phrases and key-
words that people typed into a search engine just before visiting your site. 
You want to select a reporting period that makes sense (last month, last year, 
and so on). Figure 5-4 shows the server logs for key phrases and keywords 
that lead visitors to my site, www.leadsintogold.com, for one year. Most 
of the keywords you find this way are “long-tail” — lots of rarely searched 
variations (see the next paragraph). Occasionally you can discover a high-
traffic keyword this way. Mostly, I use this information to add negative key-
words — words that disqualify the searcher as a prospect — and thereby 
save money by avoiding unprofitable clicks. 

97
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
 
Figure 5-4: 
My server 
log shows 
me rarely

keywords 
that have 
brought visi-
tors to my 
Web site.
 
Long-tail keywords refer to phrases that are rarely typed and will therefore 
bring you very few visitors, but collectively can generate many sales. The 
concept of the long tail (the phrase itself refers to the shape of the graph of 
the statistical distribution of events) was popularized in the book The Long 
Tail, by Chris Anderson, who argued that in a digital world with no produc-
tion or shipping costs, the combined profits generated by long-tail products 
can be greater than the profits from the blockbuster bestsellers. Amazon.
com, for example, can be more profitable than brick and mortar bookstores 
because such a large proportion of Amazon’s sales come from obscure books 
that physical stores wouldn’t be able to stock due to shelf space limits.
 
Before 2009, one way to win the AdWords game was to add as many long-tail 
keywords as possible. The long-tail keywords were often cheaper, with less 
competition. Google changed the game, however, by disqualifying keywords 
with low search volume. Now, if you want your ad to appear when someone 
searches for red canon camera that takes great pictures of lorikeets, you just 
bid on “red canon camera” in phrase match and hope Google takes care of 
the rest.

Finding Sneaky Variations 
for Fun and Profit
So far you’ve been looking at semantic variations — keywords with simi-
lar but slightly different meanings. Now you can explore the wide world of 
sneaky variations — slight keyword tweaks that can mean the difference 
between lackluster and sizzling campaigns.
Some quick ways to vary keywords
For openers, here are a couple of simple sources of keyword variation — 
geographic location and human typographical error:
 
✓ Geography: As you saw in the used Toyota trucks example, key-
words sometimes include geographical terms. If you ship home gym 
equipment anywhere in the U.S., you want to capture searches for home 
gym Alaska to home gym Vermont. You may even want to get more 
granular than the state level: home gym Chicago and Chicago home 
gym.
 
✓ Misspellings: Let’s face it — everyone couldn’t win the spelling bee 
in elementary school. And people often type so quickly, they mess up 
wodrs and phraess (oops) while they search. Don’t take my word for 
it — check out this hilarious page, courtesy of Google, that lists the mis-
spelled searches for Britney Spears over a three-month period:
www.google.com/jobs/britney.html
If you bid on misspellings that your competitors ignore, you have a twofold 
advantage:
 
✓ Significantly decreased competition: When I search for low choles-
terol recipes in Google, I find eight sponsored listings. When I enter 
low cholesterol recipies I see only one. Ten advertisers, includ-
ing heavyweight Lipitor.com (a Pfizer Web site about its cholesterol med-
ication), did not think to show their ad for a common misspelling. You 
have a much higher chance of compelling a click if you’re in a beauty 
pageant against only one or two other competitors.
 
✓ Lower CPC: With less competition, you don’t have to bid as much to 
appear on the coveted first page. In the low cholesterol recipies 
example, the misspelled keyword costs about half as much as the cor-
rectly spelled term.

 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
 
Misspellings won’t generate huge search traffic. The Britney Spears example 
shows the correct spelling receiving almost half a million searches, and the 
most popular misspelling (britanny) getting 10 percent of that. Most of the mis-
spelled keywords (have you ever noticed how the word misspelled just doesn’t 
look right?) occurred four times or fewer. The goal in using misspellings isn’t 
to double your traffic. Instead, it’s to lower your average cost of customer acqui-
sition. The goal of the AdWords game — as with a lot of business — is to turn 
cheap raw materials (in this case, clicks) into valuable products (in this case, 
hungry customers with working credit cards). You can use misspellings to 
lower your average CPC slightly and increase your traffic slightly, which gives 
you slightly more money to spend on advertising and slightly more traffic to 
run through your split testing machine (see Chapter 13) — and become 
slightly better at turning visitors into customers. The cumulative effect of all 
these slight advantages is enough to snowball into market dominance.
Different versions
If you sell different versions of the same basic product, you’ll improve your 
CTR by including specific search terms. A business selling light bulbs might 
bid on the following general terms:
 
✓ fluorescent light bulb
 
✓ compact fluorescent light bulb
 
✓ flood light
 
✓ floodlight
 
✓ lightbulb
 
✓ flourescent bulb
Their customers may be searching for much more specific items:
 
✓ 36” fluorescent light bulb
 
✓ dimmable compact fluorescent light bulb
 
✓ 14 watt compact fluorescent light bulb
 
✓ red 150 watt flood light
 
✓ green 150 watt flood light
 
If you sell 20 different colors or shapes or sizes or types of a product, be sure 
to include all those variables in your keyword list. Google may disqualify some 
or even most of the longer, more specific keywords, but any you can keep will 
increase your relevance and lower your average cost per click.

Different points of view
A realtor may advertise for the keyword real estate Carrboro NC 
and miss the following keywords that include the perspective of different 
searchers:
 
✓ buy real estate Carrboro NC
 
✓ buying real estate Carrboro NC
 
✓ sell real estate Carrboro NC
 
✓ selling real estate Carrboro NC
 
✓ looking for real estate Carrboro NC
 
✓ shopping for real estate Carrboro NC
 
✓ house hunting real estate Carrboro NC
A regular verb and a gerund (the verb with -ing at the end) can signify com-
pletely different mindsets. Until you’re sure you don’t want the customer with 
a particular mindset, include them all.
Singular and plural
The difference between a singular and plural word can mean a lot of things. 
Sometimes, people looking for information type the plural (digital cam-
eras), whereas more serious shoppers use the singular (digital camera). 
If the plural keyword is significantly cheaper to bid on than the singular, you 
know that other advertisers have found it harder to make money from the 
less-expensive keyword. If you optimize your sales process to bring the infor-
mation-seeker to the point of purchase, you can take advantage of the cheap, 
plentiful “pre-transaction” keywords such as general plural terms.
.com
Every year, the number of Internet users grows. Because a steady stream of 
Web newbies are searching for your products, you can profit by knowing the 
search “mistakes” they often make. Web neophytes can confuse the Google 
Search box with the address bar (where you type the URL of the Web site). So 
if you sell red flood lights, you can snag some inexpensive traffic by bidding 
on (say) redfloodlights.com.
LowerYourBidPrice.com — sneaky 
keywords made easy
I’ve developed a keyword-manipulation tool, the AdTool, which makes it easy 
to generate thousands of “sneaky” keyword variations from a single keyword. 
You can add U.S. cities and states before and after all your keywords, you can 

101
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
substitute synonyms with the click of a button, you can add hundreds of mis-
spellings, convert singular to plural and vice versa, add .com to the end of 
your keyword, and add quotes and brackets automatically (if you’re as bad a 
typist as I am, this one feature will save you hours).
Let’s say you’ve brainstormed 1,000 keywords that all contain mortgage. 
Now you discover that 5 percent of searchers spell mortgage without a “t” as 
morgage. The AdTool lets you replace mortgage with morgage in all 1,000 
keywords — and add those new 1,000 keywords to your campaigns.
You can also use it to generate hundreds of keyword phrases with the phrase 
combiner. For example, someone who sells collegiate team clothing might 
sell 20 different items (hats, jerseys, sweatshirts, and so on) related to 12 dif-
ferent sports (baseball, basketball, lacrosse, and so on) for 150 colleges and 
universities (Duke, UNC, Princeton, and so on):
20 × 12 × 150 = 36,000 keywords
In Figure 5-5, I’ve included four colleges, five sports, and five items. The 
AdTool instantly generated 209 variations, including two-word phrases like 
Duke hat and Princeton sweatshirt.
The AdTool is available for a full-featured 21-day trial for $3.95 at www.lower
yourbidprice.com. It includes many other features that I don’t want to 
hurt your brain with right now. But because I developed it for my own per-
sonal use, it’s grown to do just about everything I recommend in this book.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Sorting Keywords into Ad Groups
After you’ve generated your keywords, your next step is to organize them 
into ad groups. Your mission, should you choose not to waste money and 
time, is to match your ad closely with the keywords in that group. In the first 
part of this chapter, I emphasize that each keyword has a mindset that goes 
with it. The mindset represents what the searcher wants and how she or he 
wants it; if you put all your keywords into a single ad group, you can’t write 
an ad that will appeal to all those different mindsets. I’ll give you seven rea-
sons to organize your keywords into coherent groups:
 
✓ You can scratch the right itch: Perry Marshall puts it this way: “Think 
of a group of keywords as a bundle of desires. Some desires go together 
better than others. Some are alike and some are very different. Each 
ad group must clump together the most similar desires, so the ad can 
mimic and inflame those desires. You want every one of the people who 
views your ad to say, ‘Yeah, that’s for me.’”
 
 Say you run an online golf store, selling clubs, balls, bags, shoes, 
instructional books and videos, training aids, and so on. You can bid 
on thousands of keywords and send them all to your home page, www.
jimsgolfemporium.com. The keywords could include
 
• golf
 
• golf clubs
 
• putters
 
• golf shoes
 
• improve your golf swing
 
• improve your golf game
 
• correcting a slice in golf
 
 and many others. Each of these keywords represents an “itch.” The 
search results page is nothing other than a race among all the listings to 
scratch that itch first. If your ad is a generic golf ad, you can’t compete 
with an ad that names the itch and promises to scratch it good.
 
 If you had typed left-handed titanium drivers, which headline would 
catch your eye — Golf Clubs and Clothing or Lefty Titanium Drivers?
 
 The big reason to separate similar keywords into ad groups — to show 
an ad that scratches the itch — is supported by other reasons:
 
✓ Google bolds keywords in the search results: Type any word or phrase 
into Google and look at the results page. Every keyword you typed 
(except for a, an, the, for, and suchlike) appears in bold in every listing, 
whether sponsored or organic. Bold text catches the searcher’s eye.

103
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
 
✓ The Quality Score of each keyword depends, in part, on how well it 
matches the ad: Google assigns a Quality Score to each keyword in your 
account, based on click-through rate and how well your ad and landing 
page match the keyword. A poor Quality Score will raise your bid prices 
and make it difficult for you to compete. If you have dozens or hundreds 
of keywords pointing to the same ad, you can’t make them all relevant to 
that ad.
 
✓ Talk to your prospects in their language: If your prospect is searching 
for foods that prevent gout and you put that exact phrase in the 
headline, you’ve scored an empathy point. The way they search is the 
way they talk to themselves. Tap into their lingo and you demonstrate 
understanding.
 
✓ Improve your ads by split testing: If you don’t segment your market, 
you’re missing key split test data. Maybe you have two ads running neck 
and neck (see Chapter 13 for the details on split testing), with a CTR 
of 1.4. In actuality, Ad #1 has a CTR of 3.6 with people who typed tiger 
woods putter and only 0.03 with people who typed golf shoes.
 
✓ Show visitors the right landing page: The golfer searching for left-
handed titanium drivers doesn’t want to land on your home page and 
have to play hide-and-seek with your site navigation. Google has made 
us impatient and lazy — your visitors will go back to Google before 
trying to make their way through a confusing site. With a tight ad group, 
you can send all the traffic to a perfectly matched landing page — either 
for a selection of left-handed titanium drivers, or the best-selling men’s 
and women’s drivers, or an article on how to choose a left-handed tita-
nium driver. The easier you make it for your visitors, the more likely 
they are to follow your lead.
 
✓ Easy campaign management: Managing different ad groups is easier 
than handling one larger group. If your AdWords campaign consists of 
1,000 keywords, all in one ad group, you’ll have a miserable time trying 
to manage that campaign. You’ll have trouble comparing keyword per-
formance because you’ll have too much data to look at. You may end up 
spending time inputting keywords you already have but can’t find.
Divide keywords into concepts
Separating the list of golf keywords into concepts, or “bundles of desires,” you 
get big groups and smaller groups within the big groups. The big buckets are
 
✓ Clubs
 
✓ Accessories
 
✓ Clothing
 
✓ Instruction

104
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
You can divide, say, Clubs into the following categories:
 
✓ Left-handed and right-handed
 
✓ Men’s, women’s, and juniors’
 
✓ Putters, drivers, fairway woods, irons, and wedges
 
✓ Power and accuracy
 
✓ Different brands
The combination of these splits could be the ad groups:
 
✓ Left-handed men’s putters
 
✓ Right-handed women’s drivers
 
✓ Junior fairway woods
For accessories, a big subcategory is “golf balls.” Your ad groups are proba-
bly named for the brands. Pay special attention to the most-searched brands.
Don’t get paralyzed here, looking for the one right way to organize your 
keywords. You can’t know for sure at this point. Your data will help you 
optimize your campaign over time — right now, take your best guesses (the 
market research described in Chapter 4 helps here), and create ad groups 
that are tight enough to be coherent and not so numerous as to defy effec-
tive management.
Spend more time on the high-traffic keywords than the long tails. Think of 
the high-traffic keywords as your prize pumpkins, the ones that can win you 
a gold medal at the state fair. The low-traffic keywords are the apples on the 
trees in the orchard — collectively, they’re valuable, but you couldn’t spend 
ten minutes a day on each apple.
Organizing your keywords
I manage keywords for my AdWords campaigns with three tools: a text editor, 
the AdTool (from www.loweryourbidprice.com), and Microsoft Excel.
Step 1: Collect keywords with a text editor
As I’m doing my initial market research, I just copy and paste all my key-
words into a text file. Your PC or Mac almost certainly comes with a text 
editor. Notepad is bundled with PCs and can be accessed by choosing Start➪
All Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad. On the Mac, the default editor is 

105
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
TextEdit and can most easily be found by typing textedit into the Spotlight 
search box at the top right and choosing the TextEdit application. I prefer a 
simple text editor to a complicated word processing program like Microsoft 
Word because the word processors sometimes add funny stuff (formatting 
commands, invisible characters, whatever) to the text. With plain text, what 
you see is what you get.
 
If you’re so familiar with Word that you can’t bear the thought of learning 
another program, just save the Word file as .txt instead of .doc in the drop-
down menu in the Save screen. Don’t forget to save the text file somewhere 
you can find it easily — and remember: Word won’t show you files that end in 
extensions other than .doc unless you specifically ask it to.
Step 2: Input the words into the AdTool and generate new ones
Copy the keywords list in your text editor and paste them into the AdTool. 
You can then peel and stick the keywords into individual Excel sheets by ad 
group.
One of the AdTool’s tabs is called Peel & Stick. This phrase entered the 
AdWords landscape courtesy of Perry Marshall, who used it initially to 
describe the process of removing a single keyword from an ad group and 
building a new ad group around that one key keyword. More broadly, peeling 
and sticking refers to tightening ad groups by moving keywords into new ad 
groups — and writing ads that more specifically target those keywords.
The AdTool’s peel and stick function allows you to peel keywords out of your 
giant keyword bucket according to common words or letters.
After you’ve generated all your keywords, go to the Peel & Stick tab. Choose 
a word that’s contained by all the keywords you want to peel out of the big 
group. For example, suppose I peel keywords containing course for the golf 
ad campaign and then e-mail them to myself. I can then stick them straight 
into AdWords, edit them further, or save them for future work. For that 
matter, instead of e-mailing the list, I could copy it to my Clipboard and paste 
it into a text or spreadsheet file.
Step 3: Sort the keywords with Excel
I use Excel to help me view my keywords as sorted by ad group. The first 
sheet is my summary sheet. It includes the names of all my ad groups and 
the search volume for each group. Figure 5-6 shows a very neat division of 
ad groups in the Golf Lesson market, courtesy of Glenn Livingston of www.
ultimateadwordsresearch.com.

106
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Each subsequent sheet shows the keyword list for that ad group, as in 
Figure 5-7.
A spreadsheet laid out this neatly makes it a breeze to input the keywords 
into AdWords. Just select column A by clicking the A at the top of the column, 
copy the entire column, and paste it into the AdWords Add Keywords tool.
 
Figure 5-6:

of the 
spreadsheet 
includes 
every ad 
group with 
a search 
count.
 
 
Go to www.askhowie.com/keywords5 for a video demonstration of using 
Excel for keyword management.
 
Use each keyword only once in your AdWords account. If you include the 
same keyword in two different ad groups, or campaigns, Google will show 
only one ad, based on the keyword’s quality score. Google won’t let you 
compete against yourself by showing both ads. Also, when you have dupli-
cate keywords, your campaign management becomes a mess. You can’t be 
sure how much traffic your keywords are getting because the traffic is 
divided among your ad groups. If you want to delete a nonperforming key-
word, you have to hunt for it in more than one place. So begin your account 
with a clean structure; you’ll find it easy to follow through with best prac-
tices later on.

Deploying Negative Keywords
In the movie The Verdict, Paul Newman plays Frank Galvin, an outgunned 
lawyer representing an injured client in a medical malpractice lawsuit. 
When Galvin realizes that the defendant is hiding incriminating evidence, 
he requests delivery of the damning documents. The defendant delivers the 
evidence in a way that ensures (he hopes) it won’t be found before trial — 
buried somewhere in truckloads of meaningless paper. Your AdWords traffic 
is the same — there are a few gems (your future customers and referrers) 
buried in a giant stream of nonbuyers. Negative keywords are your first line 
of defense, a filtration system that keeps the wrong folks away while letting 
the right folks see your ad.
Let’s say you sell wooden kits for building bat houses. You bid on the key-
words bat and bats and discover that, for some reason, you’re getting large 
numbers of impressions but very low CTRs. What’s going on? Are your ads 
ineffective? Maybe. But the first problem you have to solve is related to key-
words, not ads.
Who else might be searching for bat or bats? Go to www.lexfn.com and 
type bat in the Word 1 search box. Click the Submit Query button, as shown 
in Figure 5-8.

houses for them. The actual search numbers for the top 10 bat-related key-

 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
If you’re bidding on bat as a broad match, you’re going to show your ad 
to a lot of the wrong people. If they don’t click, they don’t cost you money 
directly, but by lowering your CTR, they have a negative impact on your 
quality score. The lower your quality score, the more you need to bid to 
remain in a desirable position. Fortunately, Google provides a solution to 
help you filter out traffic you don’t want: negative keywords.
Negative keywords are words and phrases that automatically disqualify your 
ad from showing should they appear in a search. In the bat house example, 
you’d designate the following negative keywords:
 
✓ baseball
 
✓ softball
 
✓ ball
 
✓ easton
 
✓ milken
You don’t need to include base ball or soft ball because ball already 
takes care of all variations in which ball is a separate word.
Brainstorming negative keywords
You should spend some serious time finding negative keywords. One of the 
most common and costly AdWords mistakes is focusing all your attention 
on positive keywords. Positive keywords bring you traffic, whereas negative 
keywords filter it for you so only the quality searchers ever get to your ad. A 
comprehensive list of negative keywords increases the quality of your traffic 
and improves your CTR significantly. Several sources of negative keywords 
are discussed in the following subsections.
Thinking about who isn’t your customer
No database or tool can replace your own insight and common sense. For 
example, bath house may be a reasonable typo of bat house — you may 
want to include the negative keyword bath. Consider other searches that 
may be triggered by your broad-match keywords. Do you want to show your 
ad to people concerned about bat bites, for example? They may be searching 
for an exterminator or a medical Web site, but perhaps you can entice them 
with an ad like this:
Bat Problems?
Don’t kill them - Help them move!
Bat House Kits - vs. Yard Pests.
www.BatHouseKits.com

110
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
If your best efforts at selling to bite keywords fail, turn bite into a negative 
keyword and move on.
Running the Search Query Report to build your negative keyword list
The Search Query Report (which I discuss more fully in Chapter 14) shows 
you the exact keyword phrases that got searchers to your Web site. If you’re 
bidding on bat problems as broad match, this report will show you that 
one of the visitors to your site triggered that keyword match by typing bat 
problems in the dugout. Aha! You’ve just found another negative keyword — 
dugout — to add to your list.
Searching Google for negative keywords
For example, a Google search on bat brings up the following concepts, all 
unrelated to flying mammals:
 
✓ British American Tobacco (BAT) company
 
✓ The BAT! Email Client
 
✓ Balanced Audio Technology
 
✓ Infogrip BAT Keyboard
 
✓ Brockton Area Transit (BAT) Authority
 
✓ BATch files
Finding negative keywords with the AdWords Keyword Tool
First, go to the ad group you’re working on by logging in to your account and 
choosing the campaign and ad group from the Campaign Summary screen. 
From within that ad group, click the Keywords Tab and select the Keyword 
Tool. Enter your keyword, making sure the Use Synonyms check box is 
selected, and click the Get More Keywords button. (See Figure 5-9.)
In this example, the suggestion tool yields several more negatives:
 
✓ file
 
✓ glove
 
✓ gloves
 
✓ command
What about guano and vampire? Both terms relate to your kind of bat, but 
may bring you high school students looking for articles to rip off for term 
papers (or, for that matter, Twilight or Buffy fans). Can you turn them into 
customers? Perhaps — but you’ll want to keep these traffic streams separate 
from the others so you can send them to the appropriate landing pages (and 
then track your success).

date range. You add negatives to your keyword list by typing a hyphen before 
the word or phrase, as shown in Figure 5-10.
Adding, Deleting, and Editing Keywords
All these keywords won’t do you any good until you place them in your ad 
groups. If you’ve opened up an AdWords account, you have at least one 
keyword in each ad group. Here’s a look at how to add, subtract, edit, and 
manage keywords in the individual ad-group interface.
Log in to your AdWords account and navigate to an individual ad group. Click

 Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords
Growing your keyword list
In your AdWords account, you can add keywords to your ad group in two 
ways:
 
✓ Add Keywords: From within an ad group, select the Keywords tab. 
Add keywords by clicking the Add Keywords button, just above the key-
word list. Google gives you a text box into which you can type or paste 
keywords, one word or phrase per line, as shown in Figure 5-12. You can 
add them straightaway by clicking the Save button, or you can see how 
much traffic Google expects to give you for each of them by clicking the 
Estimate Search Traffic button.
 
 Don’t worry about adding a keyword that you already have in your ad 
group — Google kindly filters out duplicates for you.
 
✓ Keyword Tool: The Keyword Tool, accessible from the Tools tab at the 
top of the page, allows you to type or paste keywords or let Google do it 
for you.
 
 I strongly recommend using Google’s vast keyword capabilities before 
you get to this point. Don’t let Google add words directly into your 
account. Instead, use this tool to generate lots of keywords, and then 
manipulate and filter them in a text file or spreadsheet.

Editing your keywords
Click the Edit Keywords link (next to the Keyword Tool link) to bring up your 
entire list in a text box. Here you can remove, add, and change keywords, as 
well as change your default bid (the amount you’ll pay for a click unless you 
set specific maximum CPCs for individual keywords). Note that negative key-
words do not trigger bids, so you don’t need to worry about bid prices for 
them.
Below the Save Changes button, Google instructs you on changing cost-per-
click bids and destination URLs manually. That’s right — each non-negative 
keyword can have its own bid and its own landing page.
Individual CPC bids
Use Google’s syntax keyword**0.55 to override your default bid for a spe-
cific keyword (see Figure 5-13 for an example). You can accomplish the same 
task much faster, with less possibility of typing or syntax error, through the 
Edit Keywords interface on the main ad group page.
 
Figure 5-13: 
The exact 
match [cold 
calls] now 
has a bid 
of $0.55 
instead of 
the ad group 
default of 
$0.50.
 
To change bids easily and safely, select the keyword or keywords you want to 
re-bid by clicking the check box to the left of each keyword. To select all the 
keywords, select the Keyword check box at the top of the column. Now click 
the Edit Keyword Settings button just above the keyword column to find a 
page like the one shown in Figure 5-14.
Change bids by replacing the number next to the currency sign. Google tells 
you which bids are too low to show on page 1, marking each one with a V icon.

Individual landing pages
You can change destination URLs (landing pages) for each keyword as well. 
Because each keyword represents a slightly different mindset — and buying 
readiness — the perfect AdWords campaign would send each visitor to a 
landing page tailored specifically to his or her keyword. In a perfect world, 
however, you’d have so much money you wouldn’t be reading this book (and 
I’d be playing Ultimate Frisbee instead of writing this book), so don’t get 
carried away by fantasies of unlimited resources. Fact is, you have a certain 
amount of time to spend on AdWords, and no more. Creating individual land-
ing pages for low-traffic keywords isn’t the best way to spend your precious 
AdWords minutes.
At this point, you may be wondering why Google bothers you about differ-
ent landing pages at the same time you set your bids. It’s because the fit 
among your keyword, ad, and landing page helps determine your ad’s Quality 
Score — which determines your minimum CPC for Google and the search 
network. In other words, if your ad isn’t showing on the first page of search 
results, your only option isn’t to raise your bid. You can also improve your 
ad, improve your landing page, and find a better keyword. Raising your bid 
is simply the quickest and least time- and energy-consuming way to get back 
onto the first page.

116
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
In the old days (pre-2004), Google would disable keywords that didn’t achieve 
a minimum 0.5 percent CTR. Now they impose a lazy-tax (in the form of a 
poor Quality Score) on advertisers who show uncompelling ads that invite 
searchers to unhelpful and irrelevant landing pages. So instead of being dis-
abled, your keywords now require exorbitant bids to show on the first page 
of search results. Like a maitre d’ angling for a tip to get you a table at a “full” 
restaurant, Google holds out its palm and says, “You wanna show your ad to 
my people? That’ll be 10 bucks a click.”
In the Edit Keywords tool, you can change the URL after a keyword, like so:
keyword**http://www.yoururl.com/xyz
In Figure 5-15, I’ve added two keywords whose traffic I’m sending to www.
leadsintogold.com/fa, a Web page I set up specifically for financial advi-
sors who work for big houses such as Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley.

T
his sentence contains the same number of characters — 130, including 
spaces — that Google allows you in an ad.
You get four lines of 25, 35, 35, and 35 characters to tell enough of your story 
to compel the right people to choose your ad over all the other ads and 
organic listings on the Google search page. If you’re advertising on the con-
tent network, your ad is competing with articles, videos, games, and more. 
I’ve heard professional copywriters say that the Google ad is the most chal-
lenging form of salesmanship-in-print they’ve ever attempted.
Depressed? Don’t be. Writing effective ads is hard for everyone, not just you. 
Spend some time preparing, practicing, and (especially) testing your ads, and 
you’ll quickly rise to the top of your industry. As business philosopher Jim 
Rohn says, “Don’t wish it were easier — wish you were better.”
This chapter helps you stop wishing and start improving. First, I explain the 
three-pronged goal of your ad. Most advertisers focus on one prong only, to 
their detriment. You discover how to balance the first two goals for maximum 
profits by bringing in the right kind of traffic (not just the maximum possible 
traffic), and how to reach the third goal of setting visitor expectations so your 
prospects are primed for your Web site. Next, you discover how to tune your ad 
to your prospect’s radio station, WII-FM (What’s In It For Me?), based on the key-
word. I share with you the missing link between your ad and your Web site — 
the call to action. I cover some basic strategies for effective ad writing, as well 
as a few top-secret (until now!) “black belt” techniques that you’ll need if you’re 
playing in a hyper-competitive market. Finally, I introduce you to some alterna-
tives to the standard text ad: image, mobile text, local business, and video ads.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Understanding the Three 
Goals of Your Ad
A good ad attracts the right people — your best prospects — to your Web 
site. Your ad has three goals:
 
✓ Generating clicks from qualified visitors
 
✓ Discouraging the people who are unlikely to become your customers 
from clicking your ad
 
✓ Setting your prospects’ expectations so that your Web site satisfies (and 
possibly even delights) them
The following sections discuss these three goals in detail.
Attracting the right prospects while 
discouraging the wrong people
The AdWords medium encourages a stepladder approach. The job of the ad 
is to deliver drooling prospects to your Web site. They don’t even have to be 
drooling over what you want to sell them, just over what you’re offering them 
in the ad. Sometimes the ad offer and the first sale are identical — selling a 
product they’re searching for by name and model. Other times, you’re dan-
gling a magnet that will attract the quarters and ignore the wooden nickel. (I 
talk more about lead-generating magnets in Chapter 10.)
Your four-line ad can’t make a sale, any more than a door-to-door salesperson 
can ring the doorbell, utter one sentence, and sell a $1,000 vacuum cleaner. 
The first sentence is meant to make the prospect listen to the second sentence. 
Likewise, the Google ad isn’t long enough to capture the prospects’ attention, 
pique their interest, stroke their desire, and make them pull out their credit 
card. Let your Web site, e-mails, and phone calls accomplish the heavy lifting. 
Craft your ad to make or imply a promise that your landing page can keep.
 
The rest of this chapter shows you how to write an attractive ad. Right now, 
though, I’m going to tell you how to make your ad unattractive. After all, a 
click means you just paid Google. Clicks from the wrong people can cost you a 
lot of money without putting any of it back in your pocket.
You may remember magazine ads that featured a huge red headline of the 
word sex, with the subhead, “Now that I’ve got your attention . . .” The ad 
would go on to sell some product totally unrelated to the headline. Similarly, 

119
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
many people use names of celebrities (Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, for 
example) in their ads to grab attention. Don’t try that with AdWords. In 
cyberspace, folks are serious about their searches. If they feel misled by your 
ad, they’ll cost you a click and never visit you again. For example:
Free Britney Spears Pics
Hundreds of exclusive photos
and videos - all completely free!
www.BootzRus.com/BritneyGoesWild
If your site actually sells custom inserts for cowboy boots, this ad will almost 
certainly achieve a higher CTR (click through rate) than the more traditional 
ad that follows:
Custom Cowboy Boot Inserts
Instant relief of bunions and corns
Cures athlete’s foot - free shipping.
www.BootzRus.com/CowboyBootInserts
But how qualified is the traffic from the first ad? Aside from their anger at 
being duped when they arrive at a site featuring cowboys with corns and not 
the celebrity gossip or racy pictures they expected, how likely would they 
have been to want boot inserts in the first place?
The Britney mistake doesn’t usually look that stark and ridiculous, but I see 
it all the time in my clients’ campaigns. Big promises are great, but when 
they’re too vague, they attract the wrong people. For example, NovaMind.
com sells mind mapping software to help writers and others brainstorm cre-
atively and efficiently. Here’s an ad I made up that would probably beat all 
their other ads’ CTRs, but wouldn’t lead to many sales:
Be More Creative
Amazing Technique Helps You
Brainstorm Brilliant Ideas
www.NovaMind.com
This ad promises a big benefit — one that the software theoretically can 
deliver on — but doesn’t qualify the benefit with any information that would 
allow someone to say, “Oh, that’s not for me.”
Here’s one of their real ads:
Mind Map Software

Mind. Download a Free Trial now!

120
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
The headline states what the product is and by implication disqualifies 
people who don’t own, like, or use computers. The free trial offer is appeal-
ing, but suggests that the product itself isn’t free. Free is a powerful word and 
must be used cautiously in AdWords. People who have no desire to pay for 
something will still take one if it’s free. If the ad had promised a free down-
load without qualifying it as a trial, they would have increased CTR at the 
expense of the traffic quality.
Writing a personals ad
Think of your ad like a personals ad. If you’re putting personals ads in local 
papers or Match.com, your goal isn’t to attract every bozo in the county. 
Instead, you want to weed out the incompatibles and make every date a 
potential winner. Personals ads achieve this qualification by stating who 
should not apply:
Divorced White Male, 53, in good health, seeks Single White Female, non-
smoker, under 45; no cats or whistling cockroaches; must not be allergic to 
peanuts or mangos; must like Berlioz, Bartok, and organic kohlrabi.
Negative qualifiers not only weed out the wrong folks; they also attract the 
right folks: (“He’s right — I could never live with a whistling cockroach. We’re 
a lot alike. I wonder what he looks like. . . .”)
Your ad can qualify based on location (Roslindale IT Consultant), price 
(Downloadable Book — $17.77), limited options (Red and Gold Only), plat-
form (Not Mac-Compatible), profession (For Teachers), personality (No 
Whiners!), and many other characteristics. Brainstorm a list of qualifiers by 
answering the question, “Who shouldn’t buy from me?” If you sell a stand-
alone version and a prospect is searching for an enterprise edition, don’t 
even waste a nickel of your cash or a minute of their time. If your negative 
keywords didn’t turn them away (see Chapter 5), let your ad do it before they 
cost you money.
Which side do you want to err on?
Every ad has to choose between Mistake #1 and Mistake #2. Mistake #1 is the 
false positive: Someone clicks who isn’t your customer. You’ve just wasted 
the click price. Mistake #2 is the false negative: You send away someone who 
would have bought from you.
Which mistake is worse depends on how much each mistake costs you and 
how often it occurs. If your clicks cost 5 cents and your average sale is $800, 
you can afford a lot of false positives (800 × 20 = 16,000 to be exact) for each 
sale. On the other hand, if clicks cost $32 each, your campaign will hemor-
rhage cash if you aren’t very particular about whom, exactly, you invite to 
your site.

121
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
 
Ultimately, the decision to widen or narrow the ad comes down to the value of 
a visitor from that ad to your Web site. One ad will simply make you more 
money (after subtracting your advertising spend) than all the others. Your 
mission is to keep writing ads until you find that one.
Telling your visitors what to expect
The third goal of your ad is to manage expectations. If your ad conveys 
playfulness, don’t send your visitor to a dry and hyper-professional-looking 
landing page. If you advertise a free download, make it easy to find that 
download. If you highlight a benefit, focus the landing page on that benefit. 
Show your prospect that you keep your promises, even the little ones you 
make in your ads. Think of the ad as the headline of your landing page — 
make sure it signals the precise benefit someone will get when she clicks 
through to your site.
Tuning Your Ad to the Keyword
Imagine that your goal is to sell a photocopier to Al Schmendrick, a local 
business owner. Which ad headline has the best chance of success?
 
A. Big Sale on Business Machines This Week
 
B. Are You Tired of Clearing Paper Jams from Your Old Copier?
 
C. Hey, Al Schmendrick: Are You Tired of Clearing Paper Jams from Your 
Old Copier?
If my kids’ college tuition depended on the sale, I’d choose headline C in 
a heartbeat. Why? It’s all about the prospect, and it’s very likely to get his 
attention. In fact, if Al Schmendrick doesn’t read the paper that day or skips 
the page that contains my ad, I’d bet that one of Al’s friends will tell him 
about it.
The meta-message of your ad to your best prospect is, “This ad is all about 
you.” Marketing consultant Dan Kennedy talks about the message-to-market 
match. The keyword defines the market — who they are and what they want. 
Your ad is the message that must address their self-identity and desires. As I 
talk about in Chapter 5, the tighter your ad groups, the more precisely your 
tone, message, and offer can match what each market will respond to.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Marching to a Different Drummer
AdWords is arguably the most competitive advertising real estate on earth. 
Where else can you find dozens of competitors crammed sardine-like into the 
same space, vying for eyeballs and actions? If you said “the Yellow Pages,” 
you’re almost right. AdWords functions like the Yellow Pages, except in four 
important respects that make AdWords far more competitive:
 
✓ In the Yellow Pages, customers might find your ad on the third page of 
listings, but it could be the very first ad they see. Position is less impor-
tant than size and look. An AdWords ad on page 8 is essentially invisible.
 
✓ The Yellow Pages separates the free and paid listings into white and 
yellow pages. Google shows both on the same page. I’ve heard from 
AdWords clients who also have first-page organic rankings who tell me 
that their organic listing generates three times as many clicks as their ad.
 
✓ Because AdWords is a results-accountable medium (meaning, you can tell 
when your ad works and when it doesn’t), many AdWords competitors 
have become proficient through trial and error. Most Yellow Pages ads 
are just plain awful because businesses haven’t discovered the direct-
marketing principles that allow for continuous improvement. (For more 
on this, visit my Web site www.leadsintogold.com.)
 
✓ In the Yellow Pages, you don’t pay less or move to a better position if 
your ad is more effective than a competitor’s. The Yellow Pages is like 
golf: Your score doesn’t directly affect your competitor’s score. AdWords 
rewards relevance with lower prices and higher position, making it more 
like tennis.
 
The most important rule when trying to stand out in a crowd is, “When they 
zig, you zag.” As you compose your ad, keep your prospect’s big question in 
mind: “Why should I click your ad instead of all the other ads and organic list-
ings on this page, instead of typing a different search term — and instead of 
blowing off this search entirely and logging on to Facebook for three hours?”
Studying your competition
Search for your top 5–10 keywords and print the results pages. Study these 
sheets — they may represent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of 
dollars of market research and testing. Get a notebook and jot down your 
observations about each of the ads:
 
✓ What’s the big promise?
 
✓ What’s the tone?
 
✓ What’s the emotional appeal?

123
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
 
✓ What’s the logical appeal?
 
✓ How does each ad position itself as different from the rest?
 
✓ What features are highlighted?
 
✓ What proof is offered?
 
✓ What is the call to action?
Positioning your offer
Different isn’t enough — your ad must be better. Your goal is to write an ad 
that sets you apart from the other ads in a way that connects you with your 
market. For example, say you sell industrial fans. You check out the AdWords 
competition and discover that the keyword industrial fan brings up ads 
that focus on models, features, and price. You can differentiate your company 
by writing an ad citing benefits and ROI.
You can position your offer as unique in many ways. Your market research 
(detailed in Chapter 4) can give you ideas about what your market wants and 
what the competition is currently providing and talking about. Now you can 
write ads that address unmet needs.
When most businesspeople think of competition, they think first of price. If 
you can produce your goods and services more efficiently than others, you 
can compete on price. After all, Wal-Mart does it. But being the cheapest isn’t 
usually the most compelling sales argument. Do you want the cheapest floor-
ing in your living room? Do you want to drive the cheapest car? Do you want 
the cheapest heart surgeon operating on you? Besides, price wars often end 
up as a damaging race to the bottom for all involved, including the customer 
who finds that the business can’t deliver quality at the price quoted.
If a segment of your market is searching for a particular model, like the 
Lifeline USA Power Wheel or the Canon PowerShot SX10IS, they may have 
decided on that particular model already and are now comparison-shopping 
for the best deal. In that case, an ad that mentions price can be effective.
Two fundamental ways to position your ad
One way to position your ad is to slice the niche differently.
For example, if you sell martial arts training videos, books, and equipment, 
you might assume that the entire world of martial arts students and enthu-
siasts is your market. If you claim a slice of that market and speak to them 
specifically — for example, college-age women, senior citizens, bouncers — 

124
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
you can position yourself as their supplier of choice. Each of those niches 
might be small, but you can own them all if they self-identify with their 
keywords.
The second way to position your ad is to make a better first offer.
Even though the goal of the ad is to make a first sale, you can offer other 
things that your prospects may want or need before they buy. Reviews, free 
samples (physical, informational, or software), advice, video demonstration, 
discussion, and so on can be dangled in front of prospects who haven’t yet 
made up their minds. As long as the “magnet” attracts your prospects and 
leaves nonprospects cold, you can generate the right clicks by offering an 
intermediate step of value.
No matter what you sell, you can always position yourself as an expert in 
the field. Search, by definition, implies some gap between your customers’ 
desires and the information they have about how to fulfill those desires. If 
your ad offers to guide and educate, rather than simply to sell, your offer can 
stand out.
Motivating Action in Four Lines
Everyone makes decisions rationally, right? People weigh the pros and cons, 
consider their values and priorities, and maximize benefits while minimizing 
costs. People balance risks and rewards, and get better over time as they 
learn from their experiences.
That doesn’t sound like anybody I know.
The truth is, all people make decisions emotionally, in their guts. They justify 
those decisions using logic, but the part of the brain that can handle matrices 
and cost-benefit analyses is just slower than the part that acts out of fear 
and greed. Before they consciously ponder, that old reptile brain decides 
instantly whether someone is friend or foe, prey or predator.
The AdWords ad heightens the emotional aspect of decision making because 
the rational brain has very little to go on: three lines of text and a Web 
address. Marketing consultant David Bullock, of www.davidbullock.com, 
puts it this way:
How do you connect to the “right” click?
One second is all that you have to get the attention of your online visitor. 
That’s it.
The fastest way to meet your revenue goal is to figure out what to say, write, 
or display in this little 1-inch space to get, hold, and motivate the viewer to 
click your AdWords ad.

125
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
Simply, the idea is to develop a stunning emotional appeal that gets the 
“right” click.
By definition, emotional appeal is the mental state that arises spontaneously 
rather than through conscious effort and is often accompanied by 
physiological changes; a feeling: the emotions of joy, sorrow, reverence, 
hate, and love.
As you boil it down, most of the decisions people make are based on fear 
and desire. All emotional states arise from one of these two states. We are 
either moving toward something or away from some situation.
Your ad has to hit the visitor/searcher right between the eyes, make an 
instantaneous connection and move the visitor to spontaneously gravitate 
towards your offer. It is not a matter of logic. Your visitor has no time to 
think about not clicking your AdWords ad. Your goal is to get them to your 
landing page and move forward in your customer-acquisition process.
Either you hit the mark or you are off. You either get the click or you don’t. 
Period. End of story.
Your four lines must focus on emotions first and logic second. Your prospect 
will use logic to construct a search strategy (choosing keywords, searching 
for information, refining the search to longer and most specific keywords, 
and so on), but moves toward and away from search results and Web sites 
based on a subconscious emotional response.
To write effective ads, you have to understand the conversation that just 
took place inside the head of your prospect as he typed the keyword that 
brought him ad to them. What is his story? What is he telling himself about 
his situation and how to improve it?
And I mean story quite literally. Go check out a book of fairy tales, or rent a 
couple of Disney movies to remind yourself what a story contains: a hero 
(that’s them), a problem, a trigger to action, obstacles and villains, and a 
happy ending. If your ad can connect to the right place in their story, you can 
grab their attention and lead them the rest of the way.
Figure 6-1 shows the top ten ads for the keyword home based business. 
Which ads plug into compelling stories?
Home-based business offers tap into the business opportunity market, which 
is actually several different markets, each with its own set of motivations and 
internal stories. Examine the first four ads to identify what they’re up to:
 
✓ Home Business: A no-nonsense ad that uses words like legitimate and 
serious to emphasize the soberness of this opportunity. The syntax 
implies that the entrepreneur in question is already doing this, making 
it by definition do-able. The ad connects with the prospect whose story 
is, “I don’t believe in something for nothing. If I want to be successful, I 
have to be willing to work for it. (But not too hard, I hope.)”

126
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
 
✓ I Was Scammed 37 Times: This ad allows the reader to bond with Danny 
over his misfortunes, and to feel superior to him even as they take his 
advice. The word scammed appears three times, tying into the cynicism 
of the serial opportunity seeker who too has felt scammed yet keeps 
hoping that the perfect business opportunity is just around the corner. 
The word absolute is a powerful emotional trigger, making the tone one 
of righteous indignation. Prospects who subconsciously want a protec-
tor will be drawn to this ad.
 
✓ Home Based Business — Free: The emotionally laden phrase in this ad 
is, “You won’t get rich.” The word realistic and the modest income claims 
support the notion that this opportunity, unlike others, is achievably 
modest. It’s designed to give hope to those who have been burned or 
turned off by big promises. This ad connects with the story, “If some-
thing’s too good to be true, it probably is.” The URL reflects the theme 
of realistic expectations by calling it a project and promising a payday 
rather than a windfall.
 
✓ Don’t Lose $49 Bucks: This ad is similar to the second one, but speaks 
directly to the prospect’s fear of loss by concretizing and quantifying the 
risk. Even without knowing how they might lose this $49, the prospect 
for this ad is suspicious enough to want to find out. The ad appeals to 
“cautious risk-takers” who believe that having inside information can 
make them safe. Their story goes like this: “The world is a dangerous 
place for suckers, but I will be rewarded for my educated boldness.”
 
Figure 6-1: 
Each ad 
addresses 
a different 
story the 
searcher 
may be 
narrating 
to her- or 
himself.
 
The two ads at the bottom of the right column (Home Income Opportunity 
and Your Passport to Wealth?) are interesting because of their choices of 
emotionally laden words. CEO implies power and status, and speaks to a 

127
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
frustrated employee of a large company who envies and probably resents the 
CEO. The word passport attracts prospects who view exotic travel as market 
of success. They crave movement and excitement over security.
An old marketing acronym, AIDA, names the four states that have to occur, in 
order, in your prospect before you can make a sale:
 
✓ Attention: Attention is compelled by a headline that names the pros-
pects or their pain, or connects with one of the big three motivators: 
greed, fear, or curiosity.
 
✓ Interest: Interest is raised by naming features and benefits (price, free 
shipping, options, works in zero gravity, you know the drill).
 
✓ Desire: The desire is the happy ending, or a promised step in that direc-
tion. (They can’t slay the dragon until they find the enchanted sword.)
 
✓ Action: The action is the click, to go from the Google results page to 
your landing page.
All this highfalutin’ theory is great, but time to get down to business. You 
have four lines to accomplish these marketing tasks. The following sections 
break down the task of each line so you can begin to create magnetic ads.
Grabbing them with the headline
The goal of the headline is to get your prospects’ attention while leaving 
everyone else unimpressed. Classic headline gambits include the following:
 
✓ Name Them:
 
• Considering a Unicycle
 
• Mind Maps for Teachers
 
• Actor’s Disability Insur.
 
✓ Mirror Their Itch:
 
• Suffering from Gout?
 
• Rotten-Egg Water Odors?
 
• Disorganized?
 
✓ Pick Their Scab with a Provocative Question:
 
• Suffering IBS for Years?
 
• Do You Hate Filing?
 
• Got a Jerk for a Boss?

128
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
 
✓ Arouse Curiosity:
 
• Are You Right-Brained?
 
• Are You a Slacker Mom?
 
• Copywriting Secret #19
 
✓ Warn Them:
 
• I was scammed 37 times
 
• Howie Jacobson Exposed
 
• Biodiesel Scandal
 
✓ Make a Big Promise:
 
• Write and Publish a Book
 
• The “Beat Gout” Diet
 
• Jump Higher in 14 Days
 
✓ Offer Unbiased Information:
 
• 8 Shower Filters Tested
 
• Flat-Panel TV Reviews
 
• Compare Autoresponders
Use the keyword if appropriate
If you include the keyword in your headline, you can almost always increase 
your ad CTR. For example, an ad with the headline “Homebrew for Beginners” 
achieved a 3.88 percent CTR for the keyword [homebrew] but pulled only 
1.01 percent for [home brew].
Matching the ad to the exact keyword tells your prospects that you under-
stand them (even if you don’t). NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) experts 
tell you that people build rapport by using the same words as others rather 
than paraphrasing. Also, Google bolds keywords on its results page. If you 
search for healthy recipe, you’ll see several advertisers who take advan-
tage of this fact, whereas others offer healthy recipes and don’t get the 
benefit of bolding.
If your competitors are all using the keywords in their headlines (or, in the 
case of keywords of 20–25 characters, as their headlines), you’ll want to 
choose a different strategy to stand out. But it’s a rare ad that won’t benefit 
from inclusion of keywords somewhere in the headline, description, or URL.
Develop a swipe file
A swipe file is a collection of successful advertising pieces from which you 
can draw inspiration. Professional copywriters rarely invent headlines and 
bullets from thin air; instead, they modify old standards. For example, John 

129
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
Caples famously (among direct marketing geeks, anyway) sold a piano home 
study course with the headline, “They laughed when I sat down at the piano 
but when I started to play . . . !” Today, copywriters model this formula in 
selling everything from baking magazines (“They laughed when I got up to 
bake”) to dog training (“They laughed when I issued my $10,000 dog-trainer 
challenge . . .”).
Perry Marshall recommends building your own AdWords swipe file quickly 
and inexpensively by visiting your local library or supermarket and copying 
the text on the covers of popular magazines. If you prefer to stay at home, 
go to www.magazines.com to view covers of current issues. Here are some 
headline formulas from this week’s issues of Cosmo, O, Woman’s Day, and 
Vogue, followed in parentheses by possible AdWords adaptations:
 
✓ 19 dresses that show who’s boss (7 skateboards that show who’s boss)
 
✓ The season’s hottest styles (The season’s hottest cameras)
 
✓ Weird male behavior decoded (Weird dog behavior decoded)
 
✓ Break your bad food habits (Break your bad skiing habits)
 
✓ Shhh! We’ve got a big secret to less stress (Shh! A big packaging secret)
Using the description lines to make 
them an offer they can’t refuse
AdWords consultant Joy Milkowski (getmoreaccess) has put together a 
menu of ad elements you can deploy in your two description lines. She rec-
ommends choosing two, plus a call to action. (See the “Sending Out a Call to 
Action” section for more information.)
Take some time and brainstorm a few elements for your ad for each of the fol-
lowing menu items. Don’t worry yet about fitting your copy into the AdWords 
space restrictions. Just get the concepts first and whittle away the extra 
words later.
Your menu of ad elements
I’m going to find examples of Joy’s ad elements in phrases from real ads for a 
single keyword: data recovery.
 
✓ Address a Pain Point: If your customers are searching because they 
want to prevent or alleviate a problem, you can stoke their interest and 
build rapport by showing them you understand their situation.
 
• Lost data?
 
• No Need to Panic

130
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
 
✓ Offer a Solution: It’s a marketing cliché that people buy holes, not drills, 
yet businesses routinely neglect to advertise the solutions they provide. 
One way to get at the solution your customers want is to fill in the 
blanks, “We provide _________ to ___________ and what this means to 
you is _______________.” What you wrote in the last blank is the solution. 
The solutions listed as follows are tame. I would enliven them by adding a 
“what this means to you” phrase (in parentheses following each solution).
 
• Restore Lost or Deleted Data (so you can keep billing your 
customers)
 
• Fast data recovery for SQL Server (so you can keep your business 
running)
 
✓ List Features: If your product or service is significantly different from 
your competitors’ offerings, list the differentiating features. Banks that 
are open on Sunday and late on weekdays, environmentally friendly dry 
cleaners, and single-volume print-on-demand presses are all examples of 
companies seeking an advantage by doing things a little differently.
 
• HD, RAID, Tape, CD/DVD, Memory Card
 
• 24/7 Support
 
• On-Site Clean Room
 
✓ Short Value Proposition: A value proposition is the answer to the ques-
tion, “What do you do that makes you the best choice for me?” The first 
example is a no-quibble guarantee, whereas the second sets out a spe-
cific performance goal.
 
• No Data, No Cost
 
• We Recover Most Data in 24 Hours
 
✓ Differentiator: You can compare your business favorably to others, 
either overtly or by implication. Google generally frowns upon superla-
tives (best, cheapest, biggest), but usually is okay with qualifiers such 
as better, cheaper, bigger. Two of the following examples trash the com-
petition by implication: “We actually do it” implies that others don’t, 
whereas “no junk fees” suggests that competitors tack on extra charges 
to pad their margins.
 
• Others say $379, we actually do it!
 
• Fastest Turnaround Time
 
• No Junk Fees
 
✓ Price: In a price-sensitive market, you can signal that you’re the best deal 
by naming a specific price, by telling your prospect that you have low 
prices, or by offering free shipping. For some reason, free shipping is a 
very popular online feature. People will pay $20 for the product if they can 
avoid a $7.95 shipping fee (not consciously, but it happens all the time).

131
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
 
• $379
 
• Low Flat Rates

Benefits before features
No one formula for effective ad writing exists, and you have to make sure the 
elements you combine make sense together and all pull in the same direction. 
In general, though, you won’t go wrong by putting the big benefit on the first 
line and the differentiating feature on the second line. The second line will 
also contain the other crucial element of your ad: the call to action.
Sending Out a Call to Action
You usually want your prospects to click your ad. (In some cases, you may 
prefer that they phone; if so, include your phone number in the ad. Several 
of the data-recovery ads had phone numbers, probably on the assumption 
that someone typing data recovery is in a state of near-hysteria and 
wants to contact a real person ASAP.) Joy Milkowski suggests two tactics to 
compel the click: Offer something in exchange for action and create a sense 
of urgency.

132
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Making an offer with action words
When you offer something, use action words. Your prospect is searching with 
a “gatherer” mentality. Offer something bright and shiny to shift them into 
“hunter” mode. Active action words include
 
✓ Get, buy, or purchase
 
✓ Order, call, or sign up
 
✓ Try or download
More passive action words help the prospect make a decision:
 
✓ See, learn, compare, or discover
 
✓ View, listen, or watch
The following examples are from ads that appeared when I searched for the 
keyword data recovery. Note how they all begin with action words.
 
✓ Get a Quote Today
 
✓ Call 1-800-555-1212 for Free Analysis
 
✓ Discover reliable data recovery.
 
✓ View demo — whitepaper
Fanning desire with urgency qualifiers
Nothing stokes desire as much as unattainability. If you can’t have it, you 
want it all the more. Joy uses urgency words to compel immediate action:
 
✓ Now
 
✓ Today
 
✓ By (date)
 
✓ While it lasts (in conjunction with a sale price)
Mastering the Medium and 
Voice at Haiku U.
Once you’ve chosen your approach and selected elements that will compel 
action from the right prospects, you have to fit that content elegantly into 
135 characters. Joy Milkowski calls this step, “Sell to me in ten words or less.” 

133
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
Stop thinking sales pitch and start thinking haiku — the Japanese poetic art 
that paints a compelling mental picture in 17 syllables.
First, forget everything your high-school English teachers taught you about 
grammar. Your ad must read like a conversation, not an essay. Notice that Joy 
didn’t use the more grammatically correct construction, “Sell to me in ten 
words or fewer.” Write like you talk — or better yet, write like your market 
talks.
Apple Computer is running very effective ads featuring two actors portray-
ing a Mac and a PC. The Mac actor is a hip young dude, whereas the PC actor 
is a pocket-protector–wearing nerd who awkwardly stumbles and bumbles 
through life. If huge multinational companies develop personalities in the 
minds of consumers, your business too needs a voice. Your ads are the first 
words in this voice that your prospects will hear.
The best business personalities are slightly exaggerated but basically accu-
rate extensions of the business owner or leader. Start adopting that voice 
in your ads. An Internet marketer calling himself “The Rich Jerk” used the 
following ad when the name of another Internet marketer (whose name I’ve 
omitted) was typed as a keyword:
I’m Rich. You’re Not.
How much money did [name] make?
Who cares? I make millions.
therichjerk.com
This ad works both to attract a certain type of person and to strongly repel 
everyone else. In some markets (like Internet marketing, for example), your 
tone can be brash. In others, you must come across as professional and no-
nonsense. You can be caring, efficient, funny, angry, matter-of-fact, exasper-
ated, excited, clinical, or poetic. Test different voices to find out which one 
connects best with your market. But your best voice will most often be your 
genuine voice — just smoothed and amped a bit to cut through the clutter of 
Timid Timmies and Me-Too Mollies. Your prospects are looking for authentic-
ity in a world full of fakeness. Connect to them as your unique self and you’re 
already cutting through the clutter.
Almost everything about your business can be copied, except for you. No one 
else has your thoughts, your experiences, your unique point of view. Most 
businesspeople hide this aspect of themselves to appear professional. It’s 
possible to do both — be real and be professional. Take advantage of your 
only true differentiator and be yourself whenever possible.
 
AdWords consultant Garrett Todd of www.impresscallers.com cautions 
against rampant creativity. Extensive testing has shown him that classic 
direct-marketing approaches outperform offbeat, creative ads. He shared his 
top two formulas with me:

134

✓ Who Else Wants to . . .
Music On Hold
Who Else Wants to Reduce Hang-Ups
and Impress On-Hold Callers?
www.Impress-Callers.com
 
✓ If . . . Then . . .
Music On Hold
If You Want to Reduce Hang-Ups

www.Impress-Callers.com
Garrett reports that the first ad generates an impressive 11.02 percent CTR. 
Note that his display URL includes a hyphen; he found that separating the 
two words increased CTR. The www prefix also improved CTR.
Rob Goyette of www.howtomarketbetter.com, another crackerjack 
AdWords user, found that his most successful problem headline was
Got [problem]?
For example:
Got Gout?
Naming Your Online Store Effectively
Many advertisers spend dozens of hours brainstorming and agonizing over 
their headline and two description lines, and never play with their URLs. 
That’s a big mistake; your URL makes up 25 percent of your entire ad and is 
often the most important line. Your URL is the name of your store; it conveys 
lots of meta-information about who you are and whom you serve.
For example, I used to funnel some cold calling traffic to Free-Lead-
Generation-Course.com, which offered a 7-day e-mail course instead of 
a sales-letter Web site. My CTR was comparable to ads that sent traffic to 
LeadsintoGold.com, but the free course generated about half as many 
sales.
Buying more domain names
Even if you have one main Web site, you can buy other URLs and use them in 
your ads. Domain names cost about $8.00 a year these days (I use www.get
goingonline.com).

135
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
Glenn Livingston offers the examples shown in Figure 6-2 of huge differences 
in CTR due solely to changes in the display URL.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Different 
display 
URLs can 
double CTR.
 
The domain suffixes also tell a story. The business-focused .com some-
times can be beaten by the nonprofit .org, and even .org domains 
can in fact front for-profit businesses. If you offer reviews or com-
parisons, TheAntiWrinkleInstitute.org may pull better than 
JanesWrinkleBustingCream.com.
Google doesn’t allow you to use more than one domain name per ad group 
and insists that the domain in the display URL be the same as the domain 
of the actual landing page, so you can’t split-test display URLs to the same 
extent as the other three visible lines of your ad.
You can use Glenn’s clever method of testing URLs as headlines. Say you’re 
curious about which URL will produce better results: RealDogLovers.com or 
HelpSavetheDogs.com. Test those URLs as headlines: Real Dog Lovers 
versus Help Save the Dogs. After you have a winner, buy that domain name 
and use it as the display URL and the domain of your landing page.
Adding subdomains and subdirectories
Joy Milkowski improved her die-cutting client’s CTR by changing the display 
URL from www.MyClient.com to www.MyClient.com/die-cut. (Her client’s 
URL wasn’t actually myclient.com — most successful AdWords advertisers 
view their ads and keywords as maps to secret fishing holes, kept close to the 
chest and never shared with potential competitors. And with AdWords’ low 
barrier to entry, pretty much everyone is your potential competitor.)
 
In the preceding example, /die-cut is a subdirectory, or folder, within the 
Web site. You can also test subdomains, which look like this:
die-cut.myclient.com

136
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
If you’re not sure how to create subdomains or subdirectories, ask your 
Webmaster.
Testing capitalization and the www prefix
Check out the two ads shown in Figure 6-3. The top ad received 4.64 percent 
CTR, compared to only 2.22 percent CTR for the second ad. The only differ-
ence was the URL.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Two ads 
with differ-
ent CTRs.
 
The top ad included the www and capitalized the first letter of each keyword — 
and attracted more than twice as many clicks per impression as the lower ad.
Wielding “Black Belt” Techniques 
for Hyper-Competitive Markets
I know you bought this book to figure out the basics of AdWords, to get into 
the game. But if your market is highly competitive, you have to start at the 
Big Leagues level just to get any impressions on your keywords. If your 
keywords are expensive, you may need one of more of the following three 
techniques just to stay solvent while you crack the AdWords code:
 
✓ The “fake” www domain is easy enough to try, as long as someone else 
in your market hasn’t thought of it already. (Hey, here’s an idea: Buy up 
every copy of this book you can find, just to make sure your competition 
doesn’t know this technique.)
 
✓ Dynamic keyword insertion is almost a Google secret. For good 
reason — do it wrong and you’re looking at an AdWords bill that could 
fund a flight to Mars. So read carefully — and don’t even consider 
using it until you’ve installed and mastered conversion tracking and 
analytics on your Web site.
 
✓ Subdomain redirects were pioneered by Perry Marshall, who has many 
happy clients using it for all their domains. It’s a way to test hundreds of 
URLs without having to buy them. This technique is a little complicated, 
but worth it in many cases.

137
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
The fake www-domain technique
You may have noticed the trick that Glenn Livingston of www.ultimate
adwordsresearch.com used in creating his winning display URLs earlier 
in this chapter. He added www- to a popular keyword and showed that to 
searchers.
This technique works because it tricks the eye into seeing your domain as 
the main Web site in the category. Someone searching for digital cameras 
will view www.DigitalCameras.com as the most relevant and authoritative 
domain to visit. Glenn bought the domain http://www.www-digital
cameras.com and simply omitted the “real” www from the display URL. The 
searcher sees www-DigitalCameras.com and can easily confuse it for www.
DigitalCameras.com.
This technique is a cheap trick, but it’s possibly worth the price of several 
cases of this book.
Dynamic keyword insertion
Do you ever wonder how eBay and Amazon manage to bid on practically 
every keyword in existence and show those keywords in their ads? They 
don’t have thousands of employees creating millions of different ads. Instead, 
they use a special format to stick the keyword right into a generic ad, as 
shown in Figure 6-4. And now you can do it too!
 
Figure 6-4: 
These ads 
dynamically 
insert the 
keyword.
 
To use dynamic keyword insertion, first make friends with the squiggly 
brackets. On most keyboards, you can find them by using the Shift key with 
the square bracket keys, just below the - and = keys near the top right. They 
look like this:
{ left squiggly bracket
} right squiggly bracket

138
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Dynamic keyword insertion requires two decisions:
 
✓ How you want to handle capitalization of keywords?
 
✓ What do you want to appear on-screen in case the keyword is too long to 
fit into the ad?
Say you sell mobile phone ringtones and you know lots of people are search-
ing by typing their favorite performer, composer, or type of music followed 
by ringtone. The list of potential keywords could be enormous. Without 
dynamic keywords insertion, you’d either spend hundreds of hours creat-
ing tightly focused ad groups (see Chapter 5), like Mozart ringtone, 
Beethoven ringtone, Bach ringtone, Beyonce ringtone, and so on 
or you’d have a few big ad groups with thousands of those keywords and 
very vague ads with headlines like these:
 
✓ Classical Music Ringtones
 
✓ R&B Ringtones
 
✓ Hip-Hop Ringtones
To use dynamic keyword insertion, create medium-sized ad group buckets:
 
✓ Classical Music
 
✓ Pop Music
 
✓ Country Music
 
✓ Rap Music
and so on. Put all your classical music terms — Beethoven, Hilary Hahn, 
violin concerto, Leonard Bernstein, Philharmonic — in the 
Classical Music ad group. Then create the following headline:
{KeyWord:Classical Music Ringtones}
 
Note that the colon is not followed by a space!
Now if someone searches for one of your keywords, she’ll see that keyword in 
the headline if it contains 25 characters or fewer:
 
✓ Hilary Hahn Ringtones
 
✓ Bach Requiem Ringtone
 
✓ Missa Solemnis ring tone

139
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
If the keyword is too long (Alicia de Larrocha Mozart piano sonata 
in C ringtone), she’ll see the default keyword Classical Music 
Ringtones instead.
To capitalize every word of the keyword, capitalize the K and W in KeyWord:
{KeyWord:Alternate Text}
Capitalize just the first word by capitalizing the K only:
{Keyword:Alternate Text}
If you want the keyword to appear in all lowercase, don’t capitalize any letters:
{keyword:Alternate Text}
If her keyword doesn’t fit, the alternate text will appear exactly as you’ve 
typed it — capitalized or not.
 
If you’re careless about your keyword list, you could end up spending a lot of 
money that you won’t make back. An extreme example to make the point: Say 
my friend Battery Bob accidentally includes Paris Hilton in the keyword 
list for his cell phone battery ad group.
Without dynamic keyword insertion, the worst that happens is a million teen-
agers looking for gossip or racy photos see and ignore the following ad:
Cell Phone Batteries
All Makes and Models
Low Prices - Same Day Shipping
www.BatteryBob.com
But with dynamic keyword insertion, here’s what they might see:
Paris Hilton Videos
All Makes and Models
Low Prices - Same Day Shipping
www.BatteryBob.com
Uh-oh, Battery Bob. You just spent $12,000 on clicks in about six hours, with 
no sales to show for it. (The real Battery Bob would never make such a mis-
take, of course.)
 
You can deploy dynamic keyword insertion not only in the headline and 
description lines, but also in the display URL for marketing purposes and the 
destination URL for advanced conversion tracking.

140
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Subdomain redirects
The third “black belt” ad technique gives you a chance to test hundreds of 
display URLs for the price of one. A subdomain is the part of your URL that 
can appear before the main domain name. For example, books is the 
subdomain of this Web site:
http://books.fitfam.com
With a Web service called www.zoneedit.com, you can quickly and easily 
create new subdomains without needing to know Web design, HTML, server 
architecture, or how to make vegan oatmeal cookies. (I actually do know how 
to make delicious vegan oatmeal cookies — send a blank e-mail to cookies@
fitfam.com for the recipe — but I assure you I could still work ZoneEdit.
com without this knowledge.)
My wife had a business selling handmade soap featuring different essential oils 
and other natural ingredients. Her main Web site address was www.comfort
soap.com. Say she wants to test a different domain that works well with 
various subdomains, www.soapforyourfamily.com:
lavender.SoapForYourFamily.com
oatmeal.SoapForYourFamily.com
cruelty-free.SoapForYourFamily.com
With ZoneEdit.com, which is free for the first five domains (not subdomains, 
so their free service may be all you’ll ever need), she can create subdomains 
and then redirect them to specific pages on her www.comfortsoap.com 
Web site. She can even mask the pages so the subdomain is what appears 
in the visitor’s browser’s address and title bars. With this method, she can 
test different URLs (which is better, Natural.SoapForYourFamily.com or 
ChemicalFree.SoapForYourFamily.com?). She can also use different 
display URLs in different ad groups: the lavender group, the Shea-butter 
group, the neroli group, and so on.
 
Visit www.askhowie.com/zoneedit for a video tutorial on using www.
zoneedit.com for subdomain redirection.
Following Google’s Text-Ad Guidelines
I warn you about some commonly broken rules in the following sections, but 
you should still take ten minutes to read Google’s editorial guidelines at
https://adwords.google.com/select/guidelines.html

141
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
Punctuation
Google’s rules for punctuation in your AdWords ads are pretty simple:
 
✓ No more than one exclamation point in your text, and not in the headline.
 
✓ No repeated punctuation (Tired??!!).
 
✓ No unnecessary punctuation ($$ instead of money or $#!! standing in for 
an expletive).
Capitalization
The capitalization rules for AdWords ads are that you can’t use excess capi-
talization such as FREE or SIDE EFFECTS.
However, you can capitalize acronyms (MPH) as well as the first letter of each 
word in your ad and in your display URL (LeadsIntoGold.com is accept-
able; LeadsintoGOLD.com is not).
Spelling and grammar
Google doesn’t like ads that look like they were written by toddlers. Make 
sure all words are spelled correctly. If you don’t have an ear for grammar, get 
someone who does to take a look at your ad. Spell checkers can’t pick up mis-
takes like using than for then or weather for whether.
Copyright and trademark usage
You can’t use copyrighted and trademarked terms in your ads without the 
permission of the rights holder.
This is a thorny and complicated issue for Google. If you sell one brand of 
mobile phone, can you compare it to a competing brand in your ad? Can 
you use copyrighted terms in your URL? The law is still being written on this 
topic — and lawsuits are mounting between companies claiming copyright 
infringement and “initial interest confusion.” (I can throw these terms around 
thanks to my work as an expert witness at trial; obviously I’m not a lawyer 
and you should get competent legal advice before doing anything that may 
get you in trouble.)

142
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Competitive claims
If you say your business is the best, fastest, cheapest, most successful, and 
such, you need to prove it to Google (and the world) on your landing page.
Offers
If you offer it in your ad, your visitor must be able to get it easily from your 
landing page. Giving away a free trial download? Put the link in an obvious 
place on the landing page. If Google’s editors visit your site and decide your 
offer is fraudulent, your ad will be disallowed.
No offensive language
Unlike the late George Carlin, I can’t tell you the seven words you’re not 
allowed to use on Google. But if they get bleeped out of movies on TV, that’s a 
pretty good clue to omit them from your ads.
Links
The domain of your display URL must be the same as that of your Web site. 
That is, if someone typed your display URL into his browser instead of click-
ing your ad (thoughtfully saving you money!), he should still get to the same 
Web site, if not the exact same landing page.
Your destination URL must work properly and must resolve to a working Web 
page, as opposed to an e-mail address or document or multimedia file.
Exploring the Other Ad Formats
Google is constantly exploring new places and media for their ads. You can 
now create graphical ads for Web sites, text ads for mobile phones, local 
business listings that appear on search results pages and next to Google 
Maps, and video ads.

143
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
Getting the picture with image ads
Image ads are graphical files that display on content sites, but not on 
Google’s or its search partners’ results pages. Publishers can choose to dis-
play image ads instead of text ads. Perry Marshall has found that image ads 
typically generate higher CTRs than text ads, but convert to leads and sales 
at a much lower level. If you’re a Web site publisher who gets paid for clicks 
on the Google ads on your site, image ads can be very profitable because 
of their high CTRs. For you, the AdWords advertiser, the high CTR can be a 
double-edged sword. Unless you monitor ROI from each ad, you may be fund-
ing Google’s expansion at the expense of your own.
If you decide to try display ads, Google provides a Display Ad Builder that 
allows even those who failed 7th grade art to create decent graphics. You can 
find it as a link on the ad variations tab at the ad group level of your AdWords 
campaign management. Go to www.askhowie.com/adwizard for a video 
tutorial on using the tool.
Joy Milkowski of www.getmoreaccess.com offers the following four sugges-
tions if you decide to try image ads:
1. Focus on a Pain or Problem
The same principles apply to this format as to all your marketing material — 
does it clearly suggest/address a pain or problem? Often I see ads trying to 
“feature dump” instead of offering to solve an issue in simple, easy to read 
language.
2. Keep the Design Clean and Simple
Are you trying to be too busy or use colors that are too bold in order to try to 
get noticed? If yes, chances are you may be turning prospects OFF. Our eyes 
are drawn to clean, easily decipherable images and language. Image ads, 
normally, are not the place to go “Las Vegas.”
3. Show People, Not Products
Careful with using pictures of your product on the ad — often the space is so 
small that you end up either confusing the viewer or making your product 
seem less than adequate. Instead, I recommend using people. Get the viewer 
looking at a person — it’s hard to NOT notice a person looking right at you!
4. Include an Offer and a Call to Action
Your image ad needs an irresistible offer as well as a compelling call to 
action. Remember, you’re still in a direct response world. Don’t let your ego 
look at the pretty pictures and elevate branding above measurable response.

144
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 
Compared to text ads, image ads are more expensive and time-consuming 
to create, more expensive to display, and take longer to generate results. For 
these reasons, test your message, tone, offer and call to action with text ads 
before creating image ads.
Making the phone and the doorbell 
ring with mobile text ads
Google is going mobile, creating content that can be accessed and acted upon 
seamlessly from your smart mobile phone (and even from your mobile phone 
of average intelligence but with a nice smile). If your ad includes a link to a 
Web site, you have to make sure the site is created in a phone-compatible 
way. If you just want prospects to pick up the phone and call, or drive over 
and pay you a visit, create your ad and include an offer and call to action.
To create a mobile text ad, click the Mobile Text Ad link from within the Ad 
Variations tab of an ad group.
You can view your mobile text ad from your SMS-enabled phone by first reg-
istering your phone with Google at http://google.com/mobile. You can 
do this from your computer or just point your phone’s browser to http://
mobile.google.com. You can conduct searches and view maps, as well as 
access several other Google services, such as Gmail and Google News.
Waving to the neighbors with 
local business ads
If your business caters to a local market, you can still use AdWords to attract 
clients and customers. For instructions on using regular text ads for geo-
graphically limited markets, see Chapter 7. Right now you see how to create a 
local business ad that will appear as Google Maps business listings as well as 
other search results.
From within the Ad Variations tab of an ad group, click the Local Business 
Ads link just above the ad variations. On the next page, enter the business 
name and address. If you have multiple locations, you have the option to add 
additional addresses to your ad. If your business is not yet listed in Google’s 
Local Business Center, you’ll receive the following error message:
No businesses matched the address you entered.

145
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
In that case, visit www.google.com/local/add/login to add your business.
If your business is listed (mine isn’t, so I’m going to use the Dogstar Tattoo 
Co. in Durham, NC as an example in Figure 6-5), you can continue to create 
your ad.
You can add a business image and even change the icon that appears next to 
your ad. Figure 6-6 shows what the ad looks like on the Google search page.
When someone searches for your keyword in a local area on Google Maps 
(http://maps.google.com), your ad may appear on the left, below, or 
above the business listings. Clicking it brings up the ad (including phone 
number and image) as a callout from the map location, as shown in Figure 6-7.

Going Hollywood with video ads
To create a video ad that shows on content pages, click In-Line Video Ad from 
within the Ad Variations tab of an ad group. On the next page, choose an 
image (Google is very picky about the size of this image, so make sure your 
graphic designer knows the dimensions Google accepts), enter display and 
destination URLs, name your ad, and upload your video.
 
My 9-minute, 30MB QuickTime video took about 7 minutes to load with a fast 
cable-modem connection, so have a book handy if you plan on uploading lots 
of large videos.
Adriel Brunson of www.rfyvideo.com, a video advertising expert of many 
years, studied and experimented with Google video ads in 2006, and sent me 
this evaluation:
When Google offered video ads in AdWords, everyone who understood the 
power of video on the Web cheered. Unfortunately, we may have cheered 
too soon.
We wanted video ads in AdWords campaigns on Google search pages. 
What we got were video ads that only played on AdSense sites that allow 
graphical ads. Nothing for regular Google search pages. It’s not that Google 
doesn’t understand the value of including video in their searches. For a 
while, they included Video as one of the five links at the top of their search 
page. Now it’s been moved down to the top of the More . . . link.

147
 Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads
And videos have been included in the organic search results just like 
images. This makes it even more important to learn how to include 
keywords, titles, and other metadata with your online videos.
Google owns YouTube.com and all videos uploaded there are indexed fairly 
quickly. YouTube.com now accepts HD videos, so quality of online video 
is more than acceptable. Plus, YouTube.com offers decent capability for 
metadata including the ability to add your narration as closed captions. That 
means the text of your video becomes searchable.
But, sad to say, Google’s AdWords still treats video like an image ad only. If 
an AdSense publisher allows image ads, you may be able to get your video 
ad on their site. It’s been my experience that few AdSense publishers allow 
graphical ads. Most choose the default text-only option. Even the AdSense 
experts recommend text-only ads to blend in with the site navigation and 
content. No graphical ads, no video.
On the plus side, Google’s AdWords video program does offer powerful 
options. You can create both keyword and site-targeted campaigns. You can 
search for AdSense sites matching your keywords. If you find any that allow 
graphical AdSense ads, you can target those sites.
You may want to explore Google’s options for playing ads on cable channels 
in your area. The technical specs are different than online videos but it may 
be just the right way to use video to get your message to your market.
My recommendation is to create regular AdWords campaigns and drive 
traffic to a page with a good headline, embed a good video uploaded to 
YouTube.com with metadata included, and complete the page with well-
written sales copy and offer.
With a regular Google AdWords keyword-targeted campaign, you’ll get more 
control over the traffic, plus you can test everything in the chain — the 
keywords, the ad, the headline, the video placement, the text and links 
around the video. You can even test different video edits if you want.
With Google AdWords video ads, you have little or no control over these 
elements. Go with an AdWords text campaign and a split testing landing 
page with good video. It’s a much better option all the way around.
Because Google runs a blind advertising network based on keyword search 
(meaning you as an advertiser can’t tell in advance where your ads will show, 
and the publishers can’t predict accurately which ads will display on their 
pages), I recommend using Google video — if you must — only in placement-
targeted campaigns (more on this approach in Chapter 7).

keyword, write the perfect ad, and retire to Fiji while 
the money rolls in relentlessly. The reality is that as 
important as keywords and ads are, the structure of your 
AdWords campaigns will determine success or failure.
In Chapter 7, you find out how to navigate a dizzying array 
of settings, including which network(s) will display your 
ads, how to budget and set bid prices, where in the world 
and what time of day to show the ads, and others.
Chapter 8 covers the strategy most neglected by AdWords 
users: creating tight Ad Groups of similar keywords and 
relevant ads. You discover how to perform ongoing 
tune-ups of your keyword lists, bids, and ads so your 
AdWords vehicle runs ever more powerfully and 
efficiently.
Chapter 9 introduces you to the tools that Google has 
thoughtfully provided to make your AdWords life easier 
and more fulfilling. Okay, just easier.by keywords. It 
covers fundamentals and clever variations to make your 
ads more compelling and profitable.

W
hen I install a piece of software on my computer, I often get a screen 
that asks me whether I want to go ahead with the Typical Installation 
(always recommended) or the Custom Installation (for advanced users only). 
To my recollection, I’ve never chosen Custom. I always worried that I would 
install a version of Microsoft Word that wouldn’t let me type the letter M, 
didn’t have a built-in English-to-Esperanto translator, or would omit some 
other crucial feature.
Google gives you an overwhelming number of choices for configuring 
AdWords campaigns — but it doesn’t really bring them to your attention. 
Google isn’t trying to bamboozle you; instead, the default settings are 
designed to protect clueless advertisers from themselves. But you, my friend, 
are no longer a clueless advertiser. By virtue of buying this book (or at least 
spilling coffee on it at Barnes & Noble), you are hereby officially dubbed 
clueful advertiser.
In this chapter, you see how to tweak the AdWords default settings that 
aren’t appropriate for power users. You discover how to bid intelligently 
on your own and when to let Google set your bids for you. (I know Google’s 
motto is “Don’t Be Evil,” but I still wouldn’t give it complete control over my 
advertising spending.) And you figure out how to show your ads to different 
geographic areas with laser precision and how to separate your search and 
content traffic for maximum clarity and ROI.

Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
Getting the Most Out of Your Campaigns
If you want to set up one AdWords campaign, put it on autopilot, and never 
look at it again, feel free to skip this section. The changes I suggest will usu-
ally mean more, not less, work for you — more decisions, more overseeing, 
more risk, even, if you drop the ball. Google gives you a vehicle with an auto-
matic transmission that does your thinking for you. On highways, it works 
fine, although it will never be as efficient as a well-handled manual transmis-
sion. When you take it out for a race, though, you’re going to need precision 
control based on experience — something no computer can do for you. 
Ready to strap on your AdWords seatbelt and hit the track?
Changing the default campaign settings
From within the Campaigns tab of your AdWords account, click the Settings 
Rollup tab. You’ll see a list of all your campaigns along with a summary of 
settings for each, as shown in Figure 7-1. Click the campaign name to access a 
page on which you can change any or all of the settings. Some of the settings 
are shown to you when the campaign is born, whereas others hide on this 
page, waiting for you to find them. I explore some options that you haven’t 
yet seen.

 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
Audience
You can change three parameters under the Audience settings: locations, 
languages, and visitor demographics (if you are showing your ads on the con-
tent network).
Locations
Google allows you as much geographical precision as you could possibly 
need. The default setting is by country: Google gives you a list of coun-
tries and then you choose the ones whose inhabitants will see your ads. 
Straightforward and uncomplicated, this setting is common for online busi-
nesses that can serve customers pretty much anywhere. If you sell down-
loadable software or telephone consulting, for example, you don’t have any 
reason to exclude customers from Belgium, Israel, or New Zealand, assuming 
language compatibility. In my experience, certain African and Asian countries 
tend to be hotbeds of credit-card fraud, however — and if you don’t think a 
particular country will add a great deal to your bottom line, you may want to 
leave it off your list.
Click the Edit link next to Locations to take you to a recently updated inter-
face that enables you to target your campaigns as widely or as precisely as 
you desire. Under the Browse tab, Google lists the most commonly selected 
24 countries at the top, beginning with the United States and continuing 
alphabetically from Australia to United Kingdom. If you click the Show All 
Countries link at the end of the list, you’ll see a complete list of dozens of 
countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Select countries by clicking their 
check boxes. When your list is complete, click the Save button to return to 
the Edit Settings page.
The Bundles tab, as shown in Figure 7-2, enables you to choose with an even 
broader brush among 14 country bundles. Notice that these bundles over-
lap with the United States and Canada bundle contained within the North 
America bundle, and the last bundle, All Countries and Territories contains, 
you guessed it, all countries and territories.
If you want to target prospects more precisely, you can drill down into each 
country listed under the Browse tab. Click a country’s expand button (the 
plus sign next to a country’s name) to select or deselect regions/states within 
that country. Similarly, you can expand regions/states into cities/metro areas 
and metro areas into smaller cities. To select a single small city, deselect the 
country, region/state, and metro area that contain it and then select the spe-
cific city, as shown in Figure 7-3.

 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
If you run a local business, the regional and city targeting may not be precise 
enough for you. After all, no matter how good a dry cleaner you may be, few 
customers will drive 45 minutes across town to drop off their dress shirts. 
Enter customized targeting to the rescue. You get to that page by clicking the 
Custom tab. You’re given three options:
 
✓ Map point: This option designates a circular area. After entering a physi-
cal address or centering the map at your desired location (zoom way 
in by clicking the + button at the top left of the map), you can enter a 
radius around that spot in miles or kilometers. Figure 7-4 shows a radius 
of 2 miles around Ewing, New Jersey.
 
✓ Custom shape: Occasionally, a circle isn’t precise enough. What if, in 
Figure 7-4, I want to expand the area where my ads show to include the 
entire triangle between I-95, US 1, and the Delaware River? Google sends 
a multi-point option to the rescue. Click the Custom Shape link. You can 
either enter coordinates as if you’re a World War I ace, or zoom in to 
your map location and draw a polygon that defines your target area, as 
shown in Figure 7-5.
 
✓ Bulk: This option adds a bulk list of locations. Click the Bulk link. You 
can paste or type up to 100 different locations (cities, states, countries) 
to create a global patchwork of ad serving.

When you finish specifying the ad serving locations for this campaign, click 
the Save button to save your changes and return to the Campaign Settings 
page.
Language
You can specify the language(s) of the users you want to see your ads. Click 
the Edit link to bring up a list of languages from Arabic to Vietnamese. 
Demographic
If your campaign is set up to show ads on the content network, you may be 
able to see a breakdown of your data by age and sex. (Because I turn 44 this 
year, I will not be making any middle-age jokes about that last bit.) When you 
set up conversion tracking (see Chapter 14), you receive data that shows 
which sex and age groups convert at the highest rates. This data allows you 
to modulate your bid prices, so you pay less for clicks from some groups 
than others.
Networks, devices, and extensions
As you may have read in Chapter 1, you can show your text ad in any of three 
places: Google pages, search partner pages, and the content network. The 
default setting for each campaign includes all three networks. The trouble 
with this setting is that the three sources of traffic generally behave very 
differently, respond to different language and different offers, and don’t com-
mand the same bid prices. You can set different bids for the content network, 

157
 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
but a cleaner way to separate the networks is to put each one in its own 
campaign. See the section, “Separating your account into three types of cam-
paigns,” later in this chapter, for details.
Click the Edit link next to the list of current networks and devices to choose 
where and on what machines to show your ads. Click the radio button next to 
Let Me Choose to change any of these options. 
Bidding and budget
In this section, you can set the most you’re willing to pay for a click across 
various networks, and even change the way Google sets your bid prices. You 
can change the daily budget for your campaign so that you don’t end up with 
nasty surprises. 
Bidding option
Keep the default here (Focus on clicks, Manual bidding – maximum CPC bids) 
for now. Don’t let Google optimize your budget. See the section, “Bidding 
Smart,” later in this chapter, for a discussion of bidding strategies.
Position preference
Click the plus sign next to the Position Preference, Delivery Method link to 
show these advanced settings. Click the Edit link next to each item to make 
any changes.
If you enable Position Preferences by clicking the radio button next to On: 
Automatically Manage Maximum CPC Bids to Target a Preferred Position 
Range and saving your changes, you can then designate a position range for 
each keyword. Now your ad will show for a given keyword when it falls within 
that position range, and Google will try to keep your ad within that range, 
given your budget limitations.
Essentially, position preference is like setting your maximum cost per click 
(CPC), except you focus on the outcome (position) instead of the input (how 
much you’re willing to pay for that position). If you discover that your ad 
is most profitable at position 7, for example, you can tell Google to keep it 
there, instead of allowing it to fluctuate.
To play with position preference, go to the Keywords tab (from within a cam-
paign or from within an individual ad group). In the column named Position 
Preference, click the word Any to input the highest and lowest position your 
ad will appear for that keyword (see Figure 7-6). 
In Figure 7-7, I’ve configured the keyword [cold calls] to trigger ads that 
appear in position 7 only. You can edit position preferences for multiple key-
words by checking the box to the left of the keywords you wish to edit, and 
then clicking the Edit button just above the keyword list.

Delivery method
If you exceed your daily budget on a regular basis, you have two choices: tell 
Google to pace your ads evenly through the day (Standard), or show the ads 
as often as possible until you run out of money (Accelerated).
 
Both methods can make sense, depending on the viewing patterns of your 
market. If your market is global, you probably want to show your ads evenly 
so you can get your message to your prospect in Singapore as well as the 
one in Saskatoon. If you run a local campaign for office workers, you may 
want to accelerate the ad showing if more people buy in the morning than 
the afternoon.

159
 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
However, the choice begs an important question: Why are you limiting your 
advertising spend? The concept of an advertising budget doesn’t make sense 
if each ad is making money. If I offered you a dollar bill in exchange for your 
half-dollar, how many times would you want to complete that transaction? 
Does infinity sound about right to you? It wouldn’t make sense for you to say, 
“I only trade my 50 cents for your dollar 24 times because my daily budget is 
12 dollars.”
 
Limit your daily budget for testing purposes, when you’re not yet profitable 
and you’re adjusting your keywords, ads, and Web-site sales process to 
become profitable. Another case where limiting your budget makes sense is if 
demand exceeds supply and you can only service so many paying customers. 
Or if you work for a big company used to advertising that’s not directly tied to 
results, and you’re given an ad budget. Or if you haven’t read this book and 
don’t yet know what you’re doing.
In fact, as you’re assessing the competition, if you find that their ads disap-
pear and reappear on the Google search results page as you refresh the page, 
you can be fairly confident that they aren’t profitable yet or they don’t under-
stand results-accountable marketing and won’t be much of a threat to you.
Advanced settings
Actually, these settings are no more or less advanced than any of the others. 
But if you want to feel special about messing with them, you have my permis-
sion. Click the Schedule: Start Date, End Date, Ad Scheduling link to see the 
options available for scheduling your ads.
Start and end dates
You can set up campaigns to run for a predetermined time period. This is 
useful if you have a seasonal campaign (pool toys, Valentine’s Day candy, or 
Happy January 25th cards) or an event-based campaign (tickets to the World 
Cup or presidential candidate hats and t-shirts in the months leading up to 
an election). You can specify start and stop dates in advance, thus saving you 
one more thing to remember to do later. Click the Edit link to set the cam-
paign dates.
Ad scheduling
Click the Edit link next to Ad scheduling and gasp to discover that Google 
gives you the option to schedule your ads by 15-minute increments, any day 
of the week, as shown in Figure 7-8. You can run your ads from midnight to 
2:45 a.m. Monday, 3:00–3:15 a.m. Tuesday, and so on. Click the Time Period 
setting for the desired day to specify the time periods for your ads to show 
on that day. By clicking the Bid Adjustment link near the top of the page, you 
can even adjust your maximum bids by time period. You may want to be in a 
higher position on weekends, or just after The Daily Show, or during Monday 
Night Football, and so on.

Ad delivery
Click the Ad Delivery: Ad Rotation, Frequency Capping link to view the 
options here and then click the appropriate Edit link to make any changes.
Ad rotation
Hold on for a short fire and brimstone sermon about the Ad Rotation setting: 
Until you start using the Conversion Optimizer, a very advanced tool that I 
talk about at the end of this chapter, please do not optimize your ads. I don’t 
care where you are. Run, don’t walk to a Web browser, log in to your account, 
choose a campaign, click the Settings tab, click the Ad Delivery: Ad Rotation, 
Frequency Capping link, click the Edit link (next to Ad rotation), and move 
the radio button from Optimize to Rotate. Then click the Save button.
Done? Okay, now I can get rational and calm again. Let me explain why you 
made this change, and why it’s so important. When you run two ads in the 
same ad group, Google shows them to different people and gives you statis-
tics on how each ad performed (see Chapter 13 for the gory — er, glorious — 
details of split-testing). If Google optimizes your ad rotation, the ads with 
lower click through rate (CTR) are shown less and the ads with higher CTR 
are shown more. Eventually, the poor performer stops showing, and Google 
declares a winner by default. You set up the test once, and it runs without 
you from then on. What could be bad?
First, your tests take much longer when you don’t give each ad an equal 
chance to be “voted on” by searchers. You need a threshold number of 
impressions and clicks for each ad to determine a statistical winner. If one ad 
gets fewer and fewer impressions and clicks, it takes longer to declare that 
winner.

161
 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
When you can’t declare winners as they happen, you learn slower. Think of 
how fast bacteria adapt to antibiotics — because they go through so many 
generations in a short time frame. The more iteration per time frame, the 
more your ads can evolve and improve. AdWords is a playground where both 
evolution and intelligent design rule.
You also lose money because your campaigns are improving more slowly 
than they might. Ad groups that could achieve profitability in a few days, 
based on traffic, will take weeks or even months to start making money.
In the second-to-worst-case scenario, you don’t figure out anything about 
your market because you don’t even pay attention to the differences between 
the winning and losing ads. You don’t figure out which headlines work best, 
so you can’t improve your Web site, your e-mails, your expensive offline 
advertisements, and so on.
 
If you allow Google to optimize your ads, the absolute worst-case scenario 
involves Google killing off the more effective ads by mistake. Until you acti-
vate Conversion Optimizer (see later in this chapter), Google decides ad 
effectiveness based on CTR, not whether the visitors who click an ad end 
up buying. Often the highest CTR ads lose money because they attract too 
many nonbuyers.
Frequency capping
If you show ads on the content network, you can control how many times a 
unique user (the online marketing geek term for “person”) sees your ad. Click 
the Edit link to set a number of views, specify the time frame (day, week, or 
month), and tell Google whether this limit should be applied to the entire 
ad group (that is, all the ads you may be rotating), or to each individual ad 
(called a “creative” here). Because the content network is more of a “brand-
ing” medium than search, and since you don’t pay for impressions that don’t 
lead to clicks (as long as you don’t change the content network–bidding 
format), I would leave the default No Caps on Impressions. If you discover a 
very low CTR and you suspect the same uninterested people (oops, I mean 
“unique users”) are viewing your ads over and over again, you can try to limit 
impressions and see whether your numbers improve. 
Separating your account into 
three types of campaigns
By default, Google wants to show each of your ads to as many people as pos-
sible. It’s good business for them and possibly for you as well. But until you 
separate out the traffic streams and evaluate each one individually, you’ll 
never know. For most keywords, Google search converts best; search part-
ners second best; and content network worst. So it makes sense to test your 

162
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
ads and keywords where they have the greatest chance of success before 
rolling them out globally. Google is a little bit like Frank Sinatra’s “New York, 
New York:” If you can make it there, you might be able to make it anywhere.
Separating your traffic by network is a little more complicated than it ought 
to be, but that turns out to be a good thing. If it were easy, everyone would be 
doing it and you couldn’t gain a competitive advantage.
Google search
Your first campaign should probably be Google search only. Creating a 
Google only campaign is simple. On the Campaign Settings page, under 
Networks, Devices, and Extensions, click the Edit link, and then uncheck the 
Search Partners and Content Network check boxes. Google has a little snit 
when you uncheck those boxes — and warns you that your ads won’t show 
in those networks. Click the Save button and ignore the entreaty.
This campaign will now show your ads only on Google pages — not AOL 
search, not EarthLink, not Aunt Tillie’s blog. To confirm this setting, visit the 
Networks tab for this campaign and make sure Search Partners and Content 
Network are both off.
Search partners
As you’ve seen, Google happily shares its search results with AOL, EarthLink, 
and other search partners. Google and AOL users are different from each 
other in meaningful ways, and those differences can affect how they respond 
to your ads. You probably can’t predict how those differences will affect 
response, so the safest route is to separate the two streams and market to 
them separately.
On the Campaign Settings page, uncheck the Google Search box but leave the 
Search Partners box checked . . . just kidding! You can’t do it; Google won’t let 
you. You can’t target AOL without also targeting Google. You can separate the 
streams by following this process:
 
1. Create two identical campaigns (see Chapter 9 for some timesaving 
Campaign Modification tools).
 
 The two campaigns should have the same settings, same ad groups, and 
same keywords. Add the letter G (for Google) to the end of one of the 
campaign names, and add S (for Search) to the other.
 
2. Change their Networks settings as follows:
 
• Campaign G: Check Google Search, uncheck Search Partners, 
uncheck Content Network.
 
• Campaign S: Check Google Search, check Search Partners, uncheck 
Content Network.

163
 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
 
3. For the Campaign S, reduce all your bids to about five cents below the 
Campaign G bids.
You’ve created two campaigns that compete with one another for expo-
sure. When they compete head to head on Google, the Campaign G will win 
because it has the higher bids. Only Campaign S will show for the search 
partners because Campaign G isn’t configured to show for that network. 
Voilà!
Content network
You can add the content network by creating a third identical campaign, this 
one with C after the name. For Campaign C, go to the Settings tab, click the 
Edit link next to Networks and Devices, and then click the radio button next 
to Let Me Choose. Then remove the check from Google Search and select the 
radio button next to Relevant Pages across the Entire Network. Click the Save 
button, and you’ve just created a keyword-based, content-only campaign. 
Next, you’re prompted to create an ad group. Name the ad group, write your 
first ad, and choose some keywords so that Google knows what content to 
pair with your ad. Set your default bids, and click the Save Ad Group button. 
You have just told Google to show your ad on sites with content related to 
the keywords your entered.
Figure 7-9 shows a neat AdWords account with three campaigns each receiv-
ing different streams of traffic. The Google search–only campaign has the 
highest CTR, 0.87 percent, the search partner campaign is second with 0.44 
percent, and the content campaign comes in lowest with 0.07 percent. Notice 
also the difference in average CPC: The search and Google networks cost 10 
to 12 cents more per click, respectively, than the content network. These 
differences suggest that each network requires its own strategy, from ad copy 
to ad position to keywords. Unless you separate them, you’ll never discover 
what works best for each network.
 
Although people searching on Google expect organic listings and ads (after all, 
that’s why they’re searching), ads on the content network are interruptions. If 
you’re reading an article in the New York Times or managing your Gmail, you 
haven’t asked a bunch of advertisers to vie for your attention. Your content 
ads must be extremely relevant, urgent, or curiosity-provoking to compete 
against the editorial content of a Web page. Your search ads may only need to 
highlight a problem and offer a solution.
Your bidding strategy for the content network must achieve the goal of get-
ting your ad at or near the top position. Unlike a search-results page, AdSense 
pages typically show from one to five text ads. Figure 7-10 shows the online 
community, at http://psychotactics.ning.com with five AdSense ads 
on the right, next to the video. Your marketing-related ad needs to be in posi-
tions 1–5 to get any play on this social network.

Choosing content placements
If you show your ads on the content network, Google decides by default 
where to show your ads (automatic placements, based on the keywords you 
select). But you can regain control here, by telling Google to show your ads 
on specific sites (managed placements). You can set up a managed placement 
campaign by following the steps in the previous section and selecting the 
radio button next to Relevant Pages Only the Placements I Manage. You can 

165
 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
later combine the two methods by specifying keyword-optimized pages on 
specific sites (see the following section, “Combining keyword and placement 
targeting”).
To add managed placements to an automatic placement campaign, click the 
Ad Groups tab within a campaign, click an ad group name to view the details 
of that group, and then click the Networks tab. Click the Show details link 
next to Managed Placements. You’ll see a list of all your managed placements 
(none, to start), along with an Add Placements button. Click that button to 
bring up another screen with an Add Placements button. Click that button to 
access a text box where you can type the URLs of Web sites that you want to 
carry your ads. If you have no idea, click the Try the Placement Tool button 
next to the magnifying glass. 
Placement Tool
When you advertise on the content network, in addition to locations and 
languages you can also specify user demographics. Basically, you’re selecting 
a group of people in some geographic area, from a small town to the entire 
world, who visit certain Web sites. You can choose Rap/Hip-Hop fans in the 
Midwest, Progressives in South Carolina, Evangelicals in Chicago, and so on. 
Interest groups merged with geography can provide very tight, responsive 
markets for your ads.
The Placement Tool prompts you to select from categories, such as games or 
health, enter topic words, name specific Web sites, or describe your audience 
and let Google suggest Web sites matching that demographic, as shown in 
Figure 7-11.
 
Figure 7-11: 
Google can 
help you 
find the right 
sites for 
your ad in 
four ways.
 

166
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
If you type the topic Gout (as shown in Figure 7-12), Google returns a list of 
Web sites, with locations or categories on those sites, along with informa-
tion like impressions per day and supported ad formats (text, image, and 
video). You can filter the results by clicking Choose Ad Format, so if you have 
a square 300 x 250 pixel image ad, you can choose only those Web sites that 
have elected to serve ads of that size and shape.
If your desired audience is in the United States and you choose to target the 
entire country, you can choose Web sites based on demographics. In Figure 
7-13, Google will show Web sites visited by 25–44-year-old women making 
more than $60,000 a year who have children in their household. Figure 7-14 
shows the top Web sites returned for those criteria. You can select any or 
all of them to show your ad. The first one, Aintitcool.com, shares news and 
reviews of movies, DVDs, and comic books. Ask yourself, “Can I create an 
ad that will interrupt someone reading an interview with Tom Cruise about 
the next Mission Impossible movie and make him or her act on my offer? If 
so, will that person be a good prospect?” If both questions can be answered, 
“Yes,” you may have found a successful content site.

Combining keyword and

You can combine the two targeting methods — keywords and placements — 
within a single ad group. For example, if you want to show your ads on 
Webmd.com pages that are about gout, you can choose the URL webmd.com 
from the placement list, and then refine the targeting by adding gout-related 
keywords and negative keywords (say, for other kinds of arthritis) in the 
Keywords tab. This gives you much more control than using either placement 
or keyword targeting separately.
Bidding Smart
Earlier in this chapter, I urged you not to let Google automatically determine 
your bids. Eventually, when you have conversion tracking and analytics 
set up (see Chapters 14 and 15), you can adjust your bids intelligently in 
response to back-end conversion. When you first bid on a keyword, you want 
to balance three objectives: getting valid data quickly, generating high CTRs 
for your best keywords, and not losing the shirt off your back by paying too 
much for too many unprofitable clicks.
Initial bidding strategies
Richard Stokes, founder and president of AdGooroo, discusses his research-
backed bidding strategy in his book Mastering Search Advertising — How the 
Top 3% of Search Advertisers Dominate Google AdWords. He divides keywords 
into two groups:
 
✓ Niche keywords: Keywords with that are at least three words long, that 
you expect will generate high CTRs.
 
 Examples: gout foods to avoid, left-handed titanium 
driver, iPod shuffle blue case
 
 Bid to get those keywords in positions 2–3. Typically, the costs for posi-
tions 2 and 3 are not significantly higher than that for lower positions, 
while obtaining both a good CTR and conversion rate. Position 1 often 
has a significant jump in cost and tends to attract unqualified clicks.
 
✓ Broad keywords: Category terms that lots of people use at the beginning 
of their search process; these are usually one- to two-word, short-tail 
keywords.
 
 Examples: gout, golf club, iPod

169
 Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads
 
 Bid for position 7 for broad keywords. Rarely will you convert enough of 
these searches to sales to justify the extra expense of positions 1–3, and 
the traffic for these words can bankrupt you if you generate too many 
clicks before optimizing your sales process.
 
If your campaign is showing on the content network, bid to appear in posi-
tions 1–3 for text ads, and position 1 for image and video ads. Otherwise, your 
ads won’t appear enough to for you to learn (or profit) from.
When you have data . . .
The initial bidding strategies should give way to data-informed bids as soon 
as possible. After you set up conversion tracking and analytics (described 
in Chapters 14 and 15, respectively), run keyword reports and adjust each 
keyword to be profitable. One position will give you the highest ROI for each 
keyword, and you can usually find it through trial and error within a few hun-
dred clicks.
Just as this edition was going to press, I received reports from a bunch of 
AdWords power users that the Conversion Optimizer tool was improving 
their campaign performance significantly. This tool asks you how much 
you’re willing to pay for a conversion — for example, a lead or a sale. Google 
then scans the history of all your conversions in a search for the perfect 
bid price for every occasion to provide you with the most conversions at or 
below your bid. The amount of data Google considers is awesome (I mean 
that in the literal sense, not the teenager sense). The Conversion Optimizer 
fluctuates your bid based on time of day, geographic region, keyword, place-
ment site, and other variables — all in combination with each other.
To enable Conversion Optimizer, make sure your Ad Rotation setting is set to 
Optimize, not Rotate. You must run your campaign for at least a month with 
conversion tracking on, so Google can start collecting the data to optimize. 
If your campaign generates at least 30 conversions during the past 30 days, 
your campaign is eligible for Conversion Optimizer. Determine the most 
you’re willing to pay for a conversion, and then edit the Bidding Option set-
ting for the campaign. Select Focus on Conversions, enter a maximum CPA 
(cost per action), and then click the Save button.
 
When you move a campaign to Conversion Optimizer, you lose all your existing 
bids. In case things don’t work out, make sure you back up your campaign with 
the desktop AdWords Editor (see Chapter 9 for details). Also, be aware that the 
tool can take several weeks to discover improvements. The more conversions 
you generate, the faster it learns. This is one of the most powerful tools in the 
AdWords arsenal — please read the documentation carefully. You can get to it 
by clicking the question mark next to Bidding Option on the campaign settings 
page and then clicking the Learn More link at the bottom of the pop-up.

hen you place an ad in the Yellow Pages, you can’t change it until the 
next edition comes out. After the ad is in the Yellow Pages, your job is 
to answer the phone, take care of customers, and pay the electricity bill.
Your AdWords account, on the other hand, frequently needs changes and 
requires much more of your attention than a static advertisement. If you like 
metaphors, you can equate your AdWords account to auto maintenance. If 
you never change the oil, the engine will eventually die. However, with regu-
lar maintenance and tinkering, you can get it to a high-performance state 
over time — and keep it there. Your AdWords account demands more atten-
tion up front and less and less as time goes on.
In this chapter, you discover tactics for improving your AdWords campaign 
performance over time. I show you how to identify unprofitable keywords, 
and what you can try before you fire them. I help you improve CTR by group-
ing similar keywords and targeting your ads more tightly to those keywords. 
I divulge a strategy for resuscitating keywords rendered inactive because 
Google doesn’t like them. Finally, I show you a triage system that allows you 
to focus your campaign management where it will bring the highest return.

Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
Nurturing, Relocating, 
and Firing Keywords
Keywords connect people with ads. If the connection is right, the right people 
find the right ads. While your AdWords campaigns mature, you’ll discover the 
best relationships between keywords and ads. Think of your keyword list as a 
commission-only sales force, with each keyword a different sales rep driving 
up and down the Internet looking for business:
 
✓ Stars: Some of keywords are stars, bringing in customers and profits on 
a regular basis.
 
✓ Solid performers: These are good performers, making their numbers 
without complaint but not setting the world on fire.
 
✓ Long tails: Still other keywords are harmless stay-at-homes, making you 
nothing but costing you nothing either.
 
✓ Underperformers: A large number of your keywords underperform but 
might convert into solid producers by relocating to better territories.
 
✓ Negative ROI: Inevitably, you find keywords that just aren’t worth 
keeping — they may bring you some business, but their expense 
accounts far exceed the value of their leads.
The following sections look at what to do about each of these keywords.
Star keywords
I’m going to take a wild guess about your AdWords account: I predict that 
95 percent of your Web site traffic is coming from fewer than ten keywords. 
Maybe fewer than five. I know this not because I’m psychic (I knew you were 
thinking that), but because in five years of helping people with AdWords, 
most accounts I’ve seen have been tilted in that direction. In fact, it’s not 
uncommon for an online business to live or die based on a single keyword.
Your most important AdWords job is to identify star keywords and give them 
everything they need to be happy and healthy. Limos, special diets, bathtubs 
filled with Perrier — these keywords must receive ongoing attention if they 
are to perform at a high level.
Of course, keywords aren’t really pampered Hollywood stars, so my sugges-
tions in the previous paragraph are meant to be understood metaphorically. 
What keywords really want are relevant ads in the right positions taking the 
searcher to an appropriate landing page. All your keywords want this; your 
job as an advertiser is to give it to them to the extent you can. But if you’re 

173
 Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management
building your campaigns correctly, with hundreds or thousands of long-tail 
keywords, it’s easy to lump your star keywords in with the hoi polloi and lose 
a lot of potential sales.
 
Give each star keyword its own ad group and landing page. The ads in that ad 
group include the keyword at least once, possibly twice, and you check your 
split tests regularly for a winner (see Chapter 13). The landing page tells your 
visitors within 1.3 seconds that they’ve come to the right place — to the Web 
site with the answer to their deepest and most pressing desires.
If you didn’t connect with the Hollywood-stars metaphor, here’s one inspired 
by my visit to the North Carolina State Fair last fall: Your hundreds or thou-
sands of keywords are like apples in your orchard, while the star keywords 
are your prize milk-fed pumpkins. Each pumpkin gets as much attention as an 
orchard of apples. (If you need more metaphors, you’re on your own.)
Finding star keywords
To identify your star keywords, follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your AdWords account at www.google.com/adwords and 
get to the Campaign Summary page (you may be taken there by 
default).
 
2. Click the Keywords tab to show all the keywords in your account.
 
3. Click the Impr tab to sort the keywords from most to fewest 
impressions. 
 
 You should see all your keywords already sorted by impressions, as 
shown in Figure 8-1. In many accounts, the top five to ten keywords 
receive more traffic than all the rest combined. Within individual ad 
groups, this phenomenon is often even more pronounced.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The top two 
keywords 
in this ad 
group have 
received 94 
percent of 
the search 
impressions.
 

174
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
Figure 8-1 tells a typical story: The top two keywords, [gout diet] and 
gout diet, together have received 82 percent of the total search impres-
sions for this ad group (560,642 out of 597,064). A closer examination shows 
that [gout diet] is significantly underperforming in terms of traffic: Its 
average position is 8.5, putting it on the second page of search results much 
of the time. Were I to raise its bid, that keyword would generate even more 
impressions. (Whether that move would be profitable depends on the cost 
per conversion for that keyword, which you can explore in Chapter 14.)
Although it’s convenient to see all your keywords in one big list, keyword 
management is best done within individual ad groups. That way you can view 
each keyword in context, and determine its contribution to its group, and its 
relative performance. You can easily get to a keyword’s ad group by clicking 
the ad group name to the right of the keyword.
Moving a star to its own trailer
I know, back to the movie star metaphor. It just amuses me to imagine [gout 
diet] running around in dark sunglasses and a designer shirt. Giving a star 
keyword its own ad group is a three-phase process:
 
1. Create a new ad group in the same campaign as its current ad group, 
write an ad that connects strongly to the keyword, and add that key-
word only to the keyword list. Pause it immediately.
 
 If it’s an exact match, with brackets, don’t worry about negative key-
words. If it’s a phrase or broad match, include negative keywords.
 
2. Create a new landing page specifically for that keyword.
 
3. When you’re ready to send traffic to that new page, pause the key-
word in the old ad group and unpause it in the new one.
 
 If you run into problems, you can always pause the new ad group and 
unpause the old keyword.
Solid performers
Your solid performers are keywords that consistently generate decent num-
bers of impressions, but nowhere near the stratospheric output of the 
stars. In Figure 8-2, the first four keywords generate two-thirds of the total 
impressions. The next 8 keywords are the solid performers, each generating 
between 1,400 and 6,900 impressions.

175
 Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management
 
Figure 8-2: 
The key-
words from 
“cold calls” 
to making

are all solid 
performers.
 
Keywords of a feather should flock together
Look at your keywords and see whether you can group them into more 
tightly focused ad groups, based on word similarity and CTR. For example, 
the keywords in Figure 8-2 need to be divided into more tightly targeted ad 
groups, based on word similarity and CTR.
The CTRs for the eight solid performers are as follows:
Keyword
Click-Through Rate
“cold calls”
2.25%
cold calls
2.01%
cold call techniques
0.81%
[cold calling techniques]
1.20%
cold call scripts
1.14%
“cold calling techniques”
0.53%
[cold calls]
4.56%
making cold calls
1.91%

176
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
The range of CTRs is huge, with the best performing keyword, [cold 
calls], generating Web site visitors at almost nine times the rate of the 
worst performer, “cold calling techniques”. And they’re all showing 
for the same ad or ads. What this means is that the ads in this group have the 
potential to achieve a very nice 4.56% CTR, if they’re showing for the right 
keywords. The keyword “cold calling techniques” is poorly matched 
to the ads in this ad group. It should be moved to a different ad group with an 
ad and landing page more specifically targeted to that desire.
The keywords in this ad group that don’t generate enough traffic to warrant 
their own group should be divided as follows:
 
✓ Cold Calling Techniques ad group
 
• cold calling techniques
 
• [cold calling techniques]
 
• “cold calling techniques”
 
• Any other phrases that include the three words cold calling 
techniques in any order
 
• Phrases with the three words with technique misspelled or mis-
typed (for example, cold calling tehcniques)
 
• Phrases with the words cold call techniques (then split 
those out if the CTRs are different)
 
✓ Cold Calls ad group
 
• [cold calls]
 
• “cold calls”
 
• cold calls
 
• making cold calls
 
• [making cold calls]
 
✓ Cold Call Scripts ad group
 
• cold call scripts
 
• “cold call scripts”
 
• [cold call scripts]
 
• Phrases with the three words with scripts misspelled or 
mistyped (for example, scirpts)
 
• Any other phrases that include the three words cold call 
scripts in any order

177
 Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management
Determining your ad’s true potential
Sort the keywords in your ad group by the Clicks column. The keyword that’s 
received at least 30 clicks with the highest CTR represents your ad’s poten-
tial. Keywords that receive significantly lower CTRs don’t belong with that 
ad. Typically, you find that the highest CTR keywords are the ones echoed in 
the headline of the ad.
Long-tail keywords
The long-tail keywords are the ones receiving low numbers of impressions 
and the occasional click. They just don’t get enough traffic to justify their 
own ad or landing page, but collectively are worth bidding on because they 
are cheaper than other keywords and convert better because there’s less 
competition. These two factors lower your global average cost of customer 
acquisition and can mean the difference between a struggling and a dominant 
business. 
Each long tail isn’t anything to write home about, but collectively they may 
be doing more for your business than any of your top performers are. It’s 
like the hardworking character actors, lighting directors, third associate key 
grips, and assistant best boys who don’t get all the credit but without whom 
the movies don’t get made. The names in the credits at the end of the movie 
are the long-tail keywords. 
 
Your long-tail keywords can be in big, undifferentiated groups with a generic 
“problem/promise” ad: Headline describes the problem, Description Line #1 
makes a big promise, Description Line #2 includes a feature and call to action. 
(See Chapter 6 for details of ad writings.)
You will improve performance by grouping the long-tail keywords by concept. 
For the gout campaign example, I used the following concepts to group long-
tail keywords:
 
✓ Diet: Keywords related to diet indicate, as best as I can tell, potential 
customers who desire to take control and change aspects of their life-
style. Ads that reassure that such changes are quick and easy do well 
with this group.
 
✓ Food: Food keywords, on the other hand, reflect a narrower mindset 
related to specific foods to ingest or avoid, rather than a wholesale diet 
change. Ads that ask ignorance-uncovering questions (What are the 3 
worst gout foods? Is cherry juice for real?) will motivate this group.

178
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
 
✓ Remedy: People who type remedy are looking for home remedies and 
folk medicine, as opposed to drugs or prevention. They like “secrets” 
and “what doctors won’t tell you.”
 
✓ Symptom relief: People searching for gout pain, arthritis gout, 
gout symptoms, and gout treatment view gout as a disease not 
entirely under their control. An ad that immediately offers information 
about diet and lifestyle change will alienate this group. Instead, empa-
thize and offer quick results.
 
Some of your long-tail keywords may be rendered inactive by Google because 
of low search volume. If that happens, you can leave the keyword in your 
account in case lots of people start searching for it (new products and trends 
often take a while to build up search volume), or you can delete the keyword. 
Google won’t penalize your account’s quality score for low search volume key-
words. The only cost will be an account more cumbersome than necessary. 
Underperforming keywords
As we’ve seen, a keyword will underperform if it points to an ad that doesn’t 
address the right desires, or if that ad is positioned too high or too low 
(based on that keyword’s maximum CPC). If the problem is too few impres-
sions, check your average position for that keyword. Your ad may be showing 
on page 4, where few searchers are willing to go. Or your ad may be lower 
than third position in a Content Network campaign.
The quickest way to identify underperforming keywords is to create filters 
within the Keywords tab. For example, here’s how to set a filter for all key-
words with at least 200 impressions and a CTR of less than 0.2%:
 
1. From the Campaigns tab, select All Online Campaigns, either from the 
left menu, or if you’ve hidden it, from the navigation links just below 
the top tabs.
 
2. Select the date range you want to check.
 
 You can use the preset options (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, and so 
on), or select Custom Date Range and specify start and end dates.
 
3. Click the Filters and Views button on the right, just below the date 
range.
 
4. Select Filter Keywords from the drop-down list.
 
5. Change the > to < in the middle field.
 
6. Enter 0.2 in the % field.
 
7. Click the Add Another link just below the filter.

179
 Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management
 
8. Select Impressions from the drop-down list. (The > automatically 
changes to >=.)
 
9. Enter 200 in the blank number field.
 
10. (Optional) If you want to use this filter again in the future as a regu-
lar part of your AdWords management strategy, check the Save Filter 
box and give the filter a name you’ll recognize later (for example, 
Low CTR).
 
11. Click the Apply button to filter your keywords. (See Figure 8-3.)
 
Figure 8-3: 
Use filters 
to quickly 
identify 
low CTR 
keywords 
in need of 
attention.
 
 
When your keywords deliver lots of impressions but few clicks, the problem is 
the connection between the keyword and the ad. Move your keyword to an ad 
group that addresses the desire represented by that keyword, or increase your 
bid to move the ad to a more desirable position.
Negative-ROI keywords
After you set up conversion tracking (described in Chapter 14), you discover 
that some keywords appear to be doing well within the AdWords account — 
lots of traffic, good CTR — but don’t convert to sales well enough to justify 
the cost of their clicks. This type of underperformance is especially insidious 
because it’s hard to identify. In Chapter 14, I show you how to spot Expense 
Account Gluttons that cost you more than they make for you.

180
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
You deal with negative-ROI keywords by first trying the tactic just described 
for underperforming keywords: point them to better ads. If the increased CTR 
doesn’t make them profitable, add negative qualifiers such as price and other 
disincentives to click (see Chapter 6). If nothing works, you have to let them 
go. Don’t worry about them — someone else will blissfully (and cluelessly) 
continue losing money on those keywords. Just don’t let it be you.
Resuscitating Poor-Quality Keywords
Since July 2006, Google has been rolling out occasional changes to its bid 
price algorithm designed to improve the search experience (and boost its 
profits). The most important factor in determining your bid price, aside from 
what your competitors are willing to pay, is your Keyword Quality Score. 
Quality Score takes into account your CTR (the higher, the more clicks and 
the more money Google makes) and its determination of the relevance and 
quality of your landing page to that search.
The Quality Score algorithm continues to evolve, and no one outside the hal-
lowed halls of Google knows exactly what it is, but the trend is clear: Google 
wants to make money today (high CTR) and tomorrow (your customers can 
find what they want quickly and easily, with no hassle, so they continue to 
use Google as their search engine of choice).
Keywords are ranked for quality on a scale of 1 – 10, with 10 being the highest. 
Google penalizes low quality score keywords by raising the minimum bid 
needed to appear on the first page. This makes sense from their perspective — 
if your ad is generating fewer clicks for a keyword than your competitor’s ad, 
Google needs you to pay more per click to make the same amount of money for 
“renting” you the space on their search results page. 
To resuscitate a keyword, follow these steps:
 
1. Move it to a new ad group.
 
2. Write a new ad with a message targeted specifically for that keyword.
 
3. Link the ad to a new landing page written with that searcher in mind.
 
 (See Chapter 10 for landing page dos and don’ts.)
Managing the 80/20 Way
This chapter is deceptively short, because the work it asks you to do can be 
time-consuming. It’s maintenance, not setup — and it’s tempting to do mainte-
nance once and not peek under the hood again until you smell oil. (Yup, back 

181
 Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management
to the car metaphor.) Especially after you’ve divided your campaigns into 
many focused ad groups, you can find yourself drowning amid the priorities 
competing for your attention. This section gives you some guidance in answer-
ing the only question that ever matters at this point: “What do I do now?”
The 80/20 Principle states that 80 percent of your efforts lead to only 20 per-
cent of your results, while the remaining 20 percent of your efforts is respon-
sible for 80 percent of your results. The top 20 percent of your keywords will 
generate 80 percent of your clicks and sales. Don’t get hung up on the exact 
numbers — you’ll probably find that the ratio in AdWords is closer to 95/5 
or 99/1.
 
In any case, the moral is the same: Consciously focus your time and attention 
on the parts of your AdWords account that have the biggest impact on your 
profitability.
Each AdWords account is different, so I can’t give you a formula for how to 
spend your time. The key skills here are threefold:
 
✓ Know the key priorities for your business.
 
✓ Sort your campaigns, ad groups, and keyword lists by those priorities.
 
✓ Always address the issue that can provide the biggest boost to your 
bottom line.
The factor limiting the growth of most online businesses is the size of the 
reachable market. In AdWords, the reachable market consists of people 
searching for your keywords or visiting Web sites that display your ads. The 
AdWords metric for this market is impressions — instances of exposure to 
your ad.
After you log in to your account, click the Ad Groups tab and compare the 
statistics for each ad group. You’re looking to answer the question, “Which 
ad group’s improvement will have the biggest impact on my business?” 
Generally, I focus on the ad group with the highest potential number of 
impressions. In Figure 8-4, for example, the Causes of Gout PS group’s aver-
age position is 8.3, meaning it shows on the second page of search results 
and not at all in the content network. If I increase my bids, the traffic would 
increase, probably to ten times this amount.
 
If the average position of an ad group is 7 or better within a search campaign, 
or 3 or better in a content campaign, then you are theoretically getting as 
many impressions as possible. If an ad group averages position 8 or worse 
(4 for content), your ads aren’t being seen by as many people as possible.
First, sort by impressions, and note any ad groups whose average positions 
are too low. They are potential sleepers, if you can afford the bids needed to 
get your ads in front of people.

182
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
 
Figure 8-4: 
Triage your 
ad groups 
by looking 
at areas of 
potentially 
big improve-
ment.
 
Let me plug a microphone into my head so you can hear my thinking about 
Figure 8-4:
“Okay, let’s see. I have 4 big ad groups, with more than 100,000 impressions 
so far this year. The most expensive group is the top one. I’ve spent more 
than $400 on it since January. Its CTR is OK (1.23%), but I definitely can 
improve it. If I double the CTR, I would increase my Web traffic by 5,500 
people over the next couple of months. If I double the CTR on my next big-
gest group, Gout Diet, the same amount of effort would get me only 2,000 
more visitors. Oh, and look at the fourth group, Gout. The CTR is miser-
able, just 0.27%. I could probably improve it by a factor of 8, getting it to 
2.00% with a little split-testing and rearranging of keywords. That would 
give me about 2,300 additional visitors (291 × 8). And it’s usually easier to 
improve a bad ad than an OK one, so maybe that’s a good place to start.”
I click the Gout ad group and view the Networks tab (see Figure 8-5).
 
Figure 8-5: 
The 
Networks 
tab tells 
that my CTR 
problem is 
caused by 
the content 
network.
 

183
 Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management
“Oh, look, the CTR for the Search networks is 1.12%, but for Content only 
0.08%. The big problem here is the content network, where my ads are 
generating lots of impressions but few clicks.”
“Obviously my ads are aimed at people who are searching for a solution 
to their gout problem, rather than people who are reading about gout and 
need a powerful ad to interrupt them into taking action.
“Good gracious me!” (Yes, sadly, that is how I talk to myself. You have 
no idea how annoying it can be.) “I need to move the high-potential key-
words into their own ad groups, write better ads, and send them to more 
tightly targeted landing pages. Then my dime bids can get my ads on the 
first page and skyrocket my traffic without harming my ROI.”
 
When you install conversion tracking, you have another data point upon which 
to act. When you find an ad group that delivers negative ROI (see Chapter 14), 
do something at once. Attempt a fix, pause it, or delete it. However, the order in 
which you act depends on the potential value of the improvement. A miniscule 
improvement in an ad group that gets lots of impressions is more valuable than 
a big improvement in an ad group consisting of seldom-seen long-tail keywords.
As you spend time in AdWords, you’ll get the hang of where to focus, and 
you’ll develop your own rhythm and intuition for what needs adjustment. The 
main thing to keep in mind is the 80/20 question: “What can I do now that will 
make the biggest difference in results?”
 
Split-testing ads and adjusting your bids are the sexy parts of AdWords man-
agement. Putting the right keywords together with the right ads and landing 
pages is more like nailing up the studs of a house than putting in the fancy 
trim. (Yes, campers, one final metaphor for today!) Nobody visits a show 
house and says, “My, those two-by-fours sure are straight.” AdWords 
Consultant Greg Marsden e-mailed me these words of wisdom (so blame him 
for the metaphor):
Simply put, it’s the solid scalable architecture of your campaigns that needs 
to come first before you pick the curtains out and decide what color to paint 
the door of your store. Virtually everyone I’ve worked with on AdWords 
completely misses that point and spends almost all of their time, effort and a 
ton of wasted money on frantically changing their ad texts just trying to find 
a “super ad” that’ll magically double CTR and save the day.
Greg went on to relate that three items on his To-Do list increased the amount 
of traffic to his Web site by 50 percent with no loss of quality:
 
✓ Separating content and search traffic (see Chapter 7).
 
✓ Building separate keyword lists for content and search.
 
✓ Expanding and tightly grouping keywords, particularly on the content 
side.

Depression raging, he couldn’t afford the ticket on his own, so he accepted 
the offer from his notoriously stingy (and occasionally just notorious) uncle. 
Upon arriving at the ballpark, Uncle Freddie hustled them away from the 
turnstiles, around the stadium to the fence abutting the farthest outfield 
bleachers. Once there, Freddie knelt down and instructed my father to climb 
on his back and grab the top of the fence.
With a last-gasp boost by Freddie, my father vaulted the fence and toppled 
into the ballpark, right on top of a pair of cops hired to keep order at the 
raucous venue. One of the policemen roughly lifted my father up by the collar 
and inquired of the quivering youth, “Don’t you know these games are free 
for kids?”
A whole industry of third-party tools has grown up around Google AdWords. 
Some of them, in my opinion, are indispensable (see my recommendations 
in Bonus Chapter 1, available as a PDF file at www.askhowie.com/bonus
chapters). Others are convenient and may be worth it because of the time 
they save. But many are simply duplicates of free tools included (but buried) 
within your AdWords account. You may never need most of them. But in 
memory of my father’s early brush with the law, I hereby introduce you to a 
bunch of tools that come free with AdWords. Don’t let Uncle Freddie sucker 
you into missing out or paying extra.

Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
The purpose of this chapter is to give you an overview of each of the free 
tools included with your AdWords accounts and its function, so you know 
to use it when you need it. This chapter is not intended to be an in-depth 
explanation of each tool’s complete functionality. Visit www.askhowie.com/
gtools for video tutorials that show you how to use them, one step at a 
time.
Improving Your Campaigns 
with the Optimizer Tools
Google offers free tools for your ad campaign on the Tools page. To go 
to the Tools page, log on to your AdWords account, go to the Campaign 
Management page, and then click the Tools link under the Campaign 
Management tab.
Google provides four tools under the heading Optimize Your Ads that, oddly 
enough, focus entirely on keywords rather than ads. I don’t know if Google 
intended this title as a bit of cryptic wisdom, but wise it is: The quality of the 
ad is completely dependent on the match between it and the keyword that 
triggers it.
Keyword tool
You meet the Keyword tool in Chapters 4 and 5, and in this chapter I focus 
on some different uses. After you enter a keyword and click the Get Keyword 
Ideas button, select Show All from the Choose Columns to Display drop-
down menu. You’ll see several additional columns, including Advertiser 
Competition and Search Volume Trends. See Figure 9-1.
Advertiser Competition
The Advertiser Competition column shows, again in relative terms, how 
many competitors are bidding on that keyword. If the entire rectangle is 
shaded, the keyword is highly competitive, at least in terms of number of 
competitors. Don’t let large numbers of competitors scare you away from a 
keyword or a market without researching further: The competitors may be 
easy to beat through split testing (see Chapter 13) and intelligent campaign 
architecture (see Chapters 7 and 8).

187
 Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools
 
Figure 9-1: 
Many 
“mortgage” 
keywords 
show high 
competition 
(the bar is 
fully colored 
in), and a 
number of 
keywords 
show a 
striking 
increase 
in volume 
in October 
2008.
 
The rightmost column allows you to add any or all of the keywords to the 
ad group of your choosing. Notice that the column header prompts you 
for Match Type: Broad, Phrase, or Exact. The Broad match keyword is the 
default. Try changing it to Exact and see how the search volume and 
competition data change.
 
Don’t confuse the broad, phrase, and exact terms at this stage of your keyword 
research — they are likely to perform very differently. (See Chapter 5 for a 
detailed explanation of the differences between these three match types.) If 
you do use this tool for adding keywords to your ad groups, do it carefully. I 
recommend scrolling to the bottom of the page and downloading the keywords 
to a text file or spreadsheet first, before dumping them into an ad group. You’ll 
have much more control and will create better organized and better performing 
campaigns.
Cost and ad position estimates
You can also choose to display cost and ad position estimates for the key-
word list, based on a Max CPC of your choosing. Select Cost and Ad Position 
Estimates from the Choose Data to Display drop-down list, and then enter a 
value for the maximum CPC in the US Dollars (USD $) text box. If a visitor to 
your Web site is worth $4.00, for example, you can use this tool to find keywords 
that will break even at worst. Enter 4 and click the Recalculate button. (See 
Figure 9-2.)

188
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
You can sort by Estimated Ad Position to find the profitable keywords that 
will position your ad advantageously. If you’re building a comprehensive list, 
remember to repeat the process for all three keyword match types: broad, 
phrase, and exact.
 
Figure 9-2: 
These broad 
match 
keywords 
are all 
available 
for $4.00 or 
less.
 
 
To find out Google’s estimate of the CPC for each keyword for position #1, 
enter 100 (for $100) in the US Dollars (USD $) text box.
 
Google’s bid price estimates are notoriously unreliable. Don’t bet the farm or 
give up in despair based on this data. The best way to find out the actual cost 
of a click is to take that keyword live in your account. Even one or two clicks 
will give you more realistic data than all the predictive tools in the world.
Search Volume Trends
The third option in the Choose Data to Display drop-down list is Search 
Volume Trends. This option gives you the average search volume along with 
two potentially interesting modifiers: the trend over the past 12 months for 
which data has been collected (the lag is usually a couple of months), and 
the month in which the search volume was highest.
The mortgage market is steady, with most keywords’ trend lines staying pretty 
flat. A keyword like gifts shows huge seasonal fluctuation. The keywords 
birthday gifts and wedding gifts are steady, but Christmas gifts, 
personalized gifts, and unique gifts skyrocket in December and 
January and languish for the rest of the year, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
I recommend a quick check on the seasonal trends in your marketplace as 
part of your online due diligence, so you don’t start beating up on perfectly 
good campaigns in February because they’ve stopped sending you traffic.

189

market

season.
 
Possible negative keywords
The Possible Negative Keywords option from the Choose Data to Display 
drop-down list shows you related searches and gives you an easy way to hide 
your ads from searches containing irrelevant words. For example, if you sell 
soccer equipment and clothing in the United States, you would find many 
negative keywords upon entering Soccer in the text box, as shown in Figure 
9-4. If you sell Diadora shoes but not Adidas, consider adding –Adidas to 
your keyword list.
Edit your campaign’s negative keywords
This tool can save you time and hassle if each campaign represents a broad 
market. If one campaign includes ad groups for homeschooling math curricula, 
scuba gear, magic tricks, and seminars on how to take advantage of frequent-
flier-miles programs, you have no need for campaign-wide negative keywords. 
If, on the other hand, your Whiteboards campaign consisted of ad groups for 
Magnetic Whiteboards, Porcelain Whiteboards, Commercial Whiteboards, 
Whiteboard Cleaners, Whiteboard Pens, and so on, you can use this tool to 
consolidate all the negative keywords in one master list. If you create a new 
ad group, you don’t need enter the negative keywords into that group’s 
keyword list. Some negative keywords might include these:

190
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
netmeeting
Microsoft
java
msn
These keywords refer to online virtual whiteboards, not the ones that hang 
on your office walls and are ruined by the schlemiel who uses a permanent 
marker by accident.
You can generate campaign-wide negative keywords in one of two ways. You 
can enter the negative keywords manually, or “sweep” them out of individual 
ad groups into the campaign.
 
✓ Manual exclusion: First, select a campaign from the Campaign drop-
down list near the top of the page. If your campaign is new, place the 
negative keywords into the text box and click the Add Keywords button. 
You’ll see them appear in the table at the bottom of the page.
 
✓ Clean Sweep: If your ad groups already contain negative keywords, you 
can consolidate them using Clean Sweep. You can choose to sweep negative 
keywords found in every single group (choose All Ad Groups from the 
Campaign drop-down list), at least 75 percent of them, at least 50 percent 
of them, or keywords found in any ad group. After Clean Sweep runs, you 
can decide which negative keywords to apply to the entire campaign and 
which negative keywords to leave in their original groups only.
 
Figure 9-4:

keywords

 Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools
Site Exclusion tool
The Site Exclusion tool allows you to choose particular Web sites (and parts 
thereof) where you don’t want your ads to show. This tool is relevant only for 
campaigns that show in the Content network.
If you want to keep your ads off an entire Web site, enter the top-level domain 
with and without the www prefix: www.fitfam.com and fitfam.com. To 
keep your ads from showing in a specific cheesy subdomain or directory 
within a Web site, include that information: cheesysection.fitfam.com 
or www.fitfam.com/cheesysection and fitfam.com/cheesysection. 
You can also specify a particular page, such as www.fitfam.com/embarrassing
page.html for exclusion.
You must set site exclusion separately for each campaign.
IP Exclusion tool
Suppose you don’t want competitors to see your ads. Maybe you don’t want 
them to know what you’re up to. Or perhaps you suspect them of “click 
fraud” — clicking away on your ads just to cost you money. You can use the 
IP Exclusion tool to hide your ads for IP addresses that you specify. If you 
know the IP address of the server used to surf the Internet, you can enter it 
on a campaign-by-campaign basis.
Traffic Estimator tool
The Traffic Estimator can quickly help you avoid markets and market segments 
that simply don’t generate enough search volume to justify a campaign, as 
well as help you estimate your sales volume and profitability. This tool 
calculates search traffic only, from Google and its partners. It does not 
include clicks you may receive from sites on the Content network.
Begin by entering a keyword or keywords into the text box at the top of the 
page. Next, enter a very high Maximum CPC. I always start with Google’s 
maximum, $100, to find out what Google thinks I’ll have to pay to get position 
#1. Ignore the daily budget for right now. Because you’re talking about $100 
clicks, you can enjoy fantasyland a little longer.
Now, choose your customers’ languages and locations, just as you would in 
setting up a new campaign (see Chapter 7). Click Continue to see how much 
Google thinks you’ll pay for the top spot for each keyword, and how many 
clicks each one will generate. Google assumes your ads’ CTRs will be the 
same as those of current advertisers bidding on these keywords. If your ads 
are more attractive, your average CPCs will be correspondingly lower.

192
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
In Figure 9-5, the top position for Whiteboard keywords can be had for $3–$5 
per click. Assuming your ads are as appealing (or unappealing) as everyone 
else’s, Google thinks you’ll be parting with $480–$660 per day for the privilege 
of showing your ads in position #1 to viewers in the U.S. and Canada. Based 
on its data for ads showing at that position for these keywords, Google 
estimates 108–117 visitors per day to your Web site (let’s call it 112.5 on 
average). If your Web site can turn exactly 3 percent of your visitors into 
paying customers, and your average order amount is $500 at a 50 percent 
profit margin, then your gross daily profit from this campaign will be, on 
average, $843.75 ($500 × .50 margin × 3.375 sales). Subtracting the daily 
advertising spend (let’s call it $520), your net at the end of each day is $323.75.
 
Figure 9-5: 
Google 
estimates 
your daily 
clicks and 
cost per 
day for your 
keywords, 
based on 
how much 
you’re 
willing to bid 
and where 
you intend 
to show 
your ads.
 
Download this table as a spreadsheet readable by Microsoft Excel by clicking 
the Download as .csv button at the bottom of the page. After you’ve saved 
the table, enter a saner amount in the Maximum CPC text box at the top left, 
and then click the Get New Estimates button. In Figure 9-6, you can see the 
results of capping your maximum bid at $2.00.
Now you get around 80 clicks per day for around $120. Assuming the same 
Web-site conversion process, you average 2.4 sales per day, for a daily profit 
of $600.00. Subtracting your AdWords costs leaves you with $480 net profit. 
Bidding lower and generating fewer clicks appears more profitable, based on 
this simulation.

193
 Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools
 
Figure 9-6: 
Dropping 
your bid 
to $2.00 
produces 
almost as 
many clicks 
at a much 
lower 
estimated 
daily cost.
 
 
The Web-site conversion for clicks not from position #1 is likely to be higher, 
because your ad attracts fewer happy clickers and more serious prospects. 
The lower bid is likely to be even more profitable than the preceding scenario 
projects.
Keep playing with the Maximum CPC until you find the scenario that produces 
the highest net profit. You can become even more granular by adding individual 
Max CPCs to the keywords, using the keyword**1.50 format on the first 
page of the Traffic Estimator. Until you track the actual sales performance of 
keywords (so you know exactly the optimal bid for profitability), the Traffic 
Estimator is a good place to start.
Insights for Search tool
This recent addition to the AdWords tool family will help you explore sea-
sonal trends and geographic distribution of keywords. It has far too many 
features to describe here. If you want to know where in the world the most 
people search for ramen noodles or when Campus Ladies was hot, this 
tool provides hours of fun.

Getting Feedback from Google with 
the Ad Performance Tools
When you put an ad in your local paper or hire a kid to wear a chicken suit in 
July and hand out flyers for your Buffalo Wings Shack, it’s pretty easy to tell 
whether the ad appears or the kid shows up and shakes his tail feathers. The 
world of online advertising is not so apparent, so Google provides some tools 
to help you monitor where and when your ads are showing.
To use the Ad Performance tools, log on to your AdWords account, go to the 
Campaign Management page, and click the Tools link under the Campaign 
Management tab. Click the link for the tool you want to try out under the 
Analyze Your Ad Performance heading.
The Conversion Tracking tool is important enough to merit its very own 
chapter, so I don’t belabor it in this chapter. Flip to Chapter 14 to find out all 
about the Conversion Tracking tool.
Ads Diagnostic tool
Want to find out whether searchers are seeing your ads for your favorite 
keywords? Click the Ads Diagnostic Tool link on the Tools page. With the Ads 
Diagnostic tool, you can enter a keyword, choose parameters, and ask Google 
to indicate the ads that appear for a given search term. In Figure 9-7, Google 
will show the ads that appear in the Chicago, IL area for the phrase-match 
keyword IT consultant.
 
Note that you are not limited to the straight www.google.com search; 
you can also check other Google domains, such as maps.google.com or 
google.co.za (the South African Google home page), by entering the URL in 
the Google Domain text box. You can specify a geographic location, just as you 
do when targeting a campaign, choose the language(s) your customers speak, 
and even specify individual IP addresses for laser targeting. This is very useful 
for advertisers who can’t see what their far-flung prospects in other regions or 
countries are viewing during searches.
Google offers a second option to diagnose a missing ad. Option 2: Search 
Results Page URL, at the bottom of the page, allows you to paste the entire 
URL of a search page into the Search Results Page URL text box. To use this 
option, open another Web browser window, perform a Google search, and 
then select and copy the entire text of the URL in the Address bar.

To be sure you’ve selected the entire address, perform the following steps:
 
1. Right-click anywhere within the URL in the Address bar and choose 
Select All.
 
2. Right-click again and choose Copy.
 
3. Return to the Ad Diagnostic tool, right-click your cursor in the 
Option 2 text box, and then select Paste.
 
4. Click the Continue button.
For either option, when you click the Continue button, Google shows you not 
only the ads that will show for that keyword, but also the ads that you would 
like to show, but aren’t. Google also provides tips and strategies for fixing the 
problem, as shown in Figure 9-8.

196
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 
 
Figure 9-8: 
Google 
explains 
why your 
ads aren’t 
showing 
and what 
you can do 
to fix them.
 
Your ad might be slacking off for a number of reasons:
 
✓ Ad not showing on first page: Your ad is showing, but not on the first 
page. Google suggests raising your minimum bid, increasing your CTR, 
or targeting more specific keywords.
 
✓ Ad not shown because of low quality keyword: Google gives each 
keyword a quality score (see Chapter 7). If your keyword quality is Poor 
or OK, Google penalizes you by making that keyword more expensive. 
Your options here include improving the keyword-to-ad-to-landing-page 
match (opening your mind) or bidding higher (opening your wallet).
 
✓ Ad not shown because one of your other ads is showing for this key-
word: Google lets your campaigns and ad groups compete against each 
other, but will let only one win at a time. You won’t see two of your ads 
showing for the same keyword, even if you bid on that keyword in mul-
tiple ad groups or campaigns. Google chooses the one with the highest 
ranking, which generally means the one that makes Google the most 
money (they aren’t stupid). If you want the missing ad to show, either 
decrease the duplicate keyword(s) or raise your bid on this keyword.
 
✓ Ad not shown because of paused campaign, ad group, or keyword: If 
you pause a part of your account, Google stops showing it. Obvious, yes, 
but when accounts get large, it’s easy to forget that you never turned 
that ad group back on after pausing it for maintenance.

197
 Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools
 
✓ Ad not shown because negative keyword or Non-Family Safe 
classification is preventing your ad from showing: If you dump a lot 
of negative keywords into your campaigns or ad groups, you may 
inadvertently cause a conflict between a positive and negative keyword. 
The Non-Family Safe classification means that your ad is deemed 
inappropriate for minors, and will be shown only to searchers who turn 
off the adult filters (few do). Unless you’re selling adult entertainment (I 
love that euphemism!), make sure your ads would be at home on Captain 
Kangaroo.
 
✓ Ad not shown because disapproved ads or keywords: If your ad is 
disapproved due to a violation of Google’s editorial guidelines (see 
https://adwords.google.com/select/guidelines.html for the 
actual document you “signed” when you gave Google your first five 
dollars), use the tool in the next section to discover possible remedies.
Ads Preview tool
I know you want to deduct that 45-country trip as a business expense, but 
it’s not necessary to travel to see the Google search results from around the 
world. Simply enter a keyword, domain, and language; and then choose a 
country and region to view (but not interact with) the Google results page 
that searchers in that area would see.
 
If you use Firefox for your Web browser, there’s a cool third-party tool put out 
by Redfly Marketing that has more functionality than the Ads Preview tool 
(and which you can use right on the search results page). Find it at http://
askhowie.com/redflytool.
Disapproved ads
I’m such a good boy that I can’t show you screen shots for disapproved ads. 
The best I can do is let you see what happens when I try to write one, as 
shown in Figure 9-9.
Some ads can be fixed by requesting exceptions. If you sell MAS90 accounting 
software, originally created by Best Software, you may be able to use the Best 
brand name. If you use a medical term in an ad, you may trigger the “Uh-oh, 
it’s a Canadian Pharmacy” policy. Click the Request an Exception link and 
explain to a live Google editor why this rule doesn’t apply to your ad or 
keyword in 300 characters or fewer (now’s not a good time to go into your 
childhood).

My Change History tool
The My Change History tool was created for those suffering from CRetTNS 
(Can’t Remember to Take Notes Syndrome). You can find specific changes by 
filtering out the irrelevant ones. Google allows you to filter changes by date, 
campaign and ad group, users (in case you set up more than one user for 
your account), and type of change.
 
I find this tool useful when I want to examine my campaign or run a report to 
see the effects of a particular change. You can specify start and end dates in 
the Campaign Summary control panel and in reports. The My Change History 
tool helps you remember which dates to select to get a clean experiment.
For example, let’s say you lowered a bunch of bids around the beginning of 
March, but you can’t remember exactly when, and you want to see the effect 
this change has had on your business.
Figure 9-10 shows three Max CPC changes, two on February 13 and one on 
March 2 at 1:30 p.m. You can now look at the two weeks prior to March 2 and 
the two weeks following March 2 (for example) to compare your statistics for 
these two phases of the experiment. You can look at impressions, clicks, 
average position, total cost, conversions, sales, and such. If the only differ-
ence in the two periods is the change you identified, you have learned some-
thing by isolating that variable in time using the My Change History tool.

Even though you can fall back on this tool, please spend a buck on a notebook 
and pretend you’re in high school chemistry class again. Taking notes on your 
questions and changes helps you monitor your account more seriously, and 
puts you in an observant and curious AdWords mindset.
Website Optimizer
This tool is so cool, it deserves — and gets — its own chapter (Chapter 14).
AdWords Editor
AdWords Editor is a free desktop program that allows you to make changes 
to your AdWords account while you’re offline. After you download it to your 
computer (they have PC and Mac versions), you can copy and paste ads, 
keywords, ad groups, and even entire campaigns in seconds.
AdWords Editor includes powerful search features. For example, you can find, 
all in one list, every ad that includes a particular destination URL. If you need 
to change that URL, you can do it globally via the editor, instead of piecemeal 
in the online AdWords interface.
As AdWords consultant David Rothwell of AdWordsAnswers.com points out, 
you can also use the editor to back up your account, in case your account is 
hacked or you just make a bunch of changes you later regret.

In this part . . .
U
p to this page, the book has been devoted to 
AdWords. In other words, you now know how to 
give money to Google. This part shows you how to make 
money from paying customers — hopefully, more than 
you spend on AdWords.
In Chapter 10, I cover the vital importance of dedicated 
landing pages that quickly begin scratching the itch 
expressed in the keyword and inflamed in the ad. You 
uncover how to get your visitors to say “This is for me” 
within one second of their arrival at your site.
I expound on my favorite topic, e-mail follow-up, in 
Chapter 11. No matter how wonderful your Web site, if 
you don’t stay in touch with prospects and customers, 
they forget all about you. This chapter gives you the 
strategies to stay in touch with your Web site’s visitors 
long after they leave your site and shows you stunningly 
powerful and inexpensive tools that put follow-up on 
autopilot.
Chapter 12 covers a wide array of other Web-site 
strategies, all of them based on the time-tested principles 
of direct marketing: engagement, calls to action, and 
ascending levels of value exchange and intimacy.

Chapter 10
Giving Your Customer a Soft 
Landing on Your Web Site
In This Chapter
▶ Creating relevant landing pages
▶ Establishing the credibility of your online store
▶ Getting your visitor to take action
▶ Capturing the lead
W
hen (potential) customers click your ad and your Web site appears, 
they will decide to stay and shop or return to Google within seven 
seconds. Everything about your landing page will either persuade your visi-
tor to stay and play, or hit the Back button and never darken your door again.
Don’t just send customers to your site’s home page. You have the ability to 
send your visitors to the page of their dreams, the one that quickly grants 
them their fondest wish, that scratches the itch they’ve never quite been able 
to reach before, that dreams the impossible dream — sorry, I was channeling 
Richard Kiley there for a minute. Deep breath. Orchestra fades. Where was I?
The text, the pictures, the design, the loading speed, the contact information, 
the logos, the multimedia, and the opportunities for interaction all combine 
to create a gestalt, an instant impression of Perfect Fit, Run Away Screaming, 
or something in between. Old-school direct marketers have favored text over 
graphics, based on years of experience with ugly magazine ads and Courier-
font, direct-mail sales letters. That works for some markets, but not most. 
The Web is a different medium from print, one in which design speaks as 
loudly as words.
Your AdWords landing page must impress two suitors: Google, and your Web 
site’s visitor. This chapter shows you how to make landing pages that are 
highly relevant to the keywords and ads that point to them. You discover the 

204
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
most important purpose of a landing page, along with several strategies for 
achieving that purpose. You find out a few sneaky tricks for building multiple 
landing pages by doing the work just once. I show you the elements of a land-
ing page that you can tweak to improve performance, and discuss briefly the 
things you need to know about search engine optimization to increase the 
quality scores of the keywords pointing to your landing pages.
Making Your Visitor Shout 
“That’s for Me!”
Perry Marshall of www.perrymarshall.com shares a wallet-walloping cal-
culation that should convince you to spend a lot of quality time working on 
your landing pages:
Let’s say you pay 50 cents for a click and Barbara in Oregon goes to your 
Web site and spends eight seconds seeing what you’re selling . . . then 
leaves.
50 cents divided by 8 seconds is $225.00 per hour.
Barbara in Oregon’s attention is pretty expensive, wouldn’t you say?
Now, maybe Barbara was never your customer. She clicked because your 
ad aroused her curiosity, or was cute, or implied or promised something for 
nothing. Oh, well, can’t win them all. But most Web site owners are told to 
be satisfied with conversion percentages that are pathetically low: half a 
percent, one percent. The Web is a numbers game, they’re told. Get enough 
traffic and even a mediocre site can pay the rent.
The Web is a numbers game, true. But who says you have to be satisfied with 
the numbers? The entire premise of AdWords — in fact, the feature that rock-
eted AdWords past what is now Yahoo! Search Marketing within months of its 
birth — was the ease with which campaigns could be tested and improved. 
This improvement doesn’t have to stop at the AdWords border with your 
Web site. You can deploy the market intelligence you gain by testing key-
words and ad copy to create compelling landing pages that continue to 
attract and guide your best prospects.
The goal of each landing page is to build an instant emotional bond with your 
prospects, show them you understand their needs, and can take away their 
pains. From that platform, you present your offer and guide them to take

action. Your home page, the one that says, “Welcome to Acme Online Sock 
Emporium,” is hardly ever the right place to take AdWords traffic. If someone 
walked into your retail Sock Emporium and told you, “I’m looking for red-and-
white-striped, over-the-calf dress socks,” you wouldn’t take them back to the 
front door and say, “Welcome to Acme Sock Emporium, for the finest in men’s 
and ladies’ dress and casual socks; sporting socks; and never-washed, vin-
tage baseball stirrup socks worn by members of the 1958 Championship New 
York Yankees.” Instead, you’d lead them directly to the wall displaying the 
red-and-white-striped, over-the-calf dress socks and ask them, “What size?” 
That level of specificity is the purpose of your landing page.
Your retail sock store is probably not located next to other sock stores. But 
your online store’s landing page is precisely two clicks away from just about 
every other online sock store in existence. If your landing page doesn’t look 
like the next point on the shortest distance between your prospect’s A and 
B, whoosh! Barbara from Oregon is here one second, Oregon the next. (Hah! 
Chapter 10 and my first pun. My sister owes me a dollar.)
Achieving relevance based on keywords
As I discuss in Chapter 5, keywords are the keys to your search visitors’ 
desires. You bundle similar desires into ad groups, and send the traffic from 
each ad group to a landing page focused on that desire. Everything true 
about ad copy is also true about Web site copy; the message, the tone, the 
balance of features and benefits, the next call to action all must connect with 
the conversation already going on in your prospect’s mind. The only differ-
ence is, on the Web site you are free from the space constraints and most 
of the editorial shackles imposed by Google. With great power comes great 
responsibility, as Peter Parker, another famous Webmaster, learned the hard 
way in the Spider-Man comics. Use the power of your Web site to focus not 
on your business, but on your customer’s desires as suggested by their 
keywords and the ad that triggered their visit.
If your traffic is derived from AdSense, you don’t have a specific keyword to 
build on. Instead, you know which ad interrupted them like a talking white 
rabbit and caused them to detour into the rabbit hole of your site. In that 
case, your landing page should continue the conversation begun by the ad.
For example, if you sell computer training videos on DVD, part of your 
AdWords account and landing pages might look like the example shown in 
Table 10-1.

Product-focused landing pages
If you sell physical products, like home office telephone systems or paper 
shredders or runners’ watches with GPS, your landing page presents the 
most specific product you can offer, based on keyword and ad. The keyword 
runners watch takes visitors to your entire display of runners’ watches. 
Casio runners watch produces a page dedicated to that brand (or, if 
you don’t carry Casio, make it a turn-the-corner page that explains why your 
watches are superior to Casio’s). And a search for Casio GPR-100 should 
take them to a page devoted to that particular watch.
Concept-focused landing pages
Many online stores do not sell a wide variety of merchandise. Instead, they 
sell one or two items that solve a certain range of problems. For example, 
maybe you’ve invented a clever filing system that automatically purges old 

207
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
files, or reminds people when to pay the energy bill, or sends flowers and 
chocolate to key people on Valentine’s Day. You probably will generate most 
of your traffic not from searches for the solution (because people don’t yet 
know it exists), but from descriptions of the problem:
paper clutter
messy filing system
messy office
Or they search for the one aspect of a potential solution that resonates with 
them at that moment:
bill pay reminder system
self-purging files
holiday and birthday reminders
Each of the six keywords listed previously should go to a specific land-
ing page that addresses that problem or need. The final destination will be 
the same for all buyers, but the paths they take from problem to solution 
depends on where they’re starting.
Turn-the-corner landing pages
Sometimes the thing you’re selling is related only tangentially to what your 
prospect is looking for at first. The entire field of consultative sales is based 
on the premise that your prospects don’t really know what they need, and 
your value as a salesperson is to help them discover “the need behind the 
need” and help them solve their problem at the most fundamental level. For 
example, many visitors to www.leadsintogold.com searched for ways to 
improve their cold-calling performance. The Web site doesn’t offer any sug-
gestions or tools for cold calling, except to stop doing it. The job of my land-
ing page is to get my visitor to turn the corner from “I’ve got to learn how to 
make better cold calls” to “Cold calling is a flawed strategy, and here’s a strat-
egy that works much better.”
Pleasing Google with the Title tag
At the very top of your Web browser, above the URL even, you can read the 
“title” of the page you’re visiting. For example, the title for www.askhowie.
com is “askHowie.com ~ AdWords Help, Advice and Tools.” The title tells 
Google what your page is about. (Most human visitors to your site never 
even notice the title, so use it to show Google the connection between your 
keyword and your landing page.)

208
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
You or your Web master can edit the title tag in any HTML authoring pro-
gram. You can find it in the source code for your page, near the top:
<title>askHowie.com ~ AdWords Help, Advice and Tools</
title>
If your landing page has a nondescriptive title, like “Page 3” or “Welcome to 
VintageDirtySocks.com,” Google will charge you more for clicks to punish you 
for sending traffic to a nonrelevant page.
Using PHP to increase relevance
Through the magic of a programming language called PHP, which either 
stands for Personal Home Page or PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (thrilling fans 
of recursiveness everywhere), you can increase the relevance of your landing 
page based on your visitor’s keyword, geographic location, type of computer, 
and several other factors.
Online marketing coach and PHP consultant Rob Goyette has been quoted 
as saying, in a phrase borrowed from Napoleon Hill, “Anything the mind can 
conceive, PHP can achieve.” Following are some of Rob’s favorite uses of 
PHP on landing pages. You may be able to use dynamic keyword insertion 
(described in the next section) on your own, but the rest of the applications 
require considerable PHP expertise combined with marketing savvy. As they 
say in the car ads, “Professional driver on closed course. Do not try this at 
home.” Meaning, of course, that the following sections describe what’s pos-
sible with PHP, but you will need to be, or work with, an experienced Web site 
programmer to achieve those results. I can’t go into detail about program-
ming Web sites, because I don’t know squat about it — I mean, it’s beyond 
the scope of this book.
Dynamic keyword insertion
Chapter 6 shows how you can include the exact keyword in your ad through 
a technique called dynamic keyword insertion. You can configure your land-
ing page to perform the same trick. For example, if your visitor surfed to your 
site on the keyword messy office, you can insert that phrase anywhere 
you like in your headline, your page text, or your call to action. You’ll need to 
configure the destination URL for each keyword individually; then add PHP 
code where you want the keyword to appear on the landing page.
 
If your Web site consists of .html files (rather than .php), you need to enable 
PHP in your .htaccess file. If you don’t know what this means, ask your 
Webmaster or Web site host.

209
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
Magically changing the landing page based on keywords
The first Harry Potter book featured a cool gizmo called the Mirror of Erised. 
People who looked into the mirror saw an image of what their heart desired 
most. An advanced PHP application turns your landing pages into Mirrors 
of Erised based on keywords. This function allows you to create one land-
ing page that changes itself like a magic mirror. You save a lot of time by not 
having to create new pages for each keyword. A site selling college sports 
clothing and gear could create PHP code that would show Duke basketball 
shirts and sweatshirts to visitors who arrived with Duke and basketball in 
their keyword, and similarly create a UNC page for UNC fans.
Likewise, baseball, lacrosse, basketball, Missouri, Gators, and 
Princeton would all trigger the dynamic creation of other pages, specifi-
cally mirroring the desires suggested by the keywords. The program would 
also serve a default page for keywords not in its database.
Split-testing with cookies
Split-testing, which I cover in Chapter 13, is one of the most powerful tools 
at your disposal. You can use cookies (tiny snippets of code that identify 
an individual computer as having visited before — like having your hand 
stamped at a carnival, except each stamp has your name and address on it) 
along with PHP to discover which of two different landing pages is doing a 
better job of converting visitors into leads and sales. You can test headlines, 
bullets, offers, guarantees, frequently asked questions, placement of forms 
and buttons and links, as well as colors, fonts, inclusion or exclusion of video 
or audio, or just about anything else. Done correctly, you don’t have to worry 
about your visitors seeing multiple versions of the same page. When a visitor 
returns to your page, the cookie your site places on her computer tells your 
Web server to show the first version she saw (provided the visitor is using 
the same computer).
Survey to customized sales letter or report
Ask your customers what they’re looking for before showing them content. 
Insert their answers into your page, or show them different content based 
on their answers. If you sell a diet plan, you can show different sales letters 
to vegetarians and meat eaters, people who travel a lot and people who 
don’t, and people with diabetes or wheat allergies or berry phobias. If your 
site asks visitors to opt in (see Chapter 11) in exchange for a free e-book or 
report, PHP can customize those as well.
Based on location
When you surf the Web, the sites you visit know a lot about you, including 
where your ISP is located. You could program your landing page to show Duke 
basketball tank tops to visitors from Hawaii and fleece hooded sweatshirts to 

210
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
visitors from Wisconsin. You can display local phone numbers and store 
locations, and even translate your site into different languages based on the 
physical location of your visitor.
Based on operating system
You can show different pages to Windows, Mac, and Linux users, a valuable 
feature if you sell software. Instead of prompting your visitor with too many 
choices, simply provide the download link appropriate to the visitor’s operat-
ing system.
Scraping the Internet
You can triangulate your visitor’s geographical location with other informa-
tion you can find and scrape from the Internet, such as the local weather and 
traffic reports. I could program www.fitfam.com to greet you with, “Hey, it’s 
noon your time, and it’s sunny and warm today. Here’s a great exercise you 
can do in your back yard that will only take five minutes.”
Scratching your customer’s itch
Showing a “That’s for Me” page will keep your visitor on your site for 30 
seconds rather than 8. Your next task is to scratch their itch by fulfilling the 
promise of your ad.
Giving them what they want
If your prospects know exactly what they want, then give it to them. Are they 
ready to buy an Epiphone Les Paul Special II Sunburst electric guitar? Put a 
photo, a price, a shipping policy, and a Buy Now button right on the landing 
page. Are they looking for more information to help them decide what to do 
next? Give them the information. Do they need to talk to a real human being? 
Put a phone number on your site and hire someone to answer it 24/7, or 
during business hours, or whenever your customers call.
Agitating the problem
I don’t want to get too disgusting here (actually, I don’t mind, but my editor 
does), but I have to point out something important about this itch meta-
phor. Scratching an itch feels good for a while, but actually makes the itch 
worse. Sometimes you can scratch so hard that it turns red and swollen and 
bleeds. Sometimes in the sales process, you have to agitate the problem 
and make your prospect feel even worse before they will take action.
If you sell a product that prevents rather than cures, you must be willing 
to paint the awful picture of what happens when the preventable event — 
hard drive crash, flood, heart disease, death without a will, yellow teeth, 
whatever — occurs. Scratching the itch in a case like that means taking 

211
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
advantage of your visitors’ momentary spasm of responsibility and making 
them quake with fear at the prospect of not addressing the issue this very 
minute, and trembling with relief at having found you.
Guiding them with a headline
Each page on your Web site is about something. The headline — a prominent 
phrase or sentence near the top of the page — helps your visitor decide 
whether to spend time on a page by summarizing the content, promising a 
benefit, or tickling curiosity. Imagine a newspaper without headlines, just 
articles. How would you decide what to read and what to skip? The headline 
is a relevance shortcut that also primes the reader for the message to follow.
Establishing credibility
In his popular book Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking, (published by 
Little, Brown and Company), Malcolm Gladwell shows how we make snap judg-
ments about most things before we’ve even thought about them. The neural 
pathways that establish an emotional reaction are pre-thought. Before your 
prospect has read a word, identified the subject of a photograph, or listened to 
a word of audio, they’ve already decided whether they like you and trust you. 
They’ll never be able to tell you why they feel the way they do because those 
decisions are outside of consciousness. They’ll come up with justifications for 
their gut reactions, but are usually clueless as to the real causes.
Overall look and feel
Visitors will react instinctively to the design of your landing page. They will 
assume things about you based on logos, colors, shapes, border styles, text 
fonts and sizes, and movement. Different markets respond to different gestalts. 
If you’re selling a “secret” of some sort, don’t put up a standard corporate Web 
site. If you want to appear like an established company, spend some money on 
elegant design elements rather than putting up an ugly sales letter. If you offer 
bereavement counseling, use a subdued color palette. If you sell violent video 
games, consider light text on a black background. And so on.
The Web site www.probasketballreferee.com tested two landing pages, 
identical in every respect except for the border and the header. (See Figure 
10-1.) The second page, lacking the graphic elements, received twice as many 
opt-ins as the first.
Photographs can enhance credibility, especially in a medium comprised 
entirely of electrons. Show visitors your face, your store, your warehouse, 
your products. Asepco, a firm that manufactures valves for the pharmaceuti-
cal industry, put a photo slide show on its site that documented the odyssey 
of one of its valves from the mountain where the ore was mined to the fin-
ished product. It changes location frequently, so check www.askhowie.com/
valve for the updated Web address.

213
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
Basically, you want to subliminally get across the message that “this trust-
worthy business will be around tomorrow.” To achieve this, visit successful 
competitors’ sites, talk to graphic designers, and test different designs just as 
the Pro Basketball Referee site did.
Specific visual cues
In addition to the overall look and feel, you can add specific graphical ele-
ments that lend credibility by association, as shown in Figure 10-2. These 
include credit card logos, PayPal, credit card processors like VeriSign; ship-
pers’ logos (such as those of UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service); as well 
as Web site certifications, such as the Better Business Bureau’s BBB Online 
Reliability Program, Hacker Safe, and Trust-e.
 
Figure 10-2: 
The My 
Wedding

a large 
amount of 
space to 
“credibility-

logos.
 
Another type of visual reassurance is the presence of subliminal “I Am Not a 
Crook” links, including privacy policy, Web site terms and conditions, ship-
ping and refund policies, disclaimers, and so on. I’m not sure anyone actually 
reads these documents, but their very presence can be reassuring.
Finally, the more contact options you include, the less you look like a fly-by-
night with something to hide. Post office boxes don’t cut it; instead, get a real 
mailing address that gives the impression of an office. Give a phone number. 
Put your e-mail address where people can find it.

214
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
 
When you display your e-mail address on your Web site, put it in an image file 
rather than a live link. This will prevent spambots from harvesting it and send-
ing you hundreds of unwanted e-mails every day.
Defining the Most Desirable Action 
for the Landing Page
Before creating your landing pages, as well as every page on your site, ask 
yourself the big question: What’s the one thing I want my visitor to do as 
a result of visiting this page? The possible actions include reading, watch-
ing, and listening; clicking a link; completing a form; making or requesting a 
phone call; or engaging in live chat.
Most clients I’ve worked with can identify a “point of no return” for their cus-
tomers; a place in the sales cycle that, once reached, typically leads to a sale. 
For example:
 
✓ “Once they request the free DVD, 90 percent of them become customers.”
 
✓ “Once I get them to call, I sell 75 percent of them right there on the phone.”
 
✓ “After they request a quote, almost all of them sign up for the service.”
If you have a step in your sales process that converts lookers to buyers, then 
everything about your landing page should be engineered to get as many visi-
tors to that step as possible. And in most cases, the first step on the way to 
the point of no return is getting your visitor’s e-mail address.
“Bribing” your visitor to opt in
Sometimes your landing page can go for the sale. In other cases, your pros-
pect needs more information or more time before taking out a credit card. In 
either case, the big goal of your landing page is to make sure your visitors do 
not leave your site without giving you a way of contacting them in the future. 
If that way also includes a financial transaction, so much the better. But it’s 
often more profitable to aim for a second date than to propose marriage on 
the first date.
Business on the Internet is a multi-step process — a series of small, safe, 
mutual commitments that allow your prospect to begin to trust you — and 
allow you to qualify the prospect. This process is the business equivalent 
of dating. Your job is to get on your prospects’ wavelength so quickly and 
completely that they regard you as their “one and only.” Remember, the page 

215
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
after your landing page is three clicks away from your competitor, using the 
Back button. The deeper they go, the more of a psychological commitment 
they’re making to you.
An opt-in, in Internet marketing parlance, refers to a visitor who has given 
you an e-mail address, at the very least, before leaving your site. Essentially, 
an opt-in is permission to call them for a date. In the old days of the Internet 
(pre-2001), all you had to do was offer a free newsletter to get opt-ins. These 
days, with everyone protecting their e-mail inboxes from mountains of spam, 
visitors hesitate to sign up for anything. The last thing they need is more 
e-mail from someone else trying to sell them something, even if you’re not 
peddling fake Rolexes and enlarged body parts.
In order to get their e-mail address and permission to follow up, you need to 
demonstrate value and promise future value. www.leadsintogold.com con-
tains a long letter about cold calling and its alternatives, which many people 
have told me is eye-opening in its own right. In several places on the home 
page, I offer visitors a chance to download two free chapters of Leads into 
Gold, so they can sample the product before making a buying decision (as 
shown in Figure 10-3). The request for the opt-in makes sense because I need 
their e-mail address to send them the free chapters. It is natural, not forced, so 
it works well. Note that I also ask for their names, which gives me the ability to 
address my follow-up e-mails to them personally (“Dear Ralph Lauren”).

216
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Many marketers make the opt-in the only option on the landing page. The so-
called “squeeze page” provides no links, no other navigation, and no context 
to the visitor. Google now frowns upon these pages, largely because they dis-
covered that their users hated them.
Online marketing strategist Sean D’Souza has crafted a Web site — www.
psychotactics.com — that still gets visitors’ names and e-mails without 
forcing anything. Here are his (and my) opinions about opt-in strategy:
Squeeze or No-Squeeze
Imagine you went for a date with a person you hadn’t met before. And your date 
wore a paper bag on his/her head. He/She refused to show you his/her face. 
That date refused to tell you anything about his/her past. Or let you into any 
information at all. Yet you had to give them information. Like your first name, 
last name, blah, blah, blah.
How do you feel?
Well that’s exactly how the customers feel. They feel irritated, frustrated, and to 
choose a mild word: trapped. They know they want the information, but they 
can’t seem to get any information from you without filling in that stupid form. 
Squeeze pages are contrary to human nature. They force you into a corner. They 
force you to part with information based on some random headline and bullet 
points.
So why do we have so many squeeze pages on the Internet? Why do people 
catch colds and coughs? Yes, one person has it, and then it spreads. One person 
put in a squeeze page, then everyone else decided to follow suit. Don’t get me 
wrong. Squeeze pages work. They work wonderfully.
Well, so does Bruno, who’s six foot nine inches and weighs 400 pounds. Just 
because it works doesn’t mean you have to follow suit. Because there are other 
things that work. Like non-threatening, non-Bruno, no-squeeze pages. Pages that 
get you to sign up not through intimidation and fear. But pages that get you to 
sign up because you want to do so. Because persuasion is stupid. Persuasion 
implies that you acted against your nature. And why get customers to act against 
their nature when they will gladly give you information?
A good opt-in page should entice. It should give you lots of details. It should 
answer your every question or objection. It should not make you feel icky, like 
being on a blind date.
At Psychotactics, we’ve collected names, addresses, home numbers, postal 
addresses, mobile numbers, city, country on our opt-in pages. All without twisting 
anyone’s arms. We’ve done it to entice customers to subscribe to the newsletter. 

217
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
Or to opt-in to a workshop. Or to buy a product or service. Our customers give us 
bucket loads of information, because they trust us. They believe in us. They know 
they’re not on a yucky blind date.
I’d rather have that kind of customer, wouldn’t you? Sure beats being squeezed!
Go to www.psychotactics.com and have a look around. And if you do 
subscribe (which I highly recommend), you’ll experience Sean’s noncoercive, 
warm and fuzzy opt-in process for yourself. (I can attest personally to the 
effectiveness of this method, as I use it on www.askhowie.com with great 
results.)
The folks at www.novamind.com sell mind-mapping software. The top goal of 
their Web site is to entice visitors to download the free 30-day trial version of 
the product. Because they know that visitors who try the software typically 
buy the software, they don’t even require an e-mail address.
If you can afford to spend real money on leads, you can collect snail mail 
addresses by offering a physical packet: a CD, a DVD, a book, a report, a 5-day 
supply of wrinkle cream, and such. E-mail is very cheap, but not very stable. 
A physical mailing address is not subject to spam filters or the whims of unre-
liable servers and switches. Also, the avalanche of spam e-mail that floods 
most people’s inboxes daily makes it hard for your legitimate sales messages 
to get the attention they deserve. The motto for e-mail could be, “When you 
absolutely, positively don’t really care if the message ever gets through.”
Getting permission to continue the relationship is such a fundamental goal 
that I devote all of Chapter 11 to the opt-in and e-mail follow-up.
Engaging visitors in real time
The opt-in allows you to follow up with your visitors by e-mail, in what online 
geeks refer to as an asynchronous fashion. This fancy word (asynchronous, not 
fashion) means there is a gap between when the message is created and when 
it is received. This book is an extreme example of asynchronous communica-
tion, as I’m writing it long before you will read it (unless you believe, based 
on my prescience and wisdom, that I am actually a time traveler from the 
year 2036 who came back to the first decade of the 21st century and couldn’t 
land a better gig than this book).
This form of communication fits well with the pie-in-the-sky dream of the 
Internet as a business medium where you never have to deal with customers: 
You just create a Web site, write a bunch of e-mails that are sent automati-
cally, and check your inbox for incoming orders. That strategy can work, to 
a degree, but everyone I’ve worked with has found that adding real-time, live 
engagement to their Web site boosts sales significantly.

The telephone is a much underused online marketing tool. Get a toll-free 
phone number, place it prominently on your Web site next to the calling 
hours (“24 hours a day, 7 days a week” is a good policy), and offer them a 
reason to call. Figure 10-4 graces the top of the www.unlockthegame.com 
home page, while Figure 10-5 appears at the top of the www.mywedding

Selling the Most Desirable Action
After you define your sales process, your next big question is, “What stands 
between customers and the next step?” If you want them to download your 
free report, what do they need to be feeling and thinking in order to go ahead 
and do it? If you want them to call, what might cause them to hesitate and 
then bail? If you’re asking for the sale, what action-freezing second thoughts 
might they be entertaining?
A cliché in the sales world is that you have to work as hard to sell a $10 item 
as a $10 million item. On the Internet, you have to work just about as hard to 
give something away free. Your landing pages must answer your prospects’ 
questions, reassure their doubts, assuage their fears, and guide them clearly 
to what they should do next.
I have an entire library filled with books and manuals dedicated to the cre-
ation of effective sales copy. The masters of persuasive copy know a lot of 
tricks and techniques, but the basis for their effectiveness is a deep knowl-
edge of what their prospects want to have and want to avoid. As you can 
read in Chapter 4, marketing tricks without having your finger on the pulse 
of a substantial market is like doing a technically perfect triple gainer into 
an empty swimming pool. So the following copywriting tasks can be accom-
plished effectively only against the backdrop of market insight.

219
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
Using bullets
Sales bullets are the foundation for all effective sales copy, whether they 
appear in actual bullet form on the page or not. Ken McCarthy, my copywrit-
ing teacher, gave me a very useful phrase to focus on whenever I sit down to 
write sales copy: Bullets Wound. (Wound here rhymes with swooned.) In other 
words, the purpose of the bullet is to highlight and stretch the gap in your 
visitor’s mind between their current and ideal situations. The cure for the

Translating features into benefits
As sellers, we become intimately acquainted with the facts of our products 
and services. It glows in the dark; it comes in extra large; it has a self-cleaning 
button; it’s made from shea butter; and so on. After a while, we are in danger 
of operating under the illusion that our prospects understand why these 
features are important and beneficial. They don’t have a clue, and if we fail 
to translate features into benefits, then we are asking our prospects to do 
interpretive work they have no interest in doing.

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Here’s a quick formula for figuring whether a particular statement is a feature 
or a benefit. Write down the statement. Look at it. Ask yourself whether your 
most impolite and brash customer could conceivably read it and snarl, “So 
what?” If so, you’ve got yourself a feature, not a benefit.
To turn a feature into a benefit, write down the feature, add the words “. . . 
and what this means to you is . . .” and then complete the sentence. Ken 
McCarthy thinks of this as “bringing the facts to life.” For example, one of my 
clients, poly-D, is a company that manufactures a metered dispensing system 
(MDS) for household, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications. Isn’t that 
exciting?
Actually, the technology is exciting. But calling the feature a “metered dis-
pensing system” asks the prospects — for example, brand managers in 
charge of cleaning products, toiletries, and food and beverage lines — to do 
way too much work.
The first pass at turning a feature into a benefit often creates not a true ben-
efit, but a clearer feature set. For example, the MDS uses a button-operated 
vacuum pump to dispense the liquid, gel, or ointment it contains.
It’s the job of the product marketer to bring each of these features to life. 
The fact that MDS dispenses a product via a button-operated vacuum pump 
means the product
 
✓ Can be dispensed one-handed
 
✓ Gives a consistent dose
 
✓ Eliminates leaks and spills
 
✓ Gets 98 percent of the liquid, gel, or ointment out of the package
Each of those features can become a benefit:
 
✓ One-handed dispensing: Tired parents can hold a sick, thrashing tod-
dler in one arm and pour the medicine into a cup with the other.
 
✓ Consistent dose: The tired parents don’t have to worry about finding a 
measuring spoon or misreading the dosing directions.
 
✓ No leaks or spills: The tired parents don’t end up with cough syrup run-
ning down their pajama tops or oozing between their toes into the shag 
carpet.
 
✓ 98 percent product evacuation: The tired parents don’t have to hold 
the cough syrup upside down for five minutes, waiting for the final drips 
to exit the bottle. No waste — they get to use what they’ve paid for.
The sales material we created for poly-D brings the features of the MDS to 
life for the brand managers, as well as for the end user. We didn’t assume the 
brand managers could translate the experience of a tired parent with a sick 

221
 Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site
kid into a benefit relevant to them, so we did it for them. In the white paper 
available at www.poly-d.com, we explain that the MDS instantly gives their 
existing products a new and dramatically different marketing story. We help 
them see how effective their advertising campaigns could be, with a real 
consumer benefit to tout. Make sure your benefits relate directly to what you 
know or believe your prospects want. Your goal is to help your prospects 
visualize the movie of their future, a future made rosy by the action they’re 
about to take.
Provoking curiosity
If the next action involves education of your prospects, you have to whet their 
appetites for the information you have and they don’t. Bullets that provoke 
curiosity include teasers (“The most dangerous seat on an airplane — page 5”), 
hidden information (“Best-kept secret in the travel industry”), promise of 
valuable knowledge (“How to spot slot machines that pay off most often”), 
warnings (“Surprise! Choosing the wrong private school for your child can cost 
you a bundle in tax breaks”), and questions (“Would you know how to keep 
your ticket safe if you won the lottery?”).
Useful But Incomplete: If I wanted you to go to askhowie.com/loms and 
read the entire sales letter, I would tease you with a partial list in Figure 10-6 
and imply that the really good stuff is just behind the curtain, waiting for 
your visit.
Including third-party testimonials
For several reasons, third-party testimonials can sell more powerfully than 
you can. They can pull off this bit of magic because they are
 
✓ Believable: Your visitors have (unfortunately) been taught many times 
that salespeople will lie through their teeth to make a sale. Until you 
prove otherwise, you’re presumed to be in that category. Your custom-
ers who say nice things about you don’t have anything to gain by lying. 
On the contrary, they’re risking their own “credibility capital” by going 
out on a limb and endorsing you.
 
✓ Polite: Grandma said that it’s impolite to brag. If you can get your satis-
fied customers to do it for you, you can look bashfully pleased instead of 
boastful — while still getting your message across.
 
✓ Benefit-based: Testimonials are already formulated to highlight benefits 
because customers create them rather than you.
You can deploy four testimonial media on your landing page: video, audio, 
written text, and contact for more information. Video can be extremely effec-
tive if done well, but tends to be expensive, time-consuming, and a pain for 
your customers to give you. Ken McCarthy uses video testimonials effectively 

222
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
at the www.thesystemseminar.org sales page. Because all his customers 
were in one place — his seminar — it was cost-effective to hire a video crew 
and collect the testimonials.
 
Audio testimonials can be almost as powerful, and are much less expensive 
and time-consuming to produce. You can collect audio testimonials just by 
asking your customers to pick up a telephone and talk. Try it now: Call (214) 
615-6505, extension 6900 and say something nice about this book. I may post 
your comment at www.askhowie.com/readercomments. You have to pay 
long-distance charges (because I’m a cheapskate), but you can set up a toll-free 
audio line for just a few dollars a month. Visit www.askhowie.com/audio for 
recommended services and advanced testimonial-gathering strategies. 
Written testimonials by themselves are the least powerful, simply because 
you might have written them yourself. But by adding the written text below 
an audio or video, you can have the best of both worlds: believability and 
multiple modes of message delivery.
Finally, you can let your visitors know you have “references available upon 
request.” This can work for big purchases later in the sales cycle; on the land-
ing page, focus on delivering needed information immediately.
Giving clear instructions 
in the call to action
Somebody once said, “A confused mind always says ‘no.’” In fact, if you’re 
reading this book out loud, you just said it. Make sure your instructions for 
the action you want visitors to take are so clear and free of ambiguity that a 
reasonably intelligent hamster could follow them.
Not only will you explain exactly how to fill out the form, where the form is 
located, and what to click, but you will also tell them what happens next. 
What page will be served after they click “Send me the two free chapters!”? 
What will appear in their inboxes and in what time frame? Do they need to 
add you to their spam filters’ white lists? If they phone you, who will answer? 
What extension should they ask for?
Tony Robbins likes to say that humans have a simultaneous need for cer-
tainty and excitement — a balance between what is known and what is 
unknown. At the point where someone is considering entering into a rela-
tionship with your Web site, your job is to reduce the already considerable 
uncertainty.

I
ndulge me for a moment and try this experiment. Think about the Web 
sites you browsed yesterday (or the most recent day you were online). 
Roughly, how many sites were there? What were they? Take a minute and 
write down as many as you can remember. When you’re done, open your Web 
browser and view your browsing history. How many sites did you forget? 
How many of those sites are you likely ever to visit again?
The point of this experiment: If you’re anything like me, you visited a lot of 
sites, found some of them interesting, but got distracted and left without leav-
ing yourself a convenient and reliable way back. Your Web site visitors are 
the same. You work like crazy to build a great AdWords campaign, pay real 
money for visitors, and most of them vanish like dust in the wind (to quote 
one of my favorite folk-rock songs of the 1970s).
You haven’t bored your Web site’s visitors, or offended them, or disqualified 
them. They just weren’t ready to transact business with you at that moment. 
Or a phone call, incoming e-mail sound, fax, co-worker, daydream, flashback, 
or UFO sighting distracted them. What a shame, too. You spend so much 
time, money, and energy to get them into a sales funnel that turns out to 
operate more like a sieve.
In this chapter, I show you some strategies and tools for following up with 
prospects after they leave your Web site. You discover easy methods for 
deploying effective follow-up sequences that you create once and put on

autopilot. You see how to use e-mail autoresponders and newsletters to 
become your prospect’s one and only. And you integrate telephone and mail 
strategies to keep your business on the radar screen.
Overcoming Your Prospects’ Miniscule 
Online Attention Span
Your average Web site visitor has the attention span of a guppy — deal with 
it. Online attention spans are notoriously short, but merchants have known 
for a long time that a sale delayed is generally a sale lost. The infomercial 
must get a couch potato to the phone, credit card in hand, before the thumb 
touches the TV remote. The direct mail subscription pitch must compel 
action before the reader puts the letter down to grab a cold drink from the 
kitchen because soon that letter will be in the middle of a pile, instead of 
at the top. And the salesperson at the car dealership wants the prospect to 
commit today, before comparison-shopping a better deal in the next county.
Pressure tactics don’t work online
The traditional sales approach to any sort of buyer hesitation and reluctance 
has been to wrestle prospects to the ground, lock them into a half nelson (full 
nelsons prevent them from signing the credit card slip), and shove a vacuum 
cleaner hose into their pocket or purse and suck out the money. In the offline 
world, this translates into pressure tactics, fake scarcity, fake urgency, aggres-
sively overcoming objections, and various sleazy tricks. Salespeople are 
taught that, “I’ll think about it” means “No, and you can kiss your commission 
goodbye.”
That attitude is crazy. Sure, prospects lie to avoid conflict and to keep from 
hurting our feelings. But sometimes prospects are telling the truth when they 
say they need to think it over. If they are forced into a decision before they’re 
ready, the decision will almost certainly be no. If the high-pressure tactics 
work, the buyer’s remorse refund rate will be astronomical. Moreover, those 
customers will not be sources of referral business because they want to pro-
tect their friends from unpleasant experiences.
I could debate the relative effectiveness of these tactics in the face-to-face 
world, but it’s clear that they don’t work so well on the Internet. Don’t like a 
Web site? It’s gone at the click of a button, no hard feelings. Give yourself a 
reality check about online manners and inhibitions by visiting a Yahoo! chat 
group some time. Perfectly mild-mannered folks who wouldn’t dream of so 

225
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
much as coughing if someone cut in front of them in the supermarket line 
turn into raving lunatics online, slinging mud and brimstone safe in the shel-
ter of their anonymity. Trust me: The second your visitor is annoyed by your 
site, he or she disappears faster than Roadrunner in a cloud of smoke. (Insert 
your own sound effects.)
Build a relationship so you can make the 
sale when your prospect is ready to buy
Your mission, should you choose to run a successful online venture, is fourfold:
 
✓ Get your prospects’ contact information. You want their e-mail at the 
very least, more if you can get it. The more you ask for, the fewer pros-
pects will convert to leads (I define a lead as someone you can follow up 
with), and the more serious they will be.
 
✓ Receive their explicit permission to stay in touch. People don’t always 
realize that you will be using their contact information to contact them, 
probably because it occurs so rarely in the offline world. Prospects are 
used to dropping their business cards into a fishbowl for a chance to 
win dinner for four, or giving the supermarket all their contact informa-
tion in exchange for a loyalty card, and never hearing a peep after that. 
If you assume that an e-mail address represents an open invitation to 
visit their inbox, you’ll be rudely awakened faster than they can hit the 
Report Spam button in their e-mail program. Enough spam complaints 
and your Web site is basically out of business.
 
✓ Provide such helpful and credible advice, guidance, and support 
that your visitors never ever go searching on that topic again. Perry 
Marshall refers to this as “taking your prospect off the market.” When 
prospects are actively searching for information, they go wide, look-
ing at a lot of sites and getting the lay of the land. They don’t want to 
become the world expert; they’re just looking for someone to trust, 
to hold their hand and lead them. Your follow-up will determine if you 
become that trusted resource or not.
 
✓ Build a relationship that leads naturally to a win-win outcome. 
Database marketing consultant Lori Feldman (www.thedatabasediva.
com) reminds us, “The purpose of a business is to grow a customer.” 
Not just to get the sale. A sale is a one-time transaction. A customer is a 
living, breathing asset. The relationship you build with leads may lead to 
sales, referrals of their friends, testimonials, and more. But the goal of the 
relationship is not to close the deal, but to determine if a sale is a win-win 
outcome or not. The most expensive customers in your database are the 
ones you shouldn’t be selling to. They take up too much time, demand 
too much special help, and don’t buy anything else from you.

226
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Spinning a Web with an Opt-In
In Chapter 10, I identify the opt-in as one of the top goals of any landing page. 
An opt-in refers to a prospect who has opted into your database with the 
expectation of receiving follow-up communications from you. Depending on 
the market, the quality of traffic to your landing page, your offer, and how 
you describe that offer, you can aim for an opt-in rate from 20–50 percent, 
sometimes higher. If your opt-in rate is lower than 20 percent, you’re doing 
something wrong. This chapter helps you fix your opt-in process.
Unlike a spider that spins a web to ensnare — and subsequently eat — its 
prey, you spin a customer-catching Web site to ensure a second date with 
your prospects. The opt-in takes all the pressure off the first visit. They can 
buy if they like, but, hey, no big deal if they don’t. If your Web site has to 
make the sale on the first visit, your prose is likely to come across as desper-
ate. And desperate is not attractive, not at junior high school dances, and not 
in sales. The more desperate you seem, the more it looks like there’s some-
thing wrong with you.
The most common method of acquiring an opt-in is through a form on 
your Web site. Figure 11-1 shows a form that I use on www.askhowie.com 
to get visitors to download my AdWords ER Report, “Why Most AdWords 
Campaigns Fail, and How to Make Yours Succeed.” Opt-in forms can also be 
embedded into sales copy, as I do in the body of the www.askhowie.com 
home page. (Notice that the entire function of this page is to get the visitor to 
subscribe — even the testimonials refer specifically to the ER Report and the 
BOPzine (Breakthrough Online Profits e-zine) that they get in exchange for 
their e-mail address.)

227
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
 
Whatever e-mail service you use to send e-mails and manage your list will help 
you generate the HTML code or JavaScript that puts the form on your Web 
site. Later in this chapter, I show you the vendor I use and recommend a few 
others for comparison.
 
If you thought you could do e-mail marketing using Outlook Express or Yahoo 
Mail, you were mistaken. If you have more than 20 leads in your database, you 
will need a specialized application to get the e-mails out, manage your list in 
accordance with anti-spam rules, and keep your sanity.
Generating an opt-in form using AWeber
For the purposes of this chapter, I’m going to use my preferred vendor, 
AWeber Communications, to show you how to set up and manage e-mail fol-
low-up. If you already have a shopping cart with e-mail capabilities, you will 
have to adapt the instructions accordingly. If you don’t yet have an e-mail-
marketing provider, sign up for an account at www.aweber.com. (For a video 
tutorial and overview of the e-mail marketing process, visit www.askhowie.
com/email first.) Currently, AWeber costs $19 per month for the first 500 
subscribers. Just to put this cost in perspective, you can now send unlimited 
e-mails to up to 500 people at a time, as many times as you want. If you give 
$19 to the U.S. Postal Service, you can buy 43 first-class stamps and still have 
eight cents left over for envelopes and paper. (That’s as of summer 2009, so 
you’ll have to do the math yourself when rates rise again.)
 
Before you build the opt-in form, you need a place to send your visitors after 
they complete the form. This page should confirm the success of their opt-in 
(“Thank you for signing up for the Nose Hair Removal Secrets 42-Day E-mail 
Course”), describe what they’ll be receiving next and where and when to look 
for it (“Check your e-mail inbox in about 5 minutes for Installment 1: Don’t Use 
a Butane Lighter While Waiting at a Gas Station”), and suggest a next action 
(“While you’re waiting, let me tell you about an amazing new way to remove 
nasal hair without tweezers, dry ice, or gas flames . . . ”). Don’t worry about 
getting it perfect — for our purposes right now, all you need is a working URL 
to send your lead. Name the page something like www.yoursite.com/
signupthanks.html and remember the name.
When the thank-you page is done, you’re ready to sign up for an AWeber 
account as follows:
 
1. Go to www.aweber.com and click the Order button at the top.
 
 Choose any plan you like, from one month to a full year — you get 30 
days during which you can get a full refund. If you like it, the annual plan 
is the best value; e-mail marketing is a long-term tool.
 
2. After placing your order, you’re taken to a page with a link to log in to 
the Control Panel. Click that link.

228
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
 
 AWeber immediately sends you an e-mail with your login and password.
 
3. Enter your new login and password, click Account at the top right, 
and change your password to something you’ll remember.
 
4. Return to the Home page and click the Getting Started — Setup Guide 
link.
 
5. Choose Web Form Wizard to create your first opt-in form.
 
6. On the next page, click the green Create Web Form button in the 
center of the page and fill out the form details (see Figure 11-2).
 
7. In the Form Name text box, enter a name for your form that you’ll 
remember later.
 
 Only you see the form name, so don’t worry about being clever. Just 
describe it so you can find it later among the many forms you’ll create.
 
8. Select the type of form you’re using.
 
 The form type can be in-line (that is, within the Web page itself), or a 
pop-up, pop-under, or pop-over/hover. Google won’t let you use pop-
ups, exit pops, or pop-unders on a landing page, and they really annoy 
people, so forget about those options. The pop-over/hover isn’t actually 
a pop-up; instead, it’s a graphic that’s technically part of your Web page 
even though it appears to float above it. Google has mixed feelings about 
this; sometimes it disables your ads if they point to pages with pop-
overs, and sometimes it doesn’t. Stick with an in-line form for now.
 
9. Enter a URL that you created for your “Thank you for opting in” page 
in the Thank You Page text box.
 
 The page must exist already, or else AWeber gets persnickety. If you 
don’t have a thank you page ready, either enter your home page for now, 
or leave the AWeber default page. Just don’t forget to come back and 
change it later. I talk about strategies for this page later in this chapter.
 
10. As the instructions say, leave the Forward Variables check box blank 
if you don’t know what it means.
 
 Later on, you can use this feature to customize the thank-you page, just 
as you can do with PHP on the landing page (see Chapter 10).
 
11. (Optional) Enable ad tracking by entering some unique description for 
this form in the Ad Tracking text box.
 
 You can use ad tracking to segment your list based on the particular 
form your lead used to opt in. This ability to segment comes in handy, 
say, if each ad group leads to a different landing page. You can name the 
traffic source or the page in the Ad Tracking field so you can find all the 
leads who were interested in red wagons as opposed to green tricycles. 
If you place a form more than once on the same page (at the top of the 
right sidebar and below the landing page text, for example), you can 
even track which form collected the opt-in.

12. Leave the Start on Message drop-down list at the default for now: 
(Default) 1 Autoresponse.
 
 An autoresponse is an automatic e-mail that your leads get from you. The 
default setting means they’ll receive all the autoresponse e-mails in the 
sequence, starting with the first one.
 
13. Click Next to design the form:
 
 The instructions for this part are pretty straightforward on the AWeber 
site:
 
a. If you hover your mouse pointer over the Name field on the left, 
you see a plus sign. Click it to add that field to your form.
 
b. Just below the Name field, you can click the Add New Field link to 
add more fields if you want to collect a visitor’s address, phone 
number, pet’s name, favorite flavor of Vice Cream, annual income, 
innie or outie belly button, and so on.
 
c. When you add a new field, you see a check box labeled Subscriber 
Update. Check this box if you want your lead to be able to change 
this information later.

230
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
 
d. You can change the order of the fields by clicking and dragging 
them up or down. Edit a field by holding your mouse over it and 
clicking the pencil icon. Four options appear to the left:
 
 Required: Does your prospect have to fill out this field to opt in, or 
is it optional?
 
 Type of Field: In addition to plain text, you can include drop-down 
lists and radio buttons for multiple choice questions, check boxes 
for yes/no, and a larger text area to give the prospect the visual 
cue that they can write a short novel here.
 
 Label and Default Value: The Label text box is used in conjunction 
with the Default Value field (see the following) to segment your list 
later. For example, if you put this form on your Juggling Scarves for 
Kids page, you can include a hidden field called Product and make 
the default value Jr. Juggling Scarves. Later, you can search for this 
value and send a scarf coupon to people on your list who opted in 
from this page and haven’t yet bought the scarves (see Figure 11-3).

 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
 
14. (Optional) Click the Submit button at the bottom of the form to 
rename it.
 
 I generally give the button a title that sounds like my prospect making a 
request: “Send Me the Action Guide!”
 
15. When you finish editing the form, click the Save button (bottom right), 
and you’re ready to get the code for your opt-in page.
Placing the form on your Web site
After you create your Web form on the AWeber site, you need to get the code 
that you’ll place in your opt-in Web page. In the AWeber List Settings tab, 
select Web Form from the submenu. If you’ve created your first form, you’ll 
see it in the list. Click Preview to see what the form looks like by itself. If 
everything is in the right order and you’re ready to stick it on a page in your 
site, close the pop-up window and select Get HTML.
AWeber gives you a new window with two code options. The top one, shown 
in Figure 11-4, is in JavaScript, and consists of a single line of code that you 
place on your page’s HTML where you want the form to appear. The script 
goes to AWeber’s Web site and pulls the form onto your page. As long as you 
don’t need to change the look and feel of the form, this is a good option. It 
allows you to collect statistics on how many times the form was displayed, 
which you need to determine your opt-in rate.
 
Figure 11-4:

form with-
out making 
design 
changes, 
add this 
snippet of 
code to your 
Web page.
 

232
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
If you want more control over the design of the form, select and copy the raw 
HTML code from the lower box. Your Web designer can use this code to make 
the opt-in form blend in with the rest of your page. You can see an example of 
a designed AWeber opt-in form; visit www.poly-d.com and click through to 
the white paper offer.
 
Visit www.askhowie.com/forms to see examples of both codes.
Generating opt-ins via e-mail
You can also generate opt-ins via e-mail. For example, if you send a blank 
e-mail to askhowie@aweber.com, within about a minute you’ll get an e-mail 
with the subject line, “RESPONSE REQUIRED: Confirm your request for infor-
mation from askhowie” or something like that. When you click the first link 
within that e-mail, you’re added to my list and will start receiving my e-mail 
messages. (See the following section for a discussion of this double opt-in 
process.)
Importing and adding leads yourself
AWeber and most other e-mail marketing services allow you to import exist-
ing lists and add new leads manually as well. The better services — the ones 
you want to use — send all these prospects a RESPONSE REQUIRED type of 
e-mail to make sure they want to receive your messages. It’s a pain, but if 
your service doesn’t require this, I predict that a lot of your e-mail messages 
will not make it through the spam filters. It’s counterintuitive, but I won’t use 
a service that doesn’t verify my imported lists.
 
You and I are honest and ethical, of course, and would never send out thou-
sands of spam messages to people who don’t want them. But if the e-mail ser-
vice I use allows other people to do just that, the spam filters will catch my 
e-mails as well as those of the spammers, because they are all being sent from 
the same server. Using a lax e-mail service is like putting the return address 
Seedytown on your envelopes. Don’t risk it.
How to “Bribe” Your Prospects to Opt In
The mechanics of the opt-in are straightforward: Place a form on your site, 
tell people to fill it out, send them to a thank-you page, and start e-mailing. 
The only thing missing is the answer to your prospect’s question, “Why on 
earth should I give you my name and contact information?” People protect 

233
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
their inboxes like geese protecting their nests. The last thing they want is a 
bunch of annoying e-mails trying to sell them something. The keys to achiev-
ing a high opt-in rate are to
 
✓ Give away something of value.
 
✓ Make the opt-in in a logical next step in the relationship rather than a 
form of online extortion.
 
✓ Offer your visitors something they really want.
 
✓ Reassure them.
Give away something of value
When I was little, my dad used to take me to Sonny Amster’s bakery on 
Vauxhall Road in Millburn on Sunday mornings to get rolls and bagels for 
brunch. My most vivid memories of those trips were the hundreds of free 
cookies I consumed. Mr. Amster understood the power of giving away a free 
sample before asking for the sale. He knew that if he could give away some-
thing of value before asking for the sale, he was likely to ring up a bigger 
order than if he insisted on payment before the munching began.
Not only did my dad sometimes add a dozen cookies to our order, he felt 
compelled to buy as an act of reciprocity. As Robert Cialdini explains in his 
book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (published by Collins), when 
someone does something nice for us, we feel a powerful urge to balance 
the scales by doing something nice in return. This principle is often used to 
manipulate us, but works even better when it’s genuine.
 
You can give away something of value as a prequel to the opt-in. If you sell uni-
cycles and generate traffic with a Unicycle Beginners ad group, give away a 
free guide on the seven steps to learning to ride. Put Steps 1 and 2 right on the 
landing page, and offer the remaining five steps in an e-mail. Make the first half 
of an article about choosing your first unicycle available on your site, and ask 
for an e-mail address to send them the second half. Put a video on your site 
showing the first step, and offer a series of how-to-ride videos in exchange for 
the opt-in.
Make the opt-in a logical next step
To grasp the concept of a logical next step, return with me to the metaphor 
of the museum where people go to find the love of their life. You’re standing 
next to an attractive person whom you’d like to know better, looking at the 
postmodern painting of a 12-foot-high piece of lined notebook paper. The 

234
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
person glances in your direction, smiles, and says something like, “I wonder 
what music the artist was listening to while she was painting this.” You say, 
“I’ll tell you what I think if you give me your e-mail address.” End of conversa-
tion, no?
The request for their e-mail address had nothing to do with the prior conver-
sation. On your Web site, your opt-in will not work if it’s just a thinly veiled 
attempt to build your list.
If you need inspiration, consider the tech-support hotline model. Have you 
ever waited on hold for 20 minutes for tech support, listening to cheesy 
music or endless repetitions of “Your call is important to us, and we will 
answer your call in the order it was received”? And then you get a live 
person, start explaining the problem, and 30 seconds later you hear a click 
and a busy signal? After years of this treatment, I finally got a technician who 
began the call by asking for my phone number and e-mail address “in case we 
get disconnected.” Boy, was I ever so happy to give away my information. I 
received a logical reason to share that information, so I did.
Why do you need your visitors’ e-mail addresses? What are you going to send 
them via e-mail? Why do they want it? If you ask for a phone number, how will 
they benefit from your call? Spell it out: “Leave your phone number if you’d 
like to talk about which perennials will thrive in your garden.”
 
I asked Seth Godin (www.sethgodin.com), author of the very important 
book, Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers into Friends and Friends into 
Customers (Simon & Schuster), his thoughts about trying to compel your visi-
tors to opt in because you’re trying to build your list. Seth didn’t beat around 
the bush:
What you want is irrelevant. Of course, it matters what you want if you have 
power, if you can force people to do what you want. The reality is that the 
new paradigm demands humility. You will either engage people on their 
terms or you will fail to engage them. Your choice.
Offer your visitors something 
they really want
Every marketing campaign consists of three factors:
 
✓ The market: In the case of your AdWords landing page, the market is ini-
tially determined by the keyword and then funneled through your ad.
 
✓ The creative: This is everything you show your market to get them to 
accept your offer — text, graphics, audio, video, and so on.
 
✓ The offer: This is the bait, the thing they really want.

235
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
Marketers like to spend a lot of time massaging the creative part because it’s 
fun and they have the most control over it. But the success (95 percent of it, 
anyway) of your campaigns depends on one thing: how well the offer matches 
the market. In other words, is this bait something your visitors want?
In dating, someone gives you their phone number for one reason only: they’re 
hoping you give them a call some time. Your job is to become so appealing 
that your prospects actually want to hear from you again. They look forward 
to your e-mails. They get value (and perhaps entertainment) from every point 
of contact.
You already know what your AdWords traffic wants because they told you 
by clicking your ad. You can use the ad to split-test features of your offer 
(free report, e-mail course, PDF delivered by e-mail, fax, small lead-lined box 
flown to your door by 72 carrier pigeons, whatever). See Chapter 13 for the 
details of split-testing, and read the later section, “Creating a lead-generating 
magnet,” for a discussion of types of things you can offer in exchange for 
your visitors’ contact information.
Reassure your visitors
Basically, three things motivate human beings: seeking pleasure, avoiding 
pain, and conserving energy. Of the three, pain avoidance is usually the 
strongest. Most of the time we’re just acting out of damage control, asking 
ourselves, “What’s the worst that can happen here and how can I prevent it?” 
At the threshold of opting in, prospects want to be reassured that you won’t 
spam them; that they can stop the flow of e-mails easily at any time; and that 
you’ll respect their privacy and not sell, rent, barter, or give away their con-
tact information to anyone else.
Legendary copywriter Gary Bencivenga puts the following sentence below 
his www.bencivengabullets.com opt-in form: “No obligation . . . Nothing 
to buy . . . Your e-mail address will never be shared or rented.”
To sell or to get the opt-in?
When I present the opt-in strategy to clients, they sometimes object on the 
grounds that the opt-in strategy will get in the way of the main objective of 
the site: the sale. They understand the sales funnel, and worry that a side-
ways step will upset the process and destroy sales.
A sale is a fragile thing, and you can certainly sabotage your sales by creat-
ing a clumsy opt-in process. And you’ll get fewer initial sales if you go for the 
opt-in first, rather than the sale. But if your sales conversion of a new visitor 
is 0.5 percent (meaning 1 out of every 200 visitors buys from you) and your 

236
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
opt-in percentage is 20 percent (meaning 1 out of five visitors opts-in to your 
list), you will almost certainly make more sales from ongoing follow-up than 
from the one-shot approach.
If your prospect wants to buy right now, don’t put an opt-in in their way. 
Online sales include all the information you could ask for, including the lovely 
credit card number and expiration date. Consider the sale a super opt-in.
 
Make sure your thank-you page offers a path back to the sales funnel, rather 
than a dead end.
The thank-you page
Perry Marshall uses two clever techniques on his thank-you pages to keep 
the sales process going while the prospect is still hot. You can see his thank-
you page by opting in to his five-day AdWords e-mail course at www.perrys
marshall.com. Even though the first autoresponse e-mail actually hits your 
inbox within 30 seconds of clicking Start Your Mini-Course Now, Perry tells 
you to check your inbox “in about 10 minutes.”
The second technique in use on this page is the dynamic redirect. The page 
tells the visitor, “In a few seconds, I’m going to tell you about the latest 
tools for making the most of Google. . . .” And the page is coded to send you 
straight to a sales letter about 15 seconds after it first appears.
Here’s the code, which you place between the <HEAD> and </HEAD> tags in 
the page’s HTML code:
<meta HTTP-EQUIV=”REFRESH” content=”0; url=http://
www.yourdomain.com/nextpage.html”>
Replace the two elements in bold. Instead of 0, put in the number of seconds 
you want this page to show before redirecting. Replace the example URL with 
the next page.
The thank-you page is also a great place to explain to your leads what to 
expect from you next, and what they have to do to get it. When you download 
the two free chapters from Leads into Gold at www.leadsintogold.com, 
you’re taken to a download page that includes the download link and instruc-
tions on downloading the chapters in PDF format.
It also includes a mini-sales pitch for the autoresponder sequence you just 
signed up for (and may not have known about):

237
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
Important Note: I’ll be sending you a series of e-mail tips to help you get the 
most out of the two free chapters. They have incredibly valuable insights, 
and a lot of subscribers think I’m crazy for giving it away for nothing.
I’ve always been a show-off — just ask my sister.
Here’s the thing: Your ISP’s spam filter may consider these e-mails to be 
spam, and will prevent you from reading them.
To ensure you receive the e-mails (you can unsubscribe at any time), please 
add me to your trusted list of senders. Here’s how . . .
Notice that I put the download link right on the thank-you page. That strategy 
raises an interesting question: Do I care if someone can get to that page by 
giving me a fake e-mail address? If I put the link in an e-mail, I know that the 
e-mail must be real for them to get the two free chapters. In this case, I want 
to get the two free chapters into as many hands as possible, because those 
chapters do such a good job of selling the rest of the product. If you follow 
up with leads manually, or don’t want your lead-generating magnet available 
except to your subscriber list, then don’t put the link on the thank-you page.
 
To see an example of this without having to opt in to a list, visit www.ask
howie.com/redirect and wait 12 seconds.
Creating a lead-generating magnet
You have many choices about what sort of lead-generating magnet (LGM) to 
create. You can offer information, a free sample, a demo version, a limited 
time free trial, or a coupon. If your Web site is a catalog store with many 
items available for purchase, the LGM can be as simple as an invitation to 
receive a 5 percent discount off the first purchase. Software vendors can offer 
demo versions, either time-limited or with features disabled.
If you sell high-margin consumables — such as skin care products, health 
supplements, and perfumes — you may find a free trial to be a cost-effective 
way to build your customer list. Free or low-cost trials also work with high-
margin intangibles, such as membership Web sites and newsletter subscrip-
tions. I offer a low-cost one-month trial of my Ring of Fire AdWords support 
club, because one month gives my prospects a chance to experience the ben-
efits without commitment or fear of making a mistake. Many of them sign up 
for a full year after their trial month.

238
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Informational LGMs
The economics of the Internet favor giving away information. After you create 
the LGM, digital copies are all free, so you incur no marginal expense by 
giving away a million as opposed to a hundred. When your business includes 
a healthy back end, you can afford to pay more up front to mail letters and 
packages.
Formats
Informational LGMs can take many formats:
 
✓ Free Report/White Paper (PDF)
 
✓ Newsletter (PDF, Web page, e-mail)
 
✓ Book (self-published)
 
✓ Magazine/Journal
 
✓ Resource Guide
 
✓ Analysis/Planning Template
 
✓ Electronic Book
 
✓ Recorded Message
 
✓ CD/DVD
 
✓ Preloaded iPod/mp3 player
 
✓ Restricted Access Website
 
✓ Audio/Video download
 
✓ E-mail Course
 
✓ Live Seminar/Workshop
 
✓ “Cheat Sheet”
Content types
Three basic types of information LGMs lend themselves very well to the pur-
poses of attracting, building trust, and selling. These are special reports, con-
sumer guides, and how-to guides.
 
✓ Special Report (often called White Paper in the corporate world): The 
free report is the tool of choice when your prospect is not yet educated 
or motivated enough to take action of any kind. The free report essen-
tially names a problem faced by your prospects, gets them emotionally 
involved in the horrible consequences of the problem, unveils a generic 
solution, and then introduces and sells your version of the solution.

239
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
 
 By contrast, the Consumer Guide (see the following bullet) works better 
when the prospects know they have a problem, know they need to solve 
it, and are looking at you and your competitors side by side.
 
 Visit www.askhowie.com/reports for examples of a special report for 
consumers (by an indoor air specialist writing to parents of children 
with asthma) and a business-to-business white paper (about maximizing 
profits from your customer list).
 
✓ Consumer Guide: The consumer guide is most effective when your 
prospect is actively shopping for a solution and trying to figure out 
which solution to buy. A variation is the Consumer Alert, which warns 
prospects about all the ways they can be scammed or make a wrong 
decision. A popular format for this is the “Seven questions to ask before 
choosing a. . . .” You name your profession, and teach your prospect 
how to find a qualified and honest practitioner.
 
✓ How-to Guide: The How-To Guide doesn’t have to refer to your prod-
uct at all. What it does is teach your prospects how to solve a problem 
somewhat related to the problem that your product solves.
 
 For example, if you sell bookkeeping services for small businesses, 
your prospects typically have grown to the point where they are over-
whelmed by the amount of start-up stuff they haven’t outsourced or 
hired for. Think about what other problems owners of growing small 
businesses have: inefficient purchasing systems, not enough time to 
market and sell, nagging questions about incorporation options, and so 
on. If you can offer information that solves those problems, you can be 
pretty sure that the people who raise their hands in interest are good 
prospects for you as well.
 
 If you need to bid on turn-the-corner keywords, create a How-To Guide 
that qualifies your prospects and gets them into your funnel, even if it 
doesn’t directly sell your products or services. You now have the ability 
to build the relationship through the most revolutionary communica-
tions medium of the last 50 years: e-mail.
Staying on Your Prospects’ 
Minds with E-mail
Imagine for a moment that Google changes its policies and bans all your ads. 
Imagine further that it changes its search algorithm, thereby excluding your 
Web pages from its listings. What would happen to your online business?

240
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Aside from pointing out the foolishness of putting all your business eggs into 
one Google basket, the scenario I just described points out the importance of 
having a customer list. As Fred Astaire sang to Ginger Rogers on a ferry deck 
in Shall We Dance, “They can’t take that away from me.”
As Ken McCarthy says, one goal of your list is to support your business if all 
your traffic disappears. The glue that binds your list to you is e-mail. In spite 
of all the spam, a person’s e-mail inbox is an intimate space. Think of how 
much more upset people get about spam than junk mail to appreciate just 
how intimate we want it to be. Writing e-mails that grow the relationship is 
one of the most important skills you need to succeed online.
You can send two kinds of e-mail: autoresponses and broadcasts. They serve 
different purposes, and can complement each other to create a powerful 
e-mail customer-building strategy. Before I cover these methods, I want to 
discuss a much-debated topic in e-mail marketing: verified opt-in.
Verifying your lead
Suppose you come to my Web site and sign up for my newsletter. You enter 
the name U. Big Dope along with the e-mail address of some person you 
don’t much like. What happens next is that your “friend” gets an e-mail from 
me addressed to U. Big Dope. You’re anonymous, your acquaintance is 
mad at me, and I’m innocently confused by the whole thing. I may end up 
being blacklisted by spam filters for too many of these lapses. (This actually 
happened to me a couple of years ago, but the actual name was much more 
offensive than U. Big Dope. The perpetrator targeted a couple of guys in 
his office as recipients of this prank, for which I was blamed. Needless to say, 
I’ve tended toward verified opt-in ever since.)
AWeber and other e-mail-marketing services have “solved” this problem, 
sort of, by creating a higher category of opt-in: verified or double opt-in. In 
this system, people who opt in receive one e-mail with a link they can click 
to really join the list. Essentially, this step says, “I’m going to make sure you 
are who you say you are by sending you this e-mail. If you didn’t request this 
information, you don’t have to do anything. Sorry about that.”
Verified opt-in protects you from accusations of spamming. No matter how 
often you send out e-mails, some of your leads will wake up one morning with 
no recollection of your existence, find your e-mail in their inbox, and report 
it as spam with a single click. If they opted in using verified opt-in, you can 
prove to the spam police that you weren’t e-mailing without permission.
Also, verified opt-in gives you a higher quality list. The more hoops people 
have to jump through to receive your e-mails, the hungrier they are for your 
information.

241
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
The one big problem with verified opt-in is that it depresses sign-ups. 
Especially if your market acts impulsively, your prospects may have cooled 
down in the 10 minutes it took your e-mail to meet their eyes. Instructions on 
your landing page and customization of the confirmation e-mail can improve 
your conversion rate, but you won’t build as big a list with verified opt-in.
Following up automatically with 
an e-mail autoresponder
The e-mail autoresponder is one of the coolest tools ever invented, right up 
there with Pez dispensers and bicycle brakes. You can preload a series of 
e-mail messages, and when someone opts in to your list, they receive the 
series in order, according to the schedule you set. You can merge fields to 
make the e-mail look exactly like a personal correspondence. Done right, your 
autoresponder sequence will mimic what you would write to each prospect 
if you had all the time in the world. You can schedule e-mails days, weeks, 
months and even years in advance. Figure 11-5 shows an autoresponder 
sequence of eight e-mails, the first four of which are scheduled as follows 
(the Interval column is in number of days):
Message 1: immediately
Message 2: 1 day later
Message 3: 3 days after message 2
Message 4: 3 days after message 3
 
Figure 11-5:

and seven

messages.
 

242
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
But wait, there’s more! You can create multiple lists, and set rules about sub-
scribing and unsubscribing based on certain conditions. For Leads into Gold, 
my sequence consists of 18 messages sent over about two months. But what 
if someone buys on Day 17? Do I want to keep asking them to buy? Obviously 
not. I created a rule that says, “When someone on the list buys Leads into 
Gold, remove them from the prospect list and add them to the customer list.” 
My customer sequence consists of 12 messages, also spread over about two 
months, that give advice, offer support, and tell them about other things they 
may want to buy.
I’ll show you how to perform this magic again using AWeber, the service I 
use and recommend. You discover how to use the AWeber Control Panel to 
build an opt-in form earlier in this chapter. If you haven’t yet signed up for an 
AWeber account, go to www.aweber.com and order now. You have 30 days in 
which to change your mind and get a full refund.
Changing your list name
From the AWeber home page, click List Settings to change the name of 
your list to something relevant to your business. If you use verified opt-in, 
the list name will be the main clue your prospects will see as they decide 
whether to opt-in. Would you agree to receive e-mails from someone named 
default389178? If your ideal name is taken, think of variations — you have 
15 characters to play with. My list names for my Gout e-book include gout-
recipes, gout, and goutbook. For my marketing business, I use list names 
like adwords, adwordscoaching, askhowie, coachmarketing, email-
club, emailstrategy, guide, and question. I improved my verified opt-in 
percentage when I changed the name of my Leads into Gold prospect list 
from 2freechapters to leadsgold-2free.
Changing to verified opt-in
To change to verified opt-in, follow these steps:
 
1. From the List Settings tab, click the Verified Opt-in tab in the 
submenu.
 
2. Click the OFF link to turn on Verified Opt-in for your Web forms, as 
shown in Figure 11-6.
 
3. Say yes to the pop-up warning and you’re in complete compliance 
with e-mail-marketing best practices.
 
 Give yourself a pat on the back.
Next, you need to customize the verification message your prospects will 
receive. Your job is to get them to open the e-mail by choosing or creating the 
right subject line, and then getting them to click the link that puts them on 
your list. Click the Subject box to bring up the Pre-Approved Subject 

243
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
drop-down list and scan the subjects first. Which one most closely connects 
with what you promise? Is it a subscription? A request for information? Do 
you want to include a capitalized pre-head like RESPONSE REQUIRED? Do you 
want to include or omit the @aweber e-mail suffix? (Hint: Omit it.)
 
Figure 11-6: 
Change to

opt-in to

and worse.
 
The advantage of using a pre-approved subject line is, well, they’re pre-
approved. I prefer to write my own custom subject lines, enter the text in the 
Custom Subject text box, and wait for the AWeber folks to approve them. One 
of my favorites is, “Making sure you signed up on purpose for {!listname}.” 
That helps them connect to me while saying exactly why I’m sending this 
e-mail.
In the Custom First Paragraph text box, simply repeat the offer and tell them 
what to do. For example:
Hi {!firstname_fix},
Congratulations on your purchase of Leads into Gold!
To receive the promised bonuses, simply click the

Save your changes by clicking the Save button at the bottom right; then 
review the verification message you’ve edited. When you’re satisfied, click 
the Messages tab to start creating your autoresponder sequence.
Planning your e-mail sequence
When Abraham Lincoln was asked how long a man’s legs should be, he 
famously retorted, “Long enough to reach the ground.” When I am asked how 
long an e-mail sequence should be, I give the same answer and watch my 
clients’ heads spin in confusion. Actually, I paraphrase Honest Abe and say, 
“Long enough to turn your best prospects into buyers.” It really depends on 
the circumstances: the market, the keyword, the offer, the first sale.
Ask yourself: What is your prospects’ interest cycle? How long will they focus 
on this itch before losing interest? Some itches go away by themselves after 
a few minutes or hours. In those cases, your best strategy is to go for the sale 
right away. Other itches can linger for years — soundproofing a noisy restau-
rant, losing 15 pounds, learning to play the ukulele. Your e-mail scheduling 
strategy depends on their interest cycle and the urgency of their need.
Your choices for e-mail content are so vast that I could write a book just 
on e-mail–autoresponder marketing. (Hey, maybe that will be my next For 
Dummies book!) Here are several strategies to choose from as you create 
your sequence:
 
✓ Consumption of your LGM: Just because people download your spe-
cial report or software demo, doesn’t mean they’re going to read it or 
start using it. In fact, thanks to ferret-on-caffeine attention spans, they 
probably don’t remember where they saved the file, or that they have 
the software. Your first e-mails should help them consume your LGM in 
manageable chunks. Reassure them: “If you haven’t gotten to the white 
paper yet, I understand. You’ll get to it when you get to it. When you do, 
I’d love to hear your thoughts.”
 
 Remind them why they wanted your LGM in the first place. Tell them 
about the great strategy on page 9. Show them a cool way to create a 
color-coded mind map using your software.
 
✓ Soliciting engagement: My most successful autoresponder message 
of all time goes out one day after my prospect has opted in. I’ve used 
this for my products and for various clients, and it always gets a great 
response:
Hi Betsy,
     Yesterday you visited FitFam.com and downloaded the Action Guide.
     (If you haven’t gotten your copy yet, it’s at www.FitFam.com/home/
Actionguide.)

245
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
    I just wanted to ask you, was it helpful? What were you looking for
when you came to the site? (If you haven’t read it yet, I
totally understand. You’ll get to it when you get to it.)
    If you’ll hit reply, I’d love to hear from you. I want to make sure
the information on the site is as helpful as possible.
All the best,
Howie Jacobson, Ph.D.
www.FitFam.com
 
 This chatty e-mail starts a dialogue with prospects. They reply out of 
courtesy, because it looks to them like I sat down and wrote this just 
to them, and it would be rude not to reply. I always reply to their reply, 
thanking them for their feedback, and asking more questions about their 
situation. Before you know it, I’m doing consultative selling with zero 
sales resistance. I’ll offer to help them over the phone, and very often 
can take the prospect to the next step in the sales funnel just by virtue 
of this e-mail.
 
✓ Teaching and guiding: My Leads into Gold e-mail sequence contains 
some very long e-mails. Each one is a short chapter on direct marketing. 
For people hungry for information on how to grow their business, these 
e-mails make me a valuable resource. Some of them reason, “If this is his 
free stuff, imagine how good his paid stuff must be.”
 
✓ Offering more good stuff: If you have a second white paper, an audio 
interview, or a free teleseminar, you can build goodwill and establish 
yourself as the expert by offering them to your prospects. Remember, 
most people start their search wide, looking in lots of places for infor-
mation, but quickly narrow their informational intake filter to let in one 
primary source. Your goal is to be that one source.
 
✓ Selling: Yes, you can make offers and convince your prospects to take 
you up on those offers in e-mail. You’ll be more successful in converting 
those offers if they are the minority of your e-mails, and if the e-mails 
that do sell educate or entertain (preferably both).
 
The best way to learn about what works is to get on a bunch of lists and expe-
rience various autoresponder sequences. Create folders in your e-mail pro-
gram for each sequence, print the e-mails and study them. What’s the ratio of 
valuable content to sales pitch? Is the tone professional, folksy, in-your-face, or 
humorous? Are their motives transparent or veiled? Are the messages short, 
medium, or long? What’s the purpose of each e-mail? Was it effective for you? 
Would it work in your market? And so on.
 
Go to www.askhowie.com/autoresponders for a list of autoresponders to 
study and model.

246
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Pay special attention to the two most important elements on an e-mail: the 
Subject line and the From line.
 
✓ The From line: Before we read an e-mail, we look to see who sent it. If 
your leads know you only as Pat the Welder, they probably won’t open 
an e-mail from Patricia McLaughlin. You can change the From address 
at the bottom of the AWeber List Settings page. The name next to the 
checked From/Reply box is the one your prospects see in the From line.
 
✓ The Subject line: The subject line serves one function: to get the user to 
open the e-mail and read it. You can use curiosity triggers, benefit triggers, 
and any of the strategies discussed in Chapter 6. Your subject line is the 
headline of your e-mail, the thing your prospect spends a millisecond 
scanning before deciding whether to read the message or delete it.
Creating an autoresponder sequence using AWeber
After you rename your list and set your verified opt-in preferences 
(described earlier in this chapter), you’re ready to create e-mail messages. 
Click the Messages tab to see a list of your current messages (none, if you 
haven’t created any yet). Click the Add Message button to create your first 
autoresponse.
 
If you are already collecting leads, they will receive your autoresponse e-mails. 
If you’re just playing around, create a second list that only you will see, as 
shown in Figure 11-7. You can create new lists by clicking the small Create and 
Manage Lists link next to the current list name at the top left, and then clicking 
the bright green Create a New List link on the next page.
Creating a message
For now, my advice is to stick with plain text e-mails, not HTML. Plain text 
e-mails are delivered at higher rates, are simpler to create, and mirror the 
normal e-mails your prospects send and receive every day. They won’t neces-
sarily stand out and scream, “You can ignore me because I’m not from a real 
person.”
If you select the Click Tracking check box, you can see how many leads 
click links within your e-mails, which is very useful information. However, 
the downside of using plain text messages is that your pretty links (www.
fitfam.com/actionguide, for example) will turn into hideous AWeber 
links with lots of funny characters and may scare people into not clicking.
Type your subject (the default, “Insert Your Subject Here” is not recom-
mended) in the Subject text box, and then type your plain text message or 
import it from a text file or Word document into the Plain Text Message box. 
AWeber shows you its recommended width of 68 characters per line. If you 
click Wrap Long Lines after inputting your message, AWeber will automati-
cally reformat it to that width.

Create and Manage Lists link
I often make my e-mail messages half that width, or about 35 characters per 
line, to make them very easy on the eye and encourage my readers to scroll 
all the way to the end. After creating the message, save it (by clicking the 
Save button at the bottom right) to return to the message list.
Using personalization fields
You can personalize the e-mail message to each lead, using dozens of differ-
ent fields, some of which are shown in Figure 11-8. I generally include the first 
name in the salutation, as follows:
Hi {!firstname_fix}
The _fix at the end capitalizes the first letter of the name and makes the 
rest lowercase, in case someone typed in his name as HOwie and you don’t 
want to show him those two capital letters in every e-mail.
To view the actual e-mail generated by the message in Figure 11-8, visit www.
askhowie.com/personal and complete the form. It’s verified opt-in, so 
you have to confirm the first e-mail to receive the second. How close to your 
actual city did AWeber get? In my case, within about 270 miles — not very 
impressive. Oh well.

Click Test to send yourself a copy of the message. Do this with every e-mail 
you ever put into AWeber. Click every link within those e-mails. You’ll save 
yourself a lot of “oops” e-mails, the ones where you say, “Gee, I’m sorry that 
the links didn’t work in the last e-mail I sent out.” Take the time to get it right, 
so you don’t raise unnecessary doubts about your competence.
Scheduling your next message
For all autoresponder messages after the first one, you have to decide when 
you want the e-mail to be sent. AWeber allows you to choose any number 
of days, from 0 through 999, following the previous message. If you have a 
sequence that sends an e-mail a day for 5 days, then once a week for 3 weeks, 
and then once every 28 days forever, you configure it as follows:

249
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
Message 1: Instantaneous
Message 2: 1 Day Delay
Message 3: 1 Day Delay
Message 4: 1 Day Delay
Message 5: 1 Day Delay
Message 6: 7 Day Delay
Message 7: 7 Day Delay
Message 8: 7 Day Delay
Message 9: 28 Day Delay
Message 10: 28 Day Delay
And so on . . .
Generally, you want to send more frequent e-mails at the beginning of the 
sequence, and drop down to a stay-in-touch-once-a-month frequency after 
a month or so. The last thing your prospect wants is to go on vacation for 
a couple of weeks and return to an inbox full of you. (Actually, an inbox full 
of “Send this e-mail to 20 people within 10 minutes or your nose will fall off” 
might be worse, but you get the point.)
Scheduling an e-mail is simple: Click the Add Message button at the bottom of 
your list of e-mails to create a new one. At the top of the next page, the first 
field you can edit has the default number 4 in it. If you leave it as is, this mes-
sage will be sent four days after the previous message. To send this message 
the very next day, change it to 1 (see Figure 11-9). If you’re using a different 
autoresponder service, make sure you understand their format. Some of 
them ask you to schedule based on the signup date, rather than the previous 
e-mail.

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Your autoresponse e-mails fall into one of two categories: obvious parts of 
a sequence, or simulated real time e-mails. If you offer an e-mail course, the 
messages that deliver the course don’t have to “pretend” to be a note you 
just dashed off. Something as simple as
Hi Howie,
Here’s Part 1 of the 17-Part E-mail Course, “How to Clean Your Fingernails”
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
Part 1: Finding Your Fingernails
Many of my clients have such dirty fingernails, they can’t even find them
anymore. Here’s where to look: at the ends of your fingers, just opposite the
part with the fingerprint . . .
And so on . . .
will get the job done. After the course is over, you can start communicating in 
a chattier and natural way:
Hi Howie,
I was recently talking to a client who complained, “Fran, my fingernails are now
spotless, but my toenails are a mess. What do you suggest?”
Goodness, but I guffawed when I heard that one. Did he think I had another
17-part course about toenails?
The answer, obviously, is “Wear shoes and nobody will notice.”
But then we started talking about the spring wedding season approaching, and it
occurred to me that you might find occasion to don footwear with open toes in
the coming months.
And so on . . .
Try to keep these messages “evergreen” by avoiding references that will date 
them. Don’t say, “I was watching the Oscars last night,” because someone on 
your list will receive your message in September and dismiss you as a liar or 
TiVo addict. Do read over your messages once or twice a year to nip stale-
ness in the bud. If you talk about a celebrity who has died since you wrote 
the e-mail, it may come across as offensive, if not just outdated.
 
The goal of the autoresponder is to automate what you would do anyway if 
you had a million hours a day and nothing better to do. When you plan each 
message and each sequence, ask yourself, “Knowing what I know about this 
lead, what would I write to them today?”
The purpose of your first autoresponder sequence is to turn your lead 
into a buyer (or at least to help your lead to decide whether they should 
become a buyer). Your e-mails continue to hammer at pain points, educate, 

251
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
offer solutions, build credibility, invite feedback — everything you would do 
if you were the account manager and this lead was a hot prospect.
Using autoresponders to move leads and customers 
through your sales funnel
Say you sell three products, and you want your customers to buy them in this 
order: Product 1, Product 2, Product 3. You can set up three autoresponders 
as follows:
 
✓ Prospect List: A sequence of e-mails to get your opt-ins to buy Product 1.
 
✓ New Customer List: A sequence of e-mails to get your customers to buy 
Product 2.
 
 Here’s the coolest feature of all: when someone buys Product 1, AWeber 
automatically adds them to the New Customer list and unsubscribes 
them from the Prospect List. You don’t have to subject your customers 
to a sales pitch for a product they already bought. You can also avoid 
the worst-case scenario of offering a better deal for something they 
already bought.
 
✓ Returning Customer List: A sequence of e-mails to get your customers 
who already own Products 1 and 2 to buy Product 3.
Setting up automatic unsubscribe
To set up automatic unsubscribe, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a second AWeber list by clicking Add New next to the list name 
at the top left.
 
2. On the next page, click the green Create List button and complete and 
save the forms on the Success page.
 
 This new list will be for new customers who just bought your first product.
 
3. Change the list to your first list by selecting it from the drop-down list 
next to Current List, as shown in Figure 11-10.
 
4. Once you’re managing the list that leads will unsubscribe from when 
they subscribe to the new list, go to the List Settings tab and click 
Automation from the submenu.
 
5. From the drop-down list in the center of the page, select Unsubscribe 
from List {name of first list} When Lead Subscribes To {name of 
second list} (see Figure 11-11).
 
6. Next, select the new list name from the drop-down list under the List 
column.
 
7. Click the Save button to save the changes and read the Action you’ve 
saved, to make sure it’s what you want AWeber to do.

If you have an online shopping cart, you can set it up to forward the customer 
information to AWeber after a sale is made. AWeber will then perform the auto-
mated rule, removing the customer from the prospect list and adding the 
name to the customer list. If you don’t yet have an online shopping cart, go to 
www.askhowie.com/cart for some recommendations.
Don’t be an accidental spammer
No discussion of e-mail would be complete without a foray into the wacky 
world of spam (junk e-mail). I know you get hundreds of them a week, if not 
each day, and you’re saying to yourself, “But I would never send out an e-mail 
offering a fake Rolex. I don’t even know where to find fake Rolexes.” Or you’re 
saying, “I’ve had enough of this chapter. I’m going to put this book down and 

253
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
try that new Indian restaurant, the one next to the beauty shop and the pizza 
place.” (Sorry, I can’t reveal how I do that trick.)
Spam has become such a huge annoyance to e-mail users that many Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs) have become hyper-aggressive in their spam filtering. 
Your e-mails may be going to leads who opted in and are hungering for them; 
the e-mails may be completely appropriate, but the big dumb filters are pro-
grammed to stop everything that doesn’t come from Aunt Sadie and Uncle Lou.
If AOL or EarthLink incorrectly tags your e-mails as spam, you may find your-
self sending 2,000 e-mails but having only 400 delivered. Spam is a big topic, 
but the following tips will help you avoid the worst mistakes made by inno-
cent marketers.
Use plain text instead of HTML
Spammers use HTML to do all sorts of nefarious things in e-mails. A brand of 
spamming known as phishing creates e-mails that look exactly like big com-
panies, such as financial institutions, eBay, or PayPal, sent them. Their goal 
is to get unsuspecting customers to click to fake sites that look like the real 
ones and enter sensitive data. If your e-mails are in plain text, it shows you’re 
not hiding anything. Spam filters like that transparency, and bother plain text 
e-mails less.
Keep links to a minimum
Avoid putting lots of links in your e-mails. Remember, each e-mail should 
compel a single action. Too much choice is bad marketing, regardless of 
spam considerations. You can repeat a link at the top and bottom of a long 
e-mail, but don’t give your reader half a dozen choices.
Avoid common spam trigger words
Words like free, mortgage, pornography, spam, make money, enlarge-
ment, and others alert filters that a message may be spam. In the past, you 
could fool a filter with punctuation tricks, such as fr.ee and m@ke m0ney, 
but the filters now look at tricks like these as spam markers.
So what do you do if you’re in the mortgage business, or a similar legitimate 
enterprise that uses spammy words? One solution is to put your e-mails on 
your Web site, and write short e-mails with links:
Hi Bartleby,
Today’s installment of “Affording a New Home” is available at
www.yoursite.com/newhome23
It talks about the three mistakes that can cost you big time, as well as a time-
saving resource you’ll wish you had discovered years ago.
Enjoy,

Putting your e-mails online will reduce readership, so you have to work hard 
to entice your reader to click the link and view your message.
Don’t send attachments
If you have a legitimate attachment, such as a PDF document or software 
demo download, put a link in your e-mail to a Web page where that file can be 
downloaded. Files attached to your e-mails can contain viruses. Also, large 
attachments can crash your readers’ e-mail servers or just get your messages 
hung up in cyber-limbo.
 
For more tips on beating an undeserved spam rap, visit http://www.ask
howie.com/spam . (See that extra space before the period? Just a subtle 
reminder, courtesy of the “Random e-mail tip” sidebar, elsewhere in this 
chapter.)
Broadcast e-mails
The other e-mail workhorse for your online business is the broadcast. This 
works just like a combination of regular e-mail (you pick a recipient, type 
something, and send it) and the AWeber system (you can merge fields just 
like the autoresponses; you can schedule it to go out at a particular date and 
time; you can send it to hundreds or thousands of people at once).
To send a broadcast, go to the AWeber site, click the Messages tab, and 
choose Broadcast from the submenu. Click the green Create Broadcast 
Message button in the center of the page to get started. The first thing you 
notice is that this form is the same as the form for creating an autoresponder, 
with only tiny yet crucially important differences:
Random e-mail tip
Leave a space after a URL before adding punc-
tuation. Web browsers often include periods 
and commas that appear at the end of the URL, 
so someone might click your working link and 
end up with that nasty “Page Not Found” error.

✓ Instead of choosing a sending interval, you are prompted to enter a date 
and time. The default is right now.
 
✓ You can segment this list by creating a view and sending only to leads 
who meet certain criteria (see the “Managing your e-mail list” section, 
later in this chapter, for instructions on creating and using views.)
 
 The default views in the drop-down list use time and deliverability as 
the criteria. You can send a broadcast e-mail to all leads who subscribe 
within a certain period. You can also resend a broadcast to leads who, 
for some reason, haven’t been able to receive your regular e-mails 
because of spam filters or other problems.
 
✓ Instead of sending the message to just one list, you now can send it to 
multiple lists. You can also exclude lists. Just click the Send To Multiple 
Lists Or Exclude Lists link to open a table where you can choose the lists 
to include or exclude.
I use broadcasts to send my weekly BOPzine (Breakthrough Online Profits 
e-zine), let my customers know about special events, send time-sensitive 
information, and to send out newsletters. I also use broadcasts to fill my 
autoresponders while making sure that my newest leads don’t miss anything 
good.
Special events
Often I run webinars (live on-screen demos along with conference calls) to 
which I invite my customers and subscribers. Recently I sent an e-mail to 
several of my marketing-related lists, letting them know about a webinar dem-
onstrating the features of the just-released new AdWords interface (recording 
available for viewing at www.askhowie.com/interface-webinar, if you’re 
interested). Obviously, I can’t put a message like that in an autoresponder.
You can use broadcasts for sales, announcements, coupons, news, opportuni-
ties; anything that is time-sensitive and of interest to a significant segment of 
your list.
E-newsletters
E-newsletters, also called ezines (which nobody knows how to pronounce), 
are regular communications from you to your customer base. You can create 
a publishing schedule or just send one out when the mood strikes. The most 
successful e-newsletter publishers I know stick to a schedule and never devi-
ate. Because you can schedule a broadcast for a future date, you can create 
six newsletters and have AWeber send them out weekly while you drink yak 
milk and climb K2.

Writing great newsletters
E-newsletter wizard Michael Katz, of www.
bluepenguindevelopment.com, is one 
of the few people whose newsletters I read as 
soon as they arrive. Michael teaches profes-
sional service providers — coaches, consul-
tants, trainers, accountants and other people 
who sell their expertise — to build relationships 
with prospects through regular e-mail newslet-
ters. Here’s Michael on the four commandments 
of e-newsletters:
What I’m about to tell you is so valuable, that 
I frankly wouldn’t blame you if after reading 
it, you felt compelled to take $5.00 out of your 
wallet, stuff it in an envelope and send it directly 
to me. Here’s why: What I’m going to share with 
you now are the four guidelines we use to make 
sure that all the newsletters we’re involved in 
stay on track. Here they are:
 ✓ Make It Useful:
 
 With a business-to-business newsletter in 
particular, it’s difficult to get any traction 
with readers if you don’t give them some 
kind of actionable “aha” with every issue 
you send. They are barraged with e-mails, 
and eager to click the delete button as often 
as possible.
 
 Your goal therefore, is to give them pause. 
To make them live in fear that if they delete 
your newsletter, they will miss some insight 
that would have made a significant impact 
on their success. Useful information rises to 
the top of the pile, and when your newslet-
ter is on top, you need not worry about how 
big the pile is.
 ✓ Make It Interesting:
 
 I don’t know who started the rumor that sig-
nificant and profitable businesses must also 
be serious and boring, but it seems to have 
caught on nonetheless. That’s good news 
for you and me. Because with all the dry as 
dust E-Newsletters out there, all trying to 
sound like the front page of the Wall Street 
Journal, we can make our newsletters 
shine with little effort.
 
 Personal anecdotes, conversational lan-
guage and the occasional joke here and 
there will keep your readers involved long 
enough for them to hear the “real” informa-
tion you’re trying to give them. They proba-
bly won’t read it just because it’s interesting, 
but they certainly won’t read it if it’s not.
 ✓ Make It Simple:
 
 An effective newsletter isn’t a doctoral 
thesis; it’s not even a case study. It’s what 
I like to call, “a nugget.” One insight or tip 
or concept that your readers can take in, 
understand, and hopefully remember long 
enough to put into practice. If you give me 
too much information (even if it’s good), I’m 
likely to stockpile your newsletters until I 
delete them in one, “I’ll never get around 
to reading these old ones anyway” frenzy. 
Give your readers something small enough 
to understand and remember.
 ✓ Make It Authentic:
 
 Done right, your E-Newsletter is the voice 
of your company. It reflects your unique 
personality and culture, whatever that hap-
pens to be.
 
 I’ve walked into enough companies to 
know that each of them — even the ones 
in seemingly straight laced, hard to differ-
entiate industries — has its own language, 
pace, sense of humor and approach. Don’t 
hide all that in an effort to sound “profes-
sional.” Marketing is the opposite of fitting 
in — do yourself a favor and fit out!
For more of Michael’s wit and wisdom, go to

to read his latest newsletter and join his list. He 
might even reveal how to pronounce ezine.

Repurposing broadcast e-mails to build your autoresponder sequence
Say you’ve created an autoresponder sequence that lasts five months and 
then stops. One day you’re driving on the highway and this idea hits you for 
a great next e-mail for that sequence. You rush home and type the e-mail into 
your autoresponder sequence, 30 days after the last message. Let’s call it the 
180th day of the whole series.
Now everyone on that list who hasn’t been on your list for more than 179 
days will receive that message. But it’s sad that the people who have been 
on your list for more than six months will never see your message. You could 
put it in your autoresponder and send it as a broadcast, but then all the new 
people will get the same e-mail twice.
 
The solution, as revealed to me by Perry Marshall during the intermission of a 
Blue Man Group performance in Las Vegas, is simple and elegant: Calculate 
how many days after subscribing someone will receive the autoresponse 
e-mail. Send the e-mail today as a broadcast, and make a note on your calen-
dar to enter it into your autoresponder sequence that many days in the future.
Continuing with our example, let’s say today is March 16. You will add the 
message to your autoresponder sequence on day 180. Send the broadcast 
to your list today, and on September 16, add the message to day 180 of your 
sequence. That way, everyone on your list will receive the message once, and 
no one will receive it twice.
Managing your e-mail lists
You can manage your e-mail lists by clicking the Leads tab on the AWeber 
site. You can search and sort by any of the data you collect. Click Select Field 
in any of the drop-down lists to view your choices. You can select filters and 
a sort order and save that view, in case you need to come back to it again. 
Once you generate the view (or just click Display View with All Leads show-
ing to see your entire list), you can manage individual leads.
You can stop the autoresponder sequence for a lead by checking that person’s 
box in the Stop column. You can reset the last message they received to put 
them backward or forward in the sequence. You can erase them entirely — 
when someone complains to me about spam but doesn’t unsubscribe via the 
link that appears at the bottom of every single e-mail I send them (what, me 
frustrated and bitter?), I erase them from the list to prevent future problems.
If you click the e-mail address, you can edit more information about your lead 
in the pop-over window: name, e-mail, ad tracking, last message delivered, 
and a miscellaneous notes field.

ment techniques. You can find these and other AWeber tutorials at www.ask

Going Offline to Build the Relationship
When you start conducting business online, it’s easy to be seduced by the 
automation and anonymity of e-mail and Web site. Imagine a business that 
never requires you to talk with customers, lick a stamp, buy an envelope, or 
write a check. You could die and keep making money for years!
What many online-only businesspeople don’t realize is they’re sacrificing 
growth for convenience, or perhaps laziness. If you collect phone numbers, 
you can follow up via the telephone. Ditto for the fax machine, which is 
making a comeback as a permission-based follow-up medium that’s consid-
erably less cluttered than the e-mail inbox. (And faxes are less likely to be 
blocked than mass e-mail messages.) The mail, including the postal service 
as well as private carriers like FedEx and UPS, is a great way to stay in touch 
with prospects.
I can’t begin to cover offline follow-up strategies in this book about AdWords. 
(Remember AdWords? This is a book about AdWords.) But they are so near 
and dear to my heart, I want to share one quick and clever way to use e-mail, 
your Web site, and the telephone together to grow your business:
 
1. Choose a time and date for a teleconference call.
 
2. Go to www.freeconferencecall.com and sign up for a free 96-person 
conference call line.
 
3. E-mail your list to let them know about a teleconference you will be hold-
ing to answer their biggest questions. Include a link to a page on your 
Web site where they can take a short survey to register for the call.
 
4. Look over the survey results and pick the questions you will answer on 
the call.
 
5. Ask a friend or colleague with a nice voice to interview you by asking 
you the questions you’ve chosen. If you’re brave, they can also moder-
ate and help you field live questions from teleconference participants.
 
6. Record the call, using the www.freeconferencecall.com recording 
feature (free, but not such great quality), or an audio-recording service, 
such as www.audioacrobat.com.

259
 Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects
 
7. Download the recording, and either edit it with the free Audacity pro-
gram (available at http://audacity.sourceforge.net) or the 
audio editing software of your choice, or post it as an .mp3 file to your 
Web site.
 
8. E-mail your list, letting readers know that the teleconference is available 
for them to listen to online or to download to their PC or iPod.
 
9. If you’ve said some good stuff, pay a transcription service to turn the 
recording into a Word document. (You can find freelance transcription-
ists by posting a project at www.guru.com or any similar freelance 
brokerage site.) Edit it, make it graphically pretty, turn it into a PDF 
document, and put it on your Web site.
 
10. If you’ve shared some great material that your prospects and customers 
want, you can do any or all of the following:
 
a. Give it away free on your site.
 
b. Give it away free as an LGM in exchange for an opt-in.
 
c. Turn it into a CD and/or printed manual and sell it as a product.
 
d. Use it as a bonus to compel some other desired action.
 
e. Let other people reproduce the CD and manual and include them 
as bonuses with their products.
 
f. Come up with a brand new use that no one has ever thought of 
before.

Web Site
In This Chapter

▶ Using multimedia to get closer to your customers
▶ Turning your business into a testimonial farm
▶ Using PHP to personalize your site for returning customers
Y
our business is just a system for turning complete strangers into great 
customers. AdWords finds you the strangers, your ad invites them in, 
and your landing page opt-in and e-mail give you the ability to keep the 
conversation going. Your Web site contains the content that will turn leads 
into buyers, buyers into repeat customers, and customers into referral 
sources and advocates.
One way to look at your Web site is purely numerically: traffic in, money out. 
In a nutshell, the game of online marketing can be reduced to that equation. 
Your Web site, in this view, is a tool for extracting cash from visitors. You set 
up conversion tracking and analytics and reports to find out how good your 
Web site is at extracting a purchase from which visitors (see Chapters 14 and 
15). You run split tests to increase the amount of money you get per visitor 
(see Chapter 13). But when you actually design and build your Web site, sales 
and money should be the farthest thing from your mind. Instead, you focus 
on growing customers.
The big goal of your Web site is to develop the relationship between you and 
your customers. Sales are part of that relationship, and an important part — 
after all, you can’t take satisfaction or good will to the bank or the grocery store 
or the music store on Broad Street with the gorgeous Weber mandolins — er, 
excuse me, where was I?

262
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Oh, yes, the relationship. The typical online business can identify several 
stages of customer: first-time buyer, second-time buyer, third-time buyer 
(now the customer is a habit, not a fluke), referral source, and advocate. You 
may be protesting that your business is different because you only have one 
thing to sell to a customer. That may be true, for now, but the real competitive 
advantage online is not the best AdWords campaign, or the best Web graphics, 
but the best relationship with customers. If your customers are worth more 
to you than your AdWords competitors’ customers are worth to them, you 
eventually win — and win big.
Your Web site can be a potent partner in farming the seeds of leads into 
fruit-bearing customers. (Hey, that last sentence was poetically metaphorical. 
Excuse me while I high-five myself.) This chapter shows you how to use various 
tools on your Web site to grow customers, clients, and an enthusiastic 
volunteer sales force.
Identifying the Rungs of 
Your Business Ladder
Take a few moments now to sketch the perfect trajectory of a new visitor to 
your Web site. What’s the first measurable outcome you desire? An opt-in? A 
sale? To engage you in a chat? To ask a question via a form? To call your 
business phone?
After they take that step, what’s the next one? If they opted in, it may be a 
sale, a second opt-in to a new list, attending a teleseminar, or scheduling a 
phone call. If they already bought, maybe you have an upsell they should get. 
Maybe you want them to send you a testimonial, to refer five friends, or to 
use the product they bought, instead of putting it on a shelf unopened.
What’s the top rung of your customer ladder? Think of the top 20 percent 
of your current customers — what puts them in that category? If you have 
customers who’ve maxed out your business, can you build a new rung at the 
top so they can ascend even higher? A private coaching club? A membership 
site? A chocolate-themed cruise?
Every business is different; take a few minutes now to identify the rungs of 
your business before continuing. When you know where you want to go, 
it’s much easier to help visitors get there. Let’s look at a few rungs that are 
common to most businesses:
 
✓ The Lead: The bread and butter of the online business is the lead — the 
visitor with whom you can communicate even after he or she leaves 
your site. In Chapter 11, I cover strategies and tactics for getting visitors 

263
 Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site
to opt in to your list. I also share how you can use e-mail to bring them 
back to your Web site. E-mail is great, but limited. The e-mail inbox is too 
competitive and distracting a space to hold an intimate conversation. It’s 
like trying to have a date in a restaurant booth surrounded by comedians, 
competitors, fake-Rolex peddlers, and all their friends and family. Also, 
spam filters make it hard to say much of anything related to selling. The 
wise online marketer uses e-mail to bring leads back to the Web site.
 
 The lead has uttered a soft, tentative “Maybe” in response to your 
overtures. Your job is to make the leads glad for the chance they’ve 
taken, and provide value far beyond their expectations. You are aiming 
for the three magic verbs: know, like, and trust. When your leads think 
they know you, feel warmly toward you, and believe you to be trustworthy, 
they’ll take a chance with a first purchase.
 
✓ The First-Time Buyer: The one-time customer has taken a leap of faith. 
The “Yes” is followed by “Okay, show me what you’ve got.” Don’t think 
of the first sale as closing anything. Your customer just opened the door 
and invited you into the front hall. The customer hasn’t taken your coat, 
or invited you to sit down. Now is the time to prove yourself.
 
✓ The Second-Time Buyer: The second sale shows that you’ve passed the 
first customer test. Your product or service did what you said it would, 
or more, and you haven’t alienated the person with poor customer service. 
Your job now is to take your prospects off the market entirely, so they 
will never consider patronizing a competitor’s business. They must feel 
that you are their protector, watching out for their best interests and 
more concerned for their needs than your own.
 
✓ The Third-Time Buyer: The third-time buyer has established a trend 
and a habit. These buyers have committed part of their self-esteem to 
proving themselves right, and will continue to buy from you as long as 
you don’t ignore or mistreat them. Your goal is to get them to the point 
where they feel comfortable telling their friends about you.
 
✓ The Referrer: Visitors to your Web site who have been referred by 
someone they trust is completely different from search engine or pay-
per-click traffic. They come with positive expectations and an optimistic 
filter, and will doubt and argue less than a complete stranger. When your 
customers take the time and effort to send others to you, you have a 
business that can survive just about any change in Google’s algorithm. 
There’s just one more rung to take them to. . . .
 
✓ The Loyal Advocate: Is there a business in your town that you feel so 
good about, you would be angry if a competitor opened up? Those feelings 
are what you want to inspire in your customers. You want them to 
act as your advocates, your advisors, your eyes and ears around the 
marketplace. You want them to post comments and questions to your 
blog, to agree to be recorded and filmed for testimonials, and to shout to 
the world that you run a great business.

Using Web Tools to Help Your 
Visitors up the Ladder
Let’s simplify human behavior for a moment. Peter Bregman (www.bregman
partners.com), author of Point B: A Short Guide to Leading a Big Change, 
points out that people take action when three things are true:
 
1. They know what to do (knowledge)
 
2. They can do it (capability)
 
3. They want to do it (motivation)
This chapter focuses mostly on the third element, motivation. How to get 
people to know, like, and trust you; to show them that the action you want 
them to take will help them avoid pain and gain pleasure; and that it’s the 
easiest, quickest, and cheapest way for them to get there. However, the first 
two points are just as important. If your Web site design is poor, it doesn’t 
matter how magnetic or persuasive you are. You can’t convince visitors to 
click a Buy button they can’t find.
Design
The design of your Web site will either guide your visitors toward rungs of 
your ladder or make those rungs invisible or inaccessible. I’ve seen too 
many Web pages that look like they were designed to prevent sales: tiny 
fonts, distracting graphics, gratuitous Flash animation (as Lemony Snickett 
would say, “‘Gratuitous’ here means ‘your Web designer spent a lot of time 
and money learning how to use that animation software and by golly, they’re 
going to use it every chance they get’”), navigation systems determined by a 
template rather than what will get the visitor’s attention, and shopping carts 
that require more clicks than a Wheel of Fortune booth in Point Pleasant 
Beach.
Is your navigation self-evident? If visitors wanted to buy kettlebells (big 
hunks of iron with handles used by hardcore fitness fiends), could they 
figure out how to find them from your home page? Do you use graphics and 
borders to shine a light on the most-looked-for links on your pages? Or do 
they have to drill through pages like Shop and Weights and Free Weights and 
Miscellaneous to find your Kettlebell selection?
I often coach online entrepreneurs who show me Web sites where the most 
important links are buried in long navigation bars or hidden below the scroll 
bar. When I tell them that I can’t find how to get to the page for restaurant 
owners, they say things like, “It’s in the submenu on the left. Just click Most 
Popular Pages and you’ll see it.”

265
 Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site
As Mike Psenka of Ethority (www.ethority.com) points out, if you have to 
train your visitors to use your site, the navigation isn’t, to use a software-
design buzzword, self-evident. For Mike, self-evident isn’t nearly strong enough 
a term. He strives to create software and reporting that is, in his words, “User 
Ridiculously Obvious.” Take a look at your Web site with new eyes: Is it User 
Ridiculously Obvious?
The next time you’re surfing and searching, pay attention to sites that seem 
easy and obvious to use. Notice where they place their buttons and links, and 
what they call them. Avoid the mystery buttons with icons and no names. 
Keep your design clean and functional — use everything you need, but no 
more. Look at the difference between the home pages of American Airlines 
(Figure 12-1) and JetBlue (Figure 12-2). The American page is busy, with lots 
of links, multiple offers, and several competing graphics. The big graphic at 
the top is animated, and keeps changing as you try to figure out where to go 
to conduct your business.
JetBlue’s home page is simple and sparse, with few colors and a big obvious 
form for the number-one action on this page: booking a flight. The headline, 
“Free TV with purchase,” next to a graphic of the video monitor in the back of 
an airplane seat, emphasizes the JetBlue difference: 36 TV channels on every 
flight.

Figure 12-2: 
JetBlue’s 
home page 
is simple 
and clear, 
focusing 
the visitor 
on the flight 
booking 
form.
 
When you start clicking into the site, the differences become even more 
apparent. Clicking American’s Reservations navigation button brings down a 
long sub-menu with a huge array of options (Figure 12-3). By contrast, when 
you click Where From to start booking your flight on the JetBlue site, a 
beautifully designed list of departure cities appears above the page, as shown 
in Figure 12-4. User-friendly? User Ridiculously Obvious.

And if you’re not convinced of the power of simplicity, perhaps you haven’t 
seen this page: www.google.com. Google became the 900-pound gorilla of 
search partly by making it so easy to conduct a search. No competing graphics 
or links — just a plain box in the center of a nearly empty page. Other search 
engines competing with Google in the late 1990s were trying to cram every 
pixel on their home page with juicy content. Google won by not intimidating or 
confusing its users, as well as by delivering quick and relevant content.
Sales copy
Sales copy refers to the words you use to convince your visitor to take some 
action. You sell opt-ins, you sell free downloads, you sell phone calls, and of 
course you sell products and services.
Even in the dawning multimedia era of the Web, words matter. Your sales 
copy is what ultimately persuades visitors to take actions. We’re creatures of 
inertia and hesitation when it comes to doing business. We don’t want to get 
burned (again). We don’t want to make big mistakes that will be cumbersome 

268
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
and costly to undo (again). As you write, focus on two elements: proof of 
performance and risk reduction. Assuming I want the big benefit you’re 
promising, I will buy from you if I believe it will work for me and if I’m not 
taking a risk.
Proof can come in many forms. If you can demonstrate effectiveness, that’s 
the best. Think of the vacuum-cleaner salesperson who shows that the 
vacuum can suck up a bowling ball — hard to argue with that! Online, many 
products defy demonstration, although video is expanding the horizon. The 
next best thing is to get testimonials and endorsements from real customers, 
describing in their own words what your product or service has done for 
them.
How long your sales copy should be has been the subject of a decades-
long (and utterly pointless) debate in marketing circles. Sales copy should 
be exactly long enough to get the job done, and not one word longer. The 
comprehensiveness of your sales pitch depends on the price of the product 
(more expensive items generally require more substantiation), the severity 
of the need (the ER doctor doesn’t need to give a long speech about why it 
would be good to staunch the flow of blood from the patient’s aorta), and 
your visitor’s familiarity with the product or the producer (I could probably 
sell J.K. Rowling’s next book in five words — “Buy J.K. Rowling’s New Book” — 
but it would take me considerably longer to convince you to buy my 
new Yiddish-style magic/fantasy novel, Chaim Mendel and the Enchanted 
Phylacteries of Thomashevsky).
 
Think about the length of your sales copy this way: How long would you talk 
on a live sales call if your prospect was interested? Would you say 25 words 
and then shut up? Don’t underestimate your prospect’s capacity for interest in 
solving a problem or attaining a goal.
Articles
Not every word on your Web site needs to convince. You build credibility, 
trust, and reciprocity by sharing your expertise. Remember, your sales copy 
is only as good as your reputation. Well-written and helpful articles establish 
your reputation as someone who knows what’s good, and who seeks to be 
helpful.
In addition to building your credibility, articles support the sales process by 
building the need for what you’re selling. For example, if I sell meditation CDs 
for parents and kids, I could include articles about meditation: health effects, 
methods, instructions, stories about transformation brought about by 
meditation, and so on. If I sell special dichromatic green light bulbs for use 
during meditation, I can include articles about the healing properties of green 
light.

269
 Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site
Articles can also dispel confusion and help your visitors take action. If you 
sell four brands of flat-screen TV, your visitor may become overwhelmed at 
all those choices — and do nothing. You can write reviews that compare the 
brands and models, and help visitors decide which one is right for them.
Blog
A Weblog, or blog, is a way of publishing Web content without requiring any 
design or coding skills. If you can write an e-mail, you can publish a blog. The 
way blogs have evolved, with bloggers linking to each other and carrying on 
hyperlinked discussions and arguments back and forth, lend themselves to 
platforms for expertise.
From its origins as a communications outpost for the hopelessly techie and 
its phase as a self-absorbed tell-all medium for high school kids, blogging 
has evolved into a powerful business tool. To be a credible blogger, you not 
only have to know your stuff, but have your pulse on the rest of your market. 
You’ll discuss industry trends, amplify or argue points made by other blogs 
and Web sites in your industry, and act like a key opinion leader in your space.
Another feature of blogs is reader interactivity. Your visitors can add 
comments and questions, engaging in a conversation with you and each 
other. It’s your blog; you benefit from being the host of the party.
 
Dave Taylor of www.intuitive.com teaches clients to blog for business 
purposes. Go to www.askhowie.com/blogrules to find his article on the 7 
Don’ts of Business Blogging.
 
Your keywords’ Quality Scores can benefit from an active blog on your 
site. Google has spent much of the past three years raising the relevance 
requirements of AdWords listings. You can improve the relevance of your 
landing page if it links to dozens or hundreds of other relevant pages. Google 
schedules its inspections of your site according to how often it thinks you 
update the site. An active blog, including comments by visitors, induces 
Google to visit more frequently. The more your site changes, the more up-to-
date and relevant Google assumes it to be.
Audio
The biggest drawback to the Internet as a business medium is its impersonal 
nature. Since people can’t look each other in the eye and shake hands, trust 
will always be a big hurdle in developing business relationships online. 
Psychologists tell us that most human communication is nonverbal — body 
language and tone of voice. The sound of your voice on your Web site can go 
a long way toward making you more real and trustworthy.

270
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
You can easily spend thousands of dollars on Web-audio equipment, and in 
some cases, the investment can be well worth it. But if you just want to see 
whether the addition of a human voice can improve your conversion, start 
with a tool you already own and know how to use: the telephone.
Audio Acrobat offers a service for $20 per month that allows you to create 
audio files for your Web site by talking into a telephone or recording them on 
your computer. You can easily embed the files in your Web site or send them 
via e-mail. Visit www.askhowie.com/audio for a demonstration of the 
service, as well as a video tutorial that shows how to get audio onto your 
Web site within minutes.
Four ways to spice up your Web site with audio include these:
 
✓ Welcome messages and guidance: Robert Middleton puts his message 
and personality right in the center of his home page with an audio 
introduction. He qualifies the prospect, introduces himself and his Web 
site, acknowledges common objections, and ends with a clear call to 
action. The message lasts about a minute, and gives the visitor time to 
browse the home page and see Robert’s smiling face to the left of the 
audio button. By the time the message is over, Robert’s visitors have 
been welcomed, agitated, reassured, guided, and gently pushed toward 
the next step. Experience it for yourself at www.actionplan.com — 
and make sure your computer speakers are turned on.
 
✓ Mini audio sales letters: Mike Stewart takes the introductory audio 
message approach one step further with a mini sales letter. He includes 
two snippets of audio testimonial, and explains why information 
publishers need to add audio to their product mix. You can listen at 
www.internetaudioguy.com by clicking the Play button at the right.
 
✓ Testimonials: Audio is a perfect medium for testimonials, which I cover 
near the end of Chapter 10. The more testimonials you can collect, the 
more credible your sales message. Ken McCarthy of www.thesystem
seminar.org once remarked at a seminar that business owners should 
think of their business as a machine to create testimonials. I’ve collected 
many testimonials for Leads into Gold by requesting them at the end of 
a surprise bonus consultation that I offer. I e-mail some of my customers 
and offer them a 15-minute action consultation, and I set aside half an 
hour. After the consultation, I ask if they would do me a favor and phone 
in what they would say to someone who was on the fence about buying 
Leads into Gold. You can hear some of the best ones at www.leads
intogold.com near the bottom of the page.
 
 Audio Acrobat (www.audioacrobat.com) allows you to create multiple 
testimonial lines, each with its own phone number, so you can provide 
recorded instructions specific to the product or service your caller is 
praising.

271
 Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site
 
✓ High perceived value in your content: You can answer questions, 
interview experts or have other people interview you, read articles 
you’ve written, comment on current issues, solve common problems, 
and do it all over the phone without having to suffer writer’s block. I 
discuss a teleseminar strategy at the end of Chapter 11; you can extend 
this method to collecting and deploying many kinds of valuable audio 
content.
One way to increase the perceived value of your online audio is to offer the 
same audio for sale as a CD. Your visitors have the choice to buy the CD for 
$24.95, or they can simply download the audio in MP3 format free.
 
If you find you need to edit your audios, you’ll find that a well-constructed 
sound-editing program is easier to use than a word processor. For PCs, I love 
Sony’s Sound Forge Audio Studio program because it’s cheap, powerful, and 
simple. The URL for Sound Forge is ridiculously long, so I’ll post it at www.
askhowie.com/sonyaudio as a live link. A more complicated but free 
program is the open-source sound editor Audacity, available at http://
audacity.sourceforge.net. Audacity is also available in a Mac version.
Stick with two forms of online audio:
 
✓ Streaming audio: One format, used by Robert Middleton at www.
actionplan.com, is streaming audio that can be heard online but 
not saved or downloaded. It’s great for short clips, but a pain for long 
messages.
 
 You can use the inconvenience factor to your advantage, by offering a 
downloadable version of the streaming audio in exchange for contact 
information. You can also sell the same audio on your Web site as a 
shippable CD, but allow people to download it free. Knowing something 
has a price automatically increases the perceived value of a free item.
 
✓ MP3 files: The second format is the MP3 file, a format that can be 
played online through a player or downloaded and saved on a computer, 
where it can be synced with an iPod or other MP3 player. Think of your 
customers listening to your wisdom while driving in their cars or working 
out at the gym — what a rush!
 
Stay away from Real Media and Microsoft’s Windows Media as formats — their 
players annoy users with constant pop-ups and reminders to buy or upgrade. 
MP3 is a universal format that sounds great and plays on virtually all players.

272
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 
Video
As more and more Web users upgrade from dialup to broadband connections, 
the Internet is ready to serve as an interactive multimedia channel. YouTube 
has already trained us to watch video online. If you sell products, you can 
combine the visual and auditory richness of a QVC or infomercial with the 
click-to-buy immediacy of a Web page with AdWords’ ability to show the right 
message to the right person.
You can use video to demonstrate products, to show even more of your 
personality to your visitors, to display powerful testimonials, to chat with 
your market, and much more. With a decent video camera and good lighting, 
certain types of video content are almost as easy to create as text and audio.
How to use Web video to increase sales
by Joe Chapuis (www.webvideozone.
com)
Adding video to your Web site can help attract 
visitors, add value, and increase site visibility. 
But you’ve got to do it right. If you’re not care-
ful, putting video on your Web site can actually 
backfire, chasing people away and causing a 
lot of headaches for you in the process.
It’s never been easier to create and add video to 
your Web site. But just like with anything else, 
there is a learning curve, and there are pitfalls. 
Just because it can be done, doesn’t mean it 
should be done. You need to know when and 
where to use Web video — and when not to.
In addition, not everyone has the same programs 
and players on their computers. For example, 
if you produce all of your videos in QuickTime 
.mov format, people who don’t have (or want 
to use) QuickTime will never see your video.
Your goal should then be to create videos that 
are accessible to the greatest common denomi-
nator. You’ll want to make sure any video you 
offer is viewable to as many visitors as possible, 
while minimizing hassles and tech problems for 
your viewers.
And while it’s true that placing video on the 
Web is now quite easy, that doesn’t necessarily 
mean it’s always a good idea. Sometimes, your 
message can be better told using text with a 
few images. In other instances, an audio mes-
sage will suffice. Video isn’t the end-all solution 
for everything you have to say.
So before you rush into posting video on your 
Web site, consider these important points:
 1. Web video done poorly is worse than no 
video at all.
 
 This is especially true if your video clips 
don’t play properly, or if the quality of the 
video reflects poorly on you or your site. In 
these cases, it would be better not to use 
Internet video on your site.
 2. Internet video may not work for all visitors.
 
 Some Web surfers are still using Windows 
98 or older operating systems. Many of these 
older systems do not support the playing 
of video very well. One solution is to offer 
your video clips in as many different video 
formats as possible. Unfortunately, this 
can be a frustrating and time-consuming 
process for you.

273
 Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site
 3. Know your target market.
 
 Not everyone experiences the Internet the 
same way. People access the Web at very 
different connection speeds. While more 
than half of the U.S. Web-connected popu-
lation now enjoys a high-speed broadband 
experience (and for these people, video is 
no problem), there are still many people 
connecting via painfully slow telephone 
modems.
 
 By knowing who you are targeting, you 
can better determine if video makes sense 
for your site, as well as the best way to 
deploy it.
 4. Video requires a lot of storage space.
 
 On average, a one-minute video clip of aver-
age quality and resolution often requires 
at least 2MB of Web hosting space. If you 
offer that same clip in the six most popular 
formats, it is possible that you would need 
20MB of space — just for that one minute 
of video! And if you offer a total of 20 min-
utes of video, and provide it in all different 
formats, you could easily consume 400MB 
of Web space.
 5. Video is a bandwidth hog.
 
 If 100 people click to view your 5-minute 
video at the same time, they could jointly 
require and consume 2GB of bandwidth, 
all at the same time! Depending upon your 
hosting package, that alone could exceed 
your allocated monthly bandwidth.
 
 Imagine what would happen if 1,000 people 
clicked to view your 5-minute video . . . 
your Web host would likely crash, due to 
the inability to fulfill the huge bandwidth 
request. And your Web host won’t be very 
happy. And neither will you, when they send 
you their bill.
 6. Clicking away from your site and your 
Internet video is effortless.
 
 Even with the fastest Web connection, 
viewing high quality video on a computer 
monitor can be tedious — especially com-
pared to watching that same video on TV. 
For best results, Web video clips should 
be short (under three minutes) and to the 
point.
 
 Once the novelty wears off (and it will, 
once video becomes commonplace — very 
soon), people are going to be less willing to 
sit there and watch some idiot skateboard-
ing off his roof.
 
 In order to grab and hold attention, and get 
some kind of result, Internet video needs to 
be compelling, useful, and/or entertaining.
 7. Be careful when choosing an Internet video 
format.
 
 Whether the video you plan to offer is a 
computer screen tutorial, or live video foot-
age shot with a camcorder, you may want to 
offer your video in multiple formats, making 
it viewable by as many people as possible.
 
 But at the same time, too many choices may 
confuse and overwhelm your audience. In 
addition, there are time and cost consid-
erations for creating and deploying your 
videos. If you offer five different choices, 
you need to create and upload five differ-
ent videos. (And what happens if you need 
to make a change to the video?).
Joe Chapuis is the founder of www.web
videozone.com, which offers tools, tips, 
and tutorials to help businesses profit from 
Web video. Go to www.askhowie.com/

mats and methods of hosting video files, as well 
as his take on the right and wrong way to use

Saying “make yourself at home” with video
Online video can serve as a warm welcome to your Web site; a way to say 
hello, orient your visitor, and create an immediate emotional bond. If you 
think of your Web site as your home, and your visitors as, well, your visitors, 
you can open the door; smile; invite them in; take their coats; and offer them 
a chair, a cup of tea, and directions to the bathroom. Michael Katz accomplishes 
this with a short and charming video welcome at bluepenguindevelopment.
com. (It begins, “Hi, I’m Michael Katz, and if you’ve never seen what I look like 
before, let me just say, I share your disappointment.”)
Giving a shop tour with video
Josephine Canovas is a professional horse breeder and trainer in Spain. She 
sells Andalusian horses internationally. Obviously, most of her customers will 
not travel to her horse farm to view the horses and their living conditions. 
She uses video to show, rather than tell, about her horses and the care they 
receive. At www.andalusians-for-you.com/break-page-1.html you 
can view raw video of the stable and its daily happenings.
Running a Home Shopping Channel on your site
The Web boasts several significant advantages over TV shopping shows:
 
✓ The production costs are much lower.
 
✓ You are showing products to people who are searching for those 
products, rather than just channel surfing during commercials.
 
✓ Your visitors can program your channel to show the exact product 
they’re interested in right now, rather than wading through hours of 
knives and dehydrators to get to the levitating steamer basket.
 
✓ You can make money with small market items because you’re attracting 
high-quality traffic and you don’t have to keep paying to air your show.
 
✓ You can complete the transaction in the same medium as you’re selling. 
When you watch TV, you can’t buy the product using the TV — you need 
to pick up the phone.
At www.myweddingfavors.tv (shown in Figure 12-5), you can watch a 
home shopping–style show and choose among Beach Favors, Seasonal 
Favorites, Bridal Shower Favorites, and others. When the hosts show and 
describe an item, the Web page changes to display that item to the right of 
the video, along with buttons for More Info, E-mail a Friend, and Buy This 
Item.

Displaying customer testimonials
As marketing consultant Dan Hollings of www.danhollings.com says, “The 
most important thing a marketer can possess is a good review or testimonial, 
and there are only two reasons why you might not have a bounty of these 
on hand: 1) your product or service stinks or 2) you’re not asking.” A slew of 
video testimonials reassures your prospect that they aren’t going to be your 
guinea pig, that you have a history of success and happy customers.
To reassure meeting planners that I can deliver a great talk, I’ve compiled 
dozens of video testimonials at askhowie.com/videopraise. (See Figure 
12-6.) I collected them using a $100 Flip Video camera. After my talks, when 
people come up and say thanks, I whip out the camera and ask, “Could I

I coach them briefly (“Say your name, where you’re from, and one specific 
thing you found helpful.”) If they say no, I look extremely sad and start to

Teaching with video
Whatever your business, you have expertise that other people lack. When 
you make that expertise available online, you gain credibility as an expert 
helper, not just a self-interested peddler. Video offers the highest emotional 
bandwidth for your visitors to assess your knowledge and your character. 
Oliver Sachs wrote in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat about a group 
of patients in the aphasia ward who were laughing hysterically at a speech 
given by then-president Reagan. Although the patients had lost the ability 
to understand language, they ascertained he was lying by observing his 
facial expressions, gestures, and vocal tones and cadences. Just as video 
can destroy trust, it can also build trust when your goal is to be helpful and 
straight with your market.
The Kabbalah education site www.arionline.info features instructional 
videos that introduce the subject of Kabbalah and the instructors. Through 
music, spoken word, and moving images, the videos not only instruct but 
also elicit emotional reactions. Just as many of us have developed crushes on 
total strangers because we see them in Hollywood movies (I still have a thing 
for Amy Irving in Crossing Delancey, heaven help me), skillful video can create 
relationships with customers you haven’t met yet, and may never meet in 
person.

Recognizing and welcoming 
returning visitors with PHP
In Chapter 10, I show you how the PHP programming language can serve your 
visitors customized Web pages straight from the AdWords click. You can also 
use PHP to recognize returning visitors, so you can present them with relevant 
information and offers.
You’ve seen this in action if you’re an Amazon.com customer. You’re greeted 
by name, which is nice, but the really powerful application is the personalized 
recommendations based on your previous shopping history. In Figure 12-7, 
Amazon.com asks me whether I’m aware that it sells organic food. Actually, 
I wasn’t aware of it because I’ve never bought groceries from Amazon.com 
before. So how did it know/figure out/guess that I’m into healthy eating? 
Hmmm, do you think my prior purchases of Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding 
Kids Right, by Joel Fuhrman (St. Martin’s Griffin), and The China Study: 
The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling 
Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, and Long-Term Health, by T. Colin Campbell 
and Thomas M. Campbell II (Benbella Books), had anything to do with it?
 
Amazon.com uses its enormous database of customer behavior to make 
targeted offers. You can accomplish the same thing, on a much simpler scale, 
by engaging a PHP programmer to create a script that recognizes people 
who’ve visited your site before, and make the next offer. Rob Goyette of www.
howtomarketbetter.com gives the following example of a simple returning 
customer page headline for an online sporting goods store: “Welcome back, 
Howie, I hope you’re enjoying your new ping-pong table. Do you want to see 
our line of tournament-quality paddles and balls?”

Testing Your

In this part . . .
O
ne of my favorite things about the Internet is how 
cheaply and quickly I can fail — and how much I can 
learn from each failure. This part reveals simple strategies 
that virtually guarantee success if you implement them 
diligently, no matter how many failures you encounter.
Chapter 13 explains how to continually improve your ads 
by running multiple ads simultaneously and showing the 
different versions randomly to Google searchers. (Hint: 
Write two ads — Google does this automatically if you 
know how to change the default campaign settings.) 
Here’s where you also get a handle on split-testing pages 
on your Web site.
Chapter 14 continues the split-testing theme by introducing 
you to Google’s free Web Site Optimizer tool, which allows 
you to perform simple split tests and robust multivariate 
tests (in English: “really cool and powerful stuff”) to 
improve the performance of your Web site.
The immensely powerful AdWords conversion-tracking 
feature is covered in Chapter 15. I show you how to add 
code to your Web site so Google can tell you how much 
money you’re making or losing from every single ad and 
keyword. Armed with this intelligence, you can dramati-
cally improve profitability and reduce your AdWords 
spend.
In Chapter 16, I introduce Google Analytics, a comprehensive 
Web-site statistics program that ties in with AdWords to 
give you even more information about how to design an 
effective Web site.

M
ost people find that writing an effective AdWords ad is challenging. 
In the old days (2004, actually), advertisers found their ads swatted 
down constantly by the 0.5% CTR (click-through rate) threshold. That is, not 
even 5 in 1,000 searchers would click their ad, and Google felt that an ad so 
unattractive did not deserve to remain active.
The difficulty of successful ad creation is understandable — you have 130 
characters to convince someone to choose your offer over 19 other close-to-
identical listings on the same page. Plus, writing good ads is tough in the best 
of circumstances.
Perry Marshall gave a talk in which he demonstrated the need for split testing 
by challenging audience members — professional marketers all — to choose 
the more effective ad or headline from a series of 10 split tests. The best of 
us got no more than 4 or 5 out of 10 correct. As we held our hands up high 
and proud for having achieved 50 percent on the test, Perry shot us down: “If 
I had flipped a coin, I would have done as well as you. Congratulations. You 
guys are as smart as a penny.”
If you want to be smarter than a penny, you must apply the most powerful 
tool in the marketer’s arsenal: split testing.
In this chapter, I show you how to set up split testing with AdWords and analyze 
the results. I tell you about split-testing landing pages, as well as your entire sales 
process. Also, you discover only what you need to know about statistical signifi-
cance (which, in this case, relates to your confidence level that the split-testing 
results are repeatable) to make the best choices about your ads.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Capturing the Magic of Split Testing
Nothing leads to improvement faster than timely and clear feedback. While 
a million monkeys typing would eventually produce the entire works of 
Shakespeare, they would get there much faster if they got a banana every 
time they typed an actual word and an entire banana split when they man-
aged a rhymed couplet in iambic pentameter. (Can you tell I’ve been reading 
Shakespeare For Dummies, by John Doyle and Ray Lischner?) And for every 
nonword, someone would chuck a copy of Typing Shakespeare For Monkeys 
at them.
Now suppose the monkeys could keep and understand a written record of 
the characters that produced bananas, banana splits, and no reward. After a 
while, you would see more and more real words and Shakespearean phrasing, 
and fewer xlkjdfsdfsr. Ouch!
 
AdWords contains the world’s simplest mechanism for getting timely and 
clear feedback on your ads. You can create multiple ads, which AdWords 
shows to your prospects in equal rotation, and you can receive automatic 
and ongoing feedback.
Split testing is not an AdWords innovation — direct marketers have been test-
ing customers’ response rates since Moses got two tablets of commandments. 
Readers’ Digest used to choose headlines for its articles by sending postcards 
to readers, asking which articles they would be interested in reading in an 
upcoming issue. The list of articles was actually a list of headlines for the same 
article.
Here’s how split testing works in AdWords:
 
1. Run multiple ads simultaneously within a single ad group.
 
2. Monitor the effectiveness of all ads at eliciting the customer response 
you want.
 
 Continue monitoring until one of those ads has proven itself better at its 
calling.
 
3. Declare the proven ad the winner (or, in marketing geek-speak, the 
control).
 
4. Retire the less successful ad, replace it with a new challenger, and 
repeat the contest.
 
 If the challenger does better, it becomes the new control. If the control 
maintains supremacy, you send a different challenger up against it.

283
 Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius
 
The beauty of this split-testing system is that you can’t help but improve your 
results over time. If a new ad proves worse than your control, simply delete it. 
And the added beauty is that you don’t even have to know what you’re doing 
to improve your ad’s effectiveness. While market intelligence, creativity, and 
writing skill help, mere trial and error — when funneled through split testing — 
can boost your results significantly.
One of my early AdWords projects was an ad for a direct-marketing home-
study course for small businesses (see the series of ads in Figure 13-1). An 
early ad, headlined “Cold calling — now illegal,” achieved a 0.7% CTR. The 
final ad I used — “Cold calling not working?” — nearly quadrupled that with 
a 2.7% CTR. The big lesson from this long series of ads is this: I had no idea 
what I was doing at the time, yet I still succeeded. Take a few minutes and 
examine each of the ads carefully. Be honest — could you predict which of 
these ads would do better than the rest? I couldn’t. I still can’t. But the num-
bers don’t lie, and I was able to turn a marginal product into a success thanks 
to split testing.

Conducting Split Testing with AdWords
Split-testing with AdWords follows the four-step process outlined in the pre-
ceding section. You can prepare yourself to launch a series of split-testing 
ads by getting curious about what messages will be most compelling to your 
prospects. Turn each message into an ad and get ready to have fun.
Creating a challenger ad
Creating your second ad is even easier than creating your first (see Chapter 3 
for step-by-step instructions):
 
1. From the Campaigns tab, click the Ads rollup tab group name to see a 
list of all the ads in your account.
 
2. Click the Ad Group name to the right of the ad you wish to challenge.
 
3. Click the New Ad button just above and to the left of the list of ads.
 
4. Choose Text Ad from the drop-down list.
 
 An ad template with sample copy appears on-screen, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.

285
 Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius
 
5. Type over the existing copy and URL with your challenger ad’s copy 
and URL.
 
6. Click the Save Ad button.
After your challenger ad is in place, you want to make sure that your two 
ads will compete fairly. Google assumes you’re too busy (or lazy) to moni-
tor your split tests, so the default setting is for AdWords to show the ad with 
the higher CTR more, and gradually let the poorer-performing ad slip into 
oblivion.
 
You want to override this setting for two reasons:
 
✓ An ad with a lower CTR may still be the more profitable ad (see Chapter 
15 for details of this apparent paradox).
 
✓ When you let AdWords evaluate the ads without your supervision, you 
don’t learn anything that makes you a smarter advertiser. The faster you 
declare winning and losing ads, the faster your marketing improves.
Here’s how you override the AdWords default setting that may kill an ad with-
out your approval. (Note: You establish this setting on the campaign level, so 
you may need to do this with each campaign.)
 
1. From the Campaigns tab, click the Campaigns rollup tab to generate a 
list of all campaigns in your account.
 
2. Check the name of the campaign you wish to edit.
 
3. Click the Settings rollup tab.
 
 A page with various campaign-level settings appears.
 
4. Scroll down to Advanced Settings at the very bottom of the page, and 
click the Edit link next to Ad Rotation.
 
 If you can’t find the Ad Rotation setting, you may have to open the Ad 
delivery section by clicking the Ad Delivery: Ad Rotation, Ad Frequency 
Link at the bottom of the page.
 
5. Click the radio button next to Rotate: Show ads more evenly.
 
6. Click the Save button at the bottom of the Campaign Settings page.
Now you’re split-testing properly. Once you install conversion tracking (see 
Chapter 15), you have the ability to compare the profitability of your ads. 
Until then, the only thing you can compare is the CTR.
 
If you ever deploy Google’s Conversion Optimizer tool on a campaign, you 
must revert to the default option, where Google shows your better performing 
ads more often.

286
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Monitoring the split test
Just as you wouldn’t put a cake in a 350° F oven and not pay attention to 
when it was done, you wouldn’t set up a split test and then ignore the results. 
You have three ways to check up on your cake to make sure it doesn’t burn 
and the fork comes out clean:
 
✓ Haphazardly: Check up on your cake when you think of it. As long as 
you catch it before the smoke alarm does, the cake might turn out okay.
 
✓ Annoyingly: Set your watch to beep every few minutes to remind you to 
check the cake.
 
✓ Geekily: Install a sensor in the oven that alerts you when the cake is done.
These three methods are available for monitoring your AdWords split tests 
as well:
 
✓ With the haphazard method, you can look at each ad group once a 
day, once every three days, once a week, whenever Dartmouth wins a 
football game, and so on. The interval you choose should relate to the 
amount of traffic your ads are getting. For example, if you get 50 clicks 
per day, you might want to check your ads every day. A huge stream of 
traffic will give you a winner much quicker than a trickle, all other things 
being equal. But even if your traffic is massive, wait at least a couple of 
days before declaring a winner. Visitors checking out your ad at three 
o’clock in the morning on Sunday are likely to be very different from 
Monday afternoon visitors. You want to collect a representative sample 
to be sure your results are accurate.
 
✓ With the annoying, repetitive method, you can create reports within 
AdWords and schedule those reports (see Chapter 15).
 
✓ With the geeky, pass-the-buck method, you can subscribe to a third-
party service that monitors all your split tests and e-mails you when you 
have a winner (see the section, “Automating your testing with Winner 
Alert” later in this chapter).
Declaring a winner
Okay, so you’re watching your split tests with eagle eyes and keen concentra-
tion. How do you know when one ad has outperformed another? After all, as 
the investment ads say, “Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results.” 
Fortunately, the testing process is simple and straightforward when you’re 
running a single test of two different ads. You just want to answer the ques-
tion, “Is this result real, or just a random coincidence?” That’s where your 
friend and mine — statistical significance — makes a welcome appearance.

287
 Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius
Understanding statistical significance
If I flip a coin twice and it lands heads both times, should I assume that coin 
would always come up heads? Of course not — two flips do not give me 
enough data to reach that conclusion. What about four flips, all heads? Less 
likely, but still plausible? What about ten flips, all heads? Are we getting a 
tad suspicious now? It could still be due to random chance — after all, every 
single flip of a fair coin has an equal chance of landing heads or tails — or, 
possibly, this is no fair coin. If I get to 20, 30, or 100 flips with no tails in sight, 
I can be pretty sure something’s up.
In your AdWords split testing, you’re looking for information that will tell 
you that something’s up. You want to know that one ad is truly better than 
another, and that the difference in CTR is not because of randomness. Just 
as with the coin, you can never know for absolute certain. Statistical signifi-
cance tells you the probability that you’re making the right choice.
Testing for significance
If you’re doing it yourself, here are the steps to assessing the significance of 
your results and deciding whether to declare a winner:
 
1. From your AdWords account, click through to the Ad Group you want 
to test.
 
2. Click the Ad Variations tab, and write down the following numbers:
 
• Number of clicks for Ad #1
 
• Impressions for Ad #1
 
• Number of clicks for Ad #2
 
• Impressions for Ad #2
 
3. Go to www.askhowie.com/split and enter the four numbers in the 
appropriate fields.
 
4. Look at your confidence interval and see whether you have a winner.
I’m willing to accept a 95% threshold for my split testing. I can live with the 
knowledge that 1 out of every 20 split tests is giving me a bogus sense of confi-
dence. Below that, I want to keep running the test until I achieve significance or 
until I’m satisfied that there really is no difference between the two ads.
What if you have no winner?
Say you’re testing two ads, and they’re running neck and neck for days. Weeks. 
Months. In this case, you’re losing money by continuing the test. Sure, at some 
point, the data might tip one way or the other, but the simple fact is the differ-
ence isn’t going to be important in real life. Drop the challenger (keeping the 
control makes sense because it has more history behind it) and get a new 
challenger. Pull the plug on a test when each ad has at least 100 clicks.

288
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Mechanics of Split Testing in AdWords
Because of the way Google assigns quality scores to keyword/ad combina-
tions, you need to make sure you’re giving your challenger ads a fair chance. 
Google, like most people, prefers old friends to new acquaintances. This 
means that an ad that’s been running for a while and doing well (meaning, 
good CTR and clearly relevant) will have a higher quality score than a new 
ad. Therefore, the control ad will display in a higher position, which gives it 
an artificial boost in CTR. So, you may incorrectly keep a control ad because 
of its unfair advantage.
The solution is to create a copy of the control ad and test it against the chal-
lenger. Both ads start out with zero impressions and an assumption of equal 
quality. Even though the copy is an exact clone of the control ad, Google 
doesn’t recognize it as an old friend. Therefore, your split test will compare 
the ads fairly, allowing you to choose the real winner.
While you’re at it, I recommend creating three copies of your control ad, 
not just one. That way, you get to show your control ad (that is, the one you 
know is working the best) to 80 percent of searchers, rather than 50 per-
cent. Think about it — would you trust half your business to a new, totally 
untested salesperson? By creating multiple copies of the control ad, you’re 
reducing your risk in case the new ad is a total failure. (See Figure 13-3.)
 
Figure 13-3: 
The control 
ad (top) 
achieved a 
much higher 
CTR than 
its three 
identical 
clones 
because 
of a 
better 
Quality 
Score.
 
Also, as Richard Mouser of www.scientificwebsitetesting.com points 
out, the different CTRs of the three identical copies of the control ad will 
converge at the point of statistical significance. So if you have three identical 
copies at CTRs of 3.1%, 1.6%, and 0.8%, then you know instantly you haven’t 
run the test long enough to be confident in the results.

289
 Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius
Strategies for Effective Split Testing
Many AdWords beginners understand the concept of split testing, but do it 
haphazardly and without strategy. They learn that split testing is too con-
fusing and complicated, and give up on the most powerful weapon in their 
marketing arsenal. The following sections discuss three strategies to assure a 
streamlined and effective split-testing process.
1. Start wide, get narrow
When you begin to split-test in an ad group, choose two very different ads. 
You may want to focus on different markets (stay-at-home dads versus 
divorced/widowed dads with full custody), different emotional responses 
(greed versus fear), or different benefits (lose weight versus prevent heart 
disease). Get the big picture right before drilling down to the details. It does 
you no good to test easy versus simple in a headline if your prospects don’t 
care about ease or simplicity, but just whether it can run on batteries.
After you discover the right market, key benefits, and the emotional hot but-
tons of that market, you can start testing more specific elements (see the 
upcoming section, “Generating Ideas for Ad Testing”).
2. Keep track of your tests
Remember high school chemistry class? You had to buy a marble notebook 
and keep track of all your experiments, including date, hypothesis, experi-
ment design, and results.
Chances are that your bright ideas about ad testing are not new. If you don’t 
keep track somehow, you’ll find yourself repeating experiments to which you 
already know the answer. Keeping track of your results in a marble notebook, 
or its digital equivalent (a Word document, private blog, or Excel spread-
sheet), is therefore crucial to moving forward efficiently.
3. Split-testing is just asking questions
Split-testing can become so mechanical, it’s easy to forget the purpose is to 
make you smarter by learning what makes your customers tick — er, click.
Perry Marshall distinguishes between true market research and what he 
calls “opinion research.” Opinion research is what people say they’ll do. 
Market research is what they actually do. Split testing is a powerful form 

290
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
of market research that will provide answers to whatever questions you ask. 
As computer programmers are fond of saying, “Garbage In, Garbage Out.” If 
you ask intelligent questions, you’ll get useful answers.
So before you run a split test, take a moment to write down (in your lab note-
book, of course) the question you want your prospects to answer for you. 
Then design a split test that asks that question.
The following figures show some examples of good questions and the split 
tests that were set up to answer them:
How much traffic do I give up if I put the price of the product in the ad? (See 
Figure 13-4.)
 
Figure 13-4: 
Including 
the price in 
an ad cuts 
my traffic 
in half.
 
Will positioning my product as a “professional shares his secrets” increase 
clicks, compared to flagging the benefit of family fun? (See Figure 13-5.)
 
Figure 13-5: 
The “pro-
tells-all” 
approach 
is a clear 
winner.
 
Generating Ideas for Ad Testing
You want to test broadly different ideas before getting into details. Don’t worry 
about whether description line 2 should have a comma in it before you’ve fig-
ured out the answers to your big questions. Imagine that you’re searching for 
the most delicious plum in the world. First, you test the orchard to make sure 

291
 Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius
it has plum trees and not orange trees. When you find the plum orchard, start 
testing trees to find the tree with the best plums. When you find the best tree, 
see whether you prefer the plums near the top or closer to the ground. On the 
north or the south side. Then taste the fruit on different limbs, and after you 
find the most promising limb, see which branch yields the best fruit.
David Bullock’s (www.davidbullock.com) list of big questions from 
Chapter 6 comes in handy here:
 
✓ Who is looking?
 
✓ What are they looking for?
 
✓ Why are they looking for it?
 
✓ What will be the result of their search?
 
✓ What does the searcher want the ultimate outcome to be?
 
✓ What is the emotional good feeling they seek?
 
✓ What emotional outcome are they trying to avoid?
 
✓ Who does the searcher care about?
 
✓ What does the searcher care about?
In other words, split-test the ads to discover the demographics and psycho-
graphics of your market. Who are they — working mothers or single profes-
sionals taking care of aging parents? What big benefit are they looking for 
in your product — saving time or assuaging guilt? Are they angry with their 
company or do they feel grateful? Who do they want to help them with this 
problem — Walter Cronkite or Jon Stewart?
Use your split tests to answer these questions as best you can. Write down a 
hypothesis and brainstorm two ads that will prove or disprove it. After you 
test the big ideas, turn your attention to the little things that can make a big 
difference:
 
✓ Order of lines: If you’re highlighting the benefit on line 1 and explaining 
a feature on line 2, try switching the order of the two lines.
 
✓ Display URLs: If you buy a bunch of domain names related to your main 
domain, you can point them all to the same Web site and test which 
domain name attracts the right customers. If you have the .com and 
.org for the same domain, will one outperform the other?
 
✓ Capitalization: Finding the right capitalization of your URL to make 
its meaning stand out is an art form. For example, I found that 
LeadsintoGold.com did better than leadsintogold.com in almost 
every test.

292
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
✓ Synonyms: Try variations of your benefits: simple/easy/quick/no sweat.
 
✓ Punctuation: Perry Marshall talks about the cadence of an ad — the 
way the searchers hear it in the mind’s ear can subtly influence whether 
they resonate with it. Use punctuation to make the phrase more melodic 
and persuasive. Figure 13-6 shows what happened when I used a comma 
to put the emphasis on You rather than Instead:
 
Figure 13-6: 
In this split 
test, a 
comma 
quadruples 
the CTR.
 
The ad with the comma is four times as effective as the other one. Without test-
ing, there’s no way I would have predicted the effect would be so profound.
Tools for Split Testing
With the proper tools, split testing can be the most powerful tactic in your 
entire marketing strategy. The following tools allow you to split test faster to 
improve faster.
Automating your testing with Winner Alert
My AdWords account is quite large at this point. I have 27 separate cam-
paigns. Many of the campaigns include dozens of ad groups. Each of these 
groups is running a split test pretty much all the time. I probably have to 
monitor well over 100 split tests simultaneously. If I were to go into each ad 
group, pull out the data, and enter it into a statistical significance calculator, 
it would take me the better part of a day just to assess the tests. And that 
doesn’t even include the time it takes me to think up new ad variations to 
challenge the winners.

293
 Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius
If you’re just starting out and you’re running fewer than 10 ad groups at a 
time, you won’t feel my pain. But after your campaigns grow, you’ll either 
stop tracking the results of your tests or you’ll wait too long to find winners. 
Wait too long and you’re ignoring profit-growing market data and showing 
prospects suboptimal ads.
 
To help alleviate this problem, I created a Winner Alert tool that automates 
the process of tracking statistical significance, and e-mails you whenever one 
of your split tests produces a winner. It’s a great tool, and when you’re ready 
for it, you can try it free for a month. Go to www.askhowie.com/winner for 
video demos and your coupon code.
Turbocharging your testing with Taguchi
The Taguchi Method lets you test hundreds of variations in a fraction of the 
time it would take if you used a standard A-B split. It’s not for beginners; 
the methodology is so complicated, it’s easy to fall into the Garbage-In-
Garbage-Out trap and believe you have the answer to Life, the Universe, and 
Everything because the printout looks so impressive.
 
You should consider Taguchi testing if and only if your keywords get at least 
several thousand daily impressions each, and if the person setting up your 
test has experience using Taguchi for marketing. Taguchi testing was originally 
developed to reduce manufacturing errors, and many practitioners misapply 
a manufacturing mindset to the marketing process. David Bullock is the pre-
miere Taguchi marketer who applies the method to AdWords. You can find an 
article he wrote to protect you from incorrect and unnecessary use of Taguchi 
at www.askhowie.com/taguchi.
Split-Testing Web Pages
Although you can split-test other elements of your Web site using ad split 
testing (for example, running two visually identical ads with different destina-
tion URLs), you get better results by using Google’s free Web Site Optimizer 
tool (see Chapter 14 for details).

n the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays a surly, cynical weather-
man fated to relive the same day — February 2 in Punxsutawney, 
Pennsylvania — over and over again. Along the way, he learns to sculpt 
ice, play piano, and dance. Eventually, he falls in love with his producer, 
played by Andie McDowell. In his quest to win her heart, Murray’s character 
fails repeatedly to impress and attract her. But he learns from every failure 
and adapts his behavior, until he has transformed himself into a suave, 
considerate, and heroic companion. 
When you split-test pages on your Web site, you can accomplish the same 
sort of trial-and-error adaptation with your visitors and prospects, without 
having to spend quasi-eternity in Pennsylvania. Your tool of choice, compli-
ments of Google, is the free, powerful, and elegant Website Optimizer.
Website Optimizer allows you to test different variations of your Web pages 
to see which ones give you more of the results you want. Will your visitors 
respond better to a product photo, video, or testimonial in a given region of 
the page? Will more people buy if you offer a 50 percent discount or a two-
for-one sale? Should your headline read, “Natural Soaps for All Occasions” or 
“You Probably Stink”?
Testing, part of the DNA of direct marketing, has been practiced for well over 
100 years. In the old days, advertisers would test direct mail campaigns at 
a cost of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, and would get results 
months after initiating the test. On the Web, you can generate the same 
quality of data with a few minutes of setup and a few days or weeks of data

gathering. Most site owners never test, so they never discover that they’re 
missing 50 percent to 100 percent increases in sales — and that range is 
conservative, because you won’t believe the real possibilities until you 
experience them for yourself.
In this chapter, I borrow heavily from the expertise of Richard Mouser, testing 
genius and proprietor of www.scientificwebsitetesting.com. Richard 
launched an e-commerce site, www.mrwaterfilter.com, in 2004, and tested 
his way from losing money to becoming highly profitable in a very competitive 
market, home water filters. Richard and I guide you to create a testing strategy, 
set up tests, analyze the results, and take action to produce more effective and 
profitable Web sites. Richard should get credit for all the good information in 
this chapter. But all the bad jokes are mine.
Deciding What to Test
Website Optimizer makes it so easy to set up and run tests, you may be 
tempted to jump right in before doing the necessary planning and prepara-
tion. So before I show you how to crank your testing engine, I talk about how 
to develop a strategy that gets you going in the right direction. The first step 
is to figure out what to test.
Here’s the problem: Your landing page consists of dozens of different ele-
ments — headlines, subheads, body copy, navigation bars, images, fonts, 
color schemes, and on and on — and each can be changed in practically infi-
nite ways. If you were to test each element randomly, you’d feel like a monkey 
at a keyboard aiming to produce King Lear. It would take forever, you’d have 
no guarantee of ever getting there, and you’d develop a nasty case of simian 
carpal tunnel syndrome.
And, you’ve already created the best site you could build. So where can you 
go for new ideas?
Testing Principle #1: Start big, get smaller
In Chapter 13, you see some examples of very tiny changes in ad copy that 
lead to very different results. The addition of a comma increased my CTR 
four times! So you might think that similar small changes would work for site 
testing as well. Generally, they don’t. Instead, go for giant differences. That 
way, you’ll get clearer results faster.
For example, you may want to find out if your visitors will respond better to 
a video or a still image at the top of the page. That’s a big difference. Do they 
prefer a short page or a long page? A professional-looking site or one that 
could have been put together by your nephew in about 15 minutes?

297
 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
After you answer the big questions, you can look at the nuances and details. 
But if your first tests are showing no difference in results, the difference 
between options A and B aren’t big enough to matter.
Testing Principle #2: Tests 
are just questions in action
Maybe you still have flashbacks to 11th grade chemistry class, where you 
had to write down hypotheses and experimental methods in your marble 
notebook, and then try to avoid setting your hair on fire with a Bunsen 
burner? If so, please relax when it comes to scientific Web site testing. 
Running a test is just asking a question and inviting your visitors to answer 
with their actions.
One of my tests started with the question, “How much do the visitors to this 
page know about me already?” Do I need to spend time introducing myself 
and establishing credibility by telling them I’m my mother’s favorite AdWords 
author or cut right to the chase and entice them to purchase the Look Over 
My Shoulder AdWords Video Series?
My test had to put that question into action, by creating an option that 
assumed familiarity and an option that didn’t. I created two pages, cleverly 
named Long and Short. The long page introduced me in depth before getting 
down to business, and the short page started talking about their situation 
and why watching short online videos was the answer to their prayers.
Testing Principle #3: Test 
to overcome objections
While you brainstorm questions to turn into tests, familiarize yourself to all 
the reasons your visitors aren’t doing what you want. Is it too hard? That is, 
do you have a usability issue of complicated menus, cumbersome forms, and 
hidden buttons? Or are visitors unpersuaded? If so, you need to work on the 
elements that create comfort, build credibility, and describe relevant and 
desirable benefits.
Karl Blanks and Ben Jesson of www.conversion-rate-experts.com make 
this simple with their objection/counter-objection approach. First, you deter-
mine the likely objection. Then, make changes that address that objection.
For example, if the objection is, “I don’t trust you or your company enough 
to buy something or give you my contact information,” then you add trust 
elements such as endorsements; photos of your staff, office or warehouse; 
years in business; Hacker Safe seals, and so on.

298
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
If they can’t differentiate your product from your competitors’, then test 
elements that show the advantages of your product. If they’re afraid of 
making a mistake, introduce and test risk-reduction strategies, such as a 
free trial or money-back guarantee.
In other words, don’t focus your testing on the elements of your site (“Red 
or blue headline here?”). Focus on what the users need in order to feel good 
about doing what you want them to do.
Testing Principle #4: Look 
for things that don’t work
Testing isn’t always about finding things that work better. Sometimes you 
learn more when your great idea falls flat. Instead of shaking your head and 
saying, “Well, that bombed,” get an inquisitive look in your eyes and ask, 
“Now why didn’t my visitors go for that?”
That question gets you out of your head and into the heads of your visitors — 
the people who are interacting with your site in an attempt to achieve a personal 
goal. When you understand what your visitors don’t like, and what gets in their 
way, you can apply that knowledge to the rest of your marketing — online 
and off.
When you test, you’re developing your instincts for what works and what 
doesn’t work. Over time, this is where testing really pays off. By experiencing 
success and failure, you gain insight into your market and become better at 
creating effective promotions for them.
Creating a Testing Plan
After you generate your testing ideas, your “I wonder . . .” questions, and the 
likely objections, you can build your testing plan. Richard recommends three 
simple steps to get you started (and hooked on) testing.
 
1. Make a list of things you want to test.
 
2. Prioritize that list.
 
3. Start testing and keep adding to the list based on test results.
The next few sections discuss these steps in detail.

299
 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
Making your list of things to test
You might not feel like you have any ideas that are worth testing at this point, 
but don’t worry. You just need to start getting ideas down on paper regard-
less of whether the ideas are good.
If you follow this process, you’ll end up with more ideas than you have time 
to test and you’ll never stop adding to your list. The most promising ideas 
will bubble to the top of your list, your Web site will get a little better with 
each test, and your marketing skills will get sharper in the process.
One important thing, carry around a piece of paper or an index card to cap-
ture ideas. Inspiration comes at the strangest times; you don’t want to forget 
a good idea.
Richard’s story
When I launched my first Web site, www.
mrwaterfilter.com, I was just seeing 
whether I could successfully drive traffic to an 
e-commerce site by using AdWords. I didn’t 
want to spend a lot of money on the site. One 
thing I skimped on was security, or credibility 
seals. The seals were expensive at the time, so 
I didn’t want to spend the money without being 
sure that I could generate sales without them.
I started making sales as soon as I turned on 
the AdWords traffic, but I was losing money 
with an initial conversion rate of 1.2 percent. 
Because the site was making some sales, I 
decided to take the plunge and test credibility 
seals on the site, and my sales conversion rate 
improved to 1.5 percent almost immediately. 
That may not sound like much, but it made the 
difference from losing money to making money. 
It was the first time I tasted blood and saw that 
testing could actually work.
My graphic artist misunderstood some instruc-
tions of mine and created a header that wasn’t 
what I wanted. I was disappointed, but I let the 
design stand because I was in a hurry to take 
the site live. But when I got around to testing my 
original concept, sales increased. So good-bye 
artist’s rendition.
Sometimes testing went the other way. I knew 
that making the first part of each bullet point 
bold was tasteful and effective. It drew the eye 
to the key points that would help visitors decide 
to buy. Except that when I tested it, I was dead 
wrong. Bold text suppressed sales. So despite 
my love of a well-placed bit o’ bold text, I use 
almost no bold on the site today.
My sales conversion rate from AdWords traf-
fic is 5.5 percent. Actually, it’s higher than 
that, because I’m not yet tracking phone sales. 
But the big lesson is that it’s rare to be profit-
able with AdWords right from the start. If the 
only modifications you make are to ads and 
keywords, you’re missing the lion’s share of 
profits.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Think back to when you launched your Web site
In the frenzy of getting a Web site built, there are always compromises. No 
one has the time to create the perfect Web site on the first try. And even if 
you had all the time and money in the world, how could you possibly know 
for sure what “perfect” would look like?
Take a deep breath, follow my pocket watch swinging back and forth, and feel 
your mind free-floating back, back, back to when you were creating your site 
and thought:
“OK, that’s good enough for now.”
“Not exactly what I had in mind, but I guess it works.”
“We don’t have time to do it over again.”
Browse your site to jog your memory. Look for areas of compromise, of 
“Good enough for now,” or “Gee, I hope that works.” Make a list of every ele-
ment that just maybe could improve.
Getting inspired by your competition
Next, take a good look at your competitors’ sites. Compare their landing 
pages to yours. Ask yourself:
 
✓ What are they doing better than I am? Do they have better copy, head-
lines, pictures, design, or something else? Can I use their site as a tem-
plate on which to improve?
 
✓ What’s on their site, but missing from mine? Can I test adding that?
 
✓ What’s on my site, but missing from theirs? Can I test removing that?
 
✓ Is their site more focused on the customer, the customer problem, or the 
solution?
 
✓ Does their site seem more credible or professional than mine?
 
✓ Do they have more elements or different elements above the fold (visible 
without scrolling) than my site? Could I test these changes?
 
✓ Does their site deliver on the promise made in their AdWords ad?
 
✓ Is their checkout or sign-up process more intuitive and easier to follow 
than mine?
Your competition can give you lots of ideas on what to improve, what to add, 
and what to remove from your Web site. Sometimes you can find good ideas 
by studying and modeling your competitors. But don’t assume something is 
good just because someone else is doing it — most online markets consist of 
the clueless copying the clueless. Until you test, be skeptically curious.

301
 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
For example, Richard noticed that his competitors showed only the manufac-
turer’s stock photos. In many cases, the pictures weren’t even sized correctly, 
so they appeared stretched and grainy in visitors’ Web browsers.
Richard replaced his stock photos with high-quality photos that he took, 
using an inexpensive light box and a digital camera. Even though the water 
filters he sells are in many cases identical to those sold by competitors, he 
achieves a competitive advantage by making it easier for his customers to 
visualize and evaluate the products. When Richard surveys his customers, 
they consistently tell him that good, clear pictures are an important factor in 
their decision to buy from him.
Asking your visitors and customers
Your visitors and customers can provide a wealth of information on how to 
improve your Web site. 
Here are a few things you should put in place to gather information from your 
visitors:
 
✓ Google Analytics to track visitors and sales, compare bounce rates on 
various pages, learn how users progress through your sales process, 
and more. See Chapter 13 for more information about Google Analytics.
 
✓ A high profile, easy way for visitors to ask questions (see Figure 14-1). 
This lets you know the questions you need to answer with your Web 
site. This also provides you with words that customers use when talking 
about your product or service.
 
✓ Surveys to determine visitor needs or satisfaction with your Web site. 
Surveys can give you an overview of what people are trying to accom-
plish on your Web site and how satisfied they are with your site.
 
Figure 14-1: 
MrWater
Filter.com 
encourages 
visitors 
to ask 
questions 
by soliciting 
them at the 
top left of 
every page.
 

302
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Visit 4Q at http://4q.iperceptions.com for a free survey tool that’s 
easy to install and configure. You’ll be amazed at the valuable information 
you can get from a simple four-question survey. Your visitors will tell you — 
if you let them — what they like and dislike about your site and how you can 
change it to make them happier.
With the information from the above tools, you can start to ask interesting 
questions, create some theories, and then test those theories. For example:
 
✓ If you find a high percentage of survey respondents are attempting one 
task and they have a lower satisfaction than visitors attempting other tasks, 
you should focus some testing in that area.
 
✓ If you find that visitors consistently ask a particular set of questions, 
you might test answering those questions on the product page or in a 
Frequently Asked Questions section (hence the name) or article with 
prominent links to your product page.
 
✓ If you find that there are fewer sales from one of your high traffic pages 
than from other lower traffic pages, you should test some changes to 
the high traffic page. Analytics allow you to focus your effort where the 
biggest payoff is possible.
All this combines to create a steady stream of information from and about 
your visitors. Evaluate that information to design tests that look for ways to 
serve your visitors better.
Here’s an example. By running a 4Q survey, Richard found that 47 percent of 
his visitors to the shower water filter page wanted to compare products, and 
that they were considerably less satisfied with their experience on the site 
than were people attempting other tasks, such as checking prices or making 
a purchase. The survey revealed an opportunity to improve those visitors’ 
ability to compare products. So Richard is now testing ways to allow compar-
ison shopping for that category. He uses visitor and customer data to drive 
continuous improvement of his site.
Prioritizing your list
After you set up tools to capture information about visitors and use that 
information to generate ideas to test, it’s time to grade each idea so you can 
prioritize the tests based on expected ROI. You move the ideas with the high-
est grades to the top of the list and test them first.

303
 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
Apply the following 11 criteria to each item you’re thinking of testing. The items 
that receive the most checks rise to the top of your testing list. These represent 
your first tests. (In case of a tie, I recommend flipping a coin — I like the 2005 
Oregon quarter with a picture of Crater Lake, but that’s totally up to you.)
 
✓ The item is on a high traffic page.
 
✓ The test result, if positive, can be applied to other pages on the site.
 
✓ The item is above the fold (that is, most visitors can see it without 
having to scroll down or sideways).
 
✓ The item is the most prominent feature on the page.
 
✓ The item relates to a high leverage conversion, such as an opt-in or first 
sale. (High leverage items in most businesses are gateways to multiple 
purchases and customer loyalty.)
 
✓ The item addresses a frequent customer question or problem.
 
✓ This item affects all customer sales (as part of the checkout process, for 
example).
 
✓ The item fills a competitive gap.
 
✓ The item enhances the credibility of your site.
 
✓ The item contributes to your site’s uniqueness.
 
✓ The new version of the item is very different from what is shown on 
your site.
This exercise provides you with a prioritized list of what to test on your site. 
When you come up with new ideas, add them to the list, but be sure to re-
prioritize before you select the next item to test.
Start testing (and never stop)
Are you ready to pull the top idea off the list and start testing? First, you need 
to create the resource to test. You already have your original, that’s your 
A version. Now put together your B version. You might have to write some 
copy, create an image or video, and get some HTML code to tie it all into a 
working page. Upload that page to your site, and commence testing!
 
When you’re testing elements of your marketing, you’re acting like a scientist. 
Don’t just ask questions; ask clear questions in an elegant way so the answers 
mean what you think they mean. Exclude other variables so that the only 
reason for the difference in outcome is the different inputs you controlled. 

304
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Also, run the test enough times to reduce the effects of random chance. 
Finally, don’t stick the end of a Bunsen burner hose onto a sink faucet instead 
of the methane gas supply. Although hilarious, it also got me suspended.
Here are four rules to help you achieve useful and valid test results:
 
1. Test one thing at a time.
 
 If you test the headline font and header graphic simultaneously in an A/B 
split test, you won’t know which element mattered and which element 
didn’t. (You can test multiple synergistic effects using the more complicated 
(and therefore left out of this For Dummies book to keep your blood 
pressure down) Multivariate Testing. Visit http://askhowie.com/
multivariate when you’re ready for some advanced testing methods.
 
2. Repeat each test to be sure.
 
 If you have enough traffic, engage in the luxurious practice of validating 
your tests by running them a second time. Website Optimizer makes this 
one-click simple (keep reading this chapter to find out how).
 
3. Keep traffic streams separate.
 
 Each ad group should send visitors to a unique landing page, so when 
you’re testing elements on that page, you’re looking at how a specific 
market segment interacts with it. If you send all your traffic to a single 
page, you will almost certainly miss chances to optimize the page for 
different groups of people. If all of Richard’s AdWords traffic went to his 
home page, for example, he would not be able to optimize the page for 
people searching for shower water filters in order to compare products.
 
4. Identify a measurable outcome.
 
 Sure, you want your Web site to be better, but what exactly does better 
mean? To conduct tests, you have to operationalize better into some 
visitor behavior that you can see and count. If you collect leads on your 
site, one measure of a landing page is how well it turns visitors into 
leads. Another measure is sales. You might also count downloads of soft-
ware or marketing documents, or views of a key page.
To use Website Optimizer, you must identify a page on your site that visitors 
arrive at after they convert — that is, after they take the action you want 
them to take. Just to make things really clear, I’ll call this the thank-you page. 
Two things must be true for the test to be valid:
 
✓ Every visitor who converts must make it to your thank-you page.
 
✓ No visitor who doesn’t convert can make it to your thank-you page.

 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
Testing with Google Website Optimizer
Here’s the step-by-step method for setting up your first experiment in Google 
Website Optimizer (GWO, which sounds like Elmer Fudd encouraging his plants).
 
1. Start GWO.
 
 You don’t need AdWords to use GWO, but Google provides a handy link 
right in the AdWords menu bar. (See Figure 14-2.)
 
Figure 14-2: 
Get to 
GWO from 
within your 
AdWords 
account.
 
 
 If you haven’t set up your AdWords account but you want to begin test-
ing anyway, visit www.google.com/websiteoptimizer and log in 
with your Google account.
 
 After you log in, Google requires that you specify your location and time 
zone and then agree to GWO’s terms of service.
 
 The first GWO page you see is the Experiment List page. Naturally, no 
experiments are listed, so let’s fix that right away.
 
2. Click the Create Experiment link at the bottom of the Experiment List 
box to get started. (See Figure 14-3.)
 
3. Choose the type of experiment you’ll be running.
 
 The choices are an A/B Experiment (a simple two-option split test) or a 
Multivariate Experiment (where multiple elements of the page are tested 
at one time).
 
 Select an A/B Experiment, in which you create one or more variations of 
your page and compare results of each to the original. (See Figure 14-4.) 
This is the simplest experiment to create and understand, so it’s a good 
place to start. Even when you become a testing ninja, you’ll want to 
start improving a page with A/B tests because they give you big answers 
quickly. After you feel comfortable with A/B experiments, you can visit 
http://askhowie.com/multivariate to see how to create a multi-
variate experiment.

 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
 
 The next page is a checklist of what you need to complete before the 
test can go live. (See Figure 14-5.) Identify the original page and at least 
one variation you’ve created. At first, stick to one variation — you’ll get 
results much quicker and they’ll be much clearer than if you compare 
several pages.
 
Figure 14-5: 
Google 
reminds you 
of the three 
elements 
necessary 
to begin 
a test.
 
 
4. When you have this information readily available, check the I’ve 
Completed the Steps Above box and click the Create button to 
continue.
 
 At the beginning of the chapter, I give you a process to help you decide 
what to test. Now you tell Google the URL of the B version of your origi-
nal page, as well as the URL of your thank-you page.
 
 In Figure 14-6, you see how Richard completed the setup form for an 
experiment that he was just beginning when we started working on this 
chapter. If you’re curious, visit http://askhowie.com/testresults 
to find out the winner and get some commentary from Richard and me 
on what it means for his site.

Specifying Experiment Details
The following list helps you get the details right. Use it to specify the details 
on your first experiment in Google Website Optimizer:
 
1. Name the experiment.
 
 Enter a meaningful name for your experiment; this is how you will find it 
in the experiment list. (After you start testing and improving your profit-
ability, you will create many more tests.)
 
2. Enter the URL for the original page.

309
 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
 
3. Enter a name and URL for the variation page you are testing.
 
4. Click the Add Another Page Variation link (refer to Figure 14-6) and 
repeat Step 3 if you want to add more variations.
 
5. Enter the URL of the conversion page (your thank-you page).
 
 The conversion page is the page that visitors land on after they com-
plete the action you wish to optimize. For example, after a sale, visitors 
generally land on a thank-you page, which is an ideal conversion page 
for GWO testing.
Google checks the URLs as soon as you type them, to make sure the pages 
exist. If every page receives a happy green check mark, you’re ready to gener-
ate the tracking script that’s installed on each page involved in the test.
Website Optimizer uses JavaScript tags on the pages to track visits and show 
different versions of the page to different visitors. Your job is to copy and 
paste these JavaScript tags into your pages. If you aren’t terrified of HTML, 
you can easily do it yourself, in which case you choose the option, You Will 
Install and Validate the JavaScript Tags. (See Figure 14-7.)
If you don’t want to do this yourself, you can have your Webmaster do it 
for you by choosing the option, Your Web Team Will Install and Validate 
JavaScript Tags. Just remember that the whole process should take about 
five minutes, so make sure you’re billed accordingly.
 
Figure 14-7: 
You can 
install the 
tags your-
self or have

For the sake of your comprehensive AdWords education, I’m going to assume 
you selected the Do It Yourself option. The next page gives you the JavaScript 
tags and allows you to validate proper installation on your pages. (See 
Figure 14-8.)

 Chapter 14: Making More Sales with Website Optimizer
This feature of GWO rocks big time (that’s online marketing slang for “is a 
very useful feature”). It ensures that your tests actually provide you with valid 
results or the tests don’t even start. Take it from someone who once sent $250 
of AdWords traffic to the wrong page, and almost stopped selling the product 
because he thought it wasn’t selling — you can’t be too careful here.
Adding and validating your 
own JavaScript tags
GWO uses an elegant configuration of JavaScript tags to send traffic to multiple 
pages without slowing down your Web pages or relying on external servers. 
Follow these steps to place the JavaScript tags:
 
1. Original page: Add the control script and tracking script.
 
 On the original page, you will install two JavaScript tags, the control 
script and the tracking script. The control script goes at the top of the 
page, just after the <head> tag. (See Figure 14-9.)
 
 The tracking script goes at the bottom of the page, just before the 
</body> tag. (See Figure 14-10.)
 
 To copy the JavaScript tag, click anywhere in the shaded blue area to 
select the entire code snippet. Then copy it as you normally would.
 
 Open your original page in your HTML editor, select the option to 
view the HTML source, and then paste the JavaScript tag at the top 
of the page.
 
Figure 14-9: 
The control 
script goes 
near the 
top of the 
page, just 
below the 
<head> tag.

script for

nal page

2. Variation page: Add the tracking script.
 
 Place the variation tracking script at the bottom of each variation page. 
Figure 14-11 shows the variation tracking script in its proper location, 
just above the </body> tag.

 At the top of Figure 14-12, the website optimizer code for wide 
landing page test comment helps you identify which test is con-
nected to the script, so you can remove it after the test is over. Placing 
/* before the comment and */ after the comment lets the browser know 
to ignore it, so it doesn’t affect anything on the visible page.
 
 After you’re hooked on Website Optimizer, you can end up with quite 
a few of these conversion scripts on your conversion page. Manually 
adding a comment helps you figure out which ones can be deleted 
because you’ll recognize the completed experiments.
 
4. Upload the changed files to your Web server.
 
 When all the JavaScript tags are in place, upload the files to your Web 
server using an FTP program. When the updated pages are in place, 
you’re ready to validate the JavaScript tags.
 
 Click the Validate Pages button at the bottom of the page (refer to Figure 
14-8) to make sure everything is in the right place. Website Optimizer 
checks the pages and the JavaScript tags to be sure your experiment is 
ready to run. When validation completes, you see the Congratulations 
message, as shown in Figure 14-13.
 
 Click the OK button, and then click Continue to go the experiment 
console.
 
5. Preview the experiment pages.
 
 Before starting your experiment, take a minute to preview your pages. In 
the experiment console, click the Preview link to verify your pages are 
showing what you want to show. (See Figure 14-14.)

6. Start the experiment.
 
 If the pages all look good, close the preview window and click the Start 
Experiment button. (Refer to Figure 14-14.)
 
 An experiment status page appears, as shown in Figure 14-18.
 
 Your experiment is now running and may begin to show you prelimi-
nary results within a few hours, depending on traffic. One of the most 
awesomely cool things (marketing jargon for “nice features”) of GWO is 
that it tells you when the test is complete. Unlike ad split testing (see 
Chapter 12), GWO bakes your test and sounds a timer when the results 
are statistically significant.
 
7. Decide how much traffic to send to the variation pages.
 
 At the bottom of the experiment status page, you can select a percent-
age of the traffic to send to the entire test. The default, 100%, means that 
if you are testing one variation, 50 percent of the visitors will see the 
original and 50 percent will see the variation.
 
 If your original page is already working well, I recommend dialing down 
the amount of traffic you’re sending to an untested page. Choosing 
50% from the drop-down menu will exempt half of your traffic from the 
test, so those visitors will go directly to the original page. The other 
half will be split evenly between the original page and the variation 
page. Therefore, only 25 percent of your traffic will be subjected to the 
untested version of the page. If you are testing two variation pages, the 
original page will receive 66.67 percent of the traffic (50 percent plus 
one-third of the remaining 50 percent), while each variation will get 16.67 
percent. The more traffic you send to the test, the faster you get a statis-
tically valid result, but the greater the risk of losing leads and sales to a 
poorly performing challenger.
 
 Don’t worry too much about a visitor returning and seeing a different 
page. GWO places a cookie on all visitors’ browsers, so if they return, 
GWO “remembers” them and shows them the same page they saw the 
first time. That’s why the preview tool is necessary — you wouldn’t be 
able to see the other pages in your test otherwise. The only ways visi-
tors could see another version of the page are if they use a different 
browser, use a completely different computer, or clear the cookies from 
their browser.
 
8. Interpret and act on the results.
 
 When your test is live, GWO counts the number of visitors who see each 
variation, and how many of them convert. These numbers tell you at a 
glance how your original and variations are doing. Figure 14-19 shows a 
test in progress in which both variations are performing worse than the 
original. The second variation has already lost (it’s color-coded red for 
“loser”), while the first variation is losing, but hasn’t amassed enough 
data for a conclusive call.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
 Here’s what each of the columns means:
 
• Est. Conv. Rate: The estimated conversion rate is the rate at which 
visitors to that page end up on the conversion page. The original 
in Figure 14-19 is converting at 47.4%, with a margin of error of plus 
or minus 13%. The margin of error is large because the test hasn’t 
run long enough to be statistically significant.
 
• Chance to Beat Original: What are the chances that this particular 
variation will outperform the original in a head-to-head test? 50% is 
a dead heat, so anything less than 50% means the original is prob-
ably going to be the winner.
 
• Observed Improvement: How much better is this variation than the 
original? In both cases in Figure 14-19, this number is negative, 
indicating that the original is in the lead.
 
• Conv./Visitors: The raw data for each page. The original has con-
verted 18 out of 38 visitors (which is where Google got the esti-
mated conversion rate of 47.7%). The first variation converted a 
respectable 13/36, which is 23.8 percent worse than the original 
(hence the observed improvement of –23.8%). The second varia-
tion only converted 7 out of 32 visitors, which makes it a clear 
loser — even at this early stage. Google will continue to send traf-
fic to losers, but you can manually “prune” them from your test by 
clicking the box to the left of the variation name and then clicking 
the Disable button at the top of the table.
 
9. Run a follow-up test to validate the results.
 
 Figure 14-20 shows a test in which one variation (Combination 1) has 
outperformed both the original and the other variation, but not quite 
to the point of statistical significance. Despite Google singing along 
with Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, “Won’t you stay, just a little bit 
longer?”, the account owner has decided that a 92.7% chance to beat 
the original (with a conversion rate of more than 40% compared with 
the original’s 34%) is good enough. Even if you heed Google’s advice and 
keep the test running until you reach the magic 95% confidence interval 
(and see the bar turn from yellow to green), you still want to be on the 
safe side and run a follow-up test.
 
 Click the Follow Up link at the top of the test to launch the follow up. 
Google handles the thinking for you here by selecting the best variation 
and pitting it, head to head, against the original. As an added service, 
Google sends most of the traffic to the better performing page. The 
worse page gets just enough traffic to confirm that it should retire and 
produce a line of kitchen product infomercials (or whatever defeated 
landing pages do for a second career these days), and not enough traffic 
to significantly hurt sales. When the follow-up test proves conclusive, 
you can crown (or re-crown) your champion and get ready to run your 
next test. (See Figure 14-21.)

10. Declare a winner and start a new test.
 
 At this writing, no automatic notification system exists to alert you by 
e-mail, SMS, or gentle electric shock that you have a winner. So you must 
keep checking GWO until Google declares a winner.
Now you can return to your list of ideas for testing, and choose the next-
most significant one. Create the landing page variation that embodies your 
question, and then begin a new test. Thoughtful and consistent testing is the 
single-most powerful strategy for turning a lackluster AdWords campaign into 
a big winner. So go forth and test!

Slashing Your Costs with 
Conversion Tracking
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up conversion tracking
▶ Understanding the numbers
▶ Creating and automating reports
▶ Keeping track of your ads’ and keywords’ ROI
▶ Adjusting your ad campaigns to improve ROI
S
ay you’re split-testing two ads, and one gets a click through rate (CTR) 
of 1.00%, while the other attracts only 0.77%. The first ad is definitely a 
keeper, right? Without conversion tracking, you might think so. But what if 
the first ad attracts lots of nonbuyers, while the second ad gets clicks from 
buyers? Remember that a click on your ad means one thing: You just paid 
Google. When you think about it this way, your AdWords strategy shifts from 
trying to get the highest CTR to enticing only the most qualified prospects to 
your site. In order to tell which ad leads to sales and not just clicks, you need 
to install conversion tracking.
By conversion, Google simply means an action that you want a visitor to 
take on your Web site. When you can track a visitor’s actions on your site, 
you know what clicks lead to sales. Conversion tracking also allows you to 
bid more intelligently on keywords. You may find that a high-traffic keyword 
that’s costing you a lot of money isn’t actually generating leads and sales. You 
can then lower your bid, change your offer, or fire the keyword. Without con-
version tracking, all your campaign-management efforts are shots in the dark, 
tinkering with inputs without really knowing what’s happening at the other 
end. It’s like learning to shoot free throws in basketball with no feedback 
about whether your shot went in or missed left, right, too far, or too short.
Conversion tracking is simply a snippet of code added to your Web site that 
places a cookie on your visitors’ computers. This cookie tells Google where 
the visitors came from, down to the keyword and the ad, and what they did 
on your site. You can see which ads and keywords are making you money, 

322
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
and which aren’t. In this chapter, I show you how to set up conversion track-
ing correctly (do it wrong and you’ll suffer from the GIGO — Garbage In, 
Garbage Out — Syndrome and make lots of bad decisions). You see how 
to read and interpret the data generated by conversion tracking, and how 
to improve your account based on this new intelligence. You also discover 
how to design quick-scan reports that can be generated automatically and 
e-mailed to you on a regular basis.
Setting Up Conversion Tracking
From the Tools tab, choose Conversion Tracking from the drop-down list. 
Google allows you to track the performance of online ads and traditional 
media ads. I focus on online ads in this book. Click the Create an Action 
button to continue. 
On the next page, name your conversion. In Figure 15-1, I’m tracking Ring of 
Fire subscriptions, specifically 1-month trials of the Lava Lounge member-
ship level (turns out volcanoes and earthquakes provide an endless source of 
metaphorical amusement for me).

 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
Choosing a conversion type
Google identifies five different types of conversions that you may want to track: 
sales, leads, signups, views of a page, and other, as shown in Figure 15-2. You 
can track as many different conversions as you want. The following list gives 
you a look at the five types of conversions so you can determine when it makes 
sense to use each one:
 
✓ Purchase/Sale: If you sell products online, you can determine exactly 
how much money you make from each ad and keyword.
 
✓ Lead: If you collect contact information so you can follow up with Web 
site visitors, you can track leads. If you don’t sell products online, and 
use the Web mostly for lead generation, you can get very powerful infor-
mation on cost-per-lead for your ads and keywords.
 
✓ Signup: Google distinguishes between signups and leads; I don’t. If 
someone subscribes to my online newsletter, then by golly, I think of him 
as a lead. If you maintain two lists, you can distinguish them by treating 
one as a list of leads and the other as a list of signups.
 
✓ Views of a Key Page: Say you have a certain page that you want visitors 
to see because you’ve noticed a connection between traffic to that page 
and the success of your business. Maybe it’s the About Us page, maybe 
a powerful testimonial, or maybe your daily menu. You can determine 
which ads and keywords reliably generate visitors who get to that page.
 
✓ Other: I can’t think of any others. If you can, this is the one to use.
Choose one of these types for your first conversion to track.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Revenue for your action (0ptional)
Enter a number in this box if you wish to assign a monetary value to the 
conversion. The easiest example is a sale: If you sell a product for $37, that 
conversion is worth $37 to your top line. You can enter the sale price or your 
net profit as the conversion value, whatever makes more sense. I prefer to 
use net profit, so I can see that a keyword with a CPC of $0.35 is worth $0.75 
in my bank account, after expenses.
You can create conversions of many different values. If you sell three versions 
of the same product, you can put different-valued conversion code on the 
thank-you page for each version, as shown in Table 15-1.
Table 15-1 
Sample Conversion Values by Product

If you can track the value of each conversion, the knowledge you gain can dra-
matically improve your AdWords results. One client installed conversion track-
ing with specific values on February 7, and by March 31 had slashed monthly 
AdWords spending by almost $14,000 — without sacrificing any profit. We 
simply eliminated all the keywords and ads that weren’t leading to sales.
Describe page where action is completed
Before generating the tracking code, you need to tell Google three more 
things: the language of your Web page (English, Spanish, Russian, and so on), 
the security level of the page on which you will place the code, and the type 
of page.
 
✓ Language: From the drop-down menu, select the language of your text 
block. Google will translate the “Google Site Stats — send feed-
back” text block into that language.
 
✓ Security Level: The tracking code goes on the page following the conver-
sion. You are concerned only with the security level of that confirmation 
page, the one where you put the code. You have two choices, based on 
the URL prefix:
http:// - normal security
https:// - heightened security

325
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
 
 In other words, if the URL of the page your visitor goes to following the 
conversion starts with https://, then choose the https:// option from 
the Select a Security Level drop-down list. Not doing so will cause your 
visitor to see a nasty little security-alert pop-up.
 
✓ Markup Language: If your visitor is browsing your Web page on a regu-
lar desktop or laptop computer, keep the default setting, html. The other 
settings are for Web pages designed for various mobile devices.
Customize tracking indicator
In this section, you can design the block of text that lets your Web site visi-
tors know that Google is monitoring their online activity. The default is one 
line of white text on a gray background. Google automatically adjusts the text 
color — either white or black — to be visible against the background you 
choose. Customize this text block to keep it from standing out on your Web 
page. Generally, I leave the default alone. Click the Save Action & Get Code 
button at the bottom of the page to continue.
Generating and copying the code
You now can generate the code that goes on your Web page (for example, if 
you’re tracking sales, you’d insert the code into your “Thanks for your pur-
chase” page). Click anywhere in the text box to select the entire code snip-
pet, as shown in Figure 15-3.
 
I recommend copying the conversion code and pasting it into a plain text doc-
ument (a .txt file, not a .doc or .rtf) for safekeeping, rather than imme-
diately dropping the code into your Web page. That way, you have a saved 
version of the code if you ever need it again. Make sure you give the text docu-
ment an obvious-but-descriptive name, such as Google Conv Tracking.
txt. Do not save the code in a Microsoft Word format such as .doc or .docx 
because those formats add filler code that can render the code ineffective.
That’s it! You’ve generated the tracking code. You don’t need to click the 
Return to Conversion Tracking button; simply go back to the Campaigns tab 
in the Campaign Management submenu. You should see six new columns — 
Conv. Rate, Cost/Conv., and Conversions, each in two flavors, many-per-click 
and 1-per-click — filled completely with zeroes. (If you can’t see these columns, 
click the Filter and Views button just above the right-most column, select Edit 
Columns from the drop-down list, and check the Conv. box to show all six 
columns. Click the Save button to return to the Campaign view, now with the 
conversion columns.) When you place the code on your Web site, Google 
replaces the zeroes with actual data.

Figure 15-3: 
Clicking 
inside the 
text box

the code 
selects the 
entire 
snippet.
 
Putting code on your Web site
The code snippet goes on the Web page that your visitor reaches after suc-
cessfully taking the action you’re measuring. In other words, if you want them 
to opt in, the code goes on the “Thank you for opting in” page. For conver-
sion tracking to be accurate, three things must be true about this page:
 
1. Every visitor who performs the desired action goes to the confirmation 
page (into which you insert the conversion code) following that action.
 
2. A visitor who doesn’t perform the desired action will not get to the con-
firmation page.
 
3. Vistors can’t refresh the confirmation page to create false multiple con-
versions. (See www.askhowie.com/norefresh for a demo, as well as 
details on how to do that with PHP. Pay special attention to the last sen-
tence before refreshing the page.)
If the conversion is a page view, then the code goes on the viewed page itself. 
In other cases, the confirmation page is the next page. If you are using an 
e-mail–management service, such as AWeber (see Chapter 10), put your code 
on the page you designate as the Thank You page in the autoresponder setup.

Common tracking-code mistakes
The following list gives you a rundown of the common mistakes people make 
when inserting the conversion code (by reading this list and taking it to 
heart, you can avoid these mishaps!):
 
✓ Putting the code in the header or footer: If you place the tracking code 
in the header or footer of a page, it may show up on every single page in 
your Web site. Every page view will then be counted as a conversion.
 
✓ Putting code on the wrong page: Don’t put the tracking code on the 
conversion page itself, but on the page that is served following success-
ful conversion. (An exception is a page view conversion, where the con-
firmation page and the page itself are one and the same.)
 
✓ Putting the code on the same page multiple times: With complicated 
Web pages, it’s easy to forget that you already placed the tracking code 
on the page.

328
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
 If you’re not sure whether your tracking code is on your Web page, view 
the source code of the page. Here’s the drill:
 
1. Choose View➪Source in your browser.
 
 The source code appears in a text editor window.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Find, and enter Google Code in the Find What text box.
 
3. Click the Find Next button to search the code.
Tracking sales from a shopping cart
You can configure conversion tracking to record the total amount your visi-
tors spend by using dynamic fields generated by your e-commerce system. 
For example, if you use Yahoo! Stores or eBay/PayPal shops, you can modify 
the code snippet to tell Google how much a visitor spent on your site. You 
can also get this information from a shopping cart written in ASP (Active 
Server Pages), JSP (Sun Java Server Pages), or PHP.
See Chapter 17 for more on the power of this level of tracking.
 
If you aren’t a proficient coder and don’t know what CGI means, please don’t 
try this yourself. Send your Webmaster to https://adwords.google.com/
select/setup.pdf for full documentation on configuring dynamic shopping 
carts for conversion tracking. 
Testing conversion tracking
To see whether Google is tracking the conversion you set up, you have two 
choices: the quick and (possibly) expensive way or the natural way. The 
quickest way to confirm correct setup is to search Google for your keyword, 
click your ad, and perform the desired action. You should see that conver-
sion in your campaign summary screen as a non-zero number somewhere in 
the six new columns (see the following section). If you don’t want to waste a 
click, your other choice is to wait for a real visitor to convert. I recommend 
spending the money yourself and making sure that you’re getting useful data.
Introducing Six New Columns
Once you trigger conversion tracking by generating the code snippet, Google 
shows you six new columns in the campaign management pages: Conv. Rate 
(conversion rate), Cost/Conv. (cost per conversion), and Conv. (conver-
sions), as shown in Figure 15-5 (I’ve removed the other columns to keep the 
image uncluttered). These columns also appear at the ad group, keyword, 

329
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
placement, and ad levels, so you can see the effectiveness of every unit of 
your AdWords account. Until you place the conversion code on your site and 
visitors start converting, you will see zeroes in those columns. Also, expect a 
24-hour delay in reporting a conversion.
 
Figure 15-5: 
Six new 
columns 
appear after 
you initiate 
conversion 
tracking.
 
Conversions (many-per-click 
and 1-per-click)
These columns tell you how many conversions were generated by the element in 
that row; campaign, ad group, keyword, placement, or ad. Many-per-click counts 
each conversion by the same visitor. 1-per-click counts all conversions by the 
same visitor as one single conversion. In Figure 15-6, you can see six ad groups 
in the Gout campaign, two of which have led to conversions. The Gout Disabled 
Keywords ad group generated 41 many-per-click conversions, but only eighteen 
1-per-click conversions. If Alberto came to my site and downloaded a free chap-
ter, bought my e-book, and then downloaded a bonus report, that would count 
as 3 many-per-click conversions, but only a single 1-per-click conversion.
Conversion rate (many-per-click 
and 1-per-click)
The conversion rate is the percent of visitors from that campaign, ad group, 
ad, or keyword who complete a conversion. Let’s drill down to the ad 
group level to make this clear. In Figure 15-6, the first group, Gout Disabled 
Keywords, received 2,211 clicks and converted 0.81% of them to at least one 
other action. When you add multiple conversions by the same person, the 
conversion rate rises to 1.85%. If all your conversions are product sales, then 
it makes sense to pay close attention to the many-per-click conversion rate. If 
most of the conversions are intermediate steps — a newsletter subscription 
or the completion of a quote request — and the sale happens only once, then 
the 1-per-click numbers are more important.

330
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
Figure 15-6: 
Conversion 
statistics 
help me 
calculate 
the ROI 
of my ad 
groups.
 
Cost/Conv. (many-per-conversion 
and 1-per-conversion)
The third new metric, Cost/Conv., refers to how much you spent on AdWords, 
on average, for each conversion. In the Gout Disabled Keywords group, for 
example, I spent $9.71 for each person who completed at least one conver-
sion. Whether that’s good or bad depends on how much the conversion is 
worth to me. In this case, a conversion is worth at least $17.77, so I’ll take 
that gross profit of $8.06 per conversion. Again, because multiple conversions 
don’t make me any more money than a single sale, I don’t pay much attention 
to the average cost of all the conversions. Instead, I separate the conversions 
and measure the cost and return of each one. I can do this with AdWords 
Reports (discussed later in this chapter), or in the Conversion Tracking 
module (discussed in the next section).
 
Actually, I’m making less than $8.06 per conversion because I have to pay 
for credit card processing. When your margins are tight, make sure you’re 
accounting for all costs when you determine your ROI.

331
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
The second ad group is bringing in customers for $11.29 each, or a profit of 
$6.48 per conversion. Still okay, but not as good as the first group. In general, 
the lower this number, the better you’re doing. The exception is when the 
cost-per-conversion is zero.
Look at the next four groups to see this clearly: no sales, so a $0.00 cost per 
conversion. Zero is the worst number to see in this column, because it means 
you’ve achieved nothing. Luckily, my AdWords expenditures for these groups 
are low (see the numbers in the Cost column). Also, they haven’t generated 
enough clicks during this period to yield statistically significant results (see 
Chapter 13 for a discussion of split testing and statistical significance).

In Figure 15-8, you can see all the sales of the basic version of my gout e-book 
from the Gout campaign. The Gout Diet ad group, for example, generated 64 
sales from 27,085 clicks, for a conversion rate of 0.24 percent. That’s useful 
information, but still doesn’t let me compare the most important numbers: 
cost and return. To achieve the holy grail of results-accountable marketing, you 
need to track return on investment (ROI) of every element of your account.

Tracking ROI of Ads and Keywords
The information at the level of campaigns and ad groups is nice, but not 
particularly useful. Where conversion tracking becomes a powerful driver of 
action is at the levels of specific ads and keywords.
Identifying the profitable ads
After you have conversion tracking in place, you can compare two ads com-
peting in the same ad group, not just to see which one attracts more clicks, 
but which one attracts more qualified clicks. The method I outline works 
both with text ads purchased on a CPC basis and image ads bought on a cost-
per-thousand-impressions basis because you reduce all the data to a single 
number: profit per thousand impressions.

333
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
I began this chapter with a hypothetical example of two ads with CTRs of 
1.00% and 0.77%. Without conversion tracking, you would declare the 1.00% 
ad the winner and start testing a new ad. As you can see in Figure 15-9, you 
could be making a big mistake.
 
Figure 15-9: 
The lower-
CTR ad is 
almost four 
times more 
profitable 
than the 
higher-
CTR ad.
 
The conversion in this case was an opt-in, to receive two free chapters of the 
Leads into Gold home-study course. The first ad, the one with the “better” CTR, 
converted fewer than 1 in 10 visitors to leads. The second ad, while attracting 
fewer clicks, converted 1 out of 3 visitors to leads. You can see the difference in 
dollars and cents when you compare the two ads’ cost per conversion metrics. 
Each lead cost me $9.19 when the first ad was shown, compared to only $2.38 
when the lead saw the second ad.
Why is the second ad so much more effective at delivering qualified prospects? 
Look at the call to action in the second description line: “Free report and 2 chap-
ter download.” Visitors are enticed by the promise of a two-chapter download; 
the real question isn’t why so many of them converted, but why so many more 
didn’t opt in to download the two chapters.
Higher CTR often means lower site conversions
Lest you think the previous example was a fluke, I’m going to draw back the 
curtain a little more on my AdWords campaign. Figure 15-10 shows a second 
set of ads, almost identical in language, in which the same inverse relation-
ship exists between CTR and site conversion.
 
Figure 15-10: 
One word 
makes a 
world of

Why should the word effective improve my site conversion from 10.5% to 14% 
compared to the word powerful? I can’t know for sure, but my guess is that 
powerful is a more attractive word and therefore casts a wider net than effec-
tive, while effective attracts more serious business owners who are predis-
posed to take the time to study my Web site and accept my offer.
 
Please take the moral of this story to heart: CTR is usually far less important 
than the cost per conversion. But until you set up conversion tracking, you’re 
like the guy in the joke (for some reason, it’s always a guy in the joke) who’s 
looking for his keys under the street lamp, even though he lost them in the 
dark on the other side of the street. When asked why he’s looking in the wrong 
place, he answers, “Because the light’s better here.” As business strategist 
Peter Senge reminds us, “We can’t expect what we don’t inspect.” If you want 
higher CTRs, you can get them without paying attention to conversion. But if 
you want higher profits, you must inspect your site conversion data.
Balancing CTR and cost per conversion
CTR still matters. It’s related to profitability because of Google’s bid price 
formula: The higher the CTR, the lower the CPC. Also, you might run an ad 
with a miserable CTR that nevertheless converts at a high level. But because 
it sends so little traffic to your site, the high conversion rate contributes little 
to your bottom line.
You can balance an ad’s CTR and cost per conversion by calculating a metric 
based on initial input and ultimate output: How much are 1,000 impressions 
worth to you? Table 15-2 presents an example in which three ads receive 
5,000 impressions each.

Which ad do you keep? If you look solely at CTR, it’s easy: Ad #1 is the clear 
winner. But now that you’ve added conversion tracking, you can compare the 
ads’ respective cost per conversion. By that measure, Ad #3 is the winner, 
generating a conversion for $1.67, compared to Ad #2’s cost per conversion 
of $3.70 and Ad #1’s bloated $4.17.
The trouble with Ad #3 is the tiny amount of traffic it generates. What you 
really want to know is which ad makes the most money? To calculate profit 

335
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
per ad, you need two more numbers: total number of conversions and value 
of a conversion.
 
Calculating the total number of conversions is easy: just multiply number of 
clicks by the conversion rate and divide by 100. Ad #1’s total conversion is 
300 × 12 ÷ 100 = 36.
The value of a conversion answers how much one of that action is worth to 
your business. If you’re tracking hard sales data, Google can give you this 
information in the Reports section (see the “Creating Easy-to-Understand 
Reports” section, later in this chapter). If you’re tracking throughput data, 
such as leads or page views, you may need to estimate the value of a conver-
sion to your business. In this example, let’s assume that a conversion is a $45 
sale, of which you get to keep $40 after cost of goods and processing fees. 
Now you can redo Table 15-2 as shown in Table 15-3.

When you deposit your check in the bank, it doesn’t give you extra money for 
having a high CTR or a low cost per conversion. When split-testing ads within 
a single ad group, the most important number is the amount of money you 
make per thousand impressions, after paying for your clicks.
 
The preceding example reflects a situation where your first sale is your only 
sale. If you make the lion’s share of your profits from back end sales (sales 
after the first one), and if those sales occur online, you can still use the aver-
age cost per impression metric to choose a winner. If you can’t track the lucra-
tive back end sales through Google, you may just want to treat your AdWords 
campaigns as pure lead generation: whichever ad produces the most leads (in 
the case just cited, Ad #1) is the winner.
Keywords
You can also track ROI for each keyword in your Google search, and search 
partners’ campaigns. Armed with this information, you can tighten your ad 
groups, lower or raise your bids on individual keywords to improve ROI or 
increase traffic for profitable keywords, and pause or delete keywords that 
cost more than they make.

336
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Figure 15-11 shows an ad group for Leads into Gold. The overall cost per con-
version for this ad group is $23.86, far too high to be profitable. Say that my 
break-even is $18.00 per conversion. All the keywords with a cost per conver-
sion greater than $18.00, or at $0.00, are current money losers. They include 
cold calls at a whopping $76.66 per conversion, all the way down to cold 
calling techniques at an almost-acceptable $19.94. The keywords with 
cost per conversion between $17.15 and $4.73 are all fine, but the one below 
those are generating no conversions at all, just costing me Google clicks.
The keyword conversion data can be fed back into campaign management 
(see Chapters 7 and 8) to continually lower your costs and increase your 
profits.

 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
Creating Easy-to-Understand Reports
Google allows you to create reports that distinguish between leads, signups, 
page views, and sales. You can see which ads and keywords are making you 
money, and exactly how much. You can identify the keywords that are doing 
their job — that is, generating more money than they cost. And, you can auto-
mate the reporting to receive exactly the numbers you need in your inbox on 
a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
To create a report, follow these steps:
 
1. From within your AdWords account, click the Reporting tab and select 
Reports from the drop-down list.
 
2. Click the Create a New Report link in the center of the page to create 
your first report, as shown in Figure 15-12.
 
 If you’ve already run reports, you’ll see a list of the last five reports 
that have run, as well as any saved report templates at the bottom of 
the page.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Types of reports
Google enables you to choose from several different types of reports, including:
 
✓ Placement/Keyword Performance: This report tells you how each key-
word is doing. Earlier in this chapter, the two conversion columns in the 
campaign management console mushed all the conversions together 
into one undifferentiated pile. In a report, you can separate out multiple 
conversions and assign a monetary value to each one.
 
✓ Ad Performance: This type of report lets you know which ad in a split 
test is the most profitable based on ROI and total profit. Depending on 
your Web site’s sales process, you may place more value on generat-
ing leads or on sales numbers; you can configure reports that give you 
exactly the numbers you need in order to make profitable decisions.
 
✓ URL Performance: This report evaluates your destination URLs. You can 
split-test landing pages this way, but it’s messy. You’re better off using 
a third-party tool (see Chapter 13 for the details of split-testing) to test 
landing pages; you can swap pages in and out in one place, rather than 
in the destination URLs of perhaps dozens of different ads.
 
✓ Ad Group, Campaign, and Account Performance: These three report 
types (Ad Group, Campaign, and Account Performance) are useful for 
two reasons: their ability to show you hourly results and a metric called 
Impression Share (IS). You can find out what time of day you receive the 
most impressions, the highest CTR, the most clicks, and the highest and 
lowest CPC. This information can help you schedule ads so they don’t 
show at certain unfavorable times of day. 
 
 Impression Share compares the number of impressions your ads receive 
to the total number they could have received if you were bidding as high 
as possible with as large a budget as possible. An impression share of 
24 percent, for example, means that your ads did not show 76 percent of 
the time that they could have if you just loosened the purse strings.
 
✓ Demographic Performance: If you are advertising on the content net-
work, you can see how your campaigns perform differently with men 
and women, and with different age groups.
 
✓ Geographic Performance: This report parses your traffic by geographical 
region. You can see, for example, that visitors to your Web site who live in 
Costa Rica are more valuable, on average, than visitors from Quebec.
 
✓ Search Query: This report shows you exactly what people searched 
for prior to clicking your ads. If you bid on a broad match keyword 
like unicycle parts, you might see keywords like 24” unicycle 
parts, giraffe unicycle parts, and unicycle movie parts. 

339
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
You can then add the “good” keywords to your account, and add nega-
tive keywords (like movie) to prevent those searches from triggering 
your ads in the future. A modified version of this report (without the ROI 
metrics, sadly) is available as an inline report within the Keyword tab at 
the campaign or ad group level of your account (www.askhowie.com/
interface-webinar has a video demo of this and other cool hard-to-
show-in-book-form features of the new AdWords interface that started 
popping up in Spring 2009).
 
✓ Placement Performance: If your ads are showing on the content network, 
this report tells you which Web site and pages are displaying them and 
how they’re doing on each. See http://askhowie.com/placementvid 
for a short video tutorial on how to get the most from this report.
Settings
Your settings choices change depending on the report type. Basically, you 
have to make three choices:
 
✓ View (unit of time): How do you want the data chunked by time? You 
can view a summary of all the data; or look at individual years, quarters, 
months, weeks, or days. Some of the reports allow you to look at the 
data on an hourly basis. Hourly (by date) shows each individual hour. 
Hourly (regardless of date) combines the data to show the average 
hourly activity — that is, over the entire date range you’re looking at, 
how does your traffic at 3:00 a.m. differ from traffic at 10:00 a.m. or 
3:00 p.m.?
 
✓ Date range: Over what time frame do you want to examine the data? 
You can choose a default period from the drop-down menu, or specify 
an exact range. Depending on your traffic, you want to choose a period 
that can give you statistically significant results. In other words, if you 
receive only 100 impressions a day, it doesn’t make sense to view one 
day at a time. Instead, choose a period that allows trends to emerge — 
say, a week or a month.
 
✓ Campaigns and ad groups: You can choose to show every ad group in 
every campaign, or look at select ad groups. I like to choose a single ad 
group per report, so I can focus on just the relevant data that can help 
me make decisions. As you’ll see, the amount of data you can generate 
with reports is staggering. The art of running reports is not to generate 
as much data as possible, but as little as allows you to take intelligent 
action. When you choose to manually select campaigns and ad groups 
from a list, a drop-down list of campaigns will appear. You can add the 
campaign directly, or click a campaign name to view its ad groups, which 
you then can add individually.

340
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Advanced settings
Configure the advanced settings to create truly useful reports:
 
✓ Add or Remove Columns: You can select the data to appear in your 
report. Depending on report type, you may have half a dozen options, or 
as many as 50. See the upcoming section, “Customizing Your Reports to 
Show the Most Important Numbers,” for suggestions on which columns 
to display and which to ignore.
 
✓ Filter Your Results: You can limit the scope of the report by showing key-
words, or ads, or ad groups, or campaigns that match any of a number of 
search criteria, as shown in Figure 15-13. Here are just two examples:
 
• You can choose to display only active ads in active ad groups in 
active campaigns.
 
• You can look at content-targeted campaigns only or keywords 
whose average CPC is (say) greater than $3.25.
 
 If you find yourself overwhelmed by gigantic report spreadsheets, spend 
some time looking at filters to see whether any of them will reduce com-
plexity while retaining the key information.
 
Figure 15-13: 
Use filters 
to create 
smaller 
reports that 
are easier to 
understand.
 
Templates, scheduling, and e-mail
You don’t have to go through the whole report-creation process every time. 
You can save reports as templates and schedule them to run automatically 
on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. I like to schedule reports to run weekly 
that show me activity for the previous 30 days. I can print them, study them, 
and archive them in a binder to understand trends and compare results from 
one month to the next.
I create new reports to answer questions, test hypotheses, and explore my 
campaigns from different angles. When I find a new report to be valuable, I 
schedule it to run on a weekly or monthly basis. My accounts don’t justify 

341
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking
daily reports, but if you get a lot of traffic on a daily basis, you may want to 
devote 10 minutes a day to glancing at the day’s reports. In general, you want 
to spend more time monitoring new campaigns than mature ones.
 
Create a report as a template to save yourself the time and effort of making the 
same choices over and over again for different reports. You can create a tem-
plate with specific columns and filters, and just change the ad group, instead 
of creating each new ad group report from scratch.
You can view reports in HTML format from the Report Center, and/or down-
load them in several formats. I like the HTML view for sorting by different 
columns, just like the campaign-management interface; I like the .csv Excel 
format for printing and performing additional calculations.
Customizing Your Reports to Show 
the Most Important Numbers
Some numbers matter more to your business than others. Let’s explore 
customizing the columns for the keyword performance and ad performance 
reports.
Customizing keyword performance reports
Your column choices for keyword reports are shown in Figure 15-14. 
Basically, your goal is to remove as many columns as you possibly can and 
still get the information you need. So before you choose columns, get clear 
on what are the important questions you want a report to answer:
 
✓ If you have an e-commerce Web site, your most important keyword ques-
tion will likely be, “Which keywords are making money and which are 
losing money?”
 
✓ If the primary purpose of your site is lead generation, you want to know 
how much each lead costs you.
 
✓ If you are generating traffic for clients, you are probably most interested 
in page views.
Sometimes you want to see a bunch of statistics next to each other. I often am 
interested in leads versus sales for particular keywords, so I’ll select leads 
count, sales count, and sales value. I may discover that a certain keyword 
attracts a disproportionate number of buyers, even though it doesn’t compel 
more opt-in conversions.

342
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
Figure 15-14: 
You can 
choose from 
dozens of 
columns 
to create 
keyword 
performance 
reports.
 
For example, in Figure 15-11 earlier in this chapter, most of the keywords in 
the ad group aren’t generating positive ROI, based on the average value of 
a conversion. The keyword cold calls is the top offender at over $75 per 
conversion. The problem with this data is that I can’t distinguish between 
an opt-in and a sale. When I run a keyword-performance report — choosing 
the conversion metrics of cost per conversion, value per click, sales count, 
and sales value (shown in Figure 15-15), I discover a much more nuanced and 
useful picture.
The keyword cold calls turns out to be my best, not worst, keyword. I pay 
an average of $0.86 per click and make an average of $2.18 from each click. 
None of the other keywords led to sales at all.
 
The bottom-line number for keywords is value per click, also known as visitor 
value. This number answers the question, “How much money is a visitor to my 
Web site worth to me, on average?” You should know this number for each of 
your sales channels. When you know your visitor value, you know exactly how 
much you can spend on advertising. The higher your visitor value, the more 
you can afford to pay for traffic. And when you discover that a promotion pro-
duces less or more revenue than you would expect given your averages, you 
can decide whether it’s worth repeating.

343
 Chapter 15: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

word cold 
calls

Perry Marshall often talks about the Unlimited Traffic Technique: Start 
with AdWords, but don’t end there. Use AdWords to improve your sales 
process — meaning, to increase your visitor value. When your visitor value is 
high enough, you can buy all the traffic you want. You can hire search engine 
optimization consultants to boost your organic rankings. You can advertise 
your site on other Web sites, on the radio, in magazines, wherever — because 
you know exactly how much a visitor is worth to you.
Customizing ad performance reports
Your ad performance reports should answer the primary question, “Within 
each ad group, which is the best ad?” In an e-commerce situation, this means 
the ad that puts the most money into your bank account per impression. 
As of this writing, Google does not include a Value/Impression column in its 
reports, so you need to figure this out manually or add a column in a spread-
sheet. Figure 15-16 shows my recommended selections for an e-commerce ad 
performance report. I eliminate as many details as possible so I can see all 
the numbers on one page.

344

Figure 15-16: 
Customize 
reports by 
choosing 
what you 
want to 
see and 
deselecting 
what isn’t 
necessary.
 
In Figure 15-17, you can see the results of the choices I made in Figure 15-16. 
Some columns are mandatory in the report, such as Ad ID and Destination 
URL, but I can easily remove them in Excel because they don’t help me. I can 
also move columns around in Excel, putting related numbers next to each 
other. Most important, I can create additional columns that give me the num-
bers I really need.
In this case, I created a new column (in bold) called Value/Impression*100, 
which is how much every impression is worth to me, multiplied by 100 so 
I can make better sense of the data. The absolute number is less important 
than the comparison of the ads that I’m testing. In rows 13 and 14, the two 
ads in question are identical, except for the end of the Display URL: the one 
with VitalHealthInstitute.com/BeatGout is almost twice as profitable 
as the one with the URL VitalHealthInstitute.com: $0.63 versus $0.32.
Rows 15 and 16 feature two ads, identical except for quotes around “Gout 
Cure” in one. The ad without quotes is almost three times more profitable 
than its competitor, $0.35 versus $0.12. Rows 17 and 18 show again that 
adding a subdomain to the main Display URL has increased profits, $0.24 
versus $0.14.

Figure 15-17: 
The shaded

ads are

You can create a Value/Impression*1000 Column in Excel by dividing the 
sales value by the number of impressions, and multiplying by 1000. Go to 
www.askhowie.com/valueimp for a video tutorial on creating the Value/
Impression*1000 column in Excel.
Or, if you’re as lazy as I am, you can get a tool to do all this for you. After 
years of doing manually what I describe previously, when I started training 
my business partner, Elizabeth, to do it, she rebelled and created a soft-
ware solution that does it all in about 6.3 seconds. For more info, check out 
http://magicadwordsbutton.com.
Discovering What to Do with the Data
Before taking action based on the data, make sure the data is accurate. 
Google is usually not the culprit when data is faulty; instead, you most likely 
made an error in placing the code on your Web pages. If you’re measuring 
opt-ins and sales, it won’t take long to verify the data. Count the number of 
leads Google says you’ve acquired over a given period, and compare it to the 
number of opt-ins to your autoresponder or newsletter list for the same date 
range. If the two numbers are fairly close, you can be confident that you’re 
reading useful data. (Expect the numbers to be slightly off to account for time 
delays between initial click and conversion.) Similarly, compare the sales 
count and sales value for an e-commerce site with the actual sales data from 
your shopping cart or merchant account. Again, they should be close, not 
necessarily identical.

346
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Use the report data to split-test your ads — not on CTR, but on profitability 
(refer to Figure 15-17). As a rule of thumb, wait until each ad has generated at 
least 30 clicks before declaring a winner to make sure your results are statisti-
cally significant and not just a fluke occurrence.
You’re looking for keywords that aren’t paying for themselves, or aren’t as 
profitable as they could be. When you find these keywords, you can adjust 
your bid price (and average position) to reflect their value, you can move 
them into a different ad group and match them to a different landing page 
(see Chapter 8), or you can pause or delete them to stop the bleeding.
If you find a keyword that costs $0.35 per click and has a value per click of $0.27, 
you’re losing 8 cents every time someone clicks your ad. Before deleting the 
keyword, lower your Maximum CPC to $0.26. You may find your visitor value 
increasing because lower positions tend to generate higher-quality clicks. Worst 
case, you’re slightly better than break-even for the keyword. If you’re advertis-
ing on the Content network, then think of placements like keywords — specific 
media channels that are either paying for themselves, or not.
 
If your break-even bid doesn’t generate enough traffic because it puts you on 
page 9 of search results, or is below Google’s minimum bid, then you can try 
moving the keyword to a different ad group and matching it more closely to 
the ad and the landing page. Sometimes getting the keyword quality score to 
Great is all you need to do.
The goal of keyword bid management is to maximize profits per keyword. 
Test your high traffic keywords in different positions. Pay for position 1 for 
a week, and then drop it to position 7 for another week. Tally your sales and 
costs: Which position is more profitable? Over time, you’ll find the sweet spot 
for each keyword. Obviously, if your campaigns contain thousands of key-
words, you’ll want to focus on the top traffic keywords.

n Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping (Texere Publishing), Paco 
Underhill shares the insights gleaned from 20 years of his study of the 
science of shopping. Some of these include
 
✓ Putting shopping baskets all over bookstores.
 
✓ Making the women’s clothing aisles wide to avoid the irritation of 
“butt-brush.”
 
✓ Putting fitting rooms next to the men’s clothing section because men 
buy mostly based on fit, while women consider many other factors.
These findings may seem like common sense to you, but I wouldn’t have 
come up with them in a hundred years. And neither did the giants of retail 
until they hired Underhill to study shopper behavior and redesign their 
stores. Underhill’s company Web site, www.envirosell.com, describes the 
methodology for a typical engagement:
 
✓ Twelve Staples stores were studied in different markets across the 
country for two days each.
 
• Shoppers were observed throughout their visit by in-store observers.
 
• Video, focused in different areas of the store, recorded shopping 
patterns for eight hours each research day.

348
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
• Shoppers were intercepted and interviewed after they completed their 
shopping visit.
 
• A manager and an associate from each store were interviewed by 
researchers to gather their insights on the store.
I bring this up to explain how incredibly lucky you are as a Web site proprietor 
to not to have to go through this to improve the effectiveness of your site. 
You can observe your customers without hiring armies of consultants, 
without intercepting them for interviews, and without watching hours of 
video. All you have to do, in fact, is install Google Analytics tracking code on 
your site and you’ll be able to evaluate and redesign your online store with 
greater accuracy, less risk, and greater speed than you could ever manage 
offline.
You can view — in minute detail — the parts of your site that frustrate or 
detour your visitors. You can compare this month to last month. You can 
define goals and funnels and watch your visitors convert or bail at every 
point on the navigation path. You can identify pages that don’t work, and 
replace them in minutes. And you can automatically connect all this data to 
your AdWords cost-and-conversion data to segment your traffic by keyword 
(and other characteristics).
In this chapter, I draw heavily on the expertise generously provided by 
Timothy Seward of ROI Revolution, online at www.roirevolution.com. 
(Especially since Google completely overhauled Analytics three weeks before 
my book deadline — thanks, Sergey and Larry!) Including even one-tenth of 
what Timothy has taught me would have turned this book into a medicine 
ball, so I’m limiting the information on Analytics in two ways:
 
✓ I just show you how to track AdWords traffic. You can configure 
Analytics to tell you cool stuff about all your visitors; in fact, it will tell 
you all about organic search engine traffic by default. I’m going to ignore 
all that and let you explore it on your own. (Once you understand how 
Analytics deals with AdWords traffic, the rest isn’t hard.)
 
✓ I don’t get into complicated installations, including integration with 
e-commerce shopping carts or the tracking of downloads or outbound 
links. If you are (or know) someone who’s a code jockey or has years 
of IT experience, feel free to play with these settings. Otherwise, start 
simply — and hire an Analytics expert when you’re ready for advanced 
tracking.
Instead, I show you how to install and configure Analytics to get clean and 
actionable data. I introduce you to some very powerful data screens, and 
show you how to set up experiments and answer interesting questions with 
these data. After you have the data, you discover what to do with it to get 
more leads and sales.

Installing Analytics on Your Web Site
The Google Analytics installation process consists of three steps:
 
1. Creating and configuring an Analytics account
 
2. Adding tracking code to your Web pages
 
3. Creating filters to keep your data clean and useful
Creating an Analytics account
Within your AdWords account, click the Analytics tab. Click the Continue 
button to enter Web site information for your first profile (each Web site 
requires its own profile), as shown in Figure 16-1. You can create multiple 
profiles, but for right now let’s keep it simple.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Make sure 
the two 
check boxes 
are checked 
so your 
AdWords 
data is 
included.
 
 
Enter the Web site URL, and give this account a name. Very important: Make 
sure the check boxes are checked next to Destination URL Auto-tagging and 
Apply Cost Data. Auto-tagging adds information about which keywords your 
visitors typed and which ads they clicked to arrive at your site.
 
Google warns that a small percentage of Web sites can’t handle Auto-tagging. If 
you start getting errors when you click your ads, turn off Auto-tagging and tell 
the following to your Webmaster: “Please configure my site to allow arbitrary 
URL parameters.” When your Webmaster has done this, turn Auto-tagging 
back on.

350
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Checking the Apply Cost Data check box connects AdWords bid costs to your 
Analytics data, so you can calculate the costs and values of various Web site 
conversions.
On the next page, read the epic novel titled Google Analytics Terms of Service — 
and if you agree with each and every provision, check the agreement box at 
the bottom and click the Create New Account button to get started.
Adding tracking code to your Web pages
On the next page, you see a text block containing the Analytics tracking code. 
Click inside that box to select the whole thing, then copy it and paste it into 
every page on your Web site that you are planning to track. The code goes 
just above the </body> tag, near or at the bottom of the source code for 
each page. Your source code may end something like this:
<script type=”text/javascript”>
var gaJsHost = ((“https:” == document.location.protocol) ? 
   “https://ssl.” : “http://www.”);
document.write(unescape(“%3Cscript src=’” + gaJsHost + 
   “google-analytics.com/ga.js’ 
   type=’text/javascript’%3E%3C/script%3E”));
</script>
<script type=”text/javascript”>
try {
var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(“UA-1234567-1”);
pageTracker._trackPageview();
} catch(err) {}</script>
</body>
</html>
 
Don’t copy my code! No ethical objections, just practicality: Each account 
comes with a unique number, which follows the UA- prefix in the code.
If your Web site is built on a template, you can add this code just once and it 
will automatically be added to every page. If you don’t know what I’m talking 
about, just e-mail the code to your Webmaster and tell him or her, “Place this 
code just above the </body> (close-body) tag on every page of my site.”
When you click Continue, you’re taken to the Analytics Overview. Unless 
you’ve added your tracking code already, you’ll see an exclamation icon in 
the status column indicating that the tracking code has not been detected on 
your home page (as shown in Figure 16-2). The exclamation icon will change 
to a green check mark when it’s satisfied that you’ve added the code correctly.
 
Be cautious about installing the Analytics tracking code yourself if any of the 
following conditions exist:

✓ You want to track visitors across more than one domain (for example, 
http://unicyclesforkids.com and http://whoneedstwo
wheels.com).
 
✓ Your site includes subdomains (such as http://stunt.unicycles
forkids.com and http://distance.unicyclesforkids.com).
 
✓ You want to track file downloads (PDFs or MP3s, for example).
 
✓ You have a third-party shopping cart or an e-commerce site.
 
✓ Your visitors can pay you with PayPal or Google Checkout.
 
✓ Your site uses frames (if you’re not sure, ask your Webmaster).
 
✓ Your site generates pages dynamically but the URL remains static (if 
you’re not sure, gently let go of your mouse and move away from the 
computer).

generated junk data long after the error was corrected.
If you want to add more Web sites to your Analytics account, click the Add 
Website Profile link and repeat the process.
Configuring Analytics
While you’re waiting for tracking validation, you can configure your Analytics 
account to allow other users full or restricted access, and to eliminate junk 
data. From the Analytics home page, choose the profile you want to configure 
and click Edit. From this page, you can edit your profile information, create 
conversion goals and funnels, apply filters, and manage additional users.

352
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Adding users
You may want to give other people full or restricted access to your Analytics 
account and data. You can add more users and specify their rights to change 
and view the account. For example, you can give your Webmaster access to 
Webmaster reports only, and you can allow an assistant to view data but not 
change the account configuration.
Add users by clicking the User Manager>> link near the bottom of the 
Analytics control panel (refer to Figure 16-2). Click + Add User at the top 
right, enter their e-mail, and choose an access type: View Reports Only, or 
Account Administrator. See Figure 16-3. If you’ve selected View Reports Only, 
select the profile(s) you want the user to see, and then click Save Changes.
 
Figure 16-3:

users lim-
ited access

Choosing a default page
Every Web site has a default page, defined as the page your Web server 
shows to visitors who enter your Web site name only. For example, someone 
typing www.askhowie.com is automatically redirected to the page http://
askhowie.com/index.php. In this case, index.php is the default page. If 
you aren’t sure of the name of your default page, ask your Webmaster.
If you don’t tell Analytics your default page, then views of your root domain 
(www.askhowie.com) will be counted separately from default page views 
(www.askhowie.com/index.php), even though these two pages are 
actually the same.
From the Profile Settings page, click Edit to configure the Main Website 
Profile Information. Enter your Web site’s default page, not including the root 
domain. You will enter something like this:

Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page when you’re done.
Filtering out internal traffic
A Jewish folk tale from the mythical town of Chelm tells of when Schlemiel 
and his wife opened a lemonade stand on the outskirts of the town market. 
Early in the day, one customer bought a glass for 25 cents. After that, nobody 
bought. Finally, Schlemiel picked up the 25-cent coin and gave it to his wife, 
requested a glass of lemonade. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Schlemiel returned 
the coin to her husband in exchange for a glass. So they went back and 
forth the rest of the day, until the entire supply of lemonade was gone. They 
celebrated their good fortune at having sold out their stock, but couldn’t 
figure out where all the money had gone, and why they had only 25 cents to 
show for their efforts.
You may laugh, but if you don’t create a filter to exclude internal traffic to 
your site, you’re making the same mistake. Internal traffic refers to visits to 
the site by insiders — you, your Webmaster, your colleagues. You don’t want 
these visits to contaminate the important data: the visits by prospects and 
customers.
A filter to exclude internal traffic is pretty simple to set up:
 
1. From the Analytics Settings page, click the FilterManager link and 
click + Add Filter.
 
2. Select Add New Filter for Profile.
 
3. In the Filter Name text box, enter Internal traffic.
 
4. From the Filter Type drop-down menu, choose Exclude All Traffic 
from an IP Address.
 
 Google fills in the next field with something like 63\.212\.171\. 
(shown in Figure 16-4).
 
5. Enter your own IP address and the addresses of anyone else you 
consider internal traffic.
 
 Each computer has its own IP address, so if you work at multiple 
computers, you’ll want to filter them all. You can find your IP address at 
www.whatismyip.com. It consists of four blocks of numbers, separated 
by periods.

354
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
Figure 16-4: 
Ignore 
internal 
traffic by 
filtering 
out the IP 
addresses 
of internal 
users.
 
 
 If your IP address is 12.34.56.78, for example, you enter the following into 
Analytics:
12\.34\.56\.78
 
 The \ character is a backslash, located just above the Return or Enter 
key on most keyboards.
 
 When you’ve created filters for all internal users, you can apply those 
filters to all Analytics profiles (see the next step).
 
6. Select Apply Existing Filter to Profile and you can choose from a list 
of filters to apply to that profile.
Analytics allows you to create many different kinds of filters. You can find a 
list if you choose Custom Filter from the Filter Type drown-down menu. For 
now, don’t worry about adding more filters. When you start receiving data, 
you’ll quickly see pages that are unnecessarily segmented by Analytics, and 
you can create filters to correct the problems.
For more information about how to configure filters and determine that you 
need them, check out www.roirevolution.com/filters on the ROI 
Revolution blog.
Configuring goals and funnels
A goal refers to something you want your Web site visitors to do — such as 
fill out a form, buy something, visit a particular page, download a file, and so 
on. Except for file downloads and clicks on links to other Web sites, you 
configure a goal by identifying the page your visitor goes to after completing 
the conversion.

355
 Chapter 16: Making More Sales with Google Analytics
If the goal is an opt-in to your newsletter, the Goal page is the thank-you page 
visitors arrive at after completing the opt-in form. For a goal page to work, 
two things must be true: The only way someone ends up on that page is by 
doing what you want them to do, and everyone who takes that action ends 
up on that page.
Creating a goal
Click the Edit link next to the first goal, labeled G1. On the next page (shown 
in Figure 16-5), enter the Goal URL, the name, and make sure the Active Goal 
is set to On. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Save Changes 
button. If you’d like to define a navigation funnel for that goal (an optional 
step), see the following section for details.
Defining a funnel
Google defines a funnel as “a series of pages leading up to the Goal URL.” 
Sometimes you won’t be able to define a funnel. Your visitors may choose 
their own path to a particular goal, or there may be many equally plausible 
paths to the same goal.
If the goal is a purchase, you can usually identify several required steps that 
must occur in order. Shawn Purtell of www.roirevolution.com offers the 
hypothetical example for an online cheese shop in Figure 16-5.
If you’re not sure of the path, set up your best guess as a funnel. Even if 
you’re completely wrong, you’ll see graphically how visitor behavior on your 
site deviates from the ideal.
Determining a goal value
If your goal is an e-commerce goal, a configuration beyond the scope of 
this book, leave the value blank or at $0.00. If the goal is a lead, a page 
view, or a download, you can estimate the value of that goal and input it 
in the Additional Settings section. For example, say you generated $24,000 
in income last month from 750 leads. Each lead is worth, on average, $32 
($24,000 ÷ 750 = $32). You can set the value of that goal at 32.00 (making sure 
to omit any currency sign), and then save your changes by clicking the Save 
Changes button.
E-commerce setup
If your Web site includes an e-commerce shopping cart, you definitely want 
to get it hooked up to Analytics. You’ll discover which keywords are making 
you money and which are not. You’ll find the optimal path for your AdWords 
visitors, from keyword through ad through landing page all the way through 
your site.

356
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
Figure 16-5: 
Configuring 
the funnel 
for a catalog 
request.
 
Unfortunately, there are simply too many variables for me to explain how to 
do it: brand of shopping cart, Web server, and so on. If you think you can 
configure it yourself, you can learn a lot from Google’s tutorials at www.
google.com/support/analytics. If you’re looking for a consulting 
company to set up your Analytics correctly, you can choose with confidence 
from Google’s own list of accredited Analytics partners, located at www.
google.com/analytics/support_partner_provided.html. Google 
vouches for all 25 (the current number of North American partners); I can’t 
speak highly enough about the talents of my Analytics advisor, Timothy 
Seward of ROI Revolution. Visit www.roirevolution.com to sign up for 
their free Webinar, get their newsletter, or pick up tips on their blog.
 
Actually, the fact that e-commerce Analytics is so complicated is a good 
thing — the harder something is, the bigger your competitive advantage when 
you implement. Analytics can provide you with black-belt skills in a white-belt 
world.

357
 Chapter 16: Making More Sales with Google Analytics
Making Sense of the Data
Analytics allows you to track much more than AdWords traffic, but if I got 
into the entire range of Analytics’ capabilities, this book could double as 
Weightlifting For Dummies. I’m going to limit this section to AdWords only, and 
ignore organic search traffic, banner ads, newsletters, offline promotions, and 
direct entries. But once you’ve mastered the AdWords part of Analytics, you 
will definitely want to explore the whole range of possibilities.
Checking for data integrity
Before studying your Analytics data, compare the number of clicks between 
AdWords and Analytics to see whether your Analytics profile is working 
properly. I once placed Analytics code on a redirect page and the actual 
landing page by mistake — and got reports of twice as many visitors as I 
actually received. Comparing the clicks in your AdWords control panel and 
your Analytics tables can tell you if there’s a problem but not what the 
problem is.
 
Shawn Purtell of ROI Revolution cautions that the numbers should be close, 
but probably won’t be identical. Analytics and conversion tracking handle 
repeat visitors differently, and if a visitor clicks today and converts in a week 
or a month, the data in the two systems will log those events in different time 
frames. As long as the data are basically telling the same story, you’re okay.
Viewing your data in the Dashboard
When your tracking is correctly set up and verified, it’s time to start amassing 
insights on your visitors’ behavior. From the Analytics tab in your AdWords 
account, click the View report link for the profile you want to examine. You’ll 
begin with the Dashboard, which you can customize by adding views that 
you’ll want to see a lot.
The Dashboard consists of, as you might expect, the just-the-facts graphs and 
charts that give you a quick picture of how your Web site is doing, as shown 
in Figure 16-6. It includes a graph of visits by day, as well as more in-depth 
information about those visits.

358
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
 
Figure 16-6: 
The 
Dashboard 
screen 
includes

information 
about your 
visitors.
 
Visits-by-day graph
You can play with the visits-by-day graph, which by default shows you the 
last 30 days of data, by clicking the arrow to the right of the second date. 
You can change the date range by length and start date by clicking a date 
(or several) in the Calendar view or by selecting (much easier and more 
elegantly) the Timeline tab above the calendar. Click your cursor inside the 
box and hold your mouse down to drag it backward or forward, or click and 
select either edge to expand or contract the date range.
Below the Date Range boxes is a check box labeled Compare to Past. Check 
that box to superimpose a previous date range over the current one. For 
example, you can quickly compare your Web traffic in May and March. 
Analytics will automatically generate a range of the same number of days as 
the current one.
Many other screens also feature a top graph similar to the visits-by-day 
graph, and you manipulate them all the same way — by changing starting 
and ending points and comparing two time periods.
 
Playing with Analytics is really simple after you’ve seen it done. Head over to 
http://askhowie.com/dates for a series of short video tutorials that will 
have you playing with your data in no time.
Site Usage statistics
The Dashboard shows you important data about how often your site is 
visited in the Site Usage section. The Site Usage section provides the 
following data:
 
✓ Visits, Pageviews, and Pages/Visit: Shows for a given period how many 
visitors came to your Web site and how many pages they looked at. In 
Figure 16-6, 667 visitors were served 1,797 pages over the 30 day period, 
for an average of 2.69 pages per visit.

359
 Chapter 16: Making More Sales with Google Analytics
 
✓ Avg. Time on Site: Shows how long the average visitor hung around 
your Web site before leaving. Figure 16-6 shows a time of 2 minutes, 33 
seconds.
 
✓ Bounce Rate: Google defines a bounce as a single-page visit. If people 
leave your landing page without going deeper into your site or opting 
in to a list, your landing page isn’t doing its job. Figure 16-6 shows a 
bounce rate of 63.72%, which means that the majority of visitors to this 
site are indifferent to the landing page, and I’ll probably never get the 
chance to do business with them.
 
✓ % New Visits: What percentage of your visitors have never been to 
your site before? (Remember, Analytics tracks computers, not people.) 
Figure 16-6 shows 80.66% of the visitors are new to your site.
Visitors Overview graph
The Visitors Overview graph shows you the number of unique visitors, 
rather than the number of visitors. If Sean from Toronto comes to your site 
on Sunday, Tuesday, and the following Saturday, that counts as three visits, 
but only one visitor (assuming, of course, that he used the same computer all 
three times).
 
The Visitors Overview and following sections can all be removed from the 
Dashboard by clicking the small X in the right-hand corner of the header.
Map Overlay
A world map shows you at a glance where in the world your visitors live. The 
darker the shading, the more visits from that location. Click on a land mass 
to zoom in to a continent. Keep clicking to go deeper, into countries, states/
provinces/regions, and cities.
Traffic Sources Overview
This graph shows you the comparative traffic production of direct visitors 
(those who type your URL directly into their browser), search engine traffic 
by engine, and other referring Web sites. Click the small View Report link for 
a detailed breakdown of which search engines and referring sites. Note that 
Analytics distinguishes between paid search (CPC) and organic search for 
Google, Yahoo!, and MSN.
Content Overview
You can see the five most viewed pages on your site, based on the number of 
pageviews (how many times visitors saw that page). The % Pageviews column 
shows what percent of all the pageviews on your site were generated by that 
particular page.

360
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
Goals Overview
The Goals Overview gives you a quick look at the number of visitors 
completing your defined goals.
The AdWords Campaign screen
In the Dashboard, you can see the number and percentage of visits generated 
by each AdWords campaign. Click the View Report link to go deeper into the 
AdWords reporting, the part of Analytics I describe in the rest of this chapter.
In addition to a link on the Dashboard, you can access this screen directly 
from the left navigation by clicking Traffic Sources, then AdWords, and finally 
AdWords Campaigns.
The top chart, as usual, shows visits over time. Below, a table segments your 
traffic by campaign and shows the number of visits, pages/visit, average time 
on your site, percentage of new visits, and bounce rate for each campaign. 
Click a campaign name to get the same information on the ad group level, and 
click an ad group to see the same data for each individual keyword. Figure 
16-7 shows how Analytics drills down into the French campaign (which cost a 
total of $74,544.64) to the Brie ad group (accounting for $40,164.41, or 53.88% 
of the total) and even deeper to the individual keyword brie (which cost 
$1718.42, or 2.31% of the advertising spending for the entire campaign).

361
 Chapter 16: Making More Sales with Google Analytics
If the traffic comes from the content network, it’s labeled (content targeting). 
You can search for specific keywords using the search box below the keyword 
list.
Clicking on an individual keyword brings up actionable data in three tabs:
 
✓ Site Usage tab: How visitors from that keyword behaved on your site: 
average time on site, bounce rate, pages/visit, and percentage of new 
visits. Interesting, to be sure, but the next two tabs will really blow your 
mind (if you’re into that sort of thing).
 
✓ Goal Conversion tab: How visitors from that keyword converted to each 
of your defined goals, and the goal value per visit (that is, how much the 
average customer who types that keyword is worth to you). Armed with 
this information, you can set your AdWords bids so that no keyword is 
costing you more than you’re making back on your site.
 
✓ Clicks tab: The monetary value of a click generated by that keyword: 
including total number of clicks, value of each click (RPC — Revenue-
Per-Click, the average revenue you received for each click based on 
e-commerce sales and the value you assigned to your goals), your profit 
(or loss) margin, and the overall ROI of that keyword.
Ad content segmenting
Choose Ad Content from the Segment drop-down list to see the same data, 
this time by individual ad. (You can find the Segment drop-down list above 
the Site Usage, Goal Conversion, and Clicks tabs.) Only the headlines are 
shown, so if you’re running different ads with identical headlines, you’re not 
going to find this particular view very useful.
Views
To the right of the Site Usage, Goal Conversion, and Clicks tabs, you find five 
views to choose from. From left to right, they are Table, Pie Chart, Horizontal 
Bar Graph, Comparison Against Site Average, and Mini-histogram (that’s a 
line chart, not a medical test).
Showing you all the views here would fill up another book. Check out 
www.roirevolution.com/graphs for a more in-depth discussion of the 
Analytics graphs. Play around with different segmenting options and views, 
and feel free to explore. You can’t break anything in the Analytics report 
section — it’s all read-only.

362
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 
The Keyword Positions view
From the left navigation, choose AdWords and then Keyword Positions. Below 
the obligatory line graph of visits over time, you see a list of your keywords, 
and the number of visits generated by each one. Click any keyword, and a 
magical view appears to the right of the keyword list. This view shows you how 
many clicks were generated by that keyword in each position on the search 
results page. The view itself is a mockup of the search results page, on which 
ads can appear on top of the organic results to the left (labeled Top 1, Top 2, 
and Top 3) or down the right side (labeled Side 1 through Side 10), as shown 
in Figure 16-8. You can use this information to find and bid on your keyword’s 
“sweet spot” on the search results page.
 
Figure 16-8: 
The 
Keyword 
Positions 
view shows 
which ad 
positions 
generate 
clicks for a 
given 
keyword.
 
You can also determine position for ads showing on the content network. 
If an advertiser runs an AdSense tower of five ads, your ad could be in 
positions one through five in that ad block.
Automating Analytics reporting
At the top of almost every screen, Analytics gives you the option to export 
or e-mail the results in one of four formats: PDF (for Adobe Acrobat Reader), 
XML (a Web language), CSV (for Microsoft Excel) and TSV (Tab Separated 
Values, for other spreadsheet applications). You can also add the view to the 
main Dashboard.
When you create an e-mail report, you can customize it and schedule it to be 
sent to whomever you want at regular intervals. You can even include a date 
comparison, so you can see changes in the key numbers each week or month. 
Under the Schedule tab, just check the box labeled Include Date Comparison.

 Chapter 16: Making More Sales with Google Analytics
Acting on Your Data to 
Make More Money
Throughout this chapter, I show you examples of data that you can act on to 
improve Web site conversion. In this section, I recap some of the low-hanging 
fruit that you can pluck with even a simple, non–e-commerce Analytics setup.
Optimizing your site for your visitors
The more you know about your visitors, the more successfully you can create 
a Web site that serves their needs and invites their business. Begin with the 
Web Design Parameters screen in the Webmaster view. View and print your 
visitors’ browser versions, screen resolutions, and connection speeds for the 
past week, month, and three months. Note the most popular types of each 
characteristic.
The next step will take a little work, but is well worth the effort. Go and 
navigate your Web site using the browsers, resolutions, and connection 
speeds used by your visitors. How long does your site take to load via dialup? 
What part of your landing page is visible on an 800 x 600 screen? What does 
your order form look like in Safari or Firefox?
If you interact with your site using only your computer, you have no idea 
what your visitors experience. Take the time to put yourself in their shoes, or 
on their mouse, and you may discover simple design tweaks that will double 
conversion literally overnight.
Improving site “stickiness”
If visitors leave your site after viewing only one or two pages, you may have 
a “stickiness” problem. A sticky site is one that keeps visitors engaged for a 
long period of time, so they have a chance to get to know you, find answers 
to their questions, and feel more comfortable with the idea of doing business 
with you.
The Average Pageviews per Visit metric, available on many screens, is a good 
indicator of how sticky your site is. If you spend all your energy on your 
AdWords campaigns yet lose visitors within a page or two on your site, you 
know where you need to improve.

From Timothy Seward of ROI Revolution: “To calculate your target for 
pageviews per visit, count how many pages it would take to complete the core 
goal of your site. For example, if your site is an e-commerce site, then count 
how many pages it takes from the home page to make it all the way to the 
receipt page. That resulting number is a good target to shoot for.”
Loyalty and recency
Loyalty refers to the number of times visitors return to your site. Recency, 
like it sounds, refers to how recently they’ve been back. Most successful 
businesses display high loyalty and recency metrics: Their customers come 
back again and again, and a large percentage of their customers have 
purchased recently.
Click Visitors on the left, then Visitor Loyalty, then Loyalty. You see a bar 
chart showing the number and percentage of visitors who have visited 
your site once, twice, three times, all the way up to 25–50 visits (as shown 
in Figure 16-9). If your online business depends on repeat customers to be 
profitable, you should improve the effectiveness of your e-mail follow up 
sequences and other means of generating repeat traffic.

majority of 
visitors to 
this site are

depends on

to be 
successful.
 
The report just below Loyalty is Recency. A healthy site attracts its visitors 
back at a regular interval, whether it is daily, weekly, or monthly. Figure 16-10 
shows a site that encourages visitors to return on roughly a bi-weekly or 
monthly basis. The site, www.peaceweavers.com, does so by means of a 
regular newsletter and an updated photo blog.

As AdWords matures and competition heats up, the value of the first transaction 
will trend toward break-even. If you want to be successful, you must cultivate 
recency and frequency in your customers. E-mail autoresponders and broadcasts 
(see Chapter 11), special events, teleseminars, referral contests, quizzes, new 
articles, and sales can all make your Web site a recurring destination rather 
than a one-shot deal.
Evaluating Web site changes
You can apply the date range comparison function to goal tracking and goal 
conversion. For example, say that you made a change to your opt-in landing 
page on July 1, and you want to determine the effect of that change. You can 
compare the goal conversion for your opt-in for July 1–30, compared to June 
1–30 of the same year.
In your AdWords Campaign report (or most other reports), first click the 
date range at the top right of the screen. Set the date range by clicking and 
selecting the start and end date, and then check the Compare to Past check 
box. By default, you see the previous week or month, depending on your 
current date range. To change the comparison range (for example, to the 
same month last year), choose the Timeline tab and drag the slider to the left 
until you reach the beginning of the comparison date range.
The graph now contains bars of two different colors, representing the 
different time periods. In Figure 16-11, the total number of visits and unique 
visitors were up from March to April, but the time on site, average pageviews, 
and bounce rate all got slightly worse. The owner of this site needs to spend 
more time improving the site, rather than generating new traffic.

Page and funnel navigation
The visually coolest part of Analytics is the navigation. You can see how 
visitors abandon the funnel you’ve defined, and where they go. You can also 
analyze any page on your site in terms of where visitors come from before 
landing on that page — and where they go afterward (shown in Figure 16-12).

 Chapter 16: Making More Sales with Google Analytics
Page navigation
Click Content from the left navigation. Identify your most viewed pages on 
the left, under the Top Content header, and click each URL to see how that 
page fits in your visitors’ navigation. You can learn how visitors found that 
page by clicking the Navigation Summary link. You’ll discover that some of 
your pages are sending visitors in the wrong direction, and you can take 
steps to correct the problem. You can make links bigger and more noticeable. 
You can move buttons and forms left or right, above the fold, or repeat them 
several times on a page. You can highlight text, use arrows or animation to 
draw eyeballs, or deploy audio or video.
Funnel Visualization
From the Goals section in the left navigation, choose Funnel Visualization. 
You can select any of your (up to four) goals. You will see how well your 
funnel moves visitors from entry to goal achievement, and where and why 
they are abandoning your funnel, as shown in Figure 16-13.
Timothy Seward offers the example of a detour from the shopping cart 
checkout page to the guarantee page instead of the completed sale. Upon 
discovering that, a clever merchant would add the guarantee to the checkout 
page and keep their visitors on track to a sale.

Reverse Goal Path
Also under Goals, check out Reverse Goal Path. This view shows you how 
visitors actually get to your goals; not what you think your funnel is, but what 
your visitors think it is. You may uncover your visitors’ unanswered ques-
tions and objections by studying the reverse path to each goal. If a lot of visi-
tors are coming through your privacy policy page, a page usually ignored by 
viewers, perhaps your site doesn’t seem trustworthy enough. You may want 
to add credibility elements such as logos, anti-spam assurances, and more 
professional design.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part covers important stuff that didn’t quite fit in 
the rest of the book. I gathered these tidbits and 
assembled them into top-ten lists.
I gathered the worst beginner’s mistakes I’ve encountered 
in my years as an AdWords consultant and coach for 
Chapter 17. Avoid these and you shave two years off your 
learning curve.
Chapter 18 contains case studies that highlight the 
principles revealed in this book. You find a broad range 
of businesses, challenges, and solutions that are meant to 
bring the concepts to life and inspire you to make your 
own AdWords success stories.
Because I had so much fun writing Chapters 17 and 18, I 
wrote two more top-ten lists and made them into Bonus 
Chapters 1 and 2. You can view and download these 
chapters as PDF files at http://askhowie.com/
bonuschapters.
In Bonus Chapter 1, I share a bunch of the online tools I 
use and recommend highly. Some are free and some 
aren’t; start with the free ones and then pay for other 
tools out of your AdWords profits.
Bonus Chapter 2 was my excuse to contact some of the 
best copywriters in the world and get them to return my 
e-mails. You get a first-class education from these tips on 
writing great Google ads.

The Ten (Or So) Most Serious 
AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes
In This Chapter
▶ Split-testing snafus
▶ Campaign calamities
▶ Ad agonies
▶ Keyword, er . . . problems
A
dWords can have a steep learning curve, as well as an expensive one. 
In this chapter, I quickly run through the most common and expensive 
mistakes I’ve seen as an AdWords consultant and fixer.
Neglecting to Split-Test Your Ads
Even the world’s best marketers are wrong more often than they’re right. If 
you run a single ad, the chances of that ad being the best of all the possible 
ads in the universe are laughably small. When you compare two very different 
ads head to head, one of them will almost always be better than the other — 
more compelling, more attractive, or more in tune with the innermost desires 
of your market.
When you’ve run the test long enough to have statistically significant data, 
you gracefully retire (or unceremoniously fire, whichever you prefer) the 
losing ad and put up another challenger. You continue the process, directing 
the survival of the fittest ad until you find the one unbeatable control that 
maximizes your business goals.
In the old pre-Internet days, split-testing was complicated and expensive, a 
high-level business process reserved for huge companies with giant mainframe 
computers and millions of dollars on the line. Now, Google AdWords makes 
split-testing as easy as sending e-mail; when I see advertisers neglecting this 
fundamental improvement strategy, I feel like the mom telling her kid to eat 

372
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
his peas because there are children starving somewhere else in the world. 
I want to shake them and shout, “Don’t you realize how lucky you are to be 
able to split-test so easily and cheaply and achieve such quick and conclusive 
results?”
If you aren’t split-testing at this point, contact my office. I’ll pack my 
WrestleMania Split Test Avenger outfit, fly (business class only, please) to 
your place of business, and shake some sense into you.
Practical advice:
 
✓ When you set up a new ad group, always have two different ads ready.
 
✓ Think of split tests as experiments you’re conducting to satisfy your 
curiosity. Keep a journal of questions, prioritize them, and always have 
another split test waiting in the wings.
 
✓ Split-test wide variations first, and then narrow down to smaller details.
 
✓ Check for statistical significance before declaring a winner. Don’t mis-
take randomness for rock-solid trends.
 
✓ Split-test landing pages and e-mail sequences as well as AdWords ads. 
With the right tools, these split tests are almost as easy as the AdWords 
split-testing interface.
See Chapter 13 for best practices in split-testing.
Letting Google Retire Your 
Ads without Testing
Another campaign setting that you need to override is the Ad Serving option 
in the Advanced Options section. From your campaign management console, 
click into a campaign and then click the Edit Campaign Settings link near the 
top. On the next page, Campaign Settings, find Ad Serving under Advanced 
Options (on the left). Do not optimize ad serving. Do not let Google show 
better performing ads more often. Instead, select the radio button next to 
Rotate: Show Ads More Evenly.
 
If you’re split-testing, you have two goals: You want to identify the winner as 
quickly as possible, and you want to learn something from the test that will 
help you connect better with your market.
When you let Google take control behind the scenes and quietly retire your 
low-CTR ads, you allow tests to drag on unnecessarily. It’s like holding a race, 
not specifying its length, and running it until the winner is miles away and the 

373
 Chapter 17: The Ten (Or So) Most Serious AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes
losers are gasping for breath at the side of the road. A much more efficient 
method is to establish a finish line and identify the winner as soon as the 
tape is broken. When Google retires your ads behind your back, you lose the 
market intelligence that your split tests often provide.
Finally, as I show in Chapter 15, the ad with the best CTR is often the least 
profitable. Yet Google chooses winners based on CTR, not conversion.
The only exception is when you turn on the Conversion Optimizer tool — in 
that case, you must keep the Optimize setting in your campaign.
Split-Testing for Improved CTR Only
Ads that generate high CTR can be wonderful. They attract more visitors 
to your site at lower cost, and rank higher than other ads bidding the same 
amount. They also teach you about your market’s desires and fears.
But when you split-test two ads and choose the winner based solely on CTR, 
you are in danger of worshipping a false god. Understand that the AdWords 
game is based on one rule: Get more outputs for your inputs than anyone 
else. Okay, CTR is a key throughput — but leads, customers, and dollars are 
what you’re after.
A mention of Paris Hilton in your ad text may generate a high CTR, but just 
like the old magazine ads with the four-inch red headline of the word “sex,” 
she may be attracting eyeballs belonging to nonbuyers. Remember that lots 
of clicks translate into lots of money for Google, not for you. Getting the right 
clicks is more important than getting lots of clicks.
 
When you split-test your ads, make sure you run conversion reports, and 
don’t rely on CTR alone.
Creating Ad Groups with 
Unrelated Keywords
The easiest way to set up an ad group is to write an ad, dump every keyword 
you can think of into that group, and send it to your home page. Heck, that 
should take you about 10 minutes of work if you’re using some of the powerful 
keyword tools I talk about in Chapter 5. It’s much more complicated and 
time-consuming to create tight ad groups, based on a narrow set of related 
keywords matched closely to the ads and the landing page. But your results 
will be well worth the extra time and effort.

374
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Keywords unrelated to ads and landing pages produce poor CTR and 
conversion results — and cost a lot of money because of the poor Quality 
Score penalty. Remember that each keyword represents a mindset; take the 
time to group your keywords by similar mindsets, and write your ads and 
landing pages to address the desires and fears attached to those mindsets.
You can tell when your ad groups are too broad if the CTRs of different 
keywords in the same group vary wildly. You may discover that the successful 
keywords are found in the ad headline and repeated in the description or 
URL. Peel the underperforming keywords out of that ad group and stick them 
into their own group, with an ad written just for them.
Muddying Search and Content Results
Many beginners rely on Google’s default settings when creating campaigns. 
Remember that Google’s defaults usually serve to simplify your account and 
to increase Google’s revenue. Sometimes those two goals are compatible with 
your goals, and sometimes they aren’t. One of the campaign settings you 
need to change right away, because you prefer profitability to simplicity, is 
Networks. (See Figure 17-1.)
 
Figure 17-1: 
Separate 
content

network

Campaign 
Settings 
page.
 
If you run all three streams of traffic (Google, search partners, and content 
network) through the same ad group, you lose the ability to distinguish 
among the very different kinds of traffic. Content network traffic consists of 
people who were interrupted while they were reading or surfing or watching 

375
 Chapter 17: The Ten (Or So) Most Serious AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes
something else. Search network traffic consists of people who are actively 
looking for your keywords. Not only do they arrive at your site driven by 
different motivations and desires; they respond differently to your ads and 
offers.
 
In many cases, content traffic overwhelms search traffic. When that’s true, you 
lose the ability to split-test ads properly; your accurate CTR and conversion 
data from the search traffic is drowned by the flood of content traffic. Figuring 
out what your market is telling you is like trying to hear a cricket at a heavy 
metal concert.
When you choose winning ads and identify profitable keywords based on 
poorly converting search traffic — and try to apply those lessons to your 
search marketing — in essence, you’re surveying penguins to try to sell to 
chimpanzees. The two market channels are very different, and should be 
studied and treated differently.
See Chapter 7 for detailed instructions on how to split Google, search 
partner, and content network traffic into three different campaigns.
Ignoring the 80/20 Principle
The 80/20 principle, applied to AdWords, states that the vast majority of 
outputs (impressions, clicks, leads, sales, and such) are caused by a very 
small minority of inputs (ad groups, ads, and keywords). Instead of diffusing 
your efforts, focus on the vital few rather than the insignificant many.
When you follow my advice and create Best Practice AdWords campaigns, 
you inevitably create a fair amount of complexity. With so many variables 
to monitor, juggle, and adjust, it’s common to become overwhelmed and 
wonder, “What do I do now?”
I often see consulting clients spend days massaging an ad group that has 
no potential to make a significant contribution to their bottom line, while 
ignoring the big keywords in the important ad groups.
 
Keep reminding yourself that the AdWords game is about maximizing outputs 
from fixed inputs. In this case, inputs are impressions and advertising cost. 
Spend your time fixing the things that will make the biggest difference:
 
1. Sort your campaigns by impressions.
 
2. Sort that campaign’s ad groups by impressions.
 
 Assess the ads in that group — do you have a clear winner?

376
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Sort keywords by impressions, and look at the top five keywords.
 
 Are they making you money? Do you need to adjust their bids? Peel and 
stick them into a new ad group? Pause or delete them?
Here the number of impressions is your limiting factor. If you have two 
ad groups, one with 50 impressions a day and the other with 20,000, a 
50 percent improvement in conversion might translate into one additional 
sale per month for the smaller group and one to two more sales per day for 
the larger group. Where do you want to spend your time?
One exception: you may be artificially limiting impressions in two ways:
 
✓ By ignoring potential high-traffic keywords
 
✓ By bidding for a position on page two or worse
Make sure you check your average position for each keyword, ad, ad group, 
and campaign before assuming you’ve maxed out its traffic.
Declaring Split-Test Winners Too Slowly
Once you set up split-testing, you want to identify winners as quickly as 
possible, so you can learn and improve faster than your competition. If you 
can double your CTR and maintain the same quality of traffic, you get twice 
as many visitors for the same amount of money. When you double your Web 
site’s traffic, you can run your landing-page and sales-page split tests twice 
as fast as well. The faster you split-test, the faster you improve.
I commonly look at new clients’ accounts and point out that they have been 
running a split test for weeks longer than they need to. Not only are they 
showing an inferior ad half the time, they’re also wasting the most precious 
resource of all: meaningful insights about their market.
 
Set up reports to run on a regular basis that just look at ad performance. 
Make it a habit to run the numbers through the statistical significance tester 
at www.askhowie.com/split and identify split tests that have yielded 
conclusive, action-producing results.
You can automate this process and receive e-mail notification of split-test 
winners by subscribing to www.winneralert.com.

377
 Chapter 17: The Ten (Or So) Most Serious AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes
Declaring Split-Test Winners Too Quickly
If your ad group receives a lot of traffic, your split tests may achieve statistical 
significance after only an hour or two. The problem with this speedy outcome 
is that the people searching during that particular window of time may be 
different from people searching at other times. If you choose a winner based 
on traffic from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. on Sunday, you may be picking an ad that has 
less appeal to people searching at noon on Wednesday.
To be safe, run each split test for at least a week, so you don’t put too much 
weight into a cyclical blip. You can run reports by date and time to identify 
differences in impressions, CTR, and conversion by day of the week and time 
of day.
 
If your weeklong split test threatens to become too expensive because of 
the volume of traffic, you can limit your traffic geographically by creating a 
campaign that targets a few low-population metropolitan areas but shows 
your ad 24/7.
Forgetting Keywords in Quotes 
(Phrase Matching) or Brackets 
(Exact Matching)
When you put a keyword in quotation marks, you tell Google that the quoted 
words or phrase must appear exactly as written somewhere in the keyword. 
Brackets are even more specific: They signify that the searcher must enter 
the keyword exactly as it appears within the brackets, with nothing added or 
removed.
When you use broad match keywords only (putting no quotes or brackets on 
the keyword), you don’t really know what your visitors actually entered as 
search terms. You lump many different searches into a big vague basket and 
miss some valuable market intelligence.
Phrase and exact match keywords often achieve higher CTRs than broad 
matches achieve because you can create ads that speak directly to the exact 
words and phrases that your visitors type.

378
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Because of the hierarchy among broad, phrase, and exact match keywords, 
be aware that phrase match keywords cannibalize their broad match 
counterparts, and exact match keywords steal impressions from both. If the 
CTRs differ among the three match types for high-traffic keywords, peel the 
underperformers and stick them into their own ad groups. (See more about 
keyword matching in Chapter 5.)
Ignoring Negative Keywords
Negative keywords keep certain searchers from seeing your ads. If you get 
significant traffic from broad or phrase match keywords, you may find that 
Google is matching your ad to some irrelevant searches. If you want to deter 
tire-kickers from costing you clicks, you may want to add negative keywords 
like free and complimentary.
If you target upscale buyers, you can improve your ROI by eliminating 
discount and cheap, as well as certain brand names that have low-end 
connotations. If some of your search terms are ambiguous (for example, 
anthrax refers to both a disease and a heavy metal band) or could refer to 
two different niches of the same market (auto glass and plate glass 
windows), save your click money by adding negative keywords to your 
keyword list.
Monitor your keyword-conversion performance over time to find new 
negative keywords. If you sell golf clubs and none of your golf instruction 
keywords convert, you can add instruction as a negative keyword.
Keeping the Keyword 
Quality Score Hidden
Google introduced the keyword Quality Score in 2006, without much fanfare 
or documentation. It’s often not even shown in the default ad group Keyword 
tab screen. You must add the Quality Score column to the Keyword tab to 
manage this crucial metric.
Quality Score tells you how much you must bid in order to show your ad 
for a given keyword. A low Quality Score puts you at a huge competitive 
disadvantage in your market; for this reason, I advise my clients to improve 
their Quality Scores before dealing with anything else on their sites or 
AdWords campaigns.

379
 Chapter 17: The Ten (Or So) Most Serious AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes
AdWords was the first advertising medium in the world to penalize advertisers 
for showing irrelevant content to their users. Their algorithms are based 
on years of comprehensive data collection — the keyword Quality Score 
contains information based on far more than your measly account. Ignoring 
it means you are missing the opportunity to make your sales process more 
customer-friendly and effective.
Activate the Quality Score column by clicking the Keywords rollup tab, 
clicking the Filter and Views button, and then selecting the Customize 
Columns link from the drop-down list. Check the box next to Quality Score 
in the Performance column on the left. If your browser isn’t wide enough 
to view the Quality Score column, you can click and drag the green Quality 
Score column up to the top of the green columns, so it appears next to 
Position Preference. Click the Save button to return to the keyword list.
Spending Too Much or Too 
Little in the Beginning
Marketing Consultant Joy Milkowski of www.getmoreaccess.com reminded 
me of another big beginner’s mistake: Over- or under-spending during the 
first weeks and months of your AdWords campaigns.
If you open your wallet too much by specifying too high a monthly budget 
or daily spend, you’ll lose all your money before you have time to learn the 
ropes. When you figure out that something isn’t working, turn it off right 
away while you make changes. Chances are — even with this book under 
your belt — you’ll take some time to get the feel of AdWords and develop 
proficiency. If you rush, you’ll blow through your budget several times and 
walk away going, “This stuff doesn’t work.”
If you ever took a driving lesson, you may remember that your instructor 
made you drive slowly for a long time, showing you how to steer and brake 
and stop fiddling with the radio dial, before ever letting you open up on a 
highway. Your AdWords budget is your MPH — take it easy until you learn 
how to drive safely.
Other clients are so hesitant that they set daily and monthly budgets far too 
low to generate enough traffic. They don’t get enough impressions to split-
test and improve their ads and keywords, and they give up in frustration. 
Without enough statistically significant data, they don’t know how to improve 
their campaigns and quit in frustration. That’s like learning to drive by never 
going faster than five miles per hour. The experience of going 55 MPH (or 85, 

380
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
which I wouldn’t know about, especially not on I-95 in Maryland just south of 
DC, I swear) is qualitatively and quantitatively different from inching along in 
an empty parking lot. The super-slow experience just doesn’t transfer to the 
real thing.
 
The happy medium involves setting a “learning budget” and sticking with it. 
Do your homework (see Chapter 4) to estimate the amount of traffic you can 
expect. Your advertising spend (as well as the daily or weekly attention you’ll 
need to give your account) depends on the velocity of that traffic. At first, 
don’t expect to make money, or even come close to breaking even. You’re not 
advertising to earn it back; instead, you’re running market tests so you can 
come out swinging when you open up your wallet and your traffic. Your goal is 
to get your ROI into the black within a few months.

T
he best way to see the strategies and concepts from this book in action 
is by viewing actual examples. I can’t show you all the details because 
successful advertisers guard their keywords, strategies, and metrics like 
the recipe for Coca-Cola. I’ve compiled case studies from consultants who 
hope you’ll think they’re clever enough to hire them, from clients who 
hope you’ll go to their Web sites and buy their products, and from friends 
egotistical enough to want to see their names in a book. Among these three 
groups, you’ll see enough gems to keep you busy for a while.
Using Sales Conversion Data 
to Save $14k per Month
A client who sells a consumer product online and doesn’t want to reveal 
its identity was spending about $35,000/month on AdWords. The client was 
tracking conversions but not the actual dollar amount of each sale. When we 
connected the shopping cart data to AdWords conversion tracking, we could 
now see the exact ROI of every keyword, site placement, and ad in the client’s 
account.
We began collecting data on February 7, 2008. I started split-testing ads at 
that point. After 3 weeks, I ran a keyword performance report and paused 
negative ROI keywords. I ran a placement performance ad and excluded the 
negative ROI placements. I ran an ad performance report and deleted the 
inferior ads.

382
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
As you can see from Figure 18-1, the client’s AdWords spend dropped sig-
nificantly, but their total sales remained the same. Before, they spent $35 
to make $100. After, they spent only $20. In their case, that amounted to a 
monthly savings of almost $14,000.

Here’s the really cool thing about this case study. Go back to the first 
paragraph and read carefully what I did. Notice: There was no creativity 
involved. No new ads. No clever keyword variations. No insightful market 
analysis. Just looking at each element and asking, “Is this paying for itself?” 
And when the answer was no, out came the axe.
Going Global and Tracking 
Conversions with Analytics
Shane Keller of www.gcflearnfree.org, a non-profit organization that 
offers free online computer, technology, and life skills training to help people 
improve their lives, visited my office on May 8, 2008. We talked for a while, I 
looked at his AdWords campaigns, made a few suggestions, and he left. 

383
 Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) AdWords Case Studies
Shane shared his actions and results on August 15, 2008. Here are the 
relevant excerpts:
After I met with you, I came back and we adjusted our campaign setting to target 
a worldwide market instead of just the US. The AdWord campaigns exploded 
into action. We started maxing out our budget by noon every day. Now, finally I 
could start to see how each test and adjustment affected the results.
I worked the system — outlined in your book — each and every day and saw 
immediate improvements week after week. This led to a run of seven 
consecutive record-breaking weeks of stats for our website, the adoption of 
Google Analytics to track our conversion rate.
Week of April 28–May 4
Week of June 16–June 22
Clicks = 3,935
Clicks = 7,177
Imp = 101,625
Imp = 80,639
CTR = 3.42%
CTR = 8.93%
We added Analytics the week of July 7th – July 13th. Now it was all about the 
conversions. We now have a conversion rate of 15.42% on our AdWords 
campaign. We are averaging around 6,600 new unique signups each week and 
we’re now heading into what’s typically the busiest period for us. Here is a 
screen shot of our website signup growth. (See Figure 18-2.)

Throwing a Bigger Party with Broad 
Match and Negative Keywords
David Rothwell of www.adwordsanswers.com took over the AdWords 
account of a client, www.perforce.com, which provides versioning and 
collaboration tools and systems for software development companies. When 
David took over the account, the main challenge was the lack of traffic. 
Originally, the account had been set up with thousands of long-tail (three- to 
five-word) keywords to take advantage of the low bid prices. The trouble 
was, keywords like “embedded software development tool” and 
“software development management tool” were getting almost no 
searches.
David relaxed the keyword specificity; began using more common, shorter-
tail keywords, such as version control, software configuration 
management, and software configuration tools; and put them into 
lots of tightly focused ad groups. 
Because they were now bidding on common keywords in broad match 
format, they had to pay attention to the searches they no longer wanted. 
David did so by running the search query report on a regular basis, and 
adding negative keywords to the appropriate ad groups. For example, 
“kitchen design software” and “website design software” both 
showed up, so -kitchen and -website were both added to the software 
design group.

385
 Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) AdWords Case Studies
David reports that long-tail keywords, once a best practice, appear to be 
losing their effectiveness because Google prefers to show ads for keywords 
with significant search volume. After all, if nobody’s searching, then nobody’s 
clicking, and Google isn’t making money.
Results: Perforce had been frustrated by their inability to spend more money 
on AdWords. As they offer a fully functional two-user free trial software 
download, the targeted search traffic they get converts quite well.
Once David added conversion tracking and removed the negative-ROI 
keywords and ads, not only did the impressions and CTR increase, but also 
cost per lead went down. As an added bonus, the extra traffic now allows 
for more robust split-testing of landing pages, including new ones with video 
demos.
Originally, the AdWords account had targeted only the United Kingdom. 
Perforce is building on the success of the UK-based campaign to roll out 
campaigns in Germany and Sweden.
Getting Cheap and Hungry Traffic by 
Bidding on Your Own Brand Name
Christian Bedard of www.calimacil.com sells high-end and high-quality 
form swords for live action role-playing aficionados. Christian thought he had 
tapped out all the potential keywords in the swords, shields, and live action 
weapons department, but recently, he had a brainstorm and bid on the keyword 
Calimacil and headlined the ad “Calimacil Official Site.” (See Figure 18-4.)

He got this idea not from a competitor in his industry, but from copying the 
AdWords strategy of Dell Computers. (See Figure 18-5.) One of the smartest 
things you can do as an AdWords advertiser is to pay attention to what other 
advertisers are doing that catches your eye when you’re searching. Most 
innovation is just borrowing a good idea from somewhere else and applying it 
where it has never been applied before.

the idea for 
its ad from 
this Dell ad.
 
Even though the Calimacil listing comes up at the top of the organic listings 
for the keyword Calimacil, the ad and organic listing combined generate 
more traffic and sales than just the top organic listing by itself. Rather 
than cannibalize the free clicks, the sponsored link reinforces Calimacil’s 
domination of the page. The ad’s CTR is 26%, with a very high sales 
conversion rate, and very low bid price because there are no competitors.
Adding a Welcome Video 
to the Landing Page
Ken Evoy, president of www.sitesell.com (a turnkey Web hosting and 
e-commerce business-building system), thought that he had fully optimized 
his Web site conversion process through years of comprehensive testing. 
Nothing he tried could beat his control site. But he found that adding a 
short, friendly Welcome to My Website video to his home page dramatically 
increased sales for his Site Build It! service. The video helped increase sales 
by 30 percent by explaining the product and building an emotional connection 
with visitors.
With the help of Web video consultant Joe Chapuis of www.webvideozone.
com, Ken created a 3-minute video shortcut for the SiteSell homepage that 
walks prospects through a quick tour of his site and service. Ken explained, 
“Site Build It! is a big product that takes a lot of words to explain. Video 
enables us to get so much more information across so much more efficiently.”
Ken added the video to the top of his home page, using the Flash video 
player available at www.webvideozone.com. Joe Chapuis explained the 

387
 Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) AdWords Case Studies
importance of video placement: “If you want someone to watch your video, 
you need to have it at the top of the page where it will get noticed, as well as 
on a Web page that prospects are likely to visit.”
Ken reported that sales increased by 30 percent since he added video to the 
home page: “Video is incredibly powerful, especially for a product like SBI. . . . We 
have never been able to communicate so precisely, effectively, nor with such 
emotion.”
Getting the Basics Right
Kelly Conway kindly saved me several hours of work by providing the 
following case study. Notice the simple steps that cumulatively produced 
stellar results.
I met David O’Hara, a product-development expert, when he was looking for 
help in selling one of his products, the Breatheasy blood-pressure reduction 
system, via PPC advertising. David’s goal for this ad campaign is to drive visitors 
to a landing page where he makes a one-time sale of either a CD or downloadable 
product. Two landing-page examples include www.highbloodpressurehq.
com and www.highbloodpressurehq.com/about_me.html
The campaign includes 30–40 ads, which we continuously split-test. Examples 
include:

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The state of the ad campaign, at the time that David contacted me, was similar 
to many other campaigns I’ve seen. He was bidding on 600–800 keywords, all of 
which were in a single ad group. None of the keyword phrases was making use 
of anything other than Google’s broad-match option. David’s initial request was 
to get the minimum cost-per-click of many of his keywords below the $1 and $5 
Google was requesting.
Improve Web Site to Increase Keyword Quality Score and Lower Bid 
Prices
The campaign’s overall CTR had been around 0.50%. My immediate goal was 
to raise that number dramatically. I knew by doing that, I would be able to 
decrease the minimum bid and our average CPC. The initial cost per click was 
$0.23. However, David still had hundreds of keywords he wasn’t bidding on due 
to the $1 and $5 minimum-bid requirements. In addition, I recommended that 
David add content to his Web site so that Google would find his keywords more 
relevant. He went to work on that while I worked on increasing the CTR.
Add Quotes and Brackets to Every Keyword
First, I created phrase- and exact-match versions for every keyword in the 
campaign. Those keyword variations often have less competition, which 
means their bid prices can be lower. Additionally, they often attract better-
targeted visitors than the broad-match versions of the same phrases.
Delete Poorly Performing Keywords
Next, in order to quickly raise the campaign’s CTR, I needed to delete the 
keywords that were performing poorly. I deleted phrases that, after 200 or 
more impressions, had resulted in no sales and had not achieved at least a 
0.80% CTR.
Interim Results after Two Weeks
Implementing these strategies helped us increase the campaign’s cumulative 
CTR to 1.02% by the end of the second week. Additionally, we managed to lower 
our average CPC by nearly 10%, to $0.21, during that period. By the end of the 
first month, our overall CTR was 1.67%. Google reported our average ad position 
for the first month as 5.6; indicating that our ads appeared, on average, in fifth 
or sixth position within Google’s sponsored listings.
Segment Keywords into Ad Groups
The next step was to segment the keywords into groups of related phrases. 
This work was time consuming, but not difficult. I reviewed all of our keywords 
and identified 18 targeted groups. For example, a person searching for 
“hypertension cure” may have a very different mindset from someone who 
searches for “lower blood pressure quickly”, though both are good 
prospects for David’s product. Segmenting the overall market allowed us to write 

389
 Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) AdWords Case Studies
specific ads targeted to the apparent internal dialog of each person searching 
for a solution. A valuable side benefit of this exercise was that the resultant shift 
in perspective from the market as a whole to market segments allowed us to 
unearth additional search phrases that doubled the size of our keyword list.
Continued Split-Testing
We had, of course, been split-testing ads all along. One particular ad (the first 
one displayed above) had consistently out-pulled all contenders. In the new 
groups, we split-tested that control ad against ones specific to each group’s 
market segment. In about half of the cases, the control ad still won; proving that 
you never know what will work best until you test. We continue to write market-
specific ads and split-test them against the control, however, and new winners 
emerge each week.
Discouraging Unqualified Traffic
In the interest of increasing sales conversions, we took a few actions that 
reduced our CTR. For example, as soon as we got the overall CTR above 1%, 
we introduced several negative keywords (such as “-free”). This combination 
of forward and backward steps resulted in an overall CTR of 3.88% over the 
first five months of the campaign. At that point, several of our ad groups had 
achieved a CTR over 4%; the highest was 4.98%. Dozens of specific keyword 
phrases garnered double-digit CTR.
Current Results
In summary, over the first five months of this campaign, we increased the CTR 
by 597% (0.65% to 3.88%), while reducing the average CPC 22% (from $0.23 to 
$0.18) and maintaining an average ad position just over 5; as low as 3.5 in one 
ad group. Additionally, at the 5-month mark, no keyword phrase had a minimum 
bid amount over $0.40. As a result of all this work, David’s blood pressure is 
even lower today than when we started.

15-Cent Click to $1,700 
Customer in Minutes
Mike Stewart of www.internetvideoguy.com doesn’t spend hours creating 
new ads or designing amazing Web sites. He doesn’t research hungry markets 
or spend hours creating long e-mail follow-up sequences. He buys cheap 
clicks on AdWords on keywords related to recording teleseminars and phone 
calls. He split-tests his ads but doesn’t generate enough impressions to make 
significant changes very often.

390
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Mike’s landing page (at www.teleseminartools.com) features a prominent 
2-minute video commercial for a home talk show recording studio priced at 
$1,695. The video cost almost nothing to make, compared to tens or hundreds of 
thousands of dollars for television commercial production. But the decreased 
quality doesn’t matter on this site, because the AdWords traffic is so highly 
qualified. A commercial airing during a break in The Office is shown to 
everyone watching the program; only a tiny percentage of the viewers will 
be interested in a given product at a given time. That’s why commercials on 
mass media need to be repeated so often. But a commercial on an AdWords 
landing page can specifically respond to the itch represented by the keyword.
For the low-traffic keyword teleseminars and its variations, Mike generated 
134 clicks at $0.15 CPC over a 3-month period, for a total advertising spend 
of around $20.00. These clicks generated 13 sales totaling more than $22,000 
over the same period. Mike cautions that these numbers are possible for two 
important reasons:
 
1. The keyword teleseminars generates a customer who is likely to be 
qualified for the offer.
 
2. The product for sale lends itself to a video demonstration.
Mike teaches others how to create inexpensive Internet commercials at 
www.internetvideoguy.com.
Local Search with Video Web Site
One of Mike Stewart’s clients is www.carpetdepotdecatur.com, a local 
carpet store in Decatur, Georgia. The owner, Brad Flack, bids on about 30 
keywords in the Atlanta market only, and drives traffic to a Web site that uses 
video to introduce the store and answer frequently asked questions. The ads 
are simple, and include the call to action, watch online video.
The video on the home page features Brad introducing himself and explaining 
the benefits and dramatic differences of his store. He guides visitors to click 
the “Deal of the Week” video, view customer testimonials, and meet the staff. 
He also invites them to call and shows them where to find the phone number, 
and demonstrates how to shop on the site. The most significant call to action 
is for the visitor to view the “Measure Your Home” how-to video. 
Customers now come to the store feeling like they already know Brad from 
viewing several minutes of video. He has stopped running ads in the Yellow 
Pages because most customers use Google first and some rely on online 
search exclusively. Because none of his competitors is advertising with 
Google at this point (and he hopes they don’t read this book!), his ad is the 
only one that prospects see. With no competition, clicks are cheap and his 
number-one position is guaranteed.

Generating B2B Leads 
without Cold Calling
Joe DiSorbo of www.webgistix.com uses the Web to generate targeted 
business-to-business leads for e-commerce companies who want to automate 
or outsource the packing and shipping of orders. Because his service is a 
complex business-to-business sale, he uses the Web strictly to generate 
leads. Joe explains how he went from AdWords zero to hero in 12 months by 
employing very basic strategies:
Prior to using AdWords, we engaged in the painfully slow process of surfing the 
Internet, locating a potential target (an existing e-commerce company), finding 
their contact information on their Web site, and then cold-calling them to pitch 
our services. We opened an AdWords account in May 2005, made a list of all 
possible keywords, and got started.
Our first 12 months using the system can be broken into 3 distinct 4-month 
periods with significant jumps in CTR.
Phase 1 — The Beginning (May 2005 through Aug 2005)
Impressions: 146,028
Clicks: 467
CTR: 0.32%
CPC: $0.71
During the first four months, we established two things:
 
1. People were actually searching online for fulfillment services and 
clicking our ad.
 
2. We didn’t yet know how to attract and convert enough prospects to 
make AdWords cost-effective.
We started with a single campaign that contained a single ad group. That ad 
group consisted of every related keyword we could think of (broad match only 
and a single ad). When we ran a new ad, we shut off the original one. We didn’t 
know how much the campaign was going to cost so we limited our daily budget 
and kept our bid prices low, which gave us a low position. Over that period, our 
highest CTR was 0.77%.
The good news was that prospects were in fact clicking on our advertisements 
and coming to our Web site. Some even filled out a form and requested more 
information. Once we had their information, we could call them back. These 
calls were much easier to convert to sales than the cold calls we had been 
making previously.

392
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Phase 2 — The Big Leap (Sept 2005 to Dec 2005)
Impressions: 169,616
Clicks: 2,583
CTR: 1.52% (376% increase over Phase 1)
CPC: $1.62
During the second 4 months our AdWords efforts started to pay off. Beginning in 
September 2005 our CTR increased to 1.52%. We had significantly more people 
visiting our Web site and were converting more of them to sales. Over that 
period we tried various ways to increase our response rates. Three tactics in 
particular improved our campaigns the most:
 
1. We got rid of the poorly performing and non-related keywords. 
This lowered our overall impressions but improved the connection 
between keywords and the ad.
 
2. We broke out like words into their own ad group so we could custom-
ize each headline for each set of keywords.
 
3. We began split-testing ads.
Because these changes were working well, we added new keyword groups in 
November 2005. Impressions rose along with CTR as we applied our newfound 
skills to the new ad groups.
Phase 3 — Continuous Refinement (Jan 2006 to Apr 2006)
Impressions: 393,021
Clicks: 10,990
CTR: 2.80% (83% Increase over Phase 2, 774% increase over Phase 1)
CPC: $1.23
In January 2006, our CTR took another big leap upward. We had been split-testing 
vigorously for the past 4 months and refining our ad groups and keywords. The big 
leap came when we tested a display URL that matched, or was closely related to, 
the search term the person typed in. Now, both the headline and the display URL 
were related directly to what the person was searching for.
Up to this point, we had been using our corporate domain, Webgistix.com, only. 
Once we started using targeted URLs, we again saw a big increase in CTR. We 
went out and bought all the URLs we could that were related to our industry and 
started using them in the display URL for our top search terms. These included:

393

Fulfillment Center 
www.FulfillmentCenter.biz
fulfillment costs 
www.fulfillmentcosts.biz
kitting 
kitting.biz
pack and ship 
packandship.info
literature fulfillment 
literaturefulfillment.biz
ecommerce fulfillment 
ecommercefulfillment.biz
In addition to customized display URLs, we set up Web sites with those URLs to 
act as landing-page gateways to the main www.webgistix.com site. We 
optimized those Web sites for different keywords, creating, in effect, landing 
sites instead of just landing pages. We kept the corporate logo at the top, but 
the important text and URL reflected the keyword. The Web site http://
fulfillmentcenter.biz is optimized for the keyword “fulfillment 
center”.
This change increased our Web-site conversion from 1% to 3% instantly, without 
any split testing.
The overall business result has been 80% sales growth three years in a row.
Understanding and Answering 
Customer Objections
Jaco Bolle of www.savefuel.ca sells a small generator that can be installed 
in cars and trucks to add hydrogen gas to the engine for better gas mileage 
and lower emissions. When he came to me for help in improving his Web site 
conversion, he faced several marketing challenges:
 
1. Very few people have heard of supplemental hydrogen.
 
2. Most people are skeptical when they hear that they can improve their 
gas mileage by adding hydrogen to their gas tank.
 
3. People associate hydrogen gas with the Hindenburg disaster and are 
scared to generate it near their vehicle engine.

394
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Through informal market research (talking about the product with everyone 
we could find and reading posts in online forums dedicated to hydrogen 
technology and fuel savings), we identified these and other objections that 
were preventing sales. Then we put together a nine-day e-mail course, titled 
“Supplemental Hydrogen Secrets Revealed.” Each day addresses a different 
objection head-on — educating and entertaining the reader, building a bond 
of trust, and moving them closer to buying.
The first e-mail has the subject line, “Hydro-Gen, Iran, and Poison Ivy.” It lists 
the big benefits of hydrogen supplementation, includes several testimonials, 
and is chatty and engaging. The references to Iran and Poison Ivy in the 
subject line, which were included to pique curiosity and get the e-mail read, 
are echoed in this text from the e-mail:
For most of us, saving money and time (fewer fill-ups) is a pretty good motivation 
all by itself. But in this case, there [are] a couple of very strong “non-selfish” 
reasons to want to consume less fuel.
Everyone has a different take on world politics, but I’ve never met anyone who 
thought that the U.S. should become more dependent on Middle Eastern oil. It’s 
a little crazy to think that we’re worried about Iran’s nuclear program and that 
we’ve been funding that program at the pumps for years.
And I don’t know about you, but I’m starting to believe the signs of global 
warming. There [have] been reports on the news about poison ivy plants growing 
faster and being itchier as the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise.
On the third day, we tackled the big objection: safety. An excerpt from the 
e-mail, titled “The Hindenburg, Die Hard, and Sad Toddlers: Is Hydrogen 
Safe?” follows:
Of course, we get a lot of questions at SaveFuel.ca about the Hindenburg. People 
want to know, “Is my car going to burst into flames over central New Jersey if I 
install a Hydro-Gen unit?”
It’s a good question. It’s the first thing I’d ask before installing anything in my 
car: Is it safe?
First of all, nothing is without its hazards. Forks, staplers, bicycles, cars, toasters — 
they all can be misused in dangerous ways. So the real question is, Is the 
Hydro-Gen safe if used properly?
Here’s why the Hydro-Gen is safer than the gasoline or diesel you currently use:
+ + + Hydrogen is less of a fire hazard than gasoline + + +

395
 Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) AdWords Case Studies
The Hydro-Gen uses a small amount of electricity to turn water into its two 
component elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is much less flammable 
than gasoline. Gasoline bursts into flames at anywhere from 228–501 degrees 
Celsius (442–933 degrees Fahrenheit), while hydrogen doesn’t ignite until 550 
degrees Celsius (1,022 degrees Fahrenheit).
All those scenes in the Die Hard movies where the car flips over and bursts into 
flames — that’s ordinary gasoline, not hydrogen. Now, cars don’t actually burst 
into flames very often in real life, but still — gasoline is far more likely to ignite 
than hydrogen gas.
Here’s another thing: If you were ever forced to memorize the first row of the 
periodic table, you’ll recall that hydrogen is the first — and therefore lightest — 
element. How light? Fifteen times lighter than air. Twice as light as helium.
Did you ever give a helium balloon to a small child at the amusement park? 
And they let go? That balloon really took off, didn’t it? Next time you comfort a 
sad toddler about the loss of their helium balloon, imagine a balloon twice as 
buoyant in air, filled with hydrogen.
Because it’s so light, hydrogen disperses upwards. Quickly. It doesn’t stick 
around and burn, like gasoline does. If you watch a video of the Hindenburg 
fire, you’ll notice something amazing: That giant ship burns hydrogen only for 
30 seconds. Rescuers run to the scene almost immediately.
(Check it out yourself in this video: http://tinyurl.com/lue73)
Here’s a startling fact: 62 out of 97 passengers on the Hindenburg survived the 
disaster on May 6, 1937, many of them relatively unharmed. The ones who died 
either fell, or were burned by dripping diesel fuel.
Note the chatty yet authoritative tone, the use of story to make the point, and 
the non-salesy nature of the e-mail. This e-mail ends with a by-the-way call 
to action: “ . . . if this e-mail has just put your mind at ease regarding safety, 
here’s the link to order a Hydro-Gen and get started saving gas and money 
right away: www.savefuel.ca/oxy-hydrogen.”
Another e-mail addresses concerns about the unit voiding a vehicle’s warranty 
or harming the engine. Day 5’s installment answers the objection, “This 
sounds too good to be true. If hydrogen supplementation works, then the big 
car companies would be using it.”
Slowly, the autoresponder sequence answers objections, provides more and 
more testimonials, explains the technology, and culminates with an ironclad 
risk-reversal guarantee. Borrowing language from a Robert Collier sales 
letter of the 1930s, we write, “By ordering, you obligate me, not yourself. If it 
doesn’t work the way I say it will, I insist that you return the Hydro-Gen for a 
full and prompt refund.”

396
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The result of this e-mail sequence, coupled with several other improvements to 
the site, including tested headlines, the addition of live chat, and live phone 
operators available 20 hours per day, was a doubling of the site conversion, 
from roughly 1.75% to 3.5%. Jaco relates that a competitor approached him in 
despair, asking whether he would consider selling the competitor’s product 
on the www.savefuel.ca Web site.
Making Money in an Impossible Market
David Bullock of www.davidbullock.com believes so strongly in rigorous 
testing of the sales process that he decided to put his methodology to the 
test in a nearly impossible situation: buying AdWords clicks for $0.25 and 
sending the traffic to a Web page promoting an affiliate product that produces 
$4.25 per unit sale for David. In order to break even in this scenario, David’s 
site needed to produce one sale for every 17 clicks. In other words, if the 
affiliate site — over which he had no control — could convert a very healthy 
5% of its visitors to paying customers, David could not have made money on 
the front end, even if he had been able to send every single visitor to that 
site!
His goal for the campaign was a net profit of $30/day, stable and predictable. 
He gave himself one advantage: He chose an inexpensive product with built-in 
continuity — an impulse purchase that would lead customers to buy more 
over time.
During the intense testing phase, David limited his Web site traffic to 100 
clicks per day. His conversion at the start of the experiment was 2%: one sale 
for every 50 visitors to his site.
Task #1: Lowering the bid price
The first task was to lower the bid price. At a quarter a click, there was no 
way to turn this campaign into a financial success. David employed two 
strategies: improving the ad CTR and firing underperforming keywords.
He employed Taguchi multivariate testing to find the ads with the highest 
CTR. Taguchi testing uses matrices to create several ad variations at a time, 
simulating the actual testing of thousands of ads. This method works only 
with a very significant traffic stream. If you only get a few hundred impressions 
per week, Taguchi testing will actually slow you down. From an initial figure 
of 0.25% in January 2006, David’s CTR rose to 0.95% in February, 1.25% in 
March, and 1.73% in April. It now holds steady at approximately 2.00%, an 
eightfold improvement.

397
 Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) AdWords Case Studies
Second, he tracked his initial list of 335 keywords, and fired words that 
weren’t leading to sales. Ultimately, the campaign contained only 85 
keywords. David’s CPC is now $0.12, less than half its original cost.
Task #2: Improving Web site conversion
David focused his tests on three elements of his landing page: the headline, 
the presence or absence of a photograph of the product, and the text on 
the page. The original headline was “How to Buy X.” The eventual winner 
became, “How to Get X without Any Hidden Harmful Y” (sorry, he’s not going 
to reveal the product or the Web site).
He found that an image of the product improved conversion, and that a 
long-copy Web page did better than a short-copy Web page. Once the page 
format was established, David performed Taguchi testing on the first few 
paragraphs of the copy to establish the right words in the right order.
Now the site sends 50 percent of its AdWords visitors straight to the affiliate 
site where they can purchase the product. One visitor out of every 24 makes 
a purchase. His overall conversion rate from click to sale is 4.37%, significantly 
higher than the breakeven requirement of 3.32%. And because of the continuity, 
the back-end profits make the site even more lucrative. In April 2007, David 
spent $109 on AdWords and earned $1,122 in affiliate income. Additionally 
(he’ll be embarrassed for me to reveal), it took over an hour for him to look 
up all these numbers because he locked down this campaign over a year ago 
and hasn’t touched it since.
A single AdWords campaign to a single Web page selling a product he doesn’t 
make, stock, or ship — and it pays the mortgage month after month. All 
because David focused on the fundamentals and tested and tracked his 
results rigorously.

AdWords Terms
Ad position: The placement of an ad on the Google search results pages. Position #1 is at the top of the 
first page.
Bid price: The maximum amount of money an advertiser is willing to pay for a click from a given keyword.
Call to action: Directions within an ad or a Web page for the reader to take an action.
Conversion: A desirable action by a Web-site visitor, including joining a mailing list, buying a product, call-
ing a phone number, or downloading a file.
CPC (cost per click): The amount an advertiser is charged for a single click. Different keywords cost dif-
ferent amounts, depending on competition.
CTR (click-through rate): The number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of impressions. The 
higher the CTR, the more effective Google considers the ad.
Impression: The display of an ad on a Web page.
Landing page: The first Web page shown after an ad is clicked. The page is constructed to appeal to the 
same desire as the ad. 
PPC (pay per click): The advertising model that charges advertisers only when their specific ads are clicked.
Split test: Test that divides online traffic randomly between two or more creative approaches (ad, Web 
site, e-mail, and so on) and measures which one generates more conversions.
Traffic: The number of visitors to your Web site.
Visitor value: How much money, on average, a single visitor to your Web site is worth.
Landing Page Elements to Test
 ✓ Headline: Use the results from your ad split tests to inform different headlines. Proclaim a big benefit, 
ask a question, start telling a story, make a scary prediction, and so on.
 ✓ Offer: Do your visitors prefer an e-book, a newsletter, a minicourse, a sales quote, a CD, a return phone 
call, a cheat sheet, or a suitcase filled with unmarked $100 bills? (Just kidding about the suitcase.)
 ✓ Location of opt-in form: Try the opt-in form on the right or the left, above the scroll, every four 
paragraphs, and so on.
 ✓ Graphics: Test different photos of the product. Add shadow. Make the pictures bigger or smaller. 
Experiment with removing the header graphic. Try different colors and fonts for text and hyperlinks.
 ✓ Background color: Try lighter or darker colors, warmer or cooler, with or without repeating 
background graphics.
 ✓ Multimedia: Test adding audio or video to your page to orient, instruct, and win over your visitor.

Campaign-Optimization Tips
 ✓ Separate Google, Search Partners, and Content Network traffic into different campaigns. Keep your 
traffic streams separate so you can track the visitor value from each stream individually; optimize your 
sales funnel for each group.
 ✓ Create tightly focused ad groups with closely related keywords. Avoid sloppy ad groups with thousands 
of words all pointing to some loosely related ad. Group common desires and mindsets; send each to a 
targeted landing page.
 ✓ Place underperforming keywords in new ad groups and optimize the ads for those keywords. If one 
of your top traffic keywords in an ad group is getting a significantly lower CTR than the rest, move it to 
its own ad group and write an ad with that keyword in the headline (and perhaps in the URL).
 ✓ Build ad groups with enough traffic to split-test in a timely fashion. Don’t take too long to declare 
split-test winners.
 ✓ Add long-tail keywords to decrease CPC and increase traffic. Three- and four-word phrases tend to 
have less competition and represent buyers rather than lookers.
 ✓ Focus your energy on the changes that will make the biggest difference. Before managing and optimizing 
your account, sort campaigns, ad groups, and keyword lists by impressions. Start where the most traffic is 
so your improvements lead to increased or more qualified visitor flow.
