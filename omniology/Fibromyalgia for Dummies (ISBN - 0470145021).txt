About the Authors
Roland Staud, MD, is a rheumatologist and a professor of medicine at the
University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, as well as a noted and interna-
tionally renowned medical researcher. Dr. Staud’s continuing and cutting-
edge research on fibromyalgia is supported by the National Institutes of
Health and other funding organizations. His research has clearly demon-
strated that patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) have detectable cen-
tral nervous system abnormalities of pain processing resulting in increased
pain sensitivity and prolonged pain experiences.
Dedicated to helping FMS patients by sharing his knowledge as much as pos-
sible, Dr. Staud is greatly appreciated by attendees at major national and
international fibromyalgia and arthritis conferences, where he is a frequent
speaker. He is also on the editorial boards of Pain and European Journal of
Pain. In addition, he is a reviewer for the Clinical Journal of Pain, Journal of
Pain, European Journal of Pain, and Pain. He has authored many medical jour-
nal articles on fibromyalgia and other topics.
Dr. Staud is a diplomate of the American Board of Rheumatology and the
American Board of Internal Medicine. He is a member of the American
College of Rheumatology, the International Association for the Study of Pain,
the American Pain Society, and the International MYOPAIN Society. Dr. Staud
is licensed to practice medicine in Florida.
Christine Adamec has been a freelance writer for more than 20 years, con-
centrating on self-help and medical/health issues. She has authored or co-
authored 14 books, including The Encyclopedia of Diabetes (Facts On File,
Inc.) and How to Stop Heartburn (Wiley), and has written numerous magazine
and newspaper health features. Ms. Adamec is a member of the American
Society of Journalists & Authors.


Dedication
Dr. Staud: I would like to dedicate this book to all the fibromyalgia volunteers
who participated in my studies at the University of Florida, helping me to
characterize the abnormal pain mechanisms of fibromyalgia syndrome.
Christine Adamec: I would like to dedicate this book to my ever-patient hus-
band, John Adamec.

Introduction
F
ibromyalgia is a chronic medical problem that can be terribly aggravat-
ing and sometimes even maddening for people who have it, especially if
they aren’t receiving the latest medications or treatments, such as those dis-
cussed in this new edition of Fibromyalgia For Dummies. But if you have
fibromyalgia, you may find comfort in the fact that you’re not alone.
Fibromyalgia affects 6 million or more people in the United States and mil-
lions more in other countries. You can also find comfort in the fact that many
effective options may help you significantly decrease the problems that
you’re experiencing, problems that stem from fibromyalgia.
Also known as fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), fibromyalgia’s major symptom
is pain in the muscles, tendons, and bones throughout the body. (And for
some people, the pain and its location vary from day to day.) FMS pain often
occurs without a specific cause or injury. In other cases, it may be linked to
an injury (such as from a car crash), may be tied to a traumatic event (such
as past physical or sexual abuse), or may be connected to combat experi-
ences (such as in the Iraq War or past service in Vietnam).
Yet some people, including some doctors, persist in thinking that fibromyal-
gia is just another word for hypochondria — or maybe even slacker or goof-off.
They think that people who say they have fibromyalgia symptoms are really
lazy or crazy — or both. They dismiss FMS as just another “disease of the
month.”
They’re wrong. The pain isn’t imaginary, and the problem is no fad. At the
University of Florida, I’ve conducted studies that have proven that subjects
diagnosed with fibromyalgia suffer heightened pain sensitivity and low pain
threshold, and that they retain their pain longer than those individuals with-
out the syndrome.
It’s true that if fibromyalgia sufferers can be depressed, anxious, or stressed,
they’ll feel worse. But depression, anxiety, and stress don’t actually cause
fibromyalgia. People with FMS will have pain whether they’re upset or not.
But their pain often increases when they’re distressed.
What does fibromyalgia feel like? Many people say that to truly understand how
FMS can be experienced, you need to imagine how you feel when you have the
flu. Recall the aching and pain in parts of your body or in your entire body.
Then multiply those achy feelings by about ten times. Now imagine feeling that
way nearly every day. That is what fibromyalgia feels like for a lot of people.
Pretty nasty.

2
Fibromyalgia For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
The good news is that you can feel much better with both the traditional and
alternative medications and treatments, as well as with the lifestyle choices,
that I describe in this book. They work for other people, and they can help
you (or someone you know who suffers from FMS), too.
About This Book
Although this is a new edition, my two primary goals in writing this book
remain the same:
 I want to show that fibromyalgia pain is real — and now there’s more evi-
dence than ever to help me prove that. This goal is important because
some doubters are still out there.
 I want to discuss the pain of FMS and provide the most current information
on medications, alternative remedies, lifestyle changes, and other 
treatments that work.
You don’t have to read this book from the first page straight on through to
the end — although you certainly can if you want to. You may instead want to
read Chapter 1 to get a feel and flavor for the rest of the book. Then you can
use the table of contents at the front of the book or the index in the back to
help you move on to the chapters that interest you the most.
Also, keep an eye out for the many personal stories that I’ve sprinkled
throughout the book. These anecdotes come from real people who suffer
from fibromyalgia.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses and e-mail addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 I use bold to highlight the action parts of numbered steps or keywords
in bulleted lists.
 Sidebars, which are enclosed in a shaded gray box, include information
that may fascinate you but that isn’t critical to your understanding of FMS.
Also, you may have noticed that two names appear on the front cover, but I
use the singular pronoun I in the text. I do so because this book reflects only

my views as a medical professional, while Christine Adamec, an experienced
medical writer, assisted with the preparation and production of the book.
Thus, she’s also credited on the cover.
What You’re Not to Read
You can read this book in any order you want, dipping into it to find the informa-
tion you need and then moving on. You can safely skip the sidebars (text in gray
boxes); they contain interesting information, but they’re not critical to the sub-
ject at hand. Finally, you can skip any text marked by the Technical Stuff icon
(for more on this icon, see “Icons Used in This Book,” later in this Introduction).
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I’m making some basic assumptions about you. I’m
assuming that:
 You have fibromyalgia, think that you have it, or you have a friend, child,
teenager, or other family member with FMS, and you want information in
order to be able to help.
 You want information on pain relief and remedies.
 You’re curious about alternative remedies and treatments, and want to
know what works and what to avoid — and you need some basic guide-
lines on how to know the difference.
How This Book Is Organized
Fibromyalgia For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is divided into seven convenient parts,
starting with what fibromyalgia is, moving to who’s most likely to have it, and
zeroing in on the many ways to deal with the pain, fatigue, and other common
symptoms that fibromyalgia sufferers share. Here’s how it breaks down.
Part I: The What, When, and 
Why of Fibromyalgia
In the first four chapters, I cover the realities of fibromyalgia. I offer a self-
test, in case you need help in determining whether you may have FMS. The
various symptoms of fibromyalgia are important to understand, and I cover
3
Introduction

them in detail in Chapter 2. I also talk about possible causes of fibromyalgia
in Chapter 3. Nobody knows exactly what causes FMS, but there are some
intriguing theories about the perpetrators of this medical problem (such as,
it may be in your genes). Chapter 4 covers pain and its purpose, including
good pain and bad pain. Most fibromyalgia pain is bad pain, so don’t imagine
that I think otherwise, because I don’t! However, you need to manage FMS
pain, instead of having that pain manage you.
Part II: Finding Out Whether 
You Have Fibromyalgia
To know whether you may have FMS, it helps to consider patterns found among
people already diagnosed. You can still have FMS even if you don’t fit neatly
into one or more of these categories, but it’s less likely. I cover this information
in Chapter 5. Then, moving to Chapter 6, I describe medical problems often
confused with fibromyalgia, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, myofascial pain
syndrome, arthritis, lupus, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and thyroid disease. Some
people have more than one of these medical problems — I hope you won’t
have “all of the above.” Next, Chapters 7 and 8 walk you through working with
your primary-care doctor, and, if needed, finding a new physician.
Part III: Looking At All Your 
Treatment Options
Here’s where I talk about what to do about your fibromyalgia. In Chapter 9, I
cover over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, guaifenesin, and dex-
tromethorphan, as well as different categories of medications, such as antihis-
tamines and topical remedies applied to the skin. And I describe the full gamut
of prescribed remedies for FMS in Chapter 10, including some new medica-
tions that you need to know about. I then talk about some hands-on therapy
that can help you, such as icing or heating the painful spots or applying direct
massage to your hurting areas, in Chapter 11.
In Chapter 12, I cover alternative remedies and treatments that may help you
feel better, such as herbs, supplements, Botox treatments (not just for facial
wrinkles anymore!), acupuncture, tai chi, and other complementary medicine
choices, as well as some treatments that you really should steer clear of and
some advice on how to tell the good guys from the scammers out there.

Fibromyalgia For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: 
Small Changes, Big Results
You can make some nonmedical lifestyle changes to ease your pain. In
Chapters 13 and 14, I tell you how you can control stress using relaxation
therapy, hypnotherapy, meditation, and yoga, and provide details on how to
get a good night’s sleep. In Chapter 15, I include important information on
exercising, losing weight, and making key dietary changes that may help con-
siderably. In Chapter 16, I cover dealing with the emotional fallout of FMS,
and, if you need a therapist, I offer advice on finding a good one.
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia 
at Work and at Home
You can’t switch FMS off and on (if you could, it’d always be in the off posi-
tion!), so the illness affects you both at work and at home. In Chapters 17 and
18, I discuss how you can help your family, friends, co-workers, and even your
boss to help you. Sometimes, work may become impossible, and you may need
to apply for a disability — an important subject I also cover. I offer Chapter 19
for those who don’t have FMS themselves, but who have a friend or family
member who’s hurting — and whom they want to help. I also include a chapter
on children and adolescents with fibromyalgia, in case your child, or the child
of someone you know, suffers from FMS.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part presents helpful information in lists of ten items each. You can read
about ten pieces of advice on remedies related to fibromyalgia. Another list
offers ten mistakes to avoid when you have FMS. I also have ten ways to beat
brain malaise (fibro fog). Last, I debunk ten myths about FMS.
Part VII: Appendixes
In this part, I provide a glossary of commonly used terms related to
fibromyalgia. I also offer an up-to-date appendix of over-the-counter (OTC)
drugs and prescribed medications that are useful to many patients with FMS.
I include the brand and chemical names of the drug, common starting
dosage, symptoms it combats, and side effects.
Another appendix is an Internet resource guide of interesting Web pages
where you’ll find resources and articles to read as well as support groups to
5
Introduction

contact online. And, in case you’re not a Nethead, I offer an appendix of help-
ful organizations to contact through the mail. I also provide a list of publica-
tions devoted to fibromyalgia.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you remember the important points of each chapter, this book marks
certain paragraphs with the following helpful icons:
This icon denotes critical information that you really need to take away with
you. Be sure to read it.
When you see this icon, you find a helpful hint for coping with fibromyalgia
that may save you time or money. Or maybe both!
The Warning icon cautions you against something that’s potentially harmful.
Be sure to read and heed these icons.
When I get a bit technical on you, I use this icon. You can safely skip any
paragraphs marked by the Technical Stuff icon — of course, if you read them,
you’re sure to discover something interesting.
Where to Go from Here
After you’ve read this book and started using my suggestions to begin your
journey to less pain and better health, I hope that you’ll experience the con-
siderable improvement that many others have felt. In particular, I hope you
maintain your personal commitment to managing your own health. I also
hope that you’ll be well armored against attacks from people out there who
somehow still (and wrongly!) think that fibromyalgia is fake. Fibromyalgia is a
real medical problem; it’s not something that’s in your head. But it’s also a real
medical problem that you can successfully control.

Part I
The What, When,
and Why of
Fibromyalgia

In this part . . .
F
ibromyalgia is a real medical problem — no matter
what you may have heard from other people 
(including some doctors!) who act as though they know
what they’re talking about. Fibromyalgia isn’t “just in your
head” — actually fibromyalgia pain and tenderness are
usually spread throughout the entire body!
In Part I, I describe the key aspects of fibromyalgia that
you need to know, such as exactly what fibromyalgia is
and what the major symptoms are. I include a fibromyalgia
self-test that you can take. I also discuss intriguing theories
on why you and others may have developed fibromyalgia.
I cover car crashes, infections, autoimmune systems 
run amuck, traumatic experiences, genetic predisposi-
tions, and other theories. Pain is the main problem with
fibromyalgia, and I devote an entire chapter to this topic
(quite painless to read), which I hope will provide good
insight into what’s actually going on with your poor
aching body.

nowing that fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a real medical problem that
needs to be dealt with is an important first step toward mastering your
fibromyalgia — and moving toward that place where you can start to feel like
you’re making progress. Sure, you can try to ignore the problem. But mostly,
it won’t let you.
Fibromyalgia has many aspects to consider. In this chapter, I line up the
major issues for you and refer you to chapters later in this book where I dis-
cuss how fibromyalgia affects you individually and what treatments and med-
ications may work best for you.
Dumping Your Doubts about 
Whether FMS Is Real
Many people spend months or years questioning their fibromyalgia symptoms,
sometimes wondering if they’re imagining how bad the symptoms are. After all,
if you feel terrible one day and then significantly better or almost normal the
next day, you may start to think that maybe you were exaggerating the pain
and fatigue of the previous day.
The thing is, most people can’t remember pain well. They can remember 
that they had pain, but they can’t remember what it actually felt like. (This is

10
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 
generally a good thing!) As a result, people experiencing the ups and downs
of pain and other symptoms that accompany fibromyalgia worry sometimes
that perhaps the problem isn’t that big of a deal and could even be all in their
heads. Consequently, they may try to ignore the problem and hope that it’ll
go far, far away — preferably today.
But if you have fibromyalgia (and I recommend that you take my self-test
later in this chapter to see whether you could be a possible candidate),
simply ignoring the problem doesn’t work. The sooner you acknowledge that
fibromyalgia is a real and long-term problem, the sooner you can work
toward reclaiming your life.
You can gain enormous control over the symptoms that stem from your
fibromyalgia, but only rarely can you eradicate them altogether. Most people
have plenty of room for improvement, however.
Examining the Symptoms, Causes, 
and Pain Problems Associated 
with Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia isn’t a one-size-fits-all kind of medical problem, but I can make
some descriptive generalizations about it regarding symptoms, causes, and
pain.
Sizing up the symptoms
Many people with fibromyalgia report that the following statements are true
about their fibromyalgia symptoms. In fact, most people with fibromyalgia
say that they have at least several, if not all, of these symptoms (which I
cover in much more detail in Chapter 2):
 Flu-like pain that can be severe
 A constant feeling of extreme fatigue
 Several tender body areas that hurt
 Overall body aches
 Depression and/or anger
 Feeling very anxious
 Muscle stiffness and pain
 Chronic back pain

 Insomnia
 Worsening of pain after physical activity
 Mental malaise and confusion, often referred to as fibro fog
Many people with FMS have other pain-based medical problems as well,
which I also cover in more depth in Chapter 2. Some examples of the array of
medical conditions that people with fibromyalgia may experience, on top of
the fibromyalgia that they already have (as if FMS isn’t enough), include
 Restless legs
 Irritable bowel syndrome
 Interstitial cystitis (a chronic, painful bladder condition that may feel
like a constant bladder infection)
 Tension headaches or migraine headaches
 Benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS; an often painful form of
hereditary joint hyperextension)
 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
 Chronic fatigue syndrome
Considering causes
No one knows for sure what causes fibromyalgia, but physicians and other
experts have many fascinating theories to explain what may induce the onset of
FMS. The cause could be hormones or an autoimmune problem or biochemicals
gone awry, chronic stress, or it may be related to a previous trauma, such as an
injury that you incurred in a car crash or in another serious accident. Individuals
who have been abused as children or adults are more likely to develop
fibromyalgia than others.
The cause could also be a combination of different factors coming together at
just the right time (or the wrong time when you think about it) for you to
develop FMS. For example, maybe you got the flu, and then were involved in
a serious accident. Or some other awful combination may have occurred.
As researchers (like me) continue to study this medical problem, they move
closer to the truth. Speculating about causes can be fascinating, and Chapter
3 offers some common theories for what causes fibromyalgia.
Pondering pain
Thinking about pain is certainly no fun, and yet pain is part of what makes 
us alive and human. But when pain runs rampant in our bodies, extracting
11
Chapter 1: Yes, Fibromyalgia Is Real

particular pain in certain parts of it, it becomes a major problem, and
fibromyalgia pain can be very intense. I talk about the purpose of pain and how
and why it needs to be managed in Chapter 4. It may sound like a chapter to
avoid, but hold on! You need to read it because it includes some important
and useful ideas.
And by the way, I’m not just saying that I believe that the pain and symptoms
of fibromyalgia are real because I’m a nice guy who doesn’t want to hurt your
delicate feelings. I think that I am here to help you, but even more important,
I’m a physician who’s a clinical researcher, and I’ve proven in my studies on
the pain of people with fibromyalgia that their pain (and yours) is real.
My studies, as well as the studies that have been done by other researchers,
have shown that the pain sensations experienced by people with fibromyal-
gia (especially women) are actually more intense, and the pain lasts longer
than does the pain of people who don’t have fibromyalgia. Read Chapter 4 for
further information on the ins and outs of fibromyalgia pain.
Considering Who Gets Fibromyalgia
Just about anyone of any age can develop fibromyalgia, but most research so
far indicates that the majority of people with FMS are of the female persua-
sion, partly because women are more sensitive to pain than men. This is a
time where a little equal opportunity of pain would be preferable (if you’re a
woman). But who gets fibromyalgia isn’t about fairness.
Although women are the primary sufferers of fibromyalgia, many men have
been diagnosed with FMS, too, and some men with fibromyalgia go undiag-
nosed for years. For more information about some of the major patterns that
have been identified so far among people who develop fibromyalgia, which
you may share with these fellow sufferers, be sure to read Chapter 5.
What about children and adolescents? Do they have fibromyalgia? Sadly, yes.
If your child or teenager has FMS, he may have a difficult time because most
physicians, as well as the general public, still don’t realize that kids can expe-
rience chronic pain from FMS. Instead, they think kids are faking it when they
say that they’re too sick to go to school. Maybe they are, but then again,
maybe they’re not. Skip ahead to Chapter 20 for some advice on how to tell
the difference.
Looking at Related Medical Problems
Sometimes, people strongly suspect (or are sure) that they have fibromyalgia.
Instead, however, they may have arthritis, Lyme disease, lupus, thyroid 
12
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

dysfunction, Raynaud’s phenomenon, or a variety of other common and not-
so-common medical problems. And sometimes people have both fibromyalgia
and other serious medical problems. Having fibromyalgia doesn’t exempt you
from getting sick with other illnesses (even though it seems like it would be
only fair that it should).
With the existing array of possible medical problems and their often-
overlapping symptoms, even doctors can become confused sometimes about
which is which when they’re working on a diagnosis. A good doctor is up to this
task, of course, as long as you don’t expect instant results on your first visit.
For example, suppose that one of your primary symptoms is extreme fatigue,
possibly to the point of total exhaustion — even though you haven’t been
doing anything more strenuous than using the remote control to change
channels. This action may use up one calorie or less, but you feel like you’ve
climbed Mount Everest. Maybe your problem is fibromyalgia, but maybe not.
Extreme tiredness is one of the possible symptoms of many medical prob-
lems, including hypothyroidism, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme dis-
ease, arthritis, and — oh, yes — fibromyalgia, too. No wonder sorting it all
out can be so hard sometimes! To find out more about illnesses often con-
fused with FMS, and how doctors sort them out, read Chapter 6.
Do You Have Fibromyalgia? A Self-Test
Only your physician can diagnose you with fibromyalgia and then treat you.
Reading this book is a very good idea, but it still doesn’t really cut it when it
comes to making an actual diagnosis in your own individual case. What I can
give you is a simple self-test to use to help you determine if you may have
fibromyalgia syndrome.
Grab a scratch piece of paper and jot down your answers to the following
“yes” or “no” questions. Then, read my analysis at the end of the list. If you
think that you may be a possible candidate for fibromyalgia, make an
appointment with your physician and find out for sure.
1. Do you have a lot of pain in certain specific areas of your body? If so,
do these areas lack any obvious damage (such as bruising or
swelling)?
2. Is your overall body pain sometimes severe?
3. Do you have trouble sleeping on three or more nights per week?
4. Do you feel exhausted about half the time or more?
5. Do people often say that you look sick?
13
Chapter 1: Yes, Fibromyalgia Is Real

6. Do you turn down social invitations rather than risk having to go out
feeling achy and tired?
7. Do you find yourself wondering whether your aches and pains will
ever go away or if you’ll feel like this forever?
8. Are you always losing things and forgetting things? Do you have so
much mental confusion that you sometimes wonder if it could be an
early onset of Alzheimer’s disease?
9. Are you having trouble finding any real pattern to your pain —
because some days it’s bad and some days it’s not?
10. Have you started to feel “down” about your pain and fatigue? Are you
wondering whether depression could be the underlying problem?
If you answered “yes” to as many as three or more of these questions, you may
have fibromyalgia, although every person’s case is different. That’s why even if
you only answered “yes” to one or two of the questions, but you think that you
may have fibromyalgia, a consultation with your physician is a good idea.
Now, here’s some explanation of what may be happening to you, depending
on your answers to Questions 1 through 10. Keep in mind, though, that only
your doctor can actually diagnose you with fibromyalgia.
 Question 1: If you’re experiencing pain in specific parts of your body,
but you’re not seeing bruises or any apparent evidence of tissue damage
(and neither is your doctor), these painful areas may be the muscle
pains characteristic of fibromyalgia. Read Chapter 8 for more informa-
tion on tender points.
 Question 2: If you said that your pain is sometimes very severe, this is
another indicator that you may have fibromyalgia. Be sure to consult a
physician to find out.
 Question 3: If you have trouble sleeping three or more nights per week,
this is serious. The problem may or may not be connected with
fibromyalgia (although nearly everyone with FMS has sleep problems),
but it’s important to resolve your serious sleep deficit. If you’re a walk-
ing zombie because you’re not getting enough sleep, you can’t perform
well at work or home, nor will you be a happy person.
Also, if you’re prone to developing fibromyalgia, this continuing bad pat-
tern of a lack of sleep every night will make your other symptoms, such
as your pain and fatigue, much worse.
 Question 4: Severe fatigue is a chronic problem among nearly everyone
who has fibromyalgia. Often, it’s linked to a lack of sleep. But it may also
be an element of FMS as a medical problem. You may also have chronic
fatigue syndrome or thyroid disease, and your doctor will need to help
you sort it out.
14
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

 Question 5: If you agreed that those you care about, or maybe even
strangers around you, are commenting that you look sick, something about
you probably doesn’t look right. You may be displaying your chronic pain
and associated depression on your face without even knowing it.
On the other hand, other people tell individuals with fibromyalgia that
they look “fine” and “great,” and the pain and symptoms are not
reflected in the face or body language of the fibro sufferer. If this has
happened to you, you’re definitely not alone.
 Question 6: If you’re turning down invitations that you would have
accepted in the past, have a serious talk with yourself to find out why. Is
it because of pain and fatigue? Or could you be having a problem with
depression or anxiety — both very common problems for people with
and without fibromyalgia?
 Question 7: When your pain is constant and chronic, asking yourself if it’s
ever going to end is only natural. But what you need to do is consult with
a physician. You may have fibromyalgia, or you may have another prob-
lem altogether. Don’t wait for the pain to magically disappear. Take action.
 Question 8: If you constantly lose things or forget things, you may have
the “fibro fog” that often stems from fibromyalgia. You may also have
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Another possibility is
that you may have neither of these but you’re simply trying to do too
many things at once, and you need to take some things off your plate.
How do you know which it is? You make a stab at analyzing what you’re
forgetting and when. If you can’t even begin to do that, and you’re also
experiencing chronic pain, fatigue, and sleep problems, you may have
fibromyalgia. But see your doctor to find out for sure.
 Question 9: If your pain is severe on some days and then far less of a
problem on other days, and you think there doesn’t seem to be any pat-
tern to it at all, you may be experiencing the chronic ups and downs of
fibromyalgia.
Pain that can appear in one part of your body one day and migrate else-
where on another day is a common symptom of FMS, as are days when
you feel really bad and other days when you feel only mildly bad.
 Question 10: If you don’t seem to enjoy anything anymore and maybe
are sort of overwhelmed by your many aches and pains, you may have
depression. Many people with fibromyalgia have both depression and
FMS. You could also have a problem with an anxiety disorder, such as
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), where you are overwhelmed with
extreme worry.

Chapter 1: Yes, Fibromyalgia Is Real

But before rushing off to the nearest psychiatrist to ask for the latest
antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), as a first step, consider talking to your regu-
lar doctor or to a pain specialist. Why? Your primary problem may actu-
ally be fibromyalgia, and if your medical problem is treated and then
your symptoms subsequently improve, so may your sad mood. Many
doctors prescribe antidepressant medications to treat pain and FMS. Get
more details on this in Chapter 10.
This test is just a starting point. If you’re really concerned that you may have
FMS and/or another chronic illness, make an appointment with your doctor.
Finding a Doctor Who’s a “True 
Believer” in Fibromyalgia
Although I believe that most well-educated physicians are at least aware of
the existence of fibromyalgia and its basic symptoms, and also know that it’s
a valid problem that needs to be treated, I also know that a few doctors out
there still haven’t gotten the word yet. If your doctor isn’t helping you with
your FMS symptoms, you need to help him understand it. Taking this book to
your appointment and showing him what you’re reading is a good start.
A good doctor will consider your symptoms as valid, take a complete medical
history, and perform a physical examination. Read Chapters 7 and 8 for more
details.
Sometimes, no matter what you do, a particular physician isn’t working out
for you. Maybe the two of you have a personality conflict, or maybe he thinks
that you should just tough out your fibromyalgia. Or maybe the problem
stems from something else altogether. Whatever it is, sometimes, you just
need to find a new doctor. (I’ve devoted a significant part of Chapter 7 to help
you find a new doc, if that’s what you need to do.)
After you find a good doctor who’s interested in working with you, she can
formulate a plan for you to follow — one that’s doable in your life. Usually,
such a plan involves medications to take (over-the-counter and/or prescribed
drugs and, sometimes, supplements or alternative remedies, too), as well as
advice on basic lifestyle changes that you can make to improve your health.
Some of these lifestyle changes may involve foods to eat or avoid (for exam-
ple, foods high in caffeine may make you feel worse), exercises to perform,
and other therapies that may improve your symptoms.
16
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Treating the Problem
When you have fibromyalgia, at least some of the time you may want to take
some medications, whether they’re over-the-counter drugs; prescribed med-
ications, such as muscle relaxants or painkillers; or other medications such
as prescribed or over-the-counter topical ointments that can help to ease
your pain and symptoms. I cover these topics thoroughly in Chapters 9 and
10. You can also often gain benefit from hands-on therapy, including heat, ice,
and massage therapy, all covered in Chapter 11.
And don’t forget about the promise of alternative remedies! People with
fibromyalgia have some very intriguing choices to consider, including acupunc-
ture, acupressure, biofeedback, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and neuro-
feedback. Read more details about all these different choices in Chapter 12.
Making Lifestyle Changes: Pulling
Yourself into a Non-Fibro World
As you work to pull yourself farther back into the non-fibromyalgia world,
you may sometimes feel like a person loaded down with 50 pounds of extra
weight, trying to slog your way through the swamp. During your struggle you
watch others on dry land with no heavy packs dart by you, maybe waving at
you and telling you that they’ll see you later.
If you want to improve your quality of life and be able to reduce your back-
pack of troublesome symptoms, consider the following basic ideas:
 De-stress yourself. Stress is a normal part of life, but if you have
fibromyalgia on top of the usual daily stresses, or maybe with some
extra stress thrown in once in a while, you’re in a bad situation. Stress
can greatly worsen the chronic pain, fatigue, and other symptoms of the
person with fibromyalgia. Be sure to read Chapter 13 for my suggestions
on relaxation therapy, hypnosis, meditation, and other methods to “de-
stress” yourself. They work!
 Improve your sleep to decrease your pain. Don’t kid yourself. Five or
even six hours of sleep each night aren’t enough. So, if insufficient sleep
is a problem for you, as it is for many people with fibromyalgia, face up
to it. You may need medication (such as a sleep aid or an antidepressant
or anti-anxiety medicine), an alternative remedy (such as valerian or
melatonin), or another form of treatment to solve this no- or low-sleep
problem that you’re going through. Read Chapter 14 for some ideas on
how to resolve sleep problems and help yourself feel better.
17
Chapter 1: Yes, Fibromyalgia Is Real

 Exercise. Unless you’re an exercise-aholic, you probably don’t much like
the idea of exercising (most people don’t), and the mere thought of it
may be nearly migraine inducing for some readers. But the fact is, aero-
bic exercise will usually help you to limber up and lose weight, making
you more mobile and also helping you to feel better. So consider “getting
physical.” Read Chapter 15 to find out more about the benefits of exer-
cises and for some specific, FMS-friendly exercises you can try.
Exercise shouldn’t hurt a lot, nor should it be really unpleasant and
something to dread. If you hate swimming or bicycling, don’t use those
activities as your exercises. Maybe walking would suit you better, or
maybe dancing or some other form of aerobic exercise with your part-
ner or a friend. You can exercise in many different ways: Be creative and
find the best ways for you.
 Pay attention to your emotions. Stress isn’t the only problem that
people with fibromyalgia often face. Depression and anxiety are also
very common, and they may be problems that you face. These problems
are treatable and, in Chapter 16, I talk about how to know if you may
have a problem, and how to identify a good therapist to help you, if you
need one.
Coping with Fibromyalgia 
at Home and on the Job
Unfortunately, fibromyalgia doesn’t end at 6 p.m. or whenever you arrive
home from work, nor does it go away when you wake up in the morning,
struggling to get ready for another day at work or at home. When you have
FMS, it’s always there on the sidelines, waiting to jump on you yet again with
its aggravating symptoms.
You also need to keep in mind that other people you interact with on a daily
basis (your partner, children, friends, co-workers, and other family members)
are directly affected by your fibromyalgia, even if they don’t have FMS 
themselves.
Virtually anyone you interact with on a regular basis needs some understand-
ing of what you need from them, whether you tell them that you have
fibromyalgia or not. (Some people with fibromyalgia tell everyone that they
have “arthritis” because they think that it sounds better.)
18
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Even as you become more aware of your symptoms and how best to resolve
them, you still have to deal with the “non-fibro” world, comprised of your
family members who don’t have fibromyalgia, your fellow workers, and many
others you interact with. You need to develop workable strategies to cope
with these varying situations and come up with a winning game plan for your
life. I cover these topics in Chapters 17 and 18.
Working with fibromyalgia at work
Many people with fibromyalgia continue to work full-time or part-time,
despite their pain and fatigue. They struggle with what to do when their
symptoms make it hard to continue to work.
Many people worry about whether they should tell others at work about
their FMS, whom they should tell, what they should say, and so much more.
In Chapter 17, I provide a thorough overview of these issues and how they’ve
affected real people. I also include advice from an attorney expert in getting
people with FMS approved for Social Security disability.
Handling fibromyalgia with 
family and friends
Even the most loving family members and friends usually don’t really under-
stand fibromyalgia if they don’t have it themselves. And even if they do have
FMS, too, their symptoms may be very different from what you experience,
and the intensity of their symptoms may be better or worse than the way
your symptoms grab hold of you.
As nice as it would be if this were true, the reality is that fibromyalgia isn’t a
quickie one-time explanation. For people to understand what your problem is,
especially the people with whom you share your home and your life, helping
them get a clue about what you’re going through and what you need takes a
lot of work.
You have to be candid, and you also need to know how to respond to the dumb
things that people often say to people who have fibromyalgia. Read Chapter 18
for more information on how (and also how not) to explain fibromyalgia to
your children of all ages, your partner, and other family members and friends,
so that they can better understand what’s really going on here.
19
Chapter 1: Yes, Fibromyalgia Is Real

Don’t miss the information that I provide on sex and fibromyalgia for readers
who are sensing that their partners are maybe feeling a teensy bit deprived in
this area of life. (Thinking about sex when you hurt is a hard thing to do, but
it’s not hard for your non-FMS partner to think about it. Finding common
ground is a good idea.)
Sorting it out when you don’t 
have fibromyalgia
Maybe you don’t have fibromyalgia, but you live with someone who does,
and you really want to understand the problem and to help as much as possi-
ble. But where do you begin? Not to worry, I’ve provided a chapter just for
you — Chapter 19.
This chapter describes techniques to assist you in helping your friend or
loved one deal with FMS, and it also tells you some things you should not do
or say because they drive most people with fibromyalgia wild. (People who
do have fibromyalgia may enjoy reading Chapter 19, too, and sharing it with
their friends and family members who don’t have FMS.)

F
or Sandy, the horrible pain is what bothers her most about her
fibromyalgia. Sure, she has some other symptoms that bother her as
well, such as fatigue and chronic muscle stiffness, especially in the morning.
But only the severe pain counts, in her mind.
For Lisa, the pain is also terrible, but she thinks that if she weren’t so horri-
bly tired all the time, maybe the pain drugs that she takes would allow her to
actually accomplish something — anything. As it is, it’s like she’s trapped in
quicksand.
Andy, another person with fibromyalgia, says that he feels overwhelmed by
everything. The pain. The constant tiredness. The confusion. The frequent
headaches. Andy wants it all to go away — preferably right now.
In this chapter, I cover key symptoms of fibromyalgia, including — first and
foremost — the pain and stiffness that nearly everyone complains about. I
also cover the extreme fatigue that causes constant problems for most
people with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). In addition, I include information
on what some people with fibromyalgia call fibro fog, which is really a sort of
temporary mental confusion resulting in difficulty concentrating.

I also cover syndromes and diseases commonly associated with fibromyalgia,
such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, chronic headaches,
chronic heartburn, depression, and arthritic conditions. You may be inter-
ested to discover that some treatments for these individual ailments are simi-
lar to (or the same as) treatments recommended for fibromyalgia.
Describing Where It Hurts: 
Almost Everywhere!
Most people with fibromyalgia say that the widespread pain drives them the
most crazy. Sure, they don’t like fatigue or muscle aches, nor do they enjoy
fibro fog. These symptoms are common for many people with FMS. But they
may seem minor league compared to the hurting-all-over pain, which can
sometimes escalate from mild or moderate to severe pain.
Eva has had FMS for years, and says that if you want to understand how FMS
feels, imagine a giant truck ran over you — and backed up and ran over you
again.
Feeling the aches and body pains of 
your fibromyalgia — but being unable 
to show proof
You probably find it hard to explain to people where you hurt. You can get
pretty strange looks when you say that you hurt almost everywhere. Not just
in your back, legs, neck, or other sites of your body. All those places may
hurt, and maybe other places, too. Nor do you have visible damage to point
to. No broken bones, no gushing wounds, not one bruise to show someone,
“Here is where it hurts me the most. Look at this.”
Laboratory tests can’t diagnose fibromyalgia — at least, not yet. Tests can
only tell you that you don’t have other medical problems known to cause
pain. You shouldn’t, therefore, be surprised if doctors can’t find anything
except some tender points, where you wince when pressure is applied there.
(Read more about the tender points of fibromyalgia in Chapter 8.)
So you have no hard evidence that you can present for your pain. And yet
you continue to hurt and hurt and hurt and hurt.
22
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

As an FMS sufferer, you’re not alone in regard to a lack of specific laboratory
findings. People with chronic migraine headaches, tension headaches, and
back pain have recurrent pain, and often doctors find no specific abnormali-
ties. In fact, many chronic-pain conditions lack overt physical findings. But
remember, you don’t have to prove to anyone — including your doctor —
that you hurt. You know that you have pain, and that should be good enough
for your physician.
Focus on finding a knowledgeable doctor who can diagnose your illness. If
you have FMS, you’ll also have classic symptoms, such as chronic wide-
spread pain and tenderness as well as fatigue, insomnia, and distress. A
doctor who takes a thorough medical history, performs screening tests for
other possible diseases, and does a careful physical examination can diag-
nose most FMS sufferers. (See Chapter 7 for advice on finding a good
fibromyalgia doctor.)
Suffering from muscle stiffness — 
especially in the morning
Many people with fibromyalgia say that the severe muscle stiffness and achi-
ness is the worst in the morning. You may wake up and feel as though you’ve
already participated in a major marathon — or maybe as though gremlins
beat you all night long. The stiffness may diminish as you move about, but
usually it doesn’t go away completely. People with arthritis also often experi-
ence muscle stiffness, so maybe in the past, doctors told you that your prob-
lem was arthritis.
You may have both arthritis and fibromyalgia. Unfortunately, having
fibromyalgia doesn’t exempt you from other medical problems. If you suffer
from chronic stiffness, turn to Chapter 15, which includes some good, easy
stretching exercises to help you with this problem.
Tammy, whose fibromyalgia was diagnosed several years ago, feels that one
of the hardest parts is the severe morning stiffness. In fact, when she gets up
in the morning or rises after sitting for a long period, her husband calls her
contortions her “rigor-mortis walk” because her movements look so stiff.
(Tammy says that she doesn’t mind his teasing because he’s supportive and
understanding of the problems that she faces with fibromyalgia.)
Singling out a source of 
your pain: You can’t
When you try to analyze where all this pain is coming from — the master gen-
erator of your agony — you most likely can’t figure it out. Nor can you
23
Chapter 2: Recognizing Key Symptoms of Fibromyalgia

deduce why you’re experiencing it. However, you may have found out that
stress makes almost all your symptoms worse. Your doctor may often be puz-
zled by these questions, too. (Read about possible causes of fibromyalgia in
Chapter 3.)
Some experts believe that extreme exercise or injuries from a car accident or
a fall may induce FMS. But you probably haven’t been exercising like crazy
because you’ve felt too bad to exercise a lot (or at all). You probably haven’t
just fallen or had an accident or injury, either.
Chronically feeling your pain
Another key aspect of fibromyalgia is that the pain is chronic, which means
it’s sticking around. Sometimes, it’s better; sometimes, it’s worse. But it’s
almost always there in the background, seemingly waiting to ambush you.
Time for the big annual dinner at work! All of a sudden, your pain escalates to
excruciatingly high levels. As with many chronic illnesses, stress often aggra-
vates fibromyalgia. As a result, pain can flare up at the worst times.
Are you suffering from oligoanalgesia? This word refers to the undertreat-
ment, ineffectual treatment, or total nontreatment of pain — a problem that
many people with fibromyalgia relate to. Yet both nontreatment and inade-
quate treatment of pain can seriously weaken your immune system and
impair your quality of life. Turn to Chapter 4 for more information on pain
and its role in your life.
Migrating pain: The worst pain 
may move from place to place
Another truly maddening aspect of FMS is that the worst pain can be in your
lower back today, your neck tomorrow, and maybe in your upper back the
next day. Or maybe your whole spinal column is okay now, but you’re having
a serious problem with pain from irritable bowel syndrome or chronic
headaches — both common conditions for people with fibromyalgia.
Pam says that her fibromyalgia feels like a kind of radiating pain that pops up
like a poltergeist in new places all the time. She never knows when or where
it’ll hit her next. It’s the kind of surprise she’d prefer to live without, so Pam
is actively seeking treatment.
Fibromyalgia isn’t the only chronic medical syndrome. Many medical prob-
lems are chronic. High blood pressure is a chronic problem for many people;
diabetes is another. Many people suffer from chronic back pain. You’re not
alone in experiencing a chronic disease.
24
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Being Terribly Fatigued
Darla says that sometimes she orders her feet to move, but they just don’t
go, which is especially true when she gets up in the morning. This extreme
fatigue is common among people with fibromyalgia. Yet, despite such pro-
found fatigue, few patients with FMS get a satisfactory night’s sleep. Although
the pain is still the worst part for most people with fibromyalgia, the bone-
numbing exhaustion is also terribly distressing for many people, who say that
this kind of fatigue goes far beyond simple tiredness.
Feeling exhausted
If you actually were exercising vigorously, you could understand this extreme
pain and exhaustion. But if you’ve been in couch-potato mode, sitting or lying
down all day (because it hurts to move), you can feel really frustrated when
doing nothing seems to take all the energy you’ve got.
Your frustration may increase when you hear that you should be sure to exer-
cise. What? When you can barely drag your body out of bed or from the
chair? Is your doctor totally nuts? Well, no, actually exercise is good advice. I
tell you why in Chapter 15, and I recommend some basic exercises to try, too.
(Be sure to read it!)
25
Chapter 2: Recognizing Key Symptoms of Fibromyalgia
As if the other symptoms weren’t enough . . .
Some people with FMS suffer from an array of
other symptoms beyond pain, fatigue, sleep dif-
ficulties, brain fog, and so forth. Here are some
annoying, but more unusual, symptoms:
 Restless legs: People with this symptom
feel an achiness and irritability in their legs
(sometimes at night when lying in bed) that
makes them move about or shake their legs.
 Paresthesia: Also known as “pins and nee-
dles,” this symptom primarily affects the
legs, hands, or feet of fibromyalgia sufferers.
 Tinnitus: A high-pitched ringing in the 
ears is a problem that some people with
fibromyalgia experience.
Of course, these symptoms may be caused by
other medical problems, so if you have them, be
sure to let your doctor know.

Considering whether you have 
chronic fatigue syndrome
Some people who haven’t been diagnosed with FMS yet are so extremely
tired that they wonder if they really may have chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),
a medical problem characterized by extreme exhaustion. (Read Chapter 6 for
more information on CFS.) In general, if pain is the prevailing symptom and
other symptoms of fibromyalgia are also present, it’s likely to be fibromyalgia
rather than chronic fatigue syndrome.
But, of course, a physician must make this determination. Don’t try to diag-
nose yourself. And by the way, it’s also possible to have both CFS and
fibromyalgia. Hopefully, though, that’s not the case with you.
Facing Fibro Fog: Mental Malaise
Many people say that the mental confusion and forgetfulness, particularly the
attention and concentration difficulties, are what really bothers them. People
with fibromyalgia are bookkeepers, attorneys, doctors, and so on. All these
careers require mental alertness. But you can have the easiest job in the
world, and it still requires more mental acuity than you can muster up in the
middle of a fibro-fog attack — even if you’re a certified genius.
If you have a sense of humor, it can help you relax — at least a little. In fact,
you need a sense of humor with fibromyalgia. Linda was diagnosed with
fibromyalgia several years ago and says that a sense of humor is very impor-
tant for her. She recalls pouring cereal on a dinner plate, followed by the milk,
and then realizing: Oops! That wasn’t a bowl she was filling up. She finds that
laughing at the results of her fibro fog helps a lot.
Feeling “out of it”
You may feel like you’re one of those walking zombies that you see in late-
night movies. Feeling as though you’re a sleepwalker through life, rather than
an active participant in it, can be hard.
Avoid labeling yourself as stupid, crazy, or worthless. Do the best you can.
That’s all that anyone should expect. Still, dealing with it can be hard.
Judy says that her fibromyalgia developed about a year after she was treated for
Graves’ disease, a form of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland). She says
26
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

that she wants her brain back the way it was before. She’s tired of forgetting
words, names, and faces. Treatment may help Judy considerably. But it’s best
for most people with fibromyalgia to deal with things the way they are now,
instead of fixating on the way things were in the past.
Being frequently inattentive
You probably have a hard time paying attention to what’s going on around you
when you’re saddled with the mental malaise characteristic of fibromyalgia.
Sure, you’d love to be actively involved, but it’s just not possible now. It’s not
that you don’t care about your friends or that you don’t love your family mem-
bers. You do. You just can’t help being so inattentive on so many occasions.
Normally, you stride along, accomplishing your daily tasks at a regular pace. But
when you’re hit with fibro fog, it’s like slogging through knee-deep mental mire.
(Be sure to read Chapter 18 on how to help your friends, family members, and
others you care about understand fibromyalgia and what’s going on with you.)
Wondering about attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder
You may wonder whether your real problem could actually be attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a syndrome characterized by chronic
disorganization, distractibility, inattentiveness, and impulsivity. Sometimes
people with ADHD are also hyperactive, but adults with ADHD are far less
likely to be hyperactive than are children with the disorder. Of course, every-
one is disorganized, distractible, and so on — on some occasions — but for
the person with ADHD, these are constant problems.
If your primary problem is chronic pain all over, pain that doctors can’t
attribute to anything other than fibromyalgia, FMS is most likely the cause of
your problems with disorganization, distractibility, and the rest. (Of course,
as with other conditions, you could have both fibromyalgia and ADHD.)
Some researchers have found that adults with the primary problem of
untreated ADHD are more likely to have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue than
others, and when their ADHD is treated, the muscle pain and severe exhaus-
tion improve dramatically. Also, what these patients often thought was fibro
fog was actually the distractibility of ADHD. It often improves with treatment
for ADHD. If you think you may have ADHD, see a psychiatrist or psychologist
experienced with treating this disorder in adults.
27
Chapter 2: Recognizing Key Symptoms of Fibromyalgia

Coping with temporary confusion
Coping with your temporary mental confusion can be very difficult. After all,
how can you solve a problem when you’re unable to pay attention to the task
at hand or concentrate on it? Plus, stress can trigger or worsen your dis-
tractibility. The trick is to find remedies when you’re not confused that will
work (or at least, help) when you are confused.
You may want to try some tricks that help people with ADHD cope with con-
fusion, such as creating simple lists, always keeping your car keys in the
same place, and quickly checking yourself in the mirror before you leave
home. (Yes, your clothes are right side out and your hair is combed. Or they
aren’t, so you fix them.)
Weathering Your Reactions to Weather
Many people with fibromyalgia feel that they’re very weather-sensitive. When
a cold or warm front is coming on, before they hear it on the radio or see a
TV report about the impending storm, they feel pain intensifying in their
bodies. Major temperature changes may also cause flare-ups of fibromyalgia
symptoms. Cold and wet weather seems to bother weather-sensitive
fibromyalgia sufferers the most.
Some people study the phenomenon of weather changes and their impact:
It’s called biometeorology, or the study of how weather (changes in air pres-
sure, precipitation, temperature, wind, and so forth) can affect people’s
bodies.
People who have increased fibromyalgia pain with weather changes have
reported that the worst months for them are November and December, and
the best month is July. However, you shouldn’t count on July as being a no-
pain month, nor should you basically go into hibernation at the end of
October. In fact, you may notice no differences in those months at all,
because individual reactions to weather vary.
Some anecdotal reports indicate that women may be more weather-sensitive
than men are. Of course, how you feel really depends on your individual cir-
cumstances, the type of climate that you live in, and other factors. In general,
most people with fibromyalgia do better in milder climates. However, experts
say that if you’re a weather-sensitive person with fibromyalgia, relocating to a
warm, dry climate won’t automatically make you feel completely well. You
may feel better, but don’t assume that moving to Arizona will mean a cure for
you — it usually won’t.
28
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Dealing with Common Sleep Disorders
Difficulty with sleeping is extremely common for people with fibromyalgia. In
fact, if you don’t have this problem and you’ve been diagnosed with FMS,
you’re unusual — and you may not have fibromyalgia at all. (On the other
hand, maybe whatever you’re doing to combat your sleep disorder is work-
ing, and that’s good.)
Fibromyalgia pain often causes insomnia and other sleep disorders. In a vicious
cycle, the lack of sleep usually makes you feel worse, which in turn, makes it
even harder for you to sleep the next night. You can build up a serious sleep
deficit. Solutions, however, are available. If you suffer from sleep problems,
read Chapter 14 to find out more about how to improve your sleep cycles.
Experiencing Related Medical Problems
Many people with fibromyalgia also suffer from a variety of other pain-based
medical problems that affect the digestive system, the joints, the nerves, and
the mind, such as
 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
 Interstitial cystitis (IC)
 Osteoarthritis
 Rheumatoid arthritis
 Lupus
 Benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS)
 Chronic headaches
 Heartburn
Experts don’t know why these types of painful problems seem to go together,
but they have plenty of theories to explain it. One theory is that the system
that controls pain — whether it’s a neurochemical (brain chemical), hormone,
or something else — has gone awry. As a result, the afflicted person can
suffer from a variety of painful conditions. (Read more about possible causes
of fibromyalgia in Chapter 3.)
If you have more than one illness, you may receive medications for each med-
ical problem. The situation can be further complicated when you see more
than one doctor, particularly if you make the bad mistake of not telling each
doctor about every medication you take, including all vitamins and supple-
ments, as well as all prescribed drugs. Each drug has the potential to change
29
Chapter 2: Recognizing Key Symptoms of Fibromyalgia

the effect of every other drug. It may boost or weaken the effects of other
medications or change their effects in some other way. Some drug interactions
can be dangerous.
Dealing with irritable bowel syndrome
Having the pain, achiness, and mental confusion that can accompany
fibromyalgia is bad enough. But many people with FMS also suffer from irrita-
ble bowel syndrome (IBS), a colonic condition that, very simply put, causes
the person to feel bloated and alternate between having constipation and
diarrhea. (Another name for IBS is spastic colon.)
Many people with IBS either can’t go at all or are constantly running for the
bathroom. Some people with IBS have only chronic constipation or only
chronic diarrhea. Studies indicate that about 15 percent of adults in the
United States have symptoms of IBS, and the disease is about three times
more prominent among women.
As with fibromyalgia, experts disagree on what actually causes IBS, although
most concur that stress makes it worse. Most experts also agree that certain
types of foods can aggravate IBS. Interestingly, some of the same foods that
can cause a flare-up of fibromyalgia can also worsen IBS, such as citrus fruits,
chocolate, and alcohol, to name the leading culprits.
Diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome
Your primary-care doctor can usually diagnose and treat IBS, although she
may want to refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive dis-
eases. Based on your physical examination and a review of your medical his-
tory, the gastroenterologist may perform a colonoscopy, which is an internal
exam of your colon done while you’re under mild sedation. This procedure is
especially likely to be done if you’re over age 50 or at risk for developing col-
orectal cancer. When the doctor examines your colon from the inside with a
special scope, he’ll see any indications of disease.
Treating irritable bowel syndrome
How is IBS treated? The doctor will usually urge you to increase your intake of
vegetables and cut back on (or eliminate) alcohol and chocolate. Medication
can help, and sometimes the same drugs that help a person with fibromyalgia
can also alleviate some IBS symptoms. For example, a low dose of an antide-
pressant such as Elavil (generic name: amitriptyline) may ease IBS symptoms
as well as FMS symptoms. Some medications used specifically to treat IBS
symptoms have been withdrawn from the market because of side effects, for
example, Zelnorm (generic name: tegaserod maleate) for constipation and
Lotronex (generic name: alosetron hydrochloride) for diarrhea.

Dean, MD, ND, and L. Christine Wheeler, MA (Wiley).
Coping with interstitial cystitis
Some people with fibromyalgia suffer from a painful bladder condition called
interstitial cystitis (IC). This chronic and sometimes severe condition makes
people with it feel like they must urinate constantly. The person feels this
way even after she just went to the bathroom. The condition may feel like a
bladder infection, but no bacteria are found when the urine is cultured.
Often, the bladder aches painfully. Many people with IC have been treated
with repeated courses of antibiotics because doctors assumed that they
must have had bladder infections, despite a negative culture, because they
were in such pain. Yet unnecessary antibiotics can aggravate the painful blad-
der even further.
Experts don’t know what causes IC, but it may be a reaction to a previous infec-
tion, or could have an autoimmune basis — meaning that the immune system
attacks its own tissue. Most IC sufferers are women, but men can have IC, too.
Diagnosing interstitial cystitis
Because IC is rare, most primary-care physicians find it difficult to diagnose.
Generally, urologists (physicians specializing in diseases of the urinary tract)
diagnose IC.
In the case of most people who think they may have (or do have) a bladder
infection, many doctors recommend drinking copious quantities of cranberry
juice to help stave it off. Don’t do this if you have IC! Your bladder is unusu-
ally sensitive, and the high acidity of cranberry juice will accelerate spasms
and pain. Instead, ask your doctor for another remedy. And be sure to drink
plenty of water.
Treating interstitial cystitis
Chronic cases of IC can be treated with medications instilled directly into the
bladder through a catheter. Patients can also take certain oral medicines to
calm bladder spasms.
As with IBS, some of the same medications that help other symptoms of
fibromyalgia may help the person with IC. For example, Elavil (generic name:
amitriptyline) may help with pain from IC.
Doctors also often recommend dietary changes. As with IBS and other condi-
tions commonly experienced by patients with FMS, doctors often advise IC
patients to avoid citrus fruits, chocolate, and alcohol.

Chapter 2: Recognizing Key Symptoms of Fibromyalgia

Aching with arthritis
Joint inflammations can be very painful, worsening the already-existing prob-
lem of fibromyalgia. Sometimes people who have fibromyalgia are diagnosed
with arthritis instead. They may be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and
other medications that often work well for people with arthritis but may do
little or nothing for people who have FMS.
Diagnosing arthritis
Arthritis isn’t a tough call for most doctors to diagnose, although some rarer
forms, such as lupus, can be tricky. Rheumatologists, or doctors who special-
ize in treating arthritis and other diseases of the joints, bones, and muscles,
are the best experts to diagnose all forms of arthritis.
In general, the diagnosis of arthritis is based on the doctor’s findings during
the physical examination combined with the results from X-ray and labora-
tory tests that the doctor ordered. (Read Chapter 8 for more information on
the physical examination and diagnosis of fibromyalgia.) However, many dif-
ferent types of arthritis exist, and the necessary tests may vary depending on
what type your doctor believes that you may have.
Osteoarthritis
The most common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis, which causes the pro-
gressive deterioration of the cartilage and joints of your body. It often comes
with aging, although you can be in your 30s or younger when osteoarthritis
first becomes a problem. Very simply, osteoarthritis causes pain and deterio-
ration of your joints. It can often be detected by simple X-rays. The doctor
will usually order an X-ray of the joints that bother you the most — whether
your knees, back, or another part of your skeletal system.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis, much less common than osteoarthritis, is another form
of arthritis. It is triggered when the body’s immune system turns on you. This
disease may be detected with several special blood tests that can identify
factors found in rheumatoid arthritis. If these factors are not found, you may
not have this illness.
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis risk developing joint erosions, joint
destruction, and severe physical deformities and disability, in addition to the
inflammation of other organs. They may be treated with anti-inflammatory
medications and ice. They are often also treated with one or more disease-
modifying drugs specific to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, such as
Rheumtrex (generic name: Methotexate), Enbrel (generic name: etanercept),
Humira (generic name: adalinumab), or Remicade (generic name: inflixamab).
32
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Lupus
Lupus is a rare autoimmune arthritis disorder that also attacks the joints and
other tissues including the kidneys. It is often characterized by a facial rash
in the shape of a butterfly, as well as by pain that migrates from one area to
another.
Benign joint hypermobility syndrome
Benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) is a condition that enables a
person to hyperextend joints, as with people who are double-jointed. This
may sound like an advantage, but it often causes joint pain, as well as wide-
spread pain. BJHS may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications, as well
as physical therapy. Strength training may be used as well.
People with BJHS may have some joints that are hypermobile while others
are below-normal. Interestingly, BJHS is often associated with poor balance
and autonomic nervous system abnormalities, similar to people with
fibromyalgia.
Treating arthritis
How your arthritis is treated depends on what type of arthritis you have, how
severe it is, how long you’ve had it, and many other factors. Many forms of
arthritis are treated with over-the-counter or prescribed medications, such as
anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as with heating or icing the painful area or
sometimes massage. (Flip to Chapter 11 for more information on hands-on
therapies, such as icing and heating your pain problems.)
The doctor may also prescribe a muscle relaxant, if your muscles appear to
be spasming around the damaged joint. Painkillers are frequently prescribed,
ranging from over-the-counter ibuprofen to strong narcotics. What the doctor
recommends depends on the patient and the situation.
Suffering from frequent headaches
Do you suffer from FMS as well as regular bouts with severe headaches? If so,
you’re certainly not alone. No one knows how many people with fibromyalgia
suffer from periodic migraines or tension headaches, but doctors know that
they happen a lot. The underlying problem could be that whatever in the
body that controls pain has gone wrong. Or it could be that the body is
overly sensitive to pain. It may even be both.
Diagnosing headaches
A migraine is a special kind of headache that can be extremely severe and is
often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain is usually excruciating;
33
Chapter 2: Recognizing Key Symptoms of Fibromyalgia

people often describe it as “blinding.” People with migraines often complain
that light and sounds bother them, and they generally want to lie down in a
dark place alone and in the same position as long as possible (or until their
medication kicks in). (For more on migraines, check out Migraines For
Dummies, by Diane Stafford and Jennifer Shoquist, MD [Wiley].)
A tension headache is another type of headache. It isn’t necessarily caused by
stress or tension, although it can be. Tension headaches stem from tightened
muscles, often in the neck. Virtually everyone has had a tension headache at
some point. When tension headaches (or any type of headaches) become
chronic, though, you need to see your doctor to get a handle on the why of
this frequency and to rule out any serious underlying problems.
If your headaches constantly occur and are severe, your doctor may order a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain, a special test to rule
out a brain tumor or other dangerous condition.
Treating your headache problem
If you have headaches that happen for no apparent reason (much like your
fibromyalgia), your doctor will probably treat you with painkilling medica-
tions. Drugs such as Elavil (generic name: amitriptyline) — as used with IBS,
interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia — are often prescribed to keep chronic
headaches under control or (even better) to prevent them from happening in
the first place.
Generally, doctors also recommend that you avoid acidic fruits, chocolate,
and alcohol. (I’m not making this up. Are you starting to see a pattern here?)
In addition, although caffeine may be used in some drugs to treat severe
headaches, you’ll generally be discouraged from heavy consumption of caf-
feinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and sodas.
Some research indicates that migraine headaches may be caused by a minor
deficiency of magnesium, and in such cases, supplemental magnesium may
help. Of course, before you consider adding magnesium to your diet, check
with your doctor. Also realize that magnesium may stimulate your colon, so if
you already have IBS and suffer from chronic diarrhea, magnesium may not
be the right answer for you.
Hurting with heartburn
Many people who have fibromyalgia also suffer from chronic heartburn. They
may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which food
comes partly up the esophagus, which connects to your stomach, instead of
going down where it’s supposed to go. The condition can be extremely irritat-
ing to the esophagus. Although the stomach has a protective layer of
mucous, the esophagus has no such protection. Chronic heartburn can wear
down the esophagus and may create a precancerous condition.
34
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease
Most primary-care doctors can easily diagnose GERD. If a person appears to
have symptoms of chronic heartburn — belching, upset stomach, food that
she tastes repeatedly a long time after she ate it, because it backs up (other-
wise known as repeating) — the doctor may prescribe acid-blocking medica-
tions. If patients who take these medications feel better, they probably had
heartburn.
Sometimes doctors refer patients with heartburn symptoms to gastroenterol-
ogists. The gastroenterologist may perform an endoscopy, a procedure in
which the doctor looks into the esophagus and stomach while the patient is
mildly sedated. The endoscopy shows if there’s any serious problem. It can
also confirm if GERD is present.
According to the book How to Stop Heartburn: Simple Ways to Heal Heartburn
and Acid Reflux, by Anil Minocha, MD, and Christine Adamec (Wiley), strong
painkillers, such as Percocet or Vicodin, can cause or worsen your GERD. So
if you’re finding that your painkiller or other medication for fibromyalgia
seems to worsen your heartburn, let your doctor know so that you can be
switched to another type of medication.
Treating gastroesophageal reflux disease
GERD is usually treated with acid-blocking medications. People with GERD
are also usually given dietary recommendations, such as no acidic fruit,
chocolate, or alcohol.
Many people with GERD also have problems with insomnia, as do people with
FMS. A low dose of a sedating antidepressant may help resolve that problem,
as may a prescribed sleep remedy. (Read more about sleep in Chapter 14.) In
the case of GERD, however, this advice is accompanied with other recommen-
dations, such as to raise the head of the bed and avoid late-night eating.
Exercising and weight loss are also common recommendations given to
people with chronic heartburn.
Dealing with depression
If you have fibromyalgia, you’re at increased risk for depression. Depression
is a chronic and severely low mood state, in which a person feels chronically
sad and has feelings of poor self-worth, appetite and sleep disturbances, and
a loss of enjoyment in activities that used to be pleasurable. At worst, the
depressed person considers or acts on suicidal thoughts. At best, the person
feels sad and distressed. Thankfully, depression is highly treatable.
Diagnosing depression
Many primary-care physicians recognize and treat depression, although they
may refer the patient to a psychiatrist, a specialist in treating emotional disorders.
35
Chapter 2: Recognizing Key Symptoms of Fibromyalgia

One problem that some people with fibromyalgia face is that doctors may see
depression as the entire problem rather than one piece of the fibromyalgia
symptoms puzzle. Thus, if the depression is treated, the mood disorder may
lift, but the pain, fatigue, and other symptoms of the fibromyalgia may con-
tinue on, unabated and unrelenting. If you feel as though you’re being shut-
tled off to a shrink when you urgently need help for your pain, maybe you’re
right. Speak up for yourself.
Treating depression with medication or therapy
Depressive disorders are usually treated with antidepressants and therapy.
Doctors have many different types of antidepressant medications to choose
from. If a drug from one category doesn’t work, another medication may be
effective.
The older and less expensive antidepressant drugs such as Elavil (generic
name: amitriptyline) may be useful in treating pain syndromes; consequently,
you may get the impact of “two for the price of one” if you take such a drug.
However, newer drugs such as Cymbalta (generic name: duloxetine) have
proven to be very useful as well.
Depression is often treated effectively by therapists using cognitive-
behavioral therapy (CBT), sometimes known as “talk therapy.” With this ther-
apy, the therapist teaches the person to consider how he’s thinking about his
problems. (That’s the “cognitive” part.) The therapist shows patients how to
challenge erroneous assumptions — the “behavioral” part of CBT.
The CBT therapist can help you identify ill-serving assumptions about your-
self (which you may never have challenged or even noticed before), replacing
them with better ones. Such as replacing negative thoughts with something
like: “I do not deserve to have this medical problem, and I can feel better! And
I really deserve to be well!”
Then you can work toward finding and implementing effective ways to help
you work toward your own much-deserved wellness. I offer many ideas in
this book for you to try in order to reach that important goal!

L
isa was in a very bad car crash; the air bag was released so explosively
that powder from the air bag flew under her contact lenses and tem-
porarily damaged her eyes. She recovered from the accident — or thought
she did — but then Lisa began suffering from severe and widespread pain
and fatigue. Her symptoms continued to baffle her doctors for several years
before one of them finally diagnosed her with fibromyalgia.
Jamie, on the other hand, has had no accidental injuries, and she really can’t
trace the onset of her fibromyalgia. In fact, she says that she doesn’t know when
she did not have the symptoms of fibromyalgia. As long as she can remember,
she’s suffered from pain, fatigue, and fibro fog (memory problems and confusion
associated with fibromyalgia). Jamie has forgotten exactly how many doctors
she may have seen before her condition was finally diagnosed. She does know
that her sister, mother, and aunt all have similar symptoms, and she’s pressed
them to ask their doctors if they could have fibromyalgia, too. Jamie believes
that fibromyalgia has a genetic basis because it seems to run in her family.
Both Lisa and Jamie have fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), although the proba-
ble causes for each woman’s current condition are apparently different. A
trauma to the body can sometimes cause a long-term effect that translates
into fibromyalgia, as in Lisa’s case. And some people may have a genetic pre-
disposition to developing fibromyalgia, as Jamie believes. Her assumption
that her family members have FMS may not be correct, but she is right in
actively urging them to obtain the medical help that they need.

38
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 
Research has shown that fibromyalgia can be triggered by injuries (especially
neck injuries), infections, and traumatic events. So I begin this chapter dis-
cussing these causes, moving afterward to more speculative causes for
fibromyalgia, such as environmental causes, Gulf War syndrome, chemical
imbalances, immune problems, and other causes. However, I can’t tell you
which single cause is the “right” one for all people. In fact, fibromyalgia prob-
ably doesn’t have one single cause; it may instead have multiple causes.
I can tell you that research on fibromyalgia and its causes is actively ongoing
and will, I hope, bring us the needed knowledge to uncover the underlying
causes of this syndrome. Keep in mind that discovery is an ongoing process.
Science continues to march forward, sometimes lurching sideways, to make
unexpected new findings that help us.
From injuries and other forms of physical trauma to infections, environmen-
tal causes, and severe stress causing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
to the effects of genetics, in this chapter I discuss the primary causes for why
some people develop fibromyalgia.
Down But Not Out: Physical Trauma
A physical trauma may be severe enough for some people to ultimately
develop FMS. In addition to an accidental injury, some researchers have
argued that the onset of fibromyalgia can be attributed to physical or sexual
abuse that occurred in childhood or in adulthood. Unfortunately, some
people are abused both in childhood and in adulthood, increasing their risk
for a variety of health problems.
In these cases of fibromyalgia, the afflicted people were basically healthy
before the traumatic injuries occurred, and they had no or few symptoms of
fibromyalgia. However, at some point after the accidental injury or physical
or sexual abuse, fibromyalgia moved in and seemed to make a permanent
home for itself in their bodies.
Although current studies seem to indicate a relationship of FMS with a previ-
ous trauma, future large, prospective studies need to be conducted to defini-
tively prove this relationship.
Looking at types of trauma that 
may cause fibromyalgia
What kinds of physical trauma may trigger fibromyalgia? The syndrome can
result from an injury due to a car crash, or it may stem from a serious acci-
dental injury that happened at work. Even a major slip and fall causing an

injury can be enough to produce the symptoms of fibromyalgia in some
people. For other individuals, a medical crisis or surgery may trigger the
development of FMS. A medical crisis is something like a severe infection,
surgery, or diabetic crisis.
No one knows how often severe traumas actually lead to the development of
fibromyalgia, but probably no more than half (at most) of all cases of FMS
stem from physical trauma.
Severe accidental injuries
Debbie was in a car crash, and although she didn’t break any bones, she had
a great deal of soft-tissue damage. She says that she was covered from head
to toe with bruises and people were shocked at the very sight of her. After
the accident, Debbie began experiencing severe headaches and extreme over-
all pain. She had been a successful computer programmer, but ultimately she
had to give up her much-loved programming career. Debbie says that she
couldn’t write programs anymore, and she couldn’t even read or comprehend
what was on the computer screen most of the time, nor could she make any
sense of written instructions off the screen. She struggled — and mostly
failed — to stay on task because of so much difficulty with reading instruc-
tions and remembering what she was doing. It wasn’t until Debbie’s doctor
finally diagnosed her FMS that she began to start picking up the pieces of her
life again.
Rebecca, another person whose FMS apparently stemmed from a physical
trauma, began experiencing fibromyalgia pain and symptoms after a very bad
fall. She slipped and fell, breaking her leg, heel, and toes. In addition to the
FMS symptoms, she developed very severe pain in her knee, which her doc-
tors diagnosed as arthritis. Following the advice of her doctors, Rebecca had
a knee reconstruction. Her knee felt better after the surgery, but her overall
body pain then began in earnest. Rebecca says that she had enormous trou-
ble sleeping, and, at best, she was clocking three or four hours of sleep per
night. She also had trouble walking around. Sometimes these difficulties
became extreme, and Rebecca says that she had to go to the hospital emer-
gency room 12 times in one year. Rebecca was finally diagnosed with
fibromyalgia by a doctor who actually listened to her description of her
symptoms, performed a thorough physical examination, ordered laboratory
tests to rule out other illnesses, and then correctly deduced that the problem
was fibromyalgia (probably caused by the fall) and began to treat it.
Injuries from car crashes or other accidents can trigger fibromyalgia in some
people. You can’t help it if you were in a car crash or you fell down, but you
can deal with the aftermath of fibromyalgia symptoms, when they occur.
Physical or sexual abuse
Physical or sexual abuse is another type of trauma that may lead to
fibromyalgia. Some people were subjected to physical or sexual abuse during
their childhood, while others are abused in adulthood. Jeanne calls herself an
39
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia

“incest survivor” because a family member sexually abused her when she
was a little girl. Jeanne says that she also suffered from extreme stress that
stemmed from the abuse, and she later developed fibromyalgia as well.
In another case, Sara, who was physically abused by her husband, says that
various doctors suspected that her fibromyalgia was triggered by a near-
death beating that she suffered, during which she also suffered a serious
head injury and neck trauma.
Some people who were abused as children continue to be abused as adults
by their spouses or other individuals. All that physical battering can eventu-
ally take its painful toll on the human body, and sometimes the “price” is
fibromyalgia.
Because of these associations, your doctor may ask you probing questions
pertaining to sensitive areas of your personal life, including the existence of
any current or past abusive relationships, sexual abuse, or physical trauma.
Try not to be offended — your doctor is just trying to understand your clini-
cal situation more clearly.
Being treated and getting counseling for factors such as domestic violence 
or childhood abuse may be as important in your therapy as any medicinal
treatments.
Extreme life-threatening illness
Tammy says that she was fine until, for some reason, she developed a serious
brain aneurysm that burst and required emergency surgery. Fortunately, the
brain surgery was successful — or so she thought. But shortly afterward,
Tammy began experiencing severe fatigue, muscle aches, a hard knot at the
top of her left shoulder, and other symptoms — all of which were later diag-
nosed as fibromyalgia. Since then, she has wondered whether the brain
aneurysm may somehow have triggered her fibromyalgia.
Tammy’s illness is an example of how physical trauma to the body, including
from an extremely severe medical condition, can be a shock that precipitates
the development of fibromyalgia. Long after the cause of the illness has
passed, as with Tammy’s brain aneurysm, the effects of the trauma still
remain and must be dealt with.
Injuring yourself on the job
Could your symptoms stem from a work injury? A repetitive strain injury (an
injury that stems from repeated motions, such as from work on an assembly
line) may trigger the development of fibromyalgia. (The most commonly
known repetitive strain injury is carpal tunnel syndrome, which is damage to a
nerve in the hand that results from repeated motions.) An accidental injury
at work may also cause fibromyalgia.
40
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

If you think that your fibromyalgia may stem from an injury that occurred
while you were at work or as a result of the work that you perform, you may
be eligible for worker’s compensation. In a precedent-setting 1999 Illinois case
(Waldorf Corporation v. Industrial Commission), a worker whose job was to
stack cartons in repetitive motions was diagnosed by a rheumatologist with
fibromyalgia, and she sought worker’s compensation. She won at the lower
level, but the case was appealed by her employer. The lower court’s ruling
was later upheld. (Read more about work and fibromyalgia in Chapter 17.)
Other traumas
Even a very difficult pregnancy may trigger fibromyalgia in some susceptible
people. Rose says that she was always a sickly child with FMS-like problems,
but her really major symptoms didn’t develop until after she became preg-
nant. She didn’t get better after her child was born; instead, she became
increasingly ill. Finally, and to her great dismay, Rose became completely
bedridden with fibromyalgia when her daughter was about 6 years old.
41
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia
Post-traumatic stress disorder and fibromyalgia
Unusual stress and traumas may ultimately trig-
ger fibromyalgia. This reaction is known as
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The body
and mind apparently go into a hyper-aroused
state, and the individual may suffer from
extreme anxiety that continues long after the
distressing incident occurred. People who
suffer from PTSD can develop physical symp-
toms that lead to fibromyalgia either soon after
the incident or after six months or more.
PTSD may be caused by such horrors as wit-
nessing the violent death of another person,
experiencing rape or severe physical abuse, or
being threatened with death. Soldiers who have
served in combat, such as in Afghanistan and
Iraq, have an increased risk for PTSD. Not sur-
prisingly, PTSD is the most common disability
associated with military service. Other causes
of PTSD are torture, natural disasters, severe
car crashes, or being told that you have a life-
threatening illness. The person who suffers
from PTSD frequently reexperiences the dis-
tressing event in his mind, including the anguish
and pain that he felt when it actually happened.
He tends to actively avoid anything that may
remind him of the terrifying incident, including
the people or places associated with it. PTSD
can affect the person’s performance at work as
well as his social functioning.
PTSD has some basic symptoms, according to
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, DSM-IV-TR (a book used by mental
health professionals), published by the
American Psychiatric Association. When a
person has PTSD, the following symptoms
become present and were not there before the
traumatic incident:
 Sleep disorders, such as trouble falling
asleep or frequent awakenings
 Angry or irritable outbursts
 Problems with concentration
 Hypervigilance (The individual is always on
the watch for danger to appear on the hori-
zon and has an extreme startle response.
Someone touches him unexpectedly, and
he jerks far more violently than normal.)

Keep in mind that Rose’s case is a severe one. Most people don’t become this
disabled from fibromyalgia.
Investigating how physical trauma 
can trigger fibromyalgia
No one knows for sure how physical trauma or abuse can trigger fibromyal-
gia. But what may happen is that the body’s stress response is shocked into a
sort of hyperdrive. The stress response system may rush to help the body
resist the trauma by mobilizing hormones (chemicals created by the body,
such as cortisol and adrenalin) as well as neurochemicals (chemicals created
by the brain, such as serotonin or noradrenalin) and other body chemicals.
The body may hyper-react to the extent that, when the incident is all over,
the biochemical reactions still continue on.
For example, imagine your body as a sort of living house. Intruders break into
the house and attack it. They smash the windows and slash the carpet. They
throw paint on the walls. If a house were alive, it would try to repair itself
after the attack ended and the intruders were gone. It would also be vigilant.
If the house could somehow give itself burglar alarms and a security system,
it would do so.
Imagine if the live “house” decided to really protect itself from any future
attacks, by surrounding itself with razor wire, armed guards on alert with
machine guns, and killer dogs. This protection would be an overreaction, just
as sometimes after a trauma, people’s bodies go into a hypersensitive and
overreactive mode, too.
Catching Fibromyalgia
Some experts have hypothesized that fibromyalgia may result from a bacter-
ial or viral infection, which somehow triggers the FMS symptoms. In some
cases, the infection may cause the immune system to go into hyperdrive.
Research has borne out that infections apparently can trigger the develop-
ment of fibromyalgia in some people.
In a study reported in a 2001 issue of the Journal of Rheumatology, Danish
researchers compared the presence of antibodies (chemicals the body cre-
ated to kill invading bacteria or viruses) to enterovirus (a common viral infec-
tion) in 19 people with an acute onset of fibromyalgia to 20 subjects with a
slow onset of FMS. They found that half the people with a sudden onset of
FMS tested positive for the antibodies, but only 15 percent of the subjects
42
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

with a slow onset of fibromyalgia had the antibodies in their systems. Based
on these results, the researchers concluded that some patients with
fibromyalgia may have different immune responses. Although this theory
may sound far fetched, it’s certainly possible.
Some preliminary pharmaceutical research with interferon (a human immunity-
boosting chemical) has demonstrated that some people with FMS respond well
to the drug, indicating that an immune-system problem may be at work in at
least a portion of the people who have fibromyalgia. However, further research
is indicated before interferon can be used to treat fibromyalgia.
Interestingly, some people (mostly women) have an immune system that
apparently becomes hyperactive, turning on itself. This is called an autoim-
mune reaction, and it may be a cause of fibromyalgia. This may explain why a
large number of patients with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus ery-
thematosus (SLE) also have fibromyalgia. Conversely, other people may have
lethargic immune systems that are basically run down. Both extreme paths
may ultimately lead to fibromyalgia.
From a viral infection
Carla says that a virus may have triggered her fibromyalgia. She was very
healthy until she came down with a severe mosquito-borne virus that she
contracted in Australia. At the same time, her marriage also failed, and she
faced extreme stress from that breakup. The physical and emotional factors,
together with the damage to her body caused by the infection, may have
thrown Carla’s entire body into a turmoil, or so her doctors hypothesized.
In another case, Janet’s fibromyalgia symptoms began several months after
she’d recovered from a bout with mononucleosis, which may have triggered
her FMS.
For both Carla and Janet, an infection appears to have played a role in the
development of their FMS. Thus, indirectly, their fibromyalgia was “catching.”
From an autoimmune reaction
An FMS sufferer may have had an actual infection to the body, but the
person’s body hyper-reacted to the bacterial or viral invader by creating an
excessive response of the immune system, generating high levels of antibod-
ies. Those high levels of antibodies may have continued to act well after they
were still needed, leading to the damaging condition known as fibromyalgia.
43
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia

This theory makes particular sense, especially when considering that many
people with an already-diagnosed autoimmune disease, such as lupus, may
also suffer from a form of fibromyalgia. Therefore, all people being diagnosed
with fibromyalgia should have an evaluation to make sure that they don’t have
a recognized autoimmune disorder that’s precipitating their FMS symptoms.
From hepatitis B or hepatitis C
Fibromyalgia may be triggered by an infection with hepatitis B (a viral infec-
tion transmitted by body fluids that attacks the liver) or by hepatitis C (a less
common bloodborne infection that also attacks the liver). According to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 5,494 reported
active cases of hepatitis B in the United States in 2005, compared to 671 cases
of hepatitis C.
A study of the frequency of fibromyalgia among carriers of hepatitis B,
reported in a 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology, suggested
that chronic hepatitis B apparently increased the risk for the incidence of
fibromyalgia. Among 50 hepatitis B carriers, 26 percent met the criteria for
FMS, compared to 4 percent among the control group of subjects who didn’t
have hepatitis B. The patients with hepatitis B also had a much greater level
of fatigue (40 percent) compared to the control group (12 percent) and sleep
disorders (36 percent in the FMS group versus 8 percent in the control
group). Diffuse musculoskeletal pain was present in 48 percent of the hepati-
tis B carriers, compared to 6 percent of the patients in the control group who
didn’t have hepatitis B. Other clinical characteristics that were sharply
higher in the hepatitis B subjects were morning stiffness, headache, anxiety,
menstrual-cycle disorder, and irritable bowel syndrome. The researchers did
not know if the association between hepatitis B and fibromyalgia was directly
due to the viral infection, altered liver function, or other causes.
Because many schoolchildren in the United States are now immunized
against hepatitis B, this may help to decrease the incidence of fibromyalgia in
the future.
Hepatitis C is also linked to FMS. In a study reported in a 2003 issue of
Rheumatology International, the researchers found that 18 hepatitis C patients
(19 percent of their patients) also had fibromyalgia. Hepatitis C is mainly
transmitted through blood, while hepatitis B can be contracted through body
fluids or intimate physical contact. As a result of their study, the researchers
recommended that physicians who suspect that their patients may have
fibromyalgia should rule out hepatitis C as a possible cause of the medical
problem. If hepatitis C is found, the disease (hepatitis C) can be treated with
the appropriate medications (such as interferon and ribavirin, an antiviral
drug) as well as with other recommendations that the physician may have.
44
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

This evidence doesn’t mean that everyone or even most people with
fibromyalgia have hepatitis B or C. Instead, it means that hepatitis may cause
fibromyalgia-like symptoms, and, thus, hepatitis may need to be considered
as the cause of these symptoms. This need for testing is particularly true if
the individual experienced a blood transfusion before 1990. (After 1990, test-
ing to screen for hepatitis C was developed.) Testing is also necessary if the
individual has injected illegal drugs, because hepatitis C is transmitted
through the blood.
From other infections
Some experts say that some patients with fibromyalgia may have been previ-
ously infected with viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (a common virus
that causes infectious mononucleosis), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
parvovirus, or Lyme disease (a tick-borne illness that was originally discov-
ered in Lyme, Connecticut). In the case of Lyme disease patients who develop
FMS, their fibromyalgia symptoms typically don’t improve with the normal
antibiotic regimen that’s prescribed for Lyme disease.
Regarding Gulf War Syndrome
Unexplained musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep problems have been
observed after every military conflict as far back as the Civil War. To date,
researchers haven’t been able to identify any specific environmental agent as
the cause or the trigger of the particular symptoms experienced by the veter-
ans. The one thing they do all have in common is the stress that occurs
during war times. It is likely that this stress is responsible for their medical
problems.
After the Gulf War in 1991, similar to many other military campaigns through-
out history, as many as half of the military people who had served in the
Persian Gulf reported suffering from symptoms of muscle pain, headaches,
difficulty with memory, and fatigue. Among their military compatriots who
did not serve in the Gulf War region during the same time frame, only about
15 percent reported similar complaints. In retrospect, many of the veterans’
complaints, also generically known as Gulf War syndrome, may have been
consistent with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. However, despite intensive
research, no one could find any specific toxins, like nerve gas, that would
explain the Gulf veterans’ symptoms.
45
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia

Some researchers have speculated that the military people who served in the
Gulf during the war may have contracted a viral or bacterial infection that
could have led to their symptoms, perhaps one that was further aggravated
by the heightened stress of undergoing warfare in another country. Others
think that the severe stress of a combat situation alone could have been suffi-
cient to induce the medical problems that the veterans suffered from.
Soldiers in combat have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), which itself increases the risk for the development of
fibromyalgia and other medical problems.
In one study of Gulf War veterans (104 men and 21 women) who complained
of a variety of symptoms, the researchers at Oregon Health Sciences
University in Portland, Oregon, found that 27 percent of the veterans met the
diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome and 14 percent met the diag-
nostic criteria for fibromyalgia.
In another study published in 2005 in the Annals of Internal Medicine,
researchers compared the health of 1,061 individuals deployed to the Persian
Gulf in 1991 to nondeployed people in the military after ten years. The goal
was to determine if there were any long-term effects in deployed veterans
versus nondeployed veterans. Although the risk for fibromyalgia was low, the
researchers found that veterans who had been deployed to the Gulf were
nearly twice as likely to have fibromyalgia (2 percent) than the nondeployed
veterans (1.2 percent). They also found that the deployed veterans had an
increased risk for chronic fatigue syndrome, skin rashes, and dyspepsia
(chronic stomach upset).
What about veterans who have been deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq in the
21st century? It’s too soon to tell, but it seems likely that at least some of
these veterans will develop fibromyalgia, for many of the same reasons as
seen with veterans of the Gulf War and other wars.
46
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 
Female veterans and PTSD
A survey of 1,259 female veterans who received
care at a veterans’ facility in Puget Sound,
Washington, was reported in Archives of
Internal Medicine in 2004. The researchers
found that 21 percent of the women (266
women) were positive for PTSD. The women
with PTSD were significantly more likely to have
fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic
pelvic pain, premenstrual syndrome, obesity,
and other health problems than were the female
veterans without PTSD. For example, of the
female veterans with PTSD, 19.2 percent had
fibromyalgia, compared to 8 percent of the
women veterans without PTSD.
Clearly, PTSD is a risk factor for fibromyalgia.

Homing in on hormonal changes 
in fibromyalgia
Researchers have found that military veterans with fibromyalgia have low
levels of growth hormone, a hormone that works to repair muscle tissue.
Some civilians diagnosed with fibromyalgia have been found to have similarly
low levels of this same hormone.
Researchers say that stressful conditions can inhibit the production of growth
hormones. (It’s not only children who produce growth hormone. All through
your life, some levels of growth hormone are produced by the body.) So, per-
haps the military veterans who were in a state of heightened stress under war
conditions produced less growth hormone, which then led to the development
of fibromyalgia. This theory remains unproven, but it’s an intriguing possible
explanation for the higher-than-normal incidence of chronic pain and fatigue
among the military veterans who have served in the Gulf War.
Helping Gulf War veterans
No one may be able to explain why veterans return from war with symptoms
of chronic illnesses, but that doesn’t mean that these veterans can’t get help.
Veterans who served in the Gulf and who have since been diagnosed with
chronic illnesses — such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS), or fibromyalgia — may be eligible, and should apply, for
financial benefits that are available through the Veterans Administration (VA).
Congress passed a law in 1994 to cover military veterans with symptoms of
medical problems, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, but
many veterans were denied benefits. In January 2002, a law was passed to
broaden the coverage to more veterans of the Gulf War. The application dead-
line for these benefits is September 30, 2011. About 3,200 veterans were
approved for compensation prior to 2002. (For further information, contact
the nearest Veterans Administration office; go to www1.va.gov/directory/
guide/home.asp to locate a VA facility near you.)
Studying Chemical Imbalances
Research has shown that, among people with fibromyalgia, some important
body chemicals are significantly lower than normal, while others are signifi-
cantly higher. For example, a 2006 study published in the Journal of Psychiatric
Research compared the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in
47
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia

people with FMS and people without fibromyalgia. (BDNF is a protein in the
central nervous system.) The researchers found that BDNF concentrations in
the blood were significantly higher in the 41 patients with fibromyalgia than in
the 45 patients without fibromyalgia. However, why the BDNF levels were
higher in patients with fibromyalgia is unknown, and further research is still
needed.
Some experts believe that the cause of excessive or deficient levels of body
chemicals is due to a brain abnormality related to the interaction between
important organs that regulate body chemicals, such as the hypothalamus,
pituitary gland, and adrenal glands. What is generally accepted is that exces-
sive or deficient levels of certain hormones from the hypothalamus, thyroid,
pituitary, and adrenal glands could contribute to or cause fibromyalgia-type
symptoms.
Impairments in these glands that cause deviations from the normal level of
body chemicals can lead to troublesome difficulties with sleep, an increased
risk for pain, and greater degrees of muscle pain, especially morning stiffness.
They may also cause other symptoms that are commonly associated with
fibromyalgia, such as fatigue and brain fog, and hormonal abnormalities may
worsen other medical conditions.
No one knows for sure what causes fibromyalgia, although a wide array of
theories abound. Evidence is mounting, however, for profound central ner-
vous system abnormalities in FMS. Much of the scientific data strongly impli-
cate stress-related factors that result in abnormalities of the autonomic
nervous system as well as neuro-endocrine axes (brain-hormone axes include
the pituitary-adrenal gland connection) of FMS patients. Fibromyalgia is not
just an extreme form of chronic musculoskeletal pain in the general popula-
tion. For people with fibromyalgia, speculating on why they’ve developed
FMS is certainly an interesting topic — but it isn’t as important as actively
working with doctors and other health-care providers on a good plan to mini-
mize the pain, fatigue, and other symptoms.
Substance P = Pain
Substance P is a brain/pain neurochemical with the main purpose of sending
pain messages to the body. “It’s time to hurt! Say ‘ouch!’” Normally, this pain
message isn’t a bad thing, because people need to feel pain when they experi-
ence harm, so that they can take the appropriate action to resolve the situa-
tion. The problem with fibromyalgia, however, is that the pain signal that the
individual feels is way out of proportion to minor injuries or illnesses. (Read
more about pain in Chapter 4.)
Researchers have demonstrated that people with FMS generate abnormally
high levels of Substance P. In fact, studies have shown that some people with
48
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

fibromyalgia have as much as three times the levels of Substance P in their
cerebrospinal fluid (a special fluid found in the backbone) than is found in
people who don’t have fibromyalgia.
Experts don’t know whether excessive levels of Substance P are the cause of
fibromyalgia symptoms or the result of them. And, actually, experts don’t
even know if Substance P is either the cause or the result of FMS at all. The
high amount of Substance P could just be a by-product of other biochemical
processes. (Yes, I know that trying to categorize the cause of this elusive
fibromyalgia syndrome can be very frustrating — sort of like trying to nail
down Jell-O. Just when you think you have it figured out, it slips away.)
Everyone’s body releases some amount of Substance P as a normal course of
events when painful stimuli occur. But you certainly don’t want to have
excessive levels of Substance P in your body. Unfortunately, you can’t flip a
“halfway” or a “low” switch in your brain to scale things down if your body is
churning out too much of this chemical. For now, your brain’s control panel
is currently inaccessible. Instead, medications and treatments must be used
to counteract the effects of Substance P and the accompanying array of
symptoms that are associated with fibromyalgia.
49
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia
Actions that can make fibromyalgia worse
This chapter focuses on possible causes of
fibromyalgia, but you should also know some
basics about what can aggravate an existing
case of FMS in many people. So here’s a quick
list of watch-out-for items for you to consider:
 Consuming copious quantities of alcohol:
You may think that alcohol will help you fall
asleep, so why not have a few drinks before
going to bed? The reality is that you may
pass out from drinking, but you’ll usually
wake up in the middle of the night feeling
awful. (Read more about alcohol and
fibromyalgia in Chapter 15.)
 Staying up very late and skimping on your
sleep time: In fact, some experts believe
that inadequate sleep can actually cause
FMS, not just worsen it. (When you read
Chapter 14, you find out why sleep depriva-
tion is so bad. But the short answer is that
inadequate sleep can really worsen exist-
ing fibromyalgia for most people.)
 Stressing out in a major way about your
personal, work, or family problems:
Stressing out on just about anything, in fact,
can really aggravate your symptoms,
making it important for FMS sufferers to
figure out how to relax. (Read more about
depressurizing yourself in Chapter 13.)
 Consuming only junk food, like soda,
chocolate, and sugary foods and drinks:
Ouch! You’re going to regret it when the
pain kicks in. (Chapter 15 offers good advice
on good foods and bad foods.)
 Experiencing changing weather condi-
tions: You can try to wish bad weather
away, but it won’t work. However, you can
anticipate its effects on you. (See Chapter 2
for more information on weather sensitivity.)

Neurochemically affecting your 
pain or symptomatic levels
Some studies of people with fibromyalgia have indicated that other neuro-
chemicals, in addition to Substance P, may be possible causes or contribu-
tors to the problem. Thyroid hormone is a critically important hormone that
regulates the body’s energy expenditure and metabolism. Some people who
suffer from chronic fatigue, wide-ranging muscle pain, and sleep disturbances
are ultimately found to have elevated or depressed levels of circulating thy-
roid hormone. This can occur for many reasons, but, in most instances, can
be appropriately controlled, leading to improvement in symptoms.
Cortisol is an important hormone that’s secreted by the adrenal glands in a
circadian rhythm. Most of your cortisol is produced early in the morning
(around 3 a.m.), but dips to low levels in the evening. It maintains blood pres-
sure, blood sugar, and other important biological functions that help people
cope with stress. Studies indicate that some people with FMS have abnormal
circadian rhythms of cortisol secretion resulting in low levels of cortisol
during daytime (making them feel fatigued) and too much cortisol at night
(causing insomnia).
People with fibromyalgia sometimes experience below-normal levels of brain
chemicals, such as serotonin, a calming brain chemical. Also, some people
with fibromyalgia have below-normal levels of growth hormones, which are
hormones that even adults have that perform basic repair work at the cellu-
lar level. Insufficient growth-hormone levels may mean that damaged cells
stay damaged longer, causing pain and other symptoms.
Examining Environmental Causes
Maybe some people’s bodies react to an allergy quite extremely by exhibiting
fibromyalgia symptoms, or maybe some people consume a substance and
react negatively to it, causing the FMS symptoms to occur. Doctors don’t
know for sure, so the studies continue.
Considering an allergic reaction
Another theory about FMS is that it may result from the body’s allergic reac-
tion to something else in the environment, whether it’s chemicals, smoke, or
other irritants. This may be why antihistamines can make some people with
fibromyalgia feel better — the antihistamine drugs quell the action of the
body’s histamines (chemicals released by the body when confronted with an
allergic agent).
50
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Experiencing a hypersensitivity to chemicals
Some people may be overly sensitive to many chemicals in their environ-
ment. Most people in the United States are constantly exposed to a barrage of
chemicals, but their bodies can usually cope with them. However, some
people may go into a sort of “systems overload.” They don’t actually die, but
their bodies react so strongly that it may lead to the pain, sleep difficulties,
muscular stiffness, and other problems that are characteristic of fibromyal-
gia. Some people respond very severely to cigarette smoke, perfumes, and
industrial chemicals.
Feeling the effects of phosphates
Some people are convinced that people with fibromyalgia build up storage
areas of chemicals in their bodies that clog up their systems with substances
that the kidneys are unable to excrete fast enough. They see the primary cul-
prit causing fibromyalgia as a series of numerous, heavy deposits of phos-
phates — chemicals stemming from products containing the element of
phosphorus.
The theory is that substances containing salicylate, including aspirin itself,
generate phosphates; it is also believed by some that topical ointments con-
taining aspirin and other products also proliferate phosphates. This is why
guaifenesin has been advocated to help break up the phosphates that are
supposedly present.
Guaifenesin is a drug that’s available in both prescribed and over-the-counter
dosages; it’s normally taken to treat coughs. Guaifenesin users believe that
doses of this medication can eventually alleviate the pain, fatigue, and other
symptoms of FMS, although clinical studies have yet to bear them out. (Read
more about the use of guaifenesin in treating fibromyalgia in Chapter 9.)
Suffering from hyper-arousability
Some people with fibromyalgia, for whatever reason (hormonal, viral, or
something else), become extremely sensitive to loud noises, strong light, and
other stimuli. Carol says that she stopped sleeping with her husband because
he snores. So, now, she sleeps in another room with a big blanket over the
closed window to keep out the noise and the light. Carol also got rid of a tick-
ing clock in the room, the noise of which she says drove her “wild.” Her chil-
dren call Carol’s new bedroom her “sensory-deprivation room.” Carol says
spending time in this room makes her feel much better. And it certainly
enables her to sleep better.
51
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia

It’s almost as if Carol, as well as some other people who have fibromyalgia,
have lost some of their basic sensory screening-out abilities. Or perhaps
they’re too sensitive, for whatever reason. Either way, they feel nearly as
overstimulated as a person suffering from autism, a disorder in which the
individual feels completely bombarded with stimuli, even in a low-key situa-
tion. The slightest touch, sound, or other stimulus causes irritation in the
autistic person, and as the stimulus increases in intensity, it causes physical
pain. (Of course, people with fibromyalgia are rarely autistic — I’m offering
this example only as a comparison.)
Exploring Other Theories
Other theories also try to explain why fibromyalgia strikes some people and
not others. For example, maybe it’s in the genes, and you inherit this propen-
sity from your parents. Or FMS may result from too much or too little exercis-
ing. Fibromyalgia may also be caused by a structural defect at the cellular
level. I explore all these possibilities in the following sections.
Linking genetics and fibromyalgia
Can something in your genes cause fibromyalgia? Can you really inherit the
risk for developing fibromyalgia if other people in your family are diagnosed
with the syndrome? Based on the reports of most FMS sufferers, fibromyalgia
seems to run in families. It’s also true that almost all chronic medical prob-
lems have a genetic basis.
Today, many doctors believe that numerous people may have a genetic predis-
position to a wide variety of different medical problems; however, something
in the environment (contracting a virus, being involved in a car crash, or
facing other types of severe trauma to the body) may have to actually trigger
this predisposition to developing fibromyalgia or other medical problems.
Doctors and researchers are working very hard to map the human genetic
codes and to try to determine which genes weaken the body and lead to med-
ical problems and which ones work to protect the body and prevent serious
illnesses. But the genetic link (if one or more particular links even exist) is
still unknown.
Despite this lack of evidence, many people are still convinced that fibromyal-
gia must be a hereditary medical problem. For example, Denise says that she
has always had fibromyalgia symptoms, and her mother and her two sisters
have them as well. Their symptoms flare up when they become very stressed
out and upset. But Denise is the only family member who has been diagnosed
with fibromyalgia so far.
52
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Denise has three children, and two of them — teenage girls, ages 14 and 16 —
have the very same overall painful symptoms that Denise and her sisters
suffer from. Denise thought that her daughters were too young to have
fibromyalgia, but she’s rethinking her position and plans to take the girls in
for medical evaluations. (Read more about children and adolescents with
fibromyalgia in Chapter 20.)
A shared environment
One potential problem with the genetic-cause theory is that people in nuclear
families (adults and children, usually two generations) generally also have a
shared environment. Because they live together and are in close contact with
each other, they come down with the same viruses and are exposed to the same
chemicals. They eat the same foods. They also share the same lifestyle — for
example, being very active or more on the sedentary side. As a result, if more
than one family member has fibromyalgia, the medical problem may actually
derive from some undefined element from within their shared environment,
rather than from a shared gene pool.
A research link
Dr. Muhammad B. Yunus at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in
Peoria, Illinois, has studied 40 families with fibromyalgia and looked at possi-
ble hereditary factors at work. His research has found a weak correlation
between the development of fibromyalgia in the HLA allele, a specific genetic
location. Dr. Yunus and other researchers are continuing to look for specific
genetic markers that may lead to the development of fibromyalgia among
family members.
Looking at who is most at risk in your family
Because fibromyalgia is generally more prominently found among females
than males, if FMS does actually run in families, you may expect to find it
more frequently in your mother, sisters, aunts, grandmothers, and other
female blood relatives rather than in your father, brothers, uncles, grandfa-
thers, and other male blood relations. But keep an open mind. Men can have
fibromyalgia, too, so it doesn’t hurt to ask.
Even if practically everyone in your family seems to have all or most of the symp-
toms of fibromyalgia, this doesn’t mean that you or your other relatives have
FMS. And even if there is a genetic predisposition to FMS, this merely means that
some people in the family may develop fibromyalgia, and others will not.
Exercising too little or too much
Some doctors and experts theorize that another underlying cause of fibromyal-
gia may be related to an extreme decrease or extreme increase in activity.
53
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia

Basically, this means that playing the role of couch potato can transform a
person into an unhappy fibromyalgiac. At the other end of the spectrum, a
person can excessively exercise to the point that he has overstressed his body
and inadvertently caused the onset of fibromyalgia symptoms.
In general, people with fibromyalgia have a lower pain threshold and a greater
sensitivity to painful stimuli, and they also feel pain significantly longer after a
painful event than people who don’t have fibromyalgia. What causes this
hypersensitivity to painful stimuli is not entirely clear, but it’s apparent that
this extreme pain sensitivity can impair a person’s overall functioning, causing
a negative downward spiral unless and until the cycle is broken. (Read
Chapter 4 for more information on pain issues and fibromyalgia.)
As a result of this pain sensitivity, both under-exercising and over-exercising
can worsen fibromyalgia pain. For example, Lethargic Lucy rarely exercises
because it hurts too much. She’s gotten very out of shape, which in turn has
caused her pain to worsen. At the other end of the spectrum, Dynamic Diana,
an overly enthusiastic exerciser with fibromyalgia, is far more fit than
Lethargic Lucy. But she’s also more likely to incur injuries, along with the
pain she incurs from excessive exercising. (Read Chapter 15 for important
advice on exercise when you have FMS).
Considering muscular or 
structural abnormalities
Some researchers, using expensive high-tech electronic microscopes and
other very specialized equipment, have studied tissue samples from people
with fibromyalgia. They’ve found that FMS patients are more likely to have
damaged muscle tissue than people who don’t have fibromyalgia. Research
continues on this high-tech front.
Suffering from a combo platter 
of illnesses
Maybe fibromyalgia results from a variety of different causes that interact
with each other in a bad way. For example, perhaps some families have a
genetic predisposition to an allergy. If that genetic propensity interacts with
allergy-inducing substances, then the result may be FMS. On the other hand,
maybe some families have less effective immune systems, and its members
54
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

are more at risk for contracting viruses and bacterial infections — and this
combination together may cause fibromyalgia. It may also be true that some
families tend to have overactive immune systems, and their members are
more at risk for experiencing a triggering of abnormal immune responses to
viruses and bacterial infections, which may cause fibromyalgia. There are
many possible combinations of circumstances that may lead to the develop-
ment of fibromyalgia.
Looking to the Future
You can drive yourself crazy trying to pin down the actual cause of fibromyal-
gia in yourself or other people. Research is actively ongoing, and I anticipate
many important breakthroughs in the near future.
For now, researchers and doctors can only theorize about what may cause
fibromyalgia. We do know, however, that whatever the causes, fibromyalgia is
a real syndrome that causes pain and suffering to millions of people, and it
needs to be taken seriously.
55
Chapter 3: Understanding Possible Causes of Fibromyalgia
Analyzing your family tree: What to ask
In attempting to determine whether members of
your extended family (primarily your parents
and siblings) have fibromyalgia, it’s best to avoid
asking them directly if they have FMS. They may
never have heard of it. Instead, ask them if they
frequently have lots of muscle pain, particularly
around the neck, shoulders, and back areas.
Then ask if the pain seems to move around a lot,
sometimes it’s in the neck, sometimes in the
shoulder, and so forth. (Fibromyalgia pain often
moves from place to place.) Keep in mind that
older relatives (over age 65) may have pain in
those areas, but it could be pain that’s associ-
ated with arthritis.
Then ask your relatives about any problems
with continuous and severe fatigue. Make sure
they understand you’re not talking about simple
tiredness from a hard day but rather a constant
and extreme fatigue. If you receive another
“yes,” continue on with the other symptoms that
often appear with fibromyalgia, such as sleep
problems, chronic headaches, irritable bowel
syndrome, and so forth. Do not, however,
announce to your relatives who seem to “qual-
ify” that you know that they have fibromyalgia,
even if they say “yes” to every symptom, and it
seems glaringly obvious to you that, of course,
they must have FMS. Many medical conditions
can be confused with fibromyalgia, and only a
doctor can really determine whether a person
has FMS (see Chapter 6 for more information).

P
ain is bad. But pain is also good. And yes, these seemingly contradictory
statements are both true. I know that the idea of pain as a useful thing is
very hard to wrap your mind around when you’re suffering from frequent and
severe pain. And yet, gaining an understanding of both the pros and the cons
of pain is important. Why? Because knowledge about your pain is one giant
step toward mastery over it. And wouldn’t you like to be more in charge of
your fibromyalgia pain?
The main problem with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is that your pain is out
of control, like the proverbial headless chicken. Another problem with
fibromyalgia is that chronic and sustained pain, such as the kind that many
people with fibromyalgia most frequently experience, can be very bad for the
body. The key with fibromyalgia pain is to control it, keeping it from a scream
to a whisper.
In this chapter, I describe the purpose of pain — and it really does have a
purpose (actually, more than one). I also talk about pain management and its
importance. You may not (and usually can’t) succeed at wiping out all your
fibromyalgia pain forever. But you can tame it from a raging wild stallion to a
sort of gentle nag, and, in most cases, you can also lead a far more normal life
than you may be experiencing right now.

58
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 
Grasping Pain and Why 
People Have to Have It
If you have fibromyalgia, you know what pain is because you feel it probably
every day and at differing levels of intensity. You’d probably like to “grasp”
your fibromyalgia pain and throw it out the window forever. But before you
explore ways to get rid of pain, you first need to understand pain: what it is
and why you feel it.
Pain defined
Pain (mild to severe discomfort stemming from an injury, an illness, or from
unknown sources) comes from one of two types of stimuli:
 An outside stimulus: The “Ouch! That hurts!” pain response from a
paper cut, for example.
 An internal stimulus: Tightened muscles, for example.
Pain can be chronic or acute:
 Acute pain is pain that’s always temporary.
 Chronic pain is pain that is sometimes worse and sometimes better, but
it’s basically always hanging around at some level.
With fibromyalgia, the pain is chronic no matter what caused the initial trauma
to the body — whether it was an outside stimulus, such as an accidental injury,
or an internal stimulus, such as a virus or something else altogether.
Its advantages and disadvantages
I know it’s hard to believe, but pain plays a crucial and good role in your life.
Here are the primary advantages of pain to human bodies:
 Pain provides an early warning system of harm to the body and helps
you detect damage or medical problems before they get out of control.
For example, if you have pain with urination, this pain may indicate a
bladder infection. If you have chronic headaches, the cause may be
sinusitis or a more serious medical problem. If you have constant pain
after eating, you may have chronic heartburn or another medical condi-
tion. In each of these cases, your pain warns you to see your doctor for
further evaluation. Without pain, a medical problem can worsen without
your knowledge.

 Pain enables us to take action now to stop the pain. Of course, you
can’t go rushing off to the doctor every time you have a minor ache or
pain. But if your pain is severe and/or chronic, your body is sending you
a message. It’s telling you that something is wrong. Do something about
it right now! Ignoring your pain can be perilous to your health.
 Pain allows you to avoid worse pain. When you know that something
continues to bother you, you can (with your physician’s help) work on
treating the problem and try to identify patterns that seem to worsen
the pain. Armed with that information, you can then avoid (or try to
avoid) the painful stimulus in the future. For example, if you know that a
bear hug is going to make you ache for days (because it’s happened
before), you can warn people ahead of time that they really need to be
gentle with you.
Pain can be very problematic, not only because pain hurts but also because it
may lead to some long-term problems. In general, pain can be bad for your
body for three main reasons:
 Chronic pain wears down the body. Like a truck spinning its wheels in
the mud, smoke pouring from the engine, your body starts to break
down under the added strain of chronic pain.
 People who have chronic pain are prone to other illnesses. Their
immune systems may become weakened, and they may become more at
risk for contracting the flu or the latest virus making the rounds among
their family, friends, and co-workers. If you find yourself getting a strep
throat and then the flu and then a bladder infection, you need your
doctor’s help to break out of this pattern. One way to break away is to
accept the fact that chronic illness and pain are part of your problem,
ask for help, and then work on rebuilding your health.
 Pain can harm your quality of life. When pain is the pervasive influ-
ence in your life, you may find it hard to think about anything else or to
achieve much of anything. When you’re in severe pain, you may have
trouble simply getting out of bed, let alone going to work to put in your
eight or more hours. Pain also seeps into (or maybe floods into) other
aspects of your life. For example, you can’t help your child with his
homework when you’re overwhelmed with pain, nor can you pay atten-
tion to your partner or your friends.
Don’t start doubting yourself when people say that they can’t find anything
wrong with you. Causes for chronic pain are frequently hard to detect. But
the pain itself is always real. You don’t feel chronic pain solely because you’re
upset or depressed or anxious or annoyed. You may be all those things —
especially when people imply that your fibromyalgia pain is imaginary! But
the pain itself is an independent and very real entity.

Chapter 4: Understanding Fibromyalgia Pain

Regarding the Different Kind 
of Pain That’s Fibromyalgia
Based on my research and the research of others, I can tell you that the pain
that comes with fibromyalgia has three primary aspects. Very basically,
people with fibromyalgia feel pain
 Faster than others do: FMS sufferers have a lowered pain threshold,
meaning that, for example, if someone stuck a pin in you and another one
in Susan (who doesn’t have fibromyalgia), you’d probably yell before she
would. (Read Chapter 3 for possible causes of this heightened pain.)
 Worse than others do: When you have fibromyalgia, you feel the pain
more strongly. In fact, some light touch that wouldn’t bother Susan at all
60
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 
My pain studies on fibromyalgia
My FMS research over the last ten years has
clearly shown that patients with fibromyalgia
are very sensitive to very mild pain stimuli, like
pressure or heat. Why? Because the nerve end-
ings in their muscles and other tissues have
become sensitized over time. A small reason for
this change in the nerve endings is genetic, but
the major reason is acquired tissue changes
over the years.
Most people’s overall pain sensitivity briefly
goes up when they’re hurt with minor injuries,
and most often this change in sensitivity is very
small. But if you have FMS, this increased pain
sensitivity has a very hard time reverting back
to normal, so you become more and more sen-
sitive to everyday bumps and bruises. Similar to
people with frequent infections, your defenses
are down — not your defenses against bacte-
ria and viruses, but your defenses against pain.
This concept is a very important one, because,
just as you can strengthen your immunity to
infections, you can strengthen your pain
defenses. You can become more resilient to
pain and feel more like a person without FMS.
As you may imagine, strengthening your pain
defenses may be a slow process and it will
require some work — but you can do it.
When you have fibromyalgia, your first order of
business is to keep your pain from getting any
worse. Avoid the daily common mistakes many
people with FMS make, like not stretching, not
exercising, or not sticking to a healthy diet.
Find out what helps you fight your pain the most,
so that you can use those techniques to
decrease it. Some of the techniques you may try
include improving your sleep, making aerobic
exercise a part of your day, reducing your
stress, and taking medications and medical
treatments.
Use your own individual pain fighters to help
you reduce your long-term pain level.
Identifying your most effective pain fighters is
not always an easy process, but it’s worth it
because the major payoff is that you’ll feel sig-
nificantly better.

may really aggravate you. Some people with fibromyalgia say that when
they’re feeling bad, even something as normally benign as a cat rubbing
up against them actually hurts.
 For a longer time period than others do: The pain keeps going and
going and going, like the Energizer Bunny of pain. Suppose that Susan
was pricked with a pin 20 minutes ago, and she’s already forgotten about
it and is outside raking leaves or talking on the phone with her friends.
But you, with your fibromyalgia, are still sitting there, and you’re still
hurting.
Working with Your Doctor to 
Manage Fibromyalgia Pain
Some pain can be cured permanently, but most chronic pain, such as the pain
of FMS, can’t be eradicated altogether and forever. Instead, the goal should
be to manage FMS pain by radically decreasing it to a tolerable level. You can
attain this goal through pain management. With the help of a good doctor (or
two or more — sometimes, you need the help of a specialist as well as your
regular doctor), you can beat most pain into submission.
Pain management refers to all the actions that you and your doctor take to
decrease (but usually not altogether eliminate) your fibromyalgia pain. It can
be an action as simple as taking Tylenol or as complicated as combining med-
ication with acupuncture, exercise, massage, and other options. The bottom
line is that you were up at here (wherever that pain level was) when you
started, and then you go down to here (a lower level of pain) if the pain man-
agement has worked for you.
The best way to get pain relief is to work with a caring and knowledgeable
doctor who listens to you and works to act in your best interests. And yes,
such doctors are out there! If your doctor isn’t helping you, you need to think
about moving on to a doctor who will help you. (Read Chapter 7 for help on
finding a good doctor.)
Define your terms
The first step in managing the pain is to find out exactly how your doctor
defines pain management. I know what I mean by pain management, but the
term doesn’t mean the same thing to all doctors. To one physician, pain man-
agement may mean that you’re radically improved. To another, it may mean
that you aren’t calling her anymore, so you must be better. And the term has
still other meanings to other doctors.
61
Chapter 4: Understanding Fibromyalgia Pain

Find out how your doctor defines pain management by asking the following
questions:
 Does pain management mean a cure? In most cases, doctors will say
“no.” If the pain could be eliminated, it wouldn’t need to be “managed.”
So, if the doctor says, “Yes, I can cure you,” find another doctor.
 Can most patients get some pain relief? The right answer is nearly
always “yes,” “usually,” or “in most cases.” If the doctor says “no,” you
can’t get any pain relief for your fibromyalgia, find another doctor.
 What do you consider “success” in pain management? I don’t have the
space here to evaluate the many possible answers you may hear. Just
listen carefully to what your doctor says, and determine whether her
answer makes sense to you.
After you and your doctor agree on what pain management is and what to
expect from it, ask him to help you formulate a plan to set you on the right
path to managing your pain.
Plan a course of treatment
The doctor can’t feel your pain, so she’ll usually ask you how bad it is, on a
scale of 1 to 10 — with 1 being minor pain and 10 being extremely severe
pain. When your doctor knows how much pain you’re in, she’ll decide upon a
course of action for you to try. She may prescribe medication, along with a
hands-on therapy (such as heating or icing the painful area; I cover both
options in Chapter 11).
Generally, the doctor will want you to follow her recommendations for a
given period of time — which may be days or weeks — and will advise you to
come back after that time for a follow-up visit. Listen carefully to what your
doctor recommends (it doesn’t hurt to take notes!), and follow her instruc-
tions as closely as possible. If the recommendation doesn’t work at all and
your pain is still severe, tell the doctor, and she’ll work on seeking other solu-
tions for you.
Chart any changes
Part of working with your doctor is making sure that you report when you
feel worse or better. Don’t assume that your doctor somehow knows that this
new drug or treatment is great or terrible for you. Physicians are smart, but
they aren’t mind readers. Let your doctor know about the bad and the good.
If something helps you, it may help others who are in fibromyalgia hell.
62
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

One way to help you track whether you’re getting better, getting worse, or
staying about the same is to document in a special diary how you feel.
Without this diary, you can very easily forget and think that you felt much
worse (or maybe think you didn’t feel that bad, when you did). Having a writ-
ten record is essential.
To help you track how you feel, I’ve created a simple pain and symptom diary
for you to use (shown in Table 4-1). Photocopy it or you can just copy the
entries elsewhere, such as in a spiral notebook. If you love computers, you
can create a spreadsheet. The key is to choose a format that’s easy enough
for you to use that you’ll use it every day.

Chapter 4: Understanding Fibromyalgia Pain
Studies on women and pain
If you’re a woman with fibromyalgia who thinks
her pain may be undertreated, you may be right.
In their article for a 2001 issue of the Journal 
of Law, Medicine & Ethics, authors Diane E.
Hoffmann and Anita J. Tarzian analyzed studies
of how men and women perceived pain, as well
as how their pain was regarded by doctors and
nurses. The authors said that because women
have pain more often than men and they’re
more pain sensitive, it would seem as though
they’d be treated by doctors at least as well as
men are. And yet, they aren’t. Instead, women
who report pain are less likely to be taken seri-
ously and also less likely to receive adequate
treatment for their pain.
Other researchers have shown that women
experience fibromyalgia pain more and longer
than men do. If you’re a woman with fibromyal-
gia, don’t let anyone tell you that your pain isn’t
real. (You can read more about women and
fibromyalgia in Chapter 5.)

I suggest that you make entries in your pain diary even if you don’t have any
pain or much pain on one particular day, so that you’ll have an accurate
record. (Perhaps your pain management treatments are working. You’ll want
to record that.) You should also list any moderate to serious stress you faced,
ranging from trouble at work or home to anything else that you know causes
you to feel distressed.
For example, say that Tom, who’s recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia,
started keeping his own pain diary. His first week’s entries might look like the
diary in Table 4-2.

As you can see from his chart, on Monday, Tom had severe pain at a level 9.
That was also the day he started a new pain medication. On Tuesday, Tom
had some pain but felt much better, and his pain was down to a 6. Nothing
much else happened that day, so Tom wrote “no” for new treatments and
“usual” for stress.
Then on Wednesday, Tom’s pain went up a little to a 7. That was also the day
his boss yelled at him, which he noted in his diary. (Stress can increase pain,
but it can’t create it.) Tom’s pain was down to a 5 on Saturday but then went
back up to a 7 on Sunday, when he was worried about his mother’s health. All
told, however, a 5 or a 6 is much better than a 9 on the pain scale (which is
where Tom started out). Consequently, the medication was a success.
Move on to Plan B
Sometimes, when your doctor recommends a drug or a treatment, even if he’s
certain that this option is the most wonderful remedy on the planet, it just
won’t work for you. Give it a fair trial, though. Don’t expect instant results
from anything.
64
Part I: The What, When, and Why of Fibromyalgia 

Some treatments may take days or weeks, and others may take months
before you feel significantly better. How do you know how long is long
enough before you should move on to Plan B and try something else? This
decision really varies depending on the treatment. But to evaluate whether
your pain management is having a significant effect, consider the following:
 Have you followed the doctor’s recommendations or treatments? If the
doctor told you to take a medication daily for a month and you took it
once or twice, you didn’t give it a fair trial.
 How long did the doctor tell you it would take for you to have any
improvement? If the doctor said you’d feel better in several weeks, and
that time has passed and your pain is still unabated, it isn’t working. But
if it’s only been a few days, give it some more time.
65
Chapter 4: Understanding Fibromyalgia Pain
Are you a painiac?
If pain is completely dominating your life and it’s
also impairing your work and your relationships
with others (as is the case for many people with
fibromyalgia), you’re probably also distressed
and upset much of the time. I’ve coined the very
tongue-in-cheek term painiac to denote a
person whose life is dominated by pain and its
effects. Many people with fibromyalgia can
easily slip into painiac status, but they shouldn’t
have to. They need to ask, or, if necessary,
demand some help from their doctors.
Take this brief self-test to find out if you may
qualify as a painiac. Answer “true” or “false” to
the following questions and then read further
for an analysis of your answers:
1. I turn down most invitations, including
those to events I’d otherwise like to go to,
because the pain is too great. Or I fear that
it could become bad, so I say no.
2. If someone I care about needs help with a
project, whether it’s sewing on a button or
asking me to read a term paper, I usually
decline because of the pain.
3. I have few (or no) pain-free days.
4. I have given up physical activities that I
used to enjoy.
Now, you need to analyze your answers. If you
answered “true” to question 1, you’ve indicated
that you may be at painiac status now. After the
pain is under control, most people can return to
socializing and other activities they like.
In question 2, if you answered “true,” you’re at
risk for painiac status.
If you answered “true” to question 3, your life is
dominated by pain. It’s beyond time for you to
step up and recognize that you’ve got a prob-
lem, and it’s likely that you are a painiac. If your
doctor can’t or won’t help you, find another
doctor. (Turn to Chapter 7 for help on identifying
a good physician.)
If you answered “true” to question 4, you’re at
risk for becoming a painiac. Talk to your doctor
about it and ask for help.

Sometimes, people with fibromyalgia (or their doctors) attribute virtually any
pain to their fibromyalgia. Your head hurts, and you think it’s your fibromyal-
gia. Your back acts up — it’s that pesky fibromyalgia again. Your toe aches, so
it must be fibromyalgia. But people with FMS can have pain from problems
other than fibromyalgia. If you experience any of the following, contact your
doctor right away — these problems may indicate a medical condition that
has nothing to do with your FMS:
 The pain is sudden and far more extreme than it has ever been before.
 The pain is accompanied by symptoms that you haven’t seen before,
such as dizziness, a racing pulse, weakness, or mental confusion.
 You experience bleeding or visible body changes, such as extreme pale-
ness or redness.

f you think that you’re alone with your fibromyalgia,
well, think again! About 6 million people in the United
States (mostly women, but also some men) and millions
more worldwide know exactly what you’re going through.
Who are these people? I’m glad you asked that question
because that’s the subject of Chapter 5, where I describe
patterns found among people most likely to suffer from
fibromyalgia.
Part II is about discovering whether you have fibromyal-
gia, and part of that process is ruling out medical prob-
lems that may be impostors for your real problem of
fibromyalgia. These conditions include chronic fatigue
syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, thyroid disease,
forms of arthritis, and a few other illnesses that may sur-
prise you, such as Lyme disease, lupus, and Raynaud’s
phenomenon (all discussed in Chapter 6). Then I move
into diagnosing fibromyalgia. A good doctor is crucial to
diagnosing and treating fibromyalgia, and I discuss the
important role that doctors play in Chapter 7. I also offer
advice on working with your regular doctor and, if that
doesn’t work, finding a new doc. Then I cover what actu-
ally happens (or should happen) during your physical
exam to find out whether you have fibromyalgia.

M
aybe you’re a woman who has fibromyalgia. In addition to you, your
sister has it, your daughter has it, and you think that your mother
probably has it as well, although she hasn’t been diagnosed yet. All the key
women in your family seem to have fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Not only
that, but your brother who served in the Gulf Wars or in Afghanistan is also
experiencing some symptoms that sound an awful lot like the ones you and
your female relatives all share: widespread pain, fatigue, sleep difficulties,
and other shared symptoms.
Almost anyone can develop fibromyalgia. But there are general patterns
among the people who are the most likely to be diagnosed with FMS; for
example, women are much more frequently found to have fibromyalgia than
are men (although men can and do have fibromyalgia, and there are indica-
tions that men may have FMS more often than realized in the past). Adults
are more prone to being diagnosed with fibromyalgia than are children,
although children can also have FMS. (Read more about children and adoles-
cents with fibromyalgia in Chapter 20.)
This chapter covers the types of people most likely to develop fibromyalgia.
At the same time, it includes information on men with fibromyalgia who may
be even less likely to receive a diagnosis than women. In addition, I discuss a
possible explanation for why women may suffer from fibromyalgia more than
men: In general, women actually experience pain more acutely than men do.

70
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 
Looking at the Numbers: 
Who Has Fibromyalgia?
About 6 million people in the United States and millions more worldwide
have fibromyalgia, and most studies indicate that the overwhelming majority
of people who are diagnosed with FMS (80 percent to 90 percent) are adult
women roughly of childbearing age (about 20 to 45 years old), although some
men and some children and adolescents also suffer from and are diagnosed
with fibromyalgia. Many women diagnosed with fibromyalgia are white
women, although women of any race may develop fibromyalgia.
There are several possibilities to consider here. These numbers may exist
simply because they’re valid, and because most of the people who actually
do have fibromyalgia really are young and middle-aged Caucasian females. On
the other hand, many physicians may not be looking for FMS in children or
teenagers, just as they may not be looking for it in males, in women under age
20 or over age 45, in nonwhite women, and so forth. Simply put, if FMS isn’t in
the doctor’s constellation of possibilities, often, he’s just not going to find it
among his patients.
It’s not that he’s a bad doctor. Instead, FMS simply isn’t the first (and maybe
not the second, third, fourth, and so on) thing that a physician usually looks
for among people who fit into these other groups — even when a male or a
teenager of either sex exhibits symptoms that seem consistent with a diagno-
sis of fibromyalgia (widespread pain, muscle stiffness, tender points, chronic
fatigue, sleep problems, and so on).
As a result, if you don’t fit into the basic patterns of people who usually have
fibromyalgia, you may want to ask your doctor if you could possibly have this
medical problem, even though you’re generally regarded as “too young” or
“too old” to be considered a candidate — or even though you’re a man or a
nonwhite woman.
Wondering Why Women Suffer More
than Men from Fibromyalgia
Research has shown that women are significantly more sensitive to painful
stimuli than most men are, and this pain sensitivity is particularly true with
regard to the soft tissues and muscles that are examined by physicians. (Soft
tissue and muscle pain can stem from damage or defects to the musculoskele-
tal system, such as strains, tears, or fractures. Rarely, it comes from infections
or organic defects or damage, such as heart attack or stroke.) Studies have

also revealed that women are often more likely than men to seek out doctors
when they feel pain, and they’re also more likely than men to complain when
they experience pain.
Some experts believe that women’s higher level of pain sensitivity may well
be what causes females to become much more at risk for developing
fibromyalgia than men. Or, as the authors of Muscle Pain: Understanding Its
Nature, Diagnosis, and Treatment put it, “The greater sensitivity of women to
painful stimuli may help to explain why there are approximately seven times
as many women as men with fibromyalgia.” They also added, “It comes as a
surprise to many male practitioners that women frequently experience more
pain that do men in response to the same stimulus.”
It’s not that doctors don’t appreciate the pain that many women suffer from.
Instead, the reality is that many physicians, along with most people in the
general public, haven’t learned yet about studies indicating a greater pain
sensitivity among women. But medical school professors like me are working
hard to find out why some women actually hurt more than some men do. And
until more studies are performed to determine gender pain differences
among men and women with fibromyalgia, the issue remains up in the air.
Considering How Fibromyalgia 
Relates to Women’s Ages
FMS is most commonly diagnosed in women who are between the ages of 20
and 45. In this section, I give you more information on how age and FMS cor-
relate in women of different ages, from young adulthood and middle age to
women in their 50s and older.
Young and middle-aged women 
and menstruation
Young and middle-aged women may both suffer from fibromyalgia. Young
women may find that they’re experiencing the onset of their fibromyalgia
symptoms, or they may have had FMS for years. (I’m defining young women
as females who are ages 18 to about 39, after which they can be better
defined as women who are in their middle years.) Young women also may be
prone to trying hard to ignore the problem, concentrating instead on the
demands of their jobs and their children, and trying to work despite their
pain and fatigue.
71
Chapter 5: Who Gets Picked to Have Fibromyalgia?

Many women in early middle age (I’m defining middle age as 40 to the mid-
50s) are more likely to experience problems with obesity and the onset of
other health problems, such as arthritis. Fibromyalgia and its symptoms may
be a burden that’s laid on top of other emerging and serious health problems
that middle-aged women experience.
FMS doesn’t seem to be linked to perimenopause (the onset of menopause, or
the cessation of menstruation), although studies need to be done to deter-
mine if such a link may exist. However, stress is strongly linked to fibromyal-
gia, and many women, especially in their late 40s or 50s, are members of the
“sandwich generation” — they’re responsible for teenage children as well as
caregiving for their aging parents. The stress that comes with this difficult
role may trigger fibromyalgia in women who are predisposed to the problem.
Putting off acknowledging that you have FMS is a mistake. You’re better off if
you work on your medical problems when they first develop because you
have a good chance of preventing them from getting much worse. You can’t
stop yourself from aging. But if you know that you have fibromyalgia as a
young woman, with the help of your physician, you can work on creating a
good plan of exercise, weight loss, and pain control. This plan may help you
to shortstop a future that’s clouded with much greater pain and more limita-
tions than you currently face.
Older women and menopause
No one knows how many older women (and men) may suffer from fibromyalgia,
but it seems likely that at least some do. In fact, one isolated study indicated
72
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 
Women with fibromyalgia have an increased 
risk for metabolic syndrome
Some studies have shown that women with
fibromyalgia are more likely to be overweight or
obese than other women and to have more med-
ical problems. One study, reported in a 2007 issue
of Metabolism Clinical and Experimental, found
that among 109 women with FMS, they had a 5.6
times greater risk of having metabolic syndrome
than women without FMS. Metabolic syndrome
is a serious health condition that is characterized
by abdominal obesity (a body shape like an apple
instead of a pear), high triglycerides, high blood
pressure, low levels of high-density lipoprotein
(HDL, the good cholesterol), and high fasting glu-
cose (blood sugar) levels. The researchers also
found that higher urinary levels of norepineph-
rine and cortisol were associated with a risk for
metabolic syndrome.

that FMS actually peaked at age 70, after which it appeared to drop off in inci-
dence. However, more studies need to be performed to determine the extent of
fibromyalgia among older women.
One possibility is that older people may have FMS, but they also may have
other medical problems that are so severe that they require a great deal of
attention, such as a history of stroke, cancer, heart attack, severe osteoarthri-
tis, diabetes, or other ailments. As a result, fibromyalgia may not seem like
such a big deal to physicians in comparison to these other, often life-
threatening, medical problems. (Although FMS is very painful, it’s not a life-
threatening condition.) It’s also true that sometimes FMS symptoms may be
ignored or even diagnosed as “you’re just getting older” by some physicians.
For more on menopause, turn to Menopause For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by
Marcia L. Jones, PhD, Theresa Eichenwald, MD, and Nancy W. Hall (Wiley).
Fibromyalgia and Men: It Isn’t 
Just a Woman Thing
Although the overwhelming majority of people who are diagnosed with
fibromyalgia are women, it’s definitely possible for a man to have FMS, too. In
fact, considering the major difficulty that some women report that they’ve
had to go through in getting a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, a man with the same
medical problem may have an even harder time receiving an accurate diagno-
sis of his condition.
One study, reported in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology in 2006, looked at
the incidence of fibromyalgia based on actual diagnoses made in medical
claims from 1997 to 2002. The results were surprising: The researchers found
that although women were more likely to have been diagnosed with
fibromyalgia than men, it was by a much lower ratio (by 1.64 times) than
reported in many other studies. They also found that patients with FMS (male
and female) were from two to seven times more likely than patients without
fibromyalgia to also have other conditions, such as headaches, depression,
anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
Some men with fibromyalgia are military veterans, particularly from the Gulf
Wars. (For more information on this topic, read Chapter 3.) Whether they’re
veterans or nonveterans, however, the symptoms that men experience are
generally the same as the symptoms felt by women, although some men with
fibromyalgia report that their fatigue is far more troublesome than the pain.
73
Chapter 5: Who Gets Picked to Have Fibromyalgia?

Tom is 42 years old and says that he had a difficult time obtaining a diagno-
sis. It wasn’t until Tom asked his doctor if his problem could be the same
thing as his sister had (she’d been diagnosed with FMS) that it occurred to
the physician to consider fibromyalgia. After the doctor started thinking
about FMS as a possibility for Tom’s tender points, fatigue, and other symp-
toms, he said that it seemed very obvious that fibromyalgia was the correct
diagnosis for Tom’s condition. The possibility just hadn’t occurred to him
before, because Tom wasn’t a woman.
Men who think that they may have fibromyalgia should ask their doctors
about it, because some men do suffer from FMS. Fibromyalgia isn’t an
unmanly disease — although most men (like most women) would prefer not
to have it.

The trouble with “women’s troubles”
Laurie has had fibromyalgia symptoms her entire
life. But they’ve always been perceived as symp-
toms that were related to her gender. She says
that when she first started getting her period, the
symptoms were always attributed to menstrua-
tion — because she was going to get her period
or because she had her period or even because
her period had just finished. Somehow, the pain
in her body was always related to the bleeding,
according to the doctors.
When she got older, the problem became, basi-
cally, “getting older.” Laurie suspects that at
some point in the future, when she goes through
menopause, doctors will say that menopause is
causing all her body aches. Laurie says that it’s
almost like being female is a disease. (If you
think that your doctor regards womanhood as a
disease like Laurie’s doctors did, be sure to read
Chapter 7 on dealing with your doctor or finding
a new physician.)

can be confused with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and why I’ve
devoted a chapter to this topic. Self-empowerment is the reason. If you’re
diagnosed and treated for one of these other problems but you’re not getting
better, you may have fibromyalgia instead. In addition, many people with
fibromyalgia suffer from one or more medical conditions described in this
chapter.
Yet, sometimes, doctors diagnose only your arthritis or only your thyroid dis-
ease, and not your fibromyalgia. The reverse is also possible. You may be
diagnosed with only fibromyalgia when you could have thyroid disease,
arthritis, or another medical problem. Awareness of these other health prob-
lems can help you be a more informed health partner.
I start my discussion with medical problems that can be fibromyalgia
imposters (problems with symptoms like fibromyalgia, which may confuse or
delay the diagnosis) or fibromyalgia cohabitors (conditions that you may
have along with fibromyalgia) such as chronic fatigue syndrome or arthritis.
In addition, I cover several conditions with symptoms similar to fibromyalgia,
including Lyme disease, infectious mononucleosis, lower-back conditions,
and multiple chemical sensitivities syndrome.

Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 
Understanding the Uncertainty
Lauren’s doctor had explained to her that her X-rays, along with her symp-
toms of pain and muscle stiffness, clearly indicated that she had arthritis.
Using her X-rays, he illustrated the problems in her neck and back.
Lauren faithfully followed her doctor’s recommendations of medication and
exercise, and felt some better. Yet a lot of pain was still there and, oddly, it
sometimes moved from place to place. Could arthritis do that? Lauren also
had trouble sleeping at night. And she was very tired, all the time.
Lauren went back to the doctor and asked him to reconsider her condition.
Could something more than arthritis be at work? Her physician carefully
reviewed Lauren’s symptoms, her lab tests, and her medical history and came
to his diagnosis. The doctor told Lauren that she really did have arthritis —
and fibromyalgia. The pain that moved from place to place, along with her
other symptoms of insomnia and fatigue, tipped him off to the fibromyalgia.
Doctors should easily be able to distinguish FMS from all other medical con-
ditions, shouldn’t they? After all, they’re smart and they’re trained in the sci-
entific method. It should be a piece of cake for them, right? Unfortunately,
this viewpoint has several gaping problems.
One problem is that many different symptoms overlap between fibromyalgia
and an array of other frequently occurring medical problems. In fact, even
trained physicians often initially confuse fibromyalgia with several other
medical problems that may be present in their patients, such as chronic
fatigue syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, arthritis, or thyroid disease.
To muddy the water further, many people don’t have only fibromyalgia; they
have other medical conditions along with the fibromyalgia, as in Lauren’s
case. In these circumstances, the other medical problems can distract the
physician from diagnosing fibromyalgia. As a result, you shouldn’t be sur-
prised that some people are underdiagnosed — even by good physicians.
Happily, most physicians are increasingly adept at identifying and distin-
guishing fibromyalgia from other medical problems, and are also getting
better at effectively treating patients with FMS. But, to be on the safe side,
consumers should gain a basic general understanding of other diseases that
become confused with FMS, as well as attain an understanding of the differ-
ences between fibromyalgia and these other problems. Such knowledge may
give readers confidence to ask doctors more questions, as Lauren did.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by severe and long-term fatigue
and exhaustion. It’s also known as chronic fatigue/immune dysfunction syndrome
(CFIDS). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
more than 1 million people in the United States have CFS, although at best, 20
percent are diagnosed. Women have about four times the risk of suffering from
CFS as men.
I start with CFS because it’s probably the condition most frequently confused
with fibromyalgia. This confusion results partly from the fact that patients
with chronic fatigue syndrome often share many of the same symptoms as
people with fibromyalgia.
Although the two syndromes have many points of intersection, fibromyalgia
and chronic fatigue syndrome are different illnesses. However, diagnosis can
be difficult when the patient is burdened with symptoms of both fibromyalgia
and chronic fatigue syndrome — which happens all too often. According to
the CDC, 30 percent to 70 percent of patients with CFS have FMS.
About chronic fatigue syndrome
The prevailing symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome is an extreme and over-
whelming long-term exhaustion. Some research indicates that there may be
both a genetic and environmental basis to CFS, particularly with genes that
direct the body’s response to hormones and with neurotransmitters gener-
ated during times of stress and/or injury. However, specific genetic markers
have not been identified to date. One study found that childhood trauma
increased the risk of an adult developing CFS from three to eight times.
Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome say their exhaustion goes way beyond
the mere tiredness that most people without CFS feel sometimes. People who
have CFS feel completely overwhelmed and drained of all energy, even when
they haven’t been doing anything that would normally cause minor fatigue.
With FMS, in contrast, the fatigue that patients feel is often listed as their
second worst problem, or may be even farther down on their list of symp-
toms. Instead, pain is the paramount complaint for people with FMS.
Besides fatigue, many other symptoms are associated with having chronic
fatigue syndrome, such as an overall malaise, a hypersensitivity to lights and
noise, and chronic headaches in people who never had frequent headaches
prior to their onset of CFS. People with chronic fatigue syndrome may also
suffer from hypotension (low blood pressure) and syncope (fainting).
77
Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

In addition, many patients with CFS are prone to developing irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS), which means that they have varying degrees of belly pain
with diarrhea or constipation. These problems are also common to people
who have fibromyalgia, so physicians may have a hard time determining
whether CFS or fibromyalgia is the appropriate diagnosis.
How chronic fatigue syndrome 
differs from fibromyalgia
The difficulty in distinguishing CFS from fibromyalgia is sometimes compli-
cated by the fact that some people alternate between both medical condi-
tions. As a result, the physician may find it hard to diagnose each individual
medical problem. In addition, CFS is a diagnosis that doesn’t exclude other
diseases. Although there is no specific laboratory or imaging test for CFS,
your doctor will generally order an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) blood
test, a nonspecific test for inflammation also used to detect the presence of
rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme disease, and other diseases.
In general, if pain is the main complaint and the patient has other symptoms
common to fibromyalgia, such as tender points (specific areas of the body
that are sore, described in detail in Chapter 8), the medical problem is prob-
ably fibromyalgia.
In contrast, if the patient’s key complaint is extreme fatigue, followed by
other symptoms, such as pain and sleep difficulties, CFS is more likely to be
diagnosed as the prevailing problem.
Because these two syndromes are more frequently confused than other medi-
cal problems that I discuss in this chapter, I provide a chart (Table 6-1) com-
paring key symptoms of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Treating chronic fatigue syndrome
Although chronic fatigue syndrome currently has no cure, the condition even-
tually appears to improve in most people — but how long it takes to feel
better varies from person to person. In the meantime, physicians can treat
CFS patients with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and low doses of anti-
depressants. Patients with anxiety and sleeplessness may be treated with
anti-anxiety medications such as Klonopin (generic name: clonazepam) or
Ativan (generic name: lorazepam). (Read more about medications in
Chapters 9 and 10.) Some physicians place their patients with CFS on anti-
viral regimens or antibiotics.
Doctors may give patients with CFS lifestyle recommendations, such as
advice on exercising and, if needed, weight loss. Note: Because people with
CFS are easily overtired, they should exercise at a slow rate. Walking and mild
aerobic exercises are usually best for individuals with chronic fatigue syn-
drome. The individual may also benefit from psychological counseling,
because depression or anxiety often accompanies CFS.

Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

Myofascial Pain Syndrome
Another condition that may be confused with fibromyalgia is myofascial pain
syndrome (MFS), which is primarily characterized by regional pain (pain con-
fined to one particular area). This type of pain differs from the widespread
pain characteristic of patients with fibromyalgia. The doctor can also identify
painful areas when he probes them, because they feel like knotted ropes.
Experts say that many cases of MFS have gone undiagnosed, despite the
severity of the case. Yet, this medical problem is usually treatable with medi-
cations and other therapies.
About myofascial pain syndrome
MFS may be caused or worsened by mechanical stress or strain on the mus-
cles, such as from heavy lifting or a physically traumatizing event, or by over-
stressing the muscles of the body in some other manner. Whatever caused
the muscle groups to become stressed, they stay that way and cause pain.
MFS occurs about equally among women and men, in contrast to patients
with fibromyalgia — a medical problem dominated by female patients.
Pain caused by MFS occurs most commonly in the head, shoulders, or lower
back (and usually not in all those places, as is common with fibromyalgia).
Pain from neck muscles can radiate into the skull, although any muscles any-
where in the body can develop trigger points.
80
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 
Considering cortisol
Could cortisol (a hormone released by the
adrenal glands that helps to control blood pres-
sure, blood sugar, and other major body func-
tions) be the key to both the cause of chronic
fatigue syndrome and its solution? Researchers
who performed a study of 32 CFS patients
reported on their findings in the British medical
journal Lancet in 1999. The researchers found
that about one-third of their subjects signifi-
cantly improved upon taking low doses (5 or 10
milligrams per day) of oral hydrocortisone, a
synthetically made form of cortisol, and felt
much more energetic.
The researchers hypothesized that hypocorti-
solism, or a below-normal rate of the cortisol
hormone produced by the adrenal glands, may
have been responsible for the fatigue experi-
enced by the patients. However, hydrocortisone
is an experimental treatment, and further stud-
ies need to be done before hydrocortisone can
be considered an acceptable treatment for
patients who have chronic fatigue syndrome.

Trigger points are areas of pain characteristic of myofascial pain syndrome. A
trigger point is a ropey or nodular muscle area that causes pain that can be
felt in one or more areas of the body by the doctor when she probes the
painful area. They’re very different from the tender points of fibromyalgia.
With fibromyalgia, your painful areas, or tender points, are very sore to the
touch, but the physician doesn’t usually feel anything during your physical
examination, even when directly probing areas that cause you pain. In fact,
the person with FMS feels basically the same to the doctor as a person who
does not have FMS, even in the sore areas. Of course, the pain is there when
you have fibromyalgia, it’s just not related to specific muscle abnormalities.
Several other key features characterize myofascial pain syndrome:
 Regional, rather than widespread, pain: The person with FMS may feel
pain in her neck, shoulders, upper back, lower back, other sites, or all
these areas. The pain may also alternate from one site to another. With
myofascial syndrome, the pain takes up permanent residence in one or
several different hurtful places, and stays there for a long time.
 A limited mobility of motion: With myofascial pain syndrome, you may
have local pain with movements. With FMS, on the other hand, moving
around a lot may hurt, but the pain is usually scattered and widespread.
How myofascial pain syndrome 
differs from fibromyalgia
If someone has told you that myofascial pain syndrome and fibromyalgia are
really the same condition, remember what I’m telling you here: They’re not.
Although FMS and myofascial syndrome have many overlapping features and
you can actually have both medical conditions at the same time, the reality is
that they’re two very different medical problems.
Emotional problems, such as depression and anxiety, occur more frequently
among people with fibromyalgia than among people who have MFS. This
doesn’t mean that patients with MFS are never depressed or anxious. It just
means that they’re less likely to have these emotional problems than are
people with fibromyalgia.
Another difference, as mentioned earlier, is that myofascial pain is usually
more localized than the pain from fibromyalgia, which is widespread.
Even though myofascial syndrome is different from fibromyalgia, it does
share the common denominator of pain. In addition, many people with MFS
also have problems with fatigue and sleep difficulties. However, the fibro fog,
or major difficulty with concentration characteristic of many people who
have fibromyalgia, is found less frequently among patients with MFS.
81
Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

Treating myofascial pain syndrome
Studies indicate that day laborers regularly performing physically demanding
manual work are much less prone to developing trigger points than are indi-
viduals who are basically sedentary and then suddenly engage in physically
demanding tasks. As a result, although exercise and physical activity are gen-
erally good for most people, people who are out of shape and have MFS need
to build up slowly from a sedentary level to a more active level. In fact, this
policy is good for sedentary people without MFS.
Because specific and identifiable trigger points can be found in myofascial
pain syndrome, the condition may be treated with trigger-point injections,
made directly into the painful areas. (These injections often use medications
that can slightly hurt at first, but the pain dissipates quickly, and relief moves
in. Most patients consider the relief worth temporary discomfort.)
Patients with MFS may gain good relief with trigger-point injections, as well
as a variety of medications, such as muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory medications, and painkilling drugs. (I discuss these medica-
tions in Chapters 9 and 10.)
Biofeedback therapy may also be helpful to patients with myofascial pain
syndrome, in that it can help very tense patients receive training in how to
relax overstressed muscles that are causing them such pain. Relaxation ther-
apy may help as well. (Read more about these therapies in Chapter 13.)
Arthritis
Some people with fibromyalgia may be told that they have arthritis — and
the doctor may be right, because arthritis is commonly associated with FMS.
Very generally, arthritis is a disease of the joints and the surrounding tissues.
Arthritis has many different forms, but two primary types are the arthritis
leaders: osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Physicians may sometimes assume that patients have one of these forms of
arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis (because it’s so common), when the pri-
mary problem may be fibromyalgia instead. Also, patients may actually have
osteoarthritis along with fibromyalgia, or may have both rheumatoid arthritis
and fibromyalgia.
There are also less common forms of arthritis which may be associated with
fibromyalgia, such as lupus and polymyalgica rheumatica (pronounced pah-
lee-my-al-jih-kuh roo-mat-ih-kuh). Patients may have one of these disorders
alone or may have one alongside FMS.
82
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

About arthritis
The long-term damage caused by osteoarthritis (and sometimes by rheuma-
toid arthritis as well) can be so severe that the affected person will eventu-
ally require joint replacements, usually of the knee or hip joints.
The key characteristics of arthritis are pain and inflammation, and clinical
tests, such as X-rays, blood tests, or the doctor’s visual observation of appar-
ent swelling and damage of a patient’s joint, usually show some abnormali-
ties. In general, people with fibromyalgia and no arthritis have normal X-rays
and normal blood-test results, and their friends and relatives drive them
crazy by telling them that they look “just fine.”
Boning up on osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is the most prominent form of arthritis: About 21 million
Americans ages 25 and older have osteoarthritis. Before age 45, more men
than women have the disease; after age 45, women pass men in osteoarthritis
incidence.
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative, wear-and-tear disease of the bones.
Although people often think of older people when they think of osteoarthri-
tis, you don’t have to be a senior citizen to be diagnosed with osteoarthritis;
middle-aged or even younger individuals may also be diagnosed with
osteoarthritis.
As people with osteoarthritis age, their pain increases, and their X-rays usu-
ally show increased deterioration. In fact, the damage can become quite
severe, although treatment can often delay the progression of this disease.
Regarding rheumatoid arthritis
The other common form of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflamma-
tory form of arthritis that causes swelling, stiffness, and the eventual deform-
ity and destruction of the joints. About 2.1 million adults in the United States
suffer from this debilitating disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder (a disorder in which the
person’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues as if they were
foreign invaders, like a virus or bacteria). Rheumatoid arthritis causes pain,
inflammation, and damage to the joints. In many people, RA becomes pro-
gressively worse with age.
Severe morning stiffness is a common symptom of RA, as is debilitating joint
pain. Rheumatoid arthritis usually has an onset in patients ages 20 and 45,
although it can develop earlier or later in life. Women have about four times
the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis as men, related to the fact that, in
general, women are more likely to experience autoimmune disorders.
83
Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

Laboratory tests can usually (about 60 percent of the time) detect particular
blood factors that are indicators for the presence or likelihood of rheumatoid
arthritis. In addition, the damage to the person’s joints, which may be
swollen and distorted, may be clearly visible to the physician as well as the
layperson.
In the early stages of the condition, however, the diagnosis of arthritis may
be missed, particularly if the patient was previously diagnosed with
fibromyalgia. And the reverse is true: If the patient was previously diagnosed
with arthritis, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia may be missed.
Looking at lupus
Lupus, also known as systemic lupus erythematosus, is an autoimmune disease
that usually appears in patients in their 20s or 30s. About 90 percent of
people with lupus are female. Lupus is caused by antibodies (produced by
the body) that attack the skin, kidneys, joints, nervous system, and other
parts of the body. It is unknown what triggers these antibodies. If lupus
affects the joints and muscles, causing pain, it may be misdiagnosed as
fibromyalgia.
The most common symptoms of lupus are a red rash on the face, severe
fatigue, painful joints, and swollen glands. The painful joints and extreme
fatigue may generate a diagnosis of FMS if the physician does no further
investigation. For example, people with fibromyalgia are not sensitive to sun-
light, but patients with lupus are photosensitive. In addition, patients with
lupus often have an unexplained fever, not a symptom of fibromyalgia.
Symptoms of lupus come and go; an onset of symptoms is called a flare.
For further information on lupus, contact the national office of the Lupus
Foundation of America, Inc., at 2000 L St. NW, Suite 710, Washington, DC
20036 (phone: 800-558-0121; Web: www.lupus.org).
Pondering polymyalgia rheumatica
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is another disease sometimes confused with
FMS because it causes muscle pain, shoulder and neck pain and stiffness, and
hip pain and stiffness, as well as fatigue. The patient’s pain and stiffness are
particularly severe in the morning. (Often patients with other forms of arthri-
tis are stiff in the morning, so don’t think that you must have PMR if you have
this symptom.)
An estimated 700 of every 100,000 people (less than 1 percent of the popula-
tion) age 50 and older develop PMR. The disease nearly always develops sud-
denly in people age 50 and older, and older women are about twice as likely
to develop PMR as men. The person with PMR has an elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) in their blood test for inflammation, but other tests
are normal. Anemia may be present, as well as unintentional weight loss. The
symptoms usually decline within one to four years. People with PMR are
treated with medications for their pain and stiffness.
84
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

It is unknown what causes PMR, although some experts theorize that it may
be triggered by infection, because the symptoms occur so suddenly. If PMR is
caused by an infection, the bacteria or virus has not been isolated to date.
Women have about twice the risk of men of developing PMR. The diagnosis
and treatment of PMR is important because about 15 percent of those with
PMR develop giant-cell arteritis, a more severe disease which may cause
blindness and stroke. Giant-cell arteritis causes arteries in the head, neck,
and arms to narrow and reduce blood flow.
How arthritis differs from fibromyalgia
How can osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, the most common forms of
arthritis, possibly be confused with fibromyalgia? This confusion can occur
in two primary cases:
 The osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis may be an early case, and
damage is not yet detectable in lab work or X-rays. In the early stages
of arthritis, the disease causes pain, muscle stiffness, overall achiness,
and fatigue. Patients may also experience depression and anxiety, as
they also do with fibromyalgia. The doctor may assume that if the
patient’s symptoms sound like arthritis, it must be arthritis.
 Many people with fibromyalgia have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid
arthritis (or less commonly, lupus or PMR), because arthritis is a
common medical problem. As a result, the diagnosis of arthritis may be
correctly flagged by the physician, but the identification of fibromyalgia
may be altogether missed.
What if a person has only fibromyalgia? Can she be misdiagnosed with arthri-
tis? Yes, this can happen, primarily when the mistaken diagnosis is osteo-
arthritis, primarily because osteoarthritis is so commonly found. Even if no
extensive damage can be found in X-rays, physicians may assume that the
person is suffering from a “touch” of arthritis, which usually means that the
patient has indications of early osteoarthritis. But the correct diagnosis may
be fibromyalgia instead.
Treating arthritis
If you’re diagnosed with arthritis, your doctor should be able to help you
improve how you feel. However, keep in mind that, as with fibromyalgia,
arthritis is a chronic disease, and no magic pills are out there that can eradi-
cate it forever.
85
Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

Whether you have rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, lupus, or PMR, the
key elements of help are medication, exercises to improve your stiffness and
your range of motion, and basic lifestyle changes, such as weight loss (when
needed) and a nutritious diet. Physical therapy may also provide some relief.
For more on coping with arthritis, check out Arthritis For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Barry Fox, Nadine Taylor, and Jinoos Yazdany (Wiley).
Medicating arthritis
People with osteoarthritis generally need medications in a class known as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These medications reduce
pain that stems from inflammation. As the name stipulates, they aren’t
steroid drugs. NSAIDs are available in both over-the-counter and prescribed
strengths. Their primary side effect is to cause stomach upset, and their con-
tinued use may cause stomach ulcers.
Although most anti-inflammatory drugs and mild painkillers provide pain
relief to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, most patients need to take disease-
modifying antirheumatic (DMARD) drugs, such as methotrexate sulfasalazine
or hydroxychloroquine. Doctors may suggest prescribing a DMARD drug early
in the course of the disease because these drugs can prevent serious joint
damage.
Newer drugs for rheumatoid arthritis include Enbrel (generic name: etaner-
cept), Humira (generic name: adalimumab), and Remicade (generic name:
inflixamab), all drugs that work to block inflammation. Patients may also be
given drugs in the COX-2 inhibitor class to block inflammation and pain, such
as Celebrex (generic name: celecoxib). Other newer therapies include medi-
cations such as Orencia (generic name: abatacept) and Rituxan (generic
name: rituximab).
The treatment for patients with lupus is tailored to their problem. If the
patient is in remission, aspirin may be sufficient. If the patient is suffering
from a flare, she may need painkillers as well as anti-malaria drugs such as
Plaquinil (generic name: hydroxychloroquine) and steroids.
What about PMR? Patients with PMR are given steroids such as a low daily
dose of prednisone. The prednisone is reduced as symptoms go away.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin may be
taken daily. Prednisone can cause weight gain, fluid retention, easy bruising,
and a round face. It may also lead to diabetes, glaucoma, and stomach irrita-
tion. Patients with PMR need to be followed carefully by their doctors.
Considering other needed treatments
The patient with rheumatoid arthritis may also need to “rest” a joint, with
splints or braces. Some patients in the later stages of rheumatoid arthritis
may be so impaired that they may require a walker in order to move about.
86
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

People with the forms of arthritis discussed in this chapter can gain consider-
able benefit from cold or heat therapy or massage therapy (as described in
Chapter 11), as well as relaxation therapy (covered in Chapter 13). Aquatic
exercises and swimming may improve problems with physical mobility and
pain. (Read more about how exercise can help fibromyalgia symptoms in
Chapter 15.) They may also benefit from massage therapy and acupuncture.
(Read about massage therapy in Chapter 11 and acupuncture in Chapter 12.)
Low doses of antidepressants, described in Chapter 10, may decrease pain
and improve sleep among those with sleep problems.
These are all therapies, which, coincidentally, also benefit people with FMS.
As a result, if you happen to have the dubious honor of having both arthritis
and fibromyalgia, such therapies can help you to improve both conditions.
Thyroid Disease
Now, arthritis and fibromyalgia seem to go together quite well. But how could
anyone possibly confuse thyroid disease with fibromyalgia? One is an
endocrine disorder, and the other is a musculoskeletal problem — two seem-
ingly disparate medical issues.
The key reason why thyroid disease can be easily confused with fibromyalgia
is that hypothyroidism, or low thyroid function, leads to fatigue and may cause
painful and aching muscles and even widespread pain — the symptoms ex-
perienced by most people with fibromyalgia. Hypothyroidism is common, yet
is often undetected. However, testing for low thyroid isn’t difficult.
If you think that you may have fibromyalgia, ask your doctor for a thyroid-
function blood test. If you have an underactive thyroid, a small thyroid pill
taken once a day usually rectifies the problem.
About hypothyroidism (low thyroid)
The thyroid gland is an important organ located in your neck. It produces
thyroid hormone, a hormone needed for survival. This hormone controls a
person’s basic energy level and affects many aspects of the body, such as
blood pressure, heart rate, and even fertility and mood states. People need
thyroid hormone to live, whether it’s derived from their own thyroid gland or
from thyroid-supplement medications that they take.
Sometimes, people develop thyroid problems that cause low or high levels of
thyroid hormone to circulate in the body, and this malfunction directly
affects the individual. Thyroid disease is almost always treatable, although
people with thyroid problems should consult an endocrinologist, a physician
who specializes in endocrine diseases like thyroid disorders.
87
Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

When someone has a thyroid disease that doctors may confuse with
fibromyalgia, it’s nearly always hypothyroidism because symptoms more
commonly associated with low levels of thyroid, such as low energy, fatigue,
and body aches and pains, are also symptoms of fibromyalgia.
The specific screening test for thyroid disorders is the thyroid-stimulating hor-
mone (TSH). If your thyroid gland isn’t producing enough thyroid hormone to
meet your needs, your pituitary gland will react and raise the level of TSH in
your blood. A repeat TSH test is usually done to confirm hypothyroidism
before medication is started. There are other thyroid tests, but most doctors
consider the TSH the gold standard of thyroid tests. If you have a thyroid dis-
ease, you’ll need periodic blood testing to ensure that your medication is at
the right level.
Treating thyroid disease
Hypothyroidism is readily treatable by experienced physicians. Thyroid dis-
ease is best treated by endocrinologists, physicians expert in treating thyroid
diseases and other medical problems related to the endocrine system.
Hypothyroidism is treated with prescribed synthetic or natural thyroid hor-
mone, available at virtually any pharmacy. The medication is usually taken
once daily, and is best taken on an empty stomach for full potency.
When thyroid disease is first diagnosed and treatment has begun, the TSH is
usually repeated several times the first year of treatment, to ensure that the
person doesn’t need a higher or a lower dosage. After apparent stabilization,
TSH testing may be limited to an annual test, if the doctor decides that’s suffi-
cient. If thyroid medication is taken during pregnancy or menopause, a
woman may require a change in the dosage of the drug.
For more on treating thyroid disease, check out Thyroid For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Alan L. Rubin, MD (Wiley).
The Other Suspects
In addition to the diseases and medical conditions that I discuss earlier in
this chapter, the specific medical problem that causes pain, fatigue, and other
symptoms characteristic of fibromyalgia may be caused by another underly-
ing disease or condition.
There are too many possibilities to name them all here, but several are worth
discussing, including Lyme disease, Raynaud’s phenomenon, various medical
conditions that cause back pain, and infectious mononucleosis.
88
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

Being ticked off by Lyme disease
Lyme disease is an infection caused by an organism with a tongue twister
name: Borrelia burgdorferi. It’s spread by tiny, dot-like ticks that typically feed
off animals but aren’t opposed to a human treat. If they latch onto you, you
could get the disease.
Lyme disease was originally believed confined to the northeastern United
States and was first identified in Lyme, Connecticut. However, subsequent
clusters of Lyme disease were identified in most states, as well as in France,
Germany, and Switzerland, and other countries worldwide.
Lyme disease can be cured if treated early on, but if the disease goes undiag-
nosed for months or longer, then it usually becomes a chronic illness.
You don’t need an up-close and personal encounter with an animal in the
forest in order to be afflicted by Lyme disease. You can become a tick’s host if
you walk in deep grass or interact a lot with your pets that go outside. What
if you never saw any ticks on your body? Does that mean that you’re safe
from Lyme disease? No, it doesn’t. Experts say that most patients who tested
positive for Lyme never recall seeing a tick on themselves.
Some symptoms of Lyme disease may resemble those of fibromyalgia, such
as widespread joint pain, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and so forth. Flu-
like symptoms occur in the first stage of Lyme disease, and a characteristic
rash typically occurs. The symptoms generally escalate weeks or even
months later to musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, and swelling. These symp-
toms may be clinically confused with fibromyalgia or with osteoarthritis.
As with the other medical problems described in this chapter, patients can
have both FMS and Lyme disease. However, unlike with rheumatoid arthritis
or fibromyalgia, the arthritis of Lyme disease is usually limited to one joint,
most often the knee, and it is difficult to overlook.
One laboratory indicator of possible Lyme disease is an elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), a blood test for inflammation. Doctors may suspect
that Lyme disease is present, based on your symptoms and the ESR, but the
illness can only be confirmed with further testing that the doctor orders.
In most cases, doctors order a blood test called a Lyme titer, a special test
that checks for Lyme disease. If this test is positive, other confirming tests
are also often ordered. The Lyme titer does have some false negatives, espe-
cially if the person just contracted the disease, but false negatives aren’t
common.
Making sure that people actually have Lyme disease before treatment is initi-
ated is important because treatment can be long and costly, particularly
when the disease is identified in the late stages. In the early stages, patients
89
Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

may be treated with oral antibiotics for two to three weeks. However, if the
disease has progressed to a later stage, patients must take antibiotics intra-
venously for at least several weeks — possibly for several months.
Reflecting on Raynaud’s phenomenon
Raynaud’s phenomenon is also associated with FMS. Raynaud’s phenomenon,
present in about 3 percent of the population, primarily affects the fingers and
toes, causing them to hyper-react to cold temperatures, become pale, throb,
and tingle. (No bare feet for anyone with Raynaud’s!) Raynaud’s phenomenon
is associated with increased sympathetic tone, which may cause or con-
tribute to fibromyalgia pain. Often Raynaud’s phenomenon is diagnosed,
while the FMS is not.
Most people with Raynaud’s complain of cold hands and feet but rarely
develop skin ulcers in their toes and fingers. Occasionally other parts of the
body are affected, such as the nose, ears, and lips.
Raynaud’s has a genetic link, but may also be caused or worsened by chronic
stress. Chemotherapy for cancer may induce Raynaud’s, as may some drugs
for high blood pressure (beta blockers) or migraine headaches (drugs with
ergotamine). In addition, even over-the-counter cold medications may cause
Raynaud’s. The autonomic nervous system (which controls heart rate and
breathing) plays a major role in Raynaud’s. Tests for autonomic dysfunction
include heart rate and blood pressure measurements as well as tilt table test-
ing (lying on a table flat or upright). Simple methods like biofeedback and
stress reduction can often calm an overactive autonomic nervous system.
Tests such as a cold challenge are used to detect Raynaud’s phenomenon.
With this test, the physician may put your hands into cold water for a few
seconds. If this manipulation causes your fingers to turn blue or white, you
may suffer from Raynaud’s phenomenon.
People with Raynaud’s should avoid the cold and should wear socks. (If it’s
very cold, several pairs of socks may be needed.) They should also wear a
hat in cold weather so body heat is maintained. They should also avoid
smoking and caffeine, both of which make blood vessels constrict, and they
should be careful around air-conditioning, which can aggravate the condition.
(Don’t sit next to or directly under an air-conditioning vent.)
Some medications that help people with Raynaud’s disease are Procardia
(generic name: nifedipine) and Norvasc (generic name: amlodipine). Both of
these drugs are calcium-channel blockers, which relax the smooth muscle
and help to enlarge small blood vessels. Some patients also improve with
Minipres (generic name: prazosin) or Cardura (generic name: doxazosin),
both high-blood-pressure medications that are alpha-receptor blockers.

Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

Evaluating other possibilities
Your doctor may consider a variety of other ailments when trying to make a
diagnosis when pain is present. Ailments that cause low-back pain are one
possibility. Other far less common medical problems are multiple chemical
sensitivities syndrome and infectious mononucleosis.
Low-back pain
The majority of all adults experience pain in their lower backs at some time
in their lives. If the pain is chronic, it may indicate some minor or moderate
damage to the spine. The underlying problem causing your symptoms may
be arthritis. Or it could be a disk problem, infection, or something else. The
causes of low-back pain are numerous.
Low-back pain may indicate fibromyalgia, particularly if other symptoms are
present, such as pain in other parts of the body, fatigue, and sleep difficulties.
When patients complain primarily of low-back pain, doctors try to determine
if a recent injury, such as a fall or car crash, occurred. If not, they try to
determine other possible causes, such as a kidney infection, bladder infec-
tion, or another internal problem.
Physicians usually order a complete blood count and a urinalysis to detect
bacteria or blood in case the underlying problem is a kidney or a urinary
tract infection. They may also order spinal X-rays to help determine if the
pain is coming from damage to the spinal cord or from arthritis. However, it
is important to know that spinal X-ray changes correlate poorly with your
degree of back pain. This means that you may have only minimal changes on
your spinal X-ray but major pain, whereas some people with lots of spinal
arthritis have no pain at all!
If low-back pain has continued without any relief for weeks or months and the
physician suspects a serious problem (or wants to rule one out), he may
order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. An MRI is an expensive spe-
cial test that is noninvasive and provides many details of bones, muscles, tis-
sues, and internal organs. If you have normal laboratory tests, normal X-rays,
and, if ordered, a normal MRI, then the problem may be fibromyalgia.
Multiple chemical sensitivities syndrome
A very controversial diagnosis, multiple chemical sensitivities syndrome
(MCSS) means that the patient has seemingly become extremely sensitive to
many different substances that never bothered him before, such as numerous
odors, foods, and other common items found in most environments.
Items like perfumes, household detergents, and cigarette smoke can induce
severe symptoms, such as migraine headaches, insomnia, joint pain, and
mental confusion. These symptoms also can occur in someone with FMS.
91
Chapter 6: Identifying Diseases Often Confused with Fibromyalgia

This syndrome is sometimes confused with the “boy in the bubble” situation,
a very unique situation in which a child had virtually no immune system and
lived confined in a bacteria-free environment because any germs would’ve
killed him. But people with MCSS still have working immune systems, even
though it may seem that everything bothers them and causes symptoms.
Pinpointing the causes of what’s aggravating their fatigue and pain and other
symptoms can be a challenge for the patient and doctor. No current blood
tests or other laboratory measures screen for multiple chemical sensitivities
syndrome; consequently, this diagnosis is generally made based on the physi-
cian’s observations — long after other possible causes are ruled out.
Infectious mononucleosis
Can adults contact infectious mononucleosis, a virus once known as the “kiss-
ing disease”? Yes, people of any age can contract mononucleosis, the infec-
tion obtained through the Epstein-Barr virus. But remember, most people
have been exposed to Epstein-Barr during childhood, and this virus remains
with you for life.
The basic symptoms of mono are fatigue and flu-like aches and pains, symp-
toms also found in fibromyalgia. However, unlike fibromyalgia, the person
with mononucleosis often has a sore throat and swollen glands. Fortunately,
mononucleosis does eventually go away, with rest and treatment. (Although
people can contract mononucleosis more than once.)
The illness is easily screened for with a blood test. If the test is negative, the
person usually doesn’t have mononucleosis.
If a patient doesn’t improve with time, the doctor should consider the possi-
bility that the underlying problem may be fibromyalgia or other medical
problems.

inda saw an internist, a family practitioner, and two rheumatologists
before she was finally diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Sam says that he saw
five different doctors. He’s forgotten what all their specialties were, but it
wasn’t until he saw a pain-management expert that he was finally diagnosed
with fibromyalgia. Amy was lucky compared to most people who are ulti-
mately diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS): She hit the jackpot on
her second try and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about eight months after
the first symptoms hit her hard.
Linda, Sam, and Amy all really needed a good doctor, but connecting with one
took considerable time. In fact, some people with fibromyalgia are probably
never diagnosed or are misdiagnosed for years. Why does this happen? One
reason is that a lot of doctors still don’t understand fibromyalgia, while some
continue to believe (wrongly) that FMS is a meaningless diagnosis for people
with imagined symptoms. Yet you really need a good, caring, and knowledge-
able doctor to help you cope with the pain, fatigue, and other troubling symp-
toms that fibromyalgia causes.
This chapter is about working with your primary-care physician, and it’s also
about finding another doctor or locating a specialist if you need one. A key
point to keep in mind is that you need a doctor who’s familiar with the diagno-
sis and treatment of musculoskeletal pain syndromes like FMS. Many primary-
care physicians have experience with FMS, but, sometimes, a specialist like a
rheumatologist or a neurologist is required to make the diagnosis.

94
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 
Working with Your Primary-Care Doctor
In many cases, your “regular” physician can readily diagnose and treat your
fibromyalgia, and you won’t need to see any other doctors to receive spe-
cialty knowledge or instructions. Over the last several years, most physicians
have begun to realize and accept that FMS is a valid diagnosis (although
some skeptical doctors and also some total nonbelievers are still out there).
Sometimes, however, your primary-care doctor may need to look up a few
things about fibromyalgia, and he may also want to consult with colleagues
for their opinions. If so, that’s understandable and okay. You may also need a
referral to see a specialist, such as a rheumatologist or another type of physi-
cian who has more expertise in treating FMS than your primary-care doctor
possesses.
Ideally, your doctor already knows about fibromyalgia, is treating other
patients who have FMS, and is seeing some improvements in them. I’ll call
this physician “Dr. Wonderful.” Dr. W. is also aware of the many other ail-
ments that are often associated with FMS. (Read Chapter 2 for a complete dis-
cussion of the other medical problems that often accompany fibromyalgia.)
In addition to this basic knowledge about fibromyalgia, Dr. W. is also aware of
the medications and treatments that usually work best for people with
fibromyalgia. (Check out Chapters 9 and 10 for info on FMS-related medica-
tions and Chapter 11 for hands-on treatment options.) At the same time, Dr. W.
is careful to avoid taking a one-size-fits-all approach because FMS symptoms
vary from person to person. Dr. Wonderful is also open to new ideas regarding
treatment while retaining a healthy skepticism about new treatments. (I dis-
cuss alternative remedies and treatments in Chapter 12.) You’re consulting
with Dr. W. not only for medical expertise but also for good judgment.
Unfortunately, finding out that your doctor has little experience with FMS is a
common problem. Your primary-care physician may be great for just about
everything that ails you. But for some reason, fibromyalgia has her thrown
for a loop. Introducing Dr. Good Enough. If your doctor isn’t Dr. Wonderful,
you’d rather have Dr. Good Enough than Dr. Awful. Dr. Good Enough may
work well for you, if she’s open-minded, caring, and willing to listen and learn.
Is every doctor like Dr. Wonderful (or even Dr. Good Enough)? Sadly, the
answer is no. Therefore, I must introduce you to Dr. Awful. Dr. Awful is the
kind of person who doesn’t know much about FMS and won’t take the time
necessary to get to know you and treat your symptoms.
Some doctors continue to see FMS as a nebulous medical problem. Those
doctors haven’t caught up on the latest scientific data about fibromyalgia.
Because they can’t see a specific clinical abnormality or result on a lab test

or an X-ray, or in some other quantifiable test, they may have trouble making
the diagnosis of FMS. They may send off people who suffer from symptoms of
chronic pain and fatigue (but who have normal lab results) for psychological
counseling only, and they won’t prescribe the important comprehensive ther-
apy that’s necessary to treat FMS.
Janet is a physician who suffers from fibromyalgia. She says that when she
went to medical school, she was taught that fibromyalgia was a problem of
neurotic women who constantly felt like they had the flu. Janet isn’t sur-
prised, although she’s still dismayed, that some people with symptoms of
fibromyalgia are sent to mental-health professionals to be treated for a psy-
chiatric disorder when their primary-care doctors receive lab reports that
are all marked “within the normal range.” If a laboratory finding doesn’t come
up positive, then such doctors believe that the patient must be imagining the
symptoms, according to this mindset.
Janet is right. Patients need to stand up and speak out that musculoskeletal
pain can be a very real problem. It isn’t something that you invent to get
more attention or make the people in your life feel sorry for poor you. FMS
sufferers know that they can get attention in plenty of other ways, and they
also know that most people do not feel sorry for those with FMS. Neither
Janet nor the overwhelming majority of the other estimated 6 million people
with fibromyalgia are malingerers or hypochondriacs.

Looking Elsewhere for a Doctor: 
How to Know if It’s Time
If you’ve tried to work with your doctor and you feel like you’re just not get-
ting anywhere, and if your pain, fatigue, and other symptoms continue to be
moderate to severe or maybe they’re getting worse, you may want to con-
sider working with another physician. It may be the only way for you to get
the help that you need.
You have to make your own individual decision about when to seek another
medical opinion. But here are some basic points for you to keep in mind
before you decide to switch to, or even consult with, another doctor:
 Have you given your current doctor enough time to evaluate you and
treat you? For example, if you saw the doctor just last week and told
him about your problem for the first time, and now you’re angry
because the first medication didn’t work, now’s probably too soon to
give up on the doctor. In most cases, you should give your physician
more time to help you resolve your problem. However, if you’ve been
working with this doctor for months and you don’t feel any better at all,
it may be time for a change.
 Do you feel that the doctor is taking your problems seriously? If the
doctor hasn’t paid enough attention to your symptoms (or you) or has
told you that all you need to do is lose weight, exercise, cheer up, or
some other overly simplistic answer, you probably need to think about
finding another doctor. These solutions could help you, but they rarely
work alone. Instead, most people with fibromyalgia need medications
and other treatments.
96
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

 Are your doctor’s recommendations making you feel worse instead of
better or about the same? If the doctor prescribes medications or treat-
ments that exacerbate your condition, you may actually end up feeling
worse than you did before. For example, if the doctor recommends vig-
orous physical therapy and exercise, you need to tell her if you’ve tried
this approach in the past and it has worsened your pain. People with
FMS are very pain sensitive, so they need to exercise at a slower and
less intense pace than others who don’t have fibromyalgia. (Read more
about exercise in Chapter 15.)
Sometimes, sheer persistence may be needed before you identify a doctor
who can diagnose and treat your fibromyalgia, although I hope you won’t
have as much trouble as Joan did. Because of severe stiffness in her neck and
shoulders, which seemed to appear around the time she was diagnosed with
strep throat, Joan had asked her internist for help with all her symptoms, but
he couldn’t find anything wrong, other than the strep infection.
Joan changed doctors many times because she felt that they weren’t taking
her medical problem seriously. In fact, she says that she saw 22 doctors over
18 months until, at long last, she found a rheumatologist who diagnosed her
with FMS and treated her. Joan says that the other doctors had told her that
her condition was caused by the four pregnancies she’d had and by the onset
of menopause. She says she was angry that the doctors didn’t listen to her or
believe her, but she’s very happy that she’s found a good doctor now. Joan is
glad that she didn’t decide to just settle for one of the other doctors. Follow
Joan’s example: Don’t settle.
Considering Types of Specialists
If your primary-care doctor can’t or won’t treat fibromyalgia or wants you to
seek the help of a specialist, not to worry! A variety of specialists treat people
with fibromyalgia. In this section, I introduce you to the ones most likely to
help you. (Note: Internists and family practitioners treat FMS, too, but they’re
generally not regarded as specialists.)
The Fibromyalgia Network is an organization that recommends physicians 
in the United States and Canada to its members. To find out how to join, con-
tact the organization at P.O. Box 31750, Tucson, AZ 85751 (phone: 800-853-2929;

Chapter 7: Working with a Good Fibromyalgia Doc: You Need a True Believer

Regarding rheumatologists
A rheumatologist is an internist (a person who specializes in diseases of the
internal system) who further specializes in treating arthritis and diseases of
the joints, muscles, and soft tissues. Rheumatologists are most prominently
at the forefront of FMS treatment and probably have the most knowledge and
information about the syndrome. (However, do not assume that all rheumatol-
ogists are automatically up to date on fibromyalgia. They’re not.) A rheuma-
tologist should be able to diagnose and treat you effectively with
recommended treatments and medications. He should also be able to give
you good advice on lifestyle changes that are tailored to your personal needs
and that can make you feel better.
Nerving up about neurologists
Neurologists are doctors who specialize in diseases of the brain and nervous
system. Because most people with fibromyalgia suffer from severe pain, at
some point in their search for a diagnosis, many patients do eventually consult
with a neurologist. Many, but not all, neurologists are familiar with fibromyalgia
and how it should be diagnosed and treated. Because neurologists are inter-
ested in the brain and spinal cord, they’re usually aware of problems with pain
and the available array of medications to treat pain — as well as with other
therapies and lifestyle changes that could help you.
Considering pain-management experts
Some doctors specialize in treating all forms of pain and start their own pain-
management clinics. Often, these doctors are neurologists or anesthesiolo-
gists, although doctors of any specialty may start their own pain clinic.
Pain-management doctors may specialize in certain types of pain, such as the
severe pain of cancer or other medical problems that are far more readily
diagnosed than fibromyalgia. A pain-management clinic may or may not treat
a person who has fibromyalgia — the situation varies. Some clinics have told
patients that fibromyalgia is “too hard” for them to treat, and they won’t
accept people with fibromyalgia as patients; others have helped FMS patients
a great deal.
Pondering other physician specialists
A physiatrist (not a psychiatrist, even though the spelling looks very close!),
commonly known as a sports-medicine doctor, is a type of doctor who’s
familiar with the pros and cons of exercise and physical therapy and who
98
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

treats injuries that can stem from sports accidents. Sometimes, fibromyalgia
results from a physical trauma, such as an athletic accident or a car crash,
and physiatrists can help people work on their own rehabilitation.
Orthopedic surgeons also sometimes treat fibromyalgia. They’re knowledge-
able about broken bones, sprained ligaments, and muscle injuries, and they
can help you create a program of recovery. Of course, whatever specialty the
doctor has trained in, she needs to be aware of the problems associated with
fibromyalgia in particular.
Finding a Good Specialist or 
a New Primary-Care Doctor
If you decide that you want to consult with a specialist, where do you start in
your search for a smart and knowledgeable doctor who can help you allevi-
ate at least some of the pain and strain of fibromyalgia? Here are some basic
suggestions, which should help you find a new specialist. If you need to
change your primary-care doctor, these guidelines may assist you, too.
Looking at doctors within 
your insurance network
Although it’s not popular to say anything good about health-insurance com-
panies, some of them have thoroughly checked out the doctors that they
cover. They often check out malpractice claims, financial records, the doc-
tors’ education, and many other aspects of the physicians. They have access
to information that’s unavailable to most people. Insurance companies don’t
want to work with doctors who are lawsuit magnets, so they try to screen out
these doctors. This is good for patients.
However, some insurance companies merely seek to sign up the doctors who
are willing to take a lower payment rate than they would normally accept in
order to be in the insurance network. For this reason, sometimes the very
best doctors aren’t in your particular group or in your health-insurance com-
pany’s network. As a result, doctors who are out of network shouldn’t be
regarded as inherently risky or bad. Of course, when you’re seeking a new
primary-care doctor or specialist, start within your insurance company’s 
network. (Be sure to read more about effective ways of dealing with health-
insurance companies in Chapter 17.)
If you go out of network, you may have to pay a higher percentage of the
cost, depending on your health-insurance company’s policy.
99
Chapter 7: Working with a Good Fibromyalgia Doc: You Need a True Believer

Asking your own doctors whom they’d 
see or send a family member to
You’ve decided that you need to see a specialist for your fibromyalgia, but
you have no idea whom you’d like to see, so you ask your primary physician
to give you a referral. Your primary physician may have dealt personally with
a particular specialist before, but don’t assume so. Some physicians simply
refer their patients to a specialist whom they’ve heard about through col-
leagues or to a specialist who happens to be in the same medical group. You
may want to ask your doctor about this specialist and why he’s referring you
to this particular doctor.
When looking for a new specialist or primary-care doctor, talk to all your doc-
tors (your pediatrician, gynecologist, urologist, or other docs you know).
Don’t restrict yourself to solely asking your internist or family practitioner for
a recommendation. Asking different doctors can help to broaden the scope of
your search. You may also consider asking other professionals, such as your
dentist, whom they would recommend for a chronic-pain problem.
Your doctors’ recommendations for other doctors will help you narrow the
field. But before you get the recommendations, be sure to provide some basic
important information to your doctors about what you need and want, in
order to help them further gauge whom to recommend. Ask yourself the fol-
lowing questions and then give the answers to the doctors whose recommen-
dations you seek:
 How far are you willing to travel to see this doctor? A 20-mile radius? A
50-mile radius? The farther you can go, the greater the pool of doctors to
choose from.
 How long are you willing to wait for an appointment? Some doctors may
be booked for months in advance. However, they may be worth the wait.
 Do you have any special requirements or other needs? For example,
do you only want to see a female or male doctor? Do you prefer a doctor
of a specific ethnicity? The pickier you are, the fewer choices of doctors
you’ll have.
 Must the doctor be on your insurance company’s list of approved doc-
tors, or are you willing to pay extra to see an out-of-network physician?
Paying extra bucks may be worth it if the new doctor helps you.
In asking your doctors to recommend a specialist, consider asking them the
following questions:
 What physician would you go to see if you had this problem? Most
doctors have been asked this question before, but it may still make them
stop and think.
100
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

 Would you send your partner, parent, or child to see this doctor? This
question is similar to the first one, but it’s still a good question to ask
because it’ll also make most doctors stop and think.
 Have you met this doctor in person or ever talked to this doctor at
length? Ideally, your doctor has met and talked to the doctor that’s
being recommended. If not, at least you’ll know.
 What is it about this doctor that most impresses you? Listen carefully
to the answer and see if it makes sense to you.
Contacting friends and relatives
Many people with fibromyalgia have friends and relatives who also have FMS
or are suffering from the apparent symptoms of fibromyalgia. So ask your
friends and family members if they know of any doctors who’ve been effec-
tive in treating their fibromyalgia or FMS suffered by others they know.
Keep in mind the basic pros and cons of asking family members for help.
Here are some pros:
 They may know many doctors who could help.
 They may be able to help you get an appointment faster.
 They may have other ideas on how you can feel better.
And here are some cons:
 Relatives or friends may try to convince you that you’re not really sick.
 They may be annoyed if you don’t see the doctor they like.
 They may tell everyone else in the family about your problem, and you
could get a lot of unwanted advice.
Check out Chapter 18 for more information on working with your family when
you have FMS.
Checking with major medical 
centers and universities
If you live near a major medical center or in a city with a medical school, in
most cases, the doctors there are more likely to be up on the latest diagnoses
and treatments. They’re also more likely to be well informed on fibromyalgia
as a pain disorder. This doesn’t mean that if you live in the town of Almost
Nowhere, your country doctor can’t or won’t help you — it’s just less likely.
101
Chapter 7: Working with a Good Fibromyalgia Doc: You Need a True Believer

Interviewing Your Physician Candidate:
What’s Up, Doc?
Imagining yourself interviewing a doctor to see whether she is right for you
can be a pretty scary and daunting thought. Who are you, after all, to be
interviewing a smart medical doctor? I’ll tell you who you are: a person who
needs help and who should find the best doctor you can.
Keep in mind that the United States has thousands of doctors with many dif-
ferent types of medical interests and levels of expertise. What you need is a
good match between you and your problems and the doctor who will help
you to improve your health.
When you’re thinking about working with a particular doctor, you should defi-
nitely consider making an appointment to ask him specific questions, even if
you have to pay for the appointment. One meeting with the doctor should help
you to screen the physician to determine whether he may be able to help you.
Here are a few questions to ask prospective physicians. (I also include a few
basic guidelines for you to use in evaluating the doctor’s answer to each
question.)
 Is fibromyalgia a prevalent chronic-pain syndrome? If you get a no or a
convoluted and confusing response, this doctor probably isn’t the right
one for you. If the doctor says yes, that fibromyalgia is common, but she
adds that she can’t be sure that you have FMS, that’s an okay and normal
answer. The physician is right that she needs to be able to examine you,
take a medical history, and rule out other diseases before coming up with
a diagnosis. (Read more about this process in Chapter 8.)
 Doctor, are you familiar with diagnosing and treating fibromyalgia
patients? If so, about how many patients with FMS have you treated? If
it’s only one, then don’t expect a lot of experience from this doctor.
However, many docs are willing to learn about fibromyalgia, so if the
doctor admits not knowing much but says he’ll investigate further, he may
be a “keeper.” However, if the doctor says that FMS isn’t real, move on!
 Do your patients with fibromyalgia improve with treatment? The
answer in most cases should be a guarded yes, although most physi-
cians know that they don’t have any magical cures or talismans to offer
people with fibromyalgia. If the doctor’s answer is no, that most FMS
patients have no hope of improvement, what’s the point of spending any
time or money with this doctor? You’d better keep looking.
102
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

 Do you think that you can cure me if I have fibromyalgia? If you ask
the doctor whether he thinks that you can be cured forever of your
fibromyalgia and the answer is an unequivocal yes, be very careful about
signing up with this doc. Although some physicians may believe that
they have the one true answer to the problem, most doctors instead see
fibromyalgia as a chronic disease that has its ups and downs.
 How long do you think it may take for treatments or medications to
make me feel better? When you ask this question, most doctors will
honestly say that they don’t know. If the doctor says that you’ll be com-
pletely cured in just a few weeks or a month, be very dubious about
receiving your medical treatment from this person.
Of course, your doctor may be able to help you quickly alleviate some of
your most severe symptoms, particularly the pain and fatigue, with
medications or treatments that you may not have tried before. The key
is to retain a healthy skepticism and avoid seeking quick fixes.
You’re the only one who knows whether this physician has gained your confi-
dence. If you don’t feel comfortable with a particular physician, find someone
who is more compassionate and skillful. Finding the right doctor for you may
take some time, but it’s definitely worth the search.

Chapter 7: Working with a Good Fibromyalgia Doc: You Need a True Believer
“Doctor shopping” and fibromyalgia
Sometimes, when you see many doctors over a
short period of time, you may get the reputation
of doctor shopping, or looking for a physician
who’ll give you the answer (or the drug) that you
seek. When it comes to people with fibromyalgia,
it’ s hard not to appear as if you’re doctor shop-
ping when you have to deal with the lack of
knowledge that some doctors have about FMS.
As a result, when you see a new doctor for the
first time, it’s probably a good idea to be very
blunt and tell her that you’re not doctor shop-
ping, but you’re looking for someone who can
help you feel better. You should avoid proclaim-
ing that nearly every doctor you’ve ever seen
before this time was an idiot or incompetent or
a monster (even if they were!). Instead, simply
say that your previous doctors were unable to
help you, for whatever reason. Most doctors
can understand and accept that rationale.

M
any people with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) report that they’ve seen
numerous doctors, and obtaining a diagnosis of their illness has taken
a year or more. Knowledge is power, and some self-education on the basics 
of the diagnostic process can help you to help your doctor. Armed with this
information, you may be able to shorten the time to reach your diagnosis and
treatment.
This chapter tells you about the information-gathering and decision-making
process that doctors go through to decide what’s wrong with you. You can
also find tips on how to talk to your doctor about your symptoms and on
how to know when to speak up for yourself. I also cover what tests doctors
often use to help them with their diagnosis. In general, laboratory tests and
other analyses, such as scans, are negative for people with FMS (meaning
that nothing shows up); doctors use the tests to rule out that another condi-
tion or disease is causing the symptom.

Diving into Your Medical History: 
What the Doctor Should Ask You
Most doctors agree that an integral part of an examination for any new
patient is the careful taking of a medical history. Medical histories usually
involve your past and current medical problems as well as any surgeries that
you may have had and medications that you currently take. If you’re a new
patient, you’ll nearly always be given a form to fill out regarding this informa-
tion, or the doctor or a nurse will ask you the questions directly. In fact, even
if you’ve seen the doctor before, it’s still a good idea for the physician to per-
form (or have the nurse perform) at least a quick review of your medical his-
tory. Doctors can use this information to check for patterns or clues to help
them with your current diagnosis.
You can’t possibly know exactly what your physician needs to know to diag-
nose you. So, instead of trying to screen your answers, just answer all the
questions that your doctor asks you honestly, even if these questions don’t
seem relevant to you, and leave it up to the physician to figure out how to
use the information. Provide complete and accurate answers. Something that
may seem unimportant to you, such as an operation you had ten years ago,
could be relevant to the doctor.
If you have fibromyalgia or think that you may have it, and you’ve told the
doctor about your diagnosis (or your suspicion that you may have fibromyal-
gia), the doctor should also ask you questions that relate to FMS. Here are a
few examples of FMS-type questions that the doctor may ask, although don’t
expect the doctor to follow my exact wording like a script!
 Does the pain change in intensity, sometimes getting a lot worse or a lot
better?
 Does the pain move around, or is it primarily in the same place all the
time?
 Do you have morning stiffness? Do you also have stiffness throughout
the day? (Most FMS patients have some level of muscle pain, whether in
the morning or all day.)
 Do you have trouble sleeping? If so, about how many hours a night do
you think that you’re sleeping? (Sleep problems are very common
among people who have fibromyalgia.)
 Are you experiencing extreme fatigue, beyond the normal tiredness that
many people have?
106
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

Volunteering Info if the Doc 
Doesn’t Ask You about It
In most cases, the doctor will ask you questions that elicit the information
that’s needed to give you good treatment. Once in a while, however, some
facts or complaints may not come out in the course of your encounter with
your doctor. Be sure to volunteer any information that you think may be
important to your diagnosis.
Whatever happens, make sure that you accomplish the principal mission of
your office visit: Communicate your chief medical complaints to your doctor.
You may find that, for example, the doctor seems primarily concerned about
your insufficient sleep and is concentrating on that problem. But you may
feel instead that you’re being driven mad by the overwhelming pain you’re
suffering from, and the sleep deficit is actually a distant secondary problem.
From your own perspective, tell the doctor about your distress with the pain
and that it bothers you the most.
Don’t wait until the end of your doctor’s visit to tell your physician what’s
really bothering you. “Oh, doctor, I just remembered, I have excruciating pain
that goes from my neck to my back, and I also have been passing out a lot.”
I’m exaggerating for emphasis (fainting isn’t a usual symptom of fibromyalgia),
but, sometimes, patients really do hold off on revealing extremely important
information until the doctor is ready to walk out the door. Don’t make this
107
Chapter 8: Getting Physical: Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis
Setting diagnostic criteria for FMS
In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology,
a professional organization of thousands of
rheumatologists, developed criteria to help
doctors determine whether their patients had
fibromyalgia. Many (but not all) doctors of all
specialties, as well as general practitioners,
use these guidelines to help them with their
diagnoses. Very basically, these following cri-
teria were offered to doctors:
 Widespread musculoskeletal pain for at
least three months on both the right and left
sides of the body
 Pain both above and below the waist (for
example, in the neck and buttock area)
 Pain experienced when at least 11 of 18
specified tender points are touched with 
a force of about 9 pounds or less (see
“Locating your tender points,” later in this
chapter)
 Other symptoms, such as sleep disorders
and muscle stiffness

mistake — if you do, you’ll be shortchanging yourself by not accentuating
your most troubling symptoms or problems early on, when the doctor has
sufficient time to consider possible causes of your problem as well as solu-
tions that may help you.
Before your appointment, write down two or three key points you want to be
sure to discuss with the doctor, and bring the list with you to your appoint-
ment. Why? Because you may very easily forget what you’d meant to ask the
doctor, and you may find that you remember your questions only after you’ve
driven all the way back home again. Of course, you shouldn’t bring in a scroll
of complaints with you to the doctor’s office; keep your list short and simple.
Pay particular attention to volunteering information about your pain, other
doctors you’re currently seeing, and all medications, vitamins, and supple-
ments that you’re taking.
Telling your doctor about your pain
Don’t assume that your doctor will somehow automatically know that your
pain is very severe. Although most physicians are very smart and very dedi-
cated people who really want to help their patients feel better, they don’t have
108
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 
Laying out common mistakes patients make 
during physical exams
You want to get better, don’t you? Of course, you
do! But you may inadvertently make one or
more of the common errors that can impair your
diagnosis:
 Telling the doctor that you know what’s
wrong with you because your mother’s
friend’s cousin said that she has the exact
same thing, and her doctor said that it was
_____ (fill in the blank). Doctors can get
really aggravated when people assume that
a non-physician can make an accurate diag-
nosis. If a birth relative, such as a parent or
sibling, has similar problems, tell the doctor.
But let the physician make the diagnostic call.
 Spending a lot of time on small talk.
Pleasantries are nice, but the doctor’s time
is usually very limited. Get to the point as
soon as possible. Why are you here, and
what do you hope the doctor will do for you?
 Withholding information. If you’re doing
something that you think the doctor will dis-
approve of (such as drinking, smoking,
taking drugs, or some other behavior), tell
the doctor about it anyway. These behav-
iors can have a direct impact on your diag-
nosis, as well as on your treatment. Sure,
the doctor may tell you to stop these behav-
iors. But, well, shouldn’t you stop them?

an internal psychic hotline that enables them to read minds and somehow
magically know exactly how people feel or what’s distressing them the most.
So please don’t assume that your doctor will always know (or even should
know) what’s bothering you or what you really need or want. Tell the doctor.
Also, try to provide specific details, whenever possible. I know that pain can
be hard to describe. But is it a burning kind of pain? A pressure pain? A stab-
bing pain? Provide as many details as possible, so that your doctor can help
you resolve your pain problem.
If your pain has become extreme, you may be experiencing another medical
problem. Even if it is your FMS that’s causing you to hurt so badly, severe
pain requires treatment. So speak up.
Mentioning the other doctors you see
If you’re seeing other doctors in addition to the one who’s diagnosing you,
tell the doctor about it. Physicians need to know about other doctors you see
in case they have any questions that need to be followed up with those other
doctors.
Doctors often prescribe medication — that’s a fact of life. The diagnosing doc
also needs to know about all the other doctors in your life because she needs
to know about all the medicines that you’re taking — not just the ones she’s
prescribed for you.
Bringing your medications, vitamins, 
and supplements with you
If any other doctor has prescribed medications or recommended over-the-
counter medications for you, bring them along with you to your doctor’s
appointment in the original prescription bottle or the over-the-counter con-
tainer. Why? Because forgetting the dosage of your medicines is very easy —
many people do. And doctors really hate it when patients say, “It’s the little
blue pill — I forgot the name.” Do you know how many little blue pills are out
there? Too many!
The doctor needs to know what medications, vitamins, and supplements
you’re taking because he won’t want to prescribe a medicine for you that may
interact badly when taken in combination with a drug that you already take,
and because what you’re taking now may affect your lab results. To avoid
those problems, the physician must first know what you’re taking.
109
Chapter 8: Getting Physical: Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

Drugs that you buy in the health-food store or over the counter at the phar-
macy are still drugs, even if you don’t need a prescription to buy them.
“Natural” and over-the-counter drugs can often interact with or even prevent
other drugs that you’re taking from working properly. So be sure to tell your
doctor about alternative remedies that you take (including vitamins). Or
better yet — show the doctor.
Patients have nearly died (and some patients have died) because they failed
to tell their doctor about a “natural” drug they were taking. You really need to
inform your doctor about everything that you’re taking, natural or not.
Getting All Your Questions 
Out in the Open
Some people believe that if any information is important, the doctor will auto-
matically provide it to them. Based on that belief, they don’t ask questions
and are passive patients. But doctors can’t always know exactly what you’re
most concerned about or what you don’t understand. That’s why asking
questions is important. Don’t be shy! If you don’t understand something or
your doctor hasn’t covered the topic that you’re most keen on knowing about,
just ask her.
If you’re concerned that maybe the doctor wasn’t listening to you or didn’t
hear something that you said that was important to you, don’t agonize within
your mind about whether she did or didn’t hear you. Just say it again. Make
sure that the doctor is looking at you when you say it and isn’t jotting down
notes, talking on the phone, or doing some other multitasking chore. To get
the doc’s attention, say her name and wait until she looks at you. If necessary,
say the name again, even if it’s when she’s walking out the door. “Dr. Smith, I
have one more question!” If the doctor has a name that’s hard to pronounce,
use the first letter of the last name. “Dr. Z., I need to know. . . .” Most people,
including doctors, find it hard to ignore people who are calling them by name.
Identifying the Tender Points 
of Fibromyalgia
Another very important part of the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, after ruling out
other medical problems that you may have had, is for physicians to consider
whether or not you have tender points. In fact, the existence of tender points
is one of the hallmark features that help doctors to diagnose fibromyalgia.
110
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

Tender points, a key diagnostic feature of fibromyalgia, are specific areas of
the body that are very painful when gently probed. (Tender points aren’t the
same as trigger points, also covered in Chapter 6, which are lumpy or ropey
muscular knots or inflammations.) With tender points, the patient feels pain
when the area is touched, but the doctor himself can’t feel any apparent
abnormalities, nor can he detect the presence of inflammation or disease.
When the problem is fibromyalgia, the doctor typically sees nothing unusual
about the body except for the patient’s reaction — typically, wincing or cringing.
Some patients find out about their tender points for the first time during an
office visit. For example, Lucy learned about tender points in a very un-tender
way. But first, here’s some background on Lucy. She says that for years, every
time she saw any doctor, she asked the physician to explain to her why she
was so sore in the area that would be covered by an elbow-length shirt —
most of her upper body (neck, arms, back, chest). But none of the doctors
seemed to know or care what the cause of her soreness was. Then one day,
Lucy was seeing her family doctor, and she asked him if he thought that she
might have fibromyalgia. He suddenly and very unexpectedly poked her very
hard in one of the tender spots between her neck and shoulder. It hurt so
much that Lucy screamed, and she says that she nearly passed out. How did
the doctor react? He told her yes, she did have fibromyalgia. Fortunately,
most doctors aren’t as insensitive as Lucy’s (former!) doctor was.
Touching is part of the process
Doctors need to touch their patients in most physical examinations, if only to
check their basic reflexes. But touching the patient is even more important if
a person may have fibromyalgia because physical pain is a key problem faced
by most people with FMS. The doctor needs to see if it hurts when you’re
touched, as well as where it hurts, and how much it hurts.
If you try to be really brave and avoid wincing or reacting at all when the
doctor presses a tender point, or any other part of your body that hurts, how
can your doctor know that it hurts you? Don’t try to play Ms. or Mr. Stoic.
Wincing is okay. In fact, you may find it hard not to. So don’t even try.
Locating your tender points
The tender points that doctors use to help them diagnose fibromyalgia (as
developed by the American College of Rheumatology) are primarily located
on the upper torso, although a few can be found on other parts of the body,
such as in the knees. Check out Figure 8-1 for a drawing of the locations of
these tender points. All these tender points add up to a grand total of 18. 
111
Chapter 8: Getting Physical: Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

And according to the guidelines established by the American College of
Rheumatology, to obtain an official diagnosis of fibromyalgia, you must feel
pain during palpation in 11 or more of them. (For more info regarding these
guidelines, check out the “Setting diagnostic criteria for FMS” sidebar, earlier
in this chapter.) Hopefully, you won’t feel pain in all 18 places!

Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 
How do doctors diagnose people?
In general, most doctors diagnose patients with
a process that is called a differential diagnosis,
which means that they consider all the possible
things that may be wrong with you, based on
your symptoms, gender, age, geographic loca-
tion, and other factors. They then narrow the
diagnosis down to the most likely one.
For example, if you’re a woman living in Peoria,
Illinois, you’re unlikely to have malaria. If you’re
a man, you flat out will not have menstrual
problems. For possible fibromyalgia sufferers,
the doctor considers the location of your pain/
discomfort to aid with the diagnosis. If you’re
suffering from painful cramps in your toes, you
may have fibromyalgia — but you may also
have a vitamin deficiency or a problem with
dehydration. Laboratory tests help the doctor
rule out other medical problems and further
narrow down the list to what is most likely.

Of course, people with fibromyalgia frequently have tenderness that’s not
limited to these 18 areas. Consequently, if you hurt elsewhere, that pain’s
probably from your fibromyalgia, too. In addition, some tender points may be
very sore on one day and other tender points may even be painful on other
days. The specific tender points as depicted in Figure 8-1 were selected by
doctors as those areas that are most characteristic of people with FMS,
which is why they’re often used in the diagnostic process.
Assigning a tender number to FMS
According to the American College of Rheumatology, a person should 
have some pain in at least 11 of the 18 tender points to be diagnosed with
fibromyalgia. Some doctors follow this guideline, while others think that if
you have nine or ten tender points (or even fewer) but you meet other crite-
ria, you may have fibromyalgia.
The presence of many tender points indicates a high probability that
fibromyalgia exists — if other medical problems have been ruled out and if
you also exhibit other symptoms of FMS, such as severe fatigue, difficulty
with insomnia, or other sleep problems. Whether the doctor is a stickler for a
given number of tender points as a cutoff really depends on the physician.
Rheumatologists are probably the most likely to consider tender points as
very important because rheumatologists were the ones who devised this cri-
teria and also because it’s quantitative data in an area where hard data and
verification aren’t easy to come by.
One problem with using tender points as mandatory diagnostic criteria is
that fibromyalgia is a very changeable syndrome. As a result, most people
who have fibromyalgia feel better on some days and worse on others. This
inconsistency means that some people who really do have fibromyalgia may
only “score” with nine or ten tender points on a given day, but the following
week, they could have pain in all 18 tender-point areas. It also means that if
patients see their doctors on the day they have fewer than 11 tender points
and the physicians are very rigid about the tender-points criteria, some cases
of FMS won’t be diagnosed.
Test-ifying about FMS
Most of the tests that doctors order when they think that you may have
fibromyalgia are really tests for other medical problems. Although doctors
should take a hard look at the symptoms you exhibit, they can’t say for sure
that you have fibromyalgia until they’re able to rule out those other diseases
and conditions. FMS has no specific tests, other than the tender-points criteria
113
Chapter 8: Getting Physical: Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

described earlier. In the future, doctors may test you for hormones and other
body chemicals that may be higher or lower when you have fibromyalgia. But
that’s not happening right now.
Ordering up a round of lab tests
Part of your physical examination may include laboratory tests, such as blood
tests and urinalysis. It’s normal for the doctor to want such tests to be done,
so don’t be alarmed if your doctor orders them.
Ruling out autoimmune disorders
The pain of fibromyalgia may appear to the doctor to be the beginnings of
rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, both very serious and deteriorating arthritic
conditions. Another possibility is multiple sclerosis, also a serious disease. 
In addition, the doctor will often want to verify that you don’t have a thyroid
disease. Hypothyroidism, or below-normal levels of thyroid hormone, can also
cause fatigue and muscle and joint pain. Sometimes these conditions can
coexist with fibromyalgia.
These diseases are known as autoimmune disorders, or diseases resulting from
the body’s immune system actually attacking itself. A blood test will reveal if
your blood includes a special factor that indicates that you may have rheuma-
toid arthritis or lupus. If the blood test comes back negative, you’re unlikely
to have them. A spinal-fluid examination can detect antibodies that are char-
acteristic of multiple sclerosis.
A blood test can also measure the level of circulating thyroid hormone. 
If your levels are out of range, you’re hypothyroid (low thyroid levels) or
hyperthyroid (excessively high levels of thyroid hormone). The doctor can
also check a sedimentation rate to identify inflammation, and he can order 
a chemistry panel, which will show how well (or poorly) your kidneys and
liver are functioning.
Excluding blood diseases
The doctor will also often order a complete blood count (CBC), which is a count
of your red and white blood cells. It’s also a check on whether you may have
a blood disease that can cause a person to feel weak and achy, such as anemia
or another blood disease. If the CBC comes back normal, in most cases, you
don’t have such a disease. The doctor will also usually order a test of your
blood glucose to rule out diabetes (characterized by hyperglycemia, or high
levels of blood glucose) or, at the other end of the scale, hypoglycemia, a con-
dition of unusually low blood sugar.
114
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

Verifying it’s not a vitamin deficiency
Blood tests can also verify if you’re deficient in any major vitamins (such as
Vitamin B12 or Vitamin D) or minerals (such as calcium, magnesium, or potas-
sium). A vitamin or mineral shortage can cause pain and weakness.
Sometimes, people who take medications for an illness can develop a vitamin
or mineral deficiency, which leads to side effects and symptoms. For example,
people with high blood pressure (also known as hypertension) may need medi-
cation, which can lead to a side effect of depleting the body of potassium.
Someone suffering from a potassium deficiency may be able to just eat a few
bananas a day to make up for this deficiency, or may need to take supplemen-
tal potassium every day to reach normalcy. The blood tests that you have will
show whether you have a deficiency and, if one is present, how severe it is.
Counting out infectious illnesses
The same CBC that the doc uses to rule out blood diseases can also show
whether you may have an infection, because your white blood cell count will
be slightly (or very much) higher than normal — although usually not dan-
gerously higher than normal, as found with a blood disease.
The doctor should also screen your blood for hepatitis B and C, which may
cause fibromyalgia-like symptoms. (Read more about these problems in
Chapter 3.)
Doctors may also test for Lyme disease, particularly for patients who live in
the northeastern part of the United States. (Read more about Lyme disease,
which is a diagnosis sometimes confused with FMS, in Chapter 6.)
If you’ve had blood transfusions in the past or have been engaged in some
high-risk behaviors, like taking illicit drugs, your doctor may also check you
for HIV (the virus that causes AIDS).
In addition, the urine can be checked for possible kidney disease. High levels
of protein in the urine (also known as proteinuria) or of other elements that
are not normally present may indicate the beginning of a kidney disease that
needs to be treated.
Testing the function of your 
autonomic nervous system
A characteristic abnormality of FMS is hyperactivation of the autonomic 
nervous system (ANS). This system is in overdrive in patients with FMS.
Characteristic changes include increased resting pulse rate (more than 
115
Chapter 8: Getting Physical: Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

60 beats per minute), dizziness or fainting when standing up, and cold hands
or feet. Some easy tests can identify these abnormalities, including pulse and
blood-pressure readings while lying down or standing up. A more sophisti-
cated test is tilt-table testing, which measures your heart rate and blood
pressure during position changes.
Considering CT scans or MRIs
In some cases, the doctor will decide that you need a special scan of the part
of your body that’s causing you pain. The physician may order a high-tech 
X-ray, known as a computerized tomography (CT) scan, or may order a mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) test. The doctor may also order regular X-rays,
if he or she thinks that you may have arthritis or other bone changes.
The CT scan, MRI, and X-rays aren’t invasive and they don’t cause any pain.
However, some people are disturbed by the noise generated by the MRI
machine. Because people with fibromyalgia can be hypersensitive to noise,
they’re also more likely to be distressed by the MRI. Many MRI technicians
offer a solution to this problem by giving you headphones to listen to music
during the procedure.
Another potential issue with having an MRI is that your body is enclosed in 
a small area. If you suffer from claustrophobia, or anxiety or fear about being
in confined spaces, you may want to ask the doctor to give you a mild seda-
tive before you have the MRI. Of course, if you do take a sedative, you’ll need
someone to drive you there and then drive you home afterward. In some
cases, your doctor may be able to order an open-sided MRI for you, avoiding
the problem of claustrophobia, although not all insurance companies cover
the use of this equipment.
Doctors use MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays to rule out a number of possibilities:
 Bone diseases: The X-rays, CT scan, or MRI will check for any fractures
or abnormalities of the skeletal system, such as those caused by arthritis
or other diseases. And yes, you can have a minor fracture and still be
walking around — although you probably won’t be walking perfectly
normally and you’ll have at least some pain.
 Other diseases: An MRI can also rule out some diseases, such as multiple
sclerosis.
 Brain abnormalities: These tests can rule out problems, such as a brain
tumor or aneurysm (a tiny blood vessel about to burst).
 Organic problems: One or more of your major organs may be malfunc-
tioning, anywhere from your thyroid gland to your colon to any other
organ in any system of your body.
116
Part II: Finding Out Whether You Have Fibromyalgia 

Using ultrasound for diagnosis
An ultrasound is a special device that uses sound waves to create outlines of
an organ. Along with other tests, it can be helpful with diagnosis. A pregnant
woman typically has at least one or two ultrasounds of her baby during the
course of her pregnancy, so that the obstetrician can make sure that the fetus
is developing normally.
An ultrasound isn’t invasive and is usually not painful, unless the ultrasound
wand is pressed against an area of the body that’s hurting. The ultrasound
technician will be as gentle as possible.
An ultrasound can detect the following:
 Organic abnormalities: The doctor will usually order the ultrasound to
check areas of the body that are most prone to problems. For example,
could you have a problem with your gall bladder, stomach, or colon? A
combination of the physical examination, your answers to the doctor’s
questions, and the laboratory tests and ultrasound will together help
rule out organic abnormalities that are causing your medical problem.
 Tissue/nerve problems: Is there inflammation? With fibromyalgia,
patients do not have any inflammation that’s detectable in standard 
laboratory tests. If your ultrasound reveals inflammation or tissue
damage, you have another medical problem rather than (or in addition
to) fibromyalgia. If no inflammation or tissue damage is apparent from
an ultrasound, most doctors will perform a neurological exam, which
includes testing your reflexes and your responses to pressure and touch.
It may also be important to test your muscle strength because some rare
muscle diseases can mimic fibromyalgia.

about this aggravating problem — and that’s the purpose
of Part III, which covers a broad array of treatment options.

which is basically therapy that touches your skin and
muscles such as icing and heating, massage therapy, topi-
cal ointments, and other options.
And I don’t forget alternative remedies! Some good (and
some less-than-good) alternative remedies exist for
people with fibromyalgia, and I cover the gamut. I review
the latest information on supplements, homeopathy,
acupuncture, Botox injections, magnet therapy, and a few
other intriguing choices. I offer my expert opinion on each
option.

G
uaifenesin (pronounced gway-fehn-ih-sin) is a cough medicine pro-
moted by some patients and doctors as a treatment for fibromyalgia
syndrome (FMS).
Tina says that she feels so much better since she’s started taking guaifenesin
to treat her fibromyalgia. According to Tina, she still has plenty of back pain,
fatigue, and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. But compared to how she felt
before, Tina says that she’s radically better now. Marcy, on the other hand,
has been taking guaifenesin faithfully for two years and has yet to see any
results. But Marcy figures that the positive effects should kick in anytime
now, so she’s continuing to take the drug. Tom took guaifenesin for a month,
but didn’t notice any improvement in his condition, so he gave up on it.
Anecdotal recommendations are usually worthy of consideration when it comes
to finding a plumber or even a doctor. But I think a far better way to consider
whether to take medications such as guaifenesin, as well as other over-the-
counter (nonprescribed) remedies for fibromyalgia, is to look at existing clini-
cal studies, as well as consider patient comments. I provide both objective
data and subjective anecdotal information on guaifenesin in this chapter.
I include guaifenesin as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug, because it’s available
in an OTC strength, and many people who take it rely on OTC guaifenesin. An
over-the-counter drug is a medication that doesn’t require a prescription from
your doctor, but it’s still regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
and the FDA can pull it off the market if problems develop. However, guaifen-
esin is also available in a prescribed strength, as are some of the other medi-
cations described in this chapter.

In this chapter, I also cover antihistamines (cold-medicine-type remedies),
painkilling remedies (such as Tylenol, aspirin, and ibuprofen), and topical pain-
relief remedies (ointments, creams, and so on that you can rub into your
skin, allowing — you hope — at least a temporary reprieve from your pain).
Considering Guaifenesin
Guaifenesin is an expectorant, a drug that thins out and loosens your mucous,
making it easier to cough up. Guaifenesin is also one ingredient found in
popular cough syrups; however, individuals who support taking guaifenesin
for the symptoms of fibromyalgia believe that it’s best to take guaifenesin
alone, without other added drugs.
Some guaifenesin supporters take an over-the-counter dose of the drug;
others take a prescribed level. Some individuals supplement prescription
guaifenesin with OTC guaifenesin. And still others take a prescription-level
dose of guaifenesin by taking many OTC guaifenesin tablets. I don’t recom-
mend this practice at all — I believe that your doctor should monitor pre-
scribed drug strengths.
Taking high doses of OTC drugs can be very dangerous, and people have
accidentally died this way. It can be harmful to act on the mistaken belief that
if two pills would be good (if recommended on the bottle), then four would
be twice as good. Don’t make this mistake.
Guaifenesin is not an FDA-approved treatment for fibromyalgia. So far, clinical
studies have not proven that guaifenesin is an effective treatment for people
who have fibromyalgia or any other ailment beyond a serious cough or chronic
asthma. (Take a look at the “Studying guaifenesin” section in this chapter for
some info on the one clinical study of guaifenesin.) So what’s the real deal on
guai, as its proponents affectionately like to call it?
Looking at some background info
Guaifenesin as a solution to fibromyalgia was the brainchild of Dr. Paul 
St. Armand, an endocrinologist from California. Dr. St. Armand believes that
people with fibromyalgia build up caches of chemicals (phosphates) in their
bodies, and these deposits cause pain and other symptoms characteristic of
fibromyalgia.
Dr. St. Armand also believes, based on personal and anecdotal observations
of his patients, that the regular taking of guaifenesin can slowly rid the body
122
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

of these chemical deposits and that it will eventually make patients with
fibromyalgia feel dramatically better. Some people are said to feel well more
quickly than others; supposedly, some patients may wait a year or longer
before gaining noticeable benefits from taking the drug.
Studying guaifenesin
Some doctors take a neutral stance about the use of guaifenesin, and others
are more negative, saying that because the use of guaifenesin for FMS isn’t
backed up by clinical studies, it should never be used to treat fibromyalgia.
Other physicians believe if the drug doesn’t cause identifiable harm, it’s
okay for patients with FMS to try, as long as competent doctors follow the
patients.
Clinical studies to date haven’t validated the use of guaifenesin as a treatment
for fibromyalgia. Dr. Robert Bennett, a highly respected rheumatologist and
clinical researcher in Oregon, performed a one-year clinical study on guaifen-
esin among 40 women diagnosed with fibromyalgia. (The study wasn’t pub-
lished in a journal, but it’s available at www.myalgia.com/guaif2.htm.)
Dr. Bennett subsequently concluded that guaifenesin didn’t significantly
improve the subjects’ fibromyalgia symptoms, compared to the effects 
of the placebo (sugar pill) on the control group. Dr. St. Armand, an advisor to
the researchers of the clinical study, has disputed the study findings. But 
to date, no other clinical studies have been performed that support or refute
Dr. Bennett’s research. No one can definitively state that guaifenesin doesn’t
help fibromyalgia, based on just one study that refutes its value. Nor can
anyone say with certainty that guaifenesin helps FMS symptoms. The only
thing that’s absolutely clear is that further studies are needed.
Joining the fan club
Although guaifenesin has no clinical proof that it works, there is a lot of anec-
dotal evidence that the drug helps some patients. These testimonials come
from individuals convinced that guaifenesin has played a major role in their
improvement. For example, Susan, a long-time sufferer of FMS, says that
guaifenesin has given her back a normal life — one she thought had been lost
forever. Last year, Susan says that she could barely climb a flight of stairs. But
now, she goes up and down stairs several times a day effortlessly, the way
most adults unthinkingly use stairs.
Kathy is another fibromyalgia sufferer, and she says that the only drug that
has given her any symptomatic relief whatsoever has been guaifenesin.
Susan and Kathy believe that guaifenesin has been a life changer for them.
But others say that guaifenesin hasn’t helped at all, or made them feel worse.
123
Chapter 9: Medicating the Problem: Over-the-Counter Drugs May Help

If you want to contact supporters of the use of guaifenesin and discover their
information about its use in treating fibromyalgia, you can go to a Web site of
a support group at www.psha-inc.com/guai-support/. Or go directly to
the site of the doctor who promotes guaifenesin as a fibromyalgia therapy at
www.guaidoc.com.
Ordering guaifenesin
If you decide to try guaifenesin, you may have a hard time finding the drug by
itself in your local drugstore, because it’s usually one ingredient in OTC cold
remedies. However, you can ask your pharmacist to order you an OTC dose
of guaifenesin alone.
You can also order an OTC dose of guaifenesin over the Internet, but generally,
you’re better off working with your local pharmacist. State medical boards
strongly disapprove of doctors and pharmacies who prescribe drugs for
people they have no direct personal relationship with, because they worry
about possible overdoses or side effects. For this reason, I advise against
ordering from anyone who sells drugs over the Internet.
Don’t take guaifenesin on your own without discussing it with your doctor.
Combined with other medications that you may take, or with other medical
problems that you may have, guaifenesin may be inadvisable for you.
Weighing the pros and cons of guaifenesin
In this section, I offer a brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages
of guaifenesin use as a treatment for fibromyalgia.
Accentuating the positives
Simply put, here are the basic advantages of guaifenesin treatment:
 It’s generally an inexpensive medication.
 Guaifenesin has few or no side effects for most users, although some
side effects are listed later in this chapter and in Appendix B.
 You won’t need a prescription for the low doses of the drug.
Looking at the drawbacks
The key disadvantage of taking guaifenesin is that it may not make you feel
any better. The only way to know whether some drugs work is to take them
and see what happens.
124
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Another disadvantage is that many people who support taking guaifenesin
won’t believe you if you say it’s not helping you. These individuals may say
that if guaifenesin isn’t working for you, it’s your fault — you’re not taking
enough of the drug or you’re doing something else wrong. If you rely on such
views, you could find yourself in a confused or self-blaming state — neither of
which is helpful.
Along the same lines, hard-core guai supporters will tell you the drug is work-
ing regardless of how you feel. Ironically, if you feel worse when you take
guaifenesin, guai supporters believe this is “proof” that the drug is working
because it’s allegedly ridding your body of pain-inducing chemicals, such as
phosphates. If you feel better, that means that the drug’s working, too. And if
you don’t feel anything, don’t worry: Supposedly, you’ll soon feel better or
worse, and you’ll know that it’s working.
Although guaifenesin has few side effects, some people have bad reactions 
to it. Here are some of the more common reactions:
 The drug may cause skin itching and rashes.
 It sometimes causes nausea and vomiting.
 Guaifenesin may also cause drowsiness in some individuals.
 Some people say that it exacerbates their symptoms of fibromyalgia.
I can’t rule out guaifenesin as a possible remedy for fibromyalgia until further
studies are performed, but I can’t support it as a surefire remedy, either.
Relieving Pain with Painkillers
Your doctor may prescribe painkilling medications or other types of drugs 
to help you cope with the aching, stiffness, and overall pain of fibromyalgia.
(Read Chapter 10 for more information on prescribed medications.) But if
your symptoms have lessened somewhat and you still feel like you need
something for pain relief, an over-the-counter painkilling medication may be
the right answer for you. In the following sections, I cover a few options.
Acetaminophen
You probably know this drug by a different name, Tylenol. (There are also
generic forms of acetaminophen.)
125
Chapter 9: Medicating the Problem: Over-the-Counter Drugs May Help

The simple short-term benefit of taking over-the-counter Tylenol is that it
may give you a temporary respite from widespread body aches and pains.
Many people see Tylenol as extremely safe, and it generally is a safe medica-
tion. However, long-term and heavy use of Tylenol can damage the liver —
the organ that breaks down the drug. You may be better off, at least once in a
while, taking ibuprofen instead.
Don’t consume any alcohol when taking Tylenol (including any form of Tylenol,
whether over-the-counter Tylenol or prescribed medications with Tylenol in
them like Tylenol 3, which is Tylenol and codeine). When Tylenol is com-
bined with alcohol, it can cause serious damage to your liver. Livers come
only one to a customer, and you can’t live without your liver. So be extremely
careful about your alcohol/Tylenol consumption. The best way to do that is
to not drink when taking Tylenol.
Aspirin
Aspirin can be a very effective painkiller, and it’s also often used (usually at
very low daily doses) by people who are at risk of suffering from heart attacks
or strokes or from having another stroke.
But aspirin can also cause serious gastrointestinal upset, and it may even
lead to stomach bleeding as well as the development of gastritis, an inflam-
mation of the stomach. Don’t assume that aspirin is always “safe” just
because you’ve been taking it all your life. It’s still a drug. Use aspirin with
caution.
Ibuprofen
Ibuprofen is the generic name for Advil, Motrin, or other forms of the drug.
It’s a painkilling drug that’s available over the counter. The primary benefit of
ibuprofen is the pain relief that it can bring.
The main drawback of ibuprofen is that it can cause serious gastrointestinal
distress, including ulcers, gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and so forth.
Other possible side effects that may occur include headaches, tinnitus (ring-
ing in the ears), and dizziness. These side effects usually don’t occur except
with high doses over a long period, but some people are more sensitive than
others and may develop problems sooner.
126
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Naproxen
Naproxen is the generic name for Aleve, the only over-the-counter form of
naproxen approved by the FDA. Aleve is available in tablet form and should
be taken with milk or food to avoid stomach upset. Like most painkillers of
this type, it should be taken for only a short time without recommendation
by a doctor. Its key benefit is pain relief.
Naproxen’s primary drawback is that it may slightly increase the risk of heart
attack and stroke, especially if taken long-term. The risk for gastrointestinal
disease is also increased, including such problems as heartburn, ulcers, and
gastritis. Other side effects that may occur with naproxen include diarrhea or
constipation, mouth sores, headache, dizziness, ringing in the ears, and light-
headedness. As with ibuprofen, some people are more susceptible to side
effects than others.
Warming Up to Cold Remedies 
for Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is very different from the common cold, unless you want to
factor in the generalized aches and pains of a severe flu into your “cold”
equation. (Many people say that fibromyalgia feels like a semipermanent case
of the flu to them, with periodic breaks of feeling a little better.)
Despite this difference, some remedies that are given to people with colds,
bronchitis, and related ailments may be helpful to people who have fibromyal-
gia. I cover guaifenesin (a remedy that’s effective in coping with cough) at the
beginning of the chapter, so here I move on to other cold remedies that people
with FMS have tried.
Dealing with dextromethorphan
Some studies have researched whether taking regular doses of dextromethor-
phan, an anticough medication, could help some people cope more effec-
tively with their symptoms of fibromyalgia. Some researchers who’ve studied
dextromethorphan, such as Dr. Robert Bennett, a prominent rheumatologist,
initially found that low levels of dextromethorphan were ineffective in sub-
jects with fibromyalgia. However, when the dosage of dextromethorphan was
increased, the research subjects reported that their pain had significantly
decreased.
127
Chapter 9: Medicating the Problem: Over-the-Counter Drugs May Help

Another study (one I conducted) found that dextromethorphan decreases
pain sensitivity of FMS patients. Using this drug can reduce the achiness that
many FMS patients feel. To get this effect, the drug must be used at prescrip-
tion strength (60 mg to 90 mg twice per day), which requires a prescription
from a doctor.
In one study of the effectiveness of dextromethorphan, the drug was found 
to potentiate, or boost the effect of Ultram (generic name: tramadol), a pre-
scribed painkilling medication. But further studies are needed before I can
recommend dextromethorphan as an OTC remedy for fibromyalgia.
Some people are trying dextromethorphan now. People who follow this course
should discuss it first with their physicians to make sure dextromethorphan
won’t interact with other medications that they take and will be safe for
them.
Locating a source for dextromethorphan tablets as a stand-alone drug may 
be difficult because it’s usually an ingredient in cold medicines. You can ask
your pharmacist to order it for you in the OTC strength. (Obviously, the phar-
macist won’t give you the prescribed strength without a prescription from
your doctor.) Another possible option is to purchase Delsym (generic name:
dextromethorphan polistirex). This OTC drug comes in a liquid form, and
supposedly is chemically akin to dextromethorphan. (Delsym does include 
a small amount of alcohol and, thus, may be sedating.)
Trying antihistamines
In addition to cough medicine, some other drugs that are normally classified
as antihistamines, or “cold medicines,” may give some people with fibromyal-
gia some (or even a lot of) relief from their overall aches and pains. The most
popular examples are Benadryl and Tylenol PM.
Cold or allergy medications may help some people with fibromyalgia because
they may affect the serotonin levels, much as some antidepressants also can
alleviate some of the pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia by affecting
the circulating levels of neurochemicals (brain chemicals such as serotonin,
norepinephrine, or dopamine, which may affect mood and pain). Substance P
is another neurochemical that can affect your pain level.
Because many antihistamines make you drowsy, they may also help with
sleep problems. Be careful with driving or activities that require alertness
when you take these drugs, unless they specify that they’re “non-drowsy.”
128
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Talking about Topical Remedies
Can you gain pain relief from an over-the-counter ointment that you merely
rub into your skin? Sometimes topical remedies can help, even if the relief
lasts a few hours. Often these drugs work for people with arthritis, but they
can be beneficial for people with fibromyalgia, too. (Read about Lidoderm, a
prescribed skin patch that helps many people with FMS, in Chapter 10.)
Considering your options
Skin ointments are available in any pharmacy and most supermarkets, and
there are too many brands to list here. Most are creams, but there are a few
spray-on remedies. Most contain minor anesthetics such as the following
ingredients:
 Capsaicin (derived from chili peppers): When it works, capsaicin can
anesthetize parts of your body where you’ve rubbed it on your skin by
reducing your level of Substance P (the pain neurochemical) and also by
dulling the pain receptors at the level of your skin’s surface.
 Cayenne (comes from hot peppers): Like capsaicin, cayenne can cause
the skin to heat up, thus causing the muscles to relax.
 Eucalyptus (taken from the tree that is the major diet of koala bears):
This substance can act as a mild stimulant to the skin, causing tense
muscles to loosen up.
 Menthol: You may find that menthol “cleans out your sinuses” with its
very pronounced aroma. It may also provide you with temporary relief
from your minor muscle pains and strains.
 Methyl salicylate (derived from aspirin): Many topical ointments
include salicylate, an aspirin-based substance. These drugs may act as
both a combination painkiller and an anesthetic when rubbed into the
skin. They also bypass the gastrointestinal system, so if you’ve found
that aspirin hurts your stomach, that won’t likely be a problem for you
with a skin rub.
 Peppermint oil: Often thought of solely as a flavoring, peppermint oil
can also be a mild painkiller for sore and tense muscles.
In addition to these ointments, a variety of other ingredients can help numb
muscle pain that’s close to the surface of the skin. (Your doctor can also rec-
ommend prescribed topical agents. They may include the same types of
ingredients, but at a significantly greater strength.)
129
Chapter 9: Medicating the Problem: Over-the-Counter Drugs May Help

When you or anyone else uses a topical ointment, make sure that the person
who’s doing the rubbing thoroughly washes his hands directly afterward. 
You don’t want this substance to be accidentally applied to your eyes or to
anyone else’s, or to any other body part that may be sensitive to burning.
Deciding which topical remedy is best
One of the main difficulties with topical remedies lies in choosing which one
to buy! You have many different ones to choose from and may find it hard to
decide which one’s right for you. Don’t go by price only: The cheapest oint-
ment isn’t always the best choice — nor is the most expensive ointment nec-
essarily the most effective.
When looking at various brands of topical ointments to help you ease muscu-
lar aches and pains, here are a few pointers to consider:
 Have you bought this brand before? If it worked for you before, it may
work again. If it didn’t work before, no matter what new and dramatic
promises are made in advertisements, it probably still won’t work now.
 Is this drug odor-free or will everyone within 500 yards know you’re
coming if you use this product? If you want to be unnoticed in the
world, choose the drug without an obnoxious aroma. If it doesn’t matter
because you’re going to bed, and don’t care what you smell like as long
as you get pain relief, skip this criterion.
 Can you buy a small tube or “sample-size” container in case you
haven’t tried this drug before, and don’t know if it’ll help? If you don’t
like the medication, you won’t have wasted your money on the larger
size. If a small or sample size isn’t available, you may have to risk money
if you think the product may work for you.
 What are the ingredients in this medication? Does the drug have ingre-
dients you want to avoid? Some people want to stay away from drugs
that include salicylate (aspirin). Perhaps, you don’t like another ingredi-
ent. Also, be sure to check for ingredients that you’re allergic to.
 Is this drug reasonably priced, and can you afford it? When you’re in
severe pain, almost any amount may seem reasonable. But don’t let
yourself get ripped off by people taking advantage of your desperation.
Check the label for the ingredients. The expensive stuff may include the
same ingredients as the lower-cost drug.

N
atalie has had fibromyalgia for about ten years, and says that she
absolutely could not get through a single day without her pain medica-
tion. Natalie honestly believes that she’d be suicidal from the pain by now if
it weren’t for her medications. The few times that Natalie has waited until the
last minute to refill her prescriptions and had to go a day before she got her
medicine (because the pharmacy had just run out of the drug), were not days
that you’d want to be around her, she says.
Is Natalie a drug addict, or maybe a hypochondriac? No, she fits neither cate-
gory. Natalie isn’t a drug addict, because she’s taking her medication to alle-
viate her pain and not to induce pleasure. Nor is Natalie a hypochondriac.
Hypochondriacs misinterpret their symptoms and worry about imagined ill-
nesses, but fibromyalgia pain is undeniably real, and it can be very severe.
Natalie says that the medications she takes don’t take all the pain away —
they make her pain tolerable, so she can lead a relatively normal life.
Dave also has fibromyalgia, but he takes medications intermittently. Sometimes,
the pain is severe, and he needs a strong painkiller. Other days, he’s able to
forego taking any medication altogether.

You may be more like Natalie, needing to take medications daily, or maybe
you’re more like Dave, who doesn’t need medicines every day. But when you
have fibromyalgia, at some point in time, you’ll need prescribed medications.
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the key drugs that doctors pre-
scribe for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and the benefits and risks associated
with these drugs. I talk about muscle relaxants, painkilling medications, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsive drugs, anti-anxiety medica-
tions, sleep remedies, and other drugs, as well as some treatments you may
see in the future. So read on and discover how you can combat the pain.
Relaxing Your Fibromyalgia: 
Muscle Relaxants
Many people with fibromyalgia complain of muscle aches and pains, so many
physicians prescribe muscle relaxants. These drugs do more than just what
they sound like: They soothe your overtensed muscles and reduce your 
pain — but they often do more than that, such as improve sleep and decrease
depression.
Be sure to avoid alcohol when you’re taking muscle relaxants. One muscle
relaxant, Soma (generic name: carisoprodol), can cause an opium-like high in
some people when it’s combined with alcohol. Also, even if you don’t drink,
avoid driving when taking any muscle relaxant. The sedating effects of the
muscle relaxant can cause you to become an impaired driver.
Naming names
Flexeril (generic name: cyclobenzaprine) is the most commonly prescribed
muscle relaxant. This drug often also acts as a mild antidepressant because
Flexeril increases the level of serotonin in the bloodstream. People who have
been prescribed Flexeril generally take this medication in the evening because
it can cause major sleepiness. Flexeril may work well for you, or it may not.
Often, the only way to know is to try it and see what effect it has on your
aching body. One study of 120 patients with fibromyalgia indicated that 
84 percent of the patients who took Flexeril significantly improved. They
experienced decreased pain, improved sleep, and a reduction in the number
of their tender points.
Here are some examples of other muscle relaxants that are often prescribed
to treat FMS pain (again, they may be effective for you, or they may not be):
132
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

 Baclofen (generic name: liorisol)
 Norflex (generic name: orphenadrine citrate)
 Skelaxin (generic name: metaxalone)
 Soma (generic name: carisoprodol)
 Zanaflex (generic name: tizanidine HCl)
A combination of Soma and acetaminophen is also available. It’s called Soma
Compound.
Weighing the risks and benefits 
of muscle relaxants
The primary benefits of muscle relaxants are that they may provide tempo-
rary pain relief. In addition, the sedating action of most muscle relaxants can
help FMS patients with trouble sleeping to avoid yet another sleepless night.
On the negative side, the chief side effect of many muscle relaxants is gas-
trointestinal distress, such as stomach pain and diarrhea. This gastrointestinal
problem may range from mild to severe, depending on the particular drug
and the particular patient. At the extreme end of side effects, muscle relax-
ants can damage the stomach, as with gastritis (an inflammation of the stom-
ach) or even stomach ulcers or duodenal (small intestine) ulcers.
Although one drug in a class of medications may cause side effects, some-
times another drug in the same class may not cause the same side effects.
Thus, if your doctor orders another muscle relaxant even after you tried 
one muscle relaxant that caused side effects, you should try the second one
because you may have better luck with another drug.
Easing Pain with Painkillers
Most people with fibromyalgia need to take prescribed painkilling medica-
tions, at least some of the time, in order to cope with the widespread pain
and stiffness — symptoms that are so characteristic of FMS.
Of course, some people with fibromyalgia may not need to take their painkilling
medications every single day. Also, on some days, muscle relaxants, milder
painkillers, or even over-the-counter analgesics (painkillers) may be sufficient
to manage the pain for many people who have fibromyalgia.
133
Chapter 10: Prescribing Health with Medications

Considering key pros and cons of 
prescribed painkilling medications
The most obvious benefit of taking a prescribed painkilling medication is
that, if it works, the medication makes your pain go away or makes it more
tolerable. But painkilling meds have a few other benefits as well:
 If you take a painkilling medication at the same time as your pain is
continuing on its upward path, you can often thwart the pain from
getting any worse and prevent it from ever reaching the high scream-
zone of agony. In that way, your painkilling medication is acting as a 
preventive medicine.
 Taking painkillers when you’re in severe pain can also aid your immune
system. How? Basically, your body won’t need to divert so much effort
and energy to concentrating so hard on coping with the pain. With pain
relief, your immune system can work much more efficiently.
Taking painkilling medications also has some disadvantages that every
person should consider before taking these drugs.
 Side effects may be problematic for you, causing you to feel drowsy
and unable to drive yourself to work, school, or anywhere else that
you want to go. Painkilling drugs can also be very constipating, causing
you to need to change your diet (eating more fiber, fruits, and vegeta-
bles, and drinking more water) or to take laxatives.
 Your doctor may be hesitant to prescribe painkilling medications
because of state and federal laws designed to curb drug abuse. You
may feel as though your doctor regards you as a drug addict simply
because you asked him for pain medication to give you some relief. Read
more about why some doctors are hesitant to prescribe painkillers in
the “Prescribing painkillers: The dilemma” section, later in this chapter.
Investigating controlled/scheduled drugs
Some painkillers, including narcotics, fall into controlled-drug categories. (All
narcotics are controlled drugs.) A narcotic is a painkilling drug classified as
having a significant risk to cause addiction. Many narcotics are opium based
(such as morphine and codeine), while others are synthetically derived, such
as Duragesic (generic name: fentanyl) and methadone. From a patient’s per-
spective, the key benefit to a narcotic is the pain relief that it provides and
the return of physical and social functioning.
134
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

The U.S. federal agency known as the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) has designated specific medications as scheduled drugs because they
can be dangerous, addicting, or habit forming. Drugs designated as sched-
uled drugs require more monitoring and record keeping by doctors and phar-
macists because of their high potential for abuse. Some scheduled drugs are
painkillers that help people with fibromyalgia, while others are used only for
abuse, such as heroin, LSD, or crack cocaine.
Narcotics aren’t the only drugs that have been identified by the DEA as
potential drugs of abuse. Amphetamines, anabolic steroids, and other types
of drugs are also addicting drugs “scheduled” by the DEA (see the nearby
“Scheduled drugs and fibromyalgia” sidebar).
135
Chapter 10: Prescribing Health with Medications
Scheduled drugs and fibromyalgia
Under the Controlled Substances Act, passed
by Congress in 1970, controlled drugs fall into
five schedules (or categories) of drugs, based
on the risk for addictiveness, with Schedule I
having the highest risk of addiction and
Schedule V the lowest risk of this group:
 Schedule I: Drugs categorized as having
major potential for drug abuse. Drugs such
as heroin and LSD are in Schedule I. These
drugs have no value to patients who have
fibromyalgia. They are all illegal drugs.
 Schedule II: These drugs also have poten-
tial for abuse, albeit less than the drugs in
Schedule I. Cocaine is included on the
Schedule II list (some doctors have legiti-
mate uses for the drug), as is methadone.
Some fibromyalgia patients may take
methadone for pain control, and others take
Percocet or Percodan (both are forms of
oxycodone). Some people with fibromyalgia
have also used Duragesic patches and
found them beneficial, in large part because
of their timed-release benefit. Unfortunately,
Duragesic has become a popular drug for
people wanting to abuse drugs to get high.
As a result of this problem, legitimate
patients sometimes have a hard time get-
ting prescriptions for Duragesic patches.
 Schedule III: This category includes medi-
cations such as Tylenol 3 (Tylenol with
codeine), Vicodin or Lortab (two forms of
hydrocodone), and barbiturate medications,
such as Fiorcet (butalbital). Some fibromyal-
gia patients take these drugs for pain control.
 Schedule IV: Patients with fibromyalgia
needing an anti-anxiety drug may take
Valium (generic name: diazepam) or Xanax
(generic name: alprazolam), which both fall
under this schedule, as do other anti-anxiety
medications.
 Schedule V: Some medications that include
codeine, such as cough syrups with codeine,
are categorized by the DEA as scheduled
drugs. These drugs are generally less help-
ful for people with fibromyalgia.

A serious side effect of narcotics is addiction, but that problem rarely occurs
among people taking narcotics to alleviate their pain rather than to attain an
artificial high. The side effects that often do occur, however, are sedation,
nausea, dry mouth, and constipation.
At very high doses, such as those taken by patients with terminal cancer, nar-
cotics can cause considerable mental confusion or anxiety and may even
result in hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that aren’t really
there). They may also cause delusions (believing things that aren’t true) —
for example, that aliens have landed in the backyard, or the government has
planted secret listening devices in newspapers. Narcotic-induced hallucina-
tions and delusions cease when the dosages are decreased or the drugs are

Prescribing painkillers: The dilemma
For some people with fibromyalgia, their pain is constant and severe, and it
can only be made bearable by taking painkilling medications. Some people
with fibromyalgia say that their doctors are reluctant about prescribing any
painkilling medications, telling them to take regular Tylenol or ibuprofen if
they have pain. Others say that as long as the drug isn’t on the scheduled-
drug list, their doctor will give it to them.
Judy says that she could probably score cocaine easier than she could con-
vince her doctor to give her a prescription for Ultram (generic name: tra-
madol), a mild analgesic (painkiller) not even on the scheduled-drug list. And
she says that she knows she can totally forget about ever asking her doctor
for a scheduled drug. She tried once, and Judy says that the look of horror on
his face made it very clear where he stood in terms of prescribing narcotic
painkillers.
Many people with fibromyalgia find it degrading to plead and beg with their
doctors for painkillers. Even worse, if a doctor reluctantly provides a small
number of painkillers, the contrast between the relatively pain-free existence
and the return of the pain when the limited supply of pills is gone can be
maddening.
Tom says that his doctor prescribes narcotics that he can take when the pain
becomes severe, but his physician keeps a close watch on his dosage and
asks Tom plenty of questions, such as where the pain is, how bad it is, and so
forth. Tom is very careful about taking strong drugs, and he uses them only
for very bad pain. Otherwise, he relies on milder medications. Tom feels that
his doctor has just the right balance of compassion combined with careful
control.

Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Painkillers, particularly narcotics, are not drugs to take lightly, and any
doctor who does so isn’t the physician for you.
In my experience, the problem usually isn’t a doctor who dispenses painkillers
freely; instead, the opposite is usually the problem: Some doctors are resis-
tant to prescribing painkilling medications. Why are doctors often reluctant
to prescribe strong painkillers for relief of fibromyalgia-related pain?
 Doctors disagree on whether narcotics are effective at treating the
pain of fibromyalgia. Many doctors think that narcotics are usually inef-
fective; others think that they can relieve at least some of the severe pain.
 The side effects associated with narcotic painkillers concern many
doctors. (See the “Investigating controlled/scheduled drugs” section ear-
lier in this chapter.)
 Many doctors fear having to deal with law enforcement agencies. Law
enforcement agencies in many states are concerned about the abuse of
prescription medications, particularly of scheduled drugs. Drug abusers
don’t take scheduled drugs for pain control. They take them to attain an
artificial high, or because they’ve become addicted to the drug (often
because they originally took the drugs to get high). Sometimes, people
in severe pain also become addicted to painkillers if their physicians
don’t monitor them very carefully. Addiction to narcotics is more likely
to occur if you’re a smoker, or if you’ve had other addictions in the past
to substances such as alcohol or marijuana.
Drug abusers develop such an overwhelming need for the drug that they may
forge prescriptions, steal drugs from pharmacies, or buy them on the street.
These people are the ones whom law enforcement agencies are concerned
about.
Unfortunately, some patients with severe pain are the victims of overzealous
law enforcement and frightened physicians. Drug addicts and those who seek
illegal highs will find their drugs somewhere. Hurting patients who need legit-
imate pain relief don’t have that alternative, unless they’re willing to acquire
the medications illegally.
137
Chapter 10: Prescribing Health with Medications
Fighting pain with non-narcotic pills
Ultram (generic name: tramadol) is a non-
narcotic drug (not overseen by the Drug
Enforcement Administration) that’s effective at
alleviating pain for many people with fibromyal-
gia. Ultracet is a medication that combines
Ultram with Tylenol (acetaminophen). It’s not
clear exactly how these drugs work, but they
appear to work similarly to a narcotic drug in
inhibiting pain, although in a milder and less
dangerous way.

So what can you do if you’re in pain, but your doctor seems (or definitely is)
hesitant to prescribe narcotic painkilling medication? You can use several
tactics:
 Ask your doctor bluntly if she’s concerned that you’ll become addicted
to medication. Whether she says yes or no, you can point out that you’ve
never developed an addiction in the past. (If that’s true.)
 Tell your doctor that you’re seeking medication to combat pain, not to
go off on some sort of high.
 Give one or two examples of what your pain is preventing you from
doing. Maybe you can’t drive your children to soccer practice anymore,
even though it’s really important to you, because you’re hurting so bad.
Or perhaps you feel like a prisoner in your house because the pain is so
overwhelming.
If your candor and your examples don’t seem to matter, and your doctor
can’t or won’t give you a reason that makes sense to you for why she won’t
prescribe a painkiller, it’s probably time for you to read Chapter 7, my chap-
ter on how to find a new physician.
Lessening Pain with Lidoderm
A relatively new entry in the pharmaceutical arsenal against pain, Lidoderm
(generic name: lidocaine, 5 percent) is a transdermal skin patch that the
patient applies directly to the painful area after removing the protective back-
ing from the patch. Without its backing, the patch is very sticky and adheres
to the skin. The drug soothes muscles and can provide major pain relief to
many patients with fibromyalgia; the drug’s effects last for about 12 hours.
Up to three patches can be used on the body at the same time. The patches
are used 12 hours on, and then 12 hours off (no patches). The patch may
cause skin irritation in some patients, but many patients respond very well.
You can cut the patch into smaller strips if you don’t need the larger-size patch.
Reducing Inflammation with Non-
Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
Some individuals with fibromyalgia get significant pain relief by taking pre-
scribed or over-the-counter doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). The most commonly used drugs in this category are Naprosyn
(generic name: naproxen sodium), Feldene (generic name: piroxicam), Motrin
(ibuprofen), and Relafen (generic name: nabumetone).
138
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Some patients with fibromyalgia have also benefited from one of the more
recently introduced NSAIDs, which are called COX-2 inhibitors. Celebrex
(generic name: celecoxib) and Mobic (meloxicam) are medications in this cat-
egory. Note that other NSAIDs in the same class of medications as Celebrex,
such as Vioxx (generic name: rofecoxib) and Bextra (generic name: valde-
coxib), have been withdrawn from the market by their manufacturers
because of a possible risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart
attacks. You can’t get Vioxx or Bextra, but as of this writing, Celebrex and
Mobic are still options.
Celebrex and Mobic have the capability to reduce pain as well as stiffness
and inflammation, and when you have fibromyalgia, a drug that can attack all
these problems is certainly worthy of consideration. However, individuals
who are allergic to sulfa drugs (such as the antibiotic Septra) should not take
Celebrex.
NSAIDs generally are taken by fibromyalgia sufferers on a daily basis to
combat chronic pain, and they can be moderately effective. The primary
drawback to NSAID medications is that they can cause gastrointestinal upset,
which can sometimes be severe. For this reason, they should always be taken
with meals, and NSAIDs should never be taken on an empty stomach. In some
cases, NSAIDs can cause ulcers. Anyone who’s experiencing severe abdomi-
nal pain should stop taking her NSAID medication immediately and should
consult with her physician. Other side effects of NSAIDs may include rashes,
rapid heartbeat, stuffy nose, blurred vision, and lightheadedness.
Some people take over-the-counter medications, such as Tums or Rolaids,
along with their NSAID medication, to prevent stomach upset. Others make
sure that they only take the medication with food, and that action alone is
enough to alleviate the gastrointestinal distress that would occur if they took
the medication on an empty stomach. Celebrex is generally less likely to
cause gastrointestinal problems and is designed to be gentler on your stom-
ach. However, some individuals who take Celebrex still develop gastrointesti-
nal symptoms.
Many physicians recommend that Celebrex and Mobic be taken with meals —
even though you may not be given these instructions on your prescription
bottle — as you usually would with other prescribed NSAIDs. (Doctors like to
be extra careful.)
Fighting Fibromyalgia with
Antidepressants
Many people with fibromyalgia take one or more antidepressant medications.
These medications include
139
Chapter 10: Prescribing Health with Medications

 Adapin (generic name: doxepin)
 Cymbalta (generic name: duloxetine)
 Desyrel (generic name: trazodone)
 Effexor (generic name: venlafaxine)
 Elavil (generic name: amitriptyline)
 Lexapro (generic name: citalopram)
 Pamelor (generic name: nortriptyline)
 Paxil (generic name: paroxetine)
 Prozac (generic name: fluoxetine)
 Zoloft (generic name: sertraline)
Two common antidepressant medications used by people with FMS are Elavil
and Desyrel. In addition, a newer antidepressant, Cymbalta (generic name:
duloxetine), approved by the FDA in 2004 to treat depression, also provides
significant pain relief to many people with FMS. Cymbalta increases the levels
of both serotonin and norepinephrine, important neurochemicals that can
improve mood as well as decrease chronic pain. (For this reason, it is called a
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or SNRI; see the nearby sidebar.)
This medication may cause weight loss in some individuals.
I’m not depressed! Why do 
I need an antidepressant?
Some patients with fibromyalgia may have a problem with depression. But,
often, people with fibromyalgia are taking antidepressants not for depression
but rather for their fibromyalgia. Research has demonstrated that low doses
of some antidepressants, taken on a daily basis (or, rather, nightly because
most doctors recommend the drugs be taken in the evening), can help block
the pain of fibromyalgia or other chronic pain.
Sometimes, doctors prescribe two antidepressants at the same time for their
patients with fibromyalgia, hoping they’ll gain increased relief. For example,
in one clinical study, fibromyalgia patients were given both Elavil (25 mg) and
Prozac (20 mg). The result: A significant number of patients actually received
twice the pain relief with this combination than they gained with either drug
by itself. Although you may intuitively think that taking two drugs would logi-
cally give you about twice the relief as you’d receive from taking one medica-
tion, in actuality, that effect rarely happens. As a result, if and when research
140
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

shows such significant pain control, this fact makes researchers stand up and
pay attention. Of course, you should not take two different antidepressants
unless your doctor recommends it.
Balancing the pluses and minuses 
of antidepressants
The good news about using antidepressants to treat fibromyalgia pain is that
many antidepressants are relatively inexpensive, and most doctors will not
hesitate to prescribe these medications for the treatment of chronic-pain
problems. However, Cymbalta and some other antidepressants can be costly if
you don’t have medication coverage. In other words, you generally don’t need
to see a psychiatrist in order to receive a prescription for an antidepressant.
However, if you or your doctor thinks that you may actually have a severe
form of depression, you’re really better off consulting with a psychiatrist. Why?
Psychiatrists are the most knowledgeable physicians when it comes to anti-
depressants and other drugs that help people who have emotional problems.
141
Chapter 10: Prescribing Health with Medications
Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: 
A new pain remedy
Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
(SNRIs), particularly the drug Cymbalta
(generic name: duloxetine), are a new cate-
gory of antidepressants shown to be effective
in treating chronic pain. Cymbalta helps the
body retain two key neurochemicals (brain
chemicals, in this case, those affecting 
mood) — serotonin and norepinephrine —
and thus, it is not only effective at reducing
depression but also has demonstrated effec-
tiveness in reducing chronic pain, including
the chronic pain of fibromyalgia. Note that
another medication, Effexor (generic name:
venlafaxine), is also an SNRI, but the doses of
Effexor needed to reduce pain are usually high
and frequently cause side effects. Cymbalta is
FDA-approved to treat depression and the
nerve pain of diabetics; however, it is also
often prescribed off-label to treat the pain of
patients with FMS.
In a study of 354 female patients with
fibromyalgia (reported in the medical journal
Pain in 2005), 29 percent of the subjects who
received Cymbalta reported a 50 percent or
greater decrease in their pain levels. Some
patients dropped out of the study because of
side effects of nausea and dry mouth. (Such
side effects usually abate after several
weeks.) Other studies have indicated that
female patients with FMS have a significantly
greater improvement than males who take
Cymbalta, although the reasons for this are
unknown.

As with all medications, antidepressants have potential side effects:
 Constipation
 Diminished libido (sex drive) or complete lack of libido (Note: When that
effect occurs, it usually goes away when the drug is out of the system,
and normal libido will return.)
 Headaches or a “druggy” feeling
 Insomnia
 Upset stomach
 Weight gain or weight loss
Often (though not always), the initial side effects decrease or go away com-
pletely after the person’s body becomes more accustomed to the drug.
Other Medicines Prescribed 
for Fibromyalgia
A variety of other categories of drugs may also be very helpful in treating the
symptoms of fibromyalgia, particularly the symptom that probably bothers
142
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 
Talking about trigger-point injections
When your pain is severe and seems to be iso-
lated to one or several clearly defined areas,
some physicians consider using treatments of
trigger-point injections. These injections are
usually given directly into or near the zones
where the pain dominates. Often, patients with
fibromyalgia suffer from the trigger points of
myofascial pain syndrome (another pain syn-
drome; see Chapter 6). These trigger points (dif-
ferent from tender points) are painful, ropey areas
that the physician can actually feel during an
examination. Studies have shown that such injec-
tions are frequently helpful to patients with FMS.
Most doctors inject ropivacaine or lidocaine
into the area that’s the most painful. These
injections can be given several times per year,
and many patients with fibromyalgia gain con-
siderable pain relief from them. The injections
are usually given on an outpatient basis, and
they have only minor side effects, such as slight
bruising. If you experience any pain at the injec-
tion site, icing or heating the area usually pro-
vides relief. Some people may have an allergic
reaction to lidocaine injections, however.
The physician who injects the medication
should be a rheumatologist, anesthesiologist, or
neurologist, because these types of specialists
usually have the most experience with treating
both fibromyalgia and pain. An inexperienced
physician may be unable to identify trigger
points correctly or may inject medications into
the wrong areas.

you the most — the pain. Doctors may prescribe anticonvulsive drugs, anti-
anxiety drugs, and antihistamines for pain relief.
Analyzing anticonvulsive drugs
Some physicians prescribe anticonvulsive drugs to relieve the pain and ten-
derness of their FMS patients, even if those patients have never had a seizure
in their lives. Anticonvulsives can calm hyperactive pain fibers and effectively
reduce anxiety. The only way to know for sure whether such a drug works is
to take the medication and note its effects on you.
The key side effects of these drugs are that they may be very sedating and
they may also cause dry mouth and dizziness.
Anticonvulsives include such medications as Neurontin (generic name:
gabapentin), Lyrica (generic name: pregabalin), Topamax (generic name: top-
iramate), and Lamictal (generic name: lamotrigine). This drug class is one of
the most promising new therapies for fibromyalgia.
Pondering anti-anxiety medicines
Sometimes, anti-anxiety drugs can alleviate some symptoms of fibromyalgia.
Anxiety makes pain worse, so decreasing anxiety can be very helpful in pain
control. If the drugs work, you have relief from some symptoms of fibromyal-
gia, such as problems with sleeping. The drugs can also induce a level of
calmness to combat the high stress that many people suffering from
fibromyalgia experience.
Some anti-anxiety drugs are Valium (generic name: diazepam) and Xanax
(generic name: alprazolam). Both of these are scheduled drugs because of
their potential for addiction.
Some physicians may prescribe Klonopin (generic name: clonazepam).
Sometimes, the drug Restoril (generic name: temazepam) is prescribed for
patients with fibromyalgia. Other physicians may prescribe the antidepres-
sants Paxil (generic name: paroxetine) or Prozac (generic name: fluoxetine)
to treat anxiety.
Generally, low doses of anti-anxiety drugs are used to treat fibromyalgia.
However, some people with fibromyalgia need higher doses of anti-anxiety
drugs because their pain is strongly influenced by high levels of anxiety. (See
Chapter 16 for more information on emotional problems, such as anxiety and
depression, among people with fibromyalgia.)
143
Chapter 10: Prescribing Health with Medications

Anti-anxiety drugs can be highly sedating, and they may also cause night-
mares. Other side effects of these medications are dizziness and lightheaded-
ness. Of even greater concern, some anti-anxiety drugs may be habit forming,
particularly Xanax (generic name: alprazolam). As a result, they have the
potential to become addicting if not taken properly. (Habit-forming is a lower
level of addiction.)
Don’t take these drugs when you need to drive or operate equipment. Also,
keep in mind the fact that, after you start taking one of these medications,
you shouldn’t stop them without consulting your physician. The reason: If a
person who’s used to taking the drug suddenly stops taking it, he may suffer
from nausea/vomiting, racing heart beat, or other serious withdrawal effects.
Analyzing antihistamines
Although further research must be done, a few studies have indicated that
some antihistamines have mild analgesic (painkilling) qualities. Histamine is a
pain-promoting substance made by the body; antihistamine counteracts his-
tamine. For example, Atarax (generic name: hydroxyzine) provides some pain
relief, and it’s also mildly sedating.
Researchers in Denmark found a new antihistamine, ReN 1869, which
reduced inflammation and pain in laboratory mice, with no apparent ill
effects. They reported on their finding in a 2002 issue of the European
Journal of Pharmacology. It’ll be years before such antihistamines can be
used by humans (if they ever can). Still, such research is encouraging.
Considering pramipexole and ropinirole:
Parkinson’s drugs may offer pain relief
Some studies have indicated that two drugs that are technically called
dopamine receptor agonists and that are used by patients with Parkinson’s 
disease (a degenerative disease of the nervous system) may also be helpful 
in decreasing the chronic pain of individuals with FMS.
Mirapex (generic name: pramipexole) is a medication that works in a similar
way to dopamine and, thus, reduces the pain of fibromyalgia. In one study of
fibromyalgia patients reported in Arthritis & Rheumatism in 2005, 42 percent of
patients who took Mirapex reported that their pain decreased by at least 50
percent. About half of these patients had been taking narcotics or were dis-
abled by their pain. Common side effects were temporary anxiety and weight
loss. None of the patients withdrew from the study because of side effects.
Requip (generic name: ropinirole), another drug used to treat patients with
Parkinson’s disease, has also been found to be effective in reducing the pain
144
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

of fibromyalgia. In one study, nearly half of 30 patients taking Requip reported
a 50 percent or greater reduction of their pain. Side effects included nausea,
an increased risk for depression, agitation, and dizziness.
Opening Your Eyes to Sleep Remedies
If dark circles under your eyes and severe tiredness due to lack of sleep
accompany your other symptoms of fibromyalgia, you’re definitely not alone.
Most people with fibromyalgia have severe sleep problems. If you’re deprived
of the restorative qualities of a good night’s sleep and the opportunity for
your body to rest and recuperate from the day’s ordeals, this lack of sleep
can greatly worsen your symptoms of pain, muscle stiffness, and fatigue.
You can choose from many ways to cope with your sleep deficit, such as
using relaxation therapy or hypnosis or avoiding certain foods. (Read
Chapter 14 for more information on sleep and fibromyalgia, as well as tactics
for improving your sleep.) Medications can help, too.
Many medications described in this chapter, such as antidepressants, anti-
anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, and painkilling drugs, may cause drowsiness.
Some NSAIDs, prescribed for muscle pain and stiffness, may also cause some
individuals to feel drowsy. But sometimes, sleep-deprived people need a drug
specifically designed to cope with their sleep problems.
Ambien (generic name: zolpidem) is a commonly prescribed medication for
sleep difficulties. (Read more about Ambien and other sleep remedies in
Chapter 14 on dealing with sleep problems.) Other sleep remedies approved
by the FDA for insomniacs include Lunesta (generic name: eszoplicone) and
Sonata (generic name: zaleplon). These medications have a low risk for
abuse. A newer prescribed sleep remedy that is not a scheduled drug is
Rozarem (ramelteon).
Assessing whether sleep medication is needed
Only your doctor can decide whether a specific sleep remedy should be pre-
scribed. However, here are some indications that a sleep remedy may be
necessary:
 Sleeping less than five hours per night
 Frequently waking up at night (more than two to three times)
 Severe daytime drowsiness from lack of sleep
 Impairment from lack of sleep (stumbling about, frequent instances of
forgetfulness, inattentiveness), causing problems both at work and at
home
145
Chapter 10: Prescribing Health with Medications

Gazing at the ups and downs of sleep remedies
The most obvious benefit of a sleep remedy is that it induces or at least helps
you to attain some much-needed sleep. If you’re fully rested and your body
has had a chance to release hormones needed by a healthy body, such as
growth hormone (released during deep sleep) and others, your fibromyalgia
symptoms will likely improve as well.
Although sleep remedies can be a godsend for many people, they do have
some downsides. Ambien, although usually harmless, can cause continued
drowsiness and diarrhea in some people.
As with all drugs, doctors should carefully consider potential side effects
before prescribing a sleep remedy. Your doctor should also take into account
other medications that you’re already taking because, sometimes, drugs
interact with each other, boosting or weakening the effect of each other or
causing other reactions.
Pondering Future Remedies
Because so many people suffer from the symptoms of fibromyalgia, pharma-
ceutical companies are working very hard to develop medications that are
specifically effective for people with fibromyalgia. As a result, new and better
treatments should be available within the next few years or even sooner. So
hang on, if you’re dissatisfied with the medications that are available now.
Help is on its way.
As of this writing, research appears to be surging ahead in such areas as
growth hormones or dopamine receptor agonists. Some researchers have
already shown that growth hormone or dopamine receptor agonists have
improved the symptoms of some patients with fibromyalgia; further study is
needed, however. The key problem with growth hormone is that this particu-
lar therapy is very expensive, and until the price comes down further, it can’t
be widely used as a therapy for fibromyalgia patients.
Researchers are also working on the development of medications that are a triple
threat to FMS pain, inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and
dopamine. So far, these drugs have not been approved by the FDA and, thus, are
not available to the public, but look for this type of medication in the future.
I really can’t say exactly when drugs that are currently in the pipeline (that is,
in clinical testing) as of this writing will actually receive FDA approval and
become available to fibromyalgia patients down the road. Medications can’t
be prescribed for patients until they’ve been both thoroughly tested in clini-
cal trials and approved by the FDA to be sold to patients in the United States.
But probably within the next two to five years, FMS sufferers will have many
new choices to treat the pain, fatigue, and other symptoms of fibromyalgia.

hen you’re suffering from major pain, even the thought of a little
hands-on therapy can make you cringe or shudder. Nobody likes to be
touched when his body hurts, especially in those places right where the
body’s really hurting.
But sometimes, hands-on therapy can really help, whether the touching
comes from cold therapy, heat therapy, massage therapy, transcranial mag-
netic therapy (TMS), or, in some cases, from special machines that act to
stimulate and relax the tender areas.
In this chapter, I provide basic information about these hands-on techniques,
including how they work, why they work, what to watch out for, and how
these different options may just help you reduce the pain of your fibromyal-
gia syndrome (FMS).
Heating Up the Problem: Heat Therapy
Heat therapy is, hands-down, the most preferred local therapy for body
aches by most FMS patients, and it may work effectively for you when you’re
in a lot of pain and need some relief right now.

Heat helps by getting your blood flowing to the painful area and by speeding
up the healing process. Heat relaxes stiff muscles and improves circulation,
thus easing your pain. As a result, heat that’s applied to the painful area may
be effective in decreasing (although probably not entirely eliminating) your
underlying pain.
Heat is most often best for chronic pain, such as with the aches usually ex-
perienced by people with FMS; cold seems to work better for acute pain and
inflammation. So if you’re experiencing chronic pain, try heat first. But if it
doesn’t work for you, try cold next.
Carole, who’s had fibromyalgia for ten years, says that two things — hot
baths and massage therapy — have really given her significant relief from her
fibromyalgia symptoms.
Delivering the heat
Even something as simple as a hot bath or shower or lying down on an inex-
pensive heating pad (turned to the low or medium setting) may provide you
with a major pain decrease.
Dry heat (such as a heating pad or a hot, dry towel) or wet heat (a hot, wet
cloth or steam heat) — which is better? Sometimes, dry heat may be the best
answer for you, and at other times, moist heat (using hot, wet towels or
standing in a steamy shower) may ease your pain more effectively. Predicting
which method — wet or dry heat — will work better for you can be hard,
and, sometimes, you may need to try one and then, if it’s not working, go
ahead and try the other.
Some gel packs can be heated in the microwave oven and then applied to the
skin. Be sure to carefully read the instructions on any such product that you
buy. You may be the kind of person who hates reading instruction manuals —
many people are — but force yourself to read the basic information anyway,
and don’t risk experimenting on yourself. (If you don’t, you could get the
pack too hot and burn yourself, or the pack could explode if left in the
microwave too long!)
Avoiding overheating
Be sure that you don’t overheat the painful areas of your body. No pain, no
gain is an old saying that absolutely does not apply to fibromyalgia. The heat
may be mildly discomforting, at most, but it shouldn’t be painfully burning.
148
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Second- or third-degree burns won’t help your condition. But even if the item
that you’re using doesn’t get to that level of heat, excessive heat can result in
a serious flare-up in your fibromyalgia symptoms and your pain. Avoid it.
If you’re using a heating pad, it almost certainly has a temperature control.
Use it. Set it to a low or medium setting. If no temperature control is available
because you’re using hot towels that you may have boiled or that came
straight from the dryer, test the temperature by touching it quickly. If your
first response when you touch the hot towel is to spring back with an “Ouch!”
then it’s too hot for you.
Let the hot item cool down a little bit more before you think about applying it
to your body. And then test it again with your hand before you lie on the hot
towel or heating pad. After all, this therapy isn’t called “burning therapy.”
Chilling Out! Icing the Pain
You don’t have to go live with the penguins to get some ice-cold pain relief.
Cryotherapy (also known as “cold therapy”) uses cold to dull or weaken your
agitated nerve endings in the area being iced, making it harder for the pain
signals to reach your brain. Cryotherapy also slows the blood flow to the
affected area, decreasing inflammation and pain. However, you have to be
careful. Try treating a small pain area first. Because many FMS patients are
very sensitive to cold (they often find it downright painful), you must weigh
the benefits as well as the drawbacks. Cold therapy may be helpful for your
sore body areas but only if it is not painful!
Cryotherapy can be as close to you as your very own kitchen. Frozen water
that comes from your freezer (otherwise known by its technical term, ice)
can work very well for your personal cold therapy. Fancy ice packs and
simple plastic bags filled with ice cubes can both do the job. Another option
is to use a plastic package of frozen vegetables, straight from your freezer.
Be sure to place a clean washcloth or towel over your sore area and then
place the ice over that. Avoid directly icing the painful area so you won’t risk
causing damage to the skin. Don’t leave ice packs on for any longer than
about 20 to 30 minutes at a time, or you can harm your skin (even when you
use the towel). Set your timer or keep your eye on your watch, and play it
safe. You don’t want to add frostbite to your list of symptoms resulting from
your fibromyalgia.
If you want something more advanced than a bag of frozen peas, you can
make your own ice applicator very easily and inexpensively. Simply fill a
paper cup with water (about three-fourths full because ice expands) and then
freeze it. When you want to use cryotherapy, just peel down the sides of the
top of the cup and then use the rest of the cup as your applicator — similar
to the way that you use a roll-on deodorant.
149
Chapter 11: Using Hands-On Therapies

The pain relief from cold therapy is usually temporary, lasting several hours
at most. However, when you’re in severe pain from a flare-up of your
fibromyalgia, even a mere few hours of relief is a worthwhile goal.
If you suffer from frequent headaches, as many people with fibromyalgia do,
try this simple remedy: Place an ice pack on the back of your neck for about
20 minutes. This cold can often help block the pain pathway, confusing the
neurochemical pain messengers. Most important, it may relieve your
headache.
Wetting Down Your Fibromyalgia
Symptoms
Water can often improve your symptoms from fibromyalgia. Hydrotherapy, or
using water exercises in a pool as a form of therapy, is an effective means to
relieve fibromyalgia pain. It also often helps considerably in improving your
other symptoms such as a lack of sleep. A study of 50 FMS patients reported
in Sleep Medicine in 2006 placed patients in two groups, one receiving
hydrotherapy and the other receiving conventional physical therapy. The
hydrotherapy subjects did warm-ups, stretching, aerobic exercises, and relax-
ation. Their warm-ups included walking forward, backward, and sideways in
the pool. All the patients in the hydrotherapy group increased their total
sleep time by at least an hour, a significant improvement compared to the
physical-therapy group.
You may also find relief from whirlpool baths or simple walking around in a
pool (also called “water walking”).

Gelling the pain
You can purchase gel packs, which are plastic
containers that are filled with a gelatinous sub-
stance. They can be frozen and applied to the
painful area. Some gel packs are also enclosed
in cloth. They come in many different sizes as
well as a broad range of prices. You can find
these gel packs in pharmacies or department
stores, or buy them from companies that sell
products over the Internet.
Gel packs are generally inexpensive and
reusable. Some gel packs are designed for
freezing only, but others may be frozen or
heated in your microwave oven, so that they
can be used for dual therapy. Use these packs
for cold therapy or heat therapy, depending on
your needs.

Because both water and warmth can make you feel better, why not soak in a
hot tub or spa? This choice can be a questionable one for people with
fibromyalgia because the water is often uncomfortably hot (although it
should never be hotter than 104°F) and can exacerbate your symptoms. But
worse than that, soaking in a hot tub (especially for an extended period) can
have a dangerously sedating effect, particularly when you’re taking pain medi-
cations, sleep remedies, or other drugs. Some people have actually drowned
in their own hot tubs when they decided to soak alone.
If you use a hot tub, make sure that the temperature is set at a tolerable level
before you enter the tub. It’s also important to enter the tub slowly. You don’t
want to leap into hot water any more than you’d want to plunge your whole
hand into a boiling pot on your stove. Limit the amount of time that you
remain in the tub to no more than 15 minutes. Also, be sure that someone
else is at home with you when you use the hot tub — preferably, in the tub
with you.
Rubbing Out the Problem: 
Massage Therapy
Except when you’re in excruciating pain, massage therapy is a treat! A mild
massaging of your aching muscles and other tender areas of your body can
be helpful, whether the massage is performed by a professional massage
therapist or by your loving partner or a friend. (A professional is preferable,
if you can afford it or, even better, if your health insurance covers it.)
If no one’s available to provide you with a massage, you may choose to use a
mechanical massager. Be sure to set such devices to the low or medium set-
ting to start with. The high cycle may be far too vigorous for a person with
fibromyalgia. And read the instructions on the device before you apply it to
your body.
Sometimes, either heat or cold therapy is combined with massage therapy in
an attempt to amplify the relief that’s provided. For example, you may lie on a
heating pad while the massage is being provided. Or you can take a hot bath
at home and have your partner provide you with a gentle massage afterward.
Realizing that it’s not a cure, 
but it can be helpful
A gentle to medium massage treatment can’t cure you of your fibromyalgia,
but it may ease your pain for a few hours or even a day or so. When it works,
151
Chapter 11: Using Hands-On Therapies

massage can stimulate the production of endorphins, natural pain chemicals
that travel to the hurting parts of your body and provide relief — somewhat
like soldiers in the cavalry, rushing in to help the besieged troops at the fort.
But these endorphins only stay in the bloodstream for so long. Massage ther-
apy clearly can be very useful for some people who have fibromyalgia, but
it’s a therapy that needs to be repeated on a regular basis in order to con-
tinue the benefit. Massage may be exactly what you need to get you through
these challenging periods when the pain is strong but you need to keep
going.
A study of the effects of massage on the painful areas of people with FMS
(reported in a 1999 issue of the European Journal of Pain) revealed that sub-
jects who received 15 massage sessions over ten weeks received significant
pain relief. In fact, the 23 people in the treatment group who received mas-
sage therapy were able to reduce their use of painkilling medications.
However, the improvement for the fibromyalgia subjects who felt better from
massage was only a temporary reprieve, and six months after the treatments
ended, most of the pain had returned again.
Diana is a long-term fibromyalgia sufferer, and she’s also a major massage-
therapy fan. She says that massage has been such a godsend in keeping her
from completely stiffening up. But not everyone feels so positively about
massage and its value. Lauren, another person who’s had FMS for years, says
that massage therapy has helped her somewhat, but she also warns that mas-
sage is extremely short-term help. She says that she’d really need to live with
a massage therapist in order for it to be both affordable and realistic for her.
Because that’s obviously not practical, she’s foregoing massage therapy.
Finding a massage therapist
Interested in finding a good massage therapist, but not quite sure where to
begin to look for one? You can try starting with the Yellow Pages of your local
phone book, but that’s usually not the best place to begin your search. Why
not? Because such a cursory search can’t give you the opportunity for some
preliminary screening options, like the kind you’ll get when you ask your
doctor, friends, and others for recommendations. Also, the therapist with the
biggest advertisement in the phone book isn’t necessarily the best one —
although he may be.
Asking around
Here are a few ideas to get you started in identifying a massage therapist:
152
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

 Ask your physician if she can recommend anyone who performs mas-
sage therapy, or if she knows anyone else who may be able to recom-
mend someone. Also, ask your doctor’s nurses if they know of anyone
who performs massage therapy.
 Ask your friends and co-workers if they can recommend a massage ther-
apist. Depending on your friends, this question may get you a little — or
maybe a lot of — teasing.
 Contact fitness centers in the area. Often, members who are into exer-
cising big time also enjoy receiving massages for their aching muscles.
Another way to locate a massage therapist in your own backyard is to con-
tact the American Massage Therapy Association, a national organization of
therapists. If you live in the United States, you can call them toll-free at
877-905-2700. If you’re not a U.S. resident or simply prefer the Internet, you
can go to their Web site (www.amtamassage.org) to search for a local mas-
sage therapist.
Screening the therapist
After you find some candidates, what next? If your state requires professional
licensing, as many states do, ask the massage therapist if she’s licensed. And
ask to see the license if you do go for an appointment — just to be safe.
(People who are actually licensed are very proud of that fact. They’re not hesi-
tant to show you the license, and most of them have it on display on the wall.)
Ask the following questions to the massage therapist you’re considering,
adding your own questions to this list of suggestions:
 Have you treated people with fibromyalgia before? If you get a blank
look or complete silence, that’s not a good sign. Move on to someone
else who is at least familiar with the term.
If the therapist says he has treated people with FMS before, ask him to
describe the treatment that he provided. Also, about how many times
did those patients receive massages? (You’re looking to find out whether
this therapist has had any repeat/satisfied customers who have
fibromyalgia.)
 Do you believe in very vigorous massages only? If the answer is yes,
that’s the wrong answer for the person with fibromyalgia. Some people
gain some benefit by having their bodies pummeled. You won’t, and
extremely vigorous massage may cause your pain and other symptoms
to flare up.
153
Chapter 11: Using Hands-On Therapies

 Are you associated with a doctor, chiropractor, or other medical pro-
fessional in the area? The massage therapist may have her own busi-
ness, but most have some sort of relationship, even if not a financial
one, with a medical professional. If the person says that she works with
patients of Dr. Smith, call Dr. Smith’s office and find out whether he’s
ever heard of her.
 Is your service covered by health insurance? Maybe nobody in your
area is covered, but this question is still worth asking. Also, you may be
pleasantly surprised and find out that your insurance company actually
will pay for a part of the therapy.
Not everyone can tolerate massage therapy, even when it’s gentle. Louise,
who has had FMS for several years, works part-time as a massage therapist
herself, but she says that massage has actually made her fibromyalgia much
worse. Louise has completely given up on this form of therapy for herself.
She knows that massage therapy helps some people a great deal, but for her,
it just doesn’t work.
Forming a non-aggression pact 
with your massage therapist
Be sure to make it very clear to anyone who massages your muscles —
whether that person is your partner, a friend, or a trained massage therapist
or physical therapist — that he must take it slower and easier with you than
he normally would with people who don’t have fibromyalgia. You absolutely
don’t want an aggressive form of massage therapy.
The reason: When people with FMS get a very active and painful massage,
that massage can be a self-defeating experience that results in a flare-up of
pain. You may end up feeling much worse when you leave than you did when
you came in.
If the therapist can’t comply with your request for a gentle massage, ask the
facility for another person to provide your massage. Or you may want to just
“vote with your feet” and go someplace else.
If your therapist asks whether you want the Swedish massage or the deep-
tissue massage, choose the Swedish one because it’s the gentle massage
option.
If the massage therapist tells you that the massage may result in a little bruis-
ing, do not proceed! Any massage that causes tissue damage is a very bad
idea for a person with fibromyalgia (and not such a great idea for a person
who doesn’t have FMS).
154

Never allow anyone to walk on your back. Doing so can cause serious damage
as well as long-lasting pain.
Magnetically Decreasing Your Pain:
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
Simple magnets don’t provide much relief to people with fibromyalgia. But
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may provide significant hands-on
relief, although research is still actively ongoing and TMS is not yet officially
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any medical disor-
ders. TMS is an experimental therapy, and is only available now at major
medical-research centers or in clinical trials. It is primarily used to treat long-
standing and resistant depression, but some very preliminary research indi-
cates that TMS may help people with fibromyalgia, too. Read on.
What it is and how it works
TMS is the use of powerful magnets targeting the brain’s cortex. A surface
coil is applied to the scalp, and it generates magnetic fields, which in turn
create electrical currents that travel to the brain. Nerve cells that are related
to mood are stimulated, which can improve mood and may decrease chronic
pain. You may feel as though you’re hearing a tapping noise during the treat-
ment, which lasts about 30 minutes.
Slow-frequency and repetitive TMS has been demonstrated effective in
decreasing the pain of fibromyalgia in a tiny sample of four women, published
in a 2006 issue of Pain Medicine.
155
Chapter 11: Using Hands-On Therapies
No shoes, no shirt, service
Don’t assume that you’ll need to go totally naked
to receive massage therapy, although if you’re
having a full-body massage, you may need to
strip down. Your body will be draped, and only
the part that the therapist is working on will be
uncovered. In most cases, the uncovered area
doesn’t include any erogenous zones, such as
women’s breasts or the genitals of men or
women. Instead, you usually keep on your
underwear, and the areas not being massaged
(such as your upper or lower torso) are covered
with a sheet or a towel. If the therapist tells you
that you must strip and you don’t want to, simply
refuse. You may have inadvertently stumbled
into the wrong type of massage facility.

The procedure may cause a mild headache and some numbness and tingling
at the site where the coil was placed. However, if significant pain relief
occurs, such side effects are well worth it!
Who should avoid TMS
Some individuals should definitely avoid TMS treatment, including people
who fit the following categories:
 Those with chronic migraines
 Those who have had brain surgery
 Those with a family history of epilepsy or seizures
 Pregnant women
 People with cardiac pacemakers or other electronic devices
156
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 
If your partner provides the massage
Suppose that you can’t afford a professional
massage therapist, or just don’t want to for some
reason. But your very own loving partner is ready
and willing to give you a back rub or to massage
other sore parts. Should you let her provide a
much-needed massage, even if she has no train-
ing? That question is really up to you.
If you decide that the answer is yes, follow
some simple guidelines, provided here. Also
remember that an adult should perform the
massaging. Don’t expect your child or teenager
to give you regular massages. Placing a child in
such an adult role is unfair.
 Be sure to tell your partner before any mas-
saging starts that a little discomfort is
normal when painful areas are probed. But
if it really hurts, it’s time to immediately cease
and desist with massaging that body part.
 Tell your partner to keep the massage brief.
He’ll probably tire fairly quickly anyway, but
try to go for 15 to 20 minutes max.
 Advise your partner to provide a light and
nonbruising massage. The key is “non-
painful.”
 If your partner massages your body with
electric devices, be cautious. Always start
on the low end of the machine’s capabili-
ties. You probably won’t be able to tolerate
the high levels.

An Electrifying Solution: Transcutaneous
Electrical Nerve Stimulation
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a machine-based ther-
apy that’s designed to deliver low-level electrical impulses to body areas that
are in pain or spasm. The goal is to stimulate the nerve tissue to naturally
release pain-fighting body chemicals. This treatment is used to help people
with fibromyalgia, arthritis, and other medical conditions.
Although few clinical studies have backed up the usefulness of TENS, some
people report that they gain relief from this treatment. TENS is a noninvasive
form of therapy that may work as well for you as it has for others.
TENS therapy is usually not used in isolation; instead, it’s combined with
other pain-relieving techniques or with medications. You may also want to use
periodic heat- or cold-therapy or massage along with your TENS treatments.
The working theory behind TENS
Here’s the basic theory to explain why TENS may help people who experi-
ence chronic pain: When painful areas of the body are directly stimulated
with regular bursts of a very mild electrical current over a short time, these
hurting areas of your body are thought to respond to this electrical stimula-
tion by releasing endorphins (pain-reducing chemicals in the brain).
These pain-busting chemicals, now thoroughly aroused to action by the
external electrical stimulation of the TENS equipment, theoretically rush to
the rescue, eventually causing a reduction in both your pain and muscle stiff-
ness. Believers in TENS therapy also think that the stimulated area isn’t the
only part of the body that responds to the therapy, but that the brain itself
also reacts to these periodic electrical impulses, and the end result is dimin-
ished pain.
What happens during therapy
The physical therapist — or whoever’s administering the TENS therapy to
you — will apply special small patches with electrodes to your skin directly
on the particular areas of your body that are bothering you the most. These
patches are connected by wires to a TENS machine. The machine delivers
regular, periodic, and painless pulses of electricity (about 80 to 100 low-level
pulses per second). Sessions typically last about an hour.
157
Chapter 11: Using Hands-On Therapies

You usually need a calibration in the first treatment, during which the opera-
tor will send signals of varying intensity to you to determine when you start
to feel anything. People vary in how strong a signal they need; a signal that’s
weak to other people may be just right or even too strong for you. The goal is
for you to feel the electrical impulse but not feel any pain from it.
During the session, you merely lie or sit down and have your painlessly elec-
trifying experience. Don’t worry — TENS therapy is nothing like the jolt from
a cattle probe or some other painful electrical device, nor is it anywhere near
as unsafe. In fact, the electrical impulses emitted by TENS are completely
painless. Some people fall asleep during the treatment.
Doing TENS to yourself
Some people purchase or rent portable TENS units, so that they can receive
the treatment at home. Your insurance company may be willing to reimburse
you for this expense, but you should be sure to check ahead of time before
you spend your own money.
The insurance company may have limitations on how much money it’ll reim-
burse you or what types of equipment it’ll approve. It would be a shame if you
bought your TENS unit from a particular company, not knowing that your
insurance company will only pay for a TENS device from some other company.
The main benefits of having a TENS unit at home are that you won’t have to
drive to you doctor’s office or physical therapist’s office to receive treat-
ments, and you can manage the treatment yourself in the privacy of your
home. You can also arrange to have the treatments during a time that’s con-
venient for you, rather than when you can manage to get an appointment.
The downside of using a TENS unit is that you’re probably not trained in this
therapy, and you’ll have only the written manual that accompanies the unit to
go by. If you experience any problems or discomfort, you won’t know if it’s
normal or abnormal.
Another disadvantage is that TENS units come from many different manufac-
turers, and deciding which unit is really the best one for you can be difficult.
Some units may be hard on the pocketbook, especially if your health-insurance
company gives you the thumbs down on reimbursing you for the cost of the
unit.
158
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Considering Chiropractors
Many people with arthritis or fibromyalgia find small to considerable relief at
the hands of a chiropractor, a practitioner who manipulates the bones and
muscle tissues in an effort to relieve pain and stiffness. A chiropractor is not
a medical doctor; instead, a chiropractor is a licensed professional who’s
received specialized training regarding the bones and nervous system.
Chiropractors operate in nearly all states, and many insurance companies
provide at least partial medical coverage for their treatments. You may need
to get approval from your insurance company before the chiropractic treat-
ment may begin, so be sure to check first.
Although most chiropractors are well aware of the need for gentleness when
treating FMS patients, if you consult with a chiropractor, you may want to
remind him that you need to go slow and easy before any treatment begins.
After your diagnosis of FMS has been made by the chiropractor, or she has
been informed by you or your doctor that you have fibromyalgia, you should
receive a plan of treatment. Massage therapy is often an integral part of the
treatment plan of most chiropractors for treating many different medical
problems.
Tell the chiropractor about any other medical problems that you may have in
addition to your fibromyalgia, such as arthritis, heart disease, osteoporosis,
and so forth. This information is important to help tailor your treatment,
guiding the chiropractor to go more easily in areas of the body that may be
weak.
159
Chapter 11: Using Hands-On Therapies
Bedding down in comfort
Some experts say that your choice in bedding is
very important when you have FMS. Because
you’re prone to pain, you may need a special
mattress cover like an egg crate or one made of
lambs wool or a material that breathes (you
don’t want to become sweaty at night and make
the whole problem worse) and provides extra
padding at night. Most people with fibromyalgia
have problems sleeping at night, so a comfort-
able bed is very important.

Be sure to ask the chiropractor the following questions, to which you should
add any other questions relevant in your particular case:
 About how many treatments per week will I need? The chiropractor
should be willing to answer this question without any hesitation,
although she may say “about two or three,” or “about four or five,” or
some other approximation.
 About how many weeks of treatment will I need? You may have a more
difficult time getting an answer to this particular question, but ask it
anyway. To be fair, the chiropractor can’t really know how many treat-
ments you may need at the beginning of treatment. But he should be
able to give you at least a guesstimate. Of course, because fibromyalgia
is a chronic illness, treatments will usually be ongoing. More treatments
are usually needed at the onset of treatment.
 About how many treatments will it take for me to know whether the
therapy is working? This question is another tough one for the chiro-
practor to answer at the beginning. But ask anyway. You need to know
for your own planning. For example, if the chiropractor plans to treat
you for six months or longer, but you don’t ask and merely assume that
treatment will take a month or so, eventually you’ll be dissatisfied. It’s
better to know upfront what may be expected down the road.
 What can I hope to get from this treatment? If the chiropractor
promises you immediate and/or complete relief from your fibromyalgia
with her treatments, watch out. Most ethical chiropractors will hope to
give you significant relief and improvement in your pain problem, but
they won’t give you guarantees that you’ll be cured.
In addition, make sure that you see the chiropractor’s state license. It should
be prominently displayed, along with his college degrees and other credentials
that are up on the wall. If you can’t find the state license on the wall, ask to
see it.

M
illions of people rely on alternative remedies and treatments to help
them with their chronic ailments, and patients with fibromyalgia syn-
drome (FMS) are even more frequent users of alternative therapies. A study
of 13,792 patients with fibromyalgia (reported in a 2007 issue of Arthritis &
Rheumatism) revealed that 56 percent had used some form of alternative
medicine, compared to 21 percent of the 41,427 people in the control group
who didn’t have fibromyalgia. So, if you’ve tried one or more forms of alterna-
tive medicine to ease your symptoms of FMS, you’re definitely not alone!
Whether alternative therapies come in the form of herbs and supplements,
acupuncture, Botox injections, or another alternative solution, many people
with fibromyalgia fervently hope that they’ll work. Sometimes, people find
that these remedies work very well — or at least seem to.
Other people have spent their hard-earned dollars on what turned out to be
ridiculous remedies. They may have known or suspected that these remedies
would never work, even when they purchased them. But they felt so bad and
urgently craved some relief. When you’re in major pain and you can’t sleep,
and a late-night infomercial is advertising some Super-Fabulous Pain Relief
Stuff with Grapefruit Peel Essence, you may think, “What if it actually works?
After all, the guy in the infomercial feels great!”

Bonnie is one person who’s fallen for some phony cure-alls. She says that
she’s tried coffee enemas, and has spent thousands of dollars on supple-
ments, all of which ended up in the trash. Bonnie says that all the purveyors

wrong.
Don’t count out alternative remedies altogether. This chapter helps you sepa-
rate alternative therapies that work — or may work — from snake-oil solu-
tions that you don’t want to spend your money on. When studies are
available to back up a form of treatment, I briefly describe them. If a particu-
lar alternative remedy has no clinical studies so far, I discuss the treatment
from a logical viewpoint.
For further information on alternative medicine, go to the Web site of the

supplements, herbs, and other choices.
Thinking Through Alternative Remedies
How can you know if an alternative remedy — whether it’s an herb or supple-
ment, acupuncture, or another therapy not considered “mainstream” by your
doctors — may help you combat your fibromyalgia symptoms?
Here are some basic questions to ask yourself about an alternative therapy
(whatever it may be) before you try it:
 Does the promoter promise that this remedy is an instant cure? If the
answer is “yes,” this response is a red flag. Fibromyalgia has no quick
fixes. Maybe one will be found someday, but it’s not here yet.
 Do you know anyone who has gained relief from this remedy? If so,
how long has he tried it? Often, what seems to work wonderfully for a
week or two proves useless in the end. Often, however, the desire to get
better can be so strong that, sometimes, people believe a new remedy
will really work, and they actually feel better. This placebo effect usually
wears off after a while, though.
 Is the person promoting the remedy also selling it? She may be a true
proponent, but when she has a financial incentive, think harder before
buying the remedy.
 Have any recent studies been done on this therapy? If so, were they
performed by medical doctors on at least 100 subjects? Read the
abstract (summary) of the study. You can read medical abstracts for free
on PubMed, the National Library of Medicine’s database at www.
ncbi.nih.gov/entrez.

 Is this therapy safe? What risks are involved? If the person promoting
the therapy says that the therapy has no risks whatsoever, be skeptical.
Whatever therapy you try most likely has at least some risk, even if it’s
minimal. You need upfront knowledge of side effects and risks, even if
they’re unlikely to occur.
 How much is this therapy or treatment going to cost you, and how
long will it last? The price of a remedy that may be iffy, and how lasting
its effects will be, should both be key factors in your decision whether to
try a therapy or forego it.
 Would this remedy interact with other drugs that your doctor has pre-
scribed? Also, would your doctor disapprove of it? The best way to
find out is to ask your physician. (She may surprise you, and say that
the treatment’s a good idea.)
Fighting Fibromyalgia Naturally 
with Herbs and Supplements
Can taking herbs or supplements make you feel better? When it comes to
fibromyalgia, most clinical studies don’t show significant effects. Keep in
mind, however, that all herbs and supplements can have adverse effects on
your health by interacting with other medications you take or by worsening
medical problems that you already have, so always consult with your doctor
first before taking any herb or supplement.
Don’t forget that you can also combat FMS in more conventional ways. Be
sure to read Chapter 9 on over-the-counter remedies that may help you
resolve your fibromyalgia symptoms. Read Chapter 10 to find out about pre-
scribed drugs that may help you.
Notifying your doctor about 
your natural choices
Studies have indicated that many people who decide to try herbal remedies
or supplements never discuss that choice with their doctors. Maybe they
forget to mention it when they see their physicians. Maybe they (wrongly)
assume that all “natural” remedies are somehow automatically safe and,
therefore, they don’t need to tell the doctor about them. Or, maybe they’re
afraid that the doctor will tell them they should stop taking it.
163
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Remedies and Treatments

Whatever the reason, it’s important to overcome this qualm and inform your
doctor of alternative remedies you’re taking — or even thinking of taking.
Some herbal remedies or supplements can interact significantly with other
medications, boosting or diminishing their effects.
Don’t get your medical advice from clerks working in health-food stores (no
matter how knowledgeable they may sound), and don’t rely solely on infor-
mation provided on the label of a supplement or herb that the store is selling.
Always check with your physician first before taking any alternative medica-
tion to ensure that it’s safe for you.
Looking at magnesium
Everyone needs magnesium, and most people obtain this vital element in
their everyday diet. However, some people are slightly (or very) deficient in
magnesium, and this deficiency can lead to serious muscle pain and other
symptoms. Magnesium deficiencies have also been associated with migraine
headaches and other medical problems.
Some people take magnesium only (as opposed to combinations of magne-
sium along with other supplements). Some studies have shown that people
who experience migraines and other pain syndromes may have a shortage of
magnesium. Even if a person’s blood-test levels of magnesium come back as
“normal,” that person may have a subclinical (slightly below-normal) level of
an element. If you’re subclinically deficient in magnesium, that shortage could
be enough of a problem to contribute to your symptoms of fibromyalgia.
Magnesium supplements are easy to find — they’re available in pharmacies,
supermarkets, health-food stores, and online. Be sure to check the recom-
mended dosage on the bottle, as well as with your physician. If you take mag-
nesium supplements, keep in mind that magnesium is included in many
over-the-counter heartburn remedies, such as Mylanta. If you have a stom-
achache and take such a drug, you may want to cut back on your daily dose
of magnesium.
Avoid overdoing your magnesium intake, whether you’re taking a magnesium
combination or supplement. Too much magnesium can lead to a shortage of
potassium or other minerals that you need. You don’t want to unnecessarily
create new medical problems while you’re trying to resolve your fibromyalgia
symptoms. Be sure to take only the dose that your doctor advises.
You may also find that magnesium causes looser stools or may bring on
actual diarrhea. Of course, if you have a problem with chronic constipation
that accompanies your fibromyalgia, as with some people who have irritable
bowel syndrome, then magnesium may seem like a dream drug to you. It may
ease your muscle pain, and also make it possible to have a normal bowel
movement. If you’re in that situation, what could be better?

Evaluating valerian
Valerian is an herbal remedy that some people take to alleviate their insom-
nia. (Read more about valerian and its potential impact on overcoming sleep
difficulties in Chapter 14.) Valerian may act as a natural anti-anxiety drug as
well. Some people take valerian for headaches.
According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine (NCCAM), there is insufficient evidence to know if valerian really
works; however, it is generally safe to use for four to six weeks.
This herb may cause stomachaches, headaches, dizziness, or fatigue. If you
decide to take valerian for insomnia or anxiety (or both), follow the direc-
tions on the bottle. Try this herbal remedy for the first time in the evening or
at another time when you won’t need to drive a car, operate equipment, or do
anything else that requires alertness — just in case valerian makes you
sleepy.
You can find valerian in many pharmacies and supermarkets, as well as in
health-food stores or online.
Watching out for dangerous remedies
Some natural remedies can be extremely dangerous, particularly some drugs
that purport to help you lose weight but that are primarily comprised of
highly stimulating drugs (such as ephedra, also known as ma huang). The
effects of such drugs are similar to the action of an excessive level of the hor-
mone adrenaline. These drugs may act like a nonprescription amphetamine
drug, speeding up your metabolism to dangerous or even fatal levels.
In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of any sup-
plements containing ephedrine alkaloids, which are found in plants such as
ephedra, Sida cordifolia, and Pinellia. However, prescribed drugs containing
chemically synthesized ephedrine — including drugs used for the treatment
of allergic reactions, asthma, or bronchitis — are not included in this ban.
Other supplements can cause adverse effects and should be avoided by some
patients altogether. For example, Ginkgo biloba thins the blood, and people
who also take blood thinners, such as Coumadin (generic name: warfarin),
should not take this substance. Gingko biloba should never be taken by
anyone before having surgery or a medical procedure.
Of course, women who are pregnant or think they may be pregnant should
not take any supplements without first checking with their obstetrician. Many
drugs that are generally safe, including over-the-counter remedies and sup-
plements, can be dangerous to a developing fetus.

Pinning Down a Solution: Acupuncture
Some people with fibromyalgia announce feeling considerable relief after
undergoing acupuncture, the careful insertion of special pins at specific points
of the body by a trained practitioner. Others, however, have said that
acupuncture had no effect on them, and some have reported that the experi-
ence made them feel worse.
Several key clinical studies on acupuncture have shown that acupuncture is
effective against the pain of fibromyalgia. For example, in a study on
fibromyalgia patients reported in 2006 in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the
researchers placed 25 of the patients in the acupuncture group and 25 in the
control group receiving simulated acupuncture. The researchers found that
the symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, and pain were significantly reduced in the
acupuncture group compared to the control group. It’s worth noting that
some studies find that patients don’t obtain significant relief from their FMS
symptoms with acupuncture.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 2
million people per year in the United States use acupuncture as a therapy.
Acupuncture therapy may or may not be covered by your health insurance,
so check ahead of time to find out. If your health-insurance company does
cover acupuncture treatments, keep in mind that your acupuncture sessions
are far more likely to be covered when the person performing the acupunc-
ture is a medical doctor, osteopathic physician, or nurse practitioner.

Getting some help that your taxes paid for
The FDA offers many helpful tips on dietary sup-
plements, and basics to consider before taking
these drugs, in their online publication, “Tips for
the Savvy Supplement User: Making Informed
Decisions and Evaluating Information.” You can
read this publication online at http://vm.

Understanding acupuncture
The Chinese have explanations about acupuncture that are fairly complicated
and may make little sense to the Western mind. So here I stick to one possible
explanation of acupuncture that may be feasible and more understandable to
the average American. That explanation is that, if and when acupuncture
works, the pins that are inserted in certain identified points may stimulate
the production of endorphins (pain-fighting brain chemicals). When endor-
phins go up, pain goes down.
Because your pain actually preceded the acupuncture treatment, why weren’t
those endorphins already working beforehand? Didn’t your body know that it
was hurting and shouldn’t it have marshaled your endorphins to get to work?
No one knows why pain sometimes seems to get stuck in the “on” mode. But
acupuncture may give your system that extra little jolt that’s enough to stim-
ulate the endorphins to rush to the hurting area.
Acupuncture is only a temporary fix at best. But then, few remedies that are
associated with fibromyalgia are long-term solutions.
Finding an acupuncturist
You can ask your physician or your friends to recommend an acupuncturist,
but, sometimes, they may disapprove of your plan. Even if they feel neutral or
okay about it, they may not know of an acupuncture practitioner. Another
alternative is to check the Yellow Pages of the phone book under “acupunc-
ture” and look for ads there. Are any of the practitioners medical doctors?
Start with them.
If you’re also considering an acupuncturist who’s not a medical doctor or an
osteopathic physician, make sure that any individual you’re considering is
licensed by the state. Check with the state department of professional regula-
tion, usually based in the state capital. Then be sure that you at least first
talk to that person on the phone before going for an appointment.
Although many non-medical acupuncture practitioners are honest people
who know what they’re doing, some may regard acupuncture as an easy way
to make a few bucks. You should avoid such people! People trying to get rich
quick may also be very careless — in order to save money, they may reuse
the acupuncture needles. Reusing needles is an absolute no-no in acupunc-
ture therapy, because it places you at risk for contracting hepatitis or the HIV
virus that leads to AIDS, as well as far too many other infectious diseases to
mention. The probability that someone would take this risk seems low, but
you need to consider worst-case scenarios and protect yourself as much as
possible.
167
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Remedies and Treatments

I’m not saying that the only good acupuncturist is a person with a medical
degree. I’m just saying that you should put on your best skeptical thinking
cap and your good listening ears, and ask plenty of questions before signing
up for acupuncture treatments with someone who isn’t a doctor. (Actually,
you should also ask plenty of questions even if the acupuncture practitioner
is a medical doctor.)
Some questions to consider asking an acupuncturist — whether the person is
a doctor or not — are
 How long have you been performing acupuncture? More than a year
would be desirable.
 Are you affiliated with a medical doctor or a chiropractor? “Yes” is
better than “no” because it means that someone is at least periodically
checking on the acupuncturist. You should also verify with the doctor or
chiropractor that she does, in fact, have a business relationship with the
acupuncturist. Don’t just take the acupuncturist’s word for it.
 How many sessions will it take for me to feel better, if acupuncture
works for me? If the acupuncturist says daily for weeks, that’s too many.
At most, several times a week at the start of therapy should be sufficient
to start to gain relief. Later, weekly sessions may be sufficient.
 Do you guarantee that this procedure will make me feel better? If 
the person says “yes,” leave. No competent person will issue blanket
guarantees.
To get a listing of medical doctors and osteopathic physicians in your area
who perform acupuncture on patients, contact the American Academy of
Medical Acupuncture at 323-937-5514 or search its Web site at www.medical
acupuncture.org.

No needling me!
Acupressure is a form of therapy that uses
direct pressure in the same areas as acupunc-
ture, but it doesn’t penetrate the skin like the
pins used in acupuncture do. Instead, noninva-
sive (and non-painful), firm pressure is applied.
For areas that you can’t easily reach, such as
your middle or lower back, some people sug-
gest that your acupressurize yourself by lying
on top of a tennis ball and moving around on it.

Homing In on Homeopathy
Homeopathy is based on a 19th-century belief that minute amounts of herbs can
stimulate a healthy reaction in the body. Often, homeopaths rely upon a mixture
of a variety of herbal remedies to treat various chronic medical problems.
In 2001, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a grant to study the
effectiveness of homeopathy to the Society for the Establishment of Research
in Classical Homeopathy (SERCH) in Phoenix, Arizona. They conducted a
two-year study to determine what type of individuals respond best to ho-
meopathy. In this study, published in 2004 in Rheumatology, the researchers
described some of their findings, based on treating 53 FMS patients with indi-
vidually chosen homeopathic remedies versus those given a placebo. The
researchers found that the patients receiving the homeopathic remedies
experienced significantly greater improvements in pain and the number of
tender points, as well as in their quality of life and overall health.
Would homeopathy work for you? Possibly. But in my opinion, it’s best if you
try other treatments first — beginning with mainstream medical treatments
and medications, followed by massage, then acupuncture and/or herbal
remedies and supplements, and then Botox injections. If you’ve tried all these
other treatments (in the order I mention them), and you’re still not getting
relief, then you may want to try homeopathic remedies.
Many people purport to be homeopaths, but do some basic checking. Does
your state require the licensing of homeopaths? If so, check with the licens-
ing bureau or the state health department for a list of licensed individuals in
your area. You may also check the Yellow Pages of your phone book and con-
tact individuals directly. Ask them:
 How long have you been in business? It should be at least three to five
years, to show a track record.
 Are you state-licensed? Check with your state health department to see
if licensing is required, and only ask this question if it is.
 Do you treat fibromyalgia? If the person says, “What’s that?”, move on
to the next candidate.
Beating Fibromyalgia 
with Botox Injections
One of the newer and somewhat controversial remedies that doctors some-
times use to treat people with fibromyalgia is the injection of Botox. Botox is
169
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Remedies and Treatments

a form of the botulinum toxin, which is a kind of a poison that’s created by a
specific bacterium, Clostridium botulinum. At least seven or eight different
forms of Botox are used to treat a wide array of medical problems.
The doses of Botox that are used are considered to be small enough to avoid
harming the patient, but, at the same time, they’re also large enough to pro-
vide noticeable results with a problem of the nervous system or the muscu-
loskeletal system.
Physicians use Botox to treat many different types of medical problems, such
as tremors, tics, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic low-back
or neck pain, chronic headaches, and a wide variety of other medical condi-
tions. Some plastic surgeons also use Botox to cosmetically (and temporar-
ily) rid people of their facial wrinkles.
Physicians who are open to using acupuncture, as well as other alternative
treatments, may also be more open to using Botox therapy. Doctors who are
pain-management experts and neurologists are probably more likely to con-
sider using Botox therapy, although there’s no uniformity on which particular
specialty of doctors use Botox on their patients and which don’t.
Doctors who treat patients with Botox injections should have previous experi-
ence with using this therapy, particularly when using Botox with their patients
who have fibromyalgia and who are very pain sensitive. Don’t let someone
practice on you! In addition, the physician should also be someone whom you
can fully trust with using this relatively new form of therapy on you.
In the hands of an inexperienced and incompetent practitioner who may inject
too high a dose or make other medical errors, Botox treatments can theoreti-
cally cause a temporary paralysis or even result in more severe harm to some
patients. This risk is yet another reason to make sure that you receive your
Botox treatments only from a doctor knowledgeable and experienced in the
procedure.
Botox and fibromyalgia
Botox treatments for people with fibromyalgia are a relatively new form of
therapy. But Botox use may explode in the next few years, particularly if both
clinical research and patients’ word of mouth indicate that Botox can provide
the pain relief that patients so desperately want and need. In fact, it could
really take off if the prices come down.
Joseph Kandel, MD, a neurologist and the medical director of Neuroscience &
Spine Associates in Naples, Florida, has treated numerous fibromyalgia
170
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

patients with Botox treatments. Dr. Kandel says that Botox injections can be
quite successful in treating the muscle changes, muscle spasms, and the gen-
eral spasticity that many patients with fibromyalgia experience.
Dr. Kandel says that the relief that’s provided by a Botox injection may take 7
to 21 days to start working; however, many patients get some pain relief
within a few days because of the acupuncture effect of the needle. When it
starts working, the pain relief from Botox injections may last anywhere from a
few weeks to a few months, depending on the individual patient. During that
temporary period, patients may experience at least a partial reprieve from
their severe pain, allowing them to exercise and increase range of motion and
muscle function. These actions can then help patients to prevent, or at least
delay, a further flare-up in problem areas.
Using Botox in pain management is a relatively new application. The use of
Botox in fibromyalgia has not been sufficiently studied in clinical tests to
determine whether it’s a useful therapy. Doctors who do favor Botox say that
it works for most, but not all, of their patients. So don’t expect any guaran-
tees if you sign up for Botox injections. (For that matter, don’t expect guaran-
tees with any other medical procedures that you receive, either.)
As of this writing, the FDA hasn’t approved Botox injections to treat chronic
pain from fibromyalgia or any other chronic-pain condition. This approval
may come in the near future, but it’s not here yet. Despite this fact, doctors
may still legally administer the injections.
171
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Remedies and Treatments
A healthful bacteria
Most people spend a lot of time trying to avoid
bacteria, carefully washing their hands with
antibacterial soap, taking daily baths or show-
ers, and trying to keep their bodies and their
clothes as clean as they can. For the most part,
bacteria are seen as being bad and something
to avoid. Botox is created by bacteria, so the
idea of injecting it into your system may make
you feel a little squeamish. It may almost sound
like injecting dirt into your body.
Yet, when you really think about it, not all bac-
teria are bad. Here’s one simple example:
Bacteria in your stomach enable you to digest
your food more easily by helping to break it
down. When you take antibiotics to combat an
infection that you have (such as a strep throat
or a urinary tract infection), those bacteria may
be killed, or at least weakened, and thus, you
get diarrhea and can’t digest your food as well.
You may also develop a yeast infection while
you’re taking antibiotics because the bacteria
that were killed by the antibiotic were also the
ones that had previously kept the yeast at bay.
They’re gone, so the yeast can proliferate. So,
it’s not exactly true that the only good bacteria
are dead bacteria.

How much Botox costs and 
whether insurance pays
If you’re currently considering Botox therapy, keep in mind that this form of
therapy is generally not a low-cost option, and if you have a shortage of dol-
lars, you may not even be able to afford it. In general, Botox is more like the
upscale, probably-not-covered-by-your-health-insurance form of treatment.
Always check first by simply calling and asking your insurance company if
Botox treatments are covered. If and when the FDA approves Botox as a ther-
apy for chronic pain, more health-insurance providers will likely cover such
treatments.
Most patients need to receive at least two vials of Botox to gain a sufficient
amount of the substance to obtain relief from their chronic pain, and one vial
costs about $600. As a result, in considering all the costs involved, a Botox
procedure can cost at least $1,200 — and the price can go much higher than
that.
However, proponents say that when Botox injections work to resolve symp-
toms, patients won’t need lots of doctor visits, and they can also avoid taking
many doses of pain medications and, thus, avoid enduring their side effects.
Looking at it from that point of view, Botox injections may be cost-effective
treatments for some fibromyalgia patients.
Taking On Tai Chi
The gentle art of the basic Chinese exercise movements of tai chi are usually
not overly difficult to master, and generally these movements can also be a
very good form of exercise for people who have fibromyalgia or other
chronic-pain problems. According to the CDC, about 5 million adults in the
United States have tried tai chi and 2.6 million have used it in the past year.
The basic exercises of tai chi are meant to resemble natural animal move-
ments, such as movements that may be made by a crane, a tiger, a snake, or
other animals. For example, one simple tai chi movement involves standing
on one leg as a crane would.
Tai chi helps patients with FMS in two basic ways: The exercises are rela-
tively easy to perform for people with muscle problems who find it difficult to
perform more arduous exercises. Also, the exercises can help with relaxation,
in a meditative sort of way.
172
Part III: Looking At All Your Treatment Options 

Tai chi movements are also considered low-impact exercises, so they gener-
ally involve very little risk for the person who’s practicing them. In fact, tai
chi exercises are even recommended for elderly and sick people who are
living in nursing homes — so how hard can they be for the rest of us? You
may also find that regular practicing of the basic tai chi exercises may consid-
erably ease your pain and fatigue.
173
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Remedies and Treatments
Nerving yourself for neurotherapies in the future
A number of new treatment techniques are
emerging that change the way the brain
responds to pain without medications. They are
called neurotherapies, and research is showing
them as promising. The idea behind neurother-
apies is that abnormal brain activity is one of the
fundamental issues behind pain and sleep prob-
lems in FMS. Theoretically, if that abnormal
function can be corrected, symptom improve-
ment should follow.
For example, neurofeedback is a treatment
option that enables users to consciously modify
their electroencephalographic (EEG) brain-
wave patterns. Research has shown that
patients with fibromyalgia have abnormal brain-
wave patterns, and the more severe their pain,
the more abnormal the EEG pattern problem.
The idea is that, when abnormal patterns are
identified, subjects can use neurofeedback to
modify them in a positive way, leading to
improvements in their fibromyalgia symptoms.
Neurofeedback, a technique pioneered by
NASA, is different from biofeedback (described
in Chapter 13). With biofeedback, users con-
centrate on lowering their blood pressure,
pulse, and body temperature to achieve a
relaxed state. In contrast, with neurofeedback,
users try to change their actual brain waves,
with expert assistance.
Physicians and other experts who support neu-
rofeedback as a treatment for fibromyalgia and
other chronic pain problems say it can be highly
effective. The International Society for
Neurofeedback 
& 
Research
(www.isnr.org) is an organization promot-
ing education and research for neurofeedback.
A section of its Web site is dedicated to infor-
mation for patients and families.
Neuromodulation is another high-tech treat-
ment option for FMS patients, and one that does
not rely upon feedback, as do neurofeedback
and biofeedback. Instead, tiny electrical signals
non-invasively target and correct abnormal
brain activity. During neuromodulation therapy
in a doctor’s office, the patient rests in a com-
fortable chair. A few sensors are placed on the
scalp near areas of the brain that are function-
ing abnormally. The sensors rest on the scalp
and nothing pierces the skin, so there is no pain
or discomfort. When the sensors are in place,
patients close their eyes and relax. A trained
clinician uses special neuromodulation equip-
ment to monitor the patient’s EEG and deliver
the targeted neuromodulation signal. The
process lasts about 15 minutes. Usually a few
weeks of therapy with visits twice a week are
needed.

How do you master tai chi? You can often take classes on tai chi movements
at a community center or at your fitness club; check your local newspapers
for mentions of classes. You may also want to supplement your knowledge
with T’ai Chi For Dummies, by Therese Iknoian (Wiley), a helpful book that
can show you all the ropes.
Repelling Magnet Therapy
Some people believe that using magnetized necklaces, bracelets, earrings, or
even magnetic bed mattresses — as well as magnets in many other forms —
can somehow decrease their pain. Sadly, a review of the existing evidence on
magnet therapy indicates there is little evidence that static magnets provide
significant pain relief for people with fibromyalgia or other diseases with
chronic pain. It would be nice if they did, but the truth is, they simply don’t
work. However, read about transcranial magnetic therapy (TMS) in Chapter
11. This emerging therapy may actually help patients with FMS.
Be a skeptical reader when you come across ads or even articles about non-
traditional therapies, particularly when you read about claims for “magnet
therapy.” Despite the dramatic ad copy, complete with testimonials, and
despite rhetoric that sounds really scientific (although it’s usually written in
such a way that few people could make sense out of it), keep in mind that
magnet therapy is a no-sale when it comes to pain relief for fibromyalgia.
If you use magnets to help your pain, fatigue, and other symptoms of fibromyal-
gia and find that you are feeling better, you’re most likely experiencing the
placebo effect. In other words, you intensely hoped and believed that the ther-
apy would work for you, and so, for a short time, your fervent desire for symp-
tomatic relief seemed to make magnet therapy improve your condition.
After a while, however, your mind and your pain will both overcome your
wishful thinking, and you’ll be right back to where you started: hurting again
(minus the money you spent for all the magnetized paraphernalia).
Will magnet therapy hurt you in any way at all? Probably not. No evidence
suggests that using magnets will be harmful to you — unless you decide to
substitute magnet therapy for your medication or for other treatments that
can provide you with real pain improvement.

M
any people want to get rid of their pain and the
other symptoms related to fibromyalgia even more
than they can by simply taking medications. They want to
be proactive. I agree! I recommend plenty of good lifestyle
changes for patients with fibromyalgia, and I include them
all in Part IV. For example, most people with fibromyalgia
are hyperstressed, much more so than the average person
without fibromyalgia. Reduce the stress, and you ease
your symptoms, which is why I devote Chapter 13 to
“depressurizing” yourself.
Increasing your amount of quality sleep time is another
good lifestyle change. Many people with fibromyalgia are
insomniacs or have other sleep problems, which worsens
their symptoms. I address these issues in Chapter 14. I
also cover the importance of exercising (yes, I do have to
discuss this, and yes it helps), paying attention to weight
issues, and avoiding foods that can trigger symptoms. You
get all this in one chapter: Chapter 15. Then I discuss your
emotions, which are often run pretty ragged from the
pain, fatigue, and other symptoms. So I tell you what to do
about those emotional troughs in Chapter 16.

id you ever think that you’d need help with relaxing? Can you simply
just let go and relax yourself at will — take a vacation, go see a movie,
do something else that you enjoy so that you make the stress evaporate like
the dew before the morning sun? It’d be wonderful if unwinding from life’s
stresses were that easy. But often, it’s not.
Most people really don’t know how to relax. They may think that they know
how, but often, the means that they choose to relax themselves can be use-
less or even harmful.
If you think that I’m exaggerating, let me give you a few common examples of
some of the major means that people use to “relax”: drinking alcohol, gorging
on chocolate cake (or chocolate anything), going to visit the in-laws. (Just
kidding about that last one, which is actually a stress creator for many
people!)
In this chapter, I explain several effective ways that you can relax by using
various stress-busting techniques. When you use these techniques to de-
stress, you also help to diminish your fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) symp-
toms — because stress and fibromyalgia are related.

Knowing When You’re Too Stressed
Maybe you don’t think that you’re really all that stressed out, or at least no
more than most of the other people you know at work or at home. But, some-
times, when people feel the same bad way for a long time, they don’t even
realize that they could feel better — sometimes, much better. This skewed
perspective is certainly true for overly stressed people. You may have forgot-
ten what feeling plain-old normal is like. How do you know?
Reading through the following list can help you determine just how stressed
you are. This list isn’t really a test, where you answer true or false, and then I
tell you exactly what to do based on your answers. But it should get you
thinking about how much stress you really have in your life.
 I frequently berate the driving of other people when I drive. They all
drive like total morons. If you spend most of your driving time ridicul-
ing the driving of others, and screaming and yelling at these people who
can’t hear you, you’re probably stressed out. Sure, some of the drivers
are probably annoying or even incompetent. But most of them are, at
least, average. Maybe the real problem is your own underlying stress,
which you’re taking out on others who can’t argue back.
 Nearly every morning when I wake up, I’m worried about whether I’ll
be able to get everything done. If your first thought upon waking up in
the morning is to worry about getting all your many tasks done, you’re
not hitting the day running. You’re hitting the day crashing and burning.
Everyone worries sometimes. But you need to take a moment to chill
out, including in the a.m.
The stress-pain connection in fibromyalgia
Studies indicate that people with fibromyalgia
are much more prone to suffering from stress
thanother people are, and that this increased vul-
nerability to stress worsens their fibromyalgia-
related pain. One study, reported in a 2001 issue
of the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, asked 101
women, including women with fibromyalgia and
women with severe knee pain from osteoarthri-
tis, about their stress. The researchers found
that the women with FMS reported much
greater levels of stress than the women with
severe osteoarthritis.
In a related study, researchers purposely
caused the women with fibromyalgia and those
with osteoarthritis to experience stress by
having them discuss stressful events. The
researchers found that the women with FMS
experienced increased pain with stress, but the
women who had osteoarthritis were not simi-
larly affected. Stress doesn’t cause pain, but for
women with fibromyalgia, it clearly can make it
much worse.

 I feel like everyone is demanding too much of me, and I’m being torn
apart. You may feel like your partner wants things from you, your family
members are demanding other things, and your boss wants something
else. You feel like the rope in a game of emotional tug-of-war. That’s
stress.
 If my boss asks me to do just one more thing, I think I’ll explode. You
may think that you have too much to do as it is, but while you’re trying
to do what you’re supposed to do, your boss keeps loading you down
with even more work. It’s maddening! If you feel terribly overloaded and
your boss is unsympathetic, take a deep breath and work on relaxation.
Therapy may also help you deal with your anger, even when it’s well-
placed anger.
 My family members don’t care about my problems and they never
offer to help. If you don’t think that your family is caring and support-
ive, you may have a problem with stress. This is true whether you’re
right about your uncaring family or wrong, and they really do care.
(Perception can cloud out reality.)
A caring family can go a long way to reduce stress. However, for some
people, a caring and helpful family can be a stress inducer — if you’re
worried that your child is doing too much for you or if you’re an over-
achiever and you can’t stand it that others are doing things for you that
you think you should be doing yourself.
 As soon as I get home, I make a beeline for the liquor cabinet or a six-
pack in the fridge. If you feel so overwhelmed by work and/or family
problems that you head for some alcoholic refreshment at the slightest
provocation, you need to be concerned about your stress levels. Many
people think that alcohol is the answer for stress relief, but if you’re
emotionally or physically dependent on it, it isn’t. Work on de-stressing
your life, using various healthy techniques, instead. And get some help
for the alcohol dependency.
 On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being best, my life is a –5. This one is a
little silly, asking if your life could be rated in the negative numbers on a
scale of 1 to 10. However, if you nodded your head when you read this,
you’re experiencing entirely too much stress in your life.
 I can’t remember when I’ve been to a nonbusiness dinner or done
anything that’s fun. Doing things just for fun is a normal part of life. If
you can’t remember the last night you had a nonbusiness dinner, went
to the movie, or just plain did something fun, then face it: You’re sad-
dling yourself with too much stress. Don’t have any time for fun? You
need to make and take the time. Doing so pays off in reduced symptoms
of stress and fibromyalgia.
 I’ve been averaging about five hours of sleep a night. Sleep problems
are a major factor for many people with fibromyalgia. If you get less than
eight hours of sleep a night, you need to work on that problem. A good
night’s sleep can help you de-stress and reduce your symptoms. (Read
Chapter 14 for more information on sleep and fibromyalgia.)
179
Chapter 13: Depressurizing Yourself: Controlling the Stress-Eyed Monster

 Sometimes, I worry that the boss will fire me. Sometimes, I worry that
he won’t, and I’ll have to do this job for the rest of my life. If you con-
stantly worry about getting fired, you’re under some stress. You may also
be suffering from problems with anxiety and depression as well. If you
really hate your job this much, isn’t it time to just look for another one?
Feeling trapped in a job can increase your stress levels tremendously.
Chilling Out with Relaxation Therapy
Relaxation therapy is a strategy that uses steps to achieve an overall calming
of both the body and the mind. In general, the person consciously concen-
trates on relaxing one part of the body, or one set of muscles, at a time until
the entire body is in a state of relaxation. The great thing about relaxation
therapy is that you can practice it on your own at home as often as you want.
Here’s how it works: Close the blinds or pull down the shades (if darkness
helps you relax, as it does for many people). Then lie down and begin the
therapy.
You can really start by relaxing any part of your body, as long as you concen-
trate, focus, and work to completely relax that part of your body. For example,
you may choose to start at your feet.
In this case, you start by imagining your feet becoming increasingly relaxed,
loose, and tension-free. You breathe deeply and tell yourself, in your mind,
that your feet are becoming heavy and too hard to hold up. Then you imagine
this relaxed feeling slowly moving its way up your body to the knees and then
to the upper legs. Keep telling yourself that each part of the body is heavy
and needs (and wants) to rest.
Take your time. You can’t rush through relaxation therapy. Don’t move on to
another part of your body until the part that you’re concentrating on feels
completely relaxed.
The relaxation mode continues up through the trunk of your body and out
into your arms. You may choose to end with your head and your very, very
tired eyes that just want to close. Or you may want to close your eyes at the
very beginning of your relaxation session. Either way can work.
You may notice that relaxation therapy uses some of the basic techniques
that are also used in hypnotherapy; however, with relaxation therapy, relax-
ation is the goal. With hypnotherapy, relaxation is merely the path to get to
the goal, which is to adopt suggestions that are given to you while you’re
under hypnosis.

Some people accompany their relaxation “self-talk” with thinking about a
pleasant place where they feel relaxed. Some people imagine resting in a
quiet forest; others may equate relaxation with thinking about the crashing 
of the ocean’s waves or another scene. You’re bounded only by your own 
imagination.
If you think that relaxation therapy sounds like nonsense, try making a deal
with yourself. You want to find a way to feel more relaxed, with less fatigue,
stiffness, and pain, right? So why not give relaxation therapy at least one or two
tries? What have you got to lose? If it doesn’t work, you haven’t done yourself
any harm or even wasted any money. And if it does work, you’ve gained a new
strategy to cope with your stress and, perhaps, lessen your FMS pain.
You can purchase a relaxation audiotape to help you discover everything
you’d ever need to know about relaxation therapy. Some stores even let you
listen to relaxation audiotapes before you decide to buy one. Listen for a
voice you find appealing and soothing. Avoid tapes that offer subliminal mes-
sages (messages heard only unconsciously); they may work, but the goal is to
figure out how to achieve relaxation on your own, when you don’t have the
tape available.
Stress-Busting with Biofeedback Therapy
When most people become upset or angry, their bodies react with raised
blood pressure and pulse and with changes in skin temperature as well. They
may remain angry or upset for a long time, which worsens their fibromyalgia
symptoms of pain, fatigue, sleep difficulties, and so on.
You can work on what’s bothering you with talk therapy, by discussing it with
a therapist. Another option is to master the art of controlling and changing
your own body responses. It’s hard to stay upset when your blood pressure
and pulse drop, your breathing steadies, and your body temperature 
stabilizes.
Can you really control your body changes, such as lowering your blood pres-
sure, dropping your skin temperature, and making other physical changes?
Supporters of biofeedback (a therapy that works to enable the user to change
his body responses through concentration and observation of physical
changes on a computer screen) think that yes, you can. And they also believe
that biofeedback training can enable you to become more focused and more
relaxed.
181
Chapter 13: Depressurizing Yourself: Controlling the Stress-Eyed Monster

Understanding what happens
Different biofeedback practitioners use different methods, but in general, the
patient sits in a chair and is connected to a series of monitors. One monitor
takes the skin temperature of the hand or arm. Another monitor, often placed
on a finger, takes the pulse. Other monitors may also be used to take various
body measurements, such as your blood pressure.
The individual views a representation (often a line graph) of temperature or
pulse on a monitor, and is told to relax. As the person relaxes, she can see the
measures dropping down. As she relaxes further, the line also drops as well. If
the person gets agitated, the line starts to climb up.
When it works, biofeedback enables a person to learn to decrease these vari-
ous measures of stress. By doing so, that person can achieve a better state of
relaxation, which she can duplicate when she’s not hooked up to monitors
and machines.

If relaxation therapy can help with heartburn, it
can help with fibromyalgia
In 1994, researchers reported on the results of
training people who suffer from severe chronic
heartburn 
in 
relaxation 
therapy 
in
Gastroenterology, a journal for physicians spe-
cializing in digestive diseases. Chronic heart-
burn? What’s that got to do with fibromyalgia?
Just bear with me for a moment.
The researchers had inserted special instru-
ments in the stomachs of the subjects, so that
they could actually measure each person’s
stomach acidity when the experiment began,
and then again when it ended. Then they trained
subjects in one group to perform relaxation
therapy, while the other group watched a movie.
Both groups were given the same heartburn-
inducing meals. (Pepperoni pizza with extra
cheese and cola to drink.)
So what happened? The relaxation-therapy
group experienced a significant reduction in the
level of acidity in their stomachs, and they also
felt much better. The other group, which didn’t
receive the relaxation training, suffered from
significantly higher levels of stomach acidity,
and they also experienced heartburn.
The researchers hypothesized that maybe the
deep breathing that was part of the relaxation
therapy helped people with heartburn feel
better. Or maybe the relaxation itself somehow
reduced the production of acid.
The point, and the relationship to fibromyalgia,
is this: Relaxation therapy had a pronounced
effect in this study, such that people somehow
unknowingly reduced their stomach acid by
practicing relaxation therapy. So, isn’t it also
possible that relaxation therapy may help
reduce some of your troubling symptoms of
fibromyalgia, such as pain, morning stiffness,
and sleep problems? Certainly, relaxation ther-
apy seems to be well worth a try.

That’s the theory, anyway. It doesn’t always work, particularly with Type A
achievers who are more likely to see the graph take a downturn and automat-
ically become excited, causing stress levels to rise. For some people, equat-
ing relaxation with success is very difficult.
Some studies of the results of biofeedback have indicated that patients with
fibromyalgia have decreased their pain, fatigue, and morning stiffness and
also improved their sleep.
Perhaps one reason why biofeedback may work for people with fibromyalgia
is that studies of people with FMS have indicated that they have temperature
differences as well as differences in the blood flow, compared to people who
don’t have fibromyalgia. If the problem is body responses, and you can dis-
cover how to change your physical responses, you may also be able to
master your fibromyalgia symptoms. This ability to control your physical
responses doesn’t mean that you can cure yourself of all pain and fatigue for-
ever. But if biofeedback works for you, it may give you an edge, and a way to
improve how you feel.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of biofeedback therapy
As you may expect, biofeedback therapy has both benefits and liabilities. Let
me start with the “bad” news:
 Your health-insurance company may not provide coverage, so the ses-
sions can be pricey.
 Identifying a trained professional who has the equipment and who is
competent to provide the therapy may be difficult.
 The therapy takes time. Biofeedback improvements may not occur in
the first few sessions, and it may take longer than you’d like before you
see any results — not a good thing if you’re paying out of pocket for
these treatments.
The major pro is that if biofeedback therapy works, you’ll feel better. Experts
also believe that you can generalize the results of biofeedback to your daily
life. That is, after you’ve mastered the technique, you no longer need to be
hooked up to a machine that measures your blood pressure, pulse, and so
forth. Instead, when you feel yourself starting to stress out, you can (at least,
theoretically) call upon the capabilities that you’ve gained through the
biofeedback training. In one study, patients were still successful at using what
they’d learned even six months after biofeedback therapy had completely
ended. They hadn’t forgotten the techniques, even though they were no
longer receiving the treatments.
183
Chapter 13: Depressurizing Yourself: Controlling the Stress-Eyed Monster

Finding biofeedback providers
In general, psychologists and therapists are the primary people who provide
biofeedback therapy to the stressed-out individuals who need it. They have
the equipment, and they have the training to know how to use it correctly and
to help you mobilize your abilities. You can ask your physician and others you
know if they can recommend anyone with training in biofeedback therapy. If
you live near a university or major hospital, you can call the public-relations
staff to find out if they know of any biofeedback practitioners.
Mesmerizing the Pain: Hypnotherapy
Look deeply into my eyes! You’re getting sleepy, very sleepy. Most people think
of hypnotherapy in terms of a rather scary-looking person who somehow
makes them fall into his “power” and then induces them to lose weight or rid
themselves of other bad habits. Or they may perceive hypnosis as something
fake and useless — a carnival trick — and nothing more.
Although, sadly, plenty of charlatans are out there in the business, claiming
to offer hypnosis services but selling only lies, many other people in the busi-
ness actually do provide a genuine service. Hypnosis (done correctly) really
can help some people gain better control over their lives, helping them to
become more calm (and not zombified!), lose weight, stop smoking, or alter
their other bad habits.
184
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 
A reminder: Rest!
Taking time out for some rest and relaxation is
not a bad thing, although you may think that it is
in our hyperactive society where the cultural
concentration is centered on working harder
and faster. Your body and your mind need diver-
sions. At least once every few days, do some-
thing fun or take some time to do nothing at all.
Doing nothing involves activities like listening to
gentle music, or watching birds outside your
window, or taking a bubble bath. Include this
kind of downtime in your schedule because it’s
good for your body and for your soul.
Don’t watch television to relax, and if you do
watch TV, stop watching it at least 30 minutes
before you want to go to bed. Watching TV (or
searching the Internet on your computer)
causes the electrical activity of the brain to
increase, and makes relaxation and sleep more
difficult to achieve.

Hypnosis has other possible applications as well, and one practical possibil-
ity (if it works) is to assist you with getting to sleep or gaining some control
over your pain. Hypnosis has been used successfully to calm people who
need painful medical or dental procedures, and even to help cancer patients
who need to control their pain. Hypnosis can be very helpful with pain man-
agement for many conditions, including fibromyalgia.
In fact, hypnotherapy has been shown to work for some patients with
fibromyalgia. For example, in a study of patients with fibromyalgia treated
with hypnotherapy or physical therapy (reported in a 1991 issue of the
Journal of Rheumatology), researchers found that the patients who received
12 weeks of hypnotherapy reported better sleep, less fatigue, and less pain
than the subjects who’d received physical therapy. The benefits were sus-
tained for six months after the end of the hypnotherapy.
Considering what hypnosis is and isn’t
Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness. It isn’t a state of sleep, but it
isn’t exactly a state of being awake, either. Contrary to any myths that you
may have heard about hypnosis, it’s not some magic trick that’s performed
on you to make you do stupid things (like barking like a dog) that you aren’t
aware of. In addition, a hypnotist can’t compel you to do anything that you’d
consider objectionable or dangerous. A hypnotist may, however, be able to
help you marshal your inner resources to figure out how to relax, as well as
lose weight, quit smoking, and conquer other bad habits.
Knowing exactly what goes 
on during hypnotherapy
Hypnosis creates a passive, relaxed state. During that state, the person being
hypnotized is receptive to suggestions that can benefit her needs or goals.
During a hypnotherapy session, the hypnotist has the patient sit back or lie
down. Often, the individual closes her eyes. The hypnotist uses some relaxation-
therapy techniques, such as telling the person that her feet are very tired, then
her knees, and so on. The hypnotist may tell the person that on the count of ten,
she will be extremely relaxed.
The hypnotist may then tell the person that she can’t open her eyes, and
then tell the person to try to open her eyes, even though she can’t. If the
person struggles to open her eyes, but fails, she’s in a hypnotic trance. If her
eyes fly open, she isn’t, and more effort needs to be done to achieve a light
trance.
185
Chapter 13: Depressurizing Yourself: Controlling the Stress-Eyed Monster

In most cases, the hypnotist tailors the session to the problem to be
addressed. For example, if stress reduction is the goal, the hypnotist may tell
the person to imagine a place where she felt really calm, happy, and serene.
The hypnotist may tell her to think about how she felt, what the scene
appeared like, what sounds she heard, and so forth. The person may be told
that she’s in this place, and she’s very happy. She may be told that when
she’s feeling very stressed out, she should think about this place, and she’ll
begin to feel calmer and more relaxed.
Locating a hypnotherapist
You may want to ask your physician if she can recommend a hypnotist —
keeping in mind that many doctors consider hypnosis a dubious procedure,
at best. You can also locate therapists who’ve been trained and certified in
hypnotherapy through your state or local psychological and psychiatric
associations. (If your doctor has a negative opinion of hypnosis, you don’t
have to let that prevent you from finding a qualified hypnotherapist.)
Mastering self-hypnosis
Maybe you’d prefer to take charge and figure out how to perform hypnosis on
yourself. But how on earth can you first put yourself under, and then, at the
same time, give yourself hypnotic suggestions? It may sound impossible, but
experts say that self-hypnosis is doable.
One possibility is to use a tape recording of your voice with the suggestions
that you want to reinforce in your mind. Another possibility is to sort of “pre-
program” your mind with the ideas and concepts that you want to concen-
trate upon, such as imagining your body as healthy, strong, and with little or
no pain. Use your relaxation therapy techniques to achieve a state of relax-
ation, and then introduce the positive goals that you want to achieve.

with Self-Hypnosis, by Frank Caprio, MD, and Joseph Berger. You can also read

Meditating, Doing Yoga, and Praying
Shutting out the world outside and just concentrating on your own inner self,
thinking about a higher power, or thinking about nothing at all can help you
to calm your body down and ease your mind away from the things that
bother you so much. It may help you cut back on your painful symptoms of
fibromyalgia as well.
Meditation
One of the many forms of meditation may work for you. One study indicated
that women with fibromyalgia who practiced daily meditation — about an
hour a day for six days a week, over an eight-week period — reported lower
levels of pain, better sleep, and lower levels of depression than when they’d
begun the study.
Psychologists and other experts can teach methods of meditation, and many
communities have free or low-cost classes to provide training on how to med-
itate. Experts say that meditation is not, however, a quick-fix answer, and the
techniques must be learned and practiced for at least a few months before
significant results can be noticed.
If you’re interested in finding out more about meditation, check out
Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stephen Bodian (Wiley). It comes
with a CD of guided meditation exercises that you can follow along with if the
idea of sitting silently for more than a couple minutes makes you stir-crazy.
Yoga
Twisting your body around like a pretzel? Sounds more like a stress-inducing
plan instead of something that can cause a state of calmness. So how on
earth can yoga help you? Well, first of all, erase from your mind the idea that
you must contort your body into impossible (and painful) positions, because
that’s a stereotypical view of yoga. True, yoga does have some very tough
positions, but those are for advanced students, not beginners. As with most
new forms of exercise, you start slowly and build your way up. When you
have fibromyalgia, this building-block policy is particularly important to
avoid more strain and pain.

If you want to discover much more information on the basics of yoga — and
just about everything else you need to know about this subject — be sure to
read Yoga For Dummies, by Georg Feuerstein, PhD, and Larry Payne, PhD
(Wiley).
Prayer
Some people with FMS report that praying helps them feel much better.
Prayer may act much in the same way as meditation and yoga do, instilling
calmness and an acceptance that you’re really not in control, that you can’t
be expected to be accountable for everything, and that you don’t need to
frantically rush about trying to solve difficult problems right away. Instead,
you give yourself a break and — at least temporarily — leave the resolutions
of your pain and your problems to the cosmos.
Many churches have prayer circles, in which you can ask other people to pray
for you. You can even find prayer circles on the Internet. In some studies,
doctors have found that being prayed for can improve an individual’s ability
to survive a heart attack or dangerous surgeries. So, why shouldn’t they work
for fibromyalgia?

Sleep Disorders
In This Chapter
 Understanding sleep and its importance for people with fibromyalgia
 Knowing about sleep stages and their relevance to fibromyalgia syndrome
 Discovering common sleep disorders for those with fibromyalgia
 Considering lifestyle changes that enhance sleep
 Treating sleep disorders with medications and alternative remedies
Juanita’s fibromyalgia pain occurs every day, and it’s very severe — so bad
that she can’t work most days and is considering filing for disability bene-
fits. Bob’s pain is intermittent; some days are overwhelming, and other days
he can pretty much ignore the pain and the fatigue. Darlene feels achy and
exhausted nearly every day, but she somehow manages to take care of the
kids and work part-time.
All three have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), although
the severity of their disease and how they cope with it are very different for
each person. They all share one common denominator, though: Juanita, Bob,
and Darlene have serious sleep problems, each averaging only about four to
six hours of sleep nearly every night.
The majority of people with fibromyalgia (at least 55 percent) have sleep diffi-
culties, whether they have trouble getting to sleep in the first place or fre-
quently wake up after falling asleep. (Some people have both problems.)
Of course, solving sleep disorders doesn’t automatically cure your fibromyal-
gia. But in many cases, a good night’s sleep can considerably ease the pain
and the fatigue of your illness. Because pain and fatigue are usually the most
troubling symptoms for people with fibromyalgia, resolving sleep problems is
clearly very important.

190
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 
In this chapter, I cover why a good night’s sleep is so important for people with
fibromyalgia, including spending sufficient quality time in each sleep stage. I
also cover the key types of sleep problems that people with FMS experience
and offer practical advice on how to achieve the sleep time you need through
lifestyle changes, medications, and other immediately doable options.
What Is Sleep?
Sleep is a biological process of altered consciousness that all humans must
undergo on a regular basis in order to replenish their bodies in physical, bio-
chemical, and psychological ways.
I don’t want you to feel like you’re in Biology 101, but you do need to have a
basic grasp of what exactly sleep is and how it affects your body. Sure, you
probably think that you know what sleep is. It’s that process that occurs
sometime between going to bed and waking up again. (Or, if you have
fibromyalgia, it’s that annoying process of trying to rest and waking up with
pain and frustration several times each night.) But did you know that sleep
has important levels that people need to experience? And did you also know
that sleep has necessary biochemical and psychological purposes? Sleep
enables the body to repair damaged tissue and also provides the opportunity
for dreaming, which scientists have proven is a necessary process for physi-
cal and mental health.
Contrary to popular belief, your body doesn’t automatically shut down to the
point of being just short of switching to the “Off” position when you go to
sleep. Some processes slow down, but others speed up. Some important hor-
mones, such as cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin, are secreted when
you sleep or shortly before you wake up. If you don’t sleep enough, the pro-
duction of these hormones can be thrown off, which may increase the proba-
bility of pain for fibromyalgia sufferers. Your brain continues to be extremely
active in sleep, orchestrating all these processes for you.
Your body also operates with an underlying circadian rhythm, like an internal
clock for when you’re asleep and when you’re wide awake. Unfortunately, bad
sleep patterns can become engrained sometimes. Don’t worry: You can break
them, and in this chapter I discuss ways to achieve good sleep habits.
Understanding the Importance 
of Sleep Stages
People need to experience enough sleep, in terms of the number of hours
that they sleep (usually seven to eight hours per night), and they also need to

experience all the different stages of sleep, ranging from light sleep to deep
sleep. Some researchers believe that people with fibromyalgia don’t spend
enough time in the very deep sleep levels. A lack of quality deep sleep may
inhibit an adequate production of important protective hormones that are
normally made while we sleep, such as growth hormones and prolactin.
Prolactin is the same hormone that’s released by nursing mothers (although
sleep releases much less of it), but scientists aren’t sure exactly what func-
tion prolactin fulfills in nonlactating people.
In 2001, researchers reported on their study of the nighttime hormone levels
of women with and without fibromyalgia in the Journal of Clinical
Endocrinology & Metabolism. They found that women with fibromyalgia (who
agreed to take no medication during the study) had significantly lower levels
of both nocturnal growth hormone and prolactin. This result provides even
more proof that fibromyalgia is real! It also serves as another indicator that
people with fibromyalgia should pay special attention to resolving their sleep
problems.
Note: Men also release prolactin during deep sleep stages, but less than
women.
When people with fibromyalgia sleep even less than they usually do, they
hurt more. Sleep expert William C. Dement, MD, PhD, and Christopher
Vaughan say in their book, The Promise of Sleep, that in experiments in which
people with fibromyalgia are purposely deprived of sleep, their pain is signifi-
cantly greater.
Here are the three basic types of sleep, according to sleep experts:
 Light sleep (Stages 1 and 2)
 Deep sleep (Stages 3 and 4)
 Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
Light sleep
Stage 1 is the lightest stage of sleep, and it’s also the doorway to eventual
dreamland. If you’re awakened from Stage 1 sleep, you may deny that you
were sleeping at all and may say that you were simply “resting your eyes.” In
this stage, virtually any little thing — a minor sound or a light touch — can
easily awaken you. In Stage 2, another stage of light sleep, you can still be
awakened easily, but you’ll know that you were asleep if you’re awakened.
Light sleep is important because of its relaxation qualities and also because
it’s part of the stepwise process that leads to deep sleep and to the rapid eye
movement (REM) stage of sleep. You can’t get to the deeper stages of sleep
unless you go through the first two stages of light sleep.
191
Chapter 14: Sweet Dreams! Combating Sleep Disorders

Deep sleep
When you’re in the deep and deeper levels of Stage 3 and Stage 4 sleep, your
body is completely relaxed and people have difficulty waking you up. Stage 4
is also known as slow-wave sleep because of the characteristic brain wave
patterns of this stage.
During deep sleep, your heart slows down and your breathing becomes regu-
lar and relaxed. Your body also releases a small amount of growth hormone,
which helps rebuild damaged tissue. Other hormones are also released, such
as prolactin and melatonin.
If you don’t have enough sleep and, consequently, don’t spend enough time
in deep sleep, the biochemical processes that are supposed to occur are
aborted or may not happen at all. This is probably a key reason why the pain
is worse for an FMS sufferer who’s slept very little.
If you have trouble sleeping, one tactic that may help is simulating the
breathing of a very deep sleep. Doing so may induce your tired body to slip
into a sleep state. Try this: Lie down in a comfortable and quiet place. Take in
a deep breath and let it out very slowly. Repeat several times. Concentrate
only on your breathing and on nothing else. Don’t worry about falling asleep,
about your fibromyalgia, or work or family problems. Just breathe. Breathing
is all that matters.
REM sleep
The REM stage of sleep is the time when dreams occur. This stage is called rapid
eye movement because scientists have studied the brain waves of people who
are dreaming and have noted that sleepers actually move their eyes back and
forth under their eyelids at that time, almost as if they were watching a movie.
The body may release cortisol in this stage (although cortisol can be released
anytime during sleep). Cortisol is a hormone released by the adrenal glands.
It controls blood pressure, blood sugar, and other key body functions. Some
people with FMS may have overly low levels of cortisol in the daytime, lead-
ing to excessive fatigue, and overly high levels at night (causing insomnia).
Cortisol production peaks early in the morning, shortly before you awake.
Identifying Key Sleep Problems
Everyone has trouble sleeping once in awhile, but suffering from a chronic
sleep deficit is a sign of trouble, especially if you have fibromyalgia. For people
with FMS, this simple equation is very important: Less sleep = more pain.
192

In general, people with FMS may have one or all of the following sleep 
difficulties:
 Difficulty falling asleep
 Frequent awakenings
 Lack of deep, restorative sleep
It’s 2 a.m. and I’m still awake: 
Difficulty falling asleep
You’ve been trying as hard as you can to get yourself to sleep, but your brain
just won’t cooperate! Instead, it keeps wanting you to think about that prob-
lem with the report you were working on today, the bully at school who’s
harassing your child, and so many other problems. “Sleep now!” you order
yourself — except your body won’t cooperate. As you get angrier and more
frustrated, the probability of falling asleep soon decreases.
The answer in this situation: Get up, get a drink of water, walk around, and
then lie down when you feel like it. Don’t be mad at yourself for not falling
asleep and don’t blame your boss, the nasty kid at school, or anyone else. Be
philosophical: These things happen. If insomnia occurs night after night,
however, it’ll start wearing on your brain and your body, and your fibromyal-
gia may get worse. Read this chapter carefully and follow my advice.
Too many wake-up calls: You’re 
constantly waking
Another problem many people have is that they fall asleep okay, but they
keep waking up. Someone flushes the toilet, and they wake up. They hear a
bird chirp, and the sound acts as an untimely wake-up call. It almost seems
like a leaf could fall off a tree and wake them up. If you have this problem,
you’re clearly not getting enough deep sleep.
What can help? A white-noise generator that makes a kind of sshhhh sound
can help you tune out that noisy world and fall deeply asleep. Soft music on
the radio may help lull you to sleep. Some people can benefit from deep-
breathing exercises, meditation, or relaxation therapy. (Read Chapter 13 for
more information on these techniques.)
Be sure to use the most comfortable mattress that you can find. Sometimes
waterbeds are a great solution to help you relax and fall deeply asleep. Some
people like cotton flannel sheets because they’re cool in the summer and
warm in the winter. Check other aspects of your environment as well. For
193
Chapter 14: Sweet Dreams! Combating Sleep Disorders

example, is the room too hot or too cold, even if only slightly? If you’re
uncomfortable, do something to fix the situation and see if that helps you
relax.
Not enough downtime in deep sleep
Even when you finally fall asleep, you may spend the night tossing and turn-
ing in the early sleep stages, and experience an insufficient time in the kind of
deep, restorative sleep that your body truly needs. In fact, studies indicate
that some people with fibromyalgia suffer from a lack of time in deep sleep.
The more you relax (which I know is often not easy!), the more likely you are
to achieve a deep, restorative sleep state. Research has shown that, for some
people, tricyclic antidepressants, such as Elavil, may help to prolong sleep
stages 3 and 4. If tricyclic antidepressants don’t work, Prozac (generic name:
fluoxetine), another type of antidepressant, helps some people. (For more on
these medications, check out “Taking prescriptions for sleepyland,” later in
this chapter.)
Analyzing Your Sleep: A Self-Test
Answer “true” or “false” to the following eight questions to determine if you
or someone you care about may have a sleep problem. And be honest!
Nobody but you needs to know your answers.
1. On most nights, falling asleep takes me an hour or more.
2. After I fall asleep, I sleep at least seven or eight hours. If I wake up, I
fall back to sleep again easily.
194

Dream on
Whether dreams have important messages to
sleepers is an issue that’s been debated for mil-
lennia. Some people believe that dreams are
like garbage from the brain, akin to the waste
material excreted after food is processed by the
digestive system. Others believe that dreams
hold very important meanings for the dreamer
and should be pursued.
I don’t know which point of view is right about
the significance of dreaming, but I do know that
having dreams is important. In experiments in
which people were deprived of dreaming (by
being wakened when a REM stage was
detected), the subjects became very irritable
and angry. People with fibromyalgia, like every-
one else, need to dream.

3. I rely on at least several drinks of beer, wine, or another form of alco-
hol before bed.
4. I consider myself a light sleeper.
5. My partner says that I snore.
6. When I wake up in the morning, I feel refreshed.
7. I take naps on the weekend.
8. I like watching scary or exciting TV programs before bed.
What do your answers mean? Let’s take them one by one.
If you answered “true” to question 1, you have plenty of company — and you
also have a sleep problem.
Lisa was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about a year ago, and she says that on
most nights, she just lies in bed and can’t sleep. The hours pass from 11 p.m.
to 2 a.m., but she feels almost more wide awake than she did at noon. She
wonders what’s wrong with her. Part of Lisa’s problem may be that she’s just
trying too hard to fall asleep. Ironically, the harder she tries, the angrier and
more frustrated she gets and the less likely she is to fall asleep. Ease up, Lisa!
She (and maybe you) needs to try some of the sleep remedies provided later
in this chapter.
If you answered “true” to question 2, good for you! Keep up the good work.
Maybe you have some good sleep tips that you can share with your fellow
fibromyalgia sufferers.
If you answered “true” to question 3, you need to break this habit as soon as
possible. One glass of beer or wine may be a good way to get to sleep for
some people. But having more than one glass of beer or wine, as well as
drinking any other forms of alcohol, is definitely not a smart choice. You’re
far more likely to wake up, dehydrated and headachy, around 1 or 2 a.m. with
a bad case of insomnia.
If you answered “true” to question 4, you may be a person who isn’t getting
enough sleep. Do you ever feel truly rested in the morning? If not, you need
to try my sleep suggestions later in this chapter.

Chapter 14: Sweet Dreams! Combating Sleep Disorders
Lack of exercise can impede sleep
Maybe you haven’t been exercising much (or at
all) because of your pain and fatigue. But if you
can manage some light exercise, such as a short
walk an hour or two before bedtime, this activity
could help you get to sleep easier. Be sure to
read Chapter 15 for more information on how
exercising can improve your FMS symptoms.

Did you answer “true” to question 5? If so, you may have sleep apnea. Sleep
apnea is a dangerous condition by itself. It’s also bad because the lack of
sleep that this condition induces can also increase the pain of fibromyalgia.
Talk to your doctor about resolving this problem.
If you answered “true” to question 6, and you wake up in the morning feeling
refreshed, that’s great! Sounds like you’re doing the right thing. Whatever it
is, keep doing it.
If your answer to question 7 was “true,” I have to tell you that taking naps on
the weekend is a no-no for the person with fibromyalgia — unless a daily
siesta is your status quo. If you make naps a weekend-only habit, you may
disrupt your sleep cycle. Whenever possible, maintain the same sleep hours
(within an hour or two) on weeknights and weekends. You should get up at
about the same time every day and go to bed at about the same time every
night. This habit is especially important for people with sleep problems —
with or without fibromyalgia.
If you answered “true” to question 8, and you become excited or upset by
scary or violent movies, but you don’t want to give them up, avoid watching
them before bedtime. Watch a DVD of Saw III on Saturday afternoon instead
of late at night.
Most people don’t get enough refreshing sleep, and people with fibromyalgia
aren’t alone in being sleep deprived. According to a survey performed by the
National Sleep Foundation in 2000, two-thirds of 1,000 people reported having
trouble sleeping at least a few times a week. In fact, sometimes the sleep
deprivation is voluntary. Nearly half (45 percent) said that they’d sacrifice
more sleep if they could get more done. Yet sleep deprivation leads to car
crashes, mistakes at work, and yelling at your kids. A good night’s sleep is
important for everyone, and it’s especially vital for people with FMS.

Understanding sleep apnea
Infrequently, sleep apnea is the cause of fatigue
or daytime sleepiness. Sleep apnea is a medical
problem that causes people (especially people
who are overweight) to actually stop breathing
while they’re asleep. Although each apnea
episode lasts for only a short period, and the
breathing eventually gets jump-started again by
the brain, people can suffer from dozens of these
episodes each hour. These lapses of breathing,
when added together, can be dangerous for
people. In some cases, they can cause heart or
lung problems and even be fatal. If your spouse
commonly complains that your snoring can be
heard in other rooms of the house, or you con-
stantly wake up with choking and coughing, you
may have an allergy or a problem with sleep
apnea. See your doctor to find out, and if you
have this problem, get treatment for it.

Adjusting Your Lifestyle to 
Cope with the Problem
Medications can help you fall asleep and sleep peacefully through the night (I
discuss drugs in the next section, “Slipping into Slumber Using Medications
and Other Remedies”). But you can also make simple changes in your life that
will often help carry you off into the wonderful world of sleep. The following
are some good lifestyle options:
 Pay attention to what you eat and drink at dinnertime and afterward.
 Discover how to relax. (Read more about relaxation therapy in Chapter 13.)
 Accept that your bed is for sleeping only. (Okay, it’s for sex, too. But
that’s it!) Do your working, reading, and TV watching elsewhere.
 Encourage a snoring partner to get help. If he refuses to get help, con-
sider using earplugs or a white-noise machine to help cancel out the
noise.
Consuming soporific suppers
If you suffer from insomnia, avoid eating a fashionably late dinner; stop eating
at least three hours before bed. Also, be sure to take other basic steps that
can facilitate sleep. For example, avoid all caffeine (coffee, tea, cola drinks,
and chocolate) starting six to seven hours before bedtime, so your system
won’t be overstimulated when it’s time to fall asleep. Consider eating foods
that are known to be rich in natural tryptophan, a chemical that induces
sleep. Turkey’s packed with it. Milk also has this substance, although in lower
quantities than turkey has.
Eating a few pieces of turkey or a turkey sandwich, combined with a glass of
milk, an hour before you want to go to sleep may relax you enough to help
you nod off without (or with less) difficulty. Of course, be sure not to overeat,
which can defeat your purpose because you may get a stomachache and find
it even more difficult to fall asleep. And be sure not to rationalize to yourself
that a slice of pizza or a dish of ice cream before bed will help you relax and
fall asleep. It won’t!
Relaxing
Falling asleep is nearly impossible when your body is tense from the day’s
battles and problems. But you can discover how to relax, whether through
197
Chapter 14: Sweet Dreams! Combating Sleep Disorders

deep breathing (relaxation therapy (see Chapter 13), or special relaxing exer-
cises, such as Chinese tai chi (see Chapter 12). The point is, relaxation isn’t
bad; it’s absolutely necessary. Yet in our achievement-oriented society, where
many people think every nanosecond must be a productive one, relaxation
may be a tough concept to accept as being good.
Think of it this way: Even machines need some downtime. Your body is a
wonderful and unique kind of biological machine, and it definitely needs
some time off from intensive efforts. And it needs that time off every day. It
needs restorative sleep. And besides, good sleep can enable more productiv-
ity the next day. Don’t deny yourself this important need.
Using your bed for sleeping (and sex)
Your bed is for sleeping. This statement may sound obvious, but too many
people don’t grasp this simple point. Your bed really isn’t a good place to
read books, grade papers, or perform other nonrestful activities. With the
exception of sexual activities (which are also good for your body and may
help you sleep deeply), do nothing in your bed except sleep. Perform your
other activities elsewhere.
Quieting a snoring partner
What if you’re not the one who’s snoring, but your partner is? Encourage her
to get help. Your partner may have sleep apnea, a sinus infection, or some
other medical problem. The snoring is also disrupting your sleep! Resolving
this snoring problem can help you both.
Slipping into Slumber Using Medications
and Other Remedies
Sometimes, you try lifestyle changes, limit your heavy meals, and follow my
other good suggestions in this chapter and this book, but you’re still not reg-
istering enough Zs. You may need to try a sleep medication. Over-the-counter
medicines, alternative remedies, and prescribed medicines are all available
today and just may help you.
198
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

Buying nonprescription medicines
You can purchase over-the-counter sleep remedies at your pharmacy or even
your supermarket. Most of these drugs have the same ingredients as antihist-
amines (cold and allergy medicines). They may make you a little drowsy, but
generally, they have a limited effectiveness at inducing sleep. In most cases,
when they do induce sleep, these medications fail to deliver significant
restorative sleep to their users. They can cause constipation, dry mouth, and
other side effects. They may also cause rebound insomnia, which means that
these medicines actually cause you to have insomnia if you stop taking the
medicine. If you have insomnia, you need a sleep remedy, not an allergy drug.
If you do decide to use an over-the-counter sleep remedy, be sure to read the
instructions on the package and any inserts first. You don’t want to risk
having the drug interact with other medications you may be taking for
fibromyalgia or other illnesses. If possible, ask your doctor if he recommends
this medicine or considers it safe. You can also call the doctor’s office and
ask the nurse to ask the physician for you.
Using helpful alternative remedies
Alternative remedies to the standard over-the-counter medications are effec-
tive in helping some people get to sleep. Some key alternative remedies are
valerian, kava kava, and melatonin.
Be sure to let your doctor know that you plan to take or are already taking
herbal medicines or other supplements. These alternative remedies can
interact with other medicines you’re taking.
Valerian
Clinical studies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany on
the use of valerian as a mild sedative have proven that this herbal root does
help some people with their insomnia. Studies also indicate that valerian
doesn’t appear to affect sleep stages negatively or to impede the concentra-
tion or reactions of users on the day after they use it.
According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, valerian may boost
the effects of some antiseizure medicines. If you take an antiseizure medicine,
be sure to ask your doctor if you can safely take valerian. Better yet, try a dif-
ferent remedy.
199
Chapter 14: Sweet Dreams! Combating Sleep Disorders

Kava kava
What about the herbal remedy kava kava? People have used this herb (also
known as Piper methysticum) for problems of insomnia, stress, anxiety, and
premenstrual syndrome. In a study reported in Phytotherapy Research in 2001,
researchers treated subjects who suffered from stress-induced insomnia with
kava kava for several weeks and then treated them with valerian. The
researchers found that both herbs were effective. The most frequent side
effect found with valerian was vivid dreams, experienced by 16 percent of the
subjects. The most frequent side effect experienced with kava kava was dizzi-
ness, experienced by 12 percent of the subjects.
In late 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that
some people in Europe who’ve used kava kava have experienced severe liver
toxicity (damage to the liver, a crucial organ that you can’t live without), suf-
fering from such problems as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and even liver failure. In
addition, the FDA also received reports on Americans experiencing liver
problems with taking kava kava.
Melatonin
The hormone melatonin has proven effective at helping some people get to
sleep, and studies indicate that melatonin may be especially helpful for trav-
elers who are plagued with problems of jetlag. The drug appears to reset the
natural body rhythm of the user. Your body actually produces melatonin nat-
urally (it’s produced by the pineal gland in your brain). But you may need an
extra boost from nature from time to time, and taking supplemental mela-
tonin may help you. Keep in mind, however, that melatonin has been
reported to cause headaches, stomachaches, strange dreams, and even
depression in some people.
Taking prescriptions for sleepyland
Are prescribed medications for sleep safe? In most cases, yes — although you
should pay attention to your doctor’s warnings about side effects, the dose
you should take, and any other warnings your doctor gives you. Also ask
your pharmacist about any side effects or potential interactions with other
medications you’re taking.
The key medications that are prescribed to help people sleep are
 Prescribed sleep remedies
 Antidepressant medications
 Anti-anxiety drugs
 Fibromyalgia medications that also induce sleep
200
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

Prescribed sleep remedies
Approved by the FDA in 1992, Ambien (generic name: zolpidem) was the first
prescribed drug created specifically for insomniacs in the United States.
Since then, other drugs have become available for insomniacs, including
Lunesta (generic name: eszoplicone) and Sonata (generic name: zaleplon).
These medications are classified as Schedule IV drugs under the Controlled
Substances Act, which means that they have a low risk for abuse compared
to other scheduled drugs, such as most narcotics, which are Schedule II
drugs. (Read more about scheduled drugs in Chapter 10.) A newer prescribed
sleep remedy that is not a scheduled drug is Rozarem (ramelton), a medica-
tion that works in about an hour — if it works.
These sleep remedies may increase depression and memory problems, and
sleepiness may be prolonged in some people.
Don’t take sedating medications during daylight hours unless you can stay
home. Don’t even think about driving a car or operating any type of equip-
ment beyond perhaps turning on your computer.
Antidepressants
Doctors frequently prescribe antidepressant medications for people with
fibromyalgia. These drugs are not usually prescribed in a high enough dose
to treat someone with depression; instead, doctors order them at a lower
dose to help induce sleep and also to ease pain from fibromyalgia or other
medical problems.
Drugs, such as Elavil (generic name: amitriptyline) and Desyrel (generic
name: trazodone) make most people tired, and they fall asleep. The downside
is that these drugs may also cause weight gain and a “druggy” feeling the next
day in some people. Dry eyes and mouth are other side effects that can
occur.
201
Chapter 14: Sweet Dreams! Combating Sleep Disorders
Melatonin may help with pain and depression, too
Some studies have shown that taking melatonin,
an over-the-counter supplement, may not only
normalize the sleep cycle of people with
fibromyalgia, but also decrease their pain and
depression. Melatonin may reduce the anxiety
caused by sleeplessness and it also has sedative
effects, which help to reestablish the circadian
sleep cycle. Melatonin may also normalize
neurotransmitters and, thus, reduce pain. Some
studies have shown efficacy with a dosage of 
3 mg of melatonin. As with any medication, talk
to your doctor first before trying melatonin.

Prozac (generic name: fluoxetine) may help some people achieve a deeper
sleep if other antidepressants don’t work well. One rather unfortunate side
effect is that Prozac may inhibit orgasm in some people.
Anti-anxiety drugs
Sometimes people with serious sleep problems are prescribed anti-anxiety
drugs, also known as benzodiazepines. When the problem is insomnia, some
anti-anxiety drugs may be helpful, including Restoril (generic name:
temazepam), ProSom (generic name: estazolam), and Halcion (generic name:
triazolam). As with specific sleep remedies, these medications are Schedule
IV drugs; thus, they have some risk to be habit-forming. Pregnant women
should avoid them, as should patients with sleep apnea or impaired respira-
tion or anyone with glaucoma. Don’t take these medications with sedating
supplements, such as chamomile, melatonin, kava kava, or valerian.
Other sleep-inducing medications
Some pain medications that doctors prescribe for people with fibromyalgia
also induce sedation, so doctors may feel that they’re conquering two prob-
lems with one drug. (Read more on medications in Chapter 10.) Flexeril
(generic name: cyclobenzaprine) is a muscle relaxant that makes many users
feel drowsy. Ultram (generic name: tramadol) is another effective pain medi-
cation that also has sedating effects.
Most patients take these drugs at night because of their sedative effects, even
when the medications are taken primarily to control pain. If they’re taken
during the day, patients must usually refrain from performing tasks that
require high alertness.

Chapter 15
Exercising, Losing Weight, and
Avoiding Trigger Foods and Drinks
In This Chapter
 Exercising and how it can improve how you feel
 Working on weight loss to decrease pain
 Staying away from foods that may worsen your pain
You’ve heard it all before: You should exercise, lose weight, and do all
that boring and hard stuff that most doctors constantly urge so many
patients to do. But the reality is, they’re right!
Exercising and losing weight (if you’re overweight) really can help you feel
better by decreasing your fibromyalgia pain, fatigue, and muscle stiffness.
And here’s a little secret: You don’t have to exercise to the point of exhaus-
tion, nor do you have to lose great amounts of weight to feel better.
This chapter talks about several important lifestyle changes that you can
make to gain more control over your fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) symptoms.
First, I cover the benefits of exercising. I also include some basic do’s and
don’ts on exercising and provide four simple exercises to try. Next, I cover
weight loss, providing a chart to determine for yourself whether you need to
lose weight. I also cover popular prescribed diet drugs and their basic pros
and cons. Finally, I cover dietary hyperstimulants, a made-up word for food
substances that some experts believe can aggravate your FMS symptoms. You
may find that avoiding these substances will help improve your condition.
Exercising to Relieve Fibromyalgia Pain
Most people associate painkilling with a variety of over-the-counter or pre-
scribed medications. But drugs aren’t the only means to improving your
fibromyalgia symptoms. Getting physical by starting a plan of exercising can
work well, too, although exercising may seem like a sort of strange way to

gain pain relief. Gentle, low-stress, paced exercising can make you feel better,
loosening muscles and greasing your stiff joints and possibly acting as a pre-
ventive measure to ease your pain down the road.
Some studies have indicated that people with fibromyalgia have a fitness
level that’s significantly lower than levels found among people who don’t
have fibromyalgia. (Not that amazing when you think about it — people with
FMS generally feel pretty bad, so are less likely to be physically fit.) Regular
exercise may help people with FMS to close that gap, although not in a few
days or even in a few weeks. Be patient and persistent, and you’ll get there.
Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you gear up to exercise:
 Create a basic fitness program that suits your needs. Realize also that 
if you were more athletic in the past, as many people with fibromyalgia
report that they were, that was then. Make a plan that works for you now.
 Set a realistic goal. Whether exercise goals are set by a physician, a
physical therapist, a personal trainer, or anyone else (including you), 
the goals for a person with fibromyalgia shouldn’t be the same as for a
person who doesn’t have fibromyalgia, because people with FMS have a
lower pain tolerance and tire faster than others. Too much exercise, too
fast, can accelerate the pain. Physical expectations need to be scaled
down considerably for the person who has FMS.
Watch out what type of exercises you perform. Research has shown that
static exercise (like weight lifting) compared to dynamic exercise (like
running) can cause significantly increased pain for people with FMS,
although the cause is unknown. Walking and swimming are better exer-
cise choices for people with FMS than weight lifting.
 Consult your physician before you start a new exercise program. Your
doctor may want to check out your overall fitness level with a treadmill
test or other screening measures. She may also listen to your plan, nod
wisely, and then give you the thumbs up, wishing you well.
 Start slowly and steadily build your way up. Start with five minutes a
day, several times a week (except for walking, which can be for longer
periods). Then every four or five days or so, add a minute of exercise.
Keep adding minutes, until you’re up at a half-hour for three to four days
per week. You can also increase the speed at which you perform your
exercises, gauging how fast to go by your own comfort level.
Note: When it comes to walking, many people with FMS should be able
to follow the walking program in the “Walking off the pain and strain of
fibromyalgia” section later in this chapter, walking up to 60 minutes after
12 weeks. However, even daily walks that last only minutes are helpful.
Walking is a moderate, steady type of exercise; you can walk for a longer
period than you can perform reps of strenuous exercises.
204
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

 Keep it simple. Consider the simple exercises offered in this chapter,
which can help you build up strength and cut back your pain level with-
out breaking your bank on expensive gym memberships.
 Don’t overdo it! Now isn’t the time to adopt “No pain, no gain!” as your
motto. It simply doesn’t work for people with fibromyalgia. A little dis-
comfort is okay and sweating is good. But actual pain? Forget it.
Prepare for exercising by drinking plenty of fluids and making sure that you
dress comfortably and appropriately. Skip the spandex pants and tight 
T-shirts. Wear something loose fitting. Wear good, comfortable walking shoes.
Don’t worry about the fashion police. Assume that they’ve taken the day off.
Exploring Pain-Relieving Exercises
An effective exercise designed to alleviate pain over time is simple to perform
and doesn’t take a lot of time, and yet it adequately manipulates the targeted
muscle groups. Here are a few ideas for you to try.
Walking off the pain and 
strain of fibromyalgia
Walking is an excellent and easy exercise for most people, and it’s one that
most people can perform nearly every day. It doesn’t cost anything, and you
decide when the time is right and where you want to walk.
However, when you feel really bad, even walking can be hard to do, and it
may cause you some pain. So you shouldn’t strive for long distances — at
least when you first start your walking program. And don’t strain yourself to
keep up with others who may be in much more of a rush than you are. Pace
yourself. Walk briskly, but don’t push too hard. You know how fast is fast
enough for you.
Table 15-1 shows a walking program for you to try, developed by the National
Heart Lung and Blood Institute. It allows you to build up slowly. Use the pro-
gram as is, or adapt it to your needs. During the warmup portion, walk at a
comfortable pace and work up to a brisk pace for the exercise portion. When
you’re ready for the cool-down, begin walking at a slower pace to get your
heart rate back down.

hbp/prevent/p_active/walk.htm).
After you complete Week 12, gradually increase your brisk walking time to 
60 minutes, 3 or 4 times a week.
Make walking enjoyable by walking with a friend or your dog. Play your
favorite music while you do the exercises in this chapter or other exercises
that you and your doctor have identified as helpful. Headphones allow you to
keep the music to yourself. Go for upbeat, energetic music — whether pop,
hip-hop, show tunes, whatever.
After you’ve become used to walking, you’ll probably actually miss your daily
walk if you have to forego it due to bad weather or some other circumstance.
(No kidding! You’ll start to look forward to your daily workouts.) So, you may
want a plan for walking indoors when the need arises. If bad weather or long
work hours prevent you from walking outside, drive to the nearest shopping
mall and walk several laps around the mall.
Incorporate more walking into other parts of your daily life. For example,
when you go shopping at the supermarket or elsewhere, don’t consider it a
major victory when you can park close to the entrance. Instead, park farther
206
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

away and walk a little farther than usual. A side benefit of parking farther away
is that you won’t have other drivers lined up and eager to take your very close
spot. When you’re out in left field, you can take your time to reach your car,
find your car keys, and get yourself comfortable, and nobody will care.
When you need to enter a building that’s a few stories high, ignore the eleva-
tor and take the stairs instead. It’s great exercise for your heart as well as the
rest of your body. Don’t run up the stairs; take your time.
Be sure that you move around and change positions frequently in your daily
life. Sure, the movie is fascinating, or maybe another project that you’re
working on has you mesmerized. You may feel like (or act as if) you’re glued
to your chair. If so, unstick yourself. At least every 15 to 20 minutes, get up
and move around. And then, if you want, return to the previously intriguing
activity. Moving around more frequently can help abate some of the muscle
stiffness that’s so common for people with fibromyalgia.
Swimming, cycling, and other choices
Swimming, cycling, and strengthening exercises are good for your muscles,
your heart, and your whole body. Getting into shape can be an effective pre-
ventive tactic, helping shield you against future pain and fatigue. You can’t
get a new body (not yet, anyway!). So strengthen the one you have.
Analyzing aquatic exercises: Water works
Aquatic exercises range from making simple movements in the pool all the
way up to swimming laps. So the range of activity choices is considerable.
Aquatic exercises are easier on the body than are exercises performed out of
the water, because water exerts less strain and drag on the body and allows
for a greater freedom of movement. (Less strain and more movement are
great selling points for people with FMS.)
One very simple water exercise is to walk around in the shallow end of the
pool. Keep your arms above the water line, so they don’t create too much
pull and strain on your body.
If you exercise in a swimming pool, the water should be comfortably warm.
Many people with fibromyalgia are very sensitive to cold temperatures and
find it harder to move when they’re immersed in cold (or hot) water. Always
check the temperature of the water with a pool thermometer before jumping
in. Some experts recommend that the water temperature should be set
between 83°F and 90°F. If you use a public pool, ask the staff if they have a
pool thermometer you can borrow to test the temperature, because you’re
207
Chapter 15: Exercising, Losing Weight, and Avoiding Trigger Foods and Drinks

highly sensitive to heat and cold. You can also buy a pool thermometer for a
few dollars in a pool-supply store.
If you want to take a local class in water aerobics in a warm-water pool, 
check your local newspaper for information or contact your local chapter of
the Arthritis Foundation to find information on dates and times of classes
that are offered. If you’re not sure how to find your local chapter, call the
Arthritis Foundation toll free at 800-568-4045 or check its Web site (www.
arthritis.org).
Cycling to symptom reduction
Riding your bike is also a great exercise, even if it’s just around the block. Or
you can use a stationary bike and cycle yourself ahead many “miles” while you
stay in your home and watch your favorite TV shows or a DVD, or while you
listen to music, podcasts, or an audiotape of a book.
Getting stronger with strengthening exercises
If you begin practicing strengthening exercises, such as resistance exercises,
you can build up your body and make it more impervious to pain. However,
avoid weightlifting (using weights of even five pounds) because that may
increase your pain. Note: Avoid exercising muscle groups that are painful.
If you don’t already have one, you may want to buy an inexpensive exercise
mat with some padding, usually available at major sporting goods stores.
Avoid just lying on the hard floor.
The exercise shown in Figure 15-1 helps you strengthen your upper back and
shoulder muscles, often major problem areas for many people with
fibromyalgia. Here’s how to do the exercise:
1. Get down on your hands and knees on an exercise mat with your neck
straight and parallel to the floor.
Don’t do this exercise on a hard floor without a mat.
2. Slowly stretch one arm out in front of you, keeping your arm straight
and parallel to the floor, to about the height of your ear.
Your fingers should point at the wall on the opposite side of the room
and should be together.
3. Hold this position for 5 seconds, if possible. Then slowly return your
arm to its starting position.
4. Repeat the exercise with your other arm.
Aim for ten repetitions on each side, if you can manage that many 
comfortably.
208
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

The exercise shown in Figure 15-2 is effective at toning both your side and
back muscles and can be effective in preventing sudden back spasms that
may result from turning or twisting the wrong way.
1. Stand up straight with your feet about 18 inches apart.
2. Bend your left elbow and place your left hand on your waist.
3. Straighten your right arm over your head while, at the same time,
trying to keep your right shoulder level with your left shoulder.
4. Bend slowly toward the left (toward your bent elbow), keeping your
right arm above your head. Feel the pull in your right side. Hold this
position for the count of five.
Don’t push your right hip to the side as you bend. That can put extra
stress on your knees. It’s also cheating.
5. Slowly return to an upright position.
6. Repeat on the other side.
Try for ten repetitions on each side.
The exercise shown in Figure 15-3 is really good for tightening your abdomi-
nal muscles, the ones that support your lower back. The mini sit-up causes
your abdominals to contract and to hold at the point of maximum resistance,
without overly straining your back and neck muscles.
1. Lie flat on your back on your exercise mat.
2. Bend your knees, keeping your feet flat on the floor.
Your knees should be no more than an inch or two apart.

3. Fold your arms across your chest and raise your head, neck, and
shoulders off the floor.
Your head and neck will curl forward, but they shouldn’t curl forward
enough to cause your chin to be on your chest. (Imagine you have a
tennis ball between your chin and your chest, to help you visualize this.)
4. Suck in your stomach muscles and hold this position for a count of five.
5. Slowly release, and roll back down to your starting position.
Repeat this exercise five times, if possible.

The exercise shown in Figure 15-4 will loosen your hip joint while, at the
same time, stretching your lower back and buttock muscles.
1. Lie on your back on your exercise mat, legs extended and arms at
your sides.
2. Bend your right leg, grab it with both hands just below the knee, and
pull it gently toward your chest as far as you can.
3. Hold your leg at this maximum position for a count of five, making
sure that your other leg is straight and on the floor.
4. Slowly release and repeat the exercise with your left leg.
Try for ten repetitions on each leg, if possible.
Losing Weight to Decrease 
Pain and Fatigue
If you’re carrying around some extra pounds (or maybe a lot of extra weight),
this problem isn’t actually causing your fibromyalgia. However, the additional
weight can worsen the already-existing condition. Conversely, dropping a few
pounds can make you feel significantly better. You don’t have to lose an enor-
mous amount of poundage. You’ll feel and look better as soon as you lose a
few pounds, which can motivate you to continue to lose weight at a slow and
healthy pace until you reach your ideal weight.
Not only will weight loss improve (although not eliminate) your fibromyalgia
symptoms, but weight loss (if you’re overweight) will also decrease your risk
for developing diabetes, hypertension, and many other health problems that
are directly associated with obesity.

Chapter 15: Exercising, Losing Weight, and Avoiding Trigger Foods and Drinks

Give yourself small, doable goals. Even if you need to lose a lot of weight,
shoot for 3 or 4 pounds as your initial goal. When you lose those 3 or 4
pounds, reward yourself (not with food!). Give yourself a small but nice
bonus — maybe buy yourself a new outfit or hit the town for a night of danc-
ing. Give yourself a few days or weeks to maintain that weight and, when you
feel ready, set a new goal to lose another small amount of weight. Each time
you reach your new goal, praise yourself lavishly in your mind. Focus on
what you’ve achieved by losing those 3 or 4 pounds at each new level.
Figuring your ideal weight
How much should you weigh? The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(NHLBI) has devised its own tables of body mass index (BMI), a height/weight
measure. This information provides some basic guidance on how much
weight is too low, just right, and over the top for your height.
You can easily determine your current body mass index by checking Table 15-2,
a table of BMI levels provided by the NHLBI. The BMI is derived from a rather
complicated formula, but you don’t have to drag out your calculator or your
old high school math book to do the equations. The nice people who made 
the chart have done all those calculations for you. (You can also find a handy
online calculator at www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/.)
Note: If you don’t find your height/weight combination in Table 15-2, check
out the online calculator. Another BMI chart is also available at www.nhlbi.
nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl2.htm for BMIs greater than 35.
Find out where you fit on the BMI chart, based on your height and weight.
Then review Table 15-3 to see what your BMI means. In general, if your body
mass index is 25 or greater, you’re considered overweight.
For example, suppose that Mary is 5 feet 4 inches (64 inches) tall, and weighs
174 pounds. Her BMI is 30, which means that Mary is obese. To move down
into the overweight category — which still isn’t great but is better than 
obese — Mary would need to drop down to 169 pounds, a mere 5-pound
weight loss. If Mary then decides that she wants to catapult herself all the way
into the normal range, she would shoot for weighing less than 145 pounds.
Being underweight can be as unhealthy as being overweight. Instead of striv-
ing to look like your favorite movie star or Olsen twin, you want to strive for a
BMI between 18.5 and 24.9.

Improving your diet and exercising 
to shed pounds
Weight-loss medications exist for people who can’t get the pounds off, no
matter what they do (see the following section). But before you resort to pre-
scribed medications and their side effects, work on exercising and changing
your diet. I know, I know, it sounds boring and it’s harder than popping a pill.
But for most people, it’s the best way.
Exercise is good, but pace yourself. Because fibromyalgia is a condition with
frequent ups and downs, you may make the mistake of demanding too much
of yourself on days when you’re feeling better.
Many people associate food with certain behaviors. Change the behavior, and
you can lose weight. For example, if the coffee machine at work always has
sweets around it, get your coffee and leave fast. Or better yet, bring water to
work, and you won’t even have to see the junk food and make a conscious
decision to not eat it. Another idea: Instead of meeting friends for lunch at a
restaurant, meet them at a museum or a park and walk around and chat with
each other. Bring a nutritious picnic lunch to eat outside and enjoy!
Eat slowly and use smaller plates. If you chew your food more slowly, savor-
ing it (but not so slowly that it becomes disgusting), you give your appetite
time to kick in and tell you, “Stop! I’m full!” If you eat in a rush, you’re more
likely to overeat because your appetite hasn’t had a chance to kick in. Using
smaller plates may sound silly, but experts say that it works. Smaller portions
don’t look so small on smaller plates.
Considering some weight-loss meds
What if you’ve tried really hard to lose weight and increased your exercise,
but gotten nowhere? Those pounds hang on like iron filings to a magnet.
214
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

Would using weight-loss drugs help you drop some of those pounds?
Possibly, although you need to consider some pros and cons to their use
before you start taking them. In addition, keep in mind that, despite dramatic
advertising hype that you may read or see on TV, they aren’t miracle drugs.
Many different weight-loss medications are on the market today. Some can 
be bought in your local supermarket or pharmacy and others require a 
prescription.
Some people have reported weight-loss success with Cymbalta, a prescribed
antidepressant (generic name: duloxetine). Cymbalta is not a weight-loss
drug, but in clinical trials, some subjects reported minimal weight loss.
However, some individuals with both depression and a weight problem who
take Cymbalta may enjoy a significant improvement with both problems.
I generally don’t recommend over-the-counter weight-loss meds, despite their
wonderful-sounding promises and the startling “before” and “after” pictures.
The reality is that over-the-counter weight-loss remedies don’t work for most
people, and some remedies (such as some herbal remedies) can be danger-
ous or fatal. Also, in most cases, as soon as you stop taking an over-the-
counter drug for weight loss, the pounds usually pile back on.
As for prescribed medications, the two most popular are Xenical (generic
name: orlistat) and Meridia (generic name: sibutramine). These two drugs
work in different ways to help people lose weight, and are usually only rec-
ommended for obese people, not for those who need to lose a few pounds.
Prescribed diet medications may cause aggravating side effects, such as high
blood pressure and even fecal leakage. Also, you may need to take these med-
icines indefinitely, although their long-term effects of more than a year have
not been tested so far. Even after taking the medication for a long time, you
may experience weight gain after you stop taking the medication. Be sure to
talk frankly with your doctor about prescribed weight-loss medications
before you begin taking one, and be sure to discontinue the use of any over-
the-counter weight-loss remedies while taking prescription weight-loss meds.
People who need to lose only 3 to 5 pounds should never use weight-loss
medicines of any kind. Remember, your weight fluctuates. Some people may
weigh themselves at night, and the next morning, their weight could have
changed by as much as 3 pounds. This is normal.
Researchers are working hard on developing and testing new medications
that may enable people to lose a great deal of weight in the near future, but
these drugs are still in the clinical-testing stage. They’ll probably not be intro-
duced to the general public for at least four or five years, at the earliest.
These drugs seem to work well on laboratory rats, but it’ll take time before
researchers know whether they’re safe and effective when people use them.
215
Chapter 15: Exercising, Losing Weight, and Avoiding Trigger Foods and Drinks

Discovering Dietary Effects: 
Good Foods/Bad Foods
You probably can’t alleviate your fibromyalgia entirely by watching what you
eat. However, studies have indicated that you may be able to reduce your
pain level and even improve your quantity and quality of sleep by plotting a
course toward certain foods and away from others.
People with FMS are different from each other, and no large-scale studies
have found that some foods are good and others should be banned for
people with fibromyalgia, but patterns are emerging. For example, some
fibromyalgia sufferers agree that most fruits and vegetables (especially
berries) and plain cereals are FMS-friendly, but chocolate, citrus fruits, and
foods high in monosodium glutamate (MSG, a chemical regarded as a flavor
enhancer), aspartame (an artificial sweetener), or caffeine aggravate their
FMS symptoms. Check food labels to see whether MSG or aspartame is
included in the product. (You may have a hard time giving up aspartame
because it’s in a wide variety of products, particularly diet soft drinks and
reduced-calorie foods.)
If you find that MSG gives you trouble, when you eat out in restaurants, con-
sider telling the waiter that you’re allergic to MSG, and it should not be added
to your food. (You can also simply request that MSG not be added to your
food, but that request may be ignored. If you say that you’re allergic, your
request is more likely to be heeded. It’s not a total lie — MSG can cause a
flare-up of FMS symptoms.)
As for beverages, plain old water is best. You may think that water is really
boring — but have you checked the water aisle of your supermarket lately?
You can get water with lemon or other flavors added, and with carbonated
water if you like bubbles. If you don’t want fancy water, local tap water will
work just fine.
One way to figure out whether specific foods make your symptoms worse is
to keep a food diary. Each day, write down everything you eat on one side of
a sheet of paper. On the other side of your paper (at the end of the day), list
any symptoms that are worse than usual, such as worsened pain or greater
fatigue. Keep your food diary for at least two weeks, comparing what you ate
with how you felt. If you notice that you felt worse when you ate ice cream
and milk and had whipped cream on your pie, maybe dairy products are a
problem for you. If you felt bad when you ate pecan pie, maybe nuts bother
you. If you start to see a pattern, eliminate the suspicious food for a week or
two and notice if you feel any different. If you feel better without it, that food
may be a problem for you and should go on your “avoid” list.

F
ibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) can be so painful, with symptoms so dis-
tressing, that the illness drives people into depression or anxiety.
Depression and/or anxiety can worsen pain and other symptoms of
fibromyalgia. Confronting emotional difficulties and seeking help is a much
better strategy than denying or wishing them away. This active coping strat-
egy can also lead to significant improvement of your FMS symptoms.
In this chapter, I cover common emotional problems faced by people with
fibromyalgia. First I cover depression because people with fibromyalgia are
often depressed. I help you identify symptoms of depression and offer advice
on resolving it. Anxiety disorders are also common among people with FMS.
This chapter offers advice on what to do if anxiety overwhelms you.
You may have trouble recognizing your emotional status because people
often become emotionally numbed by problems. I offer a self-test to take your
“emotional temperature,” explaining what your answers may mean and what
to do about them. I also talk about finding a therapist and cover key psychi-
atric medications for depression or anxiety.
Dealing with Depression
Depression is more widespread than most people realize, and many people
experience clinical depression at some point in their lives — whether they
have fibromyalgia or not. But people suffering from fibromyalgia are particu-
larly vulnerable to this illness.

Defining depression and its symptoms
Depression is an extreme form of sadness that manifests in feelings of contin-
ued and severe hopelessness or helplessness. People throw around the word
depressed to denote having a bad day, but depression is much more intense
and long-lasting.
Depression manifests differently in different people. Some people cry; others
yell or behave aggressively. Here are some symptoms of possible depression:
 An appetite change causing a gain or loss of 10 pounds or more in a
month
 Frequent thoughts of suicide and/or a plan for suicide
 Lack of interest in activities that were considered pleasurable in the past
 A dramatic drop in energy and activity levels
 Extreme guilt
 A continued sense of hopelessness
 Excessive agitation or anger
 Sleeping excessively or difficulty sleeping
If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or therapist. (Turn to
“Taking Your Emotional Temperature” in this chapter for more insights.)
Connecting fibromyalgia 
and clinical depression
The majority of people with fibromyalgia suffer some level of chronic depres-
sion. Which came first — fibromyalgia or depression — isn’t always clear.
What’s important is identifying depression if it does appear and working to
control it. Physicians say depression is one of the most treatable emotional
problems around. It doesn’t get better on its own — it requires work.
Depression is more likely to occur with your fibromyalgia if you have a close
family member with depression or you’ve been depressed in the past.
Treating depression
Linda says she stopped listening to her children and her husband, and spent
most days in a fog of despair. She couldn’t work, so she stayed home — she’s
not really sure what happened on those days. The pain and fatigue from
218
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

fibromyalgia, combined with her depression, made life almost unbearable.
Linda’s husband insisted she see a psychiatrist, and she agreed.
The psychiatrist diagnosed depression and placed Linda on Cymbalta
(generic name: duloxetine), an antidepressant that increases blood levels of
serotonin and norepinephrine, brain chemicals related to mood. Cymbalta
has also proven effective at decreasing both depression and chronic pain.
Linda’s doctor recommended that she start a daily walking program and urged
her to see a pain specialist to get her pain under control. Within a few weeks
of following the doctor’s orders, and seeing a rheumatologist experienced at
treating FMS, Linda’s depression began to lift, her pain levels dropped, and
she began to believe that she could manage this fibromyalgia thing.
Many depressed people need to talk about emotional problems with a psychi-
atrist or a psychologist to resolve them. (Check out the “Finding a Therapist”
section, later in this chapter, for more information.)
Cognitive-behavioral therapy 
and fibromyalgia
Therapy often helps people with fibromyalgia and depression or anxiety.
Studies of individuals with both an anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia have
revealed that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), in which the therapist
teaches patients to identify and challenge self-defeating ideas, is effective. 
In clinical studies, CBT has proven to reduce pain intensity.
Determining If It’s an Anxiety Disorder
Your emotional problem may not be depression at all. Instead, you may have
an anxiety disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH), 40 million American adults suffer from an anxiety disorder. You may
have one or more anxiety disorders — but they’re all treatable.
Defining anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorders come in many forms. In the following sections, I outline the
most common, their symptoms, and how they are treated.
219
Chapter 16: Coping with Emotions: Your Own

Generalized anxiety disorder
Many people (about 6.8 million adults in the United States, according to the
NIMH) suffer powerlessness, compounded with foreboding caused by gener-
alized anxiety disorder (GAD). They suffer from relentless worry and fear and
may have nausea, muscle aches, fatigue, and irritability. GAD differs from
depression, a feeling of emotional flatness and hopelessness. Think of the
anxious person as running around in circles, while the depressed person lies
on the couch, having given up.
Chronic-panic disorder
Some individuals (about 6 million adults in the United States, according to
the NIMH), including some patients with FMS, suffer from chronic-panic dis-
order, characterized by panic attacks with a racing heart and a feeling of
impending doom. They may experience profuse sweating and think they’re
having a heart attack, increasing their anxiety further.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder
According to the NIMH, about 2.2 million American adults suffer from 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People with OCD may constantly
count things or wash their hands, among other symptoms. They can’t stop
themselves. TV’s Monk is an example of a person with OCD.
Post-traumatic stress disorder
According to the NIMH, about 7.7 million American adults suffer from post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Individuals with PTSD may periodically
relive former traumatic experiences, such as combat, sexual assaults, child-
hood abuse, or other events. They may also become emotionally empty.
PTSD increases the risk for fibromyalgia. In a study of 1,259 female military
veterans with and without PTSD (reported in Archives of Internal Medicine in
2004), the 266 female vets with PTSD had a greater rate of fibromyalgia (19.2
percent) than female vets without PTSD (8 percent).
Treating anxiety disorders
Tina has fibromyalgia, and has suffered from frequent occurrences of her
heart racing uncontrollably and feeling faint. But the doctor said that her
heart was fine. Tina consulted a therapist and learned to avoid panicking
over minor problems. She became more proactive about resolving her FMS
with relaxation therapy. (Read about relaxation therapy in Chapter 13.)
Many people benefit from both medication and therapy. In addition, many
find solace in talking to others with similar problems. (Read about support
groups in Chapter 18.) Others find that one-on-one sessions with therapists
work for them (see the “Finding a Therapist” section later in this chapter).

Sorting out anxiety versus depression
Many people are confused about the difference between depression and 
anxiety. Aren’t depressed people anxious? And aren’t anxious people
depressed? Yes, some people are depressed and anxious. But there are differ-
ences. Table 16-1 compares the emotional and physical symptoms of general-
ized anxiety disorder, depression, and fibromyalgia. For example, people 
with GAD may sleep less because they’re so worried. In contrast, depressed
people may sleep less or more than usual. Those with fibromyalgia only may
experience less sleep.

Taking Your Emotional Temperature
You know how to take your body temperature. What about your emotional
temperature? How you feel directly affects your fibromyalgia symptoms. This
section covers taking your emotional temperature.
221
Chapter 16: Coping with Emotions: Your Own

In the preceding sections, I talk about depression and several forms of anxi-
ety disorders, but in this section, I offer everyday examples of emotional dis-
tress. If any of these situations describes your emotional state, you may be
experiencing depression or anxiety:
 Nearly every morning, I feel like crying or screaming. If you wake 
up sad, you may be depressed. If you feel so anxious that you want to
scream, you may have an anxiety disorder. When you have fibromyalgia,
the pain and insomnia may be making you down or anxious. Or you may
have FMS symptoms and depression or anxiety. Talk to your doctor.
 My family and friends constantly ask if I’m okay. If your family and
friends keep asking if you’re okay, maybe they’ve noticed you never
smile and seem distressed or agitated. Pay attention. Maybe you’re get-
ting a warning signal to heed. Talk to a doctor or therapist about this.
 At least several times a week, I wonder if my life is worth living. All
people wonder sometimes about their value to the cosmos. But if you
constantly question your personal self-worth, you may be in or headed
for depression. If you’ve considered suicide, see a doctor or therapist
right away.
 I feel like a robot. I get up, go to work, and come home. It’s so joyless.
If your life is only shades of gray, this may indicate depression. It’s also 
a sign that you need a break. Change some patterns in your life. Call a
friend and go out. If this idea has no appeal, see a therapist.
 I can’t think of anything that makes me really excited and happy. If
nothing makes you happy, and even thinking about activities that you
used to like give you no reaction, you’re either depressed or anxious.
You could also be both depressed and anxious. See a doctor or therapist.
 Many times, I feel if one more person annoys me, I may explode.
Anger is one way to exhibit depression or anxiety. If minor slights make
you want to put your fist through a door, see a therapist now.
 I’ve been eating more (or less), and my weight has changed consider-
ably in the past months. Over- or undereating can indicate depression
or anxiety. If you haven’t tried to gain or lose weight, but it’s happening
anyway, see your doctor. If medical problems are ruled out, a therapist is
often your next best choice.
 If a genie offered three wishes, I’d have trouble thinking of two
requests — or one. If you can’t think of one or two things you’d want if
three magic wishes were offered, you may be depressed. Get a physical
exam to rule out hypothyroidism or other medical problems. If the tests
are normal, see a therapist.

Finding a Therapist
When looking for a therapist, you’ll find many different therapists with differ-
ent orientations. The key is to find a therapist who understands your particu-
lar problems, and can help you create a plan to deal with them as effectively
as possible.
No matter who you decide to work with, the therapist needs to accept that
FMS is real. Your anxiety or depression may exacerbate pain and other symp-
toms. Conversely, fibromyalgia may worsen emotional symptoms. If the ther-
apist has experience working with patients with FMS, fine. You may also do
well with a therapist willing to learn about fibromyalgia.
Suppose you’ve found a good, credentialed therapist. Will she make your
problems go away? Therapists aren’t superhuman, but often know ways to
help manage problems. Resolving emotional problems takes time, at least five
to six sessions, at a minimum.
Identifying different types of 
mental-health professionals
Many people are confused by which professionals provide help for emotional
problems. There are four primary types of helping professionals, and they
vary according to their education and types of patients they treat. They have
other differences as well. In the following sections, I spell it all out.
Psychiatrists
Psychiatrists are medical doctors who treat emotional problems; they’re the
only therapists in this section who can prescribe medication. Most psychia-
trists treat a broad range of emotional problems. An initial evaluation may
take an hour, but a “medication check” for established patients may last a 
few minutes.
Psychologists
These are individuals with PhDs or doctorates in psychology or counseling.
Psychologists may specialize in treating specific types of problems, or may
be generalists. Psychologists use many different types of therapies; however,
the most effective one appears to be cognitive-behavioral therapy (see
“Cognitive-behavioral therapy and fibromyalgia,” earlier in this chapter).
223
Chapter 16: Coping with Emotions: Your Own

Social workers
Social workers have master’s degrees (and sometimes doctorates) in social
work. Social workers are interested in practical ways to resolve problems.
They may be adept at analyzing family relationships and helping individuals
get along better.
Other therapists
Some therapists have master’s degrees in psychology or counseling. Check
whether a therapist you’re considering has a professional license with the
state licensing board. (Most state licensing boards are at a department of
professional regulation in your state capital.)
Finding and screening therapists
Suppose you don’t know how to find a therapist. Where do you start?
 Ask your doctor. The doctor won’t tell the world you need a shrink.
Doctors must hold your information in confidence.
 Call the state Mental Health Association office, usually in your state
capital, for a recommendation. Find the nearest office in the United
States at www.nmha.org/affiliates/directory/index.cfm.
 Ask your clergyperson for a recommendation.
 If they’re willing to help, ask your family and friends if they can recom-
mend a therapist.
Meeting with a therapist
The first time you meet a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other therapist, make
the following determinations:
 Do I feel comfortable with the therapist, and think she may help me?
If not, find another therapist.
 Does the therapist have experience with pain patients? Find out during
the session, because the information may not come out otherwise.
 What type of therapy does the therapist perform? Ask the therapist.
Keep in mind that cognitive-behavioral therapy is proven to be effective.
224
Part IV: Modifying Your Lifestyle: Small Changes, Big Results 

Treating Emotional Problems 
with Medication
Some people think the right pill will cure anything, while others think medica-
tions (especially psychiatric drugs) should be avoided. The reality is some-
where in the middle. Medications for emotional disorders can provide
considerable relief, but rarely provide a cure. Other actions are often needed,
such as psychotherapy, exercise, sufficient sleep, stress reduction, and so
forth. That said, medications for emotional problems can be lifesavers.
Just because medications for emotional problems are needed doesn’t mean
they’re free of side effects. (Check out Chapter 10 for common side effects
with antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications.)
Telling yourself to forget problems or smile through your tears isn’t usually
effective, unless the problem is a temporary bad mood. Antidepressant medi-
cations may help alleviate depression, and anti-anxiety drugs may help
squelch anxiety.
You may need one or more drugs to combat emotional difficulties, and your
doctor may try several medications (usually one at a time) before finding one
that works. She’ll probably start you on a low dose of one drug, to tell which
drug is responsible if side effects occur. Check out Table 16-2 for a list of
medications for depression and anxiety and common side effects.

Antidepressant medications may have extra benefits for people with FMS:
 Depression increases the experience of pain, possibly from depletion of
serotonin and/or norepinephrine. Even if you’re not depressed, antide-
pressants can improve serotonin production and decrease pain.
Nonpsychiatrist physicians often prescribe low doses of antidepressants
to patients with chronic pain. (Read more about antidepressants in
Chapter 10.) But if you have depression and chronic pain, you may need
a therapeutic dose to deal with both problems.
 People with fibromyalgia often don’t get enough restorative sleep. Anti-
depressants or sleep remedies may help resolve this problem. (Read
Chapter 14 on sleep problems and what to do about them.)

Part V
Managing
Fibromyalgia at
Work and at Home

In this part . . .
B
ecause fibromyalgia affects you pretty much 24/7,
both on the job and at home, this part addresses
both arenas of your life. In Chapter 17, I cover fibromyal-
gia on the job and what to do if your symptoms bother
you so much that it’s hard (or impossible) to work any-
more. I also offer tactics on coping with your insurance
company, your boss, your co-workers, and others.
Face it: Your fibromyalgia affects your family. In Chapter
18, I explain how your fibromyalgia affects your loved
ones and offer advice, including how to explain fibromyal-
gia to your children, what to do about your (possibly)
impaired sex life, and other key issues.
Chapter 19 is for non-fibromyalgia people: those who
don’t have the problem but really want to help friends and
family members who do. I provide comments from people
who have fibromyalgia on what they wish others would
know, and offer helpful hints on what to say (and not say)
to a person with fibromyalgia. If you have fibromyalgia,
you may want to discreetly leave the book open to this
chapter for some key people in your life.
I also include a chapter on fibromyalgia in children and
adolescents. Yes, they can and do suffer from this aggra-
vating medical problem — yet so often, children and
teenagers suffer because they go undiagnosed. I hope
Chapter 20 will help rectify that problem.

 Identifying and interviewing an attorney to help you
E
va hasn’t told her boss about her fibromyalgia yet, and nobody else in
the company knows about it so far, either. Eva’s keeping her fibromyalgia
a big secret, afraid that she won’t be allowed to do her job if people at work
know about her fibromyalgia. Eva often works alone, using a company-owned
all-terrain vehicle to get to remote work sites where she does her field
research. The vehicle has broken down a few times, and she’s had to hike out
of the wilderness to get help on more than one occasion. Eva’s afraid that if
the boss knew about her medical problems, he wouldn’t allow her in the field
alone — and Eva may be right.
Eva also performs extremely detailed work, and sometimes the fibro fog (diffi-
culty concentrating) is so thick upon her that she has to double- and triple-
check her work. So far, Eva’s careful work has paid off, and she hasn’t made
any mistakes. But she fears that just the possibility that she may make mis-
takes is another reason not to tell anyone about her fibromyalgia.
Is Eva right or wrong about not telling her boss about her fibromyalgia?
That’s a tough call to make. She’s doing her job well, and so far, nobody’s
even suspected that she has a problem. However, Eva worries about “what 
if” — so much so that her overall quality of life and general happiness is
impaired. And if she ever does have a problem and tries to make a claim, the
company can say that Eva never told them about her fibromyalgia or her
symptoms and problems.

Perhaps Eva’s life would be a lot easier if she just came clean and told her
boss about her problem with fibromyalgia. If she told her boss in a TV sitcom
world, he’d understand completely, everyone would pat her on the back,
unseen people would clap, and the camera would fade out. But life isn’t
always like that, and Eva knows it. So for now, Eva plans to continue to hide
her fibromyalgia and deal with its symptoms as best she can.
As Eva’s story makes clear, dealing with fibromyalgia in the workplace pre-
sents a unique set of challenges. In this chapter, I give you some guidance
about how to handle work and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). I also give you
some advice about what to do if your work burdens are so severe that you
can’t work full-time anymore and how to go about obtaining disability pay-
ments, if you need to take that step.
Explaining Fibromyalgia to Your Boss
and Co-Workers: Should You?
Telling your supervisor and co-workers why you’re taking more sick days
than anyone else and why you can’t always perform at your peak level may
seem to you (or to others giving you advice) to be the obvious choice. But
deciding whether to tell your supervisor and others at work about your
fibromyalgia can be a dilemma. Will your co-workers think that you’re an
invalid or very disabled? Will they treat you differently? Or will telling them
make your work life much better, and solve a lot of the problems that you’re
facing?
In general, the reaction of people at work probably won’t fall into the two
extreme scenarios that you may envision. Telling your boss and co-workers
about your fibromyalgia generally won’t solve all your problems. And, on the
other hand, it usually won’t create cataclysmic new problems for you, either.
Karen says that she recently told her boss about her fibromyalgia. She’s an
editor, and, sometimes, her work schedule must be sharply reduced because
of her FMS symptoms. For example, on many days, she can work no more
than five hours per day, and she says that the pain and fatigue sometimes
impair her concentration. Karen says that before she revealed her problem
with FMS to people at work, she often came under intense pressure to work
very long hours, but she just couldn’t do it. Now, her problem with fibromyal-
gia is out in the open, and Karen can limit her hours.
Karen’s boss accepts her plight, but her co-workers can’t seem to fathom
what fibromyalgia is and how it affects her — especially when they feel as
230
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

though they have to pick up the slack from the work that Karen’s unable to
do. Maybe she’s paranoid, but she feels like she’s noticed that some conver-
sations seem to stop when she walks into the room, and she’s noticed a few
resentful looks. Karen’s thinking about talking to her co-workers more about
her fibromyalgia, but she isn’t quite sure what to say.
Deciding whether to tell
Here are some questions to ask yourself in deciding whether to tell or not to
tell your boss and/or your co-workers about your fibromyalgia:
 Are your symptoms making your work quality suffer, so that people
are wondering what’s wrong? If you can still handle the job and don’t
want people to know about your FMS, you can probably keep your
secret. But if your work isn’t quite as good as it once was, it may be best
to explain why. Otherwise, people will supply their own reasons, and
you may not like the reasons that they imagine are true.
 Is the job itself worsening your symptoms? If you work on an assembly
line or have another type of job that makes your symptoms worse, you
should think about your health. You can ask for a different job, shorter
hours, or other changes when doing so for health reasons. Otherwise,
things probably won’t change.
 Are you able to work as many hours as the job requires? Sometimes,
the fatigue and pain of FMS may drag you down. You may need to request
other arrangements or even consider a different job in the company (or
out of the company).
Forming an explanation
If you decide that you want to talk about your fibromyalgia with your boss,
and maybe your co-workers as well, what’s a good explanation? I recommend
that you say that you have fibromyalgia, which is a chronic, widespread pain
problem that’s accompanied by fatigue and, sometimes, other symptoms. Tell
your boss that a doctor has diagnosed you with this illness, and you’re fre-
quently in pain, but you’ll do your best to manage your workload. But also
explain that, sometimes, the pain and fatigue may make it impossible for you
to continue working, and you’ll need breaks or may need to stop working
altogether. Initially, some people will feel uneasy around you. But when they
see you soldier on without a lot of self-pity and complaints, they may express
a newfound respect for you.
231
Chapter 17: Working with Fibromyalgia — Or Going on Disability

Deciding Whether You Should 
Stay at Your Job
When you have FMS, you may sometimes feel as though you’re trying to
press forward against a stiff wind, as you struggle to maintain a delicate bal-
ance between fulfilling your work commitments and coping with your
fibromyalgia symptoms. Some people with fibromyalgia have been able to
create an alternative work arrangement with their company to let them
telecommute. Others have switched to flex time (where you set your own
hours) or to part-time work, and that option has enabled them to continue
working in their jobs. Others, however, continue to struggle, afraid to tell
anyone at work of their medical problem.
Alternative work arrangements can be great — if they’re possible. But some
jobs simply aren’t adaptable to telecommuting, part-time work, or even flex
time. For example, if you work with others on a team, the team members usu-
ally need to be there all at once. If you work in an office that needs to be
staffed from 9 to 5, you can’t work the night shift, although you may be able
to work part-time during the day.
232
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 
Working at home works for some FMS sufferers
Carla, a programmer, says that she would’ve
had to go on disability if her company hadn’t
agreed to allow her to telecommute. She says
that she couldn’t handle the long commute any-
more. By the time she arrived at work, she had
almost nothing left, energy-wise, and getting
home after a long day was a nightmare.
Telecommuting is a great option for many indi-
viduals who find commuting, and working away
from home, to be difficult to impossible. But
don’t expect an ideal world if you work at home.
Your co-workers may be resentful, for one thing.
That’s what happened to Jennifer, who says that
she was put on salary, so that she could work at
home and rest when she needed to. Jennifer
usually puts in more than the 40 hours she used
to give the company when she worked in their
building. But she says that her co-workers 
complained that it was “favoritism,” and they
don’t seem to understand that the change was
made to benefit not only Jennifer, but also the
company. Of course, Jennifer doesn’t see her
co-workers much because she goes into the
office only briefly every week or every other
week. She’s decided that she won’t worry about
their jealousy.
Not all jobs are conducive to working at home.
However, if at least some aspect of your job can
be performed at home, as is often the case,
people with fibromyalgia say that telecommut-
ing can help a lot in keeping them continuously
employed. They do still have to complete some
amount of work within a given time, and they
need to be people who are self-motivated and
willing to push themselves when necessary.

Sometimes, the demands of the job may become impossible for a person with
fibromyalgia. For example, Julie was a potter several years ago, but she had
to quit pottery work. She explains that clay is extremely heavy, and she
became exhausted after trying to work on the clay or even center the clay on
the wheel. Often, she wouldn’t go into her studio for days from sheer exhaus-
tion. The gallery owner whom she sold her work to was angry because Julie’s
pottery was very popular, and the owner had actually wanted Julie to
increase her production. But Julie just couldn’t continue — it hurt too much.
So how do you know whether you have the kind of job that’s usually not
workable with fibromyalgia? Here are some questions to ask yourself:
 Can you take regular breaks at work, as needed?
 Can you be absent from work as needed?
 Do you need to move heavy objects or operate heavy machinery?
 Is your job especially sensitive to errors?
 Does your job require you to maintain painful body positions?
 Are others at work dependent on your being there regularly?
If you decide that you just can’t stay on at your job, you have some new deci-
sions to make. Can you work at another job in the same company? Or can
you work part-time? Maybe you’d be better off at another company. And if
your symptoms make it difficult or impossible to continue to work, you need
to consider applying for disability payments (see the “Taking the Next Step if
FMS Is Disabling” section, later in this chapter).
233
Chapter 17: Working with Fibromyalgia — Or Going on Disability
Considering the Family and Medical Leave Act
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a
federal law that directly affects workers in most
companies. This law allows workers to take up
to 12 weeks of unpaid time off each year for
medical problems that they face or to provide
care to members of their family. If you take an
FMLA leave, your company must also hold your
job open for you or give you a comparable job
when you come back to work.
Such time off can be intermittent, meaning a day
off here and there; it doesn’t have to be weeks
at a time. However, if you want to use FMLA pro-
visions, you must inform your supervisor of your
medical problem, and you should try to guessti-
mate how much time off you’ll need. For further
information on the Family and Medical Leave
Act, contact the Employment Standards
Administration of the Department of Labor at
Frances Perkins Building, 200 Constitution Ave.
NW, Washington, DC 20210 (phone: 866-487-
9243; Web: www.dol.gov/esa/whd).

Getting Your Insurance Company 
to Pay for Treatment
Most insurance companies know that fibromyalgia is a valid diagnosis and a
real medical problem. But your company may balk when you request medical
coverage for treatments that it may see as “iffy,” at best, or if you seek cover-
age for a screening test or a procedure that it doesn’t generally cover.
Because treatments or procedures that your doctor thinks you need may be
difficult for you to pay for solely out of your own pocket, taking the time to
convince the insurance company that your requests are reasonable may be
worth the extra effort. This section offers advice on achieving that goal.
Providing more info
Sometimes, the initial claim for a treatment or test goes sailing right through
your insurance claims department. But, sometimes, it gets flagged, and more
information is required. The insurance company may send you (or your
physician) a letter asking for more information. If more information is
requested, the insurance company is usually specific about what it wants.
Often, you can call the company and provide the information they need. Or
you may be able to fax the necessary information.
If you’re able to fax information to the insurance company, always send the
fax to a specific person. Most insurance companies are large and very busy,
and things easily get lost.
Understanding why your 
claim may be denied
The insurance company may deny your claim outright for an array of rea-
sons. The company may decide that the type of claim isn’t covered (such as
for massage therapy or another type of service) because it has never covered
that treatment before. Or it may decide that the provider (doctor, chiroprac-
tor, or other person) isn’t on its approved list, so it gives your claim the old
DENIED stamp. Or the company may simply make a mistake and deny a claim
that would normally be approved.
An appeal, however, will require another person at the insurance company to
consider the treatment or doctor, and if you’ve backed up your claim, often
234
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

you’ll succeed. For example, if you can show that massage therapy or some
other therapy may help, the person reviewing the appeal may give you the
thumbs-up. Maybe the doctor you want to see is the only person in the area
who’s knowledgeable about fibromyalgia, another reason to consider your
claim. Offer facts that the average person may consider reasonable, and you
have a better chance of successfully appealing the claim denial.
Appealing insurance denials: Do it!
The average person receiving a claim-denial letter from the health-insurance
company is usually disappointed and takes no further action. If you think 
that the treatment you were denied was justified, don’t make this mistake.
Virtually every health-insurance company has an appeals process, and
appealing a denied claim with the hope that whoever reviews the appeal will
reverse the decision is often well worth the effort.
The easy way
Sometimes, the mere act of calling the insurance company and explaining
that you plan to appeal the denial may cause the company to take a harder
look at your request. Sometimes, you may be asked to wait, and then you
may receive an approval that day or several days later. The reason: Few
people like to have their work reviewed, and most hate having a decision
overturned. When you appeal a denied claim, this automatically means that
someone else, often a supervisor, will review the person’s work and could
disagree with the initial decision. To avoid this possible outcome, when you
say you’re going to appeal, the denying person may change her mind about
your denial, transforming it into an approval. It doesn’t always happen, but
it’s worth a try. If your denial stands, go ahead with the appeal.
If you talk to someone from your insurance company on the phone, always
get the person’s name and take notes. Write down the date and the gist of the
conversation. Keeping this kind of a record can be very helpful later. If Jack at
the Hill Insurance Company says that no one’s ever talked to you, you can tell
Jack that you talked to Jill at the same company on May 25, and she said
whatever she said. Be confident and stand firm.
The hard way
Assuming that the verbal threat of an appeal isn’t sufficient, you’ll need to
follow through. This may involve filling out forms that the insurance com-
pany provides. Always include a cover letter that you write to go along with
any required forms. In that letter, briefly explain what you want and why you
think that you should get it.
235
Chapter 17: Working with Fibromyalgia — Or Going on Disability

In most cases, the notification that you received that denied your claim will
tell you that you have the right to appeal and will also tell you what steps to
take. If that information isn’t provided, ask the insurance company to send or
fax you the form you need, or ask your HR department to help you locate the
forms.
Don’t expect instant results when you appeal a denial. It’ll usually take weeks
and may even take months before the case is resolved. Patience and persis-
tence are key.
Adding letters
Back up your appeal with information contained in a simple typewritten letter.
Whenever possible, think of ways that the treatment you want (or the physi-
cian you want to see) would be cost-effective for the insurance company or
even save it money. You may not care about that, but the insurance company
does. For example, you may have been denied a referral to see a specialist,
such as a rheumatologist or a neurologist. Or you may have been denied an
opportunity to be evaluated with a screening tool, such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), or some other test that may help evaluate your condition. If
you believe that seeing the specialist or having the test could better pinpoint
your problem, and perhaps cut back on the number of physician visits you
incur (and especially if it could cut back on costly emergency-room visits), say
so in your letter. If you can estimate the cost savings, do so.
Keep your letter to one page, if possible. Remember: It must be typewritten,
not handwritten. If you can’t type the letter because of an arthritic condition
or another problem, get someone else to type it for you. Make sure that the
letter is dated and that it includes your address, phone number, and health-
insurance number. Provide the name of your primary-care doctor in the text
of the letter. Before sending the letter, carefully proof it to make sure that the
letter has no spelling errors or typos. Nothing hurts a person’s credibility like
a poorly written letter that’s full of errors.
Don’t insult the insurance company in your letter, no matter how annoyed
you may be. People, not computers, will read this letter, and they’ll be much
less likely to give you what you want if you call them fools, evil people, or use
other forms of name calling (even if they deserve it).
Provide factual data. Tell the company what your diagnosis is and why you
and your doctor think that you need the treatment, the test, or to see the 
specialist who’s not in your insurance company’s network of doctors. State
exactly what you want: Don’t make the reader guess. You want coverage for
an MRI or for a specific procedure or specialist. Also, explain why you want it,
even if the answer seems glaringly obvious. You want it because it can further
236
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

determine what your problem is, it may provide pain relief, or whatever the
reason. In addition, if such a treatment or referral was ever approved in the
past, for you or anyone else you know with the same health coverage, say so.
Provide as many details as possible. If the insurance company thinks that a
precedent was set, it’s more likely to give you what you want.
You may also want to ask your doctor to write a letter explaining why you
need the treatment. Ask the physician to give you the letter, so you can refer
to it in your letter. Provide the doctor’s letter as an enclosure. If the doctor
insists on sending the letter directly to the insurance company, ask for a
copy. Refer to your doctor’s letter in your letter, and enclose the copy.
If your doctor is in a clinic or office with many doctors, sometimes one
person there is responsible for pursuing insurance denials and approvals.
That person may be able to help you get approval for your claim.
Taking the Next Step if FMS Is Disabling
Perhaps you just can’t continue on in your work because you’re too sick or
because the job requires more time and is more stressful than you can cope
with — or maybe because of both reasons. If you’re in bad financial straits
and need money to support yourself, eventually you’ll have to apply for dis-
ability or take some other action to keep the dollars coming in. In that case,
you may decide that the time has come to investigate a short-term or long-
term disability leave from your job or to consider applying for disability pay-
ments received through the Social Security Administration.
A short-term disability can be an illness that prevents you from working any-
where from a few weeks to about six months, by most definitions. A long-term
disability is generally a medical problem that prevents you from working
indefinitely. However, corporate and state definitions of these terms vary.
When you have a disability, this means that a medical problem hinders or
prevents your ability to work. You may need to file for a disability program,
so that you can receive all or part of your income. You may also be too ill 
to return to work later on, and decide to apply for Social Security disability
payments.
Disability programs fall into several major categories, and they vary in terms
of how long they last, who administers these programs, whether the federal
government or your state government is involved, and in many other ways.
These categories and their many rules and ramifications are far too complex
for me to delve deeply into here. But I can offer you a brief overview of dis-
ability options.
237
Chapter 17: Working with Fibromyalgia — Or Going on Disability

Questioning yourself
Each person must make his own decision about whether to apply for a dis-
ability. In general, don’t think that your pain will automatically get better
after you’re on disability. Often, the loss of social function can have a nega-
tive impact on pain. Asking yourself the following questions as part of your
decision-making process may help:
 Have you exhausted all possible therapeutic options that were given to
you? Have you done everything you can to decrease your pain, including
taking your medications, improving your sleep, and doing your exercises?
 Has your doctor told you that you should quit working or significantly
reduce the number of hours that you work?
 Have you been taking more than four to five days off per month because
of your illness?
 Are you staying the same or getting worse?
 If you’re considering a short-term disability, will this time off enable you
an opportunity to improve your condition?
Getting disability from work
You can often get short-term and long-term disabilities from work. Not all
companies have such programs; in general, medium-size and larger corpora-
tions are more likely to offer them as part of your benefits package than
smaller companies are. If you receive a disability payment from work, you’ll

The skinny on worker’s compensation
Worker’s compensation (also known as
worker’s comp) is for individuals who can’t work
because they were injured on the job. You may
be eligible for worker’s comp if you believe 
that your job contributed to causing your
fibromyalgia — for example, if you have a job
that requires repetitive motions. People with
fibromyalgia are more likely to go with short-
term or long-term disability options rather that
worker’s compensation, but it is still an option if
you truly believe that your job caused your FMS.
This program generally provides that employees
receive about two-thirds of the amount of their
paychecks. Nearly all companies have worker’s
compensation programs. Worker’s compensa-
tion isn’t a long-term option, however.
Eventually, you must go back to work or apply
for a short-term or long-term disability benefit.

get part or all of your salary. In general, if you’re eligible for short-term dis-
ability, you’ll receive your regular paycheck amount, which will be taxed. If
you receive long-term disability, however, you’ll receive a partial amount, but
it’ll generally be nontaxable. (Check with the Internal Revenue Service [IRS]
and ask for Publication 907, “Tax Highlights for Persons with Disabilities,” for
clarification; call 800-829-3676 to have the publication mailed to you, or go to
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p907.pdf to view and print the publication
yourself.)
Don’t assume that you’d know if your company had you covered for disabil-
ity. Ask your employer or employee-benefits representative specifically about
disability coverage.
Going on Social Security
The Social Security disability program is a lifelong disability program for those
who can no longer work at all, and for whom the possibility of ever returning
to work is very slender. This federal program provides a monthly payment, as
well as Medicare, for those approved. You may qualify for a Social Security
disability if you’ve worked enough in the past and have also paid into Social
Security. In addition, other family members may also be eligible for benefits,
such as your children under age 18 or your spouse who’s caring for your
child under age 16. Whether Social Security disability income is taxable
depends on many different factors. Contact the IRS (phone: 800-829-1040;
Web: www.irs.gov) for further information.
You will need to document your disability. You know that you’re really sick,
and you’re not trying to rip off your employer. But some people are fakers,
and for this reason, proof of disability is required. You can’t prove it on your
own; instead, you need your doctors to back you up with written statements
and other information that the Social Security Administration requires.
It’s especially important that you and your doctor document the ways your
illness prevents you from functioning in your occupation — not just in a par-
ticular job. If pain prevents you from making pottery or responding appropri-
ately to split-second decisions, and those are essential acts in your
occupation (potter or police officer), write it down, tell your doctor, and
make sure that the information is clear to your disability insurer or the Social
Security Administration.
To find out more about Social Security disability benefits, contact the nearest
Social Security Administration office (look in the federal-government section
of your local phone book or call 800-772-1213) or go to www.ssa.gov/
disability.html.
239
Chapter 17: Working with Fibromyalgia — Or Going on Disability

If you’re still able to work at least part-time, and your gross earnings average
more than $900 a month in 2007 (the limit changes each year), you automati-
cally don’t qualify for a Social Security disability. To find the most recent
limit, go to www.ssa.gov/pubs/10003.html. Remember: After you start
receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits, you can’t col-
lect worker’s compensation or unemployment benefits.
According to the Social Security Administration, to apply for a disability, you
need to provide the following information:
 A phone number where you can be reached as well as contact informa-
tion for a friend or relative
 A list of all illnesses, injuries, and conditions that make you unable to
work as well as the date when you became unable to work
 Names, addresses, and phone numbers for all physicians, hospitals, and
clinics and the dates when you were seen (whether or not they were
consulted for fibromyalgia)
 A list of all prescription and nonprescription drugs that you take
 A list of all the jobs you’ve had for the last 15 years, with a description of
the job you were in for the longest period
 A list of all the education and training you’ve received to date
 Your complete medical records (The Social Security Administration will
request this from your doctor, or you can provide it to them.)
 Your most recent Form W-2, or, if you’re self-employed, your most recent
tax return
 Information about family members applying for benefits, such as your
minor children (Their Social Security numbers and proof of birth dates
are needed.)
Don’t expect immediate action on your claim: A year or even longer may pass
before any action is taken, and even then, no matter how strongly docu-
mented your application is, or how ill you are, you may be denied. The whole
process has several layers of application/appeal, and experts say that it’s
very important to not give up too early. Instead, appeal to the reconsideration
level, the next rung up the appeals process. When your claim is reconsidered,
you may still be denied at this level — attorneys say that many people are. If
you’re denied again, don’t be discouraged; just keep going. The next level up
is when an administrative-law judge hears your case, and experts report that
this point is where many people’s claims prevail.
Of course, seeing the judge doesn’t guarantee anything, and I can’t promise
you that you’ll ultimately be granted a disability payment. But if you’re
denied at the application point and don’t appeal, you’ll never know what
would have happened if you’d kept going. So stay the course.
240
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

The burden of proof
Because fibromyalgia isn’t a listed impairment specifically defined by the
Code of Federal Regulations, if your claim is denied at a lower level and you
appeal the denial, the administrative-law judge must determine whether your
condition meets or exceeds those conditions already listed, in terms of caus-
ing the same degree of functional limitations of a listed impairment.
The Code of Federal Regulations is a publication of permanent government
regulations by agencies of the federal government, published in the Federal
Register by the Office of the Federal Register of the National Archives and
Records Administration.
Under current law, the judge must give claimants increased credibility in
assessing their own functional capacity. By properly documenting your claim,
you stand an excellent chance for success, although the entire process may
take as long as two years from start to finish.
Giving your doctors a heads-up is a good idea. Contact them by phone or by
letters to let them know ahead of time that you’re applying for Social Security
disability, so they won’t be completely surprised when they’re contacted by
Social Security Administration officials asking for information about your
medical status.
If you apply for a Social Security work disability and also file for worker’s
compensation or unemployment benefits while your claim is pending, this
action may be considered by the administrative-law judge as proof that,
except for the work injury or unemployment, you remain fully employable.
This may mean that you won’t be approved for the disability.
According to Alec G. Sohmer, an attorney who assists individuals nationwide
who have fibromyalgia and other medical conditions with obtaining disability
benefits, the disability standard for adults is an inability to engage in any sub-
stantial gainful activity because of a medically determinable physical and/or
mental impairment expected to last at least 12 months.
Finding an Attorney to Help You
Navigating the sometimes tortuous path of applying for a disability from the
Social Security Administration is generally not for the inexperienced or faint-
hearted. Many people tell me that they needed the services of an experi-
enced lawyer to guide them through the numerous dangers and pitfalls on
the rocky way to approval of their disability claim.
241
Chapter 17: Working with Fibromyalgia — Or Going on Disability

Make sure that any attorney you think about consulting with is also an attor-
ney experienced with disability claims: Don’t hire someone who wants to
learn on your time. Local support groups may be able to recommend talented
attorneys who can assist you with your disability claim. You can also ask
your physician if he can recommend a disability attorney who’s experienced
in helping people who seek approval for Social Security disabilities.
Keep in mind that the attorney should be willing to work on contingency,
meaning that she’ll receive a percentage of the lump sum you’ll receive if
you’re approved (backdated to an earlier date, to be determined by the
Social Security Administration). This means that, if you’re approved, you’ll
receive a lump sum payment dated back to approximately when you first
applied. Of course, your attorney, if you’ve hired one, will receive a chunk of
that “change.”
If you decide to seek an attorney to help with your Social Security disability
claim, make sure that the lawyer is a member of the National Organization 
of Social Security Claimants Representatives (NOSSCR). Contact NOSSCR at
560 Sylvan Ave., Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632 (phone: 800-431-2804; Web: www.
nosscr.org), to find members in your area.
When you’ve found an attorney who appears to be experienced and knowl-
edgeable about disability claims, you should still ask him a few screening
questions before signing up. Here are some questions that you may consider
asking your candidate:
 About how many people have you assisted with applications for Social
Security disability claims? The lawyer should’ve assisted at least 20 to
30 people.
 Of these, about what percent were approved by the Social Security
Administration? The percent should be over 50 percent of cases.
 About how many people with fibromyalgia have you assisted?
Because the numbers may not be high, don’t count out the attorney if
the answer is “zero.” But award that attorney bonus points if he does
have experience with helping people with FMS.

because they just never know what to expect from her on any given day.
Will she have enough energy and a low enough pain level to go to the movies
or on a picnic with them today? Or to attend the school play that her daugh-
ter has an important role in? Or is this going to be yet another really bad day,
when it’s better to leave Liza alone in her misery? Her family doesn’t know —
but then, neither does Liza herself.
Gail says that on some days, she can tackle tough problems at work and then
go home and cook dinner that evening. Afterward, on those good days, Gail’s
able to help her children with their homework. However, on other days, Gail
can barely raise her head from her pillow because the pain is too intense. Her
children told her that they see her as two different people: Healthy Mom and
Sick Mom. They don’t seem to like Sick Mom very much, although they strug-
gle to be fair.
This chapter is about understanding and dealing with the effects of your
fibromyalgia on the people you live with and others you care about. Of
course, if the other person has fibromyalgia, as some of your family or
friends may, that person may be able to understand and identify with your
problems very well. However, most people you care about probably don’t
have fibromyalgia, and they can only know what fibromyalgia is like based on
what you tell them.

244
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 
In this chapter, I help you understand how to explain your problems with
fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) to others you care about, whether they’re your
children, your partner, or other important people in your life. I also talk about
expressing your needs to others and helping them understand how your
fibromyalgia affects you. In addition, it’s important for you to listen to your
loved ones and hear how your fibromyalgia affects them. You may be able to
make simple changes that can satisfy everyone. At the very least, you’ll clear
the air.
Understanding How Fibromyalgia 
Can Affect Your Relationships
Most people can grasp the basic symptoms of fibromyalgia, and they can also
understand how fibromyalgia affects you, individually, in your daily life. Of
course, people aren’t solely rational beings; they have emotions, too. As a
result, even if and when they fully grasp your problem logically, they may still
have an emotional element to their thoughts about FMS that includes feelings
of anger, resentment, sadness, confusion, and so on.
These emotions are normal in everyday interactions with family members
who have problems. Even if people don’t like these feelings or they want to
deny that they exist, the emotions are still there anyway. As a result, friends
and loved ones who sometimes react negatively to the effects of your
fibromyalgia on them aren’t necessarily bad or stupid or mean — instead,
they’re just human. But you can help them to cope with your fibromyalgia
better.
Here are some ways that your fibromyalgia may interfere with otherwise usu-
ally good interactions between you and your friends and family members:
 You may not listen to what they say (or even hear it at all) because lis-
tening is hard when you’re in extreme pain. They may think that
you’re not listening because you’re bored or because you don’t care. Tell
them that you’re having pain, and you simply can’t listen well (or at all)
now. When you’re feeling better — and yes, at some point, you will feel
better — you’ll be happy to listen to what they have to say.
 You may be more prone to saying “no” to doing fun things or manag-
ing responsibilities when your fibromyalgia symptoms are bothering
you a lot. But you’d probably say “yes” if you were feeling better. Explain
your reasons for saying “no” to the people you care about, and also
explain that you want to say “yes” and you would say “yes” if you were
feeling better.

 You may tend to agree to anything your family members ask for, if
agreeing will make them go away and leave you alone when you’re
feeling bad. (For example, you agree to requests you’d normally say
“no” to, such as a sleepover your daughter has asked to go to at the
home of a friend whom you’ve never met and know nothing about.) Or
maybe, while in major pain, you’d agree if your 10-year-old son asked for
permission to take the next space shuttle to Mars. Hey, why not! It’d be
good for him, broaden his horizons. Fight this natural impulse to make
things easy on yourself now. The long-term effects can be much worse!
Avoid making decisions when you’re feeling bad. If you must decide now,
think about how you’ve decided similar issues in the past.
Be honest with yourself and your family. Accidentally slipping into using your
fibromyalgia to get out of obligations that you don’t enjoy can be very easy to
do. But if you turn down an activity and then find energy to do other things
that you like, your family will notice, and you’ll undermine their sympathy. If
you say “no” to going to the fast-food restaurant with your family but on the
same day, say “yes” to a friend who wants to eat lunch at a new gourmet
place, that’s an oops! Don’t make that mistake.
Moving Yourself to a Better 
Frame of Mind
When people have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia, they often hold
one of two extreme and opposite thoughts, and either way, they perceive
themselves as a victim and a person unlikely to move forward:
 At one extreme, some people believe that no one in the world can
ever possibly understand or appreciate what they’re going through.
Trying to explain the problem to other people just isn’t even worth the
trouble because they can never understand.
 The other extreme view that people have is that everyone should
understand the problem and somehow know exactly how tough it is for
them. People who adopt this viewpoint may become angry and resentful
when others aren’t as sympathetic as they supposedly should be.
Both extremes are unreasonable positions to take. For example, although
people who don’t have fibromyalgia really can’t “feel your pain,” they may
have arthritis or another chronic-pain problem and, thus, can understand
what chronic pain feels like, even if it’s not your specific type of chronic pain.
On some level, they should be able to grasp your problem. On the other hand,
people shouldn’t be expected to automatically sympathize with poor you —
even when those people are your own loving family members. You’re setting
yourself up for disappointment if you take either of these polar positions.
245
Chapter 18: Helping Loved Ones Deal with Your Fibromyalgia

To avoid adopting one of these two extremes, think about how you generally
regard other people in relation to your fibromyalgia. As people who are hope-
less and who could never understand? Or do you lean more toward regarding
them as hopeless people who should understand? Try to move toward the
middle. Most people are trainable and can be educated on what fibromyalgia
is in general and how it affects you specifically, as well as what you need
them to do.
Opening Up for Some Honest Dialogue
Because fibromyalgia can often have an intense emotional impact on your
family members and friends, you need to discuss with them not only the
basic facts about what fibromyalgia is but also how it makes you feel. For
example, having FMS may make you feel useless, angry, upset, and so forth.
You also need to give the people whom you care about a chance to tell you
how your fibromyalgia and its effects make them feel. They may tell you that
they get frustrated, upset, and confused and that they experience a wide vari-
ety of other emotions as well.
Talking about feelings doesn’t mean that the time’s come to assess guilt or
blame. This isn’t Judge Judy, and no one’s on trial. In fact, it’s best if you tell
your family and friends that your illness is not their fault. Sure, they should
already know that anyway, but sometimes, they need to hear it from you
directly. In addition, you should also tell the people you care about that the
symptoms of your fibromyalgia aren’t your fault, either. (You may need to
remind yourself of this fact periodically, too.)
The key purpose of discussing your feelings about your illness — and listen-
ing to how your friends and family feel about your illness — is to understand
and accommodate each other in the best way for all of you.
One way to uncover issues and problems so you can start working on them is
to call a family meeting. You’ll probably need more than one meeting; maybe
one or two a week until family members seem to feel generally comfortable
with the way things are. The meeting should include your partner, your chil-
dren, and anyone else who lives with you. They may be reluctant or suspi-
cious about this idea but insist on their attendance.
A family meeting, as with any meeting, should have at least a general topic. If
you want to get people’s feelings out in the open about your fibromyalgia,
246
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

then tell them that’s the subject you’re going to discuss. Prepare yourself
ahead of time to hear some negative comments — as well as some touchingly
supportive ones.
The first time you have a family meeting, set some ground rules. Everyone is
allowed to talk, even your 3-year-old. But no one is allowed to give a speech.
Everyone should be polite, no insulting or mean remarks are allowed, and no
cursing is allowed. (A lot of information can be communicated without sar-
casm, profanity, and so forth.) No one’s allowed to interrupt. Everyone can
speak, but everyone needs to give others a chance to talk. This rule will need
to be repeated several times at first. After a while, don’t be surprised when
you’re admonished by your 8-year-old child if you interrupt or speechify!
Accept the criticism in good grace.
Expect some hesitation when you start because, after all, people in your
family may have bottled up or censored their feelings for a long time. You can
start by asking each person, in a going-around-the-circle fashion, to tell you
what bothers him the most about your being sick. You can also ask each
person what is the most important thing that she would like you to do when
you’re feeling well. You may be very surprised at the responses you get.
For example, the holidays may be coming up, and maybe you don’t feel like
going through the big ordeal of completely cleaning and decorating the house
and preparing a big meal for all the relatives to come over and rapidly
devour. But you don’t want to spoil the holidays for your family. If you bring
up your concern, you may find, to your surprise, that other family members
say that they’d really prefer a holiday celebration for “just us.” You could also
ask everyone what one thing they most would like to do over the holidays —
it may be something easy, like driving around and looking at house decora-
tions or going to a religious service. Remember: Satisfying your family doesn’t
always have to be hard.
Don’t expect every family meeting to reveal amazing or even useful informa-
tion. Sometimes, they won’t. Also, sometimes, important dialogue may occur
after the meeting when members interact with each other about how they
never knew that the other one felt this way.
Avoid trying to talk about your illness or resolve difficult communication
problems with your friends and family during those times when you feel
really bad. Tell others that you’re sick now, but you’ll talk to them later about
these issues. And make sure you do talk to them later, as soon as you can.
247
Chapter 18: Helping Loved Ones Deal with Your Fibromyalgia

Anticipating Difficulties
Sometimes, your children, partner, and others may react negatively or even
very negatively to the effects of your fibromyalgia. They may also react nega-
tively when you can’t participate in various fun or work activities because
you feel bad.
Some of the negative responses that people you love may exhibit are
 Anger: Perhaps family members are mad at you, but more likely, they’re
angry at your condition because you can’t do the things they want or
need from you, such as things you used to be able to do.
 Annoyance: This response is a milder form of anger. It may occur because
you can’t go places or do things that family members want you to.
 Frustration: Family members get frustrated because they have to
accomplish many tasks that you used to do, and they wonder when or if
this problem is ever going to end.
 Fear: The thought that things may get even worse drives fear. Will you
become even more dependent on family members in the future? Will you
ever get any better, or will you only get worse?
 Guilt: Your family members may feel as though they should be helping
you out more, but for their own reasons, they aren’t. Sometimes guilt is a
motivator to do better; other times it holds people back. Talking about it
can help.
 Resentment or suspicion: Maybe you don’t have to wash the dishes, do
the laundry, clean the cat litter, or do other boring or yucky jobs that are
part of every household. Your friends and family can’t see the pain, and
may begin to wonder if it’s really there.
You know how bad you feel, and you probably also know that your family
members are frustrated and upset that you can’t do activities with them that
may have been easy for you to do in the past. You can’t help being sick, and
it’s not your fault. But your partner and your children may find it hard to
cope with the effects of your illness, especially if they don’t understand why
you’re in pain. It’s important for you to understand and accept this fact.
Knowing How to Respond 
to “Helpful” Comments
Denise says that she’s tried to explain to her friends how her fibromyalgia
makes her feel, but they often respond by telling her that she should eat a
healthier diet or get herself into better physical shape. One friend said, “Oh,
248
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

fibromyalgia. That’s what doctors say when they want to tell you that you
have something, but they don’t know what it is.” Denise says that these kinds
of comments really hurt her. It makes her feel like people think her doctor is
incompetent or that she’s a hypochondriac imagining her condition.
So, what do you do when people say such things? You have two primary
choices. You can say nothing and let it bother you. Or you can say something,
preferably something that won’t antagonize people but will clear the air.
Table 18-1 has some suggestions for how to respond to comments that you’d
rather not have heard.

Helping Your Significant Other Cope
Fibromyalgia is very tough on you, but it’s usually no day at the beach for
your partner, either. Often, you can’t do your share of the housework, and
you may not be able to work full-time, part-time, or at all. If you have chil-
dren, your partner may have to take them places and resolve their petty
squabbles at home — as well as participate in the fun stuff, such as watch
your child win a prize or make a touchdown, without you there because
you’re too sick.
Fibromyalgia can also put a major crimp in your sex life. Who wants to make
mad, passionate love when your body feels like you contracted the flu — right
249
Chapter 18: Helping Loved Ones Deal with Your Fibromyalgia

after you were run over by a truck? Probably not you. On the other hand,
your partner probably still does feel like having sex sometimes. In addition,
your partner needs some personal attention. He needs you to listen when he
needs to discuss work and family problems, as well as fears, goals, and aspi-
rations. But listening and interacting can be hard to do when your brain
seems to be stuffed with cotton balls and you feel like the village idiot. (If
you’re really feeling out of it, tell your partner that you’ll talk later. And then
do it, as soon as possible.)
The key is to share your feelings, without blaming your partner or yourself
for your medical problems, and to also listen to how your partner feels, with-
out taking offense at what she says or feeling as though you must defend
yourself. Using that tactic, Colleen says that her husband Tom told her one
day that he felt very sad and left out because she saved up all her “smiley-
face time” for everyone else but him.
Colleen thought a lot about what Tom said, and she realized that he was right.
She’d been expending all her energy on their children or her co-workers and
job. By the time her husband came home at night, Colleen was nearly always
collapsed on the sofa, virtually incapable of any communication and basically
only good for staring blankly at the television set.
Colleen decided to cut out some activities. For example, she arranged for
other parents to drive her daughter to soccer practice and her son to Cub
Scouts. At work, when asked to collect money for charity, she said that she
couldn’t do it this year. Colleen also cut back on her work hours, deciding
that her own health and her relationship with Tom were more important than
trying to be a fast-track worker. Colleen also learned to say, “No, I can’t do
that.” She discovered that, in most cases, she didn’t need to apologize or give
47 reasons why she couldn’t do something. She just had to politely refuse —
that was enough. This was an amazing revelation to her.
Another change: Colleen resolved to not try so hard to hide her fatigue and
pain from others. Like many other people with fibromyalgia, she hadn’t ever
mentioned her problem to others, so they’d assumed that she could carry a
full load. Hiding her pain and fatigue had been exhausting. Now she stopped
hiding it, and they could see how she felt. After they found out about
Colleen’s fibromyalgia, the demanding expectations of her co-workers
decreased. With these changes, Colleen managed to hold on to some energy
for Tom when he came home at night. Things were a lot better between them
after that.
And what about sex? As with many people with fibromyalgia, Colleen’s sex
drive was usually slim to none, although she hoped that her reduced sched-
ule might eventually change that. She also decided that she didn’t have to
feel 100 percent like having sex to participate in it with Tom. After all, if she
waited for intense passion to overwhelm her, they might never have sex.
Colleen talked to Tom frankly about sex and her problems with fibromyalgia.
250
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

She asked Tom to be very gentle and take it slowly when they had sex, and he
agreed. She was surprised to find out that, sometimes, even though she’d
been feeling pretty blah about sex, her interest was aroused after they
started. Of course, when Colleen’s symptoms were really bad, sex just wasn’t
going to happen. And Tom understood and accepted that fact.
Explaining Fibromyalgia to Your Kids
Debbie says that she wishes she could just be a normal mother — she’d like
to go outside and play basketball with her children, for example. She feels
that she’s deprived her children of a lot of their childhood because they’ve
had to take on extra chores that she just can’t handle. She’s also not so sure
that they really understand why she feels so bad much of the time.
Sometimes, you have trouble understanding fibromyalgia yourself. You may
feel terrible on some days, okay on others, and, once in a while, almost
normal. It doesn’t seem to make sense. So how can you explain this seem-
ingly nonsensical problem to your children? It’s doable! Read on.
If you lose your temper, largely because your symptoms of fibromyalgia are
making you feel so bad, and you blurt out mean words to your child, just
apologize. Don’t wallow in guilt, don’t castigate yourself out loud as the worst
parent on the planet, and don’t spend a lot of time explaining or trying to
excuse your behavior. Just say you’re sorry. That’s usually enough.
Keep it simple
Most children, including adolescents, don’t need a lot of complicated and
theoretical explanations about the causes of fibromyalgia, symptoms that
people with FMS experience, and so forth. They don’t need charts or dia-
grams, and you shouldn’t expect them to read books on fibromyalgia, either.
(If they want to read something about FMS, this book is a good start.)
Your children need to know that your fibromyalgia is a chronic medical con-
dition, and they also need to know how it affects you personally, what your
specific symptoms are, and what they can do (or shouldn’t do) to help you
cope with your illness.
For example, if loud music really bothers you when you’re sick, tell that to
your children. They can use headphones, or they can turn the music down.
And don’t forget to ask your children how you can help them cope with your
illness. For example, would they prefer to spend time at a friend’s house
when you’re feeling your worst, or can they think of other solutions that
might work for you both?

Chapter 18: Helping Loved Ones Deal with Your Fibromyalgia

Stress that it’s chronic
Explaining the chronic part of your illness is very important because most
children, and even many adolescents, consider medical problems as here
today, gone tomorrow. A leg is broken, it’s set in a cast, it heals, and then it’s
fine. A person gets a cold, suffers from sneezing, coughing, and wheezing, and
then gets well. Unless a child suffers from a chronic medical problem herself,
most children perceive illness as something that improves and then goes
away. The fact that some illnesses do not go away, but instead, require contin-
ued treatment, can be a difficult concept for many children.
Part of the difficulty for children in understanding a chronic illness is their
own time frame of reference, which is now and, perhaps, later. (And later
means this afternoon or tomorrow. It usually doesn’t mean weeks or months
from now, and it almost never means years from now.) This different time
frame of reference doesn’t mean that they can’t understand — it just means
that explaining a chronic illness may take more effort.
Clarify that they didn’t make you sick
Be sure to tell your children, if they’re still young, that your fibromyalgia isn’t
their fault. Children frequently have magical thinking, which means that they
think that if they have “bad” thoughts, bad consequences can happen to
other people. For example, your small child may think that you’re sick
because she was mad at you one day and wished to herself that you’d be
punished. Tell your children that having angry thoughts is normal, even
though it doesn’t seem so nice. But having those bad thoughts can’t make
other people sick because thoughts can’t do that.
Another concern is that your children may think that your illness is fatal.
They won’t necessarily tell you that they’re worried you could have cancer or
another illness that can kill you. Joanie, whose mom has fibromyalgia, devel-
oped a fear of going home after school. She’d begun to fear that one day,
she’d come home and find her mother dead on the couch. After all, Mom was
so sick all the time. Maybe she had cancer like her friend’s mom who had
died. When Teresa, her mother, realized what was going on, she reassured
Joanie: Yes, she was sick. But no, she didn’t have a terminal illness.
Anticipate questions
It’s understandable and normal if your children have many questions about
your fibromyalgia. When you open the topic to questions, you may be sur-
prised at the floodgate that’s released. Sometimes, questions will come right
away. Other questions may come tomorrow or a week from now.
252
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

Your children may ask how long you’re going to have this condition (you
don’t know) and when you’re going to get better (you’re working on it, but
again, you don’t know the answer to this question, as much as you’d like to),
as well as many other questions.
Your children may ask you if they’re going to get fibromyalgia, too. Although
fibromyalgia isn’t a contagious disease, certain studies indicate that FMS
runs in families. However, the only way to know if someone has fibromyalgia
is for that person to see a doctor.
Vary your approach with the age of your child. For example, if the child is up
to about 8 or 9 years of age, you may want to use the analogy of a glass,
giving a concrete example of you when you’re “spilling over” with pain and
tiredness. Fill the glass up in the sink and let it spill over. The glass repre-
sents you on a bad day. Then, fill it up short of the brim. This is you when
you have some extra energy to give your family. Older children won’t need to
see a demo: You can explain the spilling-over concept in words. On one of
your bad days, you can tell your children, “It’s a spilling-over day for me
today. Sorry!”
Joining a Support Group
Support groups can provide you with valuable information, moral support,
and a feeling that you aren’t alone. At the same time, some support groups
can be constraining. And sometimes, people who attend support groups say
that some people in those groups complain nonstop and offer no solutions to
their problems.
Don’t go by what others, including your best friends, think about particular
support groups. Instead, find out for yourself. Take a “test drive” of a support
group before joining up by attending a meeting, observing what happens, and
seeing whether you think that you’d feel comfortable as a member. You may
also find considerable help with an online group, where you don’t have to
find babysitters, go out in the rain or blizzard, and so forth.
Some areas have support groups with meetings that are moderated by profes-
sionals, such as psychologists and social workers. These groups generally
cost money, but the presence of a skilled leader can enhance the effectiveness
of the group and decrease the experience that people are “just complaining.” If
you can’t find a good, free support group, consider trying a professionally
moderated group (if you can find one nearby). Your insurance company may
even cover the cost. Ask your doctor if she knows of such a group.

Chapter 18: Helping Loved Ones Deal with Your Fibromyalgia

Looking at the pros and 
cons of support groups
Nearly every type of support group, no matter what type of members the
group is supporting, has both pros and cons.
If you’re eager to hear the latest opinions on fibromyalgia treatment, from a
layperson’s point of view, people in support groups often are among the first
to know what’s hot, what’s worked for them, and what failed miserably. They
may also be knowledgeable about the most recent studies, journal articles,
medications, alternative remedies, and any other info you’d like to know
about FMS.
But support groups aren’t for everyone. On the downside, support-group mem-
bers may have little or no medical expertise, and they may be unable to screen
out the scams from the bona fide treatments for fibromyalgia. So always take
the advice of nonphysicians with a grain — or maybe a pound — of salt.
Lydia says that she went to a local support group for people with fibromyal-
gia several times, but she always felt much worse afterward. Carmen says
that the members of her support group were all so physically ill, miserable,
and hopeless that she couldn’t stand to be in the room with them. She much
prefers an online support group, where she can exchange ideas with others
who are also sick but really trying to get better. Deanna says that she gained
a great deal from her support-group meeting: When she heard about a great
doctor who treated FMS, she called him for an appointment, was treated, and
now feels much better.
Deciding whether to take others 
with you to meetings
If you find a good local support group where you feel comfortable discussing
your FMS symptoms and where other members offer helpful suggestions on
how to feel better, this group is one to treasure. Because you like it so much,
you may think that taking your children, your spouse, or others to a meeting
would be a great idea. By going, they could understand what fibromyalgia is
all about. Taking people who don’t have fibromyalgia with you to a support
group has pros and cons. I cover a few major ones here.
254
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

The key advantage of taking a person who does not have fibromyalgia along
with you to a support group is that your partner or family member can see
with his own eyes that many other people have the same kinds of symptoms
and problems that you have. You’re not an anomaly. In fact, you may be a lot
better off than some of the other members, in terms of energy levels and how
you’re coping. If so, your loved one can gain a whole new view of how
fibromyalgia can impact a person’s life (and how lucky you both are).
You may also be worse off than other members, and that can be useful infor-
mation to your family member or partner as well. She may not have realized
how difficult your symptoms were and how hard you’ve been struggling to
cope with your illness.
Taking your partner or loved one with you to a support-group meeting also
has some disadvantages. He may be uncomfortable and unhappy and may
also become upset about viewing the misery and pain of so many people.
Some individuals who do have fibromyalgia say that seeing the pain of others
has distressed them greatly, so it’s fair to say that a person who doesn’t have
fibromyalgia may also become very upset.
If a meeting (or most meetings) becomes a gripe session about how awful the
family members, spouses, and partners are, your loved one will likely find the
discussion to be very distressing, especially if that loved one is doing the best
that she can to be supportive and helpful. Being perceived as the “enemy,”
when you know you’re really trying to help, can be very hard to handle.
Children and teenagers may become upset and distressed about the frank
discussions that occur in support groups. And they really don’t need to hear
individuals talk about their sex lives (or lack thereof).
Before you even consider bringing your partner, your child, your teenager, or
anyone else whom you love to your support group, attend a few meetings. Make
sure that it’s a visitor-friendly, or at least a visitor-neutral, environment and one
your loved one may gain insight from. He won’t benefit from a mentality that
sees people without FMS as the bad guys. But he may gain from an environment
where people are open to sharing information in a positive manner.

Getting e-support
Online support groups can take two forms: list-
servs (Internet special-interest organizations in
which you receive all messages by e-mail) or
newsgroups, which are areas on the Internet
where people can read and leave public 
messages.
Alt.med fibromyalgia is a popular
online newsgroup. One way to access news-
groups is to go to http://groups.
google.com and then type in the name of the
group. You could also type in fibromyalgia to
find an array of groups. Reading messages on
newsgroups doesn’t cost extra, nor do you pay
membership fees. Your only expense will be
what it costs to use the Internet.
Another possibility is Fibromyalgia Community,
which has a listserv. To find out about this
group, go to www.fmscommunity.org and
click on the listserv information link.
The key advantage to these groups is the
wealth of information they provide, as well as
discussions about feelings and issues related to
fibromyalgia. In addition, participants frequently
provide Web links that you can click on to move
to interesting Web sites or to journal or news-
paper articles.
Keep in mind that anyone who uses the Internet,
anywhere on the globe, will be able to read your
postings, so don’t post anything that you wouldn’t
want a complete stranger (or your gossipy
neighbor down the street) to read. It’s also
important to realize that some people who post
messages online are trying to promote a partic-
ular product that they may have a financial
interest in. So keep your thinking hat on and
your skeptical brain in gear.
Internet groups that discuss fibromyalgia and
provide information can be treasure troves. But
keep in mind that they’re nearly always domi-
nated by people who aren’t physicians and who
have no medical training. Reading the postings,
as well as asking questions and getting
responses, can be educational and helpful. But
don’t take medical advice from people who
aren’t physicians. Always consult your doctor
before starting or ending any over-the-counter
or prescribed medications.

C
arly doesn’t have fibromyalgia, but her best friend, Shannon, has been
diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). So many times, Carly has
wanted to sympathize with Shannon and with the pain, fatigue, and other
symptoms that she’s obviously going through. But Carly is often afraid to say
something because she may say the wrong thing. Is Carly right to be so wor-
ried about being politically correct around Shannon — so much so that she’s
basically tongue-tied, even when Shannon is clearly hurting?
The answer is no. And yet, it’s also yes. No because feeling like you’re avoiding
a topic that looms so large in the life of your friend or loved one isn’t good.
But yes, with regard to holding back comments, because many times, people
blurt out comments that they think sound kind or helpful, but that aren’t taken
that way. For example, saying, “I know just how you feel,” when you don’t have
a clue how the person feels, can be upsetting to a person with fibromyalgia.
In this chapter, I talk about how you can understand how friends, family, and
others feel when they have fibromyalgia, without actually having fibromyalgia
yourself, and what you can do to help them. I also talk about expressing
gentle affection for the pain that your loved one is going through. But don’t
worry! You don’t need to adopt a permanent hands-off policy. I explain how
to handle the touching/nontouching aspect of your relationship.
I also cover your feelings in this chapter, and discuss whether you should tag
along to an FMS support-group meeting or check out online groups devoted
to FMS. Going to such an actual or virtual meeting when you don’t have FMS
yourself has pros and cons that I describe.

Understanding without 
Feeling Their Pain
If you don’t have fibromyalgia yourself, you really don’t want to “feel the
pain” of someone else who does have it. The fact that your friend or family
member must put up with it is bad enough. However, when you don’t have
FMS, you can’t fully understand what she’s going through. Instead, you must
rely upon your observations of her behavior, what she tells you, and what
you can find out about fibromyalgia. (Reading this book is a very good start!)
Knowing what to say, what not to say, and when to say nothing at all can be a
challenge. Should you express concern for how bad your loved one feels or
show sympathy with a smile? I can’t provide one right answer for every situa-
tion, but the following section offers ideas that may help.
Empathizing without saying that you know
how FMS feels (because you don’t)
How can you be truly sympathetic when you can’t really experience how
your friend or loved one feels? You can talk openly with your friend about his
FMS, asking questions, making supportive comments, and listening atten-
tively. Try to understand what he’s going through as best you can. Attempt to
relate his problem with difficulties you’ve had — problems that other people
didn’t understand or relate to.
You’ll never say the perfect thing at all times — no one does. But you can try
to avoid saying annoying things and work on making supportive statements.
Here are a few examples of what you can say to help a person you care about
who does have FMS. (Use your own wording.) These simple comments may
help or, at least, may start a dialogue between you and your loved one. (See
the “Helpful/nonhelpful statements to make to someone with FMS” sidebar,
later in this chapter, for more helpful statements.)
 Fibromyalgia sounds really difficult to deal with.
 How can I help?
 I’m sorry that you have this problem.
 It must be hard to look normal but feel really bad on the inside.
258
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

After your friend responds, summarize what he’s said to you. Doing so shows
that you’ve been listening. When you summarize what you think that your
friend has said, even if you get it wrong, at least the person can tell that
you’re making a sincere effort to understand. For example, you may say, “It
sounds like you’re having a really hard time right now.” He may agree and try
to explain his problem, or may nod in relief that someone cares.
Knowing what not to say
Avoid making comments that deny or diminish the pain of the person with
FMS, such as “It can’t be that bad!” or “Tomorrow will be a better day.” She
feels really bad right now and doesn’t need to hear unsupportive and hurtful
comments. Read on for more information on what not to say.
For starters, do not say that God or fate or karma gives problems only to
people who can handle them. Even if you think it’s true, consider how nega-
tive such a comment may sound to other people. It sounds like you’re saying,
“If you’re strong, you deserve to be punished for being strong.”
Also, when talking with your loved one who has fibromyalgia, don’t fall into
an unconscious one-upmanship, such as “I know someone sicker than you
are.” You may think you’d never do this, but it’s so easy to do! For example, if
your friend talks about his pain and fatigue, don’t say that, yes, that’s pretty
bad, but your sister’s cousin’s husband really has a severe problem, because
blah, blah, blah. Think how you’d feel if someone did this to you. If you start
to say something that fills this bill, then stop!
To better relate to your family member or friend who has fibromyalgia,
remember how you’ve felt when friends or others have glossed over a dis-
tressing illness or disturbing problem that you had. Maybe other people told
you to cheer up and get over it or that it was really no big deal. Maybe you
felt like you didn’t have permission to feel the emotions you were experienc-
ing. Recall the emotions you felt when your pain was denigrated. And work
on not diminishing the feelings of your loved one with fibromyalgia.
Leaving them alone: Sometimes, 
solitude helps
Sometimes, having company is great. And other times, it’s not so great, like
when you feel sick, cranky, overtired, and so forth. Normally, your loved one
would love to spend time with you. But when her FMS symptoms flare up,
sometimes company is just too much to bear.
259
Chapter 19: Helping Someone You Care About Who’s Hurting

Lorna has fibromyalgia, and she wishes people would understand that she
doesn’t want them to try to “fix” her (she already knows that they can’t).
Instead, she wishes they’d just leave her alone when she has a flare-up of her
FMS symptoms. Lorna says she does so much better by going into “hiberna-
tion” for the few days when her symptoms are really acting up. Afterward,
she emerges, much more congenial with her family and friends.
So how do you know when to steer clear of your friend or family member
who has fibromyalgia? Usually, it’s not that hard to tell, when you know some-
body. But here are some indicators:
 Your friend doesn’t make eye contact. He could be angry or upset with
you — or he could be exhausted or in pain.
 Your loved one has a slumped-over posture and a dejected appear-
ance. You think she may be depressed, but she says that she’s “just
tired” — and she may really mean it.
 Your family member is responding in one-word answers and doesn’t
seem to be “here.” He may want to be alone.
 Your loved one asks you the same questions repeatedly. She may be
deep in a fibro fog (a temporary lack of concentration — a symptom of
FMS) and may need some downtime alone at home.
When hugging hurts
What’s the normal and natural response when you’re feeling sad for someone
you care about who’s in pain? For many people, their first reaction is to reach
out and hug the hurting person.
Force yourself to resist the impulse to hug a person in the throes of a
fibromyalgia flare-up. Even a little hug can feel like the grip of a grizzly bear to
a person in pain from fibromyalgia. Always ask a person with fibromyalgia
first if it’s okay to give a hug. And if it is okay, keep it gentle. No bear hugs
allowed, unless the person says that he wants one.
Just because you can’t offer a person you really care about a big, enthusiastic
hug doesn’t mean that it’s hands-off forever. Instead, when your loved one is
really hurting, a gentle butterfly-like touch to the shoulder or (preferably) the
hand can be seen and appreciated as the warm and affectionate gesture that
you mean it to be. When your friend or loved one feels well enough, she will
usually welcome a gentle hug — but ask for permission first!
260
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

You can communicate positive emotion and support with other types of body
language, such as:
 Looking directly at the person as he speaks: Most people don’t look at
each other because they’re actually thinking of something else, like what
they’re going to eat for lunch. Try to really pay attention to what your
loved one is saying. People feel like you’re paying attention and you care
about what they’re saying when you actually look at them.
 Smiling sympathetically, without making any comments: This simple
act shows your friend that you’re supportive and really care. A simple
smile can mean a lot.
 Leaning forward slightly: When people are really paying attention to
what’s being said, they often lean slightly forward and toward the
person who’s talking. This gesture shows your family member that
you’re truly interested.
When you’re talking to someone, you have your own basic self-talk going on
in your mind. Whether your basic thoughts are trivial or deep ones, you do
your friend or loved one credit by actually listening to what she’s saying and
then responding. And if you can’t listen now, because you’re stressed out or
worried or tired, tell your friend that you’re distracted now, but you’ll really
listen later today or tomorrow — and follow through!
Paying attention to body language
Although words do matter, what someone says isn’t the only thing that
counts.
In addition to paying attention to what your friend or family member with
FMS says, also pay attention to what he doesn’t say: Watch his body language.
These gestures and postures indicate how he really feels, despite what he
may say. For example, a person who’s standing with his arms crossed over
his chest is often annoyed or impatient (or both). A person who’s leaning for-
ward toward you as you talk is truly interested in what you’re saying.
Observe your loved one’s body language when you’re interacting with each
other. For example, if you’ve asked her to go shopping or invited her to come
with you to a family party, and she’s said that she’d love to come, but you see
that she’s slumped over and her eyes are glazed over, here’s the reality: The
mouth is saying yes, but her entire aura is emphatically saying no. Make
some excuse about not going, and you’ll usually see at least a glimmer of
relief wash over your pal.
261
Chapter 19: Helping Someone You Care About Who’s Hurting

Coping with Your Own Emotions
You know that your friend or family member with FMS is hurting, and you feel
sad for him. You probably also feel some other emotions as well — some that
you may prefer to ignore because maybe you don’t feel so proud of them. I’m
talking about negative emotions, such as anger, frustration, resentment, and
so forth. Or maybe you feel guilty for being healthy when your friend or loved
one is feeling terrible.
Negative emotions are normal in life, and coping with them by confronting
them head-on is ideal. Don’t pretend that everything is perfect and that you
really don’t have these feelings at all. Instead, deal with the anger, frustration,
and guilt so that you can better support your friend or loved one who’s suf-
fering. Read on for advice on how to do just that.
Dealing with anger
Anger is a common emotion for people who see people they care about in the
grips of pain. Sometimes, you may get angry at the person who has fibromyal-
gia, possibly for complaining so much and for seeming so totally focused on
the pain — so that not much else seems to matter. Other times, you may be
angry at the FMS or the unfairness of it.
262
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 
What people with FMS say they wish others 
would know, say, or do
Because you don’t have fibromyalgia yourself,
knowing what to say or do to help your friend or
loved one with this aggravating condition can
often be hard. Here’s some advice from people
with FMS who’ve offered what they wish that
others would know, say, or do:
 Grace says that she wants people to know
that she’s really doing the best that she can,
and on some days, just getting out of bed is
a major accomplishment for her.
 Charles says that he can’t abide whining
himself, but he thinks it certainly helps if
others can see that simple tasks require
much more effort and discipline from a
person with fibromyalgia.
 Lola says that she’d like it if people wouldn’t
get upset if she forgets things or asks the
same question ten times when she’s in the
middle of a fibro fog.
 Frank says that it’s important for other
people to understand that their pain and
exhaustion from other problems isn’t the
same as his. And also, just because he’s
feeling pretty good one day doesn’t mean
that he’ll feel okay the next day.
Fibromyalgia is a chronic problem, with
good days and bad days.

The best way to deal with your anger and to avoid a nonhelpful escalation of
anger is to first acknowledge and accept that the fibromyalgia is here, and it’s
real. Next, try to pinpoint whom or what you’re really angry at. Are you angry
with yourself for not being as understanding and caring as you think that
you’re supposed to be? Or are you angry at the person with FMS, for shutting
you out and focusing on the pain and other symptoms?
After you determine who or what you’re angry at, stand back and think objec-
tively about what’s going on. For some people, making a list of reasons why
you’re angry helps. Making a list may sound silly, but I recommend that you
try this simple tactic anyway — you may find that it helps take some of the
steam out of your anger and also clarifies the issues.
Write down, “I am angry because . . .” and then just write whatever comes to
mind, without censoring your thoughts. You may find that you’re angry
because your friend or family member can’t go to as many places with you as
he did in the past or isn’t as attentive as he once was to you. Or the source of
your anger may be something else altogether. You may think that you’re very
angry and upset about your friend and his sufferings with fibromyalgia, but the
feelings actually stem from something that has nothing to do with him at all.
As you write, you may also find that you’re not just angry, but you’re also
feeling sad, frustrated, anxious, and a host of other emotions. Identify and
acknowledge these emotions. No, they won’t evaporate, but they’re often
much easier to deal with when you realize how you really feel.
Fighting frustration
Feeling powerless and confused when you care about someone who has
fibromyalgia is normal. These emotions fall under the category of frustration.
Certainly, when someone you care about is in pain, excessively fatigued, suf-
fering from a lack of sleep, and has many or all of the other symptoms that
are the features of FMS, you want to help. And when you can’t think how to
help, you’re frustrated because you feel like you can’t do anything.
You may wish that you had a magic wand that you could wave about dramati-
cally, complete with magic words to say to instantly end all the torment for
your loved one. Sadly, magic wands or special incantations won’t make some-
one’s fibromyalgia disappear.
Positive thoughts and even prayer may help you deal with your frustration
because they help you focus on your inability to magically resolve your loved
one’s problem and allow you to give up the illusion of control. The positive
energy that’s conveyed through prayer (or meditation) may also be helpful as
well. If you’re a religious person, you’ll be comforted that your request to
God will be heard; the problem will pass from you to God.
263
Chapter 19: Helping Someone You Care About Who’s Hurting

Getting rid of your guilt
Many people feel guilty when their friends, family members, or other loved
ones are sick. They may have an irrational fear that they somehow made the
person ill, through something that they did or didn’t do and should have
done.
Many people also experience a minor form of survivor’s guilt. If you’re feeling
pretty healthy and fit, but your loved one is suffering a lot, maybe you
wonder why you’re fortunate enough to not be sick when your loved one,
who’s just as good of a person as you are, is suffering. Is it fair? No. But then
illness isn’t really a question of fairness.
You need to get rid of your guilt because it’s not helpful for you or your loved
one. It’s not your fault that she’s sick — you didn’t make it happen. And it
isn’t your friend or loved one’s fault, either. Even if you think that you were
mean or uncaring at one point or failed to do something, that lapse still didn’t
make your loved one develop fibromyalgia.
Get rid of your guilt by trying the following tactics:
 Adopt as a mantra the statement, “It’s not my fault.” FMS in someone
else really isn’t your fault!
 Don’t accept responsibility for alleviating your loved one’s illness.
Provide sympathy and help. But realize you can’t cure him.
 Acknowledge to yourself what you are doing to help your loved one.
When guilt feelings crowd in, think about how you drive her to the
doctor’s office when she’s sick, cook dinner if she’s too tired, and so
forth. Give yourself some mental pats on the back. You deserve it!
Going to Support Meetings
Maybe your friend or family member has suggested that you attend a meeting
for people with fibromyalgia, so that you can gain a deeper understanding of
what it’s really like. Or maybe you’ve come to this conclusion yourself
because you want to have a better grasp of how your loved one feels. Maybe
you can discover some new positive ideas that will help you to help your
loved one feel much better.
If you don’t have time to attend support meetings, maybe you can visit online
groups. You can read what others think and feel and avoid the worry of
anyone challenging you.
264
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

Is attending an FMS support-group meeting in person when you don’t have it
yourself a good idea? It depends. Ask yourself the following questions before
you go to a support-group meeting with your hurting friend:
 Do you really want to go? If you do, fine. If you’re just going because
you feel like you have to go, and you’d rather watch grass grow or clean
the attic (or another activity not in your top 100 favorite things to do),
rethink accompanying the person with FMS to the meeting. Sometimes
resentment crowds out positive feelings that you may have.
 Is it convenient to go, or are you making a heroic effort that may
cause you major resentment if you don’t have a good time? If you think
that you’re making a giant sacrifice to go, think again about attending.
 Are you curious about fibromyalgia and eager to meet other people
with FMS, to better help your loved one? This mindset is a thumbs-up
indicator for going.
 Can you cope with people in the group who may see you as someone
who can’t possibly understand or even someone who’s part of the
problem? Find out if other people who don’t have FMS also go to the
meetings and if others (people who don’t have fibromyalgia) are per-
ceived as outsiders and intruders. If so, you may want to reconsider.
265
Chapter 19: Helping Someone You Care About Who’s Hurting
When you live with a person with FMS
When you’re the partner of a person with
fibromyalgia, being sympathetic, kind, and
loving all the time can be hard. Here are a few
guidelines for partners:
 If you find yourself occasionally flaring up
or saying something mean or unfair, give
yourself a timeout away from the person
with FMS. Later, when you’ve cooled down,
apologize.
 Try to help your partner work toward solu-
tions to resolve her symptoms, but realize
that it’s not up to you to make everything
better. In fact, you can’t. You can offer sym-
pathy and support, but when it comes to
acting, the ball is in her court, not yours.
 Ask your partner what he needs when he
feels ill. Sometimes, people think that
everyone somehow knows (or should know)
what they need, whether it’s a kind word,
driving them somewhere because they
don’t feel well enough to drive, or some-
thing else. You’re not a mind reader. If you
ask but your partner won’t tell you what he
needs, then don’t worry about it. Playing
guess-what-he-wants is too frustrating.
 Don’t expect your partner to be superhu-
man. Often, you’ll see her struggling with
goals, and you may feel like the problem is
that she isn’t taking good care of herself.
Although FMS patients greatly benefit from
a disciplined lifestyle (exercising, eating
right, sleeping enough, avoiding stress, and
so forth), they can’t be perfect at all times.
Sometimes it’s okay to slip up and watch TV
all day, eat junk food, and so forth.

T
ommy is a 13-year-old boy who’s been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He
says that he’s had aches and pains ever since he can remember, and his
doctor had always told his concerned parents that Tommy was having “grow-
ing pains.” Tommy first found out that he might have fibromyalgia when his
allergist noticed characteristic symptoms and recommended that Tommy see
a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist examined Tommy, ran some tests, and
diagnosed him with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).
Tommy says that having fibromyalgia can be pretty tough sometimes. The
pain and fatigue are difficult to put up with, and other kids don’t seem to
understand. His teachers haven’t been sympathetic either, and he thinks
most of them have never heard the word fibromyalgia, or at least not in rela-
tion to kids. Sometimes they seem to think that he’s trying to get out of
things, like homework assignments.
As Tommy’s story shows, children and adolescents can have fibromyalgia,
although the juvenile version has some differences from the adult kind, based
on the few studies performed on children. In fact, in the case of children,
their illness is technically called juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome.
In this chapter, I talk about what fibromyalgia is like in children and teens, and
offer advice on how to help your child. I also talk about dealing with your other
children who don’t have fibromyalgia and avoiding the problem of their con-
cluding that you have to be sick to get any attention. Communicating with

268
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 
teachers is another issue; you need to know what to tell them (and what not to
tell them) in order to achieve the best outcome. Peers and what they think can
also be a problem, so, in this chapter, I discuss ways to handle other children.
Keep in mind that, no matter how great a parent you are, you can’t magically
make fibromyalgia disappear, nor can you make everything “all better” for
your child. Also (and this is important, so make it your mantra if you need
to), it’s not your fault. Help your child as much as you can, but realize that you
can’t make the illness go away.
Looking at Fibromyalgia Symptoms 
in Children and Teens
If you think that your child or adolescent may have fibromyalgia, what sort of
symptoms should you be watching out for, and how is juvenile FMS different
from, or the same as, adult fibromyalgia? In many cases, fibromyalgia in chil-
dren is pretty much the same as FMS in adults. But as in Tommy’s case, many
pediatricians may dismiss muscle aches and pains and tiredness, perceiving
them as normal unspecific pains, or they may ignore other common
fibromyalgia symptoms, such as trouble getting to sleep.
In this section, I talk about the major symptoms seen in children with
fibromyalgia, including some similar to and different from those seen in
adults with FMS.
Showing fewer tender points than adults
Although the tender points of fibromyalgia (see Chapter 8) are present when
kids have FMS, some pediatric rheumatologists say that children with
fibromyalgia have fewer tender points than adults, and the tender points that
they do have are most likely to be found in the neck area. Children are less
likely than adults to have tender areas in the lower back. Of course, if your
child is a teenager, she may have low-back tender areas; as children grow
closer to adulthood, they may develop more tender points, mimicking the
tender points seen in adults with FMS.
Suffering from more stomachaches
Some research indicates that children with fibromyalgia suffer from a greater
incidence of stomachaches and abdominal pains than adults who have FMS.

Perhaps the stress of fibromyalgia increases the rate of this problem, or
maybe it’s something else altogether. If your child is having many stom-
achaches, make sure that he or she gets a medical checkup.
Having poor sleep (like adults)
Most adults with FMS have a tough time with insomnia, and unfortunately,
children with fibromyalgia share this symptom. Children with juvenile
fibromyalgia may be more likely to have sleep disorders than other children.
In a study of children diagnosed with juvenile fibromyalgia (reported in a
2000 issue of Pediatrics), researchers performed sleep studies of 16 children
with fibromyalgia and compared their results to 16 children without
fibromyalgia. The children with fibromyalgia had significantly more sleep
problems.
For example, the FMS children took much longer to fall asleep, and had
increased levels of wakefulness during sleep. Of the 16 children diagnosed
with fibromyalgia, 6 were positive for a sleep disorder known as periodic limb
movements in sleep (PLMS). PLMS refers to an excessive level of leg move-
ments while asleep. The researchers recommended that children diagnosed
with juvenile fibromyalgia should be evaluated in sleep clinics to determine
whether they experience treatable sleep problems.
In addition, it seems logical that children diagnosed with sleep problems
should also be evaluated for fibromyalgia. Keep in mind that erratic sleep
patterns sometimes occur in healthy adolescents and, by themselves, prob-
ably don’t indicate fibromyalgia unless the teen also has muscle aches and
other symptoms of FMS.
Is it FMS, or a way for a child to get out of going to school? One possible
screening mechanism is to look for a sustained pattern of fibromyalgia symp-
toms. For example, if Dylan or Caitlin has aches and pains on a school day,
but feels fine at the end of the day or on weekends and holidays, fibromyalgia
most likely isn’t the problem!
Discovering other key FMS symptoms
Experts say that if your child has all or most of the following symptoms, the
underlying problem may be fibromyalgia. These symptoms may be troubling
enough that the child really can’t cope with going to school on some days, or,
with some children, on many days:
 Widespread pain
 Back and neck pain
269
Chapter 20: Parenting a Child or Adolescent with Fibromyalgia

 Joint pain without apparent swelling
 Fatigue
 Morning stiffness
 Frequent headaches
 Abdominal complaints, such as diarrhea or constipation
Accurately Diagnosing the Problem
Of all the groups of people who may have FMS, children may have the most
difficult time getting a proper diagnosis. This situation can make it hard on
both parents and their hurting children. Diagnosing fibromyalgia in children
can be problematic because:
 Few people, including doctors, realize how prevalent it is. About 2 
percent to 8 percent of school children qualify for the diagnosis of
fibromyalgia.
 Many pediatricians know little about the disease, and some don’t
believe that FMS is a valid medical problem among children. It always
must be something else, in their view. And if it’s not medical, it must be a
psychological problem. (Actually FMS can lead to depression, although
that makes the fibromyalgia itself no less real.)
 Parents are unfamiliar with the diagnosis and may find it hard or
impossible to believe that their children could have FMS. They may
believe what others tell them — that FMS is just another fad diagnosis.
They’re wrong, but, sadly, perceptions can be powerful. This means that
children who have fibromyalgia continue to hurt.
The pediatrician or other physician should never rush into a diagnosis of
juvenile fibromyalgia. Your child may have another serious medical problem,
such as arthritis, thyroid disease, an infection, an injury, or another medical
condition. Doctors should perform a physical examination, take a complete
medical history, and rule out other diseases with medical tests, such as tests
of the blood or urine. Sometimes, the child will need more-specialized tests.
If your child is diagnosed with FMS, the next step is to find help for her.
Finding Help for Your Child with FMS
Suppose that you’re convinced that your child has fibromyalgia. What’s the
first step? When deciding where to get help for your child or teen, start with
his pediatrician, even though some pediatricians are wary of diagnosing
270
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

fibromyalgia in children. If you find that your child’s pediatrician is completely
unsympathetic and unwilling to seek out the cause of your child’s symptoms,
you may want to look for another pediatrician. My guidelines for finding a new
doctor, in Chapter 7, can be adapted to finding a new pediatrician.
Your child’s pediatrician may also decide that the child needs to see another
physician. In most cases, the child with FMS-like symptoms should see a
pediatric rheumatologist or a pediatric neurologist, specialists experienced
with treating joint and muscle disorders, including fibromyalgia, in children.
If your child needs to see a pediatric rheumatologist, your pediatrician can
provide a referral for that.
A pediatric rheumatologist is a physician trained in medical problems of the
joints and soft tissues and who specializes in treating children and adoles-
cents with these problems. Fibromyalgia is a condition that pediatric rheuma-
tologists are trained to diagnose and treat.
Treating a Child with Fibromyalgia
Children with fibromyalgia are treated much the same way as adults,
although, of course, any medication dosages must be adjusted for the child’s
weight, and the doctor should also take into account any other drugs the
child is taking. When thinking about what medications to prescribe or what
over-the-counter drugs to recommend to parents, doctors should always con-
sider potential problems that may occur with a person who’s still growing
and maturing. If the doctor doesn’t mention it, ask her about potential side
effects that can affect growing children. Drugs do have side effects, so no one
should be nonchalant about prescribing medication for children.
It can be very hard on parents when their children have medical problems that
others are suspicious about. The child says that she’s in pain or is too tired to
get up, but your mother says that she’s just lazy, and your uncle says that
you’re coddling her. Maybe you have some underlying doubts about whether
your daughter is faking it, or if she could be a hypochondriac. These attitudes
are the same kind that adults with FMS face. But if the doctor has confirmed
that fibromyalgia is present, assume that it’s real. And stop worrying about
what everyone else thinks or feels. Your ill child urgently needs you to be her
advocate.
Using medication
Low doses of mild antidepressants, such as Elavil (generic name: amitriptyline),
administered in the evening, may help your child with sleep difficulties and also
ease pain. However, the child may complain of feeling very sleepy in the morn-
ing with this medicine, and some children also complain of headaches.
271
Chapter 20: Parenting a Child or Adolescent with Fibromyalgia

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), over-the-counter or pre-
scribed, may be considered as well. These include over-the-counter drugs
like ibuprofen and prescribed drugs like Celebrex (generic name: celecoxib)
or Mobic (generic name: meloxicam).
Pediatricians report that NSAIDs usually are more effective at treating arthri-
tis in children than they are with treating kids with juvenile fibromyalgia,
although NSAIDs may give some relief to some children with FMS. The pri-
mary side effect identified with NSAIDs is stomach upset, and continued use
of NSAIDs can result in gastritis (stomach inflammation). (You can read more
about over-the-counter drugs for fibromyalgia in Chapter 9 and about pre-
scribed medications for FMS in Chapter 10.)
Trying therapy
Because depression or anxiety often accompanies fibromyalgia, the child or
adolescent may benefit from receiving therapy as well as from taking anti-
depressants. As with adults, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which
teaches the child how to challenge irrational or negative thoughts, is one of
the most effective types of therapy. According to a study of 67 children with
fibromyalgia, reported in a 2005 issue of the Journal of Pediatric Psychology,
CBT given over eight weeks significantly reduced the children’s pain, fatigue,
and anxiety, as well as improved their sleep quality.
A child psychologist can provide CBT. However, a child psychiatrist is the
most suitable professional to prescribe medications, such as antidepressants
or anti-anxiety drugs, as well as other medications used to treat emotional
problems. Medical doctors who aren’t psychiatrists can also prescribe medi-
cations, but they’re not usually as knowledgeable about medications for emo-
tional problems as are child psychiatrists.
Your child doesn’t have to be mentally ill in order to see a child psychiatrist
or psychologist. Psychiatrists and psychologists often see children with
minor to major emotional problems, and depression is very common among
children.
If you take your child with fibromyalgia to see a therapist, make sure that the
therapist understands that the pain and symptoms of FMS are not solely cre-
ated by the child’s depression, anxiety, conflicts with parents or school, or
other emotional issues. Symptoms may be worsened by such problems, but
they don’t cause the pain. If the therapist accepts that operating assumption,
your child is more likely to succeed with the therapy that’s provided.
272
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

Children up to the age of adolescence (and sometimes even teenagers!) may
enjoy drawing a picture of an imaginary figure, Mr. Fibro, as a way of commu-
nicating how they feel. Tell the child to draw a picture of a person with bad
fibromyalgia symptoms. After the child finishes the drawing, you and the child
can briefly discuss Mr. Fibro. Don’t deny his or her feelings, and let your child
do most of the talking. (Adults often tend to jump in before they’re needed.)
273
Chapter 20: Parenting a Child or Adolescent with Fibromyalgia
Getting rebellious teens to take their meds
Because many adolescents automatically want
to do the opposite of what their parents tell them
to do, getting your teen to cooperate in taking his
fibromyalgia medications can be difficult. Here
are some basic do’s and don’ts that may help.
Don’t:
 Tell the teen to take the medicine because
you said so. That’s a reason for many ado-
lescents not to take it.
 Tell her you’ll give her a gift if she takes the
medicine for a week or some other time
frame. (She’ll continue to expect prizes for
taking her meds, and that’s not a pattern you
want to have to live with long-term.)
 Threaten him that if he doesn’t take his
meds, he’ll be grounded. This can foster
resentment and also viewing of medica-
tions as negative.
 Tell your adolescent that the medication will
help her sleep much better at night and go to
bed easily. Most teens think sleeping at night
is a waste of time—although sleeping late
when morning hits seems like a great idea.
 Lie and say the medication will cure your
teen. Fibromyalgia is a chronic disease and
even the best treatment can’t provide a
complete cure.
Do:
 Find a tailor-made reason for your teen to
take the medication. For example, if your
son loves video games, tell him that the
medicine is likely to ease his pain and
improve his score. If your daughter wants a
more active social life, tell her the medicine
may make this possible.
 Work with the doctor to tie medication
times to meals, such as breakfast or dinner,
or other specific time ranges, such as just
before or after school. This will make it
easier for you both to remember the medi-
cine and get your teenager into a routine.
 Listen to your teen if he complains about
side effects. Maybe the dosage needs to be
decreased or the medication changed.
 If your teen is supposed to take an anti-
depressant or anti-anxiety medication, tell
her that the drug is meant to decrease sad-
ness and confusion — although adoles-
cence is still a tough time.
 Dispense the medication yourself, instead
of handing the bottle over to your teen. An
adolescent can easily forget (accidentally
or on purpose) to take medication.
 Give your adolescent a glass of water with
the medication. He’s more likely to take it
when handed both the water and the med.
If your teen says he’ll take it later, take the
pill back and say you’ll return in an hour.
Often the teen will grab the pill from you
right then and there and swallow it down.

Including Your Children Who 
Don’t Have Fibromyalgia
When your child has a chronic medical problem, and it’s one that your other
children don’t have, you may feel like you’re balancing on a tightrope some-
times. You don’t want to pay so much attention to the sick child that the
healthy children think that they should act sick to be heard and seen. But at
the same time, you can’t ignore FMS, just as you can’t ignore other chronic
medical problems your child may have, such as diabetes, asthma, and so on.
Try to make sure that every child gets “special time” with you, tailoring the
amount of time and the activity to the child. A teenager may need less time
and would probably cringe in horror at the idea of going to a movie with her
parents (and sitting next to them), while a younger child may love this idea. A
walk with your teenager (far away from where you can be seen by anyone he
knows!) may be a good idea instead. And explain that you don’t love the sick
child more or less than your other children. It’s just that, sometimes, the
child with FMS needs a little extra help. If you still see a little resentment in
your kids without FMS, accept that you’ve done your best to mitigate it.
Working with Your Child’s Teacher
The school is a key arena where problems can crop up. If your child is con-
stantly saying that he can’t do schoolwork or can’t participate in gym, teach-
ers may think your child is faking it. What should you do?
Should you tell your child’s teacher that your child has fibromyalgia? You
may think that the answer is an obvious yes (or, for that matter, an obvious
no), but you have to consider some consequences that may occur, whatever
you do (or don’t do). Discussing the illness with the teacher is really an indi-
vidual choice, but do keep in mind several factors:
 Teachers are prone to the same wrong ideas adopted by the general
public. They may think fibromyalgia isn’t a real illness or it’s something
only adults can get.
 The teacher may treat your child differently — not in a good way — if
she thinks that your child is disabled, making the workload too easy
(or sometimes harder) for the child. You want your child to get a good
education and not be given a free pass. Yet, at the same time, you don’t
want your child to feel overwhelmed or physically ill from trying to rec-
oncile her fibromyalgia symptoms with school demands. As a parent,
this path sometimes can be a tough one to navigate.
274
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

Children aren’t allowed to bring any drugs to school in their wallets, purses,
or elsewhere, no matter how benign the drugs may seem to you. Even bring-
ing one aspirin to school is usually forbidden, and a child can be suspended
or expelled for violating this policy. If your child needs to take medication
during school hours, she’s not alone. Bring a doctor’s note or a prescription
bottle with the child’s name on it to the school nurse, and explain what’s
needed. And don’t worry. Many children have to take medicine during school
for all sorts of reasons.
Sharing information with teachers
If your child is missing a lot of school due to fibromyalgia, you may decide
that you have to tell the teacher. Most schools have a limit of how many days
can be missed before alarm bells go off in the school system, and someone,
somewhere, may start to suspect that your child is playing hooky.
If you do decide to tell your child’s teacher about the fibromyalgia, consider
the following points:
 Describe to the teacher what fibromyalgia is. She may never have heard
of it. Explain that it is a problem that both adults and children can have,
with key symptoms of pain, fatigue, muscle stiffness, and sleep problems.
And many children with FMS have frequent headaches as well.
 Tell the teacher that you don’t want your child to avoid doing his
schoolwork. If he can’t handle the work during school time, ask the
teacher if your child can bring it home or have a few days of extra time
to complete the work.
 Offer to help ensure that your child completes her schoolwork. This
offer may present an extra burden on you, but it’ll usually pay off in
terms of getting cooperation and respect from your child’s teacher.
 Explain to the teacher that you don’t expect your child to be perma-
nently excused from physical education. On some days, the child may
be able to cope with his regular schoolwork, but he won’t be able to
handle the demands of gym class.
 If the teacher expresses doubt about fibromyalgia, don’t flare up and
call him an ignoramus. Instead, tell him that you understand his con-
cerns. But point out that, in past years, many people didn’t realize that
children could suffer from ulcers, depression, and other medical prob-
lems. Tell him that FMS is a similar case.
 Offer to share this book with the teacher (or buy her a copy), so that
she can find out more about fibromyalgia. Point out this chapter to
her. Sometimes, when people read information in a book, it has more
credibility than when you tell them the same thing.
275
Chapter 20: Parenting a Child or Adolescent with Fibromyalgia

Holding off on informing teachers
Maintaining a total nondisclosure policy about your child having an illness
can become difficult after a while, and saying nothing usually isn’t a good
idea because teachers may think that your child has a worse problem than
she has or that something terrible is occurring at home. But you may not
want to share every last detail or even the exact diagnosis. So can you be par-
tially forthcoming, without spilling all the beans? It’s harder, but it’s possible.
Consider the following choices:
 Tell the teacher that your child has some medical problems that make it
hard for him to concentrate right now. You’re working on helping the
child resolve these problems.
 Tell the teacher that your child has an illness that’s similar to a mild
form of arthritis.
 Ask the teacher to keep your information confidential. (Even when
you’ve told her practically nothing.) Be sure to tell her whether she may
(or may not) tell the other children or other teachers.
Not telling the teacher (or limiting what you tell him) has several benefits.
Children are often embarrassed by information about them that’s given by
parents to teachers, especially if they think it’s negative. They may also fear
being regarded as weak or disabled, and some teachers might treat them that
way if they knew about the fibromyalgia. Other teachers may regard children
with fibromyalgia as hypochondriacs, no matter how hard you work at edu-
cating them. Teachers are part of the world, too, and they have their flaws,
although most are understanding.
Handling difficult teachers
Sometimes, no matter how well you explain your child’s problem and how
helpful you try to be with the teacher, the situation deteriorates. The teacher
starts telling others, including (worst case) other children, about your child’s
medical problem. Or she doesn’t believe that Caitlin is really sick, and says so
aloud to others. Other problems may also develop.
In such cases, the best thing to do is to ask for a meeting with the principal and
the teacher to share your concerns. Don’t be scared to ask for such a meeting!
Write down the main one or two points you’d like to discuss at the meeting to
make sure that you cover them. Plan ahead to be polite but firm.
Don’t be intimidated, even if you’re forced to sit in a little chair meant for a
small child. Your initial reaction, when you come to the meeting, may be to
feel like you’ve been called to the principal’s office. Remind yourself that you
asked for this meeting.
276
Part V: Managing Fibromyalgia at Work and at Home 

Take notes in case the teacher or principal offers any good suggestions or
agrees to some of your ideas. At the end of the meeting, summarize what
you’ve agreed upon. “Okay, so my understanding is that Ms. Jones won’t talk
about Dylan’s health to the other children anymore,” or whatever it is.
Dealing with Jeers from Peers
One of the toughest criticisms your child will have to face, whatever her
problems, is that of her own peers. Children can be very cruel, taunting each
other because they’re fat (or skinny), wear glasses (or squint because they
should wear glasses), are average (or are smart), and so on. When a child has
a medical problem, such as fibromyalgia, kids may see this as just another
thing to pick on. The child with fibromyalgia usually looks normal to others,
but when he hangs back from activities because of pain and fatigue, the other
kids will notice. It is particularly difficult when the child is a teenager,
although kids can be mean at any age.
Other children aren’t necessarily evil bullies (although it may seem that way
to the child who’s being verbally attacked). More often, the children are frus-
trated or upset about something else and take out their powerlessness on
other children. It’s not your job to analyze troubled children — focus instead
on helping your own child.
Seeing your child unhappy is heartbreaking. So what should you do? Here are
a few suggestions, with the warning that they don’t always work. Sadly, I can’t
offer you the one magic phrase that makes the blinders fall from the eyes of
other children — or adults. But I hope they help.
If your child is bullied
Most assaults aren’t physical, but it’s not true that “sticks and stones may
break my bones, but names will never hurt me.” Name-calling does hurt, and
it often hurts a lot. You may think that reasoning or explaining the fibromyal-
gia to the other child can help — sometimes it does, but often it doesn’t.
Name-calling is about power — it’s not about understanding. And don’t think
girls are exempt from making verbal attacks. Actually, some girls can be quite
emotionally abusive.
Of course, explaining to your child that he has a disease that’s like arthritis
may help in some cases, so that’s one way to go. Teach your child simple
explanations of what fibromyalgia is — for example, that it’s a medical prob-
lem that causes the body to hurt and get tired fast. Avoid complexities. Of
course, if your child is an adolescent, more details will be needed. But keep in
mind that many teens think in either/or terms — things are wonderful or
they’re terrible — so don’t expect comprehension of subtleties.
277
Chapter 20: Parenting a Child or Adolescent with Fibromyalgia

Sometimes, ignoring (or pretending to ignore) other children can help
because they usually get bored or tired of the teasing. Most children have a
fairly short attention span, and if the object of their bad attention seems
unaffected, they’ll move on to something or someone else.
If the teasing becomes constant and chronic, you can talk to the child doing
the bullying, if you keep it non-threatening and simple. You can also talk to
the child’s parents, who may be horrified to find out about the verbal abuse.
Some of them won’t be, however — they may actually be part of the problem.
If the bullying occurs on school grounds, talk to the teacher. Many schools
have anti-bullying policies, which may cover the child from when she starts
to walk or ride the bus to or from school all the way through the time she’s
actually at school.
If your child is physically attacked
Sometimes, other children or adolescents can become physically abusive,
and taunting may escalate to pushing and even punching. If this type of vio-
lence happens to your child, it’s illegal. Report it to the school authorities if it
happens at school, and if the abuse is beyond a few minor pushes, report it
to the local police as well. Remind yourself that a bullying child who can be
stopped and rehabilitated now is less likely to grow up to become an adult
who assaults others. But above all, protect your child from physical harm.
That’s part of your job as a parent.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
hat would a For Dummies book be without the
famous Part of Tens? If you like quick and easy-to-

Part VI provides ten pieces of advice on alternative reme-
dies and fibromyalgia, ten mistakes to avoid when you
have fibromyalgia, ten ways to cope with the confusion
(brain fog or fibro fog) of fibromyalgia, and ten myths
about this medical problem. I offer some valuable advice
in this don’t-miss part of the book.

Chapter 21
Ten Alternative Remedies That
Help People with Fibromyalgia
In This Chapter
 Spotting dangerous remedies
 Considering alternative remedies for sleep
 Rubbing out the pain and fatigue
 Smelling your way to health with aromatherapy
 Mudding out the pain
 Homeopathizing to improve your fibromyalgia symptoms
 Electrically stimulating pain to reduce it
M
ost people with fibromyalgia actively seek relief from their insomnia,
pain, fatigue, and brain fog. Often, that relief comes in the form of
alternative remedies, such as supplements and herbs, homeopathic reme-
dies, aromatherapy, mud baths, and other treatments. In fact, in one study of
289 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), 98 percent said they had
used some type of alternative therapy to cope with their symptoms in the
past six months.
That said, many people think anything labeled as “natural” is automatically
good. But poison ivy is natural, and you wouldn’t want to rub it all over your
body. Another common misconception is that if a product is sold in the United
States, it must be safe. Yet federal laws on vitamins and supplements are less
restrictive than laws on prescribed and over-the-counter medications.

Ask questions about alternative remedies before using them. Consider using
online databases, such as the Office of Dietary Supplements, for information.
Go to http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets for information on many
herbal remedies. At the very least, find answers to the following questions:
 What are the side effects of this remedy? Every drug — including “nat-
ural” ones — has potential side effects.
 Is this remedy likely to interact with my other medications?
 Is this remedy okay for someone with my health history?
 How long should I use this remedy before expecting results? Some
remedies act fairly quickly, while others have a more cumulative effect.
Avoid any remedy sold by someone promising an instant cure. If there were
an instant cure for fibromyalgia, its success wouldn’t be trumpeted solely on
some obscure Web site. Stay away from any remedy sold by people urging
you not to tell your doctor you’re taking it. Honest people won’t give such
advice. Instead, they’ll offer studies and/or information to share with your
doctor. (For tips on avoiding alternative-remedy scams, read Chapter 12.)
I’ve discussed the downside of alternative medicine, but what about the posi-
tive aspects? There are definite benefits to using alternative medicine when
you have fibromyalgia, such as the symptom relief you may get from using
supplements and herbs, as well as the relief you can get from (gentle) mas-
sage therapy, acupuncture, and other options.
Herbs
Difficulty getting and/or staying asleep is a major problem for many people
with fibromyalgia, who may turn to alternative remedies that have sedating
properties, such as:
 Melatonin: Melatonin is a supplement that’s similar to natural mela-
tonin, which is made by the pineal gland in the brain. It’s sometimes
used by jet-lagged travelers whose day/night cycle has gone awry.
Potential side effects: Melatonin may cause headaches.
 Valerian: Used since the time of the ancient Greeks, this herbal remedy
may sedate you so that you can get the sleep you need. Potential side
effects: Valerian is generally safe to use for four to six weeks, according
to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
However, it can cause headaches, upset stomach, and dizziness.
 Chamomile: Generally taken as a tea, chamomile has sedating qualities
that may help you sleep. Potential side effects: Chamomile may slightly
decrease blood clotting and should not be taken by those on blood 
thinners.

Magnesium
Some supplements may help with pain; for example, magnesium is used by
some patients with FMS, particularly those who may be slightly deficient in
this mineral. Magnesium may improve fibromyalgia symptoms.
Avoid megadoses, because magnesium can also cause stomach upset and
diarrhea. (Follow your doctor’s recommendations.)
Echinacea
What if your primary problem is not insomnia or pain but rather excruciating
fatigue? Echinacea may help you. It’s a popular herb among people with
fibromyalgia who need to increase their energy levels. Among patients in a
Mayo Clinic Proceedings study published in 2005, of those ages 18 to 24 years
old with fibromyalgia, 29 percent used echinacea to decrease fatigue. Fatigue-
reducing remedies should not be taken within three hours of when you want
to sleep.
Echinacea is generally safe but it may cause allergic reactions. Stomachaches
are a more common reaction from echinacea than are allergic reactions.
Green Tea
Many people with fibromyalgia use herbal remedies to decrease their symp-
toms of both pain and fatigue. Based on a survey of fibromyalgia patients
published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2005, green tea was the most fre-
quently used herb, used by 24 percent of all respondents. Green tea can
increase energy.
Green tea should be taken in moderation because it can cause insomnia,
upset stomach, and anxiety, and may raise blood pressure. It can also reduce
the effects of anti-clotting drugs such as Coumadin (generic name: warfarin).
Massage Therapy
Many people with FMS find that massage therapy helps relieve pain and
stress, whether they hire professional massage therapists or enlist the aid of
a loved one.

Chapter 21: Ten Alternative Remedies That Help People with Fibromyalgia

Whoever gives you a massage should be sure not to rub too hard on your
tender points! (Read more about massage therapy in Chapter 11.)
Aromatherapy
Inhaling the scent of lovely flowers or other pleasant smells may temporarily
elevate your mood as well as help you relax. Proponents of aromatherapy
(using odors to improve overall general health) are convinced that this is true.
You can purchase aromatherapy products in many different places. Even
local pharmacies and supermarkets offer many different types of fragrances
in the form of oils, lotions, and many other options. Lavender is a popular
choice to help to calm and destress you, as are jasmine, geranium, or
patchouli.
You may also want to consult an aromatherapy expert. Ask your local health-
food store for names of people in your area who are experts in aromatherapy.
Mud Baths
It may remind you of making mud pies in kindergarten, but sitting in a hot
mud bath may give you some relief from fibromyalgia symptoms. A 1999
study conducted in Italy indicated that mud baths, combined with antide-
pressants, gave subjects significant relief from fibromyalgia symptoms. Mud
baths are more popular in Europe than they are in the United States.
Generally, in the U.S., you can find spas with mud baths on the West Coast,
particularly in California.
Further study is needed before scientists will know if mud baths are a valid
treatment for fibromyalgia. But don’t tell that to Mandy, a long-time FMS suf-
ferer. She says she feels great after her mud bath, which she receives in a spa
every few weeks. She soaks in a hot tub of peat moss for 20 minutes.
Afterward, she washes up and rests for half an hour so she’ll be alert enough
to drive home. Relief lasts for days, although Mandy can’t afford mud-bath
treatments more frequently than every other week, because they cost $80 a
shot. (Prices vary from one spa to the next.)

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Acupuncture
Many people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain conditions have
turned to acupuncture, a therapy in which tiny pins are inserted at or near
the pain sites. Some studies have shown that acupuncture is effective in tem-
porarily decreasing the pain of people with fibromyalgia. (Read more about
acupuncture in Chapter 11.)
Homeopathy
Some people with fibromyalgia swear by homeopathy, which is based on the
principle that a substance that would normally be dangerous may be benefi-
cial in tiny amounts. For example, if along with your fibromyalgia symptoms
you also suffer from chronic headaches, homeopathic doses of belladonna
(normally a poison) may help you feel better. (Read more about homeopathic
remedies and fibromyalgia symptoms in Chapter 12.)
Transcutaneous Electrical 
Nerve Stimulators
Some patients obtain significant relief by using Transcutaneous Electrical
Nerve Stimulator (TENS) units. TENS units are devices that emit low-level
electrical pulses, which can decrease your pain significantly. In fact, TENS is
nearly a mainstream remedy and is used by physical therapists and other
medical professionals. (Read more about TENS in Chapter 11.)

Ten Mistakes to Avoid When You
Have Fibromyalgia
In This Chapter
 Failing to get a diagnosis as you try to ignore your symptoms
 Believing a doctor who says your symptoms are “all in your head”
 Trying one medicine or therapy, and if it doesn’t work, giving up altogether on
treatment
 Obsessing about fibromyalgia as the cause of all your problems
 Assuming that somehow you (or others) caused your symptoms
D
ebbie, age 40, said that when her fibromyalgia symptoms first started
about three years ago, she ignored them. They got much worse as time
passed, but she figured, hey, mind over matter, and she was a strong person
who could tough it out and cope. Eventually, the symptoms became so severe
that Debbie decided, “That’s it. I have to go see a doctor.” After taking a care-
ful medical history and doing a complete workup, the doctor diagnosed
Debbie with severe fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). He also asked her why on
earth she had waited so long before seeking help.
Debbie made the mistake of trying to ignore her chronic medical problem,
rather than seeking a diagnosis and getting treatment and, as a result, she
suffered unnecessarily. That’s one common mistake made by many people
with symptoms of fibromyalgia. But there are others as well, such as believ-
ing a physician who mistakenly tells you that fibromyalgia is an imaginary
problem, and that your pain isn’t real. Or assuming that your symptoms are
all your fault or the fault of others in your life. I discuss these and other
common mistakes in this chapter, explaining why they are mistakes and what
you should do instead.

288
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Ignoring Your Pain and 
Hoping It Goes Away
Many people try to ignore their pain and the other symptoms of fibromyalgia,
hoping they’ll somehow magically go away. In fact, many minor pains that
people experience eventually do go away, such as a temporary stomach upset
from something that you ate, a bruise from a minor fall, and so forth. But when
your pain and other symptoms hang on, continue to escalate, and become
harder and harder to ignore, pretending they’re not there is a mistake.
Chronic pain is an indication that something is wrong and that you should
consult a physician. (Read Chapter 4 for further information on the pain of
fibromyalgia.)
Believing a Doctor Who 
Says Fibromyalgia Is 
“All in Your Head”
Although most doctors now realize that fibromyalgia is a legitimate medical
problem, some physicians continue to think that your symptoms are “all in
your head.” If you keep complaining, such doctors may eventually send you
to the nearest psychiatrist for treatment or may put you on mild antidepres-
sants or anti-anxiety medications. In fact, you could also have depression or
an anxiety disorder, and these medications could help you. (Read more about
depression and anxiety disorders in Chapter 2.)
But what you really need is a good diagnosis and a treatment plan for your
underlying main problem. If it’s fibromyalgia, then you need a diagnosis of
FMS and a treatment plan for it. So if you find that your doctor isn’t listening
to you or tells you that your symptoms are imaginary and you’re really just
fine, find another physician. (Read Chapter 7 for some tips on identifying a
good doctor.)
Trying One Medication or Therapy, and 
If It Doesn’t Work, Giving Up
Some people are willing to try one medication or therapy to resolve their
fibromyalgia symptoms, but if that one particular drug or treatment doesn’t

give them any relief, they decide that there’s nothing they can do but learn to
live with the chronic pain and fatigue of fibromyalgia. Don’t make this mistake!
In the case of drugs, physicians can prescribe many different types of medica-
tions, such as painkillers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and other medi-
cations. There are also many individual medications within those types, which
may help you. For example, if one painkiller doesn’t work or causes serious
side effects that are intolerable for you, a different painkiller with few or no
side effects may help you. And if one antidepressant doesn’t ease your symp-
toms, a different antidepressant may give you the relief that you truly long for.
Give the medicine that your doctor prescribes a fair trial of a week or two
(unless you have severe side effects), and then, if you see no improvement,
tell your doctor it’s just not working. Ask her what your other options are. If
she recommends another medication, seriously consider her suggestion.
Keep in mind that many people with FMS need more than one medication,
and that you may need to take two or more drugs to gain control over your
FMS symptoms.
An array of other therapies may improve your symptoms as well, such as
acupuncture, icing or heating the painful areas, using Botox injections, and
many other options. Some people may try one form of therapy, and if they get
no relief, they give up. But another therapy could provide them with consid-
erable symptomatic relief. (Read about acupuncture and icing and heating in
Chapter 11; turn to Chapter 12 for more on alternative remedies such as
Botox injections.)
Assuming That the Problem 
Is All Your Fault
Some people with symptoms of fibromyalgia assume that they somehow
caused the problem themselves. They may think that they’re weak or bad
and that the pain is some sort of retribution that the body is taking out on
them. They may also think that if only they didn’t drink/smoke/overeat/some-
thing else, then they’d be just fine. Of course, it’s a bad idea to smoke, drink
alcohol, or eat to excess, but it doesn’t mean that these actions directly
caused your fibromyalgia. And certainly fibromyalgia is not punishment for
your past sins.
When you think you deserve to suffer, you can get mired in that suffering.
Liberate yourself. See your physician and work on identifying the means to
relieve your symptoms.
289
Chapter 22: Ten Mistakes to Avoid When You Have Fibromyalgia

Assuming That the Problem 
Is Everyone Else’s Fault
Sometimes people don’t think that their FMS symptoms are their fault at all.
Instead, they think that the symptoms are everyone else’s fault. If only your
boss were nicer or your children would just do what you tell them to do. If
only your spouse or partner would remember that you hate broccoli and
stop buying it. In other words, if everyone else were perfectly nice to you,
then you’d feel just fine.
There are several problems with this belief. First, everyone else can’t be nice
to you all the time. Secondly, even if they could be, fibromyalgia is caused by
a problem from within your body. Sure, stress can make it worse. (Read
Chapter 13 for more on stress.) But, with the exception of post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD; see Chapter 3), caused by an extreme emotional crisis,
everyday stress doesn’t cause FMS in the first place. So if you’re making the
mistake of blaming everyone else for your symptomatic flare-ups, stop it —
right now. Instead, work with your doctor to create a plan to improve your
situation.
Turning to Alcohol or Other Substances
Some studies have shown that people with fibromyalgia have a risk of turning
to alcohol or other substances. The pain may be so severe that they seek a
temporary respite from it. The problem with this “solution” is that alcohol
and some other substances (such as excessive use of painkillers or the use of
illegal drugs) can be habit-forming or even addicting, and they can only tem-
porarily take away your pain. So you actually don’t resolve your fibromyalgia
with substance abuse. Instead, you add yet another problem on top of your
FMS problem.
If you find yourself thinking, when you’re in pain from your fibromyalgia, that
maybe having a few drinks would help you feel dramatically better, then think
again. The risks can be very severe with alcohol or drug dependence. You could
lose your driver’s license, your spouse or partner, your children, and even your
life, such as in a car crash or other accident. If you think you may have a prob-
lem with substance abuse, get an evaluation and get some help now.
290
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Believing That All Your Problems 
Are Caused by Fibromyalgia
Some people with chronic diseases, including fibromyalgia, develop the
wrong idea that all their medical problems (and sometimes even all their per-
sonal problems as well) are caused by their FMS. It’s a one-stop shop for
blaming everything that has gone wrong. The reality is that although
fibromyalgia can cause many distressing symptoms for you, you should not
attribute every bad thing that happens in your life to your fibromyalgia.
Also, keep in mind that you could have another medical or psychological
problem altogether, and it may not stem directly from fibromyalgia. For exam-
ple, many people with FMS also suffer from arthritis, chronic headaches, irri-
table bowel syndrome, or other medical problems. (Read more about other
medical problems in Chapter 2 and Chapter 6.) You need to get these other
problems identified so that they can be treated, too.
Overeating to Make Yourself Feel Better
Some studies have demonstrated that people with FMS, particularly women,
are more likely to be obese than people without fibromyalgia. The reasons for
this aren’t known, but I’m willing to offer some speculation.
Sometimes when a person has severe chronic pain that doesn’t improve (pos-
sibly because she hasn’t obtained a diagnosis of fibromyalgia or hasn’t gotten
any treatment), she becomes depressed and upset. Instead of seeking treat-
ment, she seeks solace in candy, cakes, pies, and other high-calorie and high-
fat foods. Such foods may provide a temporary good feeling — but it’s one
that doesn’t last.
These individuals also usually fail to exercise because of their pain and
fatigue, which further contributes to being overweight — and is a mistake!
Overeating provides only a very temporary respite from the symptoms of
fibromyalgia, and a lack of exercise increases the pain. (Read Chapter 15 for
information on weight loss and exercise.)
291
Chapter 22: Ten Mistakes to Avoid When You Have Fibromyalgia

Feeling That You’re a Defective Person
Because of Your Fibromyalgia
Some people with fibromyalgia are ashamed and embarrassed by their disor-
der. They may not think that they’re bad people who somehow deserve the
disorder (as discussed earlier in this chapter), but they still feel that they
aren’t as effective as the other people they know at work or in their families.
The reality is that most people, at some time in their lives, have a serious and
chronic medical problem. It may be arthritis, it may be diabetes, it may be
chronic headaches, or it may be something else — but nearly everyone at
some point has a “weak spot.” In your case, your weak spot is fibromyalgia.
FMS is nothing to be embarrassed about. It just is. As long as you’re working
to control your symptoms as best you can, then you’re doing the right thing.
So mentally pat yourself on the back! You deserve it.
Trying to Hide Your Symptoms from
Family, Friends, and Others
Some people with fibromyalgia think that they’re behaving well, even nobly, if
they try to completely hide all their symptoms of pain, fatigue, and fibro fog
from others. They assume that if they don’t complain about their symptoms,
then others won’t notice anything. The fatal flaw in this reasoning is that
others who are close to you nearly always do notice that something is going
on with you. But they may mistakenly believe that you’re angry or upset with
them for something that they’ve done or haven’t done. Or they may mistak-
enly believe that your problem is much worse than fibromyalgia, and that
you have cancer or another terminal illness that you aren’t talking about, for
some reason.
Don’t make this mistake of hiding your symptoms and attempting to be a
martyr. Although you don’t need to report every twinge of pain to your family
members and friends, it’s another story when you’re in severe pain. It’s okay
(and a good idea) to tell others that your fibromyalgia is bothering you a lot
today and that you hope tomorrow will be a better day to go to the
movies/go out to dinner/engage in other activities. (Read Chapter 18 for more
suggestions on how to help your loved ones understand and cope better with
your fibromyalgia symptoms.)

Ten Ways to Beat the Effects 
of Brain Fog
In This Chapter
 Overcoming your mental malaise
 Defining the important tasks
 Working with others to help you stay on task
L
aurie says the forgetfulness, confusion, and overall brain fog that seem to
go together with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) drive her crazy, and she’d
love some helpful hints on how to pull herself together when she starts laps-
ing into la-la land. What she’d really like is for the brain fog (and the fibromyal-
gia) to evaporate like morning mist — except forever (mist comes back the
next day). Barring that, some coping techniques are her order of the day.
This chapter offers Laurie (and you) some basic guidelines on helpful ways
to stay present and focused in the here and now and to achieve most (if not
all) of what you need to get done. If brain fog washes over you anyway, which
often happens, these techniques can help you maintain some semblance of
order in your life. In this chapter, I offer ten basic helpful hints for beating
back your brain fog or averting the effects when you can’t avoid it.
Avoiding Brain and Energy Drains 
When You’re Hurting or Tired
This piece of advice may sound like a no-brainer, but I’ll say it anyway: Don’t
try to tackle difficult problems when your symptoms are in the red (very
high) zone of pain. Many people feel that they must still help their children
with complicated science projects, drive five hours to family reunions, or per-
form other difficult tasks that require more brain power and energy than
anyone can reasonably give when in pain. Is it any wonder, in such cases, that
you become confused and a little foggy?

294
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Think of your mind and body like a glassful of water, brimming with your
active life. Then imagine trying to add more water (work) to the glass
because you think that you should. You get a mess spilling over into your
personal and professional lives. Also, while you’re struggling to take on the
big jobs, you may be ignoring easy and doable tasks that are still within your
capabilities, such as work or household tasks that need to be done.
The best policy is to keep it simple when you’re sick. If you do, you’ll be far
more likely to avoid forgetfulness and confusion and to stay focused. If you
really must do something hard, break it down into smaller tasks, doing some
now and some later.
Asking Others to Help You Stay On Task
If you’re periodically short-circuiting in terms of mental alertness because of
your FMS symptoms, consider making an ally at work or at home who can
help you return to planet Earth. Ask this person to notice if you seem to be
lost in space, brainwise, and to send you a signal if he does. The signal can be
a gentle touch on the arm, a word or phrase that grabs your attention, or
something else.
You can also try a more general approach of telling people that, sometimes,
you get lost in thought and, if you seem inattentive, to please call on you by
name more loudly than usual. (No screaming allowed.)
Making Lists and Checking Them Twice
Listmaking is an efficient procedure for most busy people, and it can really
help a person constrained by fibromyalgia. The only downside of lists is that
many people are overly ambitious about what they can perform in a day or a
week. Write down what you absolutely must do today, and then prioritize
these items from the most important down to the least important. (Don’t
make your first task a nearly impossible one.)
A list can help you focus. And if you’re having a bad day, often you’ll still
have succeeded at doing at least a few things on your list, and you can pat
yourself on the back. No name-calling of yourself, however, if you can’t
accomplish your list items. Remember: Nobody’s perfect.

Banning Self-Blame
Many people become inordinately angry with themselves when they’re sick
and can’t remember to do things (or simply can’t do them, even if they
remember them). Don’t make this mistake — you’re likely to worsen your
brain fog when you cloud your mind with negative self-talk. Does anyone
work better when she’s yelled at? It may work if you’re joining the Marines,
but being yelled at makes most people more confused. Don’t chastise your-
self, either. Do the best you can and let the rest go until tomorrow.
Avoiding Blaming Others
In addition to a tendency to blame yourself for not doing everything you
think that you should be doing, sometimes, when you’re sick, you may find
yourself blaming others for not making your life sufficiently easy. Whether
you self-blame or blame others, you’re likely to worsen your fibro fog. Avoid
this problem. Don’t let others get away with not doing what they’re supposed
to do at home or at work. But don’t blame them just because you feel lousy.
It’s not their fault — or yours.
Getting Enough Sleep
I emphasize the importance of getting enough sleep in other chapters
throughout the book, and guess what? Here it is again. Sufficient sleep (at
least seven hours a night) is vitally important for the brain and the body. You
concentrate better and think more clearly when you’ve thoroughly rested
your entire body through the process known as sleep. If you don’t get enough
sleep, however, you’ll find it much harder to wrap your mind around even the
simplest of concepts — let alone concentrate on serious issues. Get the sleep
you need on a regular basis, and often, the fibro fog will clear up.
Keeping a Calendar of Activities
Another good idea is to keep a calendar of what you’re supposed to do and
when. On a day when you’re not overwhelmed with symptoms, record your
numerous doctor appointments (as well as birthdays and other important
dates and activities that you really need to pay attention to) directly on your
calendar. Forget relying on those little cards doctors give people. You can
easily lose them. Instead, when you get home from a doctor’s appointment,
immediately write down the dates and times of your next appointments on
your calendar. Or staple the cards to a daily calendar.
295
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Beat the Effects of Brain Fog

Watching What You Eat
How can foods that you eat affect your brain’s performance? Simply put,
some foods can impair productivity, making you more sluggish. Others make
sleeping more difficult. (And some foods, such as turkey or milk, can help
you fall asleep.) Read more about good foods/bad foods in Chapter 15.
The following foods can worsen brain fog:
 Caffeine, such as in soft drinks, tea, coffee, and chocolate, hype you up,
making it hard for you to sleep.
 Excessive sugar can make you tired and cranky — definitely not good for
brain fog.
 Foods with additives, such as MSG, can cause agitation. Avoid them.
Putting Things in Their Places
If you’re distracted by your symptoms and prone to misplacing things like
your car keys and important papers, start putting the most important items
in the exact same places. Concentrate on the two or three most important
items you need, but which you keep losing in your fibro fog. For many people,
car keys are a biggie. Some people place their car keys on a ring by the door,
and others put them in another particular place. If you always put the item in
the same place, you’re less likely to waste your time searching for it when
you’re feeling major pain.
Catching Yourself Slipping Away
Sometimes you can actually catch yourself in the act of slipping into a brain
fog and come back to full awareness. Some people use auditory signals to
help, such as an alarm that goes off every half-hour or hour. You can buy spe-
cial watches that beep or pulsate at preprogrammed intervals, or program
your cellphone to jolt you back to the real world by ringing, beeping, or
vibrating. Realize, however, that everyone daydreams or tunes out the world
sometimes, and doing so can be a good thing, as long as it’s just once in a
while.

Ten Myths about Fibromyalgia
In This Chapter
 Mastering the myths and realities of fibromyalgia
 Helping others understand what’s real and not real
 Maintaining your perspective
I
talk about some fibromyalgia myths in other chapters throughout this
book. Some of these myths are that fibromyalgia is imaginary, and that
people who think they’ve got it are either lazy or crazy. Another myth is that
people who say that they have fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) are attention
seekers or that they’re seeking narcotics to get high. Of course, you’ve prob-
ably heard many more myths yourself.
Plenty of myth-busting needs to be done when it comes to fibromyalgia. I
believe that knowledge is power. After you understand what’s most important
to know about fibromyalgia from your own perspective, you may want to
share this information with others and empower them, too.
In this chapter, I cover ten key myths about fibromyalgia and explain why
these myths aren’t valid. You’ll probably recognize at least some of them, and
you may have an “Aha!” reaction with all or most of them.
People with Fibromyalgia 
Are Lazy or Crazy
One of the most common myths about fibromyalgia is that it’s an escape
clause for lazy people who don’t feel like working or for hypochondriacs
imagining that they’re sick. The “lazy or crazy” myth is even believed by a
few doctors, although most physicians know that it isn’t true. Studies indi-
cate that people with FMS are about as active as people who don’t have
fibromyalgia, except when they’re in the middle of a major flare-up of pain
and fatigue.

It only makes sense: When you feel really sick, you can’t work as well as
usual, or maybe you can’t work at all. A truly “lazy” person is physically fit,
but she prefers to do nothing, despite good health.
Nor are people with fibromyalgia delusional (or “crazy”) about their symptoms.
What they feel is real, and it’s no figment of the imagination. It’s true that many
people with fibromyalgia do suffer from problems with depression or anxiety
(see Chapter 2), or from stress (see Chapter 13). But none of these problems
alone makes people develop FMS. Something else causes fibromyalgia.
Fibromyalgia Symptoms Are 
a Way to Get Attention
Another myth that drives people with fibromyalgia wild is that they’re “just
trying to get attention.” Some patients with FMS agree that they’d rather be in
solitary confinement than to suffer a severe flare-up of fibromyalgia. Their
suffering is in no way an attempt to get onto center stage with their friends
and relatives so they can get lots of attention.
People with FMS Just Want Drugs
Because many people with fibromyalgia need painkilling medications at least
some of the time, some people may assume that people with FMS are really
“druggies” seeking an excuse to take strong painkillers or narcotics. Although
some painkilling drugs can be habit forming and they do need close monitor-
ing by physicians, the reality is that people with fibromyalgia who take strong
drugs do so to cope with their severe pain rather than to get high.
Looking Well Means You Are Well
Charlotte was always well dressed, and her general demeanor gave no indica-
tion of the pain that she suffered from fibromyalgia. If you looked really
closely, however, you may sometimes see a tightness around the mouth and
eyes. You may also notice that Charlotte didn’t smile a lot and she rarely
laughed. People thought that Charlotte was a distant kind of person, but the
reality was that she suffered from fibromyalgia. When people told her how
well she looked, she always thought, “If they only knew!”
298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Some illnesses aren’t readily apparent from the outside, and fibromyalgia is
one of them. Most people who have such medical problems may be told that
they look fine, even when they don’t go to great lengths to hide their illness,
like Charlotte. Telling someone that you feel awful only to hear in response,
“But you look so great!” can be truly maddening. Remember (and tell your
friends): Looking wonderful can be the same as feeling wonderful. But when
you have fibromyalgia, that often isn’t the case.
Pain Is Pain: It’s All the Same
All pain is not created equal. If your cousin has pain from arthritis or a bad
back, he may think that his pain is about the same as your pain from
fibromyalgia. (Or he may think that his pain is far worse than yours!) But
studies indicate that the pain from fibromyalgia can be far more intense than
other forms of muscle or joint pain, and it often lasts longer as well. Some
studies have demonstrated that people with fibromyalgia feel pain more
intensely and for a longer period than others.
Feeling Good Today Means You’re Well
Fibromyalgia is a frustrating kind of disease because it’s so unpredictable.
Today, you feel lousy; tomorrow, you feel worse; the next day, you feel okay
or even close to normal. When you tell people that you’re finally having a
good day, many will assume that at long last, you’re “all better.” Many people
have a hard time grasping a medical problem that has a lot of ups and downs
to it, especially when there aren’t any external signs of illness that you can
point to. But that’s the nature of the illness. As with many chronic illnesses,
fibromyalgia isn’t something you just get over. However, you can cope with
the disease in many ways to minimize your pain, such as getting better sleep,
exercising (when you’re well enough to exercise), taking medications, and
using therapies such as acupuncture and other options.
Relaxing Will Cure What Ails You
When your symptoms from FMS are really bothering you, many people will
tell you that you’re working too hard, that you need to ease off. They may
advise you that a week on a cruise or a nice vacation to a pleasant place will
fix you right up. In fact, you may be working too hard right now, and stress
299
Chapter 24: Ten Myths about Fibromyalgia

certainly can exacerbate fibromyalgia. Maybe some rest and relaxation would
make you feel much better. But when you have fibromyalgia, a vacation can’t
cure you. You could win the lottery and retire tomorrow, and you’d still have
periodic flare-ups of the problem — although it beats working a day job at
the office with your FMS!
Taking Some Pills Should 
Fix You Right Up
Some people become annoyed when you tell them about your pain, and they
advise you to “take a pill,” whether it’s Tylenol, Aleve, or another medication.
Many people are very drug-oriented — they think that the right pill or combi-
nation of pills will solve just about any problem. This can be good in that
people are willing to take medications that can help them, and many medica-
tions are available to treat fibromyalgia. But thinking that swallowing a few
pills will completely resolve your problem is not a valid assumption.
Medications are short-term fixes for the long-term problem of fibromyalgia. 
(I discuss over-the-counter and prescription medications in Chapters 9 and
10 as well as in Appendix B.)
Ignoring the Problem Will
Make It Go Away
Your partner or your friends may tell you that you’re dwelling on your symp-
toms far too much. Distract yourself, think about something else, and you’ll
feel better. To a certain extent, if you’re able to distract yourself with interest-
ing work, hobbies, or family tasks, you may succeed at ignoring some pain.
But most of it will still be there, whether you ignore it or not.
Therapy Always Works
Some people think that the answer to any long-term problem is therapy, and
that a good therapist can help you work through all your problems. Although
a therapist can certainly help you if you have problems with anxiety, depres-
sion, or stress, that same therapist can’t cure your fibromyalgia. You prob-
ably will feel some better after talking to a therapist — but not all better.

Part VII
Appendixes

In this part . . .
T
he last part of this book includes appendixes. In
Appendix A, I offer you a glossary of terms, so you can
easily look up the definitions for key fibromyalgia-related
words.
In Appendix B, I provide a very helpful and up-to-date list
of medications, both over-the-counter and prescribed
drugs, which are often recommended to people with
fibromyalgia. You may know these medications by either
their brand name or their generic name, so I give you both,
along with the main side effects that these medications
may cause.
If you want to uncover even more information on
fibromyalgia after you’ve finished reading this book, check
out Appendix C. It lists organizations with helpful informa-
tion, publications that may intrigue you, and sources for
fibromyalgia-related info online.

Appendix A
Glossary
acupuncture: A form of treatment in which tin y needles are inserted into
muscle to stimulate the production of endorphins (natural painkilling bio-
chemicals). Several studies have supported acupuncture as an effective treat-
ment for fibromyalgia.
alternative medicine: Treatments or medications that may not have a scien-
tific explanation for their effectiveness. Alternative medicine includes the use
of vitamin, herbal, and mineral supplements; acupuncture; and homeopathy;
as well as other remedies and treatments.
anxiety disorders: Psychological problems often causing chronic distress,
including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and specific
phobia disorder. Individuals with fibromyalgia often suffer from one or more
anxiety disorders. Read about anxiety disorders in Chapter 6.
arthritis: An illness affecting the joints. Many people with osteoarthritis,
rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus have joint pain and inflammation. (For more
on arthritis, check out Arthritis For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Barry Fox,
Nadine Taylor, and Jinoos Yazdany [Wiley].)
Arthritis Foundation: A nonprofit organization providing information on
fibromyalgia and arthritis to consumers and medical professionals that has
funded clinical studies on fibromyalgia and arthritis. (For more information,
visit the Arthritis Foundation Web site at www.arthritis.org or call
800-568-4045 or 404-872-7100.)
benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHD): A common disorder of the
joints that causes hyperflexion/extension and often causes excessive pain. It
may be confused with fibromyalgia in some cases.
Botox injections: Injections of minute amounts of botulinum toxins into the
muscles and other areas of the body where patients feel pain. This treatment
is controversial, and its use in fibromyalgia is not approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA).

chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): A disorder in which symptoms are primar-
ily characterized by extreme exhaustion and pain. It is often confused with
fibromyalgia. (For more on CFS, check out Chronic Fatigue Syndrome For
Dummies, by Susan R. Lisman, MD, and Karla Dougherty [Wiley].)
cortisol: A stress-related hormone that has been found in abnormal levels in
many people who have fibromyalgia.
depression: A serious, chronic form of despair beyond the normal feelings of
sadness. Many people with fibromyalgia suffer from depression, but it’s
highly treatable.
dextromethorphan: A medication commonly used to treat coughs. Some
research has indicated that it may provide some pain relief in fibromyalgia.
electroconvulsive therapy: A treatment using electrical pulses to decrease
major depression. Studies have shown that such therapy may be effective for
fibromyalgia.
fibro fog: Mental confusion and forgetfulness that can accompany a flare-up
of fibromyalgia symptoms. Also known as brain fog. (Read about fibro fog in
Chapter 2.)
fibromyalgia: Chronic pain condition characterized by tender points, wide-
spread pain, fatigue, morning stiffness, sleep disturbances, and distress. See
also tender points.
guaifenesin: A medication commonly used to treat coughs, and also used by
some physicians to treat fibromyalgia. Studies have not validated this use.
(Read about guaifenesin in Chapter 9.)
Gulf War syndrome: A condition characterized by fatigue and widespread
pain and body aches related to active duty in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Some
Gulf War veterans have fibromyalgia and may be eligible for compensation
from the Veterans Administration.
headaches: Head pain related to muscle tension, migraine attacks, or a prob-
lem arising from the neck/cervical spine (as with cervicogenic headaches).
Many people with fibromyalgia have at least one type of chronic headache.
(For more on migraines, check out Migraines For Dummies, by Diane Stafford
and Jennifer Shoquist, MD [Wiley].)
heartburn: Chronic burning in the gut or chest that often results from gas-
troesophageal reflux. Stomach acid backs up into the esophagus and causes
pain. Many people with fibromyalgia have heartburn.
304
Part VII: Appendixes 

heating therapy: A form of treatment in which painful areas of the body are
stimulated with heat (such as a heating pad). Heating can be an effective
method of treating fibromyalgia.
hydrotherapy: A form of treatment that uses water to provide temporary
relief from the pain of fibromyalgia, such as pool walking and exercises per-
formed in the pool, as well as the use of whirlpool baths and hot tubs.
icing therapy: A form of treatment in which painful areas of the body are
stimulated with ice. Icing can be an effective method of treating fibromyalgia.
interstitial cystitis (IC): A chronic unspecific illness of pain with urination
and increased urgency. Some people with fibromyalgia may also have IC.
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): A chronic bowel condition often character-
ized by abdominal pain in conjunction with constipation and/or diarrhea.
Many people with fibromyalgia suffer from IBS. (For more on IBS, check out
IBS For Dummies, by Carolyn Dean, MD, ND, and L. Christine Wheeler, MA
[Wiley].)
Lyme disease: A bacterial illness spread by a deer tick that can cause severe
rashes, joint pain, and tiredness. Because of similar symptoms, Lyme disease
may be confused with fibromyalgia. A blood test confirms Lyme disease.
massage therapy: A form of treatment in which painful areas are gently
rubbed to help with relaxation and pain management. Massage therapy can
be very helpful in treating fibromyalgia.
mononucleosis: An infectious disease that can cause high fevers, sore throat,
and extreme lethargy that may be confused with fibromyalgia or chronic
fatigue syndrome. Mononucleosis can be diagnosed with a blood test.
multiple chemical sensitivities syndrome (MCSS): A condition in which the
person has become extremely sensitive to many environmental substances
that were never a problem before, such as odors, foods, and other common
items.
myofascial pain syndrome: A condition characterized by regional pain as
well as by focal muscle-tissue abnormalities (called trigger points) that the
doctor can identify upon touching them. In contrast, the tender points of
fibromyalgia are highly sensitive to touch but do not consist of abnormal 
tissues.
pain diary: A written daily record of when pain is most severe, which helps
patients and doctors track conditions that may trigger pain, such as activi-
ties, stress, or other items.
305
Appendix A: Glossary

painkillers: Over-the-counter or prescribed medications taken to reduce pain
from fibromyalgia. Narcotics are painkilling medications, as are non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
pain management: Techniques for reducing chronic pain to a tolerable level,
with medications, injections, massage therapy, physical therapy, and other
treatments.
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): A disorder arising from extreme
stress from abuse, injuries, war, or other distressing situations that may con-
tinue long after the distressing incident. People with PTSD may develop
fibromyalgia immediately after the incident (or sometime later). Similarly,
many patients with fibromyalgia have PTSD.
relaxation therapy: A technique that allows a person under stress to
decrease high physical and mental tension. Lowering high levels of stress
usually improves the symptoms of a person with fibromyalgia.
sleep disorders: Difficulty getting to sleep and/or staying asleep. Sleep disor-
ders are extremely common among people with fibromyalgia.
Social Security disability compensation: Monthly compensation and medical
insurance (Medicare) provided by the Social Security Administration (Web:
www.ssa.gov; phone: 800-772-1213) to eligible individuals who cannot work
because of fibromyalgia or other medical problems.
Substance P: A neurochemical whose levels have been shown to be three
times higher in the spinal fluid of patients with fibromyalgia compared to
pain-free individuals.
supplements: Minerals or herbs that may provide relief to people with
fibromyalgia. Some research has indicated that supplemental magnesium is
helpful to some patients with fibromyaglia.
tai chi: A Chinese exercise technique mimicking movements of animals. Most
people with fibromyalgia can tolerate performing these exercises.
tender points: Specific areas of the body that are painful when lightly
pressed if a person has fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia generally have
pain at 11 or more of the 18 tender points. (For a diagram, see Chapter 8.)
thyroid disease: Malfunction of the thyroid gland that results in either abnor-
mally high or low levels of circulating thyroid hormone. Symptoms of thyroid
disease may be confused with fibromyalgia and other illnesses. (For more on
thyroid disease, check out Thyroid For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Alan L.
Rubin, MD [Wiley].)
valerian: An herb used to induce sleep.

Fibromyalgia Medications
I
n this appendix, I provide listings of both prescribed and over-the-counter
medications that may be recommended to you and others with fibromyal-
gia syndrome (FMS). I include the following information:
 The brand name of the drug
 The generic name of the drug
 Primary side effects that may occur, although side effects aren’t 
experienced by everyone
Note: In a few cases, a drug’s brand name and generic name are the same, as
with guaifenesin and dextromethorphan.
I provide these listings for your information only. Don’t consider this informa-
tion to be any sort of a substitute for consulting with your own physician and
following his medical recommendations.
Pondering Prescribed Medications
Whether you have severe pain, fatigue, and/or sleep problems from your
fibromyalgia or just minor discomfort, at some point, you’ll need prescription
drugs to treat your FMS symptoms. You may need meds on a regular basis, or
you may need to take them only when symptoms flare up. Whatever your
needs, I provide information about different types of prescription medica-
tions prescribed for fibromyalgia.
Sometimes, anti-anxiety medications (see Table B-1) can help with the pain
generated by fibromyalgia as well as with sleep problems that many people
with FMS struggle with.

Reviewing Over-the-Counter Medications

fibromyalgia because they can help relieve pain and sleep problems. Of
course, just because a drug isn’t prescribed doesn’t mean it’s automatically
safe or will help you. Every medication has side effects to consider before
taking the drug.
Some physicians may recommend cold remedies (see Table B-9) to help alle-
viate some FMS symptoms.

Resources and Support
I
n this appendix, I provide you with lists of organizations and Internet
resources that may be of interest to people with fibromyalgia syndrome
(FMS), as well as to their family and friends and others, such as co-workers. I
don’t personally endorse any of these listings (nor does the publisher), and
I’m not responsible for their content, but I hope that you find them useful and
helpful.
Organizations
National and international organizations throughout the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom, and other countries provide a wealth of infor-
mation, educational materials, and morale-boosting offerings. Most of these
organizations also provide newsletters, brochures, and other publications.
(Some of the publications are free, and some items are available for a fee.)
Here’s a rundown on some key groups with an interest in fibromyalgia:

To find local support groups interested in fibromyalgia, ask your local refer-
ence librarian for help — not the librarian at the front desk, but the person
who works at the reference section of your library. (If you call the library, ask
for the reference desk.) Also, ask your doctors who treat fibromyalgia and
any friends or relatives who have fibromyalgia if they know of any local
groups. Local support-group meeting times may also be published in free
weekly newspapers that are often distributed to neighborhoods or available
at convenience stores.
Finding Information on the Internet
On the Internet, you can find a variety of places to gain information, share
what you know about fibromyalgia, and meet other people with similar inter-
ests. The key formats of these options are Web sites, e-mail lists, newsgroups,
and forums.
Spotting the frauds, scams, and just plain crazy ideas on the Internet isn’t
always easy — but it’s often possible. Keep a few basics in mind:
 Try to determine who’s running the Web site by locating the Contact
Us link or by looking on the main page. If you can’t find such a link and
no matter how hard you look, you can’t find a name, mailing address, or
a telephone number, alarm bells should ring. Those alarms are saying:
Don’t buy anything with your credit card from these people.
 Try to determine the primary purpose of this site. Is it an information-
only site, or are you bombarded with offers to buy this and that wonder
cure? If so, watch out. And speaking of wonder cures, if you’re offered a
quickie and forever cure, then run away. Sorry, but managing fibromyal-
gia just isn’t that easy.
If you’re still not sure whether you should buy a product that you’re told that
you need “RIGHT NOW!” try this: Imagine that the site was offering products
for another medical problem, one that you don’t have, such as diabetes or
asthma. Would the offers still seem credible? If not, you need to say goodbye.
Also, be sure to talk to your doctor about any products that you buy over the
Internet. Some products could be harmless, while others could interact dan-
gerously with your other medications.

Checking out Web sites
Hundreds of different Web sites on the Internet have either a direct or indi-
rect concentration on the subject of fibromyalgia. Some popular sites include
the following:
 American Fibromyalgia Syndrome Association, Inc.: www.afsafund.
org
 Arthritis Foundation: www.arthritis.org
 Fibrohugs Fibromyalgia Support Site: www.fibrohugs.com
 Fibromyalgia Network: www.fmnetnews.com

 National Fibromyalgia Association: www.fmaware.org
 National Fibromyalgia Research Association: www.nfra.net
 University of Florida Fibromyalgia Research Information: www.
med.ufl.edu/rheum/
Looking at e-mail lists
An e-mail list, also called a listserv, is an arrangement whereby you join as a
member and automatically receive all e-mails sent by every member.
(Sometimes, e-mail lists provide you the option of going to a special Web site
to read all the messages if you don’t want to receive a large number of
e-mails.)
Before joining an e-mail list, consider the pros and cons of doing so. Here are
some of the positive aspects of joining e-mail lists:
 You may gain information that’s difficult or impossible to obtain else-
where. Some posters (people who send e-mail to the list participants)
are medical professionals.
 You may feel a strong kinship to others who are going through prob-
lems that you are facing.
317
Appendix C: Resources and Support

As with almost everything in this world, e-mail lists also have a few strikes
against them:
 You must wade through a large number of responses. An active list can
generate many messages! My coauthor told me that she joined a listserv
once and received 100 messages the first day and even more the second
day! On the third day, she begged to be removed from the list because
she just couldn’t keep up. Not all listservs are overwhelmingly active,
but some are.
 People who post messages may act as if they are knowledgeable about
a topic, but they may know little or nothing about it.
Check out the following table for examples of e-mail lists.

Noting newsgroups
A newsgroup, also known as a Usenet group, is an online special-interest group
that usually doesn’t require you to subscribe, fill out any forms, or agree to
anything. You can read all the messages without ever making any public
comments or revealing your presence. Or you can post messages and read
replies. Some newsgroups are moderated by one or more people who set
rules and make sure participants obey them; if not, they’re warned and then
may be thrown off. Many groups, however, aren’t moderated, and it’s a free-for-
all kind of atmosphere. This can be good or bad, depending on your viewpoint.
Here are some of the good things you can gain from joining a newsgroup:
 Newsgroups often offer good or at least interesting information (as
long as you read everything skeptically).
 Newsgroups give most readers strong moral support.
 Posters offer direct Web links to useful journal articles that you’d
probably never find on your own.
318
Part VII: Appendixes 

When you find pros, you often find cons:
 Newsgroups are open to the world at large, and consequently, some
people write obscene and/or ridiculous and insulting messages. This
can cause considerable distress.
 Some individuals try to sell their own products, either overtly or
covertly.
 People who aren’t knowledgeable may offer cures or solutions that
don’t work or even exist.
Contact your Internet service provider (ISP) to determine how to reach news-
groups. You can also find links to many newsgroups (including alt.med.
fibromyalgia) at www.makoa.org/usenet.htm.
Following forums
An online forum is a place where people with a special interest can usually
find a great deal of information, read messages, and post their own messages.
Forums are also known as message boards, discussion boards, or bulletin
boards. At least one person usually moderates forums.
If you type fibromyalgia into your favorite search engine (such as Yahoo! or
Google), you’ll likely find too many listings to help you. Instead, try such sites
as www.fibrotalk.info and click on the subject links that fascinate you
the most. If you’re in Canada, go to http://fibromyalgia.ncf.ca.
Pondering Publications
As of this writing, several national newsletters or magazines are dedicated to
