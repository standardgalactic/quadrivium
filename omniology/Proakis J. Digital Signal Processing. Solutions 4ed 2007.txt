(a) One dimensional, multichannel, discrete time, and digital.
(b) Multi dimensional, single channel, continuous-time, analog.
(c) One dimensional, single channel, continuous-time, analog.
(d) One dimensional, single channel, continuous-time, analog.
(e) One dimensional, multichannel, discrete-time, digital.
1.2
(a) f = 0.01π
2π
=

7 ⇒periodic with Np = 7.
(c) f = 3π
2π = 3
2 ⇒periodic with Np = 2.
(d) f =

2π ⇒non-periodic.
(e) f = 62π
10 ( 1
2π) = 31
10 ⇒periodic with Np = 10.
1.3
(a) Periodic with period Tp = 2π
5 .
(b) f =

2π ⇒non-periodic.
(c) f =
1
12π ⇒non-periodic.
(d) cos( n
8 ) is non-periodic; cos( πn
8 ) is periodic; Their product is non-periodic.
(e) cos( πn
2 ) is periodic with period Np=4
sin( πn
8 ) is periodic with period Np=16
cos( πn
4 + π
3 ) is periodic with period Np=8
Therefore, x(n) is periodic with period Np=16. (16 is the least common multiple of 4,8,16).
1.4
(a) w = 2πk
N
implies that f = k
N . Let
α = GCD of (k, N), i.e.,
k = k′α, N = N ′α.
Then,
f = k′
N ′ , which implies that
N ′ = N
α .

(a)
x(n)
=
Acos(2πF0n/Fs + θ)
=
Acos(2π(T/Tp)n + θ)
But T/Tp = f ⇒x(n) is periodic if f is rational.
(b) If x(n) is periodic, then f=k/N where N is the period. Then,
Td = (k
f T) = k(Tp
T )T = kTp.
Thus, it takes k periods (kTp) of the analog signal to make 1 period (Td) of the discrete signal.
(c) Td = kTp ⇒NT = kTp ⇒f = k/N = T/Tp ⇒f is rational ⇒x(n) is periodic.

(a) True. If
v1(n) = T1[x1(n)] and
v2(n) = T1[x2(n)],
then
α1x1(n) + α2x2(n)
yields
α1v1(n) + α2v2(n)
by the linearity property of T1. Similarly, if
y1(n) = T2[v1(n)] and
y2(n) = T2[v2(n)],
then
β1v1(n) + β2v2(n) →y(n) = β1y1(n) + β2y2(n)
by the linearity property of T2. Since
v1(n) = T1[x1(n)] and

v2(n) = T2[x2(n)],
it follows that
A1x1(n) + A2x2(n)
yields the output
A1T [x1(n)] + A2T [x2(n)],
where T = T1T2. Hence T is linear.
(b) True. For T1, if
x(n) →v(n) and
x(n −k) →v(n −k),
For T2, if
v(n) →y(n)
andv(n −k) →y(n −k).
Hence, For T1T2, if
x(n) →y(n) and
x(n −k) →y(n −k)
Therefore, T = T1T2 is time invariant.
(c) True. T1 is causal ⇒v(n) depends only on x(k) for k ≤n. T2 is causal ⇒y(n) depends only on v(k) for k ≤
n. Therefore, y(n) depends only on x(k) for k ≤n. Hence, T is causal.
(d) True. Combine (a) and (b).
(e) True. This follows from h1(n) ∗h2(n) = h2(n) ∗h1(n)
(f) False. For example, consider
T1 : y(n) = nx(n) and
T2 : y(n) = nx(n + 1).
Then,
T2[T1[δ(n)]]
=
T2(0) = 0.
T1[T2[δ(n)]]
=
T1[δ(n + 1)]
=
−δ(n + 1)
̸=
0.
(g) False. For example, consider
T1 : y(n) = x(n) + b and
T2 : y(n) = x(n) −b, where b ̸= 0.
Then,
T [x(n)] = T2[T1[x(n)]] = T2[x(n) + b] = x(n).
Hence T is linear.
(h) True.
T1 is stable ⇒v(n) is bounded if x(n) is bounded.
T2 is stable ⇒y(n) is bounded if v(n) is bounded .

Hence, y(n) is bounded if x(n) is bounded ⇒T = T1T2 is stable.
(i) Inverse of (c). T1 and for T2 are noncausal ⇒T is noncausal. Example:
T1 : y(n)
=
x(n + 1) and
T2 : y(n)
=
x(n −2)
⇒T : y(n)
=
x(n −1),
which is causal. Hence, the inverse of (c) is false.
Inverse of (h): T1 and/or T2 is unstable, implies T is unstable. Example:
T1 : y(n) = ex(n), stable and T2 : y(n) = ln[x(n)], which is unstable.
But T : y(n) = x(n), which is stable. Hence, the inverse of (h) is false.

The system is nonlinear. This is evident from observation of the pairs
x3(n) ↔y3(n) and x2(n) ↔y2(n).
If the system were linear, y2(n) would be of the form
y2(n) = {3, 6, 3}
because the system is time-invariant. However, this is not the case.

x1(n) + x2(n) = δ(n)

We can express the unit sample in terms of the unit step function as δ(n) = u(n) −u(n −1).
Then,
h(n)
=
h(n) ∗δ(n)
=
h(n) ∗(u(n) −u(n −1)
=
h(n) ∗u(n) −h(n) ∗u(n −1)
=
s(n) −s(n −1)
Using this deﬁnition of h(n)
y(n)
=
h(n) ∗x(n)
=
(s(n) −s(n −1)) ∗x(n)
=
s(n) ∗x(n) −s(n −1) ∗x(n)
2.24
If
y1(n)
=
ny1(n −1) + x1(n) and
y2(n)
=
ny2(n −1) + x2(n) then
x(n)
=
ax1(n) + bx2(n)
produces the output
y(n) = ny(n −1) + x(n), where
y(n) = ay1(n) + by2(n).
Hence, the system is linear. If the input is x(n −1), we have
y(n −1)
=
(n −1)y(n −2) + x(n −1). But
y(n −1)
=
ny(n −2) + x(n −1).
Hence, the system is time variant. If x(n) = u(n), then |x(n)| ≤1. But for this bounded input,
the output is
y(0) = 1,
y(1) = 1 + 1 = 2,
y(2) = 2x2 + 1 = 5, . . .
which is unbounded. Hence, the system is unstable.

Hence,

The particular solution to
x(n) = 2nu(n) is
yp(n) = k(2n)u(n).
Substitute this solution into the diﬀerence equation. Then, we obtain
k(2n)u(n) −k(5

For n = 2,

y(n) −3y(n −1) −4y(n −2) = x(n) + 2x(n −1)
The characteristic equation is
λ2 −3λ −4 = 0.
Hence, λ = 4, −1 and
yh(n) = c1(n)4n + c2(−1)n.
Since 4 is a characteristic root and the excitation is
x(n) = 4nu(n),
we assume a particular solution of the form
yp(n) = kn4nu(n).
Then
kn4nu(n) −3k(n −1)4n−1u(n −1) −4k(n −2)4n−2u(n −2)

To solve for c1 and c2, we assume that y(−1) = y(−2) = 0. Then,

Hence,
c1 + c2 = 1 and

From 2.30, the characteristic values are λ = 4, −1. Hence
yh(n) = c14n + c2(−1)n
When x(n) = δ(N), we ﬁnd that
y(0) = 1 and
y(1) −3y(0) = 2 or
y(1) = 5.

The range of non-zero values of γxx(l) is determined by
n0 −N ≤n ≤n0 + N
n0 −N ≤n −l ≤n0 + N
which implies
−2N ≤l ≤2N
For a given shift l, the number of terms in the summation for which both x(n) and x(n −l) are
non-zero is 2N + 1 −|l|, and the value of each term is 1. Hence,

(b) γxx(l) has peaks at l = 0, ±k1, ±k2 and ±(k1 + k2). Suppose that k1 < k2. Then, we can
determine γ1 and k1. The problem is to determine γ2 and k2 from the other peaks.
(c) If γ2 = 0, the peaks occur at l = 0 and l = ±k1. Then, it is easy to obtain γ1 and k1.

The term P−1
n=n0 xr(n)z−n converges for all z except z = ∞.
The term P∞
n=0 xr(n)z−n converges for all |z| > r0 where some r0. Hence Xr(z) converges for
r0 < |z| < ∞when n0 < 0 and |z| > r0 for n0 > 0

The ﬁrst term converges for some |z| < rl. The second term converges for all z, except z = 0.
Hence, Xl(z) converges for 0 < |z| < rl when n0 > 0, and for |z| < rl when n0 < 0.

Assume that the polynomial has real coeﬃcients and a complex root and prove that the complex
conjugate of the root will also be a root. Hence, let p(z) be a polynomial and z1 is a complex
root. Then,
anzn
1 + an−1zn−1
1
+ . . . + a1z1 + a0 = 0
(1)
The complex conjugate of (1) is
an(z∗
1)n + an−1(z∗
1)n−1 + . . . + a1(z∗
1) + a0 = 0
Therefore, z∗
1 is also a root.

If we substitute z−1 for z and multiply both sides by z−(N−1) we obtain
z−(N−1)X(z−1) = X(z)
Hence, X(z) and X(z−1) have identical roots. This means that if z1 is root (or a zero) of X(z)
then

z1 is also a root. Since x(n) is real, then z∗

From the deﬁnition of the Fibonacci sequence, y(n) = y(n −1) + y(n −2), y(0) = 1. This is
equivalent to a system described by the diﬀerence equation y(n) = y(n −1) + y(n −2) + x(n),

If h(n) is real, even and has a ﬁnite duration 2N + 1, then (with M = 2N + 1)
H(z)
=
h(0) + h(1)z−1 + h(2)z−2 + . . . + h(M −1)z−(M−1)/2
since h(n)
=
h(M −n −1), then
H(z)
=
z−(M−1)/2(h(0)
h
z(M−1)/2 + z−(M−1)/2i
+h(1)
h
z(M−3)/2 + z−(M−3)/2i
+ . . . + h(M −1/2))
with M = 2N + 1, the expression becomes

H(z1)
=
z−N


h(N) + P(z1) + P(z−1

= 0
Then, h(N) + P(z1) + P(z−1

=
0.
This implies that H( 1

h(N) + P(z−1

=

(1) The system can be causal; (2) The system can be anti-causal; (3) There are two other
noncausal responses.The corresponding ROC for each of these possibilities are :
ROC1 : |z| > 3;
ROC2 : |z| < 3;
ROC3 : 1

Hence X(z) can be associated wih a causal

The answer is no. For the given system h1(n) = anu(n) ⇒H1(z) =
1
1−az−1 , |a| < 1. This system
is causal and stable. However when h2(n) = anu(n + 3) ⇒H2(z) =
a−3z3
1−az−1 the system is stable
but is not causal.

Initial value theorem for anticausal signals: If x(n) is anticausal, then x(0) = limz→0X(z)
Proof: X(z) = P0
n=−∞x(n)z−n = x(0) + x(−1)z + x(−2)z2 + . . . Then limz→0X(z) = x(0)

Chapter 5
5.1
(a) Because the range of n is (−∞, ∞), the fourier transforms of x(n) and y(n) do not exist.
However, the relationship implied by the forms of x(n) and y(n) is y(n) = x3(n). In this case,
the system H1 is non-linear.
(b) In this case,
X(w)
=
1
1 −1
2e−jw ,
Y (w)
=
1
1 −1
8e−jw ,
Hence, H(w)
=
Y (w)
X(w)
=
1 −1
2e−jw
1 −1
8e−jw
⇒
System is LTI
Note however that the system may also be nonlinear, e.g., y(n) = x3(n).
(c) and (d).
Clearly, there is an LTI system that produces y(n) when excited by x(n), e.g.
H(w) = 3, for all w, or H( π
5 ) = 3.
(e) If this system is LTI, the period of the output signal would be the same as the period of the
input signal, i.e., N1 = N2. Since this is not the case, the system is nonlinear.

(c) Since the impulse response is complex, a real input signal produces a complex-valued output
signal. For the output to be real, the bandpass ﬁlter should have a complex conjugate pole.

h(n) = b0δ(n) + b1δ(n −D) + b2δ(n −2D) (a) If the input to the system is x(n), the output is
y(n) = b0x(n)+b1x(n−D)+b2x(n−2D). Hence, the output consists of x(n), which is the input
signal, and the delayed signals x(n −D) and x(n −2D). The latter may be thought of as echoes

condition is y(n) = (−1)nx(n). The proof that y(n) is minimum phase proceeds as follows:
Y (z)
=
X
n
y(n)z−n
=
X
n
(−1)nx(n)z−n
=
X
n
x(n)(−z−1)n
=
X(−z)
This preserves the minimum phase property since a factor (1 −αz−1) →(1 + αz−1)

Consider the system with real and even impulse response h(n) =
 1
4, 1, 1

and frequency response
H(w) = 1 + 1
2cosw. Then H(z) = z−1( 1
4z2 + z + 1
4). The system has zeros at z = −2 ±
√
3.
We observe that the system is stable, and its frequency response is real and even. However, the
inverse system is unstable. Therefore, the stability of the inverse system is not guaranteed.

(a) Correct. The zeros of the resulting system are the combination of the zeros of the two systems.
Hence, the resulting system is minimum phase if the inividual system are minimum phase.
(b) Incorrect. For example, consider the two minimum-phase systems.

and H2(z)

(c) Refer to ﬁg 6.23-3. The ﬁrst order hold interpolator performs better than the zero order
interpolator because the frequency response of the ﬁrst order hold is more closer to the ideal
interpolator than that of the zero order hold case.
(d) Refer to ﬁg 6.23-4.
(e) Refer to ﬁg 6.23-5. Higher order interpolators with more memory or cubic spline interpolators
would be a better choice.

Generally, single precision means a 32-bit length or δ = 5x10−10; while 4 signiﬁcant digits means
δ = 5x10−5. Thus the error in the ﬁnal results would be 105 times larger.
(c) Since the error grows as lδ, after N iterations we have an error of Nδ. If W ql
N is reset to -j
after every ql = N
4 iterations, the error at the last step of the iteration is lδ =

error reduced by approximately a factor 4q.

Refer to Fig.8.1.9. The ﬁrst stage of butterﬂies produces (2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0). The twiddle
factor multiplications do not change this sequence. The nex stage produces (4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0) which again remains unchanged by the twiddle factors. The last stage produces (8, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0). The bit reversal to permute the sequence into proper order unscrambles only zeros so
the result remains (8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).

The ﬁrst term can be obtained from an N
2 -point DFT without any additional multiplications.
Hence, we use a radix-2 FFT. For the second term, we use a radix-4 FFT. Thus, for N=8, the
DFT is decomposed into a 4-point, radix-2 DFT and a 4-point radix-4 DFT. The latter is

In general, the IDFT of an N-length sequence can be obtained by reversing the ﬂow of a forward
FFT and introducing a scale factor
1
N . Since the IDFT is apparently capable of producing the
(scaled) DFT for a Hermitian symmetric sequence, the reversed ﬂow FFT will produce the desired
FFT.

(a) 11 frequency points must be calculated. Radix-2 FFT requires 1024
2 log21024 ≈5000 complex
multiplies or 20,000 real multiplies.
FFT of radix-4 requires 0.75 × 5000 = 3, 750 complex
multiplies or 15,000 real multiplies. Choose Goertzel.
(b) In this case, direct evaluation requires 106 complex multiplies, chirp-z 22 × 103 comples
multiplies, and FFT 1000 + 5000
2

In the DIF case, the number of butterﬂies aﬀecting a given output is N

the second, . . .. The total number is

Every butterﬂy requires 4 real multiplies, and the eror variance is δ2
12. Under the assumption that
the errors are uncorrelated, the variance of the total output quantization error is
σ2
q = 4(N −1) δ2

since |Xn(k)| < 1

since |Xl(k)| < 1
2,
|Re[W m
N Xn(l)]|
<

so |Re[W m
N Xn(l)]|
<
1
2
Therefore |Re[Xn+1(k)]|
≤
|Re[Xn(k)]| + |Re[W m
N Xn(l)]| < 1
The other inequalities are veriﬁed similarly. (b)
Xn+1(k)
=
Re[Xn(k)] + jIm[Xn(k)]
[cos(2π
N m) −jsin(2π
N m)][Re[Xn(l)] + jIm[Xn(l)]]
=
Re[Xn(k)] + cos(.)Re[Xn(l)] + sin(.)Im[Xn(l)]
+j {Im[Xn(k)] + cos(.)Im[Xn(l)] + sin(.)Re[Xn(l)]}
Therefore, |Xn+1(k)|
=
|Xn(k)| + |Xn(l)| + A
where A
△=
2cos(.) {Re[Xn(k)]Re[Xn(l)] + Im[Xn(k)]Im[Xn(l)]}
+2sin(.) {Re[Xn(k)]Im[Xn(l)] −Im[Xn(k)]Re[Xn(l)]}
also |Xn+1(l)|2
=
|Xn(k)|2 + |Xn(l)|2 −A(∗)
Therefore, if A ≥0,
max[|Xn+1(k)|, |Xn+1(l)|]
=
|Xn+1(k)|
=

|Xn(k)|2 + |Xn(l)|2 + A
	 1
2
>
max[|Xn(k)|, |Xn(l)|]
By similar means using (*), it can be shown that the same inequality holds if A < 0. Also,
from the pair of equations fro computing the butterﬂy outputs, we have
2Xn(k)
=
Xn+1(k) + Xn+1(l)
2Xn(l)
=
W −m
N
Xn+1(k) −W −m
N
Xn+1(l)
By a similar method to that employed above, it can be shown that
2max[|Xn(k)|, |Xn(l)|] ≥max[|Xn+1(k)|, |Xn+1(l)|]

Figure 9.28-2: Structure of H(z) = b0z−3 + b0b1z−2 + b0b1b2z−1 + b0b1b2b3
H(z) = z2a3 + za2 + a1 + z−1a0 + z−2a1 + z−3a2 + z−4a3
By applying Horner’s scheme, we can rewrite this as
H(z) = z3(a3 + z−1(a2 + z−1(a1 + z−1(a0 + z−1(a1 + z−1(a2 + z−1a3))))))
Assuming that z−1 and z are given, a direct evaluation of H(z) at z = z0 requires 8 multiplications
and 6 additions. Using Horner’s scheme based on 9.28, requires the same number of operations
as direct evaluation of H(z). Hence, Horner’s scheme does not oﬀer any savings in computation.

With a Hamming window, we obtain the following frequency response: Refer to ﬁg 10.9-1.

H(s) has two zeros at z1 = −0.1 and z2 = ∞and two poles p1,2 = −0.1 ± j3. The matched
z-transform maps these into:
˜z1
=
e−0.1T = e−0.01 = 0.99
˜z2
=
e−∞T = 0
˜p1
=
e(−0.1+j3)T = 0.99ej0.3

Hence, H(z)

Figure 10.28-3:
With δ(n) as the input to H(z), we obtain the output
h(n) = −a1h(n −1) + b0δ(n).
For n > M = 1, we have
h(n) = −a1h(n −1)
or, equivalently,
hd(n) = −a1hd(n −1).
Substituting for hd(n), we obtain a1 = −1
2. To solve for b0, we use the equation given in 10.29(a)
with h(n) = hd(n),
hd(n) = 1
2hd(n −1) + b0δ(n).
For n = 0 this equation yields b0 = 2. Thus

response for each case together with the desired response is shown in Fig. 10.32-2. The frequency
response characteristics illustrate that Shanks’ method yields very good designs when the number
of poles and zeros equals or exceeds the number of poles and zeros in the actual ﬁlter. Thus the
inclusion of zeros in the approximation has a signiﬁcant eﬀect in the resulting design.

As long as Dw′
m ≤π, X(w′) [hence x(n)] can be recovered from X′′(w′′)[x′′(n) = x(Dn)]
using interpolation by a factor D:
X(w′) = DX′′(Dw′)

(b) Let xa(t) be the ral analog signal from which samples x(n) were taken at rate Fx. There exists
a signal, say x′
a(t′), such that x′
a(t′) = Xa( t
Tx ). x(n) may be considered to be the samples of x′(t′)
taken at rate fx = 1. Likewise x′′(n) = x(nD) are samples of x′(t′) taken at rate f ′′
x = fx
D = 1
D.
From sampling theory, we know that x′(t′) can be reconstructed from its samples x′′(n) as long
as it is bandlimited to fm ≤
1
2D, or wm ≤π
D, which is the case here. The reconstruction formula
is
x′(t′) =
X
k
x′′(k)hr(t′ −kD)
where
hr(t′) = sin( π
Dt′)
( π
Dt′)
Refer to ﬁg 11.4-2
Actually the bandwidth of the reconstruction ﬁlter may be made as small as w′
m, or as large
as 2π
D −w′
m, so hr may be
hr(t′) = sin(w′
ct′)
(w′ct′)
where w′
m ≤w′

b+(n) is nonzero for 0 ≤n ≤2N −2 with N even. Let c(n) = b+[n−(N −1)]. So c(n) is nonzero

Let y(m) = x(2n −p −m). Then, the backward prediction of x(n −p) becomes the forward
prediction of y(n). Hence, its linear prediction error ﬁlter is just the noise whitening ﬁlter of the

Hence, A3(z)

First, we determine the reﬂection coeﬃcients. Clearly, k3 = −1, whcih implies that the roots
of A3(z) are on the unit circle. We may factor out one root. Thus,
A3(z)
=
(1 −z−1)(1 −1

Ap(z) = Ap−1(z) + kpBp−1(z)z−1
where Bp−1(z) is the reverse polynomial of Ap−1(z).
For |kp| < 1, we have all the roots inside the unit circle as previously shown.
For |kp| = 1, Ap(z) is symmetric, which implies that all the roots are on the unit circle.
For |kp| > 1, Ap(z) = As(z) + ǫBp−1(z)z−1, where As(z) is the symmetric polynomial with all
the roots on the unit circle and Bp−1(z) has all the roots outside the unit circle. Therefore, Ap(z)
will have all its roots outside the unit circle.

We can either formally invert this z-transform, or use the following idea: The inverse z-
transform of 12.1 will have the form
γss(m) = γss(0)(0.8)|m|
From the AR model for s(n) it is easy to show
γss(0)
=
0.8γss(1) + γsv(0)
=
0.8γss(1) + δ2
and γss(1)
=
0.8γss(0) + γsv(1)
=
0.8γss(0)
solve for γss(0)
=
49
36
so γss(m)
=
49
36(4
5)|m|
Now γss(m)
=
E[x(n)x(n −m)]
=
E{[s(n) + w(n)][s(n −m) + w(n −m)]}
=
γss(m) + σ2

Since Rm is Hermitian, it assumes the decomposition Rm = UΛU H, where Λ is a diagonal matrix
with elements λk, 0 ≤k ≤m −1, the eigenvalues of Rm, and U is a normalized modal matrix
such that UU H = I.
Thus,

We can reduce the number of computations needed by m −1 multiplications if we avoid the
update of the Kalman gain
Km−1(n) = xCm−1(n) −ybm−1(n −1).
If we use the alternative Kalman gain this step takes the form
˜Km−1(n) = ˜Cm−1(n) −ybm−1(n −1).
As in the a-priori case, the update of the alternative Kalman gain vector ˜Km(n), is carried out
in two steps,
˜Km(n)
step−up
−→
˜Km+1(n + 1)
step−down

where {Hk(n)} are the ﬁlter coeﬃcients at t = nT. If e(n) = d −ˆd(n) then, an algorithm

We observe that |Hk(f)| = 0 at the frequencies f = n/M, n ̸= k and |Hk(f)| = 1 at
f = k/M.
Thus, the kth system has a resonant frequency at f = k/M, and it is zero at the resonant
frequencies of all the other systems. This means that if the desired signal is
d(n) =

the coeﬃcient of each single-pole ﬁlter can be adjusted independently without any interac-
tion from the other ﬁlters.

of h was set to 0. In Fig. 13.14-2 we have plotted J(h(n)) vs. h(n). As it is observed from
the ﬁgures the minimum value of J which is −372, is reached within 5 iterations of the
algorithm.

The optimum linear predictor in Prob. 13.16 is a ﬁrst order ﬁlter with transfer function
A(z) = 1 −az−1.
Thus, the corresponding lattice has one stage with the forward and backward errors given by
f(n) = f0(n) + Kb0(n −1)
b(n) = b0(n −1) + Kf0(n)
Since f0(n) = b0(n) = x(n), we obtain
f(n) = x(n) + Kx(n −1)
b(n) = x(n −1) + Kx(n).
Comparing with the prediction error:
e(n) = x(n) −ax(n −1)
we identify K as −a.

(a) (1) Divide x(n) into subsequences of length M
2 and overlapped by 50% to produce 4k subse-
quences. Each subsequence is padded with M
2 zeros.
(2) Compute the M-point DFT of each frame or subsequence.
(3) Compute the magnitude square of each DFT.
(4) Average the 4k M-point DFT’s.
(5) Perform the IDFT to obtain an estimate of the autocorrelation sequence.

subsequence and thus reduce the number of sequences form 4k to 2k. Then, we use the relation

(a) Obviously, △f = 0.01. From (12.2.52), M = 0.9
△f = 90.
(b) From (14.2.53), the quality factor is QB = 1.1N△f. This expression does not depend on M;
hence, there is no advantage to increasing the value of M beyond 90.

To prove the recursive relation in (12.3.19) we make use of the following relations:
ˆEm
=
N−1
X
n=m
[|fm(n)|2 + |gm(n −1)|2]
(1)
where fm(n)
=
fm−1(n) + kmgm−1(n −1)
gm(n)
=
ˆk∗
mfm−1(n) + gm−1(n −1)
(2)
and ˆEm−1
=
N−1
X
n=m−1
[|fm−1(n)|2 + |gm−1(n −1)|2]
=
|fm−1(m −1)|2 + |gm−1(m −2)|2
+
N−1
X
n=m
[|fm−1(n)|2 + |gm−1(n −1)|2]
Also,
N−1
X
n=m
[fm−1(n) + g∗
m−1(n −1)]
=
−1
2
ˆkm ˆEm−1
We substitute for fm(n) and gm(n −1) from (2) into (1), and we expand the expressions. Then,
use the relations for ˆEm−1 and ˆkm to reduce the result.

E[x(n)]

since E[w(n)]
=

ε(h) = hHΓxxh + µ(1 −EH(f)h) + µ∗(1 −hHE(f))
(a) To determine the optimum ﬁlter that minimizes σ2
y subject to the constraint, we diﬀerentiate
ε(h) with respect to hH (compute the complex gradient):
ε(h)
hH = Γxxh −µ∗E(f) = 0
Thus,

The frequency is found from the equation 1 + z−2 = 0 ⇒z = ±j. Therefore, ejw = ±j yields
w = ±π/2 and the power is P = 2.

By computing the denominator of (14.5.28), we ﬁnd that the frequency is ω = π/2 or f = 1/4. We
may also ﬁnd the frequency by using the eigenvectors v2 and v3 to construct the two polynomials
(Boot Music Method):

√
2z−2
V3(z)
=

Then, we form the polynomials
V2(z)V ∗
2 (1/z∗) + V3(z)V ∗
3 (1/z∗) = 1
3z2 + 2
3jz + 2 −2
3jz−1 + 1
3z−2
It is easily veriﬁed that the polynomial has a double root at z = j or, equivalently, at ω = π/2.
The other two roots are spurious roots that are neglected.
Finally, the power of the exponential signal is P1 = 1.

(b) For the roots of Q(z), we consruct (from Problem 14.34) Q(z) as
Q(z)

3 (1/z∗)

Thus polynomial has a double root at z = j and two spurious roots. Therefore, the desired
frequency is ω = π/2.
