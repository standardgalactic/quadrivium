About the Author
Alexander Hiam’s career integrates business and creativity in unusual ways. 
His work has included business strategy, high-tech entrepreneurship, new-
product development, branding, naming, negotiating, and consulting — often 
in the role of innovator or generator of new ideas and approaches.
He’s also taught thousands of managers innovation and creativity skills 
through his workshops and idea-generation retreats, as well as through 
his authorship of study materials such as The Manager’s Pocket Guide to 
Creativity (HRD Press), Creativity By Design (HRD Press), Creative Roles 
Analysis (Trainer’s Spectrum), and The Entrepreneur’s Complete Sourcebook 
(Simon & Schuster).
Alex’s professional focus on business innovation and how to lead it is 
balanced by his interest in the arts. He shows paintings, collages, and photo-
graphs and writes fi ction — his favorite being fantasy adventures for young 
adults. In this book, he harnesses his creative imagination to the task of 
helping others be more creative and successful in their businesses, whatever 
those might be.
Alex’s clients include the U.S. Coast Guard (he helps keep its leadership training 
innovative and at the forefront of management practice) and a lengthy list of 
companies, government agencies, nonprofi t boards, and more. He’s helped 
the U.S. Senate work on its collaborative problem-solving skills and brought 
new assessment tools to the fi nance department of the City of New York. His 
creativity exercises are used by top ad agencies to help their staff be more 
open to fresh ideas, and he shares his enthusiasm for innovative branding 
with students at the Isenberg School of Management at the University of 
Massachusetts–Amherst. Alex likes to help others achieve their creative 
potential and fi nd fresh options and solutions.
Alex’s other For Dummies books address his fascination with innovative 
approaches to marketing. He is the author of Marketing For Dummies, 3rd 
Edition, and Marketing Kit For Dummies, 3rd Edition (both from Wiley).


Dedication
My wife, Deirdre Richardson, suffered through lengthy writing sessions for 
nearly a year, and still managed to maintain a positive, encouraging attitude 
about this book — thereby serving as a perfect role model for what it takes to 
support a creative process from beginning to successful end!
Author’s Acknowledgments
I have lots of exciting ideas, but sometimes I need a little help disciplining 
them into proper shape for implementation. That’s why I’m so appreciative of 
the fi ne editorial team at Wiley that worked on this book with me, including 
acquisitions editor Stacy Kennedy, project editor Elizabeth Rea, copy editors 
Christine Pingleton and Kathy Simpson, and technical reviewer Lisa Gundry. It 
takes a team to do anything worthwhile. It helps when it’s a really good team!
I also want to thank my associates and clients at Trainer’s Spectrum, who 
provide me so many great suggestions and also, on occasion, the honest 
feedback that helps get the wrinkles out of my thinking.

Introduction
I
nnovation means so many things: new-product development, new brands, 
new ad campaigns, new Web sites, new production processes, new 
designs, new strategies, new solutions to persistent problems, and a great 
deal more.
Truth is, you need to innovate to succeed in your working life. The creative, 
forward-thinking people are the ones who make their mark and get ahead. It’s 
often risky to try new things or propose new approaches, but it’s even more 
risky to play it safe and close your mind to creative change. If you don’t take 
the lead as an innovator in your workplace and your field, you can be quite 
sure that somebody else will.
Businesses need to innovate too — and by businesses, I mean any orga-
nizations where people work, including startups, small businesses, big 
businesses, government offices and agencies, schools, hospitals, theaters, 
museums, temples, and churches.
My work has brought me into all these workplaces and many more. It’s so 
rewarding to help people create their own, better futures by teaching and 
facilitating the challenging process of innovation. It’s the most fun work I’ve 
ever done, except, I suppose, when I’m the innovator myself and am creating 
a new product, building a new business, or producing something innovative 
just for pleasure (such as a new art exhibit). Without innovation, work would 
be a dull, thankless routine. With it, there’s a reason to get up and rush to 
work each morning. Innovation gives us energy, and it gives energy to our 
workplaces as well, allowing them to grow and prosper instead of stagnate 
and fail.
About This Book
There’s a great need for innovators. In fact, that’s really all we need right 
now. People who resist change and don’t want to discuss new options and 
ideas are of no use to the world today, if they ever were. We humans are the 
innovators. Innovation is what separates us from all other life forms on this 
planet, and what creates the social and economic growth that we need to 
nurture to prevent future economic meltdowns.

2
Business Innovation For Dummies 
Your career, wherever it may be today, will accelerate if you pay more atten-
tion to how you contribute ideas, manage their development, and spearhead 
their implementation. Whether you work as a lone inventor, an enthusiastic 
entrepreneur, or a salaried staffer who insists on finding the time to contribute 
to new initiatives, your innovativeness stimulates your own career and contrib-
utes to the healthy growth of the organizations and people surrounding you.
In working with tens of thousands of employees all across North America, 
I’ve found that many of us working stiffs already know the basics of how to 
brainstorm ideas. Sure, I could show you many more advanced techniques, 
but I assume that you’ve already been exposed to the basics and feel con-
fident about how to brainstorm, either alone at your desk or with a small 
group in a conference room. But here’s the other statistic that I’ve gathered 
in my travels as an author, educator, and consultant: Basic brainstorming 
and its variants take place regularly in very few workplaces.
There you have the paradox of innovation in business: Everyone knows how 
to generate fresh new ideas, but nobody uses these techniques. As a conse-
quence, most decisions are made without anyone examining a full set of cre-
ative options. Many opportunities to innovate are lost, and usually nobody 
even realizes that an opportunity has passed by.
So you see, I have a personal agenda in writing Business Innovation For 
Dummies. I want to help you and others actually use the incredibly powerful 
tools and techniques of innovation. I want you to try being an active, practic-
ing innovator. Give it a try for the next week or two. If you like it, extend the 
experiment to a month. If that works for you, try being an innovator all year. 
I’m pretty darn sure you’ll get hooked for life, and your life will be far richer 
for it.
Conventions Used in This Book
When you’re reading this book, be aware of the following conventions:
 
✓ Whenever I introduce a new term, I italicize it.
 
✓ Any information that’s helpful or interesting but not essential appears 
in sidebars, which are the gray-shaded boxes sprinkled throughout 
the book.
 
✓ Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help them stand 
out. When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed 
to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I 
haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the 
break. When you use one of these Web addresses, just type exactly what 
you see in this book, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.

3
 Introduction
Additional conventions that you should be aware of are my uses of three 
terms that appear often in this book: innovation, creativity, and brainstorming.
 
✓ Innovation is applied creativity or creativity for a purpose. It involves 
creative generation of new ideas, designs, plans, and so on — and then 
it involves the development and refinement of those ideas and their 
implementation. Sometimes, innovators need to bring their inventions to 
market, putting on their sales hats to finish the process. At other times, 
the end user is within the innovator’s own organization. Still other situ-
ations may involve spreading an innovation to society to benefit public 
health or for some other worthy cause. Whatever the goal, innovation 
has a practical purpose that aims to create value by changing something 
in the real world, not just in the imagination.
 
✓ Creativity simply means coming up with fresh ideas, designs, or solu-
tions. It’s often the result of intuitive “aha” insights but also can come 
after careful analytical study of a topic. Artists are often creative, but 
not always. Businesses sometimes do creative things, but less often than 
artists do. Everyone working in business, however, can and should do 
some creative thinking every day. This book shows you how to weave 
more creativity into your work, and how to profit from the benefits of 
having fresh ideas and new perspectives to offer to your workplace and 
field or industry.
 
✓ Brainstorming refers to the broad range of structured techniques for 
idea generation. Alex Osborn, a cofounder of the giant advertising 
agency BBDO, coined that term back in the 1940s, and it’s become a 
generic term that almost everyone uses. It’s cumbersome to say idea-
generation techniques, so people say brainstorming instead. Osborn had a 
specific technique in mind when he first used the term, however, and if 
you want to follow his specific brainstorming rules, see Chapter 6.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you’re intelligent (not a foolish assumption, given what I know 
about my past readers). But although I believe that you’re intelligent, I 
assume that you don’t have all the technical knowledge, practical experience, 
and encouragement and support needed to come up with creative insights or 
innovate with success in your workplace. Everybody needs some help when 
it comes to innovation. You’ll find lots of helpful methods and ideas here.
I also assume that you’re able to adapt the techniques and examples in this 
book to your own situation. The methods I cover are very broadly applicable. 
Have faith that you can adapt them to almost any situation. Sometimes, it 
might take a little creativity, but I’m sure that you’re up to the challenge of 
making innovation happen wherever you are!

4
Business Innovation For Dummies 
Further, I assume that you’re willing and able to switch from being imagi-
native and creative one moment to being analytical and rigorous the next. 
Innovators need to take both perspectives, depending on the challenge at 
hand. Sometimes, you need to compare options and reject the weakest. At 
other times, you need to suspend judgment and open yourself to fresh ideas 
and possibilities. Knowing when to be open and when to be tough is part of 
the art of being an innovator. Try to be aware of which role you’re taking at 
any particular moment so that you can switch from creative to critical think-
ing as each situation requires.
Finally, I assume that you’ll not only work on your own creativity and innova-
tion skills, but also will encourage others. It takes lots of people to make the 
world a better place.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized in parts that I describe in the following sections. 
Check out the table of contents for more information on the topics of the 
chapters within each part.
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator
The expression “to make your mark” is interesting because it suggests two 
different things. Making a mark means making an impact or a difference by 
doing something that other people remember and appreciate. Also, your 
mark means your personal stamp or brand, so making your mark means 
more than just making a difference; it also means being remembered or 
known personally for what you do.
In Part I, I show you how to apply your creative energy in ways that benefit 
both your organization or workplace as a whole and you as an individual 
pursuing your own career. Whatever your line of work, the chapters in this 
part help you bring more reactive energy and innovation to what you do on 
a daily basis so that you open your career options and see more and better 
possibilities for yourself. I show you how to step up as a leader of innovation 
before diving into the specifics of bringing the power of innovation to sales, 
marketing, and strategic planning.
There are many ways to make your mark as an innovator. I can’t wait to see 
what you’ll do next!

 Introduction
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: 
Thinking in New and Different Ways
Innovation has to start with a novel idea. People with better ideas rise to the 
top, floating their organizations and associates up along with them. That’s 
the force of a strong creative idea, and to generate more of them when and 
where they’ll do the most good, read this part with care!
Part II is an essential primer on how to run a productive, effective idea-
generating session, as well as a deep toolbox full of powerful creativity 
techniques. It also focuses on ways to turn a specific problem or crisis into 
a great opportunity for forward progress and innovation, because problems 
are often perfect opportunities for introducing modest proposals based on 
your radically new ideas.
Also in this part, I share one of the secrets of successful innovators: You can 
often find existing innovations and bring them into your workplace or prod-
uct line without the full cost and trouble of developing them from scratch. 
These found innovations are extremely important in the business world, and 
this book is the only one I know of that addresses them. Finally, I really let 
the cat out of the bag by sharing an even deeper secret of top innovators: 
You can create breakthroughs by combining two or more good existing ideas 
or designs. Inventing something entirely new would be nice, but it’s actu-
ally amazingly difficult. More often in business, innovations are the result of 
clever combinations of other people’s breakthroughs, with just enough origi-
nality to make them unique.
Part III: Applying Creativity and 
Innovation to Daily Challenges
Innovators often focus on really big goals: develop a best-selling new prod-
uct, patent a winning new design, or create a new business model that pro-
duces runaway profits. Major breakthroughs are great, but they don’t come 
along every day. What should you do in the interim to keep your creative 
edge and continue to make your mark in small but significant ways?
This part helps you apply innovative thinking and methods to some of the 
common challenges of daily work. I show you how to create compelling, 
memorable presentations and proposals that sway people’s minds. I also 
show you how to apply the power of innovation to conflict resolution and 
negotiations; the force of creative thinking can easily sway the outcome in 
new and better directions.

6
Business Innovation For Dummies 
Finally, I tackle an unpleasant but essential reality of business life: the need 
to find ways to cut costs. Budget cuts are usually performed with a very dull 
knife. I’d much rather equip you with a creative mind and an ability to turn 
budget problems into opportunities for improvement.
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation
Usually, you won’t be able to work alone as an innovator. It takes a team at 
the very least, and this part shows you how to form and run effective devel-
opment teams to bring your innovation to life. In Part IV, I dive into the art 
and science of spreading the word and getting people to trade their old ideas, 
habits, and shopping patterns for new ones. I also focus on the ownership 
of inventions, designs, and expressions of ideas — the so-called intellectual 
property that people continually sue about in courts around the world. You 
probably need to study intellectual-property laws and practices to be a savvy 
innovator, avoiding trouble and taking advantage of the many benefits and 
protections that the law affords.
Part V: The Part of Tens
I have so many exciting tips and ideas that I want to share with you, and 
this part contains 40 of them. Each pointer in the Part of Tens is a useful 
technique that didn’t find a home in one of the main chapters of the book 
but probably ought to find a home in your approach to building your career, 
managing the creative process, and implementing the innovations that will 
make your mark visible for all the world to see.

Where to Go from Here
The beauty of Business Innovation For Dummies is that you can skip to any 
part, chapter, or section, depending on your needs. You can certainly read 
the book from cover to cover, but you don’t have to.
If you’re about to plunge into a meeting or work session in which you really 
need some fresh ideas or insights, you might try making Part II your starting 
point. Flip through the chapters to find something you can try right away. 
There’s nothing quite as satisfying as a fresh list of 10 or 20 helpful ideas to 
get you going, and the chapters in Part II can certainly deliver that many, if 
not a great deal more.
If you’re thinking more broadly about your working life and how to pump it 
up with new energy and momentum, start with Chapter 1, and read as many 
of the chapters after it as you can. The book makes a good self-study work-
shop that will certainly change your approach to work if you give it half a 
chance.

Making Your Mark 
as an Innovator

In this part . . .
W
hat will people remember you for if you leave your 
current job next month? Will you leave a legacy 
behind? Will you leave something that people will name 
after you or hold up as an inspiration for those who follow? 
I hope so! It’s important to make your mark wherever you 
go by contributing not only your effort, but also your 
good ideas. This part helps you engage your work in 
creative, proactive ways by being a source of innovations 
of all sorts.
Whether it’s a marketing challenge, such as redesigning a 
brand’s logo and look, or a strategic challenge, such as 
deciding how to achieve greater success next year than 
last, your career is made up of your contributions as an 
innovator. Step up to a leadership role in innovations of 
all kinds. It’s rewarding to be part of the solutions to 
problems and one of the architects of the future!

Chapter 1
Taking an Innovative 
Approach to Work
In This Chapter
▶ Engaging your most powerful personal asset
▶ Providing yourself a place to imagine
▶ Introducing daily creative practices
▶ Broadening your experience
▶ Benefiting from creative mentors
▶ Leading and succeeding through your innovative initiative
C
reativity is often thought to be the exclusive province of artists. This 
misconception gets a lot of people in trouble. Unless you spend a por-
tion of every working day being creative and opening yourself to the possibil-
ity of innovation, you and your employer or business are going to be stuck in 
the past instead of creating the future!
As you open this book, you also need to open yourself to fresh ideas and 
curious questions. Innovation taps into the creative and intuitive side of your 
mind — the so-called right-brain activities that are essential to the arts and 
invention. But innovation in a business environment (and in government and 
nonprofit workplaces, too) needs more than creative thinking. It also requires 
you to enlist the enthusiastic support of others and to push ahead with plans 
that turn your ideas into reality.
Being creative in your work means bringing a special spark to it and recogniz-
ing that things are going to change — so why not be the one who dreams up 
and then spearheads innovations?
You can bring positive change to anything and everything, from products 
and work processes to customer complaints or resource shortages. Conflicts 
and disagreements are wonderful opportunities for innovation because they 
reveal the various limitations and tensions that are holding people back in 

12
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
your workplace. Also, any special project — whether it’s a major presentation, 
a new planning cycle, or a move to a new location — is a great opportunity 
to innovate. Whenever you face a new responsibility or problem, put on your 
innovation hat. This chapter shows you how.
Tapping Into Your Own Creative Force
I define creative force as the power to create that flows through all of us. 
This definition is important because it takes a stand on a pair of perennially 
controversial issues:
 
✓ Some people say that creativity is a rare skill, but in my experience, we 
all can (and should!) be creative in our approach to our working lives. 
Creativity may come a little more naturally to some than others, but 
trust me on this: You will benefit substantially from nurturing your 
creative force and adopting creative practices.
 
✓ Creativity isn’t really about play or games. You need to approach it 
with respect because it’s a powerful thing — perhaps the most powerful 
thing. Life is a powerful creative force; each birth brings a unique new 
being to life. The world is inherently creative, and so are you. You can 
and should tap into the power of this creative force.
You can see the power of creativity each time a successful innovation 
changes lives and the world. Creativity is an extremely powerful asset. When 
you use your natural creative power to innovate in your own life or to bring 
innovations to the lives and work of others, you’re quite capable of changing 
your world.
The fact, however (and it’s a somewhat sad one), is that most people never 
fully realize their creative potential. Most of us don’t tap into the strength 
and power of our own creative capacity — let alone the additional capacity 
of those around us. Here are several proactive practices that can help you 
engage your creative force more fully than most people do.
Generating more ideas
Make a habit of thinking about possibilities. A simple way is to start with 
your own needs.
Imagining innovations to meet your daily needs
We think about needs constantly. I need coffee to get going in the morning, 
for example. Someone had a similar need and invented a coffee maker with 
a built-in timer. In thinking of the next breakthrough in coffee making, I start 
by considering my needs. I don’t mind my home-brewed coffee, but really, I 

13
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
prefer to have someone at a good cafe make me a cappuccino or latte from 
Italian espresso beans. This leads me to the idea of a coffee cart that would 
drive around my neighborhood and provide me a fresh-brewed gourmet 
coffee as I get into my car on the way to work — or maybe as I get out of 
my car in the parking lot before going into work. Aha! I haven’t even had my 
coffee yet, and I’ve had an innovative idea! It’s going to be a creative day.
Recognizing great ideas
Another good way to boost your creativity is to simply take note of creativity 
around you. People are surrounded by creativity and innovation but usually 
pass by it without taking special note. Recognize that you need the stimula-
tion of other people’s creative thinking. I collect good examples, rather the 
way an art collector gathers fine paintings. When I see a clever new product, 
I admire the insight of its inventor.
I also keep an eye out for creative advertising. Ad agencies have so-called cre-
ative departments full of wacky people whose job is to dream up something 
clever. Sometimes they actually do, and their example can inspire you to try 
new approaches to your own daily challenges.
Why start yet another memo or staff e-mail with a boring subject line when a 
catchy headline might make your point more creatively? Maybe you’ll send 
out an e-mail to your staff with a subject line like “Breaking news: There is 
such a thing as a free lunch!” as a way to entice everyone to come to a lunch-
time training session in your department. If you use that headline, of course, 
you’ll have to actually deliver lunch for free, which may not be in your 
budget. But maybe you could get creative and ask the newest restaurant in 
your area if it would like to take advantage of an opportunity to provide sam-
ples of its fare to a group of local professionals. That way, you won’t have to 
find cash in your budget for that free lunch. There’s always a creative option, 
if not two or three.
Holding out for more options
Perhaps the simplest but most powerful creative practice is to insist (to your-
self and to others) that there must be more choices. Creativity expands your 
options — but only if you realize that more options are better.
Imagine that you’re being held captive in a locked basement, and your captor 
gives you a gruesome choice: You may either shoot yourself and die quickly 
(a loaded gun is provided for this purpose), or you may wait while the base-
ment is flooded and then die slowly by drowning. Which option do you 
choose? If you say “Neither,” you’ve taken the creative approach to this prob-
lem, but you were given only two choices, so it’s up to you to create more 
options. Have any ideas? I know that it’s hard to think under pressure, but 
please hurry up; your captor has snaked a hose down into the basement and 
is about to turn the water on. . . .

14
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
What did you come up with? Here are a few options I thought of:
 
✓ Find the toolbox (there’s always one in a basement, right?), and use a 
screwdriver to remove the hinges from the basement door.
 
✓ Shoot the gun at the main electrical line (there’s one coming into a 
breaker box in most basements) to start a fire, setting off the fire alarm, 
which is required in most building codes and, if you’re lucky, is linked to 
a central dispatcher.
 
✓ Get your captor talking at the basement door (before he turns the water 
on), and shoot him through the door.
 
✓ Shoot the hose with the aim of breaking it and pushing the end out of 
the basement.
 
✓ Try to trick your captor into coming into the basement (perhaps by 
saying that you choose to shoot yourself, but the gun is jammed, and 
can he show you how to fix it?); then escape while the door’s open.
 
✓ Find the master valve that controls the water to the building, and turn it 
off. (There’s usually one in the basement.)
This mental exercise may seem to be far removed from your workplace chal-
lenges, but it’s really not. Most of the time when there’s a budget crunch, for 
example, senior management fails to ask for ideas before resorting to the axe. 
Suppose that someone says, “We’ve got to cut the budget, so decide which 
of your five staffers to lay off.” You ought to stop and look for alternatives 
before you pull the trigger on anyone’s job. There’s always another way.
How about retaining all five employees but shifting them to four days a week, 
or looking for ways to conserve energy and materials instead of cutting staff? 
A brainstorming session with your staff might produce many practical ways 
to cut the budget without laying anyone off. It’s worth a try. A little creative 
thinking can make a bad situation much better than it looks at first glance.
 
See Part II of this book for lots of techniques and tricks that can help you gen-
erate more options.
Identifying your biggest 
barriers to creativity
We all have the potential to generate imaginative insights and ideas, but most 
of the time, we don’t. Why not? The biggest reason is that we’re hemmed in 
by numerous barriers to creativity, especially at work.

15
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
Knowing your creative enemy
Studies show that the following are major barriers to creativity in the workplace:
 
✓ Lack of time and opportunity
 
✓ Criticism by others
 
✓ Strict, stern, or critical supervision
 
✓ Rigid policies, rules, procedures, or practices
 
✓ Exhaustion or lack of regular sleep
 
✓ Pessimism and negative thinking
 
✓ Lack of diverse experiences and inputs
 
✓ Either–or thinking that keeps people from exploring multiple options
 
✓ Lack of support for new ideas and approaches from your boss 
or colleagues
 
✓ Not knowing how to apply your creativity to your work
 
✓ Self-censorship due to lack of confidence, uncertainty, self-doubt, 
shyness, or other reasons
When you recognize your own barriers, you can take steps to reduce their 
power over you. If peers are negative thinkers who dismiss ideas out of 
hand, for example, do your creative thinking out of range of their negative 
comments. If you’re under too much time pressure to think creatively about 
problems and needs, give yourself a creativity break: Get away from your 
desk, and spend a lunch hour walking and thinking without the pressure of 
constant interruptions.
Also, don’t let self-censorship get in your way: Allow yourself to generate 
many ideas without concern for quality. Every barrier can be countered 
with a simple strategy that reduces its influence, at least long enough to 
allow you to generate some insight. For more help identifying your barriers, 
try taking the Personal Creativity Assessment created by yours truly (pub-
lished by HRD Press and available on the Web site that supports this book, 
www.supportforinnovation.com).
Being alert to your stylistic strengths and weaknesses
Your creative style — the way you approach challenges requiring innovation — 
can also be a barrier to creativity because some people naturally prefer 
a structured, planned approach to a looser or more intuitive approach. 
Structure and planning are excellent for developing and refining a concept 
after you’ve come up with it, but they get in the way of initial insights. If 
you like to do things in order, value neatness, and feel most comfortable 
working from a specific plan, you’ll find it difficult to switch to a freestyle, 
imaginative approach.

16
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
To switch your style and come up with fresh new ideas, think of creativity 
as a form of play. When you play, you let go of normal inhibitions and open 
yourself to possibilities, proving that you’re capable of making creative leaps 
of the imagination, even if your normal professional style is stiff and structured.
Turn to Chapter 15 for more help on dealing with the limits (and correspond-
ing strengths) of your specific creative style. If you aren’t sure what your 
creative role is, visit www.supportforinnovation.com to test yourself 
and find out which stages of the innovation cycle (the process of generating, 
developing, and applying or commercializing an insight) are your strongest 
and weakest.
Bringing your creativity to practical, routine tasks
It may seem that innovation has to be about those major, once-in-a-lifetime 
ideas. Not so! There are a thousand small breakthroughs for every big one, 
and you’ll never come up with a big idea unless you build your creative mus-
cles by coming up with a thousand small ones first. Do things in new ways, 
and look for better approaches every day. (For specific tips on how to apply 
creativity in daily challenges, read Chapters 11, 12, and 13.) Also check out 
the sections “Constructing Your Creative Place” and “Introducing Creative 
Practices to Your Daily Routine,” later in this chapter.
Taking advantage of your biggest 
enablers of creativity
A creativity enabler is anything that stimulates your creativity. Common 
enablers include a good night’s rest, a change of scene, a good example of 
imaginative thinking, a cup of coffee, exercise, and a walk on the beach (or 
anywhere that’s relaxing, open, and natural). Also, anything that makes you 
laugh enables creative thought. You may have other more personal enablers 
too, such as a creative mentor you can talk to, a favorite place, or a hobby 
that helps you relax and get “in the zone.”
Visual images enable creative thinking because creative insights are often 
visual in nature. Too often, people approach work from verbal or quantitative 
perspectives. In fact, many challenges posed by employers and bosses are 
barriers to creativity, rather than enablers, because of the way they’re pre-
sented. If you reframe the question around some visual exercise, however, 
you can convert it to a powerful enabler of innovative ideas.
A great way to stimulate your own creative thinking is to collect a few simple 
visual images; clip them from magazines or pull them out of the library of 
symbols in any handy word processing or design program. Then challenge 
yourself to use each image to come up with an idea by analogy.

17
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
Figure 1-1 shows how you might set up a visual challenge for your imagina-
tion if you want to come up with a new line of clothing that could boost 
sales for a clothing manufacturer or designer. Try your hand at it right now 
(because practice helps boost creativity). Can you come up with any fun 
ideas for new clothing brands? Do any of the symbols suggest possible brand 
names and concepts?
When you’ve tried this exercise yourself, look at Figure 1-2, where I’ve exer-
cised my own imagination with this challenge. Are all my ideas likely to 
become million-dollar successes? I doubt it, but maybe one of them will.
 
It’s important to avoid self-critical thinking when you exercise your imagination 
(see “Identifying your biggest barriers to creativity,” earlier in this chapter).

Constructing Your Creative Place
Does your workplace encourage creative thinking? Probably not. I visit a lot 
of workplaces at big and small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and all 
sorts of government agencies, and in my experience, fewer than 1 percent of 
them are naturally creative spaces. This is a problem, because people need 
innovation at work, but the spaces they work in make it hard to create.
A creative space needs to do the following:
 
✓ Make it easy to focus on an important challenge or task without 
interruption.
 
✓ Offer control of the physical environment, including configuration of 
desk and chair, lighting, layout, decorative elements, and sounds.

19
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
 
✓ Offer varied and interesting inputs, including visual, verbal, and other 
sensory inputs.
 
✓ Make people feel very comfortable, focused, and able to come up with 
good ideas.
To stimulate creativity, your workspace should not feel cluttered or crowded, 
or make you feel frantic and stressed by constant interruptions and emergen-
cies. Unfortunately, this is just what most workplaces are like! It’s up to you 
to fight back by defending a place and/or time in your day where you can 
be creative and open to possibilities. Some people can’t achieve a calm, 
creative state of mind in their workplaces and have to resort to taking walks 
or retreating to a favorite coffee shop or park during their lunch break, but 
ideally, you can build a creative environment at work. Here are some ideas 
you can try:
 
✓ Post a sign asking not to be disturbed during certain times so that you 
can focus and think.
 
✓ Use a desktop lamp, shade, hanging cloth, or hinged freestanding screen 
to give yourself some control of your lighting.
 
✓ Clear the decks! Keep the cluttered pile of paperwork out of sight in a 
drawer or cabinet so that you’re truly able to focus on one important 
problem at a time and not always be reminded of other tasks.
 
✓ Introduce something playful to your workspace. Rotate tactile puzzles 
and windup toys through the space to give you a different kind of stimu-
lation than you usually get from work, or post humorous cartoons to 
inspire your imagination.
 
✓ If possible, introduce low-volume mood music of your choice (but of 
course, you’ll have to keep it quiet enough not to disturb anyone else’s 
concentration).
 
✓ Introduce something living, such as a potted plant or a vase filled with 
gravel, water, and spring bulbs.
 
✓ Display pictures of people who encourage you and believe that you 
are creative and brilliant. If this doesn’t sound like your spouse or 
children, put their pictures out of sight when you try to come up with 
breakthrough ideas, and select a mentor instead. If you don’t have a cre-
ative mentor, elect someone famous to fill the role. A picture of Albert 
Einstein really does make you smarter. Try it if you don’t believe me!
 
✓ Keep a scrapbook or screensaver file of beautiful art, nature photos, 
travel photos, or other images that help you feel removed from work 
and your usual routine. Open the folder and scan the images when you 
want to take a creative turn.

20
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
It’s important to find simple ways to protect your creative focus, whether 
by designating a space or a time to work on innovations, or both. Every 
workplace I’ve ever visited has had an official policy of being innovative, but 
because this goal is rarely translated into a work environment that’s good for 
innovative thinking, it usually comes to nought.
 
A perfect workspace or place is very helpful, but in truth, much of what goes 
on when you innovate takes place deep inside your head. It’s possible to 
stimulate breakthrough thinking by using your computer as a resource. Look 
up other people’s work, and seek inspiration on the Web. Create a computer 
desktop with resources that you find helpful in your creative thinking, such 
as helpful computer programs, templates, and (especially) file folders of 
examples. I like to gather visual images that inspire me. They could be clever 
inventions, inspiring landscapes, or any other images that catch my eye and 
stimulate my imagination.
Also consider creating a playlist of music that you’ve selected because it helps 
you think clearly and creatively. (My creative playlist includes all the Bach 
cello concertos, which for some reason are amazingly good for stimulating cre-
ative thought.) You may also want to organize a bookmark folder of interesting 
Web sites for doing research to support your creative thinking or stimulate 
new ideas. Plugging into the facts, ideas, and designs of hundreds of other 
people is a great way to power up your imagination. (You can find a selection 
of inspiring images and examples at www.supportforinnovation.com.)
Building your personal studio, shop, or laboratory
If you want or need to step up the innovation 
level with long periods of creative work, you 
may need to go beyond making small adjust-
ments to a conventional workspace. You may 
need to configure a real studio, lab, or work-
shop for yourself, where the entire space is set 
up and equipped to support the creative work 
you have in mind. Consider these possibilities:
 ✓ An inventor working with electronics 
needs a place to do electronic engineering 
(requiring a computer running specialized 
design software), plus perhaps a place to 
mock up circuit boards and another place 
to mock up the actual equipment that the 
circuit boards go into. Depending on what 
you’re working on, this workspace could be 
a fairly simple refit of a two-car garage or a 
very expensive high-tech laboratory requir-
ing the help of a venture-capital investor or 
an employer with a large research-and-
development budget.
 ✓ A marketer working on ad campaigns and 
Web sites needs a very different sort of 
space — a studio with a flip chart for brain-
storming, a computer with graphic design 
software and large display screen, and per-
haps a round table for laying out examples 
of competitors’ materials or holding group 
brainstorming sessions.
What kind of creative space do you need? Ask 
yourself this question and then do as much 
as you can (given your current resources) to 
create your own creative space.

 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
Introducing Creative Practices 
to Your Daily Routine
When I get called in to help an organization become more innovative, it’s 
usually because something has gone wrong and the organization needs a big 
breakthrough idea in a hurry. Generally, I find that it has no creative routine, 
meaning that I have to get it from 0 to 60 creative miles an hour in a hurry — 
a task that’s barely possible and usually quite a challenge. If you want to get 
in good cardiovascular shape by running, you don’t enter a marathon as the 
first step. You start jogging every morning and work up gradually to long 
distances. It’s really the same with creativity. Daily practice makes it easy to 
come up with the ideas you need, both big and small, when you need them 
most. If more people introduced creativity into their daily routines, they 
wouldn’t need me to rush in and run creative retreats. They’d simply have 
the ideas they needed when they needed them! This section covers simple 
ways to develop a positive habit of creativity.
Balancing tight and loose activities
A tight activity is one that has strict parameters or rules and little room for 
variation or creativity. Business values tight activities because they produce 
consistent performance. McDonald’s makes every burger exactly the same 
way, for example; that’s part of its success formula. Also, it’s important to 
enter accounting records accurately, using the same accounting system all 
year long.
Most of what people do in workplaces consists of tight activities. But tight 
activities put the right brain to sleep and reduce creative thinking. They need 
to be balanced with some loose activities.
A loose activity has little or no structure and no obvious right answer. It 
invites — in fact, requires — you to make things up as you go. Drawing a 
connect-the-dots picture is a tight activity; drawing a freehand picture of 
your own is a loose activity. Riding your bike, walking, or jogging a set route 
is a tight activity; exploring a new route is a loose activity. Learning a choreo-
graphed dance routine is a tight activity; choreographing or improvising your 
own dance is a loose activity.
What loose activities do you like to do? Make a list. Try to do at least one 
a day.

22
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Freeing yourself to daydream
Mixing some loose activities into your normal routine of tightly controlled 
tasks is helpful (see the preceding section), but it doesn’t guarantee break-
through ideas because it still keeps you highly active. If your day is pro-
grammed with so many responsibilities that you can barely catch your 
breath, you have no time for creative thoughts to percolate.
 
I have an acquaintance who’s an inventor. His output is largely creative. Every 
now and then, he patents some brilliant new invention that he’s spent months 
thinking through. The rest of the time, he does a lot of thinking. His favorite 
places to work are hammocks and couches. He likes to close his eyes and lie 
back, letting a problem float around in his imagination until something clicks 
into place in a new way. It may look like he’s napping. The only way you know 
that he’s not is that every now and then, he writes another brilliant idea.
I’ll bet that daydreaming on a couch is a very different approach to work 
from yours. If you’re too busy for your imagination to get a thought in edge-
wise, you’re going to have to take a timeout in your daily routine. Even ten 
minutes of gazing at the sky or walking through a flower garden may be 
enough to free your mind and allow creative thoughts to form. Your right and 
left brains compete for dominance, so to let your creative right lobe do its 
thing, you have to shut the logical, organized left lobe down at least once or 
twice each day.
 
Please note that this daydreaming has to take place before you get too tired 
for either side of your brain to do good work. If you work hard all day and then 
collapse on a couch in front of the TV, you won’t do any creative thinking, 
because you’ll already have used all your energy for thought. Build some day-
dreaming time into the early part of your day, when you’re still fresh enough 
to do good creative work.
Pursuing interesting questions instead 
of letting them pass by
When you make a point of mixing some loose activities (see “Balancing tight 
and loose activities,” earlier in this chapter) into your daily routine, and also 
find time to relax and let your mind wander or daydream now and then, you’ll 
find that your naturally inquisitive nature starts to express itself. You’ll be 
increasingly curious, and you’ll be able to tackle interesting questions, both 
practical and impractical (and either type is fine for stimulating innovative 
thinking).

23
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
It’s terrible to be too busy to take an interest in questions such as these:
 
✓ Why do we always do it that way? Isn’t there any better alternative?
 
✓ Do you think someone’s already solved this problem, and we just 
have to find out what they did?
 
✓ Why do we divide the work the way we do? Could it be divided 
up differently?
These questions are traditionally called “dumb questions” because they 
set aside our knowledge and experience; they get us to examine our assump-
tions and start all over with an open mind. Make a habit of asking dumb 
questions and exploring possibilities. Every innovation starts with a simple 
question. Ask enough questions, and you’ll find that you’ve seeded a lot of 
exciting innovation.
Cross-training the body 
to strengthen the mind
The mind and body are inextricably linked. You can’t do good creative work 
when you’re tense, irritable, sad, or depressed, and you can’t sustain creative 
effort if you’re ill, weak, or tired. The body needs to be in reasonably good 
shape and feeling fairly well for you to come up with good ideas. Therefore, 
you need to tend to your physical needs and adopt healthy practices to 
achieve your full creative potential. Exercise and healthy living are important 
to innovation.
In addition to keeping you healthy, exercise can broaden your thinking and 
strengthen your creativity if you seek out new experiences through your 
exercise regime instead of always doing the same thing day after day. Try 
to pick up a new sport, join a class you’ve never taken before, or work out 
with a new group of people to build training and ongoing learning into 
your workouts.
Trying a new sport or acquiring a new skill is very much like trying to invent 
something. You can expect lots of early failures and a feeling of naïveté or 
even ignorance, followed (if you persist) by the growth of competence and a 
growing feeling of mastery. This experience helps you feel good about being 
naïve and ignorant — something that you need to practice to avoid self-
censorship and fear of failure when you try to be creative at work.

24
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Seeking Broader Experience
Wide experience helps you innovate because, as I explain in Chapter 11, cre-
ative concepts often come from the combination of knowledge about appar-
ently unconnected things. It’s important to get out of your world and explore 
other people’s worlds so that you can draw on a breadth of knowledge and 
experience too.
Finding ways to challenge yourself
When people ask me what they can do to become leading innovators in their 
field, I always suggest that they study or work in some other field for a while. 
If you work in the insurance industry, go take an evening course on geology, 
art history, or microbiology; anything that you’re completely ignorant of will 
do the trick. Within a few weeks, you’ll be seeing your own field or work quite 
differently, I promise.
Studying another culture and its language is a great way to stimulate your 
thinking. Taking up a new hobby can also do the trick. I’ve met a lot of entre-
preneurs who built their hobbies into successful businesses. But there’s no 
one best way to ensure that you have a rich and varied range of knowledge 
and experience. Follow your nose, and let your curiosity be your guide. Being 
open to new challenges that interest you is a really great way to build your 
creative power. It gives you more inputs from which to create innovations, 
and it makes you flexible and hardy enough to be a champion of your innova-
tion as well.
Taking personal risks
Innovators don’t mind failure, but they aren’t gamblers. They take calculated 
risks that have a reasonably high chance of success. To increase your rate 
of creativity and produce more innovations, you need to avoid making wild 
or irresponsible gambles, but at the same time, you need to avoid playing it 
safe, worrying about what people will think or what will happen if you fail. 
These sorts of thoughts can sabotage your efforts at creativity.
A lot of interesting research shows that successful innovators, entrepreneurs, 
artists, scientists, and other highly creative people tend to be very open to 
new experiences and ideas, and have a strong feeling of self-determination. Self-
determination’s psychological meaning (similar to its political meaning) is 
the feeling that you can individually decide your own fate. People who 
are self-determined

25
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
 
✓ Have a sense of being in control of their lives.
 
✓ Tend to listen to their own ideas and instincts instead of always doing 
what others tell them or what convention says.
How do you gain the strength of will and self-reliance that highly self-
determined people instinctively have? You can strengthen these qualities 
by not worrying about the risks of being wrong or embarrassing yourself 
if you offer a suggestion that doesn’t work; tell yourself that you can come 
up with better approaches if you keep trying. Regulating your self-talk is a 
useful technique, especially when you combine it with a daily habit of open, 
creative practice. See Chapter 9 for specific ideas you can use to adopt a 
more optimistic, creative personality or strengthen the creative personality 
you already have.
It feels risky to stick your neck out with an opinion, option, or design of your 
own, but that’s just what business needs and what you need to do to have 
a successful career today. Practice self-determined, creative behavior until 
you begin to feel comfortable with the risks of being wrong and having your 
ideas shot down. I never worry that one of my suggestions will be shot down 
because I have confidence that I can always come up with more.
 
The nice thing about tapping into your creative force is that the more you use 
it, the stronger it gets. You may run the risk of being wrong now and then, but 
there’s one risk that you never need worry about: You’ll never run out of ideas! 
If one is shot down, just launch another, and another, and another. . . .
Spending more time with people 
who aren’t at all like you
Diversity is the fertilizer of innovation. Diverse experiences and acquain-
tances give you a diverse range of inputs and ideas to work with. Many 
successful innovations actually arise from pairs or teams of people whose 
cultural and intellectual backgrounds are very different. Opposites react. 
Take advantage of the learning and ideas you get from talking with people 
whose experiences are very different from your own.
On the flip side of the diversity coin, people who share your background and 
experiences are easy to be with, but they tend to shut down your creativity. 
Comfortable social situations are actually barriers to innovation. When all 
of a company’s managers are from the same background (or are the same 
gender or race), the company tends to stop innovating and eventually runs 
into trouble.

26
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Seeking the company of innovators
If you don’t spend time with creative people, you’ll have a hard time being 
creative yourself. The problem is that most of us work with people who 
aren’t creative (or who seem not to be creative).
Fewer than 10 percent of people are naturally highly creative, so your odds 
of bumping into someone who is naturally very creative are fewer than one 
in ten. Actually, the odds are worse than that in most workplaces, because 
hiring tends to emphasize qualifications and experience, not creativity. Even 
worse, of these few rare highly creative people, more than half hide their cre-
ative light under a bushel because of pressures to conform to a less creative, 
more conservative stereotype of what an ideal employee ought to be.
 
I once met a successful corporate chief executive officer who presented him-
self as a very cautious, conservative, dark-suited man at work, but on the 
weekends, he hybridized new varieties of day lilies. His secret creative pas-
sion helped nurture his natural innovativeness, and I think it kept him open 
to new ideas and strategies for his company. I thought it was a shame that his 
employees never saw this side of him, however, and I urged him to become 
more of a creative mentor by sharing information about what he did outside 
the corner office.
 
If you find yourself surrounded by people who don’t seem to be creative, seek 
out the company of some new friends, role models, or mentors. Most cities 
have inventors’ and entrepreneurs’ clubs, and I recommend attending a meet-
ing now and then to pick up some of the positive energy these groups always 
have. Creative energy flows across any and all boundaries, however, so you 
can get just as much energy from attending a fiction-writing workshop as you 
would from attending a more business-oriented event. Be broad-minded about 
Mixing it up for sustained success
My dad was a really good investment analyst 
and had a great eye for strong management 
teams. I once asked him why he pulled all his 
clients out of the stock of a particular com-
pany when others were still rating it as a buy. 
In response, he pointed to a photo of the board 
of directors and said, “Notice that they all look 
alike? There’s no diversity in their management 
team. I’m concerned that they’re riding on their 
laurels and don’t have new ideas.” He was right, 
and some years later, the company went into 
bankruptcy. That company was called Stone 
& Webster, and it was founded by my dad’s 
grandfather, Edwin S. Webster, along with his 
roommate from the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Charles Stone. Therefore, it was 
hard for my dad to sell off the stock, but he knew 
that a lack of diversity was bad for business.

27
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
your search for creative peers. Why not volunteer to help design and build 
sets for an amateur theatrical production? Anything creative and fun will do 
the trick; it doesn’t have to be directly related to your profession.
Getting out of your personal 
and career silos
Experts on organization design use the term silo (from the tall grain silos 
of traditional farms) to describe workplaces where people are isolated into 
groups based on their functions. It seems efficient to have all the salespeople 
in one place doing sales and all the accountants in another place doing 
accounting. Why should they ever intermingle? If accountants are concerned 
about an increase in the discounts given out by salespeople, however, what 
can they do about it except perhaps complain to headquarters? If the two 
functions had some overlap, accountants and salespeople might naturally 
chat about such a trend and come up with an insight of value to the company.
Organizations do best when they don’t have tall silos in which groups, teams, 
divisions, subsidiaries, or functions are isolated from one another. You also 
benefit from getting out of your silo, and you should try to get out as often 
as you can, even if your employer doesn’t make it easy to do so. Try one or 
more of these ideas:
 
✓ Take a rotational assignment in another location and/or function.
 
✓ Wander into unfamiliar parts of your workplace to find out what the 
people there do.
 
✓ Take a class or workshop in a field you know nothing about.
 
✓ Read another profession’s magazines or blogs instead of your own.
Any of these activities will help you mingle with people who work in different 
silos, exposing you to fresh thinking and ideally building your cross-silo net-
work of professional acquaintances, too.
Supporting inquisitive behavior
An advantage of finding and spending time with creative people is that you 
can encourage one another’s creativity. I use the term inquisitive behavior to 
describe the general approach of asking questions and stimulating creative 
thought. Inquisitive behavior is the same in every field. It gets you thinking 
about creative possibilities by asking open-ended questions (questions that 
don’t have any clear right answer).

28
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
When someone from your creative peer group or your workplace asks an 
inquisitive question, encourage creativity by taking the question seriously 
and helping that person come up with possible answers. Also try asking 
inquisitive questions yourself — the more the better, especially in tradition-
ally noncreative settings like staff meetings.
Here’s an example of inquisitive questions you might ask in a meeting 
addressing the practice of offering customers discounts to close the sale:
 
✓ Inquisitive question: Why is it called discounting? What are the origins 
of that term?
 
✓ Insightful answer: Roman merchants would place extra product to the 
side of a pile being counted and offer to throw in the extra if the buyer 
purchased the counted pile at the asking price.
 
✓ Possible creative response: Stop discounting the price, and return to 
the practice of offering extra free merchandise instead. That way, cus-
tomers continue to pay the list price, and they hold more inventory 
of your product, delaying the time when the competition will have an 
opportunity to try to take the customer away.
Inquisitive questions can lead to new solutions, as this example illustrates. 
Without an inquisitive question or a few, a staff meeting on the topic of dis-
counting would simply focus on how big a discount to give. With inquisitive 
thinking, that same meeting can explore alternatives to straight discounting.
 
That said, think about the normal staff meeting and what would happen if 
someone asked, “Hey, what do you think the origins of the word discount are? 
Where’d it come from?” Most likely, the boss or someone else in the room 
would quickly say, “Would you please stay on topic? We aren’t historians; 
we’re salespeople.” Oops — so much for inquisitive thinking. Be careful not 
to shut it down, and if someone else tries to, shut him or her down by saying 
something like this: “Hold on. Let’s give the question a chance. Sometimes, the 
strangest questions produce the most useful answers.”
Learning from innovation mentors
To find a good innovation mentor (someone who can help you learn how 
to innovate and create), look for a person whom you find to be personally 
inspiring and who thinks you have a lot of untapped potential.
 
It’s best to find a mentor who doesn’t supervise you or have any other formal 
relationship with you, whether professional or personal, so that your men-
toring relationship is the only way you relate. That way, you can focus 100 
percent on discussing your career path, your current projects and challenges, 
and your ideas and how to move them ahead.

29
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
Also try to find people who have implemented an innovation by heading a 
team that brought about a major change or by starting a company or launch-
ing a new invention. Anyone who has brought about something new will have 
lots of helpful insights into the challenges of building momentum and imple-
menting a new idea.
Mentoring is growing more common, but in most organizations it doesn’t 
focus on innovation. Work to find a mentor who’s been a successful innova-
tor in the past and can share insights on invention, creative branding, novel 
business strategies, implementation, or other important innovation topics. 
Also try to make yourself available to mentees — people with less experience 
than you who would benefit from having access to your ideas and pointers. 
What goes around comes around, as they say, so by mentoring others, you 
may be more likely to be mentored yourself! (For more on how to set up and 
run productive meetings with your mentor or mentee, check out Chapter 3,

Becoming a Leading Innovator
Tapping into your personal creativity allows you to become a successful 
innovator, because creativity is the fuel of innovation. You need to make a 
practice of imaginative thinking so as to have the creative power you need to 
fuel your own innovative career, as well as to fuel the innovations you bring 
to your work and workplace. That’s why business innovation begins with a 
sustained effort to live a more creative life. An innovative approach benefits 
you in many ways:
 
✓ Helping you adapt to changing circumstances as you build a 
successful career
 
✓ Making you stand out from others, even if they have more formal 
qualifications or experience than you do
 
✓ Enriching your work by making each day a fresh, engaging experience 
rather than a boring routine
 
✓ Enriching your life by keeping your mind and body vital, flexible, 
and healthy
I’ve read a great many studies showing that people with an open, creative 
approach to life tend to live longer, rate themselves as happier than others, 
and have better luck avoiding major illnesses. They also tend to have more 
successful and profitable, as well as personally fulfilling, careers. There are a 
lot of reasons why you want to try to stand out as an innovator!

Making your creativity and 
drive visible to higher-ups
Many people are hesitant to offer suggestions or take initiative in their jobs, 
especially if they’re relatively young or inexperienced, or don’t hold a posi-
tion of power and authority. It’s a mistake to self-censor and hold your ideas 
back. How else are you going to stand out? How else are you going to get to 
do interesting new things? I hope that over the coming year, you’ll develop a 
reputation for being an exceptionally innovative and interesting person who 
stands out from your peers because of your creative ideas and willingness to 
tackle new challenges.
Many people fear that their competence will be questioned if they appear to 
be too creative or bring up too many suggestions (some of which inevitably 
will be ruled out as impractical or — dare I say it? — dumb). Competence 
and creativity are two separate things, and you can show your competence by 
doing careful work and following through on commitments. If you’re also bub-
bling over with ideas and enthusiasm, that’s a bonus that doesn’t detract from 
your competence; it adds another dimension to your workplace personality.
Another concern many people have is that they don’t want to be viewed as 
criticizing their boss or their employer as a whole. Okay, I agree — you don’t 
want to get stereotyped as a malcontent. But that has more to do with how 
you present your ideas than with whether you present them. If you frequently 
make disparaging or negative comments (“It’s stupid how we keep doing X 
and never come up with a better way,” for example), you’ll certainly earn 
a negative reputation. Instead of voicing criticisms, offer suggestions. Say 
“What if we replaced X with Y?” instead of “X doesn’t work well.”
Everyone (especially senior managers) likes innovators for their useful 
stream of positive suggestions. There’s a world of difference between innova-
tors and complainers. If something bothers you, take your complaint to 
your creative space (time, place, or virtual place; see “Constructing Your 
Creative Place,” earlier in this chapter), and turn that complaint into several 
alternatives. Then voice your positive suggestions instead of the negative-
sounding complaint.
Stepping up to development 
teams and roles
A great way to gain innovation expertise and show that you have lots of 
creative energy and initiative is to volunteer to help implement a positive 
new change. Most workplaces have at least a few committees, teams, or 
work groups that are tasked with solving a problem or handling a difficult 

31
 Chapter 1: Taking an Innovative Approach to Work
transition. Because these assignments are temporary, they draw on volun-
teers who do double duty, helping the team as well as covering their normal 
duties. Many people think that you’d have to be insane to take on an extra 
task voluntarily, but I think you’re insane if you don’t. It’s the perfect oppor-
tunity to test your innovation skills and demonstrate your resourcefulness 
and drive. Make something new happen in your workplace at least once this 
year — preferably before you finish reading this book.
If you have any trouble with people who resist the new and blame you for 
their problems, check out Chapters 9 and 13, where problem-solving and 
conflict-resolution strategies can help you deal with those naysayers in your 
workplace who don’t like innovation. Chapter 3 has resources for leading a 
project team, should you be lucky enough to be put in charge. And Chapter 
18 covers how to take an idea and run with it on your own as an entrepre-
neur, should you decide that it’s time to go out on your own and build your 
own business.

Creating an Innovative Career Path
In This Chapter
▶ Breaking out of the mold: Pursuing an adventurous career path
▶ Making diverse work experiences add up to an impressive résumé
▶ Exploring ways to grow your career
▶ Creating your own job opportunities
H
elen Keller famously wrote, “Life is either a daring adventure, or noth-
ing.” If given the choice, I’d opt for an adventure, but in truth, most 
people wobble down the middle, somewhere between nothing to write home 
about and a real adventure. This chapter will make sure that dull fate doesn’t 
happen to you!
Aside from avoiding boredom (or should it be spelled bore-dumb?), the 
pursuit of career adventures ensures that you achieve your full potential by 
enriching your skills, experiences, network, and knowledge base. And these 
days, if you hadn’t noticed, there aren’t any stable, guaranteed career ladders 
to climb, so if you want a great career, you have to invent it for yourself.
I coauthored a bestseller called Adventure Careers back in the 1990s. At 
the time, I wanted to help people discover meaningful work and avoid dull, 
cookie-cutter career paths, and from the hundreds of e-mails we got, our 
readers seemed very excited to find that they had creative options beyond 
the standard want ads. In retrospect, however, there turned out to be 
another benefit to their quest for unique, exciting work adventures: Now 
they’re all grown up and hold positions of leadership in business, nonprofit, 
entrepreneurship, and government sectors. Their early adventures made 
them successful by teaching them to be more flexible and innovative than 
their less adventurous peers. What I learned is this: Varied, exciting work 
experiences create the innovators and leaders of the future.
This chapter will help you chart an innovator’s course from where you are 
right now toward a more dynamic and enriching career that engages your 
imagination and drive to the fullest. There are practical things you can do to 
make your career more dynamic and find more opportunities to innovate. 
Start with a different view of your career; then follow through by seeking 
opportunities that fit your existing vision of what you’d like to do.

34
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Seeing Your Career as an Adventure
 
A good rule of thumb for innovators — or anyone, really, who wants to live an 
interesting and fulfilling life — is to always be doing something that makes a 
good story. What does that mean? It means that if you have to answer a ques-
tion like “What have you been up to?”, or you find yourself writing that 
proverbial letter home (or maybe today it’s a blog), you instantly know what 
you want to say because it’s a fun story that people will find engaging.
For example, as a sideline I’ve been working on a series of young-adult fantasy-
adventure novels for a few years. When asked why I’m doing this, I simply 
tell the truth of the matter, which is that my eldest daughter, when she first 
went off to a sleep-away summer camp, wanted me to write her every day. I 
couldn’t think of what to say, so I started writing her a story, and by the end 
of the summer she had a large pile of cards and a desire to see what would 
happen next. So did I, so I turned them into a book (see www.thestoryof 
drift.com for details, if you’re interested). That’s what’s called a back story 
in fiction writing — background information that helps bring a character (or 
in this case, a book) to life. You need to accumulate interesting back stories 
too, so that you, as a character in a résumé, come to life and so that your 
résumé develops three-dimensionality that other résumés lack.
The way to develop an interesting character in fiction is to put the 
character in a challenging situation and see what he or she does. How will 
your character get out of trouble this time? It’s really that simple to write 
exciting stories, and it’s that simple to develop a rich, varied, and innovative 
career, too. Just put yourself in a new and challenging situation, preferably 
one you’ve never been in before and don’t feel qualified to handle, and then 
see how you do. I guarantee that despite a few tense moments, you’ll come 
through just fine in the end. The hero of the story always does!
Breaking through the barriers 
to career change
If you go from school to an entry-level job in a field and then work your 
way up, perhaps getting some additional training along the way, you soon 
find that you have greatly narrowed your options. Giving up on your field 
and starting all over again in another would mean giving up the salary level 
you’ve achieved, as well as having to compete against younger entry-level 
employees. Many people feel that they’re trapped by their own career success 
and can’t change direction. The main barriers you run into if you try to do 
something creative or different are

35
 Chapter 2: Creating an Innovative Career Path
 
✓ Practical financial barriers associated with taking a cut in pay or benefits
 
✓ A credibility problem when you try to talk a new employer into hiring 
you to do something you don’t have much experience doing
 
✓ A lack of self-confidence arising from your lack of traditional qualifica-
tions and experience
 
✓ Possible age or other forms of discrimination if you don’t fit the mold of 
the typical applicant
Of these four barriers to doing something new and different, three are largely 
external, and one is internal: your own confidence issues and concerns. 
Tackle that one first because it’s more fully in your control and also because 
it has considerable influence on the other three barriers.
 
In my experience, you can often overcome the initial resistance of potential 
employers by exhibiting a really positive, can-do attitude. Wise employers 
know that they can teach skills, but they can’t develop good attitudes in 
people; they have to hire for that quality.
Have faith that if you believe you can and should do something new to 
broaden your experience, you will eventually find an employer who agrees 
and likes your positive attitude and enthusiasm. This person may be a rare 
employer, but keep searching until you find her. She’s not only your next 
boss, but also a potential mentor for your innovative career, because she 
understands the value of diverse experiences and values a creative approach.
If you’re locked into an expensive lifestyle you can barely afford, finances 
are something you need to work on right away. They can be improved only 
incrementally, so get started immediately, and work on them for the next six 
months to a year. Here’s what to do:
 
✓ Reduce your carrying costs. These costs are the regular (monthly 
or quarterly) expenses you have to cover to pay your bills. Get rid of 
expensive vehicles, appliances, memberships, and leases. Most house-
holds can cut their routine bills by about 20 percent without any major 
changes in lifestyle.
 
✓ Chip away at credit-card bills, and stop using all credit cards at once! 
If you can’t afford it on a debit card, don’t buy it, period. (That goes for 
automobiles too. If you can’t afford to buy a car with cash, don’t buy it. 
Your career is much more valuable in the long run than your ride.)
 
✓ Move to a less expensive home. Most people’s largest expense is 
housing. Keep in mind that transportation is often the second- or third-
largest household expense, so try to move somewhere in or near a 
major metropolitan area offering lots of work, study, and volunteering 
options, plus public transportation if possible.
 
 Also consider sharing an apartment or duplex. Often, this approach can 
cut your living costs by 30 percent to 50 percent.

36
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
 
✓ Take care of yourself. Good health is a money saver, whereas illness is 
financially debilitating. Exercise, healthy eating, avoidance of alcohol 
and drugs, and early bedtimes add up to real savings in the household 
budget and free you to focus on developing an interesting, innovative 
career. (In fact, healthy habits are a bigger financial factor than health 
insurance, because an illness prevented saves, on average, a lot more 
than a year’s worth of health insurance premiums.)
 
Make do with a smaller place and a less expensive lifestyle, and keep yourself 
healthy and fit. The goal is to see how small a percentage of your income you 
have to spend each month to cover the bills. If you can begin to get ahead of 
your costs and run a substantial surplus, you can reinvest that personal profit 
in an innovative career. In other words, invest the extra cash in yourself!
Making opportunistic moves
When you work on your financial and emotional health, and no longer feel 
trapped in your current position (see the preceding section for tips on how 
to do this), you’re ready to answer the door when opportunity knocks.
 
Speaking of opportunity knocking, you can get more information on the topic 
of finding an exciting dream job at the Opportunity Knocks Web sites: www.
knocks.com, where you can reach President Wendy Terlwelp for personal 
branding and career coaching, and www.opportunityknocks.org, where 
hundreds of interesting job openings in nonprofits and charitable organiza-
tions are posted.
You can find lots of similar services on the Web by searching for interesting 
job openings and career boards where openings are posted. Type “finding 
a better job” into your favorite search engine. Also check out Monster 
(www.monster.com), Employment Spot (www.employmentspot.com), 
and CareerBuilder (www.careerbuilder.com).
Moving toward growth with your current employer
The most obvious opportunities are the ones closest at hand. If your current 
employer has any interesting new opportunities, consider making a move, 
even if it’s a lateral move (at the same pay level) or a downward move (at a 
lower pay level). The level is less important than the momentum of a posi-
tion. Momentum means growth and future potential, and you should always 
be looking for and moving toward where the momentum is. If your employer 
is cutting back in most areas (as many are), chances are that there’s still one 
area in which hiring is going on because of an urgent need to increase staff. 
Try to shift to a position — any position — in that growth area. Whatever it 
entails, it will expose you to some cross-training and teach you some skills 
that are of growing economic value.

37
 Chapter 2: Creating an Innovative Career Path
Working your networks for opportunities
Your personal and professional networks are great sources of opportunity. 
If you hear that someone is looking for somebody to do something that inter-
ests you, get in touch with that person, and find out more about the opportu-
nity. Take a “why not?” approach to such opportunities, and see whether you 
find them interesting.
Taking on short-term and volunteer projects
A great many short-term, part-time projects are available. Some pay well; 
others, such as internships and volunteer work, not so well. I think it’s good 
to be doing one such short-term project at all times, even if you’re holding 
down a full-time job. The breadth of experience you gain and the rich 
professional network you build add up to a lot of benefits from those 
side assignments.
I’ve worked with hundreds of successful entrepreneurs, and more than 95 
percent of them had extraordinarily adventurous early careers character-
ized by many, diverse projects and positions. The richness of experience you 
gain from varied work adds up to a better ability to innovate in the future, 
whether you do it as an employee, a freelancer, or a business-building 
entrepreneur.
Counting Up Your Transferable 
Skills and Experiences
When your aim is to climb a fixed career ladder, you need to accumulate a 
series of ever-higher positions within a specific field. A traditional résumé 
tells the story of such a career climb by listing job titles and responsibilities 
by year. First, you may have been an assistant; next, a junior manager; then 
a department manager . . . and so on. Your career is unlikely to consist of a 
straightforward climb up a fixed ladder, but your résumé probably still looks 
like that’s what you’re trying to do. This format is the traditional approach to 
résumés and the one that most people follow.
A better approach is to create a list of the competencies you’ve gained 
through your varied work experiences, and make note of how each expe-
rience contributed to specific competencies. (I might note that I gained 
leadership skills through my work on the boards of directors of numerous 
nonprofits and my coaching of youth soccer teams, as well as any manage-
ment positions I held in my formal, paying work.) Where have you picked 
up leadership skills and experiences? Making a list may help you prove that 
you’re qualified for an exciting new paid opening or volunteer opportunity.

38
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
After you document your experiences and how they add up to skills and 
qualifications, you’re ready to write a modified résumé. You can (if you think 
it necessary) keep the format looking traditional, but make a point of noting 
the specific transferable skills you gained under each job listing. Also add 
part-time and volunteer jobs, as well as any major projects you worked on for 
full-time employers. Listing such experiences separately helps you tell your 
story better.
 
If you’re dealing with an open-minded or nontraditional interviewer, consider 
reformatting your résumé as a table. Down the left side, list jobs and projects 
(as in a traditional résumé). Across the top, label the columns with specific 
skills (such as Communications, Leadership, Design and Invention, or 
Software Programming; see Figure 2-1). Then fill in cells appropriately to show 
how and where you gained experiences in each of the columns. This tabular 
format makes clear sense of a diverse set of job experiences, helping potential 
employers see how you’ve been working steadily on core skills, even though 
you’ve done it across numerous jobs and projects.
As Figure 2-1 shows, you can organize seemingly disconnected experiences 
into a coherent description of your core competencies. (To prevent confu-
sion, limit the number of competencies to five.) At the top of this résumé, you 
can state a work goal or desired position that relates to the competencies. 
At the bottom, you can summarize the competencies that your various 
experiences demonstrate. The summary of your competencies should align 
with the requirements for the job you’re seeking. Check job descriptions 
from employers to make sure that you’re using this competency résumé to 
tell your story in a way that makes it obvious to potential employers that you 
have the needed experience and competencies, even if you haven’t done the 
specific job you want to apply for.
Drawing on experience to design 
a retro speedboat
Ross Hartman took a few engineering courses 
in college but has no formal training or 
experience in naval architecture — the engi-
neering and design of boats. That hasn’t 
stopped him from parlaying his practical 
experience as a builder and his rusty knowl-
edge of engineering into an exciting startup 
business that makes speedboats styled after 
classic cars of the 1950s and ’60s, such as the 
Ford Mustang. His business, Dana Levi Boats 
(www.danalevi.net), employs a naval 
architecture firm to produce construction blue-
prints and retains a boatyard in Florida to create 
the molded fiberglass hulls, but the design 
concepts all flow from the founder’s imagina-
tion and pen. Like many inventors, he had no 
formal training in the industry but had enough 
imagination, and enough general skills, to shake 
up the industry with something fresh and new.

Seeking Opportunities to Innovate
As you search for interesting opportunities (including projects at your regu-
lar workplace, volunteer jobs, and short-term or part-time jobs), favor those 
that encourage some form of creative expression. It takes creativity to
 
✓ Organize a fund-raiser for a nonprofit organization.
 
✓ Develop a solution to a challenging problem in your workplace.
 
✓ Redesign a workplace process to save money or improve quality.

40
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Anything that isn’t “by the book” may be a good opportunity to express 
yourself. Tackle extra assignments or new jobs with an innovative spirit, and 
make an effort to do something new and innovative in each job and project 
you undertake. The big-picture idea is to treat everything you do as an oppor-
tunity to make your mark as an innovator. Of course, this goal is easier to 
achieve if you select jobs and projects for their creative potential and avoid 
ones in which you’d be expected to follow a set of instructions to the letter.
 
If you type “creative work” in a search engine, you’ll come up with lists of 
so-called creative jobs, such as ad design, software design, and painting (not 
house painting, but painting for gallery sales). These careers can be creative, 
of course, but the lists miss the key point: Creativity and innovation are impor-
tant in a great many careers and jobs, not just those in the arts. Engineering 
is creative. Managerial leadership is creative. Business strategy is highly cre-
ative, which is why I tend to run a strategic planning retreat in much the same 
way that I run a creative branding retreat, with lots of idea-generation activi-
ties to open the mind to possibilities. If your current job doesn’t permit you to 
innovate, start searching for another job today. There are lots of them. What 
makes a job creative and innovative is a desire on the part of management to 
be creative. If the members of the senior management team understand that 
they need fresh ideas to grow and prosper, they’ll probably value your initia-
tive and ideas.
Moving Toward Growth
As you pursue your innovative career, make a point of pursuing growth. 
Growth takes several main forms:
 
✓ Your own development of knowledge, skills, credentials, and relation-
ships with a wide range of interesting and accomplished people
 
✓ Growth areas (such as a growing department) within an organization 
where you work
 
✓ Economic growth in specific regions and sectors
Encouraging your own personal growth
 
Your personal growth is the most important dimension of growth to keep in 
mind as you navigate your career options. Make a point of learning and devel-
oping at a high rate to keep yourself sharp and up-to-date as an innovator.

41
 Chapter 2: Creating an Innovative Career Path
If you use the competency-based, tabular résumé format illustrated in Figure 2-1, 
it’s easy to see where your holes are and where you could use more experience. 
Create a large, for-your-eyes-only, and very detailed version of a competency 
résumé to help you decide which opportunities or experiences to pursue next.
Targeting growth areas in 
your current organization
Keep in mind that in organizations, there are generally stagnant areas you 
want to avoid and exciting areas where growth is taking place. Go where the 
growth is, even if the jobs aren’t as stable and well-paying as more traditional 
ones. In the end, growth wins out over stability every time.
A biological analogy is helpful: Visualize an established business as though it 
were a giant plant. Somewhere down at its historical base is a solid old trunk 
of dead wood, while up in the leafy branches is fresh green growth. Some 
people are naturally suited to positions in the trunk. That’s fine for them, but 
their careers are going to be dull and stagnant because they favor stability 
over growth. Keep in mind that new skills are developing and the seeds of new 
enterprises are growing at the flexible ends of young, leafy branches, not down 
at the base of the old tree. The branches are where new ideas and new technol-
ogies are being tested, and where new market opportunities are being pursued.
To take advantage of the growth areas of your employer, join task forces 
working on new ideas or implementing new technologies. Also see whether 
you can help with the sourcing or development of new products. And if your 
employer opens a new office or expands into a new market, be the first to 
volunteer for the challenging (and perhaps risky) assignments out there on 
the frontier of your business’s growth. That’s where you get the opportunities 
to innovate and problem-solve, and it’s where you gain the skills that will 
make you an appealingly innovative candidate when you next apply for a 
desirable job.
Taking advantage of fast-growing cities
Give some thought to geographic and demographic growth trends. In the 
United States, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York are adding people faster 
than other large cities, making them good areas to work. For the absolutely 
fastest rates of growth, however, several small cities top the list, including 
Round Rock, Texas; Cary, North Carolina; and Gilbert, Arizona. If you work in 
any of these cities, odds are that your career will grow faster than elsewhere 
in the country, and more opportunities will open up to you. If you’re stuck 
in a low-growth or shrinking area, bite the bullet and move to a fast-growth 
area right away. It’s really, really hard to have a successful career outside a 
growth area.

42
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
If you look at social statistics for the United States, you’ll see that Hispanics 
(a diverse set including people of various Latin American national origins) 
are a large and fast-growing category. Businesses and services of interest 
to Hispanics are going to have a leg up because of this population growth. 
Similarly, the smaller but even faster-growing category of people who identify 
themselves as multiracial or biracial is reported to be the fastest-growing 
group in the United States, perhaps presenting interesting opportunities to 
innovators who can think of ways to serve this group’s needs. Ideas, anyone?
Serving the fastest-growing age groups
If you slice the population by age, you’ll find that one particular age bracket 
is growing faster than the others. Which one? It varies by country. In slower-
growing, highly industrialized countries like the United States, Canada, Great 
Britain, and Japan, it’s the elderly. People over 85 are the hottest growth 
sector of these mature economies, believe it or not. In less-developed coun-
tries with faster population growth, teens or young adults often make up the 
fastest-growing group. Clearly, economic opportunities for innovators differ, 
depending on whether population growth is centered in the elderly or the 
young of a country. In one case, innovations in education are greatly needed; 
in the other, healthcare and elder care are hot areas.
Tapping into international growth
Study your country’s growth patterns, and make sure that your work is of 
importance to some growing group, whether defined geographically or by 
social or population statistics. Also be open-minded about international 
opportunities. Right now, enterprising young adults in the United States are 
mindful of the fast economic growth in China and India and are looking for 
opportunities to tap into these hot international economies.
My son Paul, who graduated from college last year, entered the U.S. job market 
during the trough of a deep recession. His solution? He got a job teaching English 
at a Chinese university and headed off for a year abroad. He’d studied Chinese in 
college, fortunately, so his job search wasn’t confined to the United States.
Inventing Your Next Job
Most people search for work. That approach reflects a noncreative view of 
work in which you assume that someone else has to create your opportunities 
for you, and all you do is apply and hope to be selected. In an innovative 
career, you turn that assumption over and think of your next job as some-
thing you will create.

43
 Chapter 2: Creating an Innovative Career Path
Proposing a new position for yourself
Take a good look at your own organization or any other that you know some-
thing about and have access to. What does it need? Where are its biggest prob-
lems and opportunities? If you were in charge, what new position would you 
want to create and fill with an eager innovator like yourself? When you have 
an idea in mind, write it up (use the same format for job descriptions that the 
organization does) and then send a cover letter and your new job description 
to an appropriate contact. There’s a chance that your proposal will be picked 
up and you’ll be hired to do the job you so thoughtfully crafted. It’s certainly 
worth a try.
If you think imagining a new position, writing the job description, sending 
it in, and getting hired to fill it seems unlikely, think about what consultants 
do to make a living. I’ve done a fair amount of consulting, often because I’ve 
talked some executive into listening to my proposal telling her what I think I 
can do to help her company out. In other words, to get hired as a consultant, 
I had to persuade someone that there was a need for me. It’s commonplace 
for consultants to do this, but nobody else in the job market ever does. Take 
it from an old consultant: The best jobs are always the ones you invent for 
yourself.
Generating freelance and 
consultative work
If your proposal to create a new job opening for yourself (refer to the preced-
ing section) doesn’t get accepted, think about freelance consulting instead. 
For every permanent new position, there are dozens of short-term, project-
oriented opportunities. I’ve learned more from my consulting experiences 
than from any full-time job I’ve ever had. Consulting is fun. Well, not fun like 
a vacation in Cancun, but fun in the way that exciting, high-pressure perfor-
mances are fun. Tackling a tough project on a deadline is always a challenge, 
and challenges bring out your innovative best, right?
To find freelance and consultative work, keep in mind that 90 percent of 
consultants are hired by someone who already knows them. You need to 
work your professional network to find out what’s needed and who to talk to.
 
Join professional organizations in your area, whether that area is defined by 
geography, a professional field, or (preferably) both. Attend meetings, espe-
cially if a sit-down meal is in the offing. I’m not saying this because I like free 
food (although I do!) but because the best networking happens when you get 
a chance to sit and share a meal with a group of people who share a profes-
sional interest. Meals last long enough and are relaxing enough that you can 
strike up real conversations and make new friends.

Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
After you zero in on some opportunities for freelancing, present yourself 
promptly and professionally. The early bird gets the worm, so don’t delay, 
wondering whether you’re the right person. Pick up the phone or get on 
e-mail and make contact right away, preferably early in the workday. Then 
dress yourself, and your résumé, according to professional custom in the 
business or industry in question, and set up a face-to-face meeting as soon 
as you can. Beyond that, there isn’t much of a formula.
It’s probably best to avoid fancy sales pitches. Just be yourself. Ask questions; 
offer suggestions; smile; and say that you think you can solve the problem, 
whatever it is. See whether the potential client will offer you a contract, and 
if it does, agree to start right away. Eagerness wins the most contracts in the 
consulting game. Inflexibility and a demanding, arrogant approach lose the 
most contracts.
Developing entrepreneurial career options
Most of the really creative people I know have started at least a few new busi-
nesses, theater groups, dance companies, charities, or other organizations. 
The interesting thing is that the majority of these people don’t call themselves 
entrepreneurs and have no intention of starting the next big business. They 
just have good ideas that seem to need an organization, so they start calling 
people up, and soon, they’ve gotten another organization off the ground. They 
may do this work entirely in their spare time outside a 9-to-5 job, but still, it’s 
probably the most meaningful and exciting thing they do all year.
I recommend this approach. Start something small in your spare time, and 
get others to help you grow it into an established entity with a life of its own. 
Who knows? Maybe it will grow large enough to take the place of your regular 
job, but even if it doesn’t, it will give you lots of great opportunities to 
strengthen your creative skills.

T
he world needs innovative leaders. Okay, sure, sometimes, in some 
places, what’s wanted is stewards who protect tradition and prevent 
change. The emperors of ancient China decided to close their kingdom off 
from the outside world and stop things from changing, and they succeeded 
for a while — but innovation continued beyond their borders, leaving them 
so weakened that they lost control and were overthrown. In the end, it’s 
always better to be on the side of innovation.
Fast-forward to today, when the need for innovative leadership is urgent. 
When leaders forget that they’re supposed to be creating helpful new ways 
of doing things, the economy slides toward ruin. Innovative leadership is the 
fuel of healthy economies and societies.
You need to be an innovative leader. It’s the one universal trait in any and 
every successful career, whether in or out of the business world. I train a lot 
of leaders with a wide range of competencies. A U.S. Coast Guard officer obvi-
ously knows things that a bank manager doesn’t, and vice versa. But every 
leader needs to know how to support and direct the work of others — and, 
periodically, to spearhead innovative changes.
This chapter bumps up your innovative leadership skills a few levels by 
addressing the ways you challenge your team and how you adjust your lead-
ership style to help your team innovate effectively.

Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Visualizing the Possibilities for 
Innovative Leadership
It’s natural to focus on making sure that everybody’s at their desks or work-
stations, has something to do, and is doing it at least moderately well. But 
supervising the details of your team’s work is only one small part of your 
leadership responsibilities. You want to get everyone oriented and working 
on the right tasks before you run out of energy so you can look up and think 
about the future while they work. Leadership means, most simply, creat-
ing positive momentum toward a good goal or objective for the future and 
making sure that everyone is moving in that direction.
You can think of your leadership job as having two main parts that you can 
visualize as a house with a triangular roof. The house represents the current 
activities that need to be coordinated, and the triangular roof turns the house 
into a directional arrow pointing upward. The roof is created by the sense 
of purpose and direction of the leader’s vision. When you visualize positive 
change, you provide an overarching structure that gives meaning and energy 
to the daily grind. And when you make your goals ambitious and encourage 
innovative pursuit of them, you get everybody fired up about working for you.
Setting ambitious goals
Your vision needs to be ambitious. Don’t settle for just keeping things going 
or making do. That’s boring, and it doesn’t contribute much to the group 
you’re leading. What use is a vision that lacks vision? Here are some exam-
ples of good goals for innovative leadership:
 
✓ Double sales over the next two years.
 
✓ Upgrade to cutting-edge equipment and modernize the entire 
organization.
 
✓ Cut costs by 25 percent.
 
✓ Prevent accidents and achieve 100 percent safety.
 
✓ Find or develop a best-selling product to grow the business.
 
✓ Find a solution to a major problem so that the group can move on.
 
✓ Launch a major ad campaign that boosts sales and builds brand image 
substantially.

47
 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
The main point to keep in mind is that leadership vision has to have a cre-
ative element to it. You imagine a better future; then you help your group 
make that vision real. How do you go about imagining a better future? You 
might try starting with the simplest but perhaps the most powerful technique 
for innovative thinking: the creative thinking process illustrated in Figure 3-1. 
Often termed the Wallas model after Graham Wallas, who formalized it in 
his book The Art of Thought in 1926, it was first described in 1921 by Henri 
Poincaré, one of the most creative and important mathematicians of the 
19th century.
Following is Poincaré’s journal entry describing one of his most important 
contributions to mathematics. What’s interesting is the creative process and 
how it works:
“For fifteen days I . . . sat down at my work table . . . I tried a great number 
of combinations and arrived at no result. One evening, contrary to custom, 
I took black coffee; I could not go to sleep; ideas swarmed up in clouds; I 
sensed them clashing until, to put it so, a pair would hook together to form a 
stable combination. By morning I had established a class of Fuchsian func-
tions. I had only to write up the results which took me a few hours.”

Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
As Figure 3-1 illustrates, Poincaré’s process is comprised of four steps:
 
✓ Preparation: The essential first step for Poincaré (and anyone wanting 
to achieve a breakthrough idea) is to become deeply engrossed in your 
challenge. Hard, unrelenting effort, often without immediate results, is 
essential. Notice that Poincaré put a lot of focused effort into his inven-
tion. You need to focus hard on the question of what your leadership 
vision should be. Give yourself time to study your situation, and clarify 
your priorities before announcing what your goal is.
 
✓ Incubation: As arduous as preparation can be, it’s unlikely to produce 
an “aha” breakthrough unless you then introduce a period of incubation, 
in which you let the problem sit in your subconscious while you rest; do 
something else; or think about it in an unstructured, casual manner.
 
✓ Illumination: Make sure that you feel a real sense of excitement about 
the idea. That way, your idea will excite others too. A creative insight 
usually falls into place quite suddenly, instead of bit by bit, the way a 
logical step-by-step solution to a problem will.
 
✓ Verification: Check your idea or theory by testing it in the real world, 
such as by making a prototype. Testing your design or theory sometimes 
produces unexpected results, allowing you to return to the drawing board 
and refine your thinking.
 
By the way, Poincaré’s creative thinking process can be applied to many types 
of problems and design challenges, so it’s worth practicing until it comes natu-
rally to you.
Encouraging others to envision change too
When you lead, you need to demonstrate your commitment to innovation by 
being creative yourself and by having a vision of a positive future. In addition, 
you need to ask your team members to suggest ideas of their own. Your over-
arching vision of future improvements creates a gap between the present and 
the vision, and everyone can and should put creative energy into trying to fill 
that gap. The innovative leader doesn’t keep tight control of the creative think-
ing; she shares the responsibility and fun of innovating with the entire team.
Researchers have compared the behaviors of leaders who create innovations 
with the behaviors of those who don’t. The findings are clear and helpful: 
You need to lead in ways that encourage your entire group to be thoughtful 
and outspoken in the pursuit of improvements and new ideas.
Table 3-1 is a checklist you can use to make sure that you’re acting in ways 
that stimulate innovation and produce breakthroughs. (For details on the 
research behind this checklist, see the article “How Leaders Influence

plex, interesting tasks; rotating task 
assignments.
None of the activities in Table 3-1 is hard to do. The trick is to realize that 
they’re important. The checklist can be your toolbox of innovative leadership 
actions. Dip into it by using at least one of these actions a day, and you’ll 
have an innovative group, company, or team that will pursue your vision with 
enthusiasm.
 
The basic concept behind all the activities in Table 3-1 is job enrichment, in 
which the supervisor makes sure that each person is working on interesting 
challenges that engage a range of his or her abilities. Everyone has the ability 
to innovate, but few managers build innovation into the work their employees 
are doing. When you find ways to challenge people to generate and apply new 
ideas, you find — ta-da! — that they’re amazingly innovative after all.
Knowing when innovation is required
Innovating is a lifestyle. You need to make it a part of the regular routines 
of your workplace, so really, innovation should be on the agenda every day. 
Sometimes, however, innovation is truly essential and has to be the number-
one priority. When should you, as a leader, drop everything and make cre-
ativity and innovation your priority all day long?

51
 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
The trick is to know which strategic phase you ought to be in. Should your 
organization focus on efficient production or creative searching? Consider 
the following:
 
✓ Efficient production is what you do right after you’ve implemented one 
or more innovations and want to profit from them. You scale up by get-
ting everybody to do his part accurately and quickly — which adds up 
to cheaply when it’s done consistently. Efficient production is repetitive 
in nature and rewards consistency. It’s the order of the day until you 
sense that you’re beginning to lose the creative edge and it’s time to 
change over to something new.
 
✓ Creative searching is what you do when you know that you’ll need to 
make major changes soon, and you want to come up with or find the right 
set of innovations for the future. This book should be your business bible 
during the creative searching phase. Let things run themselves by routine 
as you focus your leadership time and energy on innovating.
 
Some organizations (especially the ones with big budgets) try to be in both 
phases at the same time. It’s important, however, to emphasize one over 
the other. You can’t really balance efficient production and creative search-
ing. They each have their own, quite opposite, demands. Both strategies are 
important at all times, but one should be dominant.
Usually, it works well to use a punctuated equilibrium approach, in which you 
have a routine of efficient production for some months or years, punctuated 
(or interrupted) by an intense phase of creative searching, followed (when 
you find the right innovation) by scale-up to another phase of efficient pro-
duction. You, as the innovative leader, are responsible for deciding which 
phase is appropriate and leading accordingly. (See Chapter 5 for more help 
with your strategies and plans.)
Getting to Know Yourself as a Leader
Many leaders assume that the most important things to focus on are the 
group they’ll be leading and how to manage it. Leadership courses start at 
the opposite end of the spectrum, however, by challenging leaders to study 
themselves instead. Good leadership requires good self-leadership, because 
unless you know yourself pretty well, you won’t be able to self-manage to the 
high degree needed to be effective.
The most important thing to know about yourself as a leader is what your 
approach looks and feels like to the people you lead. For starters, does your 
team think you’re an active, involved leader or a distant, uncaring one? This 
question gets at leadership volume, or the amount of leadership presence 
you provide.

52
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Often, you may think that you’re providing enough leadership when actually, 
you’re so busy with your own work that you aren’t present for your team, 
and they think you’re remote and unavailable. Be careful to keep the leadership 
volume turned up loud enough that your entire team can hear you. Don’t be 
so distant that team members aren’t sure whether they really have a leader!
 
The kinds of activities listed in Table 3-1 need to make up a large part of most 
of your days. Otherwise, your leadership won’t really be visible to the people 
you’re supposed to lead. I think the following expression is a great reminder: 
Leadership is action, not position.
Identifying your leadership orientation
It would be nice if all you had to do was get the volume (or amount of leader-
ship) right, but of course, it’s not that simple. You also need to know which 
of two fundamental orientations to use at any given time (and by the way, 
because they’re fundamental orientations, you need to be consistent in your 
use of one for some time instead of jumping erratically between them). 
To identify your basic leadership orientation, ask yourself the following 
questions:
 
1. Do I focus on doing things consistently and carefully?
 
2. Do I find routines boring and dull?
 
3. Do I take pride in perfecting my skills?
 
4. Do I get the most enjoyment out of trying new things?
 
5. Do I insist that employees and team members do things correctly?
 
6. Do I insist that employees and team members try new approaches?
The following sections explain what your answers to these questions indicate 
about your leadership orientation.
Maintenance orientation
If you answered yes to questions 1, 3, and 5, your default orientation is 
toward maintenance, and you’ll find yourself a natural for the strategic phase 
of efficient production. You’re probably particularly good at keeping a success-
ful business or operation going smoothly and well. This maintenance orienta-
tion will tend to reduce the amount of creative thinking and experimentation 
you do, however, and will make it more difficult for you to lead innovation 
and change. You’ll need to make a conscious effort to change your orienta-
tion to allow innovation to happen.

53
 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
Innovation orientation
If you answered yes to questions 2, 4, and 6, you probably didn’t answer yes 
to the others, because people usually favor one or the other orientation. 
Your orientation is creative, and your tendency is to look for new ideas and 
approaches. You ought to find it fairly easy and natural to adopt innovative 
leadership techniques and to inspire others to become more creative. Your 
weakness may be in persisting long enough with one idea to bring it fully 
through development and refine it into a profitable routine.
Can you master both orientations?
As I expect that you’ve already figured out, you need to be able to shift your 
orientation and not be stuck with just one approach. Knowing your basic 
orientation helps you understand not only your strengths, but also your 
weaknesses.
A maintenance-oriented leader is great at keeping things running smoothly 
and doesn’t get bored with the pursuit of efficiencies during scale-up, but he 
may tend to forget about creativity and fail to lead the way to the next big 
thing. Maintenance makes sense only as long as what you’re maintaining is 
worth it. At some point, you need to trade it in for a new model.
The innovation-oriented leader is a natural when it comes to finding the next 
great idea and working on it, but she begins to lose focus and get bored just 
when the innovation’s kinks are finally ironed out and it’s time to profit by 
using it efficiently.
Which is your strength: innovating or maintaining? Whichever it is, know your 
strongest and weakest qualities, and make a point of hiring people who can 
help you with both. I’m a natural innovator myself, but my business partner, 
Stephanie, has a maintenance orientation. She’s really good at making things 
hum along efficiently, and she keeps a close eye on plans and budgets, which 
means I can spend most of my time imagining. Sometimes, when her orienta-
tion fits the strategic phase we’re in, she takes the lead. At other times, I step 
forward (with a new product I’ve designed, for example) and take the lead as 
we change our product lineup or try a new business model. If it works, I turn 
the reins over to her to fine-tune it and make it run profitably.
I’ve found that I’m so strongly oriented toward innovation that it’s hard for 
me to change my own approach and be a good maintainer, so I rely on some-
one else to help me cover the other orientation. Most people are less extreme 
in their orientation, however, and can teach themselves to switch from 
one orientation to the other more easily than I can. It’s up to you to decide 
whether you can cover both basic leadership orientations yourself or you 
need a partner to help you.

54
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Zeroing in on your leadership style
Your leadership style is the approach you take toward the people and tasks 
involved in achieving your leadership goals. Everyone has a leadership style, 
but (just as with basic leadership orientation, discussed in the preceding sec-
tion) most people aren’t very aware of what their style is.
What leadership style do you seem to have in the eyes of your team mem-
bers? Do you delegate often — perhaps too often, because you’re too busy 
to help them figure out how to do their work? Do you tend to talk and think 
about the work itself, but ignore the humans who do it and their often all-too-
human problems and concerns? Or are you very empathetic and aware of 
people problems, but not very good at planning and structuring the work?
To find out what your leadership style is, consult Figure 3-2. It asks you two 
questions outside the four-box grid. These questions are called forced-choice 
questions because you have to pick one of the two possible answers. When 
you’ve chosen your two answers, go to the cell where they intersect on the 
grid, and read about the style that corresponds to your choices. There are 
four main leadership styles, and one of them probably is your default (the 
one you turn to most often):
 
✓ Instruct: You give an employee clear information about what to do and 
where, how, and why to do it. Then you make sure that you are available 
(or someone else who understands the work is available) to correct and 
answer questions.
 
✓ Coach: You assign projects or assignments that build on and develop 
employees’ skills while you provide both instruction and support to help 
the employees rise to the challenges you’ve set.
 
✓ Relate: You listen and use your empathy to understand what employees 
are concerned about and help them feel better about their work.
 
✓ Delegate: You recognize that an employee or team is ready to take on 
more responsibility, and you reduce your level of supervision and chal-
lenge that person or team to do larger projects independently.
Adjusting your style to fit the situation
The leadership grid in Figure 3-2 is the gold standard of leadership training 
because most experts agree that it’s important to learn to adjust your style 
to meet your team’s needs. Often, one person may need one style of leader-
ship, while another has a different need. When I run leadership workshops 
and retreats, I spend a good amount of time helping leaders practice adjust-
ing their style to different people and situations. You can work on this skill on 
your own by always remembering to ask what you think people’s task-structure 

55
 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
and human-support needs are and then picking the style that matches those 
needs, per the grid in Figure 3-2. In the next section, Table 3-2 provides more 
details about how to use each of the styles well.

Your leadership style is a really important factor to get a handle on, 
because you need to know what your default style is — the style you exhibit 
when you’re not really paying attention to leadership style. You also need 
to know how to use alternative styles and when it’s in the best interest of 
an employee or the entire team for you to switch to a different style.
Effective leadership often comes down to knowing which style to use when. 
After surveying the styles outlined in the preceding section, you may find 
that you’re instructive by nature. This default style enables you to explain 
an assignment clearly or to give clear, prompt performance feedback so 
people know how well they’re doing. But you need to recognize that people 
don’t always need instruction. Leadership is more than that. Sometimes, you 
need to switch styles and lend a considerate, empathetic ear; that’s what 
the Relate style is all about. At other times, the issue may be that someone 
is more than ready to be trusted with a more challenging assignment, so you 
need to switch to the Delegate style.
Coaching is a mix of instructing and relating. It’s both informational and 
supportive. When you coach, you put effort into helping the person feel good 
and try hard. You also put effort into designing the right tasks with a good 
level of challenge and supervising employees as they learn to master 
new challenges.

56
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Coaching is a great way to develop your team’s capabilities, but it’s a lot of 
work. You have to turn your leadership volume up higher than with the other 
three styles. So don’t feel like you have to coach all the time.
 
The reward for coaching well is that you eventually develop your team’s capa-
bilities to such a high level that you can delegate to the team and turn your 
leadership volume down even more — but not off, because you still have to 
stay in regular touch. A good reminder is to tell yourself, “Delegate, but 
don’t abdicate.”
Delegating is the ultimate goal of your developmental leadership, but when-
ever you introduce an innovation and need to get your team members up to 
speed on it, switch back to coaching until they’ve gotten the hang of it and 
you can delegate again.
 
It’s important to get good at the day-to-day leadership of people and their work, 
because that gives you and your team an edge when it comes to innovating. 
People work better, and have more energy and enthusiasm for creativity and 
change, when they have competent leadership. Without it, they worry and 
feel defensive about their work, and they aren’t open to change or willing to 
innovate. (If you want to take a leadership-style assessment and get more help 
with being an effective leader, visit www.tspectrum.com and purchase a 
copy of StratLead Self-Assessment, an inexpensive way to evaluate your 
leadership style.)
Adapting the classic styles 
for faster innovation
The classic leadership styles defined in Figure 3-2 — Instruct, Coach, 
Relate, and Delegate — are based on a model that came out of studies 
of well-established organizations, such as large factories, where change 
was gradual and most people weren’t actively engaged in innovation. As a 
result, the standard ways of thinking about leadership style tend to ignore 
creative and innovative leadership behaviors.
Table 3-2 shows how each of the four classic managerial leadership styles 
can be expressed as two different sets of leadership behaviors, depending on 
the orientation you need: conservative and maintenance-oriented or creative 
and innovation-oriented.
Try this metaphor on for size: Think of the basic leadership styles as ways of 
gardening. A focus on maintenance is like weeding, watering, and harvesting 
the garden, whereas a focus on innovation is like planting and developing 
new plant varieties.

Encourage creativity by role-
modeling right-brain activity 
and conversation. Seek unique 
perspectives, and invite each

thoughts and diverse experi-
ences, because these are 
good sources of fresh insight.
Delegational/

Review performance less 
frequently as people learn 
to be better self-managers. 
Give employees opportuni-

coming up with new ideas and 
approaches. Allow people to run 
with their ideas and see whether 
they can make them work. 
Empower project teams to test 
and develop worthy new ideas.
 
The most important thing to know about your leadership in terms of its 
impact is whether you’re maintenance- or innovation-oriented. Whether to 
orient yourself toward running the existing business efficiently (maintenance) 
or innovating effectively to change it (innovation) is the most fundamental 
decision you need to make whenever you find yourself in a leadership role.

Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Putting orientation and style together
As an innovative leader, you’ll often be asking your team to come up with or 
implement creative new ideas, solutions, or designs. Whatever each person’s 
specific duties are, everyone has one assignment in common: Contribute to 
the effort to innovate! Figure 3-3 is a diagnostic grid that you can use to figure 
out which style to use and how to use it to keep your team members innovat-
ing productively. Answer the two questions outside the four-box grid and 
then go to the cell where your answers intersect.
Figure 3-3 helps you get both your orientation and your leadership style correct, 
at least on the macro level (you may need to adjust style for specific people, 
however). As Figure 3-3 shows, you should delegate as a general style only 
when your entire team is flexible and eager to take on responsibility or when 
you’re ahead in the innovation game and can be efficiency-oriented for a 
while. Otherwise, you need to use one of the other three styles and turn up 
your leadership volume by putting more effort into communicating with and 
guiding your team.

 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
Developing Your Leadership Skills
Innovation is, by its very nature, taking a leadership role. You can’t innovate 
from the back of the pack. You have to be out in front in your thinking — and 
your doing — to make exciting new things happen. So the pursuit of leader-
ship skills and resources should always be on your personal agenda.
Seeking feedback
The most fundamental difference between great leaders and bad ones is that 
great leaders seek and welcome feedback. They ask questions like “How am I 
doing?” and “Is there anything else you need from me to do this project well?” 
Then they listen to the answer with an open mind and a smile, ask clarifying 
questions, thank the contributor for her feedback, and act on it right away. 
If you let them, your team members will help you become a better leader.
Working with a mentor
A mentor is someone with the experience, skills, and supportive attitude 
needed to help you figure out how to succeed. When someone offers to 
mentor you, it should feel like an honor. If nobody asks, you might try asking 
someone whether he’d be willing to mentor you. What’s involved? Meeting 
every now and then so your mentor can ask you how things are going, offer 
advice, and ask probing questions to help you figure out what to do next.
Mentors who have invented or implemented major innovations themselves 
are the best, because they already know the ropes and can give you advice 
born of real experience. If you aren’t familiar with how to work with a mentor 
or your mentor isn’t sure what’s involved, you might want to consult an 
inexpensive booklet and assessment tool I wrote called Mentoring for Success 
(published by Trainer’s Spectrum; see www.tspectrum.com/mentoring_
success.htm). I highly recommend finding a mentor who has innovation 
experience and can help you by giving you sage advice and encouragement 
throughout your career as an innovative leader.
Seeking varied leadership experiences
Mentors are very important to success as an innovator, because they contrib-
ute the benefit of their experience. As the old saying goes, however, there’s 
no real substitute for your own experience. If you want to be a successful 
innovator and an effective leader, make a point of trying a wide range of roles 
and assignments. Don’t typecast yourself.

60
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Even if your technical or professional knowledge is fairly narrow, go ahead 
and try your hand at leading a professional team or volunteer project outside 
your specialty. The experience will definitely enhance your innovation and 
leadership skills. In fact, the experiences that take you far from your comfort 
zones are always the most meaningful in hindsight. Don’t be afraid to try new 
things! After all, this is exactly the kind of courage you’ll need to give your 
team when you lead the way toward innovation, so you’d better have plenty 
of creative courage of your own.
Managing the risks of innovation
Innovation entails risk. After all, the majority of new ideas fail to come to 
fruition. As you push ahead, full of enthusiasm, you may discover that an idea 
isn’t as practical as you first thought, or perhaps someone else is developing 
a competing approach or design that will prove even better than yours.
So is innovation worth the risk of failure? Actually, yes. If you don’t innovate 
at all, you’re bound to fail. Your failure may be gradual, but you can be sure 
that you’ll become increasingly out-of-date, and being out-of-date is what 
dooms businesses to bankruptcy and people to unemployment.
 
You run a risk of failure when you do nothing at all. The goal of innovation is 
to improve over that baseline risk. Without innovation, you’ll gradually fall out 
of style or out-of-date. With innovation, you have an improved chance of stay-
ing up-to-date and also a chance of getting ahead of the pack!
As a leader with an innovative vision, you need to be alert to a wide range of 
risks, and ready to duck and weave to avoid them should they come up in 
your firm:
 
✓ Technological changes can blindside you, so keep an eye on technology. 
Assign several people (or more, if you can) the duty of staying up-to-date 
on major advances in your own industry or field and in any others that 
might share underlying technologies.
 
✓ Financial investments can turn into risky gambles if a development 
project proves to be costly. Many good inventions drive their founder 
out of business before some bigger company with deeper 
pockets picks them up and makes a success of them. Ouch! Be careful 
to scale your investments appropriately. It’s a mistake to risk so much 
on a new product that failure could drive you out of business. If you can, 
scale the initial launch down to a level of risk you can manage; if not, 
find a bigger partner to help.

61
 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
 
✓ Protect your ideas as much as is practical. The longer you can keep 
others from imitating your invention, the more profitable it will prove to 
be. (See Chapter 17 for how-to advice.)
 
✓ Manage your business tightly and well. Your ability to weather the 
risks of the innovation phase of your business strategy is determined in 
large part by the strength of the last efficiency phase, where you had the 
chance to profit from a stable business for a while. During this profitable 
period, you need to save up reserves for when you’ll need them in the 
next major innovation effort.
Knowing that you’ll need to reinvent your business formula gives you the 
foresight to build your own war chest of useful assets — including financial 
savings, valuable assets such as buildings that can be resold, expensive 
equipment needed in R&D (that’s business-speak for research and develop-
ment), savvy staff trained in new technologies, and helpful business relation-
ships with other leading innovators — to get you through a major change.
Projecting a Positive Attitude
If you started at the beginning of this chapter and are feeling a little intimi-
dated by all the talk of leadership skills and actions, take heart. There’s one 
thing you can do that I guarantee will make up for a lot of errors or missteps 
in every other aspect of your leadership. Leaders who maintain a strongly 
optimistic and positive frame of mind are able to build and maintain inno-
vative momentum, even when things go wrong. It turns out that a realistic 
optimist is far better at stimulating creative behavior or at leading a team 
through a tough implementation than any other kind of leader!
There’s a lot of research supporting the importance of optimism at work. 
It’s actually one of the few things that most experts agree on. Optimists are 
more creative and innovative, more motivated, and more satisfied with their 
work. They also live longer, healthier, happier, and more successful lives. 
Entrepreneurs need to be reasonably optimistic to succeed.
Keep in mind, however, that optimism can be taken too far. At its extreme, 
optimism can produce overconfidence and a lack of realism. Your goal 
should be to be realistically optimistic, with a positive, can-do attitude but 
also willingness to admit that a strategy isn’t working and to change direc-
tions if need be!

62
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Expressing both hopefulness and optimism
Before I get into the specifics of how to add optimism to your leadership 
approach, I need to mention that researchers sometimes distinguish between 
hopefulness and optimism. Why? Well, hopefulness is indicated by a generally 
positive attitude about the future. If you believe that you’ll somehow come 
up with creative solutions to any major problems that get in your way, that’s 
termed hopefulness. It’s good — just as good as optimism, which has a more 
specific definition.
Optimism is defined as taking personal ownership of good events (“My leader-
ship helped the team find a new way to market our products,” for example). 
It goes along with the opposite approach to bad events. Instead of taking the 
blame for them, optimists tend to say things like “Our first two attempts to 
bring our products into new markets failed because luck just wasn’t with us 
and our timing was off.”
Probably the literal truth is somewhere in the middle: You deserve some of 
the credit for a good event and some of the blame for a bad event. But if you 
emphasize blaming yourself for bad things and avoid taking any credit for 
good things, you’ll be debilitated by the belief that you aren’t likely to succeed. 
You can improve your self-talk by focusing on evidence from past experi-
ences that encourages you to try again. When you make a habit of talking in 
positive ways about the past, you not only convince yourself that you can 
make good things happen in the future, but also convince your team 
members that they can be successful innovators.
Being pragmatically creative
It’s important to aim for a positive attitude that supports innovation, so you 
may want to think about what that means for you. A pragmatic approach to 
optimism may be your best bet. Don’t just say, “Oh, it’s okay; we don’t have 
to do anything; things will get better on their own.” That’s an unrealistically 
optimistic view and goes along with feelings of personal lack or responsibility 
and even helplessness. A pragmatic optimist says, “Things don’t look so good 
right now, but I’ll bet we can figure out a good way to deal with this problem 
and even find some hidden opportunities in it.”
Going for that positive ripple effect
When you’re in a positive (optimistic and hopeful) frame of mind, you tend 
to spread that positive attitude to others. It spreads quite naturally, both 
through what you say and through the way you act. Positive statements 
indicate that you’re

63
 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
 
✓ Hopeful about finding solutions to problems
 
✓ Enthusiastic about the possibility of discovering, creating, or inventing 
something new
 
✓ Open to ideas and options and interested in learning something new
Positive people express their optimism through their body language. They have
 
✓ A buoyant stride and energetic movements
 
✓ An open, relaxed posture
 
✓ An interested facial expression when others are making suggestions
If you find it hard to sound and act like an irrepressible optimist, you may 
need to revitalize your own attitude before you go around sharing it with 
others. It’s a happy fact of leadership that you have an obligation to be in a 
positive, energetic frame of mind.
Take the time to figure out what rituals and lifestyle changes you need to 
make to come to work each day full of optimism and energy so that you can 
naturally role-model and spark that kind of energy for your whole team. 
Adopt an exercise regime during lunch hour, for example, if it gives you 
positive energy.
On days when optimism just isn’t there, and you feel down, stay away from 
your team if at all possible. Go out and recharge yourself before you interact 
with your team members so as not to contaminate their attitudes. The leader’s 
attitude spreads more powerfully and rapidly than anyone else’s, so take 
advantage of the leverage your attitude has over other people — and please 
don’t make the all-too-common mistake of amplifying your bad mood by 
sharing it at work!
Putting All Your Leadership 
Skills Together
Figure 3-4 uses the metaphor of a house to show what it looks like when you 
put your leadership house in order. It begins with the foundation, which is 
your attitude — the positive, hopeful feelings that you spread to give your 
team the energy and enthusiasm it needs to persist in the pursuit of a 
successful innovation (see question A in Figure 3-4).

64
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
The interior of the house, where you and your team dwell every workday, 
is defined by the support and structure you provide as a leader who under-
stands the effective use of the Instruct, Coach, Relate, and Delegate styles 
(see question B in Figure 3-4).
The roof, which provides an overarching purpose and direction to your 
team’s work, is sustained by the vision of the future you articulate as an 
innovative leader (see question C in Figure 3-4). Notice that I’ve divided the 
roof into three possibilities to reflect three main options for your leadership 
vision. You may choose to
 
✓ Discover the next big innovation (appropriate to the innovation phase of 
your business’s strategic cycle).
 
✓ Focus on implementing it efficiently (appropriate to the efficiency phase 
of your business’s cycle).
 
✓ Problem-solve if something comes up to interrupt one of the preceding 
(appropriate when a major new threat arises and you have to change 
direction to cope with it).

 Chapter 3: Leading with Creative Vision
That’s pretty much it. Innovative leadership can be summed up with this 
simple diagram. It means that you need to integrate three levels of leadership. 
On the fundamental, emotional level, you need to keep your team energized 
with a positive, optimistic attitude. On the practical level of daily work, you 
need to provide clear instructions, along with the right level of support to keep 
people feeling challenged and interested in their work. Finally, on the highest 
level, you need to periodically remind everyone of why you’re all working so 
hard — because of the excitement of trying to grow larger, do better, or over-
come some major obstacle and achieve your vision of a better future.

Chapter 4
Innovating in Sales and Marketing
In This Chapter
▶ Gaining competitive advantage by breaking unwritten rules
▶ Taking steps to ensure creativity throughout the marketing process
▶ Finding creative advantage in all five main marketing areas
C
reativity in marketing means wild or crazy advertising to most people. 
That’s not really what I have in mind in this chapter, although some-
times a creative ad, Web page, or sales presentation is just what you need to 
grab attention and close a tough sale. But really, there are many more funda-
mental and important places where you need to innovate as a salesperson or 
marketer. Creativity often matters most and makes the most impact in ways 
that are subtle or even invisible to the average customer.
This chapter helps you find ways to innovate in sales and marketing so as 
to gain share and make history in your market. You start your break from 
the pack by finding creative ways to violate the norms of your industry and 
market. The chapter also helps you develop a creative approach to sales 
and marketing by working on a creative brief and identifying your creative 
advantage.
Making an Inconspicuous 
but Powerful Impact
Creative marketing is virtually impossible to spot unless you’re a real expert, 
but it has more impact than any other kind of marketing does. A creative 
strategy might be as simple as deciding to focus on a different type of product 
from your more traditional competitors.

68
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Your marketing strategy can get creative in the way that it talks about 
benefits — the things that the product does for or gives to the user. If most 
of your competitors design products and write ads with one benefit in mind, 
you can try to redefine the market by focusing on another benefit. Quality 
may trump style, for example. Or maybe you’ll choose to emphasize reliability 
over speed or cost over service.
 
Consider the example of Under Armour, now a successful marketer of athletic 
apparel, but just a few years ago, the company was seeking U.S. Small Business 
Association funding and struggling to launch a new business. Its concept was 
to make a tight-fitting, moisture-wicking T-shirt for high-performance sports. 
The product strategy was innovative because leading sports-apparel compa-
nies focused on the outerwear, not the underwear.
Under Armour sells mostly on the basis of performance. Its clothing really 
does wick sweat away and helps you stay cool, thereby helping you perform 
better. Major sports-apparel brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma compete as 
much on the basis of fashion as performance. In fact, 90 percent of sports 
apparel is sold to people who don’t wear it for its intended use and therefore 
are buying it for fashion reasons. So Under Armour’s approach is radical in 
the sense that it goes back to the roots of its industry by selling clothing to 
people who are looking to perform better, not just to look fashionable.
Because it had a performance edge, Under Armour was able to price rela-
tively high and avoid deep discounting. As competitors rushed to offer similar 
products, Under Armour faced more price competition, but it responded 
by continuing to innovate. Right now, the company is marketing a new line 
of mouth guards that prevent jaw clenching and therefore save energy for 
athletic performance. Offering something that customers can slip into their 
mouths that will actually make them stronger is a creative idea. Under 
Armour is an upstart, but so far, its continuing innovation has helped it gain 
share from giant rivals. It will be interesting to see whether it can continue to 
be a market innovator — and continue to outsmart the Goliaths that compete 
against it.
Assessing (And Violating) the Norms
Many innovations take place in, or need to be communicated through, the 
sales and marketing functions. In fact, marketing is driven by innovation. 
You have to refresh your advertising, Web strategy, and product offerings 
continually, or you’ll soon be left behind by more innovative competitors. 
This chapter shows you how to effectively innovate your approach to sales 
and marketing to boost visibility and impact for your campaign.

69
 Chapter 4: Innovating in Sales and Marketing
Finding abnormal ways to 
accomplish your goals
Marketing arose, in point of fact, as a creative way to avoid having to make 
personal sales calls to sell something. It costs less to sell something by mail or 
on the Web than in person. You may be able to continue this trend by finding 
new ways to cut the costs of sales and marketing activities without hurting 
the results! Are sales calls the norm now in your industry? If so, can you find 
a way to eliminate them? You might decide to combine a richly informative 
Web site with excellent tech support via e-mail and phone, plus a library of 
short streaming videos on your site or on YouTube (www.youtube.com) to 
take the place of traditional face-to-face sales and support.
Alternatively, if there’s no personal selling in your industry right now, you 
could be the first to reach out and shake your prospects’ and customers’ 
hands. The point is to do something different. Innovators attract attention in 
marketing. Copycats don’t.
Communicating in a different way
A great way to violate the norms is to advertise in a medium that none of 
your competitors uses. Radio has been abandoned by many marketers, so 
maybe you could do a fun retro radio ad with old-fashioned sound effects and 
a campy voice-over. Or how about being the first in your industry to pull out 
of the traditional (and probably expensive) trade shows and sell business to 
business (B2B) exclusively over the Web? Maybe you can do something 
simpler, like making a how-to video that you give away for free on YouTube. 
The point is, if you communicate in a novel way, your message is more likely 
to stand out from all the rest.
Violating social norms on purpose
Sometimes, the norms you face aren’t business norms (like how to distribute 
or advertise); rather, they’re more fundamental norms. Social norms are the 
rules within a society about how to conduct yourself. They dictate, among 
other things, these rules for display of emotions:
 
✓ Which emotions are considered good and bad
 
✓ How you’re supposed to feel in a particular situation
 
✓ How you should act when you experience a certain emotion

70
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Think about the power of those unwritten emotional rules. If you display 
anger in a public setting in Japan, you’ll be frowned upon and probably won’t 
close your deal. If you don’t get angry when your sports team loses in the 
United States, people will think you don’t care. Different emotional rules 
apply in different cultural settings. Now, what happens when you 
intentionally build a violation of an emotional rule into, say, a TV ad 
or a Candid Camera–style YouTube video?
 
Whenever you violate an unwritten rule about appropriate emotional expres-
sions, you attract a lot of attention. A whole lot. Somebody having a meltdown 
in the middle of the mall will be noticed by every single person in that mall. 
So if you want to create an attention-grabbing ad, consider a script or story 
line involving someone who violates an emotional rule — someone who’s 
too angry, happy, or even depressed. Drug companies have learned that if 
they run TV ads showing people who look really, really sad, they get a lot of 
viewers and strong recall of the ads, which works great for depression medi-
cations. But if you want to sell something to happy people, show someone 
over-the-top happy — irrationally, inappropriately happy. Violating the social 
norm guarantees memorability.
Avoiding the cost of a sales call
If you rely at least partially on a sales force or sales representatives, you’re 
giving away between 10 percent and 20 percent of each sale to pay for people 
to wear out shoe leather on your behalf. Salespeople are key to making com-
plex sales when their expertise is used to select the right items or design the 
right service program. In many cases, however, you can create a Web site 
that explains the options and presents the choices to customers more clearly 
than all but the best of your salespeople can do. It’s hard on salespeople but 
easy on your budget to reduce the use of sales calls and substitute an expert-
system Web site instead.
In addition to providing information and advice, salespeople remind customers 
to place orders. Showing up with samples and order forms is a good way to 
get the attention of a store buyer or a purchasing agent at a company. But 
you can often substitute a mix of e-mail links to new Web catalogs, traditional 
mailings of catalogs and sales fliers, telephone calls, and other arm’s-length 
communications.
 
A good rule of thumb is to substitute three or more arm’s-length communica-
tions for one sales call to have equal impact. If sales aren’t sufficient, add two 
or three more arm’s-length contacts. A regular B2B customer may need to be 
reached by e-mail, mail, or phone once every week or two throughout the year.

71
 Chapter 4: Innovating in Sales and Marketing
Committing to a Creative Approach
It’s easy to keep doing pretty much what you’ve done in the past. Even when 
you print a new catalog or run a new ad campaign, it may in truth be very 
similar to the last one. Are you truly innovating?
 
Researchers find that successful innovators do one thing more than other 
people do: They decide to be creative. The decision to seek a creative approach 
is the first and most vital step in innovation. So please repeat after me: “We 
will be innovative in our approach to marketing.” Good! Now start looking for 
your next creative breakthrough.
To inspire you, Figure 4-1 is an interesting example of a creative sales and 
marketing approach. You can see what appears at first glance to be a large 
billboard or maybe a mural. Actually, it’s a reverse mural, made by cleaning 
the grime off the cement wall of an underpass. The unusual ad was created 
with the product it advertises: Green Works, a natural but (obviously) power-
ful cleaner made by The Clorox Co.
 
Figure 4-1: 
A mural

A creative ad campaign is just one of the ways you can innovate in sales and 
marketing. Many of the most successful innovations involve the product itself.
 
What do you do with your patio furniture when you’re not using it? The 
furniture company JANUS et Cie created the Obelisk, a modernist sculptural 
thingy that sits elegantly in a corner, looking like an alien might hatch out of 
it. Rather than an alien, it hatches fancy outdoor armchairs and a table. The 
design is a combination of sculpture and furniture. (Chapter 11 explores the 
power of creative combinations; check it out to come up with clever designs 
of your own!)

72
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
You probably haven’t seen the Obelisk on a friend’s deck or patio because 
it’s quite expensive, but if the concept is good, other furniture makers will 
probably create knockoffs by using less expensive materials and variations 
on the original form. (See Chapter 10 for details on how to safely modify 
innovative concepts and introduce them in versions of your own.)
Writing your creative brief
A creative brief is a written description of the target customer and the desired 
behavior you want to stimulate in that customer, as well as any background 
information and concepts or ideas that might help the creative department of 
an ad agency come up with something that will do the trick.
The creative brief was developed to help give informational support, creative 
insight, and strategic context to the writers of ad copy, but it can be applied 
more broadly than that. You can also use it to help focus the creative design 
efforts of product developers, packagers, and other members of the marketing 
team or to help your sales representatives design a winning trade-show 
booth. It’s also very helpful as a starting point for Web-page design, product-
demo videos, and really almost anything else you may do in marketing.
The creative brief helps give focus and momentum to the creative process. 
Keep it brief enough to review easily during writing or design (three to ten 
pages). Here are the components of a good general format that you can use 
when writing one:
 
1. The strategic playing field: Describe your current position in the 
market, major competitors, trends, and opportunities. Use a SWOT 
analysis (that’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the 
market), and show a perceptual map (a graph laying competitors out on 
two major dimensions of customer attitude, such as economical versus 
expensive or rugged versus stylish). Then summarize the strategic situ-
ation. You might say, “Upscale homeowners are looking for innovations 
in patio and deck furnishings, but the market is surprisingly traditional, 
which gives us an opportunity to innovate.”
 
2. Your target customer’s profile: Describe the users of your product as 
specifically as possible, including not only who they are, but also how 
they think and feel about the product when buying and using it. Include a 
profile of a target customer and even a photo, if you can find an appropri-
ate one. You might show a well-dressed, successful-looking middle-aged 
couple standing on a large deck behind a gorgeous suburban house.
 
3. Your goal: Describe what you want your creative work to accomplish in 
customer behavior (such as what they will buy, when, and how). Your 
goal might be “Convince condo owners with small decks that they need 
compact sculptural stacks of deck furniture.”

73
 Chapter 4: Innovating in Sales and Marketing
 
4. Your message: Very simply, in a single sentence, state what you want to 
communicate to target customers (see Step 2) to get them to buy (see 
Step 3). Your message might be “Clean, handy, and elegantly stored in 
plain sight — all the furniture needed to stage a deck party or watch the 
sunset with your special someone.”
 
5. Creative input: This includes any interesting tidbits of information or 
suggestions that might help the creative process, such as quotes from 
prospective customers or fun facts, and several starting ideas that might 
lead to even better ones with some work. You might include pictures 
of NASA-designed compact seats and engineering specifications on the 
durability of high-tensile molded plastic furniture in outdoor settings.
 
6. Schedule and constraints: What’s needed, and when do you need it? 
Here’s where you summarize the business side of the project and 
identify specific outputs (such as a brochure for retailers to use, a point-
of-purchase display, an educational video, or a Web-page design). Also 
identify any constraints, such as budget limitations, that need to be 
considered when evaluating creative ideas. You might mention that 
market research established a limit to what your target customer is 
willing to pay for porch and patio furniture.
Your creative brief helps stimulate creative thinking and also channels it 
toward a specific business goal. In other words, it ensures productive inno-
vation in marketing. (For help deciding who should work on the project and 
how to get your team to generate good ideas, see Chapter 6.)
Coming up with the first 
round of creative ideas
It’s never too soon to use your imagination! As you work on a creative brief 
(refer to the preceding section) or just generally think about how to innovate 
in marketing, try to generate some ideas. Good or bad, they’re all helpful 
because one idea always leads to another.
Consult the chapters in Part II for help in coming up with creative ideas, or 
just start jotting down your ideas now. Remember that when you violate 
a marketing or general social norm (on purpose), you often come up with 
something that has impact and stimulates interest.
Following is a warm-up exercise that involves generating a creative starting 
point for a new ad campaign. It will get your imagination working so that you 
can turn to your own business next.

74
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
In the United States, most automobile advertising is done by two very different 
types of businesses: major international auto manufacturers and local auto 
dealerships. Creative — and expensive — brand-building ads come from the 
manufacturers. Campy, unprofessional ads lacking creativity come from the 
dealerships, which always focus on getting warm bodies into their show-
rooms. Switch things up by trying to generate creative and fun (but not overly 
expensive) ads for local dealerships. By changing the style, you may be able to 
attract attention to the local dealership and break it out of the pack.
If you come up empty-handed at first (that is, you have no creative ideas 
for local-auto-dealership advertising), try working from a visual stimulus. 
Sometimes, that’s a big help. Take a look at the fanciful photographic compo-
sition in Figure 4-2, and see whether you can write an appropriate caption for 
it. (The caption can be humorous, if you like.)
 
Figure 4-2:

make this 
image into 
an ad for

dealership.
 
 
Using a visual image to stimulate your imagination is a good general technique 
for marketing and advertising, and you can easily adapt it to any creative 
campaign. Just select several interesting images that initially don’t seem to be 
directly relevant to your product or purpose; then force yourself to write 
explanations or captions that make the images relevant. Your imagination will 
bridge the gap, and in the process, you may get a good creative idea that you 
can develop more fully later.

 Chapter 4: Innovating in Sales and Marketing
What did you come up with for Figure 4-2? Did you write a good caption to 
relate the image to a local auto dealership so that it could be used in the 
dealership’s advertising? Good work! Here are a few ideas I came up with:
 
✓ Landing soon at a dealership near you . . .
 
✓ NASA reports the arrival of indisputable proof that there is advanced 
intelligence on other planets . . .
 
✓ The car of your dreams . . .
Each idea could be combined with the image in Figure 4-2 to create a print ad 
in a local newspaper. Or you could take one idea as a starting point for a creative 
process and build a full campaign around it. You could design a “Car of Your 
Dreams” campaign in which television spot ads, radio ads, and a longer 
YouTube video explore variations on the theme of how customers dream 
about their new cars — and, of course, how the local dealership makes those 
dreams come to life! To reinforce the message, the dealership could give out 
luxurious down pillows along with the new cars.
The overall title of the campaign could be “Coming soon to a dream near 
you!” Of course, dreams aren’t “near” you the way that movie theaters (the 
originators of that phrase) are; they’re in you. But in bending the old saying 
by substituting dreams for movies, you remind people that a local event is 
happening — the car of their dreams is appearing — and that they can come 
into the showroom to see it. The creative concept for this ad campaign fits 
the goals of an auto dealership’s advertising, and it’s also clever and different 
enough to attract curiosity and attention.
Narrowing Your Focus to Find Sources 
of Creative Advantage
It’s a lot easier to generate useful, creative ideas when you have a narrow, 
specific focus. In marketing, a great way to drill down to specific areas is to 
work within the Five Ps framework:
 
✓ Product: Innovate to offer a better product through design, technology, 
packaging, or other product-related innovations. If you can’t afford to 
invent the next hot product, be on the lookout for it, and become a 
reseller or licenser as soon as it appears — or, even better, try to think 
of new applications for your existing product that customers might find 
appealing.
 
✓ Pricing: Find ways to drive your costs down and offer a lower price, or 
explore creative ways to take some of the sting out of buying, such as 
by offering loyalty programs, layaway, innovative warranties, or other 
price-based incentives.

76
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
 
✓ Placement: Distribute your product in helpful new ways (via the 
Internet, for example), and make it easier for people to get what they 
want when they want it. Consider placing your product in stores or 
catalogs where it hasn’t traditionally been sold. Distribution is the 
easiest way to score a creative home run.
 
✓ Promotion: Find clever, attention-grabbing ways to communicate with 
potential buyers and build the luster of your brand. Use unusual media 
or message formats. If everyone else is running serious ads, hire a 
comedian as your spokesperson, but if competitors try to entertain, 
switch it up with hard-hitting factual ads or exposés showing what’s 
wrong with their products.
 
✓ People: Engage free help through social networking by getting people 
talking about your brand, or create a fresh sales and service model to 
make your company stand out. You may even decide to buck the trend 
and be the only company in your market that offers easily accessible 
sales and service people to help customers.
By making the rounds of the Five Ps, you make sure that you’ve considered 
a wide range of options for creative marketing. Don’t let your marketing pro-
gram stand still! You need forward momentum to make a business or brand a 
success, and creativity provides the energy for building that vital momentum.
Figure 4-3 shows the way that creativity works to surprise and please customers 
with unexpected benefits.

 Chapter 4: Innovating in Sales and Marketing
Your core offering is (I hope!) roughly on par with all your competitors’ 
offerings and is what’s expected of you. You have a good product that you 
distribute, promote, price, and support in much the way that others do. 
You’re in the game. Good! But that’s not good enough; doing what’s expected 
may keep you in the game but will never win it. To gain share and boost 
profits, you have to do something new, something that’s a happy surprise for 
your customers — or maybe for your competitors’ customers, who will defect 
and come over to your side!

A
 strategist is someone who thinks strategically, and in business, that 
usually means doing some strategic planning. A strategic plan (yes, I do 
need to get my terms clear) is an intelligent, high-level description of how 
you intend for your business to do better in the future.
Typically, strategic plans set the stage with broad-brush approaches that 
reach out several years into the future. Then business plans clarify exactly 
how this year’s operations will be budgeted and run so as to move in the 
intended strategic direction. That said, I can simplify what it means to be a 
strategist by saying that a strategist looks ahead and thinks about how to 
win big in the future. Usually, seeing a big win in the future requires some 
strategic vision, which arises from a combination of your knowledge and 
your creativity.
Winning strategies don’t just fall in your lap. They require thoughtful analysis 
of the current situation, including your strengths and weaknesses and an 
analysis of your competitors, industry, technologies, and trends in your 
marketplace. As a strategist, you start by getting to know the playing field 
really well.
Next, you cast about for big-picture ideas that can lead to success in the 
future. Where do those ideas for future success come from? Sometimes, 
purely from your imagination; at other times, from observing a successful 
strategy in another industry and adapting it to yours. Sometimes, success 
comes from forming a partnership (or strategic alliance) with the right company 
so as to be able to do something exciting and new that neither company 
could do before.

80
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
There are lots of ways to make a splash as an innovative strategist. This 
chapter shows you how to leverage your strategic thinking into future success.
Thinking Big by Planning to 
Re-create Your Business
Some strategists don’t take an innovative approach. They tend to project the 
future from what happened in the past. That’s boring unless you happen to 
be the undisputed leader in a monopolistic, protected market. I don’t think 
you can make that claim, so in this chapter, I assume that you need to inno-
vate to achieve a significant jump in performance and success.
The basic strategic question you should ask, whether you own the business 
or just work in it, is “What’s the best way to transform this business into 
something new, exciting, and better?” Think about how you can re-create 
the business, not just run it or work in it. The change in perspective that this 
question creates is powerful and often leads to helpful strategic insights.
Shifting from more of the same 
to creative planning
Do you do budgeting and planning? Most organizations do. However, the plans 
are usually based on last year, with minor modifications made to reflect obvi-
ous changes. That’s not the way to come up with a breakthrough. Before you 
plan, stop to imagine ways to innovate in your basic approach, such as these:
 
✓ Expanding into new geographic areas
 
✓ Pursuing new types of customers
 
✓ Improving or adding to your product line
 
✓ Introducing a new technology or invention
 
✓ Partnering with one or more other organizations to do something you 
can’t do by yourself
 
✓ Dramatically reducing your costs or turnaround times by innovating 
how you source or produce your products or services
 
✓ Distributing in new ways to save money, increase market coverage, or 
provide greater ease and availability of purchase
 
✓ Updating or replacing your brand name with something more dynamic

81
 Chapter 5: Being an Innovative Strategist
Without strategies such as these, your organization won’t grow significantly, 
and it probably will start to atrophy as things degenerate into a lifeless routine 
and the business slowly becomes out-of-date.
Including a mix of traditional and creative 
elements in your planning
Most organizations write a budget every year, and many of them also write 
up a business plan specifying who’s going to work on what. Major lines 
of business get their own sections, with a situation analysis (including 
strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities) and plans about what to 
do next.
People who do a lot of planning do so because they like to work from plans. 
They’re logical, careful people, and their plans make them feel more confi-
dent and provide the reassurance of a logical, well-organized approach. But 
keep in mind that the world isn’t all that predictable, and successful innova-
tions certainly aren’t. So planning needs to include some creative elements 
along with the traditional organized and logical parts.
 
Include some brainstorming about possible future strategies and ideas. Take 
time to look at what the newest upstarts are doing, not only in your own 
industry, but also in other industries. Scan the advances in technology to see 
whether new materials, equipment, or processes may be coming into your 
industry soon.
When should you do your creative research and thinking? Early in your plan-
ning process. As early as possible. Otherwise, you’ll get caught in the details 
of updating last year’s budget and won’t consider big-picture possibilities 
and fresh new ideas.
 
I recommend bringing a diverse group of between 7 and 14 people together for a 
half day or more of brainstorming about your business and its future strategy. 
Call it blue-sky brainstorming, or better yet, blue-water. Blue-water strategy is 
based on the idea that most businesses and brands compete head-to-head in 
crowded strategic waters that are red from the blood of their struggles against 
one another. However, research shows that the most successful businesses 
avoid direct competition and pick an unusual strategy that moves them out 
into a relatively competition-free area of so-called blue water. They innovate 
rather than imitate. Their success is determined by their degree of unique-
ness. (A 2005 article in Harvard Business Review by W. Kim and R. Mauborgne 
explored this concept, using the term blue ocean strategy to describe it, and I 
recommend it as good background reading.)

82
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
The proven advantage of blue-water strategies is the reason you need to 
include plenty of creative thinking in your planning. If you don’t, you’re 
guaranteed to continue doing the predictable, and you’ll face growing 
competition as the pack does the same. I’d much rather be the first company 
to have introduced a good memory-foam mattress, for example, than one of the 
remaining companies fighting to sell traditional mattresses. Wouldn’t you?
Ensuring a Healthy Strategic Cycle
Businesses, and in fact all organizations, ought to cycle between two distinct 
strategic phases:
 
✓ Efficient production phase: You scale up and get good at doing the 
same thing consistently.
 
✓ Creative searching phase: You experiment and search for the next big 
thing to scale up.
Figure 5-1 shows how this innovation cycle works and is helpful in under-
standing where success comes from. Assuming that you’re in a for-profit 
business, your main measure of success is profits. That’s the solid line that 
curves across the top part of the figure. What drives profits? The most impor-
tant determinant of profits in the long run is having something fresh and 
appealing to sell to your customers. That requires innovation. This is why 
the strategic phase has to shift from efficient product to creative searching 
before you max out the old innovations and start losing money. The dotted 
line in Figure 5-1 shows how you need to shift your attention (as an executive 
or planner and also throughout the organization).
 
At any one point in time, most of the organization should be doing just one of 
three things: producing efficiently, searching for the next big innovation, or 
transitioning quickly between these two phases.

 Chapter 5: Being an Innovative Strategist
Phase-shifting in strategic time
There’s a big difference between efficient production and creative searching. 
Behaviors and attitudes are just about opposites. That’s why the transitions 
between these phases are important. You need to recognize when the time 
has come to start seeking the next big strategic move and get creative. That’s 
a strategic decision. It involves recognizing that you need to innovate and 
then committing time, energy, and perhaps people and money to the quest.
How do you shift from efficient production to creativity? You have to look up 
and around for fresh ideas and opportunities, and you have to look within for 
imaginative ideas. If you run a small business, much of the responsibility for 
expanding your imaginative horizons falls on your shoulders. If you have a 
larger group, responsibility can be shared more easily. Here are three good 
ways to get an entire group or organization to shift between strategic phases:
 
✓ Use a strategic planning session to signal the beginning of a creative 
searching phase and take a needed break from nose-to-the-grindstone 
production. Invite as many people into your planning discussions as 
you can. Run brainstorming sessions (see Chapter 6), which are open-
minded and free in their form and style compared with normal staff 
meetings.
 
✓ Use a suggestion box or e-mail a request for ideas. Solicit ideas about 
anything and everything. Open the conversation with your staff by 
posing big-picture questions like “What do we want to be when we grow 
up?” to get people thinking creatively about the future.
 
✓ Use yourself as an example, if you’re the leader, to show people 
what’s expected of them: efficient production or creative searching 
for new strategies. Be clear on which one should be the priority so you 
can role-model the appropriate behavior. When necessary, transition as 
promptly and decisively as you can so it’s obvious to all watching you 
that the phase has shifted again.
Influencing strategy from the bottom up
What if you’re not in charge of the organization? Can you still help make sure 
that you’re in the right strategic phase? Maybe. Start by talking with your 
managers about strategic phases and the need for periodic new directions. 
Ask whether your leadership is open to the idea and wants help coming up 
with new strategies. If so, ask for some time and permission to brainstorm 
freely with a small group about what new directions the organization could take.
 
If you volunteer to do some good strategic imagining and then report your 
findings to management, you may find that your initiative and vision end up 
driving future strategy. You don’t have to be in charge to lead. You just have 
to have creative vision!

Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Investing in a Family of Innovations
A portfolio is a carefully selected group of assets you hold on to because you 
hope that they (or at least some of them) will benefit you in the future. You 
can have a portfolio of stocks and bonds in your investment account. With 
wise selection and appropriate diversity, the portfolio will grow in value and 
enrich you in the future. You can and should have a portfolio of products you 
sell (see the section “Managing Your Product Portfolio,” later in the chapter, 
for details). But first of all, you need a portfolio of innovative ideas and proj-
ects, from which will spring tomorrow’s winning products, processes, strate-
gies, and so forth.
Your business needs a portfolio of innovations to enrich it in the future. 
Why? Sadly, you can’t be certain of the future success of any idea or invention. 
Innovations have a risk of failure and a chance of success. They also have a 
life span. What was new and hot (and profitable) a few years ago is not today. 
A portfolio of innovations ensures a regular flow of new ones, some of which 
are going to be successful.
Figure 5-2 shows how the proportions of new products, projects, or other 
innovations usually fall out, assuming that you’re right about the success of 
any innovation only half the time (it’s like flipping a coin). At any one time, 
you’ve got a batch of new ideas and projects you’re developing, shown in the 
figure as the first third of the pie.
If you assume that half of all innovations succeed, a third of the pie chart in 
Figure 5-2 represents your new crop of innovations, and a third represents 
the successful and profitable ones from your last crop. The final third is 
made up of the unsuccessful ones from previous rounds of innovation. It’s 
not always obvious that they’re failures, so they tend to linger in the budget 
and in your lineup for a while, parasitically slurping up a third of your 
resources. Keep reading to find out how to avoid this mistake.
Being tough on underperforming 
projects and products
One of the key insights of strategists is that resources are limited and should 
be shifted promptly to where a winning strategy is emerging. When you’re 
first working on a new project (a new product, brand, market, or whatever), 
you need to be open-minded and give it a chance to succeed. But when it 
begins to look like the project won’t cut it . . . cut it! Eliminate unpromising 
projects and products to make room for fresh ones with more promise.

If you doubt your ability to imagine new options and invent or acquire new 
products, you may feel overly committed to the old ones. It’s a sad truth of 
corporate strategy that management teams almost always hold on to under-
performing business units, products, or projects for too long. They don’t want 
to admit defeat, so they keep trying to turn the failure around. To avoid the 
trap of overcommitment to an unsuccessful project, strategy, or product, keep 
in mind that it’s easier to achieve success by starting fresh than by staying on 
board a sinking ship. Or maybe a sports analogy is more useful. Imagine that 
your business strategy is like a season, and each project is just one game in 
that season. If you lose a game, you move on and try to win the next game. 
Don’t insist on staying out there on the playing field long after the sun has 
already set, trying to win that one game you’ve already lost. Move on!
Making your next strategic move
 
It’s important to pursue some exciting strategy that holds the promise of a 
rosy future. You can’t rest on your laurels. That’s another fundamental rule 
of strategic planning, but one that most people forget as soon as they achieve 
some success.
Companies don’t stay on top forever. Dozens of supposedly top companies 
have fallen from grace over the past few years. What matters is not your 
reputation or current size, but your recent strategic moves. If your last big 
move was, for example, to make short-term profits by selling overly risky 
home mortgages, you’re heading for disaster, as many lenders have learned 
in the past few years. But if you made a good strategic move, you’re headed 
for success.

86
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Banks that decided to grow rapidly by signing poor-quality, risky home mort-
gages, for example, didn’t have a good strategy, but those that focused on 
lending to qualified borrowers proved to have more lasting success. A strategy 
based on a greedy appetite for easy sales that seem too good to be true is not 
going to be successful in the long run. Strategies based on real points of 
difference that give you some kind of advantage in the eyes of good customers 
are more likely to succeed.
What makes for a successful strategic move? For starters, it has to be big 
enough to make a difference in your overall performance. A little idea may 
not be enough; you have to think fairly big.
Also, a strategic move has to be creative to be successful. You need to do 
something that shifts the market. The term I like to use for innovative strate-
gies is reframing, which means changing the way people think about and see 
something. A strong strategic move reframes the way customers, competitors, 
and industry expert commentators think and talk about your industry. The 
right strategic move has to be innovative enough to make your top competitors 
seem out-of-date. This needs to be your goal when you initiate a strategic 
planning process. Otherwise, there’s really no point.
The third quality a strategic move needs is to be embraced by customers, 
who see it as offering them something substantially helpful or valuable. 
Otherwise, it won’t be a lasting strategy. Lots of companies have used the 
strategy of reducing the contents of a package as a way to save money. A big 
package holds a small candy bar, for example. This strategy fools people for 
a little while, but eventually, you lose out to competitors who are less stingy 
than you. (See “Including customer value in your strategy,” coming up in this 
chapter, for details.)
Deciding how big a strategy to pursue
A corporate strategy says what business you want to be in. A business strategy 
says how you want to run a particular business. A marketing strategy says 
how you will build the strength of a brand and boost its sales. The strategy 
of a project team within the marketing area might focus on developing a 
new, more compact version of the best-selling product. These strategies are 
nested, like a set of traditional Russian dolls. The more specific, narrow strat-
egies fit into the broader corporate strategy.
Which level should you focus on right now? It depends on how well things 
are going. If you’re getting great results down at the operating level and have 
one or more best-selling products that clearly have good momentum, focus 
on refining your already-winning lower-level strategies. But if things aren’t as 
rosy as you’d like, move up from specific to more general, sweeping strategic 
questions until you find a way to turn your performance around. The worst-
case scenario is that you have to go all the way to the biggest question of 

87
 Chapter 5: Being an Innovative Strategist
all — what business should we be in? — and change your fundamental 
strategic focus before you can capture the success you want. When that 
happens, you need a lengthy stay in the creative search phase of the strategic 
cycle (refer to Figure 5-1).
Including customer value in your strategy
It’s not easy to guarantee what strategies will work for you, but it’s pretty 
easy to tell you which ones won’t. Basically, any and all ideas that don’t add 
value from the customer’s perspective are going to fail — at least in the long 
term. Find a way to make your customers’ lives easier, save them money, 
amaze or entertain them, and so forth. Do something they like, something 
they tell other customers about because it’s so great.
Mattress wars give sleepers what they want
A dozen or so years ago, investment bankers 
bought up the two leading mattress manufac-
turers in the United States: Simmons and Sealy. 
Being finance guys, the new owners set to work 
looking for innovations that would improve their 
profits. The big breakthrough came with the 
introduction of one-sided mattresses; the top is 
finished with soft quilted material for sleeping 
on, but the underside is bare. Traditionally, mat-
tresses had two finished sides so that you could 
turn them periodically, ensuring the mattress a 
decades-long life. A single-sided mattress can’t 
be flipped and tends to wear out much more 
quickly, but still, the strategists at Simmons 
and Sealy thought they were on to something. 
It costs so much less to make a one-sided mat-
tress that they were able to lower their prices 
by a modest amount and still make a much 
bigger profit per sale.
The problem was that consumers weren’t as 
impressed by the one-sided mattress as the 
accountants were. Simmons and Sealy began 
to lose market share to rivals. Furthermore, the 
excessively financial focus at these companies 
kept them from doing any real innovation in the 
product category. Upstarts like Tempur-Pedic 
pioneered memory foam as a mattress mate-
rial, while Sealy and Simmons slowly sank. In 
recent surveys of the owners of various brands, 
about 60 percent of Simmons and Sealy owners 
rated their mattresses as comfortable. Compare 
this figure with 80 percent–plus ratings for top 
memory-foam brands like Tempur-Pedic and 
Spa Sensations, and the top rating of all, 87 
percent, for another innovation: the airbed by 
Comfortaire (survey stats from Sleep Like the 
Dead, www.sleeplikethedead.com).
Memory-foam, latex-foam, and even some air 
mattresses can be more comfortable than inner-
spring mattresses such as those that Sealy and 
Simmons traditionally made. Why didn’t these 
two market leaders invent these new, more 
comfortable options? They were overconfident 
and too focused on making a quick buck by 
reducing the cost — and value — of what they 
sold instead of trying to make their products 
better. So I come to the most fundamental rule 
of creative strategy: Try to make things better 
for your customers! That’s what Tempur-Pedic 
was thinking about — and why it became an 
industry leader in a few exciting and highly 
profitable years.

88
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Managing Your Product Portfolio
Most businesses succeed or fail on the strength of their products. To select 
and maintain a winning group of products, you need to recognize that all 
products have lives, rather like animals do. I guess you could think of them 
as your pets — except they ought to be hardworking pets, not pampered pets 
that cost you too much money!
Riding a best-selling product to the top
As you think about which products to sell, keep in mind that business success 
comes from having a best seller. Well, having two or three best sellers is even 
better, but you definitely need at least one, and that means a product that is 
popular and has growing sales. With a product like that, you get flooded with 
orders and have the happy problem of having to scale up to meet the demand. 
If you don’t have a best seller now, promise me that you’ll keep working on it. 
Invent, license, or buy at wholesale some new alternatives, and try them out.
Keep experimenting until you find at least one product whose sales create 
strong momentum for your business. Then brand it carefully with a clear, 
recognizable, consistent identity made up of a unique name and logo presented 
in a strong graphic style. The product’s success builds the strength of your 
brand (which could be your company name or a unique name you give the 
product itself). It’s good to have a recognized, trusted brand name. You can 
use it to introduce related products and create a product line, or selection of 
related products, based on your initial best seller.
That, in essence, is the product-based approach to strategic success. It’s 
a good strategy, but it does have one limitation: Eventually, the product 
category will become outdated because someone will invent something to 
replace it. If that someone isn’t you, you’re probably in big trouble.
Understanding the life cycle of 
each product category
Even if you have a best seller, eventually its category will become outdated, 
and you’ll need to upgrade or replace your offering. If you have a best-selling 
vacuum cleaner, and someone invents a new and better electric motor, you’ll 
need to either redesign your product using the new motor or face declining 
sales and eventually have to withdraw the product from the market.
The product category — the general form or type of products that your product 
competes against — goes through a life cycle, as shown in Figure 5-3.

 Introduction
Growth
Maturity
Decline or Revival
Death
If the product category is fairly new — the result of a recent innovation — most 
of the potential consumers haven’t tried it yet. This is called the introduction 
stage, and in it, there’s lots of opportunity to grow your sales by educating 
the market about the new product and its benefits.
As word spreads, sales accelerate into the growth stage. In the growth stage, 
sales grow faster than the economy as a whole, and the companies that pro-
mote their brands strongly are able to gain leadership positions and ride 
their best sellers to profitable success. You’ve seen this happen in your life-
time over and over: CDs replaced tapes, and now digital forms of music are 
replacing CDs, for example. Make sure that you have one or more products that 
are in the growth stage, because being there is fun and profitable. (Promise 
me that if you don’t have a product in a fast-growing stage right now, you 
won’t rest until you’ve found one, okay?)
The growth stage is great, but it doesn’t last forever. First, you begin to run 
into the ceiling imposed by market saturation, which is when almost every-
one who might use a product like yours already has one. Then you have to 
compete to sell consumers their next replacement, which is slower going and 
marks the maturity stage. You can expect competitive advertising and lots of 
pressure on your pricing, so your profits may go down. Then something even 
worse happens: The product starts becoming outdated, and people stop 
using it in favor of something hot and new. This is the decline stage.
Even if you don’t, someone will innovate, outdating your product category in 
the process. You might find yourself a leader in making and selling typewrit-
ers, for example. Not much profit in that, is there?
Figure 5-3 shows this life cycle and what happens as it nears its end. Either 
you (or a competitor) revive the product by updating it, or some outsider 
comes up with a completely new replacement and drives you and your 

90
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
conventional competitors out of business. By then, however, I hope you’ve 
got some new best seller in a more lively product category!
 
Keep in mind that every one of your products lives within a product category — 
and that its category has a life cycle. Growth-stage products are the most 
profitable, and you need to make sure that you have some at all times.
Mapping your product portfolio
A strategic approach to products helps ensure that you have a good new 
crop coming along, as well as a good selection of mature products that pro-
duce strong profits. In other words, you need a healthy portfolio of products. 
What does that look like? See Figure 5-4 for the way I like to look at any firm’s 
selection of products to gain strategic insight into them.
As Figure 5-4 shows, it’s very helpful to rate each of your products on two 
dimensions: profitability and uniqueness.
 
✓ Profitability can be measured by the product’s profit margin, or the 
percentage of its sales price that you get to keep after paying all 
expenses related to producing and selling it. Profitability tends to be 
higher when there’s less competition and when you have a larger share 
of the market than your competitors. In mature markets, profits are thin 
unless you have a dominant share of sales. Innovation may help you 
achieve stronger sales, allowing you to have better profits for longer.
 
✓ Uniqueness can be measured by comparing each product with its closest 
competitors. If it’s similar to them, it gets a low uniqueness score. If it 
stands out as being unusual or different, it gets a high uniqueness score. 
If I do this analysis for a big company, I ask customers to provide the 
ratings of uniqueness, but that means budgeting for surveys or focus 
groups, which can be quite expensive. You may simply want to make 
your best guess and do the ratings yourself. Often, you can guess what 
your customers would say with pretty good accuracy.
As Figure 5-4 shows, innovative products are high on uniqueness, but if 
they’re new and untested in the market, they’re not likely to be all that profit-
able. They’re represented in the figure by a graduation cap, and the goal is 
to develop them with the hope that they will graduate to market success and 
begin to produce profits. If so, your goal is to work on maximizing their profits 
and growing their market share.
After a while, the innovative products get old, and lots of competitors spring 
up. Then you know that time is limited (which is why they’re represented in 
Figure 5-4 by an hourglass). Update them by giving them more unique quali-
ties, or they’ll fall into the bottom-right quadrant of the figure, where both 
uniqueness and profitability are low. These products need to be cut from 
your catalog at once to allow you to put your resources behind the products 
on the left side of the grid.

A great exercise is to draw a big product portfolio grid on a large sheet 
of paper and plot each of your products on it, as shown in Figure 5-5. The 
portfolio shown in the figure has ten products in it. Three of them (E, F, and 
H) are old, and their profitability and uniqueness are low. They should be 
phased out. Two (I and G) are new and promising, and merit investment. 
They may develop into successful products that produce high profits. The 
dotted line shows the trajectory for products over their life cycles. They start 
in the bottom-left quadrant of the figure and ideally rise to high profitability 
before gradually becoming ordinary and ultimately outdated. (Refer to Figure 5-4 
for explanations of the four quadrants of the strategic grid used in Figure 5-5.)

Planting enough seeds to make 
sure something grows
How many successful products do you need? A few would be great, but really, 
even one blockbuster would be just fine, right? So the question is this: What 
are the odds of a best seller? The answer depends on your particular business 
and industry, and on how you go about adding products to your line:
 
✓ If you’re a reseller: You can go to trade shows, examine hundreds of 
products, and try to select some hot new products that you think will be 
popular in the coming year. You have the advantage of seeing finished 
products and picking the most promising, so you may be able to guess 
with reasonable accuracy. Perhaps one of every five or ten new products 
you sell will prove to be best sellers.
 
✓ If you design and produce your own products: You have to look farther 
ahead and exercise more imagination and guesswork. Perhaps only 1 in 
20 or 50 of your initial ideas and designs will turn into a best seller.
Although I can’t tell you exactly what your odds of having a best seller are, 
I can tell you that you won’t guess right every time. You need to plant at least 
a handful of seeds to harvest even one best-selling product, so make sure 
that you look at plenty of options and test a few new ones every year.
Seeking Strategic Partnerships
Complementary strategies reinforce each other. Sometimes rather than an 
either–or choice, you actually have a complementary pair of options that 
are best chosen together. The make-versus-buy decision is a great example 
of complementarity. In innovation, make means inventing things yourself, 
whereas buy means adopting others’ inventions (by purchasing and reselling 
or by licensing the rights to make them, for example). Exciting new research 
shows that high-tech firms with both active invention and licensing (make 
and buy) strategies do better than those that do mostly one or the other. 
I find that the same rule applies in other firms too.
 
I spent a week working with a team of lawyers and scientists at S.C. Johnson and 
Sons, helping them develop negotiating skills for when they go out and shop for 
inventions. A surprising number of the company’s successful consumer prod-
ucts aren’t invented in S.C. Johnson’s own labs but actually are licensed from 
other inventors elsewhere. What I saw in that company applies to yours too: 
The expertise, imagination, and momentum of invention flows back and forth 
between your company and outside inventors, enriching your options.

93
 Chapter 5: Being an Innovative Strategist
 
If you need a basic essential for your business, either buy it or make it, 
depending on what’s most economical. But when it comes to innovation strat-
egies, try to both make and buy. Always put some effort into working on your 
own inventions, but also keep an eye open outside your walls for good ideas 
you could bring in.
In many cases, it’s simplest to join forces with another company that has the 
capabilities or technologies you want. These long-term partnerships, called 
strategic alliances, are defined as cooperative agreements between two or more 
organizations that share complementary expertise or other resources to accom-
plish something they can’t do on their own. Strategic alliances can include
 
✓ Working together to bring a product to market by taking advantage of 
each other’s products, distribution, and sales
 
✓ Cooperating to develop or produce an innovative product
 
✓ Licensing a technology or invention to apply it in a specific industry
 
✓ Combining technical expertise to develop or produce an innovative product
 
✓ Cooperating to bring one firm’s invention or product to market in the 
other firm’s country or region
These are the most common forms of strategic alliances, but the possibilities 
are limited only by your imagination. A firm with strong retail distribution 
might cooperate with an industrial-chemicals company to sell consumer 
versions of its industrial cleaning products. The alliance combines consumer-
products expertise with industrial chemistry — a promising combination that 
might lead to powerful household cleaning products.
Is there some business you could form an alliance with? Definitely! But you 
may not have identified it yet, so look around for a partner. Think of creative 
combinations of your strengths and other firms’ strengths. (In strategic plan-
ning, strengths are often called core competencies, so if you hear that term, 
that’s what it means.)
A good way to look for potential strategic alliance partners is to make a list of 
your major strengths and weaknesses; then look around for other businesses 
whose strengths and weaknesses mirror yours. If your company is great at 
sales but not so good at manufacturing, look for a manufacturer that usually 
works under contract and lacks a direct sales force of its own. Combined, 
your two sets of strengths make new strategies possible. When you identify 
a potential partner, see whether its executives will sit down with you and 
brainstorm ways of cashing in on your combined strengths.

Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Mastering the Art of Change Management
Change management is the artful leadership of a transition in your business. 
Innovation requires transitions. If you develop or switch to a new product, 
you have to update all your marketing materials, liquidate old inventory, and 
make sure that everyone knows how to sell and support the new product. 
If you expand to a new area, you may have to open new facilities, train new 
staff, and find out how to operate according to new customs. If you adopt a 
new technology, you have to master it yourself and make sure that everyone 
else gets up to speed on it too. While adjusting to the new technology, you 
may encounter unexpected problems that irritate people and make them 
resist the change.
Enlisting the eager believers and 
excluding the hopeless cases
Some people love change, but the majority resist it, at least at first. People 
who are naturally very creative and open to new experiences get bored when 
things don’t change, so they welcome transitions and the challenges they 
bring. Such people are your allies when you’re trying to bring about a change, 
and you should get them involved right away. Try to get them in leadership 
positions if at all possible.
The majority of people resist change at first and see it as an inconvenience. 
They may also feel nervous or concerned about possible negative effects. Help 
this nervous majority by explaining as clearly as possible what will happen 
to them during the change. Tell them early on about any effects that they’ll 
experience personally. Then they’ll be clearer about what’s going to happen, 
enabling them to stop worrying and start focusing on their assigned roles.
Another group of people — fortunately, a minority — resists change very 
strongly, and you can’t bring these people around simply by explaining how 
the change will affect them. They may be nervous and excitable or very rigid 
about wanting to have everything done a certain way. For them, change is 
threatening, and they’ll probably refuse to help out. Only at the very end, 
when it becomes clear that the change is permanent, will they adjust their 
own behavior.
Protect your innovations from these strong resisters by
 
✓ Never allowing a change-resister to play a leadership role during 
a transition

95
 Chapter 5: Being an Innovative Strategist
 
✓ Keeping them out of planning sessions and away from the work of 
making the change as much as possible
 
✓ Avoiding hiring people like them, who are threatened by even a 
small change in the routine
 
Make being flexible and innovative a part of every job description when you 
hire in the future. It’s important to keep people who hate change away from 
your workplace if you possibly can. Change management is much easier when 
you avoid the most difficult, highly resistant types of people in the first place.
When you know and work with people, it’s obvious who’s open to new 
experiences and changes and who’s highly resistant to them. But what about 
people you don’t know? One way to predict who’ll be an ally during change 
is to ask people to voluntarily complete a Big Five personality assessment. 
Those who score high on openness (one of the five main dimensions of 
personality) are allies in change; those who score low on openness and low 
on calmness are resistant and shouldn’t be part of the core team during a 
transition. You can obtain Big Five self-assessment forms inexpensively at 
www.tspectrum.com, or go to www.supportforinnovation.com for 
more information about assessing personality and selecting those who are 
natural innovators.
Making the destination visible to all
It’s natural to want to talk about the plans and steps involved in any change, 
but people really need to hear about two other things first: the effect on them 
and the ultimate destination (where the journey is going to end). Painting a 
clear, attractive picture of the destination is particularly important.
Start with a real sales presentation of the goal and why you’re so excited to 
be pursuing it; then keep reminding everyone of the goal and benefits. Each 
time you talk about what people need to do — the specific plan of action — 
remember to evoke that appealing image of the ultimate destination.
 
Branding your goal with a catchy or memorable name and image, just as 
though you were selling a product, is often helpful. Make your change tangible 
and appealing so that everyone keeps the goal in sight as they work.
Keep in mind as you “sell” the destination that there’s no need to overpromise. 
Explain honestly and accurately what you expect the future to be. Don’t 
exaggerate the benefits, because if you overpromise, you’ll pay for it in terms 
of lost credibility and disloyalty later on.

96
Part I: Making Your Mark as an Innovator 
Managing resistance during 
the change process
If you could wave a magic wand and bring about all the changes of your new 
strategy immediately, you’d encounter very little resistance. People might be 
shocked at first, but if everything were neatly in place in some new configuration, 
they’d adapt quickly. That’s why speed is a good goal during the change 
process. Don’t let people’s anxieties and objections slow you down. Keep a 
fast pace, and push through the initial skepticism and resistance as firmly 
and promptly as you possibly can.
Figure 5-6 shows how the emotional state in a workplace is affected by a 
major change such as a new strategy or the adoption of a major innovation. 
People enter the panic stage shortly after the news of a change hits. Panic is 
especially high if people fear that they will be personally injured; they may 
worry about layoffs or increases in their workloads, for example.

As Figure 5-6 shows, people initially fear most changes, and their resistance 
climbs quite quickly as they hear and amplify negative rumors about what’s 
going to happen. People resist uncertainty more than anything else, so focus 
your efforts on countering this effect with lots of clear, detailed communi-
cation about the change. Also push to implement the change as quickly as 
possible. As soon as the new rules of the game become clear, anxiety and 
resistance will start to fall.

97
 Chapter 5: Being an Innovative Strategist
 
Eventually, resistance will drop, and a new equilibrium will be reached in 
which most people accept the change and settle into their new routine.
Watching out for snap-back
Acceptance of change can be deceptive. Residual memory of the old way 
remains, and given half a chance, people will snap back into old patterns and 
ways of doing things. Therefore, you need to police the new stability and 
jump on any reversion to old patterns quickly and firmly. Don’t let anyone get 
away with snap-back behavior, or soon you’ll find that others are following 
suit and retreating to their old habits again.

In this part . . .
T
here’s always another way, and there’s a limitless 
supply of ideas. Creativity is the key to inventions, 
improvements, solutions, breakthroughs, and brilliant 
suggestions, but when you really need a better idea, it’s 
often hard to produce one. This part arms you with an 
incredible number of tools and techniques to generate 
great new ideas.
Brainstorming a list of possibilities is as simple as recog-
nizing the need for ideas and committing a little time and 
scrap paper to the job. You can produce good ideas all by 
yourself or with a group or team. Or you can look around 
for good ideas that you can adapt to your needs, exciting 
new products you can purchase, or patents you can 
license. The world is full of great new ideas and inventions, 
so you don’t necessarily have to invent something 
completely new.
Whether you invent your own or take advantage of 
someone else’s great new ideas, it’s important to recognize 
the power of a good idea. Companies and careers are built 
on the strength of good ideas. This part helps you 
generate some of your own!

G
roups can be smarter than individuals, but unfortunately, they usu-
ally aren’t. The typical group of people — on a subway platform, at a 
sports stadium, or in a meeting — has a herd mentality. Most people don’t 
step up and contribute at all, and the few who do tend to be loud-mouthed 
and narrow-minded. You can’t expect groups of people to solve challenging 
problems or generate clever insights. They often get into arguments, come 
up with foolish ideas, or make serious mistakes. Unsupervised groups aren’t 
much use to the innovator.
However, groups offer two potential advantages to you in your quest for a 
breakthrough idea. First, they allow you to tap into a diversity of knowledge 
and experience. Second, they make it possible to take advantage of healthy 
group dynamics (the ways people interact socially in small groups). If you get 
people thinking and talking in an open, creative manner, they often surprise 
themselves and you with the breadth and depth of their creative thinking. 
A group of a half dozen to a dozen people can, if well managed, produce 100 
plausible new product concepts in a two-day retreat, allowing you to select 
the strongest ideas from their list for further development and testing.
I like to push groups to produce at least 100 concepts. It seems impossible 
to them at the beginning of the session, but with the right group processes, 
ideas begin to flow and build on one another until everyone is surprised and 
excited by their creative productivity. The trick is to facilitate a productive 
group process. Creative facilitation is optimizing the creative output of a 
small, select group of people by managing the group’s dynamics. This chap-
ter shows you how to be an effective facilitator of creative sessions — a skill 
you can use in dozens of ways as you put group creativity to use.

Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Identifying Opportunities 
for Group Creativity
One experience with a poorly run creative session may have turned people 
off to the idea of group creativity, so you may bump into initial resistance. 
If so, don’t let the naysayers get you down! Group creativity is a powerful 
force, and it can make fast work of problems like the following:
 
✓ Low staff morale
 
✓ A conflict needing resolution
 
✓ Losses or lack of profitability
 
✓ A need for new products
 
✓ A need for a fresh new ad campaign
 
✓ A need for a new or updated brand identity
 
✓ Inefficiencies or repeated errors in a work process
 
✓ A challenge filling a staff position
 
✓ A tough engineering or design problem
 
✓ A need to do more with less in the budget
 
This list of opportunities for group creativity may seem long, but if you were 
to ask a well-facilitated group to brainstorm more opportunities for group 
creativity, I’m sure they could. In fact, that’s a great exercise. At your next 
meeting, why not give your staff the challenge of generating 50 topics that 
could benefit from a group creativity session? I’m quite confident that they 
will produce a strong list. When they do, ask them to come up with a way to 
prioritize the list. Then see what the top five priorities are. You may find this 
exercise alone is enough to kick-start momentum for innovation in your 
workplace. This section looks at a variety of additional ways to get group 
creativity going.
Calling for help with a problem
Problems focus attention. When a hospital has trouble filling its nursing posi-
tions, everyone worries about it. They ask questions such as “Will we have 
to raise salaries for nurses, and if so, how can we afford to do that?” A prob-
lem is a great opportunity to initiate group creativity. However, be warned! 
Problems produce closed-minded thinking, so if you want to take a creative 
approach, you have to reframe the problem. Reframing is changing the funda-
mental way people think about something.

103
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
In the example of a hospital that’s having trouble filling its nursing positions, 
the common responses are framed negatively. People worry that the hospital 
will go over budget or that healthcare will deteriorate. They use words like 
impossible and crisis, which get everyone thinking pessimistically. To shift 
the frame toward a more optimistic, open approach to problem-solving, you 
need to follow a three-step process:
 
1. Make the case for exploring fresh options.
 
 Be positively assertive, not critical and negative. Say, “We’re stuck with 
unpleasant options and don’t see a good way to resolve the problem. 
I want to pull together a team that will try to generate some fresh thinking 
about what to do.” Be careful to disassociate your proposal from anything 
else going on. Make it clear that you’re not taking sides, and also empha-
size that you don’t want or need problem-solving authority. Your results 
will simply be food for thought. Let people know that while you hope to 
come up with a good solution, you aren’t asking for an advance commit-
ment to implement whatever you suggest.
 
2. Get permission to convene a creative group.
 
 If you’re a manager or executive, you can simply invite people to a 
brainstorming session. If not, you need to get someone with authority to 
back your proposal. Pick someone you have a decent working relation-
ship with (someone who trusts you to be productive and focused as the 
group’s facilitator). Choose someone high enough in the organization 
to allow you to tap into multiple departments or functions to achieve a 
diverse group with a breadth of knowledge and perspectives. You may 
also use your network to reach out and draw in people from outside 
your workplace who can bring fresh ideas or unique knowledge. Ask 
them when and for how long you can get them to commit; then line your 
insiders up for an event that fits the outsiders’ schedules. (If your group 
will discuss any confidential information, ask participants, especially 
outsiders, to sign nondisclosure agreements.)
 
3. Pick people who will bring positive thinking to the problem.
 
 Screening for attitude is important! As I discuss in Chapter 1, underlying 
attitude makes a world of difference. Exclude naysayers who obviously 
have a negative attitude or a bone to pick. They’ll only work against you 
as you try to facilitate an open brainstorming session. Find whatever 
excuses you must, but be firm: Nobody with a negative attitude is 
allowed to attend! (The later section, “In or Out?: Issuing Invites to 
the Brainstorming Session,” gives you more advice on making 
thoughtful selections.)
If you use this simple three-step process to call for creative help with a 
knotty problem, you’ll get a group that’s eager and able to explore the 
problem from fresh perspectives. Positive problem-solving groups are very 
powerful forces; they often produce fresh new ideas and options, and may 
generate the next big innovation for your organization.

104
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Inviting questions for consideration
A great way to identify creative options is to ask people to pose questions in 
a brainstorming session and see what you get. If asking for questions doesn’t 
give you good results, pose questions of your own to stimulate engagement. 
A question such as “What’s the most important problem for us to work on 
right now?” can generate a variety of answers, but often, you find that a third 
or more of the answers address the same issue. When you’ve identified an 
issue that’s on many people’s minds, you can brainstorm for solutions.
 
You can also use open-ended, thought-provoking questions to get the group’s 
creative juices flowing. Ask for input in the form of wish-we-had and wish-we-
could ideas. Challenge everyone to share five “I wish we had . . .” and five 
“I wish we could . . .” sentences of their choice. Then pull together a group to 
sift through the resulting submissions, and select one from each category to 
work on in a brainstorming session.
Building on suggestions
A suggestion system can be used as input for creative groups. Start with sug-
gestions offered by employees, either anonymously in a suggestion box or 
openly in response to a request for proposals. Instead of having management 
read the suggestions and pick the ones they like, assemble a group to brain-
storm the suggestions. Try pulling suggestions at random (rather than filtering 
them based on merit), and challenge the group to find a way to make each sug-
gestion work. Sometimes, the most naïve or impractical suggestions produce 
the greatest innovations when the group gets to work on them. Even a wildly 
impractical idea or suggestion can lead to ideas that may prove more practical.
In or Out?: Issuing Invites to 
the Brainstorming Session
Rounding up a good set of participants is one of the simplest and best ways 
to ensure an easy-to-facilitate creative group. Like a party, a creative group 
needs a good guest list. Put some thought into who might add fresh informa-
tion or ideas, and look for ways to mix up the group with diverse people — 
including those who don’t normally work together. You want to generate 
some creative chemistry, which arises when people with differing experiences, 
styles, and perspectives work intensely together.
This section helps you sort out your ideal group size and provides some 
additional criteria for deciding who should be in the group and who’s best 
left on the sidelines.

105
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
Deciding how big to make the group
Your group should be no smaller than 5 (4 participants plus a facilitator) 
and probably no larger than 15. As you approach 20 people, facilitating the 
participatory process becomes more difficult, and your group will be char-
acterized by more social loafing (lack of participation and mental laziness on 
the part of some members).
If you’re a beginning facilitator, aim for a group of between six and eight, 
which gives you enough people to ensure a lively session but avoids the 
complexities of larger groups. Groups of ten or more require more active 
and skilled facilitation.
 
If you feel that your topic requires a larger group to include all the needed 
perspectives and experts, consider dividing the group in two and bringing in 
a second facilitator. Reserve adjoining rooms, and brief and debrief the group 
as a whole, but divide it for the actual brainstorming activities to ensure full 
participation by all members.
Excluding people who squash 
the creative spirit
Some people rain on every creative parade — people who often say things 
like “We already tried that,” “That’s impossible,” or “We could never afford 
that,” making it hard for others to be open-minded. Exclude closed-minded 
or negative thinkers. Also consider excluding anyone who, by virtue of high 
status or rank, might make others uncomfortable and unwilling to contribute. 
Finally, exclude people who’ve been around so long that they think they 
know it all. What they know is how things used to be, not how they could be 
in the future. You don’t need negative baggage.
 
Be tough about excluding people who might ruin your event. It’s far harder to 
shut them up when they’re in your session and saying the wrong things than 
to exclude them from the get-go, so bite the bullet, and don’t let them talk 
their way in. Be firm, impersonal, and polite — but mostly firm — in telling 
people who is and is not invited. It’s your party: You’re the facilitator, so 
you’re in charge of the guest list. If others don’t like it, too bad. They can facili-
tate their own sessions! (But they won’t. The people you want to keep out are 
people who don’t really believe in creative, open-minded discussion, so they’ll 
never initiate a brainstorming session.)

106
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Including people who contribute 
needed knowledge
Ignorance is bliss, as the old saying goes, and unfortunately, this saying 
often applies to brainstorming. A group that lacks in-depth understanding of 
a topic will come up with simplistic, impractical ideas that sound good only 
to people who don’t know any better. Your group ought to include outsiders, 
not only for their fresh perspectives, but also for the reservoir of technical 
knowledge and experience they can give the group to draw upon. Just make 
sure to screen the experts for openness to new ideas so that you don’t get 
experts who squash every suggestion.
Adding people who bring unique 
perspectives and styles
Group diversity is an essential part of good creative facilitation. Reach out as 
far as you can to draw a diverse group, including people from other organiza-
tions, cultures, and places. Also give thought to personality and style. Can 
you create a mix of artistic, free-thinking people with organized, logical ones? 
If so, creative sparks may fly when they start talking about their ideas. Group 
diversity can lead to creative friction, the inspirational tension that arises 
when people have competing perspectives. As the facilitator, your positive 
view toward diversity and the differing perspectives it offers will rub off on 
your group and help them achieve insight from creative friction.
Planning the Creative Process
The creative process consists of the specific activities you plan for your 
creative group. A very simple (but effective) group process is to assemble a 
group for a morning, challenge them with a problem or other creative goal, 
and have them work through a series of brainstorming activities. Collect the 
group’s output by taking notes on large chart pads; then summarize it after-
ward in a neat report that you can e-mail or hand-deliver to the participants. 
Give them an opportunity to comment on or add more ideas to your draft 
report before you finalize it and distribute it beyond your group.
Many creative challenges can be overcome with a simple, one-session creative 
process. However, complex or especially difficult projects may require multiple 
meetings, often with team members conducting research between sessions. 
This section focuses on getting the timing right — figuring out how much time 
you need to allow to successfully work through the creative process.

 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
Deciding how much creative 
distance you want to travel
Sometimes, you can’t tell whether or not one meeting will do the trick until 
you see how far the group gets in its first session. However, you can often 
guess which projects are going to need multiple meetings based on the scope 
of the question, problem, or project. A project involving major obstacles or 
multistage design and problem-solving may require the group to cover more 
creative distance (the amount of invention required to accomplish the goal).
If you want a group to come up with a breakthrough design for a new elec-
tronic product, you can anticipate a need for multiple sessions (probably five 
or more). If you think you have a lot of work to do, schedule several sessions, 
either on consecutive days or, if that’s not possible, once a week.
When I facilitate sessions for complex products involving electronic or other 
engineering challenges, I usually suggest an intense initial retreat of one 
and a half to two days, followed by research on the resulting ideas and then 
several more one-day sessions in which the initial ideas are explored and 
developed. However, when I work on projects with fewer technical issues or 
constraints, I often plan just one or two creative sessions. A group can 
generate dozens of interesting new product concepts for snack foods in a 
single day, for example.
Budgeting sufficient time
Creativity can happen in an instant, so in theory, a group ought to be able 
to achieve a breakthrough in a session of an hour or less. Sometimes, a half 
hour of brainstorming is enough, but rarely! Plan for a minimum of several 
hours of focused creative effort to ensure both quantity and quality of ideas. 
I try to get a group to commit to a full-day session, with a generous lunch 
break in the middle to allow them to recharge.
 
If you can possibly do it, break your creative sessions into two days of work 
with a good night’s sleep between them. An afternoon session followed by 
dinner and relaxed social interaction sets a group up for a highly productive 
full-day session the next day. This approach takes advantage of the power of 
incubation, the unconscious creative processing that occurs between periods 
of intense focus on a problem or challenge. To trigger incubation, you need 
to get the group deeply involved in and focused on a tough problem before 
letting them go. Then bring them back for another session before they forget 
their earlier experience. Think of incubation as keeping a soup broth simmer-
ing on the back burners of their minds. It shouldn’t be the main focus, but it 
shouldn’t be forgotten and allowed to cool, either.

108
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Multiday sessions work well because they allow for overnight incubation. 
Letting the group “sleep on it” is an effective facilitation technique. Also try 
to block in several possible meeting times reaching out into future weeks. 
If your group solves the problem brilliantly in the first session, you can 
always cancel subsequent meetings, but if it doesn’t, you’ll be glad you 
reserved additional times.
Deciding how many sessions to run
The simplest rule for deciding how many sessions you’ll need is to double 
the number of sessions you think you’ll need. If you think a simple one-day 
session should be enough, plan a two-day session! In my experience, groups 
either achieve a startling breakthrough very quickly (quite rare) or take 
much longer than you expect to produce something useful. So plan for a 
lengthy process, and you won’t be disappointed.
If you have to map a process (an important first step when working on quality 
problems, for example), expect to spend the entire first session just diagram-
ming the process. This means that you need to schedule at least two more 
sessions to work on redesigning the process, plus a final one to work on an 
implementation plan.
If you’re brainstorming for new product or design ideas (for example, naming 
or branding a new line of business), you may be able to produce a lot of inter-
esting ideas in just one or two sessions. However, if you also need to pick 
the best idea and develop it into something refined enough to actually imple-
ment, you need to book at least five times as much time for implementation 
planning as it took to come up with the concept in the first place.
 
Implementation teams need a lot of time. Schedule as many meetings as you can 
fit into the group’s calendar before the drop-dead implementation date. You can 
always cancel sessions if the group manages to complete its work early.
Preparing for Your Role as Facilitator
As a facilitator, your primary goal is to encourage creativity and participation 
by the entire group. Your secondary goal is to channel and focus that creativity 
and participation in productive directions. In this section, I help you prepare 
for your role by rehearsing the skills you need to get people thinking and 
voicing their thoughts.

109
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
Practicing your questioning 
and listening skills
In general conversation, people mostly use closed-ended questions, which are 
questions that ask for only a narrow range of responses. A yes-or-no question 
permits only two answers, so it’s obviously closed-ended. A question such as 
“What are the best approaches to the shortage of raw materials?” is closed-
ended too, although in a less obvious way. It limits responses in two ways: by 
asking for solutions to a specific problem (the shortage of raw materials) and 
by asking for the best approaches. The use of a qualifying adjective such as 
best, good, appropriate, affordable, or sensible signals that you want only 
cautious, well-considered responses.
Because creativity requires open-minded thinking, closed-ended questions 
need to be weeded out of your facilitation vocabulary. Practice using open-
ended questions — questions that challenge listeners to expand their thinking. 
Instead of asking, “Do you think we should switch to recycled materials for 
our packaging?” (a yes-or-no, closed-ended question), you could ask, “How 
many ways can you think of to use recycled materials?” That’s an open-ended 
question with the potential to produce exciting new ideas and possibilities.
In addition to asking open-ended, creative questions, you need to be a good 
listener. People commonly listen with a critical attitude, which discourages 
open conversation. Facilitation involves listening with an open mind and 
making people feel good about their contributions. As you listen to ideas, 
suggestions, and answers, try to be positive and encouraging. Nod and smile 
as people talk. Thank them for their ideas or comments. Point out something 
interesting or useful about each contribution. These affirmative reactions will 
make the group feel good about contributing and will stimulate more 
contributions.
Also practice taking clear notes about what people say. Often, the facilitator 
needs to summarize the ideas the group generates, which may come rapidly. 
Jot down these ideas on a chart pad in big print. You want participants to 
springboard off earlier ideas, so make your notes legible. If you’re not used to 
recording a group’s ideas on a large pad or board, practice this skill with one 
or more assistants who can shout out ideas or phrases for you to write down.
Guiding the group away from 
negative dynamics
Most of the brainstorming exercises you’re likely to use will have one rule in 
common: no criticizing other people’s ideas. If someone says, “We could use 
organic materials for all our packaging!”, encourage the group to build on this 
suggestion. Someone might add, “Maybe they make organic paper products 

110
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
now. Could we use organic cardboard boxes?” At this point, someone might 
say something pragmatic like “It doesn’t make any sense to use organic pack-
aging because people only care about organic products when it’s something 
they eat. Besides, I don’t think there is any certification for organic papers, so 
we probably couldn’t even purchase such a thing in the first place.”
Although this criticism might have some validity, as a facilitator you must 
prohibit such comments. Politely point out that you want the group to suspend 
judgment to allow the ideas to flow, no matter how impractical they may 
seem. Also point out that in many cases, the idea that seems wildest or silliest 
is the one that leads to a creative breakthrough.
 
Groups often respond well to facilitator guidance and stop critiquing ideas; 
however, sometimes the habit of criticizing is deeply ingrained, and the group 
continues to find fault with ideas. If this happens, ask the group to try a 
challenging exercise: Have them suggest only fantasy ideas that seem unreal-
istic and impractical. After generating wild and crazy ideas for 15 minutes or 
so, they’ll probably be cured of their desire to impose practical constraints on 
their own thinking.
Other negative dynamics may also plague your group, such as the tendency 
for one person or a few people to dominate. If you see that participation is 
uneven, point out the imbalance, and ask the dominant contributors to take 
a break and let others speak. If the others continue to be hesitant, you may 
actually have to divide the group into smaller groups. People who are quiet 
in larger settings may become talkative in groups of three or four. Other 
remedies include calling on specific individuals or imposing a rotational rule 
requiring each person to speak in turn.
Both individuals and groups tend to fall into common thinking traps, called 
mental biases and group biases by psychologists. The worst one for innovators 
is the rush to judgment, in which everyone is quick to agree with the first plau-
sible suggestion or solution. Early agreement may indicate that the group 
has failed to explore all the options. Challenge the group to consider more 
ideas before reaching a conclusion. Chapter 21 addresses additional thinking 
errors and group biases that you need to be prepared to remedy.
Controlling your nonverbal signals
The best facilitators do relatively little talking and let their bodies do much 
of the work. A relaxed, open posture, along with an encouraging, interested 
demeanor, works wonders in opening up a group and generating creative 
contributions. Nodding and smiling in an encouraging manner let people 
know that you like their ideas.

111
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
Also use your body language to energize the group. At first, ideas will come 
slowly. As soon as people begin to voice their ideas, move eagerly to the flip 
chart and begin to write the ideas down. Work neatly but rapidly, as if excited 
to capture a brilliant thought. As you write, keep looking back toward the 
speakers and nodding, so they know you’re eager to hear more. As soon as 
you’ve captured a thought, turn and face the group fully to listen attentively 
to the next idea.
 
Watch out for habitual gestures, expressions, postures, stances, and move-
ments. You need a different set of nonverbal behavior for facilitating creative 
groups because your habits are based on workplace norms, where free, open 
creativity is out of place. People look tight and controlled at work. Creativity 
needs to be loose and uncontrolled. You may want to practice in front of a 
mirror (a full-size mirror is best) so that you can work on a more relaxed, 
open, playful nonverbal presentation.
See Chapter 20 for more details on how to avoid noncreative body language 
and how to use creative body language to good effect as a facilitator.
Becoming familiar with the 
challenge at hand
As a facilitator, you need to bang your head against the creative challenge 
wall in advance and come up with at least a handful of creative ideas of your 
own. Research the topic to make sure that you have a good general under-
standing of its scope and are in command of the relevant facts. Check out 
comparable cases so you’ll know how other organizations have approached 
the problem or challenge. Then spend some time brainstorming on your own. 
Put enough time into the problem to feel like something of an expert, with 
your own creative insights.
 
When you facilitate the creative group, do not begin by telling them what you 
think, even though your ideas may be more developed than theirs. Keep your 
knowledge and ideas in reserve. The purpose of preparing is to be better able 
to guide the group’s thinking, not to dominate it.
As you facilitate, dip into your knowledge and ideas if there seems to be a 
gap in the group’s knowledge or thinking. Offer your insights in the form of 
questions so the group feels like it owns the answers. For example, it’s better 
to say, “What do you think about the example of XYZ Company?” than “I stud-
ied the XYZ Company’s solution, and I think it could be applied to us.”

112
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Mastering the Core Brainstorming 
Methods
The term brainstorming is somewhat like a brand name that people tend 
to use in a more general sense (Kleenex rather than tissue, for example). 
Brainstorming was first coined to describe a specific method of generating 
ideas but has since become a handy, generic term for any and all guided 
group creativity techniques where the goal is to produce lots of ideas.
Almost all so-called brainstorming sessions begin with an introduction to the 
purpose and process, followed by a short warm-up to engage and loosen up 
the group and then a focused effort to express and capture any and all ideas 
that occur. The main goal is to be open and enthusiastic about all ideas and 
options, and this means suspending critical thinking.
 
Critical thinking is the enemy of creative thinking. There is a time for critical 
thinking, but it’s not now. Make sure the group understands that the goal is to 
generate lots and lots of ideas first and then to sift through them with a 
critical eye later.
Warming up the group
Open the group’s first session with an initial briefing in which you introduce 
yourself, the topic, and the process you have planned for the group to follow. 
Your initial briefing to the group has two objectives:
 
✓ To orient the group: Explain what the problem or opportunity is and 
what you hope the group will produce. Then summarize the process by 
explaining what they’ll be doing and giving them a rough timeline for the 
activities. If you plan follow-up meetings, homework between meetings, 
or other activities that stretch into the future, summarize these as well. 
People like to know what’s expected of them — especially the time 
commitments they’re expected to make.
 
✓ To set the tone: Demonstrate an open, inquisitive, noncritical style. 
Make sure that you introduce your plans for the meeting with the need 
for openness in mind. If you come across as overly strict or narrow-
minded, no one will feel good about being creative in your session.
You may also run the group through one or several warm-up exercises, which 
are brief, engaging activities that demonstrate the kinds of creative thinking 
you want the group to do. Following are four warm-ups to open the group up 
to creative expression. If your session is only an hour in length, run just one 
of these, but for half- to full-day sessions, take the time to run all four. Give 
the group no more than five minutes for each. Do them in quick succession 

113
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
from first to last (because they build increasingly difficult skills: fantasy idea 
generation, practical idea generation, process-oriented planning, and problem 
identification — which is a particularly challenging kind of brainstorming). 
Ask the group to
 
1. Think of ten ways for human beings to fly, aside from the obvious 
ones involving airplanes or helicopters.
 
 This exercise requires the group to think imaginatively and gets them in 
touch with their sense of fun and fantasy.
 
2. Come up with ten ways to open a jar of jam on which the lid is stuck.
 
 This exercise brings the group’s imagination into the practical realm and 
demonstrates their ability to come up with useful insights.
 
3. Design three options for “drops” whereby one spy could hand off 
secret papers to another in a public place without any possibility of 
being seen or caught.
 
 This exercise engages the group in process brainstorming, which can be 
more difficult than product brainstorming.
 
4. Invent a completely new kind of footwear that solves some major 
problem.
 
 This exercise requires people to brainstorm problems as well as 
solutions, which orients them toward finding opportunity.
If you need to warm up the same group again on a succeeding day, visit 
www.supportforinnovation.com for my library of warm-ups you can use. 
It’s best to run warm-ups each time you work with the group, and it’s good to 
have new warm-ups each time.
Using Osborn’s brainstorming rules
Alex Osborn is credited with the invention of formal brainstorming. His tech-
nique is a good one, and facilitators often utilize it. Here are the instructions 
you need to give the group in order to get them started:
 
✓ Don’t judge or criticize the ideas.
 
✓ Offer wild and outlandish ideas along with practical ones.
 
✓ Aim for quantity, and don’t worry about quality.
 
✓ Build on each other’s ideas.

114
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
It’s important to enforce these rules — politely and without blame or criticism, 
but with a firm hand. You may occasionally need to remind participants that 
wild and crazy ideas are welcome and that no criticism of ideas is permitted. 
Also, encourage participants to build on or add to each other’s ideas. Most 
of the breakthroughs groups produce come from people springboarding off 
each other’s suggestions.
Introducing variations to improve results
Sometimes a brainstorming group is hesitant and holds back, leaving you 
standing at the flip chart without ideas to write down. When this happens, 
try running the group through another warm-up exercise or two. Try warm-
ups involving fantastic or humorous assignments, such as brainstorming 
ways to avoid taxes. If the group still holds back, try allowing individuals 
to express themselves anonymously. The following sections show you ways 
to do that and more.
Brainwriting
Make sure that each member of the group has a sheet of paper, a pen, and a 
comfortable place to write. Then ask them to write down five or more ideas 
as fast as they can, working in silence. After a few minutes, collect the papers 
and exchange them, so that each person gets someone else’s list. Ask them 
to read the ideas they’ve been given and add more ideas of their own. Repeat 
the process once more if you like, asking participants to read the lists of 
ideas aloud this time. Capture each unique idea on your flip chart, and transi-
tion to traditional brainstorming by encouraging group members to add more 
ideas verbally.
Pass-along brainstorming methods
In pass-along brainstorming, you trade your flip chart for a single sheet of 
paper that you send around the room, asking people to take turns writing on 
it. Write the focus (a problem, opportunity, or other mental challenge) on the 
top. Then pass it to the first person to your left and ask them to write down 
one idea. That person then passes it to the next person, who adds one idea, 
and so on around the room. Keep it going rapidly, through several cycles, to 
generate a long list. Then read or post the list for all to see and discuss.
A variation on pass-along brainstorming I tried recently and really liked is to 
turn the flip chart away from the center of the room and have participants 
walk past it, one at a time, adding their ideas to the hidden list. They can 
pass the marker among them as if it’s a relay race, and you can encourage a 
fun sense of urgency by timing how long it takes to generate 20 ideas. Getting 
them out of their seats seems to help them get in touch with their creativity.

115
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
 
For more pass-along methods (including the stuffy but well-known nominal 
group technique), see Chapter 7.
Fishbone brainstorming
Fishbone brainstorming uses a cause-effect diagram in the form of a fishbone 
to stimulate ideas about root causes of some outcome, usually a problem you 
want to solve. To use the technique, draw a large fish-skeleton diagram on a 
whiteboard or flip chart, with the front end for the effect and the rib bones 
for causes to be entered during the brainstorming. For example, the effect 
could be “Teeth don’t stay white” (a problem for consumers of whitening 
services and products). Ask the group to think of possible causes, and write 
each cause that isn’t directly related to another at the end of a separate 
fork of the effect diagram. Your fishbone diagram should look like the one in 
Figure 6-1.
For example, you might add labels such as “foods that stain,” “other sources 
of stains,” “inconsistent brushing,” “soft/porous enamel,” “incorrect use of 
treatments,” and “ineffective treatments.” The existence of multiple forking 
lines pushes the group to think of multiple causes. After you’ve labeled most 
or all of the main forks, you can drill down and explore each fork by adding 
smaller lines along it. For example, the label “foods that stain” might be given 
these sublabels: blueberries, coffee, tea, red wine, and colas. Figure 6-1 
illustrates the value of the fishbone for exploring this problem.

Often, the goal of fishbone brainstorming is to explore the causes of a prob-
lem to invent a good solution to the problem, so push the group to keep 
exploring causes until they gain insights that might lead to solutions. Then 
switch to brainstorming-style lists of ways to implement possible solutions. 

116
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
For example, the group addressing ways of keeping teeth white might come 
up with the idea of preventing foods and drinks from staining, which might 
then lead to ideas such as color-free versions of foods and drinks or products 
that protect the teeth while eating and drinking.
Mapping the ideas
The terms mind mapping and brain drawing are often used to describe loosely 
organized visual lists in which related ideas are clustered together, and their 
relationships to each other and the main idea are shown with straight or 
curving lines. The fishbone diagram is a way to map causal relationships, but 
a simple idea map uses a looser structure based on any and all associations 
or relationships between ideas.
You can use idea mapping to help the group expand its thinking. Start by 
drawing a large oval in the middle of the blank paper or board, and write the 
problem or challenge there. Then add — or allow each group member to add 
with his own marker or pen — any and all ideas that come up. Cluster similar 
ideas, separate unique ones, and use lines to symbolize the interrelation-
ships. Keep the visual symbols very simple so the map is easy to understand 
later on.
Loose relationships may be shown with dotted lines, while causal or 
directional relationships may be shown with arrows. Many software packages 
allow you to mind map on a computer (such as Microsoft’s Visio, Edraw’s 
Mindmap, and Mindjet’s Mindmanager), but they’re usually used to organize 
information rather than to generate creative ideas. I recommend using 
several large flip charts side by side or a large chalkboard or whiteboard 
so that the map can expand with ease. When the group runs out of steam, 
go over the map you’ve drawn at once, and convert the more interesting or 
useful ideas to an organized list. You may not be able to decipher the map in 
hindsight, because it’s likely to get complex or messy.
Random word technique
The idea behind this technique is to engage creative thinking by challenging 
people to find associations between apparently unrelated words and the 
problem or project they’re working on. For example, a group working on 
ways of improving customer service at an insurance company might be given 
the following random words and phrases: steering wheel, mailbox, cupcake, 
massage, garden, and iceberg. The facilitator would ask the group to try to 
relate one or more of these words to the problem. The group might come up 
with ideas such as
 
✓ Unhappy customers need to be “massaged” with lots of attention and 
special care until they feel relaxed and happy again.
 
✓ Customers should be celebrated and given special gifts (symbolized by 
cupcakes), so they know we care.

117
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
 
✓ Customers need to feel in control of their business relationship with 
their insurance company, so we should give them a virtual steering 
wheel in the form of a control panel on their computers that gives them 
the ability to manage all their insurance policies with ease.
It’s amazing how readily groups can come up with good insights based on 
seemingly unrelated, random words. Try it yourself. Can you turn the terms 
garden and iceberg into insights about customer service? I bet you can!
Considering additional creative processes
As you facilitate a creative group session, keep an eye on the group’s produc-
tivity. If they’re eager, engaged, and highly creative, all you need to do is keep 
them focused on the topic and record their ideas. You don’t need to provide 
a lot of structure.
Other groups need continuous encouragement to produce creative results. 
If your group is struggling to generate ideas, you’ll need to be more active in 
your facilitation. I’ve worked with groups who needed me to structure every 
moment and offer starter ideas of my own to show them what to do in each 
activity. Just keep using creative activities and have faith in the creative 
process. Even the most hesitant, quiet groups can and do produce useful 
insights if the facilitator is sufficiently encouraging and persistent!
Sometimes you need to switch from the intellectual and verbal to more physical 
and emotional creative activities. Brainstorming and its kin ask people to 
generate ideas and words. If the group seems unable to do so with ease, 
consider activities such as stretching, dancing to music, or drawing. I’m an 
artist as well as an author and consultant, so it’s natural for me to bring art 
into my facilitation.
Often, I ask a group to offer visual images that remind them of the problem 
or challenge at hand, and I draw these images for them on the board or on 
sticky chart sheets (3M makes giant Post-its that are great for this). I also 
invite members of the group to come up and draw their own images. Then 
we post them around the room and start adding lists of ideas that the images 
suggest to us. Art can be a wide-open back door to creative insights.
Wrapping it up
When the group has produced a wide range of ideas, wrap up the creative 
session by capturing the ideas clearly in writing. Then either transition to 
idea review and development or end the session (leaving it for another group 
or time to do the review and development work). You’ll almost always find a 
few nuggets that can be turned into valuable innovations in the coming weeks 
or months.

118
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Being a Brilliant Participant
Participants make the brainstorming session — or break it if they don’t 
participate appropriately. When you step into a group meeting and pull up a 
chair at the table, you can either wait and see whether the other people open 
up and start to offer ideas freely, or you can take the lead and start offering 
ideas right away. It’s helpful to be a creativity leader and start offering ideas 
and suggestions as soon as possible. In fact, by being one of the first to offer 
ideas, you may set the mood and make others feel comfortable offering their 
own ideas. It really takes just one or two brave participants to get a brain-
storming session rolling.
Contributing great ideas
So you want to take the lead by offering a bunch of ideas and showing the 
rest of the group how it’s done? Good! However, you may find that your idea 
well dries up just when you go to it with a desire to fill your mental bucket. 
There’s something fairly intimidating about the expectations that come along 
with being a participant in a brainstorming session. Often, people find that 
creative ideas just won’t bubble up the way they want them to.
If you feel that your creativity may fail you just when you want it the most, 
try these tricks to revitalize your innovative instincts:
 
✓ Close your eyes and withdraw for a minute, allowing yourself to relax 
and stop thinking. Concentrate on your breathing, if it helps you clear 
your mind. When you open your eyes, you may find fresh ideas welling up.
 
✓ Scribble some private notes on your own pad of paper to stimulate 
your imagination. A good exercise is to associate related or suggested 
words. Start by writing three to five words that are obviously related to 
the topic or problem. Then list three more words for each. As you write 
more words, allow yourself to make simple word associations based on 
rhymes or other qualities of the words themselves. For example, savings 
might suggest shavings, cravings, and paving. This exercise often frees 
the imagination.
 
✓ Ask questions. When you don’t have answers, asking questions is the 
natural thing to do. If the room is quiet and people are having trouble 
coming up with ideas, start asking open-ended questions that may help 
you or others see the problem from a fresh perspective.
 
✓ Ask the facilitator for examples. Sometimes all it takes are a few start-
ing ideas to get the brainstorming up and running.

119
 Chapter 6: Getting Juices Flowing in Brainstorming Sessions
 
Don’t sit at the table silently if your creativity is feeling blocked. Try to free it 
through one or more personal actions. If you can’t get your ideas flowing, 
raise your hand and tell the facilitator. It’s the facilitator’s responsibility to 
provide warm-ups and idea-generation processes that work for you.
Being an informal leader and cheerleader
You may contribute through two main activities during a group brainstorming 
session: suggesting ideas and encouraging others to suggest ideas. 
Sometimes the second role is more helpful than the first because it’s 
common for half or more of the group to be nervous about participating.
Use positive, open facial expressions such as smiles, nods, and interested 
expressions, along with short verbal encouragement (along the lines of 
“Great idea” and “Good thinking”), to let other participants feel that their 
contributions are helpful. Positive reinforcement from other participants may 
be more powerful than encouragement from the facilitator, especially when 
the facilitator is an outside consultant. As a peer, you may boost the comfort 
level in a brainstorming session simply by showing that you’re comfortable 
and eager to see the group produce.
Overcoming your own creative timidity
Some people express their creativity constantly in their day-to-day activities, 
but most people don’t. If you don’t use your creativity routinely, stepping 
into a brainstorming session may feel a little like standing up to perform in 
a crowded room. Stage fright may kick in, inhibiting your flow of ideas or 
making you hesitant to express them out loud. Here are some ways to over-
come your creative stage fright:
 
✓ Practice in advance or during the first break. Try to fill a page with 
creative ideas on any topic. Try one of these if you don’t have one of 
your own: how to save the earth from global warming, what the next big 
handheld device will be, or what to do about a lack of parking spaces 
downtown. Rehearsing the act of producing freely associated ideas 
will help you get ready to perform for the facilitator and in front of the 
group.
 
✓ Write ideas down on a piece of paper instead of saying them out loud. 
If the facilitator challenges or questions you about what you’re doing, 
explain that your ideas don’t seem to be flowing very well and you’re 
finding it hard to speak them out loud. Ask if the facilitator or another 
group member can review your list and share any good ideas from it 
with the rest of the group.

120
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
✓ Ask for clarification of the instructions. Make sure that the facilitator is 
asking for any and all ideas, including “bad,” “silly,” or “wild” ideas. Say 
that you don’t have any good ideas yet but that you can offer bad ones if 
the facilitator thinks it might be helpful for moving the group ahead.
 
 If the facilitator confirms that your ideas don’t have to be polished or 
refined, you’ll feel more comfortable with expressing whatever comes 
to mind, and so will those around you. Misery loves company, after 
all. Think about the metaphor of having to perform in public. It’s much 
easier when others are performing too, and the same holds true for voic-
ing creative associations.

hapter 6 shows you how to work with a group to generate creative ideas 
or options. It’s great to get a group together, close the door, and start 
brainstorming. But sometimes, you still come up short and need to try some 
more tricks. It’s important to keep going until you have at least one really 
great idea.
A group (or even individual) brainstorming session is often just the beginning 
of a creative thought process. You may want to challenge the group with 
additional creative activities. You may also want to go back to your desk (or 
somewhere more stimulating to the imagination) and try your hand at gener-
ating more ideas of your own.
Fortunately, the supply of creative processes and techniques is limitless. 
(One recent study documented more than 150 brainstorming techniques!) 
And if necessary, you can always invent more. You’re an innovator, after all.
This chapter shows you how to help yourself and others produce more and 
better ideas by using powerful tools and tricks that stimulate the imagination 
and tap into fresh new veins of thought. From creative ways to focus (or refocus) 
your brainstorming to visualization exercises, this chapter guides you in 
getting the most out of your group sessions.

Going the Distance to 
Cash In on Creativity
Usually, brainstorming starts with the simple question “Does anyone have 
any ideas about X?” Sure, people have ideas, and you can probably fill a large 
piece of chart paper, a whiteboard, or an electronic message board with 
these ideas — provided that you make sure everyone contributes; builds on 
others’ ideas; and remembers not to criticize any contributions, no matter 
how seemingly stupid or silly. Following is a typical starting list of brain-
stormed ideas; in this case, it’s ways to publicize a new shampoo brand.
How can we attract more attention to our new hair-care brand?
Get a celebrity to use it.
Give it to the ten most famous celebrities.
Give out trial-size bottles at top salons.
Raffle off a lifetime supply.
Give away a giant bottle.
Hide a coupon worth $1 million in one of a million bottles.
Make a movie about it called Sharleen in the Shampoo Factory.
 
When a group brainstorms, one idea leads to another and another, as the 
associative process takes hold and the group generates ideas freely. However, 
the list you produce may not be exactly what you need, just as the preceding 
list certainly isn’t the final word on how to market that new shampoo product. 
Usually, the first list of ideas is rough and preliminary. It may even be naïve. 
If you give up after the first round, you’ll probably convince everyone who 
participated that brainstorming is a waste of time. But it’s not. It gets the 
creative process started. Like most things of any great value, creativity takes 
time and effort. Persistence pays off. Impatience doesn’t. Don’t give up after 
one or two preliminary efforts to generate ideas. Plan to go through multiple 
rounds of idea generation, examination, and regeneration.
Critiquing the results of your brainstorming
It’s important to cycle between creative and critical thinking. That cycle is at the 
core of advanced idea-generation and design processes because it helps both to 
expand your creative thinking and to refine your ideas, solutions, and designs.
Often, it helps to take a critical look at the first round of creative ideas. 
A very simple and easy method is to ask everyone at the brainstorming 
session to cast anonymous votes for their favorite ideas. I’ve used the little-
round-sticker method many times for this purpose. Give each person six 

123
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
stickers. (I like to use the inexpensive kind you’d use to price garage-sale 
items, but you can use others if you have them on hand.) Let the participants 
allocate their six sticker-dots however they want — across six top ideas, or 
concentrated on one or a few favorites. Then create a table or bar chart of 
the ideas and the number of votes each received. Save the top ones (usually, 6 
to 12) for further research and development.
You may also want to research the options and evaluate them by using a 
more thoughtful, scientific approach. If there are technical issues, test or 
study them from a technical perspective and decide which ones are most 
practical. You might even make prototypes for advanced testing. If what 
matters most is whether prospective customers will like a design, survey 
customers to ask them what they think, using a well-executed picture of the 
proposed design.
Figure 7-1 shows the results of a customer survey in which 100 shampoo users 
were asked what they thought of a variety of possible designs for shampoo 
bottles. Each bottle was illustrated and described, and the respondents were 
asked to rank how much they liked each one. (See Chapter 8 for more ways 
of collecting customer input.) Clearly, the feedback from customers helps 
narrow down the list of possible package designs and helps the developers 
decide what approach to take to their new shampoo packaging.

Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
To the surprise of the design team, an Art Deco approach to the shampoo 
bottle design was the most popular concept with customers, and Art Deco 
colors came in second place. The team had been favoring a tropical palm tree 
look, but customers pointed them in a different direction.
The shampoo development team decided to do some research by collecting 
old-fashioned photographs from the 1920s to find out more about Art Deco 
and see how to base a new brand on a Deco aesthetic. They began to look 
closely at vintage waves and bobs, and they formulated a shampoo and con-
ditioner designed to help recreate those Art Deco looks. They also came up 
with the idea of packaging elegant Art Deco hair clips with trial packages of 
their shampoo and conditioner. The bottles were given a look akin to classic 
Art Deco buildings, and the label included a woman with bobbed hair and an 
elegant Art Deco dress in front of a Nash Ambassador Slipstream sedan. The 
name of the shampoo brand? Art Deco, of course!
Doing more research based on 
first-round questions
When I help companies generate ideas, I often find that my clients expect a 
full-blown solution or design to emerge from the first idea-generation session. 
Sorry, but it doesn’t usually work that way. Even if the first day of brainstorming 
does produce a really great concept, it’s still just a concept. It needs to be 
developed and refined, and there may be problems that need creative solu-
tions along the development path.
 
Many brainstorming sessions raise more questions than they answer. If you 
emerge from a brainstorming session with a handful of new questions that 
help clarify and focus your thinking, you’re doing pretty well!
 
I suggest that you keep a piece of chart paper taped up on the side of the 
room while leading a brainstorming session, with “Interesting questions to 
study” written across the top of it. As the brainstorming session goes on, 
periodically a question will come up that’s important to the thought process 
but hard to answer. Write it on that list of important questions.
At the end of the day, review the list of questions, edit or add to it as the 
group sees fit, and then assign the questions to volunteers from the group. 
Their job is to research their questions and report what they find out to the 
rest of the group. It’s amazing how often this research process produces the 
insight the group couldn’t quite reach during the brainstorming session.
Start your next session with the same list of questions, and have the team 
discuss the research findings. Then see whether a better design or solution 
to your problem comes to mind. Often, it does.

125
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
Being persistent
Quantity ensures quality, at least when it comes to ideas. There’s always 
debate about which (or whose) brainstorming techniques work best, but the 
one thing that’s crystal clear is that highly successful innovators are more 
persistent than other people. They generate more ideas by spending more 
time working on their design goals or problems. They have creative stamina, 
or the persistence born of the knowledge that innovative results are a factor 
of focused effort, not talent or intelligence.
A great way to ensure persistence and productivity in idea generation is to 
plan for multiple brainstorming sessions, using a variety of techniques. The 
more the better. And a great way to start is to use techniques that focus your 
imagination, such as a specific question or problem statement.
Focusing Your Brainstorming in 
Creative Ways
It’s difficult to see more and better options from just one viewpoint. Focusing 
and refocusing your view of the problem gives you fresh perspectives and 
fresh ideas. You can use a shift or narrowing of focus to generate more and 
different ideas. In fact, you ought to shift focus several times at least before 
you finish a brainstorming process. Otherwise, you may fall prey to the prob-
lem of fixation on one approach and fail to consider other possibilities.
Stimulating a shift in how people 
think about the topic
Shifting focus is a powerful way to get fresh ideas and insights. If you’re not 
sure how to shift the focus, start by brainstorming about that. Use one of the 
following as your problem statement for a brainstormed list of ideas:
 
✓ Define or approach this problem in some new ways.
 
✓ Come up with analogies for the problem or goal.
 
✓ Think of similar situations or challenges others have already conquered.
Imagine a business that has an old, deteriorating building that needs expensive 
repairs. A group has been asked to come up with recommendations for how 
to approach the repairs: which to do in what order, which projects have 
synergy, which can be deferred with the least risk, and so forth.

126
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
The facilitator of the meeting poses a focus-shift question: “Is there another 
way to look at the problem of an aging building we can’t really afford to keep 
up?” The group begins to brainstorm ideas, some of them silly and some 
potentially useful, such as
 
✓ Trade with some company that has a newer building and doesn’t realize 
ours is in bad shape.
 
✓ Burn it down for insurance.
 
✓ Move to a new location.
 
✓ Tear it down and replace it with a modern, more efficient building.
As the group discusses options, it comes to the realization that it’s inefficient 
and overly costly to keep patching up the old building and that, in fact, a 
replacement building might be a really good idea. It then shifts from the 
original task of writing a long-term maintenance plan to a new task: running 
the numbers to see whether moving to a better building might actually save 
money in the long run.
As in this example, prodding a group into considering a shift of focus is often 
immensely valuable. The mental thought process you go through when you 
find a new way to look at a topic is called reframing, and it has tremendous 
creative power because it opens up new lines of thought and action. Asking 
for new ways to look at a problem often produces a reframing of the original 
topic, which then leads to insights about how to approach it.
Fighting design fixation
Refocusing is especially important when the group (or individual) is guilty of 
design fixation — overly narrow assumptions about the nature of the answer 
or solution. Design fixation is very common, and it unintentionally narrows 
the focus of the group to just one family or style of possible answers.
For example, a group working on ways of designing more energy-efficient cars 
might be fixated on the idea that they have to design vehicles with two axles 
and four wheels: carlike designs. That could keep them from considering 
alternative forms, such as three-wheeled vehicles, vehicles with many extra 
wheels that act as flywheels to store energy, and hovercraft-type vehicles 
that have no wheels or that lift off their wheels at freeway speed, just to name 
a few of the alternatives that could be considered. Perhaps the single most 
energy-efficient transportation vehicle ever invented is the raft that runs on a 
canal between two major cities. Because rafts float, they require remarkably 
little energy to move. A freight-carrying raft on a canal may very well be the 
most “green” vehicle possible, but of course that old concept is not likely to 

127
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
be revived if everyone is fixated on carlike designs. (And what if you add a 
sail? Wind’s free and extremely planet-friendly!)
Design fixation is everywhere — and usually hidden within the story of a 
company whose fortunes have declined. The U.S. automakers were fixated on 
large, heavy vehicle designs back when the Japanese automakers first gained 
a significant share of the U.S. market with their light, energy-efficient designs. 
Detroit could have designed similar cars, but they didn’t because they just 
never gave the idea serious thought.
 
The best way to ensure that you aren’t overly fixated on one approach is to 
include a design-fixation check somewhere in the fairly early stages of your 
creative process. Pose the following challenge to the group (or to yourself, if 
you’re working alone):
Is there a radically different way to approach this problem?
Then brainstorm as many fundamentally different alternative approaches as 
you can. For example, instead of making an energy-efficient car for commuters, 
you might consider canal-borne rafts, mini-dirigibles, moving roadways 
like giant conveyor belts, car trains for small electric vehicles to ride on for 
longer legs of their journeys, wind tunnels, and so forth. Maybe in the end 
you’ll come back to an efficient hybrid electric-gas automobile, but at least 
by then you’ll be sure that you couldn’t have done it better by shifting to 
another family of possible solutions.
Sharpening the view with narrower 
problem definitions
Another powerful focusing technique involves drilling down to increasingly 
specific descriptions of what the problem or objective is. But how do you 
come up with these more specific strategies or approaches? Advance 
research helps — you can look for information about how others have tackled 
similar projects or problems. Also, you can always ask the group to help you 
brainstorm a list of general strategies and then conduct a second round in 
which you ask the group to develop specific ideas or designs for each strategy.
For example, you may start out with a broad goal such as “How can we boost 
revenue by at least 10 percent next year?” That sounds like an important 
objective for brainstorming, and it will certainly produce some suggestions. 
However, a broad question such as that tends to tap into fairly obvious 
answers and may fail to produce any fresh insights. Dig deeper for good ideas 
by narrowing the focus with more specific brainstorming topics, such as

128
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
✓ Can we turn one of our lesser-known products into a best-seller?
 
✓ Are there ways to upsell existing customers and get them to buy a lot 
more from us?
 
✓ What would we have to add to our products or services to justify a 10 
percent or higher price increase?
These more specific questions are based on possible strategies for accom-
plishing the overarching goal of increased revenue. There are lots of possible 
ways to increase revenue. If you focus the question by naming a specific 
strategy, you’re likely to get more ideas based on that strategy than you 
would get with the general statement of the goal.
Breaking the problem into 
smaller problems
Complex tasks are usually easy to break down into steps or stages. For 
example, the overall task of writing next year’s business plan can be divided 
into researching the market, collecting financial data, doing projections, and 
so forth. A team may list a dozen chores associated with business planning, 
divide the list among themselves, and then get together to integrate their 
separate contributions into one master document.
The same approach can be used for creative problem-solving and design. 
A great way to divide and conquer is to start with a broad question and 
then brainstorm narrower, more specific questions that nest beneath the 
starting question.
For example, if you want to introduce a new vacuum cleaner that doesn’t 
need to be plugged in, is good for the environment, has a very powerful 
motor, and not only cleans the floor but also filters the air, well, you might be 
as stuck for ideas as I am right now. Hmm. So break the problem down! You 
could start with a focus on motors. Are there any new motors that combine 
high power and small size with a very low use of energy to run? Maybe. If 
you find one, you can probably design a breakthrough product around it, so 
it’s a great question to focus your brainstorming. Finding a better motor is a 
nicely focused project that might be fairly easy to research — for instance, 
you could get in touch with industry experts and associations like the Small 
Motor and Motion Association.
As you break complex, open-ended problems or goals down, eventually 
you get to a level where the questions are so specific that they require less 
creative effort and are more easily solved through standard research tech-
niques. Then as you combine the specific findings from multiple, narrowly 
defined questions, you’re able to build up to a high level of creative design 
again, this time with a clearer idea of how you’ll accomplish the specifics.

129
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
Visualizing for Creative Success
A picture’s worth a thousand words, but most people brainstorm in words, 
not pictures. Try to work at least one or two visual techniques into every 
creative session to tap into more aspects of your creativity. You don’t have 
to be an artist to think visually. Here are some helpful ways to engage your 
visual thinking skills.
Introducing visual reference material
One great way to bring your visual thinking to bear on your challenge is 
to use visual images to stimulate your own and others’ thinking. Gather 
photographs, diagrams, or actual physical examples of ways others have 
approached similar problems. Sometimes, gathering great solutions to 
dissimilar problems is also helpful, just because it’s inspirational to see 
brilliant work in any field.
Spread the examples around your workspace or brainstorming room where 
your team can see them. Post pictures, plans, diagrams, and press clippings. 
React to these examples informally, just by seeing whether they suggest any 
ideas. If an informal approach fails to produce the results you want, pose 
formal questions about the examples, such as
 
✓ How many different ways have people tackled the solution of this problem?
 
✓ Could we combine the best from two or more of these examples to 
produce an even better option?
 
✓ Can we improve on the best of these designs?
 
✓ Can we adapt a clever solution to a different design problem and make 
it work for us?
These questions force the group to look at the images around them and pro-
cess them for creative inspiration. Often, the result is an avalanche of 
creative ideas.
Using imagery to stimulate the mind’s eye
Visual thinking can be done within the mind because we all have the capacity 
to visualize things, even if they aren’t right there in front of us. Analogies and 
metaphors are helpful in stimulating visual thinking.
Challenge the group to paint brief verbal pictures that represent the problem. 
For example, they might think of a budgeting problem as being like “trying 
to carry too much weight on a small boat.” Their effort to think visually may 

130
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
help them see new approaches and alternatives, because visual thinking 
often helps boost creativity.
Sketching ideas rather than 
describing them
Imagine you can’t use words. How will you communicate an idea to others? 
You might draw a map or floor plan, a diagram or flowchart of a process, or 
a picture of a design for a new product or tool. Prehistoric cave drawings 
communicate to us today, showing us how hunters surrounded large animals 
and brought them down with multiple spears — an important innovation in 
its day. People have been sketching their ideas for a long time. It’s a powerful 
way to communicate ideas, as well as to think of them in the first place.
 
Sketch pads and boxes of fine-tipped colored markers belong in every brain-
storming session and ought to be used for at least one round of no-words-
allowed brainstorming. Ask people to generate a sketch of an idea and then have 
them take turns explaining their ideas to the rest of the group. Figure 7-2 shows 
a good format for sketching rough ideas on chart pads, in which the sketch is 
accompanied by brief explanatory text. Very often, a round of idea drawing pro-
duces fresh insights that you can develop into useful designs or plans.

 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
Building solutions from standard 
geometric shapes
I sometimes draw a series of neat geometric shapes on the board or chart 
pad and challenge pairs of participants to design solutions to the problem, 
using only these shapes plus their imagination. Don’t force the group to be 
too literal, because the goal is to stimulate fresh, imaginative thinking.
Some design elements you can offer include small and large circles, squares, 
wedges, rectangles, rods, cones, boards, and belts and elastic bands of various 
sizes. You can offer a simple list of shapes or draw the shapes on the board 
or chart pad. Instruct teams of two to four to imagine that they’re going to 
build something that solves the problem at hand. They can give the shapes 
specific properties to meet their design needs. A circle can be a tire, steering 
wheel, timing wheel, gear, or anything else they need it to be that’s circular. 
They may also use as many repetitions of each shape as they want.
A simple but potentially profitable design concept came out of a shape-
brainstorming session with the goal of inventing new products for office or 
household use. The concept this team came up with was a set of mugs, each 
of which has a unique geometric shape so that people don’t get confused 
about which one is theirs.
The results of shape brainstorming are almost always highly imaginative. After 
you run a shape-brainstorming session, have each group show its drawing 
and explain how it works. Then ask them to identify elements from the imagi-
native design drawings that they would like the real design or solution to 
have. From this list, begin to develop a real-world design.
Storyboarding an idea
A storyboard is a piece of poster paper that has a cartoon-style series of drawings 
and captions or speech bubbles. The format is often used in the advertising 
industry to show an idea for a television ad. It’s also great for showing how 
you think customers might use a new product you’re considering or how a 
newly designed service function might interact with customers.
 
Whenever you’re working on a process that has people doing things, a story-
board can be used to tell the story of how the interaction might go.
For a fun and potentially helpful alternative, draw simple comic-book-style 
pages showing people working with or consuming a new invention or product. 
Then share the story with associates or a group you’ve assembled to brain-
storm with you, and get their reactions. Showing has much more impact than 
telling and often generates rich feedback and suggestions.

132
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Making small-scale models
Nothing is quite as helpful as a model of a new design that you and others 
can see, pick up, and handle. Architects often build balsa wood models of 
proposed buildings for their clients to examine and critique. Sometimes, 
the client realizes he doesn’t like an element of the design when he sees it 
in three dimensions rather than just on the blueprints. Depending on what 
you’re designing, you might use balsa wood, glue, paper, tape, flexible plastic 
sheets, or heavier materials requiring a wood or metal shop to help you.
 
If you need to impress someone, a sophisticated model is needed. But if you 
simply want to get reactions to a design concept, a simple, inexpensive, rough 
model will do.
Using sticky notes and a wall 
for your brainstorming
You can morph verbal brainstorming into a visual medium by using 
sticky notes.
To show you how sticky notes can help a group visualize solutions, imagine 
the case of a seaside hotel that does very well in summer but loses money in 
winter. The manager wants to generate ideas for drawing off-season guests 
and increasing utilization in the winter. Figure 7-3 shows a sticky-note brain-
storming session. First, the facilitator posts a sticky note with an objective. 
Next, he chooses a list of random words out of a dictionary (see “Generating 
ideas from random words” later in this chapter) and writes them on sticky 
notes that he puts up on a wall in an “inventory” area.
Then the facilitator forms his group into creative pairs whose instructions 
are to select one random word and brainstorm ideas from it. Group members 
are told to associate possible strategies — no matter how wild or crazy the 
idea — and write them on sticky notes. Then they place their notes next to 
the random words that stimulated each idea.
As the members of the group post their idea notes, they or others may asso-
ciate new ideas with the posted ones. If so, they’re told to post their new 
ideas next to the ones that gave them the ideas. That way, the sticky notes 
grow along the associative pathways of the group’s creative thinking. (See 
the next section for other ways to map ideas based on their relationships.)

Drawing a mind map
Mind maps can be used by individuals or groups to brainstorm new ideas. 
A mind map is a visual approach to taking notes in which you use lines or 
arrows to show the connections between concepts, facts, questions, and 
ideas. When you use mind maps to organize notes (a practice proven to 
improve student recall when studying), the arrows should reflect a logical 
structure for the content. However, when you use mind maps to brainstorm 
new ideas, the arrows indicate the associative pathways your thinking takes.
Figure 7-4 shows how a group uses a mind map to think about new product 
concepts for the coffee industry. It shows how you can use big questions, or 
questions that suggest important avenues of thought (they’re shown in italic 
in the figure), as well as a variety of smaller questions and ideas organized in 
natural thought clusters.
As your mind map grows, it may be necessary to expand it by adding more 
sheets of paper. I recommend using very large sticky pads. A few sheets of 
them can turn a wall into a mind-mapping center, allowing multiple people to 
work simultaneously. However, when I mind map by myself (a practice I often 
use when I want to find new approaches to a subject), I use large drawing 
pads or, if I don’t have one at hand, 11-x-17-inch sheets of paper on a confer-
ence table, taping sheets together if my map gets too big for the first one. I’ve 
sometimes used as many as six or eight sheets as I expand my thinking.

Combining research with mind mapping
Mind mapping raises as many questions as it does ideas and proposals. 
Having a research tool at hand to answer those questions is very helpful. 
If your inquiry is general in nature, Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org) or 
some form of encyclopedia may be useful. Also, you can invite experts such 
as chemists, engineers, or doctors to your mind-mapping session so as to 
have ready access to special expertise that can be integrated into the mind 
map. That way, your mind map is smarter than any of the individuals in the 
room and combines both their knowledge and their ideas.
In Figure 7-4, you can see how certain facts about coffee work their way into 
the mind map. Someone looked up alternative sources of milk, and someone 
else discovered a new species of coffee that raises the possibility of producing 
naturally uncaffeinated coffee with all the flavor of regular coffee.
You can use research to provide the structure for brainstorming solutions to 
a problem. Study the topic to learn what the principal approaches are. These 
become the general categories that you brainstorm within.
The example in Figure 7-5 concerns a workplace in which the management 
team wants to try to prevent the seasonal flu from spreading widely and 
infecting so many people that productivity is hurt. Their initial research sug-
gests that three main categories of strategies might be productive: education, 

135
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
prevention, and containment. They then brainstorm possible ways to use 
each of these strategies in their own workplace. Their approach involves the 
use of sticky notes arranged in columns under the three main categories.
Using mind-mapping software
Concept development is a fairly simple challenge for mind mapping — all you 
really need is a lot of paper and markers to do it. But when you have a good 
concept, if you want to do another mind map to help you design it, you’ll find 
yourself getting into a lot of specifics that can be hard to organize and keep 
track of. Enter mind-mapping software.
The size of a virtual page is unlimited, and software programs can keep track 
of all the ideas and information, including much more detailed information 
than you’d want to write out by hand. The latest software programs allow 
you to integrate electronic documents and Web links into your mind maps, 
making them extremely rich and detailed.
Some of the mind-mapping software programs allow shared use, so you can 
have a virtual team working on a mind map from distant locations. The facili-
tation can be a bit tricky, but it’s interesting to see what you can generate as 
you cooperate with far-flung participants.

The Compendium Institute offers shareware for download from its Web site, 
compendium.open.ac.uk. FreeMind is another popular open-platform 
program. It’s available for download at freemind.sourceforge.net/
wiki/index.php/Main_Page. Commercial products include iMindMap 
(www.imindmap.com), Mindjet’s MindManager (www.mindjet.com), and 
NovaMind’s Mind Mapping Software (www.novamind.com/mind-mapping).
Clustering ideas and suggestions
A variant of mind mapping involves the initial generation or collection of lots 
of ideas, suggestions, and other helpful thoughts and bits of information, fol-
lowed by an effort to cluster them into groups based on their relatedness. 
You can use a formal outline structure for organizing the ideas, but it’s so 
linear that it doesn’t lend itself to innovative thinking very well. That’s where 
the mapping comes in. Cluster the ideas visually instead of putting them in an 
outline or table, and see what insights the effort produces.
I like to use index cards for the first step of a cluster-brainstorming session. 
Hand out a small stack of index cards to each participant. Then ask the par-
ticipants to generate ideas, questions, or related facts — one per card. Let 
them work individually (a variation on the nominal group technique; see 
“Using index cards and the nominal group technique” later in this chapter), 
or have them work in breakout groups of two to four. You can even run a 
general brainstorming session, but have the facilitator write each suggestion 
on a card rather than on a board or chart pad.
When you have 30 or more index cards filled with ideas, gather the group 
around a large table and begin to seek order. What are the natural clusters of 
cards? Lay them out as best you can, trying to find group consensus as you 
go. What you’re doing is actually an intuitive version of a statistical technique 
called cluster analysis, in which variables that correlate with one another 
are grouped to reveal underlying relationships and patterns. Your cluster 
map may reveal interesting groups or connections, too. It most certainly will 
stimulate more ideas, which you can add to the map, just as you would when 
doing a regular mind map (refer to the earlier section “Drawing a mind map”).
Producing insights and proposals 
from your mind map
The mind map itself is not the end product. After the mind-mapping or cluster-
brainstorming session is over, sit down on your own or with one or two associ-
ates to mine the map. Examine it for interesting ideas, fresh insights, or new 
ways to focus your research and development. Make a list of the promising 
outcomes. Decide who will follow up on each one, how, and when.

137
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
In fact, the journalist’s classic set of questions may be applied: who, what, 
when, where, why, and how? If you answer each of these questions, you’ll 
always have a clear idea about who’s doing follow-up, when, where, and so 
forth. Create a summary action plan to e-mail participants with their who-
what-where-when-why-how assignments.
The “why” is especially important as it defines the imagined benefits and 
helps clarify the potential importance of the work. I like to create a blank 
table with room to write the question or proposal at the top and with empty 
columns for each of the journalist’s six questions. Fill in one of these tables 
for each promising finding from your brain-mapping exercise (or from any 
brainstorming activity), give the tables to appropriate individuals for follow-
up, and gather again for a debriefing on their findings in a week or so.
 
Follow-up is key when it comes to preliminary, free-minded brainstorming 
activities like mind mapping. Without it, all you’ve done is exercise your imagi-
nation, which isn’t a bad thing to do, but it’s better to harness the energy of 
that work to produce an actual, innovative outcome.
Maximizing the Power of Team Thinking
Creative teams are organized groups of people focusing on generating ideas, 
designs, or solutions for a common problem or goal; they bring together 
the diverse experiences, knowledge, and ideas of many people. Most people 
believe that a group will easily produce more and better ideas than an 
individual, which is why we form groups when we have creative challenges.
The whole idea of brainstorming is that a group should be more productive 
than an individual. However, that common belief is as much myth as fact. Quite 
a few studies have shown that individuals brainstorming on their own are more 
productive on average than groups. The psychologists who study this stuff even 
have a term for this misplaced faith in the group: illusion of group productivity. 
Groups don’t usually produce as many creative ideas as they think they will, 
nor are those ideas as good as they anticipate. Most of their participants fail to 
generate a high number of ideas. What can you do to make sure that your groups 
are highly productive? The following sections outline some of the many good 
ways to get a real, live group to produce at a high level.
Using index cards and the 
nominal group technique
The nominal group technique (NGT) involves the individuals of a group writ-
ing their ideas on slips of paper, which are then gathered and shared with the 
group for voting, discussion, or other purposes. Traditionally, NGT has been 
used effectively for group decision-making.

138
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Here’s how to take a vote by using NGT:
 
1. Have each individual write down his first choice plus a supporting 
argument for it.
 
2. Have each member privately rank all the proposed solutions.
 
3. Tally the rankings.
 
 The winning proposal emerges.
You can also use an NGT approach to generate ideas and share them with 
the group:
 
1. Pose a question or challenge, just as if you were initiating a brain-
storming session.
 
2. Pass out index cards or sheets of paper.
 
3. Have everyone write their ideas down in silence.
 
 This differs from the brainstorming session in which you call on people 
to voice their ideas.
 
4. Gather the first crop of ideas, and transcribe them (minus duplicates) 
onto a chart pad at the front of the room.
 
5. Hand out more cards and gather another round of ideas.
 
 These ideas will be richer because group members will be inspired by 
each others’ thinking.
 
6. Repeat the gathering and summarizing of information.
 
7. Transition to yet another round of index card notes or to a traditional 
brainstorming session or discussion.
Creative chitchat
One simple but effective way to make people 
produce more in group sessions is to have 
them participate in an electronic chat room, 
where they all post their ideas as fast as they 
can type, and every idea is visible to all who are 
invited to the chat. Research shows that elec-
tronic groups are often more productive than 
actual live ones. Probably the social influences 
of others’ presence are lessened, reducing 
production blocking or the self-censorship of 
creative thought and expression. To make a 
chat room brainstorm effective, invite an appro-
priate group, brief them in advance, and stay in 
the chat room yourself to facilitate. You may 
need to ask a participant to avoid criticism of 
others’ ideas, for example. Chat rooms are great 
places to generate input and ideas, but be care-
ful not to discuss proprietary information online.

139
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
When you think you have a good crop of ideas based on quantity (at least 30) 
and quality (a wide range of approaches including many unexpected ones), 
transition to a critical evaluation of the ideas. This can be done in one of 
two ways:
 
✓ Unstructured: Simply ask the group to discuss the ideas and try to reach 
a consensus regarding their favorites.
 
✓ Structured: Hand out index cards once again, this time with the instruc-
tion to identify and rank the top three ideas. As you hand out the cards, 
tell group members to give three points to their first-place choice, two 
to their second, and one to their third. That way, the top choice gets the 
most points, not the least.
Gather the rankings, tally them, and see which ideas got the most and highest 
votes. To compute the winners, add the numbers assigned by each member to 
each idea (three for a first-place ranking, plus two for a second-place ranking, 
and so forth). The idea with the highest total points is the group’s top choice.
The NGT produces more and richer contributions from group members when 
there are pressures that might keep members from participating fully in a 
regular brainstorming session, such as the following:
 
✓ Some group members tend to dominate the discussion.
 
✓ Some group members are introverted and think better in silence.
 
✓ People are new to your team and uncomfortable with freely sharing 
their ideas.
 
✓ A supervisor’s presence inhibits verbal sharing of ideas.
 
✓ Controversy or politics is likely to get in the way of open conversation.
Even if these factors don’t seem to be present, I still recommend doing a 
round or two of NGT just to increase the productivity of your group. Mix it 
up with traditional brainstorming to maximize creative production.
Using pass-along brainstorming
Another great way to alter the creative dynamics and shake free a few more 
good ideas is to pass a piece of paper around the room, allowing each group 
member to add her own thought to the bottom of a growing list.
 
I don’t recommend this as your primary brainstorming method, because it 
sidelines most of the group while one person writes, but as a quick way to 
change the dynamics, it can be quite useful.

140
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Pass a tough question around the room
Write a thoughtful question at the top of the top sheet of paper on a lined 
pad. A question requiring creative thinking, not a technical or logical 
response, works best. Then pass it around the room, allowing each person 
to contribute his thoughts in turn. At the end, read the entire list and then 
open the floor for discussion. Sometimes, ideas will build up as each person 
takes turns writing, and a fresh approach will arise. If this happens, switch to 
a verbal discussion or begin to sketch or diagram at the front of the room to 
see whether the idea can be implemented to meet your needs.
Tell stories about strategic success
Sometimes, writers experiment by using pass-along brainstorming to write a 
short plot synopsis or story. They take turns contributing a sentence, a para-
graph, or even a whole chapter. How will the story develop? None of them 
knows, but somehow, the story does develop, climax, and resolve, and inter-
esting characters develop. The group-writing process can produce creative 
twists and turns that surprise the contributors.
I’ve adapted pass-along storytelling to the strategic planning process by 
having participants in a planning retreat take turns contributing to a story 
about a successful new innovator in their industry. The ideas that may 
surface when you engage people’s imagination in this way can be amazing. 
Sometimes, one of the fictional, winning strategies works its way into the 
strategic plan, showing how imaginative exercises can bring to the surface 
fresh ideas that produce innovations.
Pass along a brainstormed list by e-mail
I sometimes use an e-mail version of pass-along brainstorming in advance of 
a creative session. It avoids the problem you have in a group of most people 
doing nothing while one person writes.
When you circulate a question by e-mail, you’re really just adapting the old-
fashioned chain letter to modern electronic brainstorming. Provide a circula-
tion list at the bottom of the e-mail, with instructions for each person in the 
chain to add her ideas and then pass the e-mail on to the person whose name 
follows hers.
Put your own name at the bottom of the list (assuming you’re the facilitator) 
so the accumulated ideas make their way back to you. Then clean up the list 
and print copies of it as a handout or blow it up as a poster to share when 
your group assembles in person. Or if you’re not assembling the group in 
person, e-mail the master list back to all participants with a thank-you note 
that includes a brief description of how you’re using their input.

141
 Chapter 7: Mastering Advanced Brainstorming
 
Ask your pass-along e-mail participants to offer suggestions for creative or 
analytical questions that might help clarify the right approach to the project. If 
you use the pass-along method to develop a list of insightful questions, you 
can then do some research and gather information of relevance to each ques-
tion. Bring the information to the brainstorming session, along with the master 
list of the questions, to provide the group with a research base that helps 
them with their thinking.
Generating ideas from random words
The random-word technique uses randomly selected words from a source such 
as a dictionary to stimulate fresh thinking. The idea behind this technique is to 
engage creative thinking by challenging people to find associations between 
apparently unrelated words and the problem or project they’re working on. 
Figure 7-3 illustrates a random-word brainstorm, using sticky notes to mind 
map the associations.
Working individually, too!
Sometimes, I find that people are hesitant to innovate the old-fashioned way: 
by holing up somewhere with lots of research (such as background information, 
technical requirements, and examples of failed approaches) and persisting until 
they finally come up with a breakthrough. The fact is, sometimes you can run 
brainstorming sessions, ask for e-mail input, and consider dozens of employee 
suggestions and still not have a really great idea. That’s when it’s time to put 
on your own thinking cap and close and lock your office door (or studio — see 
Chapter 1 for ideas on how to create your perfect creative space).
Cycle between private and group work
Don’t be afraid to turn away from group processes, ignore others who want 
to be helpful but don’t seem to be moving things ahead, and just plain think 
about the problem. Persistence is certainly the single most powerful creative 
technique, and anybody can use it if they are, well, persistent enough. If you 
go off and think really hard about a problem and then come back with fresh 
ideas or insights, you may be able to refocus the group in a new, more 
productive direction and get better input from them.
In my experience, the leader of a creative process or the facilitator of a 
creative group needs to do some hard thinking of her own. Don’t leave it to 
the group to come up with a breakthrough.

142
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Contribute extra ideas after you’ve left the session
Individual work parallel to the group is valuable even if you’re not leading 
the group but are just one of many participants. Take the project or problem 
home with you; incubate it overnight; and try your hand at a list of ideas, a 
design sketch, or another form of solution the next morning. It’s amazing how 
often the really good idea waits until the brainstorming session is over to pop 
into your head. Try to send in at least one high-quality idea within several 
days after a brainstorming event.
If you plan on following up with additional ideas, you’ll probably keep think-
ing about the topic, at least subconsciously, and a great idea is likely to sud-
denly leap to the forefront of your mind.
 
I spent three days brainstorming new breakfast-cereal concepts for Kellogg’s 
and was very proud of the lengthy list of ideas our group produced for them. 
However, in the years after that session, I’ve actually come up with a number 
of even better ideas. The intense immersion in the topic primed me to think 
about it, and I guess I’ve been incubating it ever since. For example, my 5-year-
old daughter loves cereal with milk and maple syrup, and so do I. It occurred 
to me this morning at breakfast that a Maple Krispies product could include 
small pieces of maple-sugar candy shaped like maple leaves that melt into the 
milk. Yum!
I checked Kellogg’s Web site (www.kelloggs.com) and found that they 
have an open-innovation system called Great Ideas (click Great Ideas on their 
home page or go to www2.kelloggs.com/GreatIdeas/default.aspx). 
So I entered my product proposal on their Web site, and now I’m going to 
keep an eye on the grocery store shelf to see whether it pops up. I’m no 
longer under contract so I won’t profit from the idea, but I’ll still feel great if it 
gets adopted. See Chapter 8 for ways of enlisting volunteers like me through 
crowdsourcing. People love to share their ideas!

A
n old expression whose origins I can’t guess at says, “There’s more than 
one way to skin a cat.” I don’t want to skin any cats, but I do recall that 
saying whenever I feel stuck and unable to come up with the breakthrough 
idea I need for my own business or for one of my clients. Brainstorming (see 
Chapter 6) and its variants (such as the nominal group technique and concept 
sketching; see Chapter 7) are powerful ways of stimulating the imagination 
and focusing it on useful innovations. You can use alternative approaches, 
however — lots of them! This chapter helps you find new ways to bump up 
your own imagination, as well as the creativity of a group.
Using Customer Input for Inspiration
Many innovations have to do with product development, service improve-
ment, or other matters with a marketing or sales orientation. If you’re inter-
ested in improving what you sell or inventing something new to sell, try 
asking your customers for ideas, suggestions, or — even better — 
complaints. Why? Customer complaints give you insight into things that 
seem like problems to your customers, and problems for your customers are 
opportunities for you!

144
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
Collect and save all customer complaints so that you can dip into the file to see 
what’s bugging your customers. If a lot of complaints have to do with lost or 
late shipments, you can conclude that you need to innovate the way that you 
ship products to your customers. If the complaints are more about the 
products and what they do (or don’t do), you see that product innovation 
is in order.
Organizing a focus group
Sometimes, you need to stimulate customers to give you more specific or 
deeper input than you can get from casual complaints. After all, customers 
usually don’t put much thought into ways to make your business more 
successful, so if you want their ideas, you have to ask them.
A common — and highly effective — way to get customer assistance is to 
gather a group of customers in a conference room (usually, you have to offer 
them some cash and/or free products as an incentive), show them a series of 
new product concepts, and ask them for their reactions.
You can gather customers yourself or hire a market research firm to do it, 
in which case you’ll be shopping for what the research industry calls a focus 
group. The research firm will help you decide what kinds of customers you 
want in the room and will not only get them there, but also provide a profes-
sional moderator and a recording, plus a written summary of the findings.
These formal focus groups are often useful for evaluating product concepts 
that are already fairly well developed. If you want input and suggestions for 
new products, however, a less formal (and cheaper) do-it-yourself group may 
be for you.
To run an informal focus group, invite customers you know already, because 
they’re likely to be easy to assemble and eager to help. Offer a half dozen to 
a dozen of your good customers breakfast or lunch, and ask them to commit 
to two hours of conversation about your products and services. If you don’t 
have a good meeting facility in your offices, rent a conference room at a 
nearby hotel, and arrange for the hotel to cater the meal.
When the group is assembled, thank everyone for coming, and explain that 
you’ll be asking them to share their ideas, suggestions, and criticisms to help 
you design a new product, improve customer service, or meet some other 
worthy goal that customers would find beneficial. Go to a whiteboard or 
chart pad on an easel, and write the topic at the top. Then go directly into 
facilitating a brainstorming session.

145
 Chapter 8: Going Beyond Brainstorming
Capture any and all comments and suggestions, and use enthusiastic, positive 
body language and verbal praise so your customers feel that their input is 
valuable — whether you think it is or not! It’s essential to produce a 
positive customer experience, because these people, after all, are your good 
customers. Praise and feed them well, and send them thank-you notes after-
ward. Also, if any ideas from the session get implemented, let the people who 
came up with them know; they’ll be thrilled to learn that their input was useful.
Asking customers to fantasize about 
their ultimate product
Ask your customers about their fantasies for your products. It’s a great way 
to come up with fascinating new ideas and possibilities for product develop-
ment. You can ask individual customers one on one when the opportunity 
arises, or you can send e-mail requests to your whole customer list. You 
might even hold a contest on your Web site (sending a press release to the 
media to announce it) in which you solicit the most imaginative fantasy 
product in your product category.
Suppose that you could have the ultimate watch — one that could easily 
do anything and everything you might want it to do. What would it be like? 
Hmm. Let’s see. Well, just telling the time isn’t really that exciting in this 
day and age, because your cellphone, laptop, car, and microwave all tell the 
time quite accurately. But the watch of your dreams might do more exciting 
and useful things. Perhaps it would include a mini-GPS (Global Positioning 
System) chip that would keep you from getting lost, remind you if you’re 
about to miss an important appointment, and prompt you to pick up flowers 
to take home for your wife on your anniversary. In other words, your fantasy 
watch would keep you oriented in many ways besides time.
Nobody’s asked me to describe my own ultimate watch so far, but if a watch-
maker were to do so, she might come up with interesting ideas for new 
product development.
Inviting customer input, both 
critical and creative
Invite customers to give you feedback or review a new design, either via 
one-on-one e-mail communication or in an informal focus group (refer to 
“Organizing a focus group” earlier in this chapter). What customers should 
you ask to evaluate design options or new product concepts? You might want 

146
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
to ask just a representative sample of typical customers. Those people are the 
ones you want to sell to, after all. Asking the average customer is great if you 
simply want to see whether people like and think they’d buy a new design.
When you survey typical customers about their reactions to a new product 
design, have them rate the appeal of the design (as I discuss in Chapter 7) 
and also ask them to make choices. If they had to choose, would they buy 
your new design or one of the leading products already on the market? By 
asking members of your sample group to make choices, you simulate a shopping 
experience and may get more accurate information about how customers will 
react to your new design.
 
Another approach is to talk to lead users — sophisticated customers who can 
offer unusual insights on customer needs and wants. In business to business 
(B2B) sales, your sales force or sales reps can tell you who the lead users are 
because they stand out as being more sophisticated and successful than most. 
If you don’t have personal contact with your customers, you may need to talk 
with a mailing-list broker about strategies for finding the most sophisticated 
users and contacting them to see whether any are willing to help.
Talk to the smartest, best customers when you want design ideas, not just 
simple reactions to completed designs. Lead users often suggest new designs 
or products that you can refine and introduce to the market with great success, 
as 3M has done. In B2B marketing, lead users are top companies that are 
innovators themselves; these companies can offer interesting ideas and 
suggestions to their suppliers.
Redesigning Processes
Process design is easiest when you work visually, which means process 
mapping or flowcharting. This method is great if you’re working on a problem 
or challenge that involves a system, such as how to improve the quality of 
customer service in a hotel. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., in fact, has used 
process flowcharting to great effect in improving the quality and reducing 
the cost of customer service.
To map and then redesign your own processes, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a diagram that uses standardized symbols.
 
 These symbols could include ovals for the start and end of the process, 
arrows for directional movement between steps in the process, rectangles 
for each step, and diamonds for choices or decisions (with two or more 
arrows going out of them to represent the options).

147
 Chapter 8: Going Beyond Brainstorming
 
 Figure 8-1 shows a simple flowchart for a call to the front desk from a hotel 
guest. This flowchart might be the initial one that you’d draw after asking a 
group to explain how a call from a guest to the front desk is handled.

2. Ask the group to discuss the initial drawing and decide whether it 
leaves anything out.
 
 Often, the first drawing proves to be overly simplistic. Figure 8-1, for 
example, doesn’t explain what happens if the guest needs a hotel engineer 
to perform a repair or if the front desk can’t handle the request. Nor does 
it show when the desk staff should pass on a difficult caller to a manager. 
More steps and options must be added to make the diagram complete.
 
3. Continue to expand and correct the drawing until you have what 
appears to be a complete flowchart of the way things are done now.
 
 When the current process has been fully flowcharted, it will be much 
easier for the group to study and improve it.
 
 If necessary, create secondary flowcharts showing how hand-off pro-
cesses work. To continue the example shown in Figure 8-1, what does 
housekeeping do when the front desk passes a call to it?
 
4. Point to any step in the flowchart, and ask the group about ways to 
improve it.
 
 You could ask questions such as these:
 
• What could go wrong here?
 
• Could someone else handle this task better?
 
• Why is this step done this way?
 
• Could we take any steps out of this process to simplify it?

148
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
• Where do things go wrong in this process most often?
 
• Are there better ways to perform any of the steps?
 
 Encourage group members to ask their own critical and creative 
questions too.
 
5. Based on the group’s feedback, use the flowchart symbols to diagram 
possible alternative designs.
 
 In the hotel example shown in Figure 8-1, it may make sense to reduce 
the number of times that the front desk hands off customer calls. Hand-
offs frustrate customers and introduce the possibility of problems such 
as dropped calls or busy signals.
The visual quality of the flowchart diagrams will help your group (or you, if 
you’re working individually) to see many possibilities that are hard to imagine 
in the abstract.
Taking Advantage of E-Mail
Of the millions of e-mails sent and received every day, very few ask for 
creative input. How many times have you received an e-mail saying, “What 
do you think about X? Can you please send me some ideas?”
Why don’t we use e-mail to generate ideas? That simply isn’t part of the 
convention for the medium. E-mail is used as a vehicle for telling or asking 
people to do things, catching up with people, complaining about what people 
have done, or sharing general information efficiently. It usually isn’t used for 
brainstorming. E-mail is a really, really good medium for generating ideas, 
however, because e-mail makes it so easy to contact people wherever they 
are and ask for their input.
Including a provocative 
question or situation
“What if…?” e-mails are good for generating fresh ideas. To create such an 
e-mail, you could use “Request for creative suggestions” as your Subject 
line; introduce the e-mail by explaining that you’re asking for help on brain-
storming initial ideas, including impractical or fanciful ideas; and then offer a 
scenario (a short what-if story) about your topic that imposes some kind of 
limitation and asks, “What would you do if you couldn’t . . . ?” or something 
like that.

149
 Chapter 8: Going Beyond Brainstorming
The limitation is a form of provocation — a mental challenge that stimulates 
fresh thinking. If you don’t provoke creative thinking somehow, your e-mail 
replies will simply be the same old thoughts that people usually have.
 
The Commonwealth Fund, a charitable foundation in New York City that 
focuses on ways to improve the healthcare system, sent e-mails to pediatri-
cians asking them how they would provide well-child care if a disease (such as 
a bad flu strain) closed down the outpatient medical offices that they normally 
used to see their patients. Doctors came up with lots of ideas for delivering 
routine healthcare to children without using their offices, such as providing 
services in schools, through TV broadcasts and Web sites, and via parent 
training. Although the actual scenario is unlikely to happen, many of the ideas 
were of general interest because they could supplement the current system of 
patient care.
The main point of interest for the purposes of this discussion is this: 
Hundreds of health professionals answered The Commonwealth Fund’s 
e-mail. The foundation collected numerous suggestions without having to 
gather a group of people and run a time-consuming, potentially costly brain-
storming session. You can take advantage of the economy and ease of e-mail 
brainstorming too.
Designing your e-mail for 
thoughtful consideration
Make sure that your e-mail has clear signals that mark it as an open-minded 
request for creative input so that it isn’t handled like a normal e-mail. 
Normally, people spend fewer than 30 seconds replying to each e-mail, so 
to generate useful ideas from the recipients of your e-mail, you have to slow 
them down and get them to think about your question for at least a minute.
Here are a few ways to get recipients’ thoughtful attention:
 
✓ Make the case that it’s important to get the recipient’s help. Include 
a brief (one to three sentences) description of the situation, explaining 
why you need creative ideas now and what you’ll do with those ideas to 
solve a problem or improve a situation.
 
✓ Use a provocation, such as an unusual scenario or examples of cre-
ative ideas that the recipient can use as a springboard. For more 
information on provocation, see the preceding section.
 
✓ Specifically ask for at least a minute of undivided attention 
and thought.
 
✓ Give the recipient a short time frame for replying (such as within the 
day or the week).

150
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
✓ Include five to ten times as many people in the e-mail list as you’d 
invite to an actual brainstorming session. When you solicit ideas by 
e-mail rather than in person, you’ll get fewer ideas, because e-mail 
recipients won’t put very much time into answering your request. 
A few dozen people is a good minimum for your list.
When you use these five elements, your brainstorming e-mail ought to pro-
duce interesting responses. Follow up with a thank-you e-mail and a list of all 
the ideas offered (minus redundant ones). Ask your recipients to reply with 
any additional ideas that they may have had in the interim. The combination 
of the passage of time (which permits incubation to occur) and the list of 
other people’s ideas often stimulates another crop of interesting replies.
 
When you complete your project, e-mail your contributors one final time, 
summarizing what you ended up doing and thanking them again for their 
help with the brainstorming stage of the project. They’ll feel good about 
their participation and will be eager to help again.
Holding an e-mail contest for best idea
A contest can produce a flood of interesting e-mails. You can announce that 
you’re holding a contest for something like a new name or logo, new product 
concepts, or the best way to solve a problem. Recognition generally is the 
best prize: The winner gets the honor of seeing his idea turned into reality. 
Make sure that you provide a ceremony, a naming opportunity, or some such 
form of recognition for the winner. Also consider providing a tangible reward, 
such as a generous gift certificate, cash prize, or trip. Creating excitement 
about a contest is a surefire way to generate participation.
Competition is a controversial topic in creativity research. Some scholars 
find that competition reduces the creativity of suggestions and designs, but 
others have found it to be helpful because it produces persistent effort.
 
Your contest may produce a fabulous idea, or it may not, so be sure to use 
other forms of brainstorming. Using diverse approaches is the best way to 
ensure that you get diverse ideas.
Engaging in creative e-mail conversations
You can also engage in e-mail discussions of a problem or design. Think of 
these discussions as creative conversations. It takes at least two interested 
parties to hold a conversation, of course, so you’ll need to identify colleagues 
who are as interested as you are in solving your problem or improving your 
design. That selection process will limit your list — usually, to fewer than a 
dozen people.

151
 Chapter 8: Going Beyond Brainstorming
Send each of your highly interested colleagues an organized summary of your 
thinking so far, and identify the problems or puzzles you’re concerned about. 
Ask each person to reply with any suggestions or ideas that could move you 
ahead. Then reply to each response individually and thoughtfully, asking 
questions and probing to clarify or deepen your colleagues’ thoughts.
In essence, what you’re doing is conducting one-on-one brainstorming sessions 
via e-mail. This kind of creative conversation can go many rounds, leading to 
the exchange of dozens of e-mails if the topic is challenging.
Often, it’s easier to have a lengthy conversation with someone via e-mail 
than in person, because both of you can work your answers into your busy 
schedules instead of having to block out a day to meet and talk. Also, by 
engaging in multiple e-mail conversations, you can cross-fertilize ideas from 
one person to another. Bring an idea from one person into your conversation 
with another person to ask for her reactions or see whether it stimulates a 
fresh idea from her.
Crowdsourcing for New Ideas
Smart mobs are groups of people whom you’ve focused in a productive direction, 
often by asking them for their ideas or suggestions, and sometimes by 
asking them to vote on the best of a set of ideas, designs, or options. An 
old-fashioned way to create a smart mob is to hold an election — the 
premise of democracy. A more modern way is to use crowdsourcing, which 
is the planned use of viral-media platforms to solicit ideas and reactions. 
Crowdsourcing can tap into the latent intelligence of large groups of people, 
turning them into smart mobs to help you innovate.
You can tap into any professional network to get expert input, or you can go 
to the general public for a wider range of possibly naïve — but also possibly 
more creative — ideas and suggestions.
If you’re looking for a new brand name, consider posting a challenge to 
customers on social-networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace. 
(I assume that you already have pages for your business on these sites; if 
not, see my book Marketing For Dummies [Wiley] for tips on how to use these 
Web platforms.) You can offer a prize for the winning submission if you think 
that doing so will boost participation — which it often does. Also, send out a 
press release announcing the contest, and encourage both traditional reporters 
and bloggers to pass the word along. A contest to name a new product can 
create significant buzz and attract a lot of attention, potentially attracting 
thousands of participants to brainstorm with you.

152

Getting more help with your crowdsourcing
If you need help running the process of crowd-
sourcing ideas, look up the topic in a Web 
search engine, and you’ll come across several 
companies offering solutions, including the 
following:
 ✓ InnoCentive offers a Web-based idea market-
place (at www.innocentive.com) 
where Seekers post requests and 
Solvers (more than 100,000 of them) offer 
suggestions. If a suggestion is adopted by 
a Seeker — some company or charity in 
need of help — the Solver wins a financial 
reward. You can sign up in both Seeker and 
Solver categories and begin to experience 
open innovation firsthand.
 
 As you’ll see if you join, InnoCentive keeps 
the identities of both Seekers and Solvers 
confidential and handles all aspects of their 
contractual relationships (such as licensing 
of intellectual property; see Chapter 17). 
The protection of identities is an interesting 
aspect of InnoCentive’s approach to crowd-
sourcing that makes large companies more 
comfortable with the process by reducing 
their fears of being sued by the authors of 
unsuccessful inventions.
 ✓ Mom Invented (www.mominventors.
com) sources its products from thoughtful 
mothers who come up with labor-saving, 
clever devices and don’t know how to 
market them. The mother of a finicky eater, 
for example, designed a plastic cutter that 
trimmed the crust off a sandwich and sliced 
it in half with a single motion. Mom Invented 
now markets a line of Mini Bites Sandwich 
Cutters based on that idea and pays the 
inventor a 5 percent royalty. Everybody’s 
happy! The business model is based on the 
concept that thousands of mothers are out 
there thinking of good ideas and will send 
them to the firm that publicizes its interest 
in crowdsourcing. The concept seems to be 
working pretty well.
 
 Mom Invented has a unique set of prod-
ucts that I doubt anybody in a laboratory 
would have come up with. Take a look at 
the Web site to see what I mean. Then see 
whether you can tap into the creative ideas 
of a group of people whose experiences 
might make them good inventors for your 
product line!
 ✓ I’m particularly impressed by the offering 
from Cambrian House: Chaordix, a 
systematic method and platform that makes 
it easy to crowdsource on a large scale. 
See www.chaordix.com for details.
 ✓ Also visit IdeaConnection (www.idea 
connection.com) for another exam-
ple of an idea intermediary that connects 
people based on their ideas and idea needs.
Keep in mind that any vendor is going to charge 
you for help with your project, so you may want 
to see what you can do on your own first, going 
to expert vendors only after you’ve exhausted 
your own capabilities.
An old-fashioned suggestion system simply involves putting a box with a slot 
on top in a prominent part of the workplace and asking employees to drop 
their ideas into it. You can do the same thing today by using a picture of a 
suggestion box on your Web site. Have participants enter their ideas (for a 
new product, for example) on a form that looks like a scrap of paper. When 
a user clicks the Done button, his idea slides into the slot on the top of the 
box — virtually, of course. Once a week, empty the box, post the ideas, and 
announce a weekly winner. At the end of the month or season, select the 

153
 Chapter 8: Going Beyond Brainstorming
overall winner, and hold a press event to present the winner an Innovator of 
the Year award or something of that sort.
 
Even companies as large as Procter & Gamble (which has more scientists on 
staff than Harvard, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
combined) sometimes go outside for ideas. P&G queried thousands of sci-
entists around the world for their suggestions on how to control wrinkles in 
fabric, and it ended up signing contracts with several of those scientists to do 
product development based on their ideas.
Going Deep for Intuitive Insight
Intuition is variously defined as looking within for insight, tapping into 
tacit knowledge (what you don’t know that you know), using preconscious 
thought (ideas that pop into your head right away without apparent effort), 
or using the subconscious (thoughts and feelings you’re not aware of).
Intuition is probably central to the creative process, but researchers fail to 
agree on this point — or on virtually any other. What everyone does agree 
on is that creative thinking may draw on logic and analysis, but in the end 
involves a leap of understanding that’s very different from logical, step-by-
step problem-solving. Some people call this creative leap intuition; others call 
it creativity; and still others call it insight, imagination, instinct, or gut feeling.
When you talk about intuition, you get into some interesting related ideas, 
because some people feel that intuition taps into the spiritual or magical 
aspects of the world.
Do you believe in intuition? It’s an interesting question, because it gets you 
thinking about how you make decisions. Do you rely on logic, or are you com-
fortable with an answer that feels right but that you can’t explain logically?
If you’re among those who see something magical or spiritual in the operation 
of intuition, saying that you believe in relying on your intuition could imply 
that you accept a spiritual or religious influence or that you believe in fate. 
But for the topic of this discussion — innovating in business — it’s not 
necessary to sort out exactly how intuition works or whether any deeper 
force is at work behind it. You can just take advantage of the fact that 
intuitive approaches complement more-systematic ones and really do help 
produce creative insights.
At its worst, intuition is associated with New Age approaches involving the 
use of crystals, chants, and candles. At its best, it’s associated with expe-
rienced executives who size up a situation and instantly know what to do, 
or with experienced inventors or entrepreneurs who take one glance at 
something and instantly know how to make it a whole lot better — possibly 
making some serious money as they do so.

154
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Using naturalistic decision-making
Intuition is beginning to get some serious attention among researchers 
who study decision-making for the U.S. Army and Air Force, where formal, 
logical methods don’t seem to work as well in action as more naturalistic 
methods do. A field called naturalistic decision-making (NMD) has emerged, 
and researchers are increasingly appreciating an expert’s ability to size up a 
situation, draw a rapid (and apparently intuitive) conclusion, try a course of 
action, and adjust again quickly if the feedback isn’t what he expected.
So intuition definitely has a role in the workplace. How can you tap into your 
intuition in helpful ways as you try to make your mark as an innovator? For 
starters, use incubation (sleeping on a question of challenge overnight) to 
allow your own intuition to offer up possibilities. Also make a practice 
of asking experts for their ideas in casual, face-to-face conversations. 
Sometimes, an off-the-cuff remark by someone will reveal an intuitive insight 
that you can develop into a great new approach or option.
Going back to nature
Imagine someone who’s struggling to figure out the direction in which she 
wants to take her career. She might do well to take a weekend trip to the 
countryside, visit a waterfall, take a long walk, and generally get in touch 
with nature. What will happen to the problem she’s incubating as she takes 
this trip? It will probably begin to clarify into a new conviction about what’s 
really important to her and what she wants to do with her life. It’s very hard 
to come back from a trip to the countryside without some sort of clarity that 
you didn’t have before. Intuition bubbles up with ease when you get out of 
your normal high-pressure environment.
I know some innovators who bring nature into their workplace to help them 
think clearly and creatively. They use fountains or small water-bubblers, 
lush potted palm trees, Zen rock gardens, or bonsai trees to help them get in 
touch with their intuition.
Other people swear by a relaxing yoga program or a long swim in the nearest 
lap pool. I’ve tried the latter technique and (especially if I take a swim break 
at lunch) have been pleasantly surprised by the ideas that pop into my head.
Asking a wise elder
Do you know anyone who fits the description of a wise elder? Someone who’s 
seen and done a lot and now is good at listening to the troubles of younger 
people and asking penetrating questions to clarify their thoughts? Admittedly, 
many people are just as stupid in their old age as they were when they were 

155
 Chapter 8: Going Beyond Brainstorming
younger, but some people seem to actually grow wise. Take advantage of 
their wisdom! Ask them for guidance.
Using soothsaying techniques
If you aren’t skilled in soothsaying — the magical foretelling of events — don’t 
worry; there’s a book called Soothsaying For Dummies. That’s the good news. 
The bad news is that this book is imaginary, existing only in the electronic 
game World of Warcraft. I guess that the publisher of the For Dummies series 
doesn’t think that anyone in the real world will seriously need a reference to 
soothsaying, but in fact, some of the methods that fall under that heading can 
be useful ways of stimulating the intuition. In this section, I discuss two 
popular soothsaying methods: Tarot cards and the I Ching.
 
Runes, ancient bones, and any other soothsaying methods that you may want 
to try don’t so much tell you what to do as help you unlock or clarify your 
own insights. They’re tools for tapping into intuition. If you don’t know exactly 
how they work, so much the better, because the very definition of intuition 
involves a certain amount of mystery — intuitive thoughts being those that 
you find hard to explain or justify to others.
Tarot cards
Do you have a deck of Tarot cards on hand? If so, try drawing a card while 
holding your challenge in mind in the form of a question. Then interpret the 
card you draw and see whether it helps you understand your question.
You could ask the deck, “What should we do about the rising competition 
and loss of profit margins in our main product line?” Suppose that you draw 
the Fool — a card showing a jester walking near a cliff, with his belongings in 
a bag tied to a stick across his shoulder and a little dog trotting along beside 
him. Now you just have to interpret this card in a way that helps you answer 
your strategic question:
 
✓ As any guide to Tarot-card meanings will tell you, the Fool symbolizes 
the beginning of a journey, which suggests that you’d better be prepared 
for a major project. This character is happy-go-lucky and not very mindful 
of the nearby cliff that he might fall over. Clearly, your main product line 
is in danger!
 
✓ On the bright side, the Fool may have what he needs to solve any problem, 
packed in that sack he carries. He just has to stop and unpack it. With this 
thought in mind, you might take a careful look around your company for 
some good ideas for inventions that could revitalize your product line, 
making it more competitive and less subject to profit erosion.

156
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
I’m a little embarrassed to admit it here in print, but I sometimes do Tarot-card 
readings for clients. Why? Because they can provide real insight. I think that 
the cards tap into intuition by providing interesting and unusual images, 
challenging people to apply those images meaningfully to their own situations.
Tarot cards are used in some parts of the world for games, and I believe that 
in those places, the cards aren’t considered to be useful for soothsaying. 
(Too familiar, I suppose.) But if you don’t know the games that the cards are 
used for, they become mysterious and otherworldly, helping you tap into 
deep-rooted intuitions.
 
You can go online and find any number of Web sites where you can do a vir-
tual Tarot reading and get help interpreting the cards. I don’t know whether 
these sites are as accurate as a traditional Tarot deck — and maybe it doesn’t 
really matter — but they do save you the cost of the cards and an interpretive 
booklet. If you decide to buy your own deck, you may as well start with the 
Rider-Waite deck illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, which is considered to 
be the most authoritative of the many designs now on the market. You may 
also want to consult Tarot For Dummies, by Amber Jayanti (Wiley), to find out 
more about the practice.
I Ching
The I Ching, an ancient set of Chinese divination symbols, can also be useful 
for exploring a tough problem or working on a business strategy. If you want 
to try it, pick up a book, or find one of the many Web sites where you can 
“throw the bones” for free and see what you get. Use the I Ching as you would 
a Tarot deck, posing a tough question about how to solve a problem or what 
to do in the future, and see what ideas you get from the reading.
Being inventive
The lone inventor is a person of almost mythical proportions who, through a 
mix of hard work and brilliant insight, is able to see things others can’t. It may 
be that people with dozens of patents or scientific prizes to their names are 
brighter than most, but on average, inventors are rather ordinary in most 
ways; they simply behave differently from other people.
Thomas Edison, for example, didn’t choose to spend his time campaigning 
for votes; he preferred to tinker in the laboratory. He didn’t think of himself 
as being particularly intelligent. He focused on persistence and often told 
stories about the number of failures he experienced before coming up with 
a winning design. I think that his particular brilliance was in knowing that 
there ought to be some way to make an electric light bulb work. That much, 
his intuition assured him of. But what was the correct material for a filament 

157
 Chapter 8: Going Beyond Brainstorming
that wouldn’t burn out? Edison wasn’t sure, so he kept trying different 
materials until finally he hit on one that worked — which confirms his adage 
that genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration!
Being an inventor means following up on those hunches or intuitive thoughts 
with hard work. If you put in enough effort, you usually can figure out how to 
make something that you imagine into something that really works. Edison’s 
formula is probably correct, though: You can expect intuition to get you 1 
percent of the way, and you’ll have to sweat out the rest the hard way.

Turning Problems into 
Opportunities for Innovation
In This Chapter
▶ Approaching problems with an innovative spirit
▶ Using analytical problem-solving methods with an innovative twist
▶ Being a restless creative thinker looking for breakthrough solutions
O
ften, a problem — especially a problem of crisis proportions — does 
more to focus attention than any innovative idea can. Executive decision-
making comes to the fore when problems arise. We talk about having to make 
hard choices when a profit shortfall occurs, an employee’s performance 
is poor, or a new product or technology isn’t panning out as expected. A 
hard choice or tough decision really means that you have to choose among 
unpleasant options, and you don’t have an attractive choice in the menu of 
obvious possibilities.
Whenever you think that you have a tough choice to make, step back and 
see whether you can improve your options through creativity and persistent 
innovation. This chapter shows you how to turn problems into innovations 
by reframing them as opportunities to rethink things and push positive 
changes through in a hurry.
Seeing Problems with a Fresh Eye
A fresh eye means seeing things from different perspectives and gaining 
insight that other people lack. You desperately need a fresh eye to help you 
see the possibilities in a problem.

160
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Framing problems as creative 
opportunities
Reframing means changing the mental view. When you reframe a problem, 
you take a different perspective, often by changing your definition of the 
problem. Instead of seeing a cash-flow crisis as the result of overspending, 
for example, you might redefine the problem as a failure to manage cash flow 
tightly. Reframing a problem helps you see alternative solutions to it.
Tackling a survival exercise
Here’s a simple scenario to exercise your innovative problem-solving. 
Imagine that you’ve been shipwrecked on a deserted, sandy island with no 
natural source of water, and you must survive until you’re found — perhaps 
for a week or two. The island has some coconut trees. You find a few cases of 
water in old-fashioned glass bottles with non-twist-off lids, left behind years 
ago by someone who built a simple thatch-roofed shelter on the beach. A big 
old bucket is positioned at the lowest corner of the hut’s roof to catch rain-
water, but it’s bone dry now, and there’s not a cloud in the sky.
It’s hot, you’re thirsty, and you desperately need a drink, but you don’t have 
a bottle opener. How are you going to remove those rusty, stiff metal caps 
from those fragile glass bottles without breaking the bottles and spilling their 
contents? You decide to go for a walk along the beach to look for some 
natural tools.
When I challenge people in a workshop to solve this problem, they often ask 
me questions to help them think it through. Asking probing questions (doing 
your creative research) is always a good idea! So if you have questions, I can 
tell you that yes, the hut was made with local materials plus stuff from wrecked 
ships, such as rope and nails. Also, there are rocks, shells, and sticks of all 
sorts on the beach. But no, there’s no hidden toolbox on the island.
The first thing you need to do when you face a problem such as this one is 
decide to generate as many ideas as possible. That decision is a very impor-
tant one to make when you’re facing any problem, fictional or real. Students 
train in school to solve closed-ended problems, which have just one correct 
answer and usually one correct process for finding that answer. (If x = 2 and 
xy = 6, what does y equal? 3, right?) But most real-world problems are open-
ended, meaning that you have more than one possible way to approach and 
solve them. In business, the most important problems never have a formulaic 
solution, so if you stop with just one answer, you’ll miss other possibilities 
that might prove to be more advantageous.

161
 Chapter 9: Turning Problems into Opportunities for Innovation
Solving the survival problem
Okay, back to the problem of how to get a drink when you’re stuck on a 
sandy island without a bottle opener. How many ways did you think of? Here 
are some ideas that I came up with when I first thought about this problem, 
in the order in which I generated them:
 
✓ Break the top off a bottle with a rock, hoping that I can save at least half 
the water and not contaminate it with glass shards.
 
✓ Look for a shell that could work as a natural bottle opener.
 
✓ Find a strong clamshell and a sharp rock. Use the rock to shape a notch 
in the shell that would snag the underside of a bottle top and lever it up, 
the way a bottle opener would.
 
✓ Clean out the old bucket, break all the bottles in it, and let the glass 
settle to the bottom. Then ladle out the water at the top of the bucket, 
using a scoop made from a shell or a coconut.
 
✓ Split open some coconuts, and drink the water inside them instead of 
worrying about those old bottles.
Which answer is the correct one? Hmm. Beyond the obvious fact that my 
first idea was pretty bad, it’s not easy to say which is best. I do know that one 
of these ideas might be easier and more effective than any of the others in 
actual practice and that if I began to experiment with ideas such as these, I’d 
certainly find a way to keep myself hydrated until help arrived.
 
A classic creativity test asks people to think of as many uses as they can for a 
brick. Sounds dumb, I know, but try it sometime; it’s not as easy as you may 
think. Practiced innovators generate many more ideas than other people do. 
Can you break ten?
Postponing the decision to allow 
time for creative thought
Innovators tend to take longer to generate ideas and options than ordinary 
people do, because they see problems as opportunities to exercise their 
creativity. They eagerly jump at problems, even contrived exercises such as 
how to open bottles without an opener or what to do with a brick, because 
creative problem-solving improves with practice. If you think of yourself as 
creative and look for opportunities to test your creativity, you’ll continually 
improve your problem-solving skills.

162
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Using creativity prompts
 
Use external reminders of the value of creativity to boost creative output. 
You can use simple influences such as a favorite quote about creativity, an 
inspiring picture or melody, or a clever ad or product as props to stimulate 
your imagination.
Here’s an odd fact: When researchers administered the think-of-uses-for-a-
brick test to a group of subjects, the subjects who had just been exposed to 
the Apple, Inc., logo came up with more creative ideas than those who saw 
the IBM logo just before doing the exercise. Why? Apple’s brand identity 
reminds people to be creative, whereas the IBM brand evokes more logical, 
closed-ended problem-solving. A corporate logo is a small external influence, 
but even so, it proved to be enough to increase innovative problem-solving.
Approaching problems with optimism 
and hopefulness
It’s easy to be thrown off balance by a problem, especially if it’s unexpected. 
You can slip into a pessimistic viewpoint without even realizing it. When 
something bad happens, or a problem or challenge arises, be careful to avoid 
the pessimism path by following this advice:
 
✓ Don’t blame yourself unduly. You’re not stupid, and you aren’t doomed 
to fail at everything you try! Self-talk needs to be positive and encouraging. 
We’re our own worst enemies when it comes to the things we thought-
lessly say in the face or an error or problem. Take control of your 
self-talk!
 
✓ Blame the process, not people. One of the principles of quality improve-
ment is to blame the process, not the person — that is, you should look 
for problems in the way you do business (such as lax controls), rather 
than assume that someone else is at fault. When other people try to 
blame you for a problem, turn the situation around by asking them to 
help you think of ways to make the problem less likely to recur. Redirect 
the focus to the external causes, and talk about innovations that would 
prevent such problems or solve them effectively in the future.
 
✓ Look for openings created by the problem. A small problem opens the 
way for small changes, and a big problem or a crisis opens the way for 
major changes. Every problem creates momentum for change, and as an 
innovator, you can use that momentum to good effect by introducing new 
ideas, practices, or products that people might have ignored or resisted 
if a problem hadn’t come along to get their attention.

163
 Chapter 9: Turning Problems into Opportunities for Innovation
 
These three strategies help you overcome a reactive approach to problems, 
which I call circling the wagons: People get worried and try to fall back on 
traditional or conservative approaches instead of innovating. Usually, problems 
are at least partially due to traditional approaches, so trying to return to tradi-
tions in the face of a problem is a pretty useless form of denial. If you avoid 
playing blame games, seek understanding of the root causes of the problem, 
and look for openings to introduce change, you’ll innovate your way out of 
most problems with ease.
See Chapter 3 for more information on how to maintain and spread an 
optimistic attitude so as to stimulate creative thinking and maximize the 
chances of successful innovation.
Applying Analytical Problem-Solving
You’re taking a creative approach to problems, which is great! Don’t forget, 
however, that analytical approaches can be powerful complements to creative 
thinking. In fact, unless you happen to think of a brilliant solution right away, 
you should do your homework and analyze the problem before proposing an 
innovative response. The analytical process enriches your creative thinking 
by helping you understand the problem more fully.
Using Dewey’s problem-solving process
The modern, rigorous approach to problem-solving was best described by 
John Dewey (the man who also invented the Dewey Decimal System for inven-
torying library books) back in 1933, in a groundbreaking book called How We 
Think. Dewey provided a deceptively simple but powerful three-step process:
 
1. Define the problem.
 
2. Identify alternatives.
 
3. Select the best alternative.
Included in these three steps are all the key activities required to analyze a prob-
lem and come up with an innovative solution. If only more people would adopt 
Dewey’s method, there’d be a lot more progress and a lot fewer problems!
Defining problems with creative insight
When you start with a careful effort to define the problem, you almost always 
discover that the problem isn’t what it seemed to be at first or what other 
people told you it was. As a consultant, I’m very used to being called in to 
deal with a problem that proves to be poorly defined, as most business 

164
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
problems are. Problems get misdiagnosed in business for the simple reason 
that people notice symptoms of the underlying problem and leap to a diag-
nosis based on the initial symptoms. As in medical illnesses, business symp-
toms may have many root causes, and it takes a careful analysis to figure out 
what’s really going on.
Use the problem-definition stage to reframe the problem and gain insight into 
it. Often, the greatest creative insight comes during this first stage, in the 
form of a new and better way to define the problem.
Brainstorming real alternatives that expand the solution set
The second step in Dewey’s problem-solving method is thinking of a bunch of 
possible solutions, or a solution set. Usually, people make do with a fairly narrow 
solution set that lacks in both quantity and variety or originality of options.
Who or what is really to blame?
A new client recently told me, “Our managers 
need leadership training. They aren’t very good 
leaders. We need you to train them.” I asked, 
“Why do you have bad leaders? Didn’t you 
seek out managers with leadership credentials 
in your hiring?” The client replied, “Leadership 
was part of the job description, but they don’t 
seem to be doing it now.”
Persisting in my effort to define the client’s 
problem, I asked, “How do you know the 
managers are bad leaders? What’s the 
evidence?” “There’s a lot of complaints 
from employees,” my client explained. “And 
employee performance is poor.” I still didn’t 
understand the problem, so I asked, “Have 
you considered any other possible causes for 
employee complaints and poor performance?” 
He replied, “No. What else could it be?”
Then our conversation went into a fact-finding 
phase that helped clarify the actual problem. 
We ended up scrapping the idea of a leader-
ship workshop and instead looked into the ways 
that employees’ work was being structured and 
supervised. We found three urgent problems 
that needed fixing:
 ✓ A lack of time for managers to supervise 
employees and review their performance
 ✓ Inconsistencies between what employees 
were asked to do and what their perfor-
mance review system recognized and 
rewarded
 ✓ Uncertainty about the organization’s 
strategic direction and future stability
These three problems produced the symptom 
of dissatisfied employees who weren’t working 
as efficiently and effectively as they could. By 
asking probing questions, I discovered that the 
client had defined the problem incorrectly and 
was about to spend time and money on a quick 
fix that wouldn’t actually improve anything.
You should assume that any problem you 
encounter needs to be redefined, just as this 
one did.

 Chapter 9: Turning Problems into Opportunities for Innovation
 
Consider more than one basic approach, and develop at least three — 
preferably six or more — viable options. Your outcome is strongly affected 
by the size of your solution set.
Coming up with a healthy variety of possible solutions to a problem is fairly 
easy if you have experience with brainstorming, both alone and in groups. 
Use as many of the idea-generation techniques from Chapters 6, 7, and 8 as 
you can. Don’t stop brainstorming until you have several options that have 
significant merit. Refuse to be forced to choose among a few narrow options 
that don’t give you good outcomes, because there’s always another way.
Selecting a solution wisely and well
When you’re sure that you’ve defined the problem clearly and with insight, 
and you’re sure that you’ve generated more than the normal selection of 
options, you’re ready to choose the best solution. But which solution is best? 
In my experience, businesses very often look at fresh, new ideas but then 
revert to a traditional solution that fits old habits of thought and doesn’t 
necessitate change on the part of the people who’ll be asked to implement it.
 
In other words, the most popular solution to business problems is the most 
familiar of the various options. As you no doubt know, familiarity doesn’t 
guarantee quality when it comes to solving a problem. In fact, a less comfortable 
and more innovative solution usually would be far better than the familiar 
one, but uncertainty and fear hold people back from opting for the innovative 
approach. Therefore, my first and most important piece of advice to you as 
you consider possible solutions for any business problem is this: Watch out 
for the bias toward the familiar! This bias blinds many organizations and 
managers to better options.
Here are some better ways to choose an option from your list of possible 
solutions to a problem:
 
✓ Use comparative analysis. List the specific features of each choice 
(such as cost, benefits, and time frame) in a comparative table so that 
you can compare the options on an equal footing.
 
✓ Brainstorm lists of pros and cons for each option; then choose the one 
with the most going for it and the fewest problems.
 
✓ Build a future scenario — a fictional account of what your business 
will be like — for each of the possible solutions. Go into detail, asking 
for input from the people who know the most about the affected areas 
and operations. Then compare the future scenarios, and pick the most 
appealing one.

166
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
Notice that none of these methods of choosing a solution involves a popular 
vote. I’m skeptical about putting complex choices up for a vote. With a vote, 
you’re liable to fall prey to the appeal of the most familiar option rather than 
get the best one. I recommend voting only if you have a select group of 
experts who were all involved in the research and who thought about the 
options; otherwise, your efforts to be democratic may backfire. (The exception 
to this rule is a collective or staff-run organization. In a collective, the entire 
staff is involved in strategic decision-making and usually can tackle tough 
decisions in a sophisticated fashion.)
Performing a payoff analysis
Another way to select the preferred solution from your list of candidates is to 
perform a rigorous payoff analysis. This method — a staple of MBA programs — 
needs to be modified slightly to produce innovative results, but it can be 
quite helpful.
Suppose that you have a variety of options and don’t know which is best. 
That situation is common in business, after all. You may have a chance to 
invest in a new product or startup company, a choice of several strategies, 
or uncertainty about which of several possible cost cuts to make. Which is 
the best path?
A logical way to compare several choices is to calculate the payoffs (often 
defined as profits or returns on investment) for each option and then pick 
the one that pays the most. But what if you don’t really know how well each 
option will pay off? It’s hard to forecast the future with certainty. If you’re 
unsure, make low, medium, and high forecasts for each of your options. 
Ideally, that way you’re bracketing what will really happen, and you’ll be pre-
pared, no matter how well or poorly things go.
Creating a payoff table
Use a payoff table to compare options and possible outcomes. A typical table 
contains three options and three projected outcomes for each option. Some 
payoff tables include a column for probability next to each outcome to let 
you multiply the payoff by the probability before summing to calculate the 
overall average payout. Other tables are used to aim for the highest possible 
payoff, and still others are used to identify the option that involves the 
lowest possible loss.
Payoff tables can help you achieve your goal, whether it’s conservative or 
aggressive. It’s up to you to decide how to set up and read the tables based 
on your priorities and the quality of your information.

Figure 9-1 shows a payoff table for three levels of investment in a new ven-
ture: a 5 percent stake, a 25 percent stake, and a 50 percent stake. Which

If the venture in Figure 9-1 does well — meaning that it reaches the high 
profit projection of $300,000 — clearly, you’d like to have the highest possible 
stake in it. A 50 percent ownership investment costs $80,000 and, in the best-
case scenario, would produce a $150,000 profit, for a return on investment 
(ROI) of 188 percent. (ROI equals profit divided by investment.) But what if 
the worst case happens, and the venture produces a loss of $50,000? In that 
case, you’d lose $25,000 by investing $80,000 — the least desirable outcome. 
A more conservative approach might be better.
The payoff table in Figure 9-1 averages the three levels of payoff to calculate 
an overall return for each of the three levels of investment. The third option — 
investing $80,000 — gives the highest return on average, so it may be the best 
option in spite of the higher potential for loss.
It makes sense to average the possibilities if you think that they’re about 
equally probable. Otherwise — if, for example, you think that the first scenario 
is twice as likely as either of the others — you can refine your calculation by 
weighting the most probable option more heavily (such as by doubling it).
Boosting your payoff with creativity
The payoff table in Figure 9-1 is a classic business-school tool that can help 
you compare options and make more intelligent choices, which often helps 
you choose among options you’ve developed in a creative strategy session. 
It’s a good tool, but it’s not very innovative. What if you bump up payoff 
analysis by making it more creative? Here are some steps that can improve 
your payoff:

168
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
1. Brainstorm more options.
 
 There always seem to be just a few options in those payoff tables. Why? 
If you push ahead to come up with three more options (six total), you 
may hit on one that pays off at higher rates than any other. If you’re 
comparing options that have been laid out to you by other people, do 
some creative negotiating to see whether you can shake more and better 
options out of them to sweeten the deal.
 
2. Maximize the profits.
 
 A payoff table usually uses low, medium, and high projections in an 
effort to bracket the likely range of outcomes. That’s fine, but what 
if you could increase the payoff by innovating in the implementation 
stage? A really stellar creative effort could help you achieve a “very 
high” outcome. If you’re willing to put your effort and imagination into 
the implementation, it’s plausible to add a fourth column to your payoff 
table to project an exceeds-expectations or very-high outcome along 
with the low, medium, and high ones.
 
3. Minimize the losses.
 
 It’s possible to find creative ways to buffer yourself against losses if the 
worst-case scenario occurs. Spend some time brainstorming ways to 
reduce risk and minimize the negatives. Can you cut a creative deal that 
protects you from some of the possible risks, for example? Could an 
insurance company provide a policy?
 
4. Improve the quality of the projections.
 
 Better forecasts reduce the chance of guessing wrong, and a creative 
problem-solving effort aimed at making better forecasts can help narrow 
the range between your high and low guesses. Take some time to look 
for more and better examples to compare your situation to. Collect alter-
native forecasting tools and try them out. (Have you conducted a survey 
or a focus group, for example, or looked at trends in competitors’ sales?)
The creative problem-solver takes an innovative approach to business 
choices and isn’t limited by the initial set of options in his payoff table. Treat 
this table as a starting point for your analysis, planning, and imagining, and 
you’ll make better decisions than most people do!
Engaging Your Creative Dissatisfaction
Executive decision-making often takes the form of making informed choices. 
Forecasts and payoff tables help make your choice more informed, but they 
don’t improve your options — just help you choose among them. The innova-
tive executive doesn’t just want to choose among options; she also wants to 
improve them. Executive decision-making ought to involve innovation, not 
just selection. If you don’t see a great option, stop and think. Maybe you can 
improve the options before making your choice.

169
 Chapter 9: Turning Problems into Opportunities for Innovation
Recognizing the opportunity to be creative
How do you improve your options before deciding? Simple: Be dissatisfied. 
As I say repeatedly in this book, the first and most important step in innovation 
is deciding that you want and need to be creative. The next time the world 
dishes up a choice of options, reject the “Which one?” framing, and restate 
the problem as “Why be limited to these options?”
I use the term creative dissatisfaction to describe the way that innovative 
decision-makers work. It’s amazing how often you can — and will — find a 
better choice after you engage your creative dissatisfaction. Be assertive 
about demanding more time, thought, and information. Incubate the problem 
overnight. Ask others what they think. In short, engage all the creative-thinking 
tools you know about (see Chapters 6, 7, and 8), and turn the process of 
decision-making into an opportunity for creative thinking, not just for 
choosing among existing options.
Figure 9-2 shows what happened when a company that made industrial 
cutting equipment was examining options for three new product designs. 
After testing prototypes and showing them to core customers, the sales 
force projected low, medium, and high sales for the three designs.

Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Although the design with the highest sales projections was somewhat more 
costly to make than the other two, the executive team was eager to capture 
the most possible sales and was about to choose that option. Then one of 
the executives asked for some extra time to examine the three prototypes 
and think about the question. A week later, he presented a fourth design that 
combined good ideas from the other three but was made from off-the-shelf 
parts, which allowed for much lower production costs and pricing. The sales 
force was very excited and projected unit sales for this newest design at 
more than twice the level of the other three. Without a creative rethinking of 
the options, the company would have invested in a mediocre product that 
didn’t sell nearly as well as the one it finally selected.
Considering the opportunity 
costs of not innovating
 
Neat payoff spreadsheets, graphs, and tables make your choices look fixed 
and discourage you from doing more creative thinking. Watch out for this 
effect! No matter how neatly a decision is presented in a payoff table or other 
businesslike format, it’s still possible to come up with even better choices. 
The official term for failure to see and pursue a better option is opportunity 
cost. You don’t pay opportunity cost now; you pay it in the future, when some 
competitor comes out with a better design and your own sales fall, making 
you wish that you’d taken more time to improve your own design.
In Figure 9-2, the opportunity cost is represented by the distance between 
the highest solid line and the dashed one. Without innovation, the best-case 
scenario is significantly worse.
Applying intuition along with logic
How do the great inventors and entrepreneurs come up with their break-
through ideas? Not by constructing payoff tables and lists of pros and cons. 
Those and many other analytical activities — such as reading about the field 
and talking to experts — simply set the stage for a breakthrough. The real 
creative “aha!” moment comes from stewing about the problem for a long 
time until a fresh approach wells up from deep in your imagination.
 
Give yourself permission to imagine, dream, and create. Go for a long walk. 
Visit a museum. Play a musical instrument. Dance. Get out of your normal 
business context and see if a really great idea occurs to you. People who 
have great ideas are people who believe in great ideas and give themselves a 
chance to think deeply about the problems facing them. Give yourself permis-
sion to be a breakthrough thinker, and you’ll find that the number and origi-
nality of your ideas increase dramatically.

I
f you work in a Fortune 500 corporation, you probably have a research-
and-development (R&D) department made up of scientists, engineers, 
designers, and so forth, and your company probably develops the majority of 
its own innovations. But 90 percent of the world doesn’t have the resources 
to develop most of the innovations it needs, so it does what every good 
consumer does: goes shopping!
Whether you’re a retailer, wholesaler, or some other form of businessperson, 
you definitely need to broaden your view of innovation to include good ideas, 
inventions, and designs from beyond your own four walls. This chapter 
covers a variety of ways to tap into other people’s great ideas in legitimate 
ways that benefit both you and the inventor.
Exploring Your Industry’s Trade Shows
Trade shows are conventions for members of a particular industry. The show 
operators rent booth space to a wide range of wholesalers and suppliers. 
If you’re a retailer, you’ll find wholesalers at your industry’s trade show. 
A medical convention, on the other hand, features producers of medical 
services and products who are looking for medical practices to supply, and 
a wood-products convention cues up suppliers who want to sell to lumber-
yards, furniture manufacturers, and any other business that works with 
wood. There’s certainly a national trade show for your industry, and there 
may be regional ones too.

172
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Finding industry trade shows
How do you find a trade show for your industry? 
Here are some places to look on the Web:
 ✓ The Trade Show News Network: 
www.tsnn.com
 ✓ All-Biz.info’s international directory of 
trade shows: expo.all-biz.info/
Exhibition/lang/en/year/2010/ 
(or substitute the current year)
 ✓ Bvents: www.bvents.com
 ✓ EventsEye: www.eventseye.com
 
Finding an innovative new product can be as easy as going to a leading trade 
show and looking for something fresh and exciting that you can purchase 
wholesale or license the rights to.
If, for example, you’re involved in construction or building maintenance, you 
probably want to go to CONEXPO-CON/AGG, the biggest U.S. convention for 
the construction and agriculture industries (see www.conexpoconagg.com 
for the time and location of the next annual event). You might find new prac-
tices, products, suppliers, or business partners to work with. You might also 
find inspiration and go back to work with a fresh idea to try.
Assuming that you’re in the construction industry, you may also want to 
attend shows that offer different perspectives, such as the Greenbuild 
International Expo (see www.greenbuildexpo.org for the next event). 
This show was started in 2002 and has grown rapidly because it features 
innovative sustainable building designs and materials; green building design 
and management; intelligent, energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning; 
less-wasteful plumbing fixtures; and so much more. You might come back 
from the expo with an exciting plan to introduce a new line of green building 
products to your market area, such as superinsulated windows and window 
shades; energy-efficient lighting, air conditioning, and plumbing systems; and 
recycled building materials.
BuildingGreen (www.buildinggreen.com) is another source of innovative 
ideas. It conducted a Webinar on energy-efficient lighting that opened my 
eyes to the possibility of a regional business focusing specifically on lighting 
audits and plans for larger commercial, educational, and government buildings. 
A specialist who could go into a facility and identify ways to cut energy costs 
by 10–20 percent just by redesigning the lighting systems probably would 
have a nice little niche business, don’t you think?
Green building is a relatively new and fast-growing segment of the construction 
industry, and there’s certainly an opportunity for one to three companies in your 
area to become local or regional leaders in green building. Why not be a leader?

173
 Chapter 10: Going Shopping for Innovations
Crossing Boundaries for Good Ideas
You’re probably already aware that lots of fresh, new ideas exist beyond your 
doors. Some have been turned into successes already; others are waiting for 
some brave soul to develop them. Whatever the type and size of your business, 
you can be sure of finding more innovations outside it than within it, because 
most of the world lies outside your doors.
Your industry is a much bigger place than your individual workplace or busi-
ness. If you work in advertising, you tend to look to other advertisers for new 
ideas. If you work in manufacturing, other manufacturers are your bench-
marks, especially ones that make the same sorts of things your company does. 
If you work in government, you tend to look to other government offices or 
agencies for new ideas. As big as your industry or sector may be, however, 
it’s still far, far smaller than the entire universe of possible ideas. It’s important 
to look not only beyond your own company’s doors, but also beyond your 
industry’s doors, for fresh ideas and useful innovations. Many of the best 
ideas come from beyond the visible horizon of your industry’s boundaries.
 
Toymakers such as Mattel, Inc., for example, get the majority of their break-
through ideas from other industries, including electronics, plastics (injection 
molding and manufacturing), and entertainment. This fact seems obvious after 
you read it, right? A new Barbie doll, after all, has to be produced by using 
plastics technology from the wider world of industry, not from traditional toy-
making. Mattel isn’t expert in plastics and resins; it’s expert in marketing toys. 
Also, a Barbie product may draw on the consumer appeal of a character from 
a teen movie such as Bella from the Twilight series — a successful product for 
the Barbie line. Mattel relied on the innovative work of a book author and a 
movie producer to create the Bella and Edward characters and then licensed 
the right to make Barbie dolls of them. If a leading company like Mattel looks 
beyond its industry for help with its innovation agenda, you should too.
Visiting the wrong trade shows
The most exciting innovations often come from visits to trade shows that are 
far removed from your industry. A bookstore owner, for example, might do 
well to attend a consumer-electronics trade show, because books are having 
to share attention with electronic media. What ideas might you get as a book-
store manager when you look to the consumer-electronics industry for 
inspiration? Here are a few that I came up with:
 
✓ For each best-selling print book purchased in the store, offer an MP3 file 
of the audiobook for free.
 
✓ Link large-screen computer terminals to online book previews so that 
shoppers can look at books even if they aren’t in the store and then 
special-order them for pickup the following day.

174
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
✓ Offer titles in e-book format as an option to traditional bound books, and 
rent or lend an electronic book reader with each purchase of an e-book.
 
✓ Stock movies based on books alongside the books.
 
✓ Conduct frequent interactive online author chats with authors from 
around the world instead of bringing authors into the store only when 
they happen to be on a book tour (and perhaps install a giant surround-
sound video theater in the store for these video chats).
These initial ideas illustrate the point that a bookstore ought not to exist in 
isolation from the world of electronics. Instead, it could be cross-fertilizing to 
offer innovations in the way it does business and the way its customers 
interact with books and authors. A few days at a major electronics or 
entertainment-industry trade show would stimulate the imagination of any 
bookstore manager and produce dozens of these sorts of ideas.
Use the directory links in the earlier sidebar, “Finding industry trade shows,” 
to find major trade shows in complementary industries, and start to visit 
them. Make a practice of peeking into other fields and industries to see what 
innovations you can bring to yours.
Talking to outsiders
You may tend to focus on tangible things — actual physical inventions or new 
products in exciting styles and forms — when you go to trade shows or other-
wise shop around for something new. It’s also important, however, to keep 
your ear to the ground for exciting ideas that you can apply in your business.
How do you tap into fresh thinking from outside the boundaries of your 
business? One good way is to make a habit of talking to people who are 
outside your normal line of work. What’s new in brain surgery, landscaping, 
recreational boat sales, and library management? I have no idea, but I do 
know that new ideas crop up in each of those fields, and those ideas just 
might translate to my business. To find out, I could do the following:
 
✓ Talk to people who work in completely different fields from mine about 
the latest trends and challenges in their fields.
 
✓ Read trade magazines, professional journals, and blogs from other 
people’s fields and industries.
 
✓ Check the business news for reports of innovative behaviors in 
other fields.
 
The vast majority of people live and work beyond your neighborhood, 
profession, and industry. By focusing outward and asking questions, you 
open yourself to a broad flow of creative thinking.

175
 Chapter 10: Going Shopping for Innovations
Seeking out cross-training opportunities
A characteristic of successful entrepreneurs is that they often have experience 
in more than one field or profession. Take someone who started out selling 
insurance, then got a degree in nursing and worked in a medical center, and now 
runs an innovative consulting company specializing in helping companies find 
less-expensive healthcare plans for their employees. This person’s mixed work 
background made her especially well suited to being an innovator in that field.
Likewise, a finance person who gets a chance to work on a marketing team 
for a new financial product launch might be exposed to marketing and sales 
for the first time. Through that experience, he would gain insight into how 
consumers view their personal finances, which might lead him to propose a 
successful new line of investment products.
Whether you’re exploring a different area of your company or a different field 
or profession, look for opportunities to get some experience or training out-
side your profession.
Benchmarking Industry Innovators
It’s easy to feel daunted by the challenge of finding an industry leader and 
then trying to discover what that company does that makes it so successful. 
Usually, a top competitor’s winning strategies aren’t posted on a Web site for 
you to imitate. Fortunately, that’s not what I mean by benchmarking industry 
innovators. I’m simply talking about the little things you notice some com-
pany doing that you could do in your own business.
Millions of businesses operate around the world. Some of them are doing 
smart things that you might want to try yourself, so shop around for good 
ideas that you could adapt to your business. (See Chapter 17 for guidelines 
on what can be freely copied and what might have legal protection and 
should be left alone.)
Studying upstarts and startups
The dynamic new businesses in any industry are where much of the innovation 
takes place. Usually, these businesses are ignored for a few years or more, 
until some of them gain enough market share to scare the established firms 
and command attention. You can and should study upstarts before they 
become widely known, however — and even before they become 
successful, because some of the best innovations come from these fresh, 
new businesses. These companies represent the future of your industry. 
What does the future look like?

176
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Highlighting bestsellers and new products
Any wholesale supply business has to do what 
science-classroom supplier Sargent-Welch 
does: offer a broad range of staples. It’s impor-
tant to keep bestsellers in your catalog and on 
your Web site along with dozens to hundreds 
of specialty items that a customer might need 
to order. If you don’t have the depth of inven-
tory to meet customers’ needs, they’ll take their 
searches — and their orders — elsewhere.
Sargent-Welch lists more than 1,000 products 
on its Web site (sargentwelch.com), but 
that’s not what strikes me as being innovative. 
What impresses me is how clearly the site flags 
new products. A navigation bar on the left side 
of the home page includes New Products as 
a clickable option, and when you select it, the 
bar expands to show how many new products 
are available in a dozen specific areas. (When 
I last checked the site, it was offering 2 new 
microscopes, 27 new earth-sciences products, 
and 92 new physics products.) A science 
teacher wondering what to do with next year’s 
physics class will be unable to resist browsing 
those new products for fresh teaching ideas 
and interesting new labs to offer. I’m inspired 
to check my own businesses’ Web sites to see 
whether they do as good a job of pointing regular 
customers toward new products that they might 
find interesting.
 
Here are a couple of examples that illustrate the sort of businesses you should 
watch for:
 
✓ If you’re in the news business, you may have noticed that a self-styled 
virtual publisher called Crowd Fusion, Inc., (www.crowdfusion.com) 
raised several million in funding in 2009 — a year marked by losses 
among conventional newspaper and magazine publishers and the 
failures of some of them. Crowd Fusion uses a better (read: much 
cheaper) way to publish news about a topic: It integrates and organizes 
content from the Web so that it seems like you’re reading dozens of well-
researched articles by professional journalists. Check out, for example, 
Super Eco (www.supereco.com), a virtual magazine rich with articles 
about everything green. It pops to life on the Web page because of the 
clever software provided by Crowd Fusion, and no doubt it draws 
readers from more traditional publications on the same topic.
 
 Can you pick up something from Crowd Fusion? Here’s a thought that 
the example suggests: You shouldn’t hire journalists to research and 
write articles in the traditional way; so much content is posted on the 
Web every day that you can build almost any news-oriented product 
from what’s already there (but a trained journalist is still going to do 
a better job of aggregating and editing material than someone without 
experience). You can compile source material manually if your ambitions 
are modest — a company newsletter or informative blog, for example. 
Or you could license Crowd Fusion–type software and use it to build 
fancy info-communities of your own.

177
 Chapter 10: Going Shopping for Innovations
 
✓ Another startup that catches my eye is Redux (redux.com), whose big 
idea is to provide friendsourced entertainment — in other words, you get 
to view video clips that your friends have recommended or are watching. 
Other content is cued up based on what your friends like. The company 
explains its unique benefit as offering videos, photos, music, and Web 
sites recommended by people who love the same stuff that you do. It’s 
akin to other social-media Web sites but is more content-rich. I don’t 
know whether this particular Web site will be the next big thing, but 
its idea may be. The content is unique for each viewer and is compiled 
based on that viewer’s particular community of friends and their shared 
interests.
Could a business Web site morph into something unique for each visitor? 
Perhaps a supplier of cleaning products could have a Web site that looks one 
way to a homeowner, another way to a purchasing manager for a big corpo-
ration, and yet another way to a manager of custodial services for a school. 
Why not?
Interviewing innovative job candidates
You’ll find that most people have interesting ideas if you just think to ask 
them for their opinions! Every job interview should include this question: 
“Can you think of something we could be doing better or smarter than we 
are?” In other words, while a candidate is trying to impress you and convince 
you that he’s a great job candidate, he could suggest some ways that you 
could improve your business. If you ask, you’ll certainly get some interesting 
answers. Further, if you really like an idea, you just might decide to hire the 
candidate who offered it — and assign him the task of helping to implement 
his suggestion.
Another tip for hiring is to look for evidence of innovative contributions in 
past jobs. Résumés usually don’t feature creativity, because candidates make 
the (false) assumption that future employers are conservative and more 
interested in credentials than imagination. But really, why hire someone who 
doesn’t have any ideas to contribute?
 
The easiest way for a company to become an innovative industry leader is to 
staff it with innovative people. Make sure that every new hire has a proven his-
tory of contributing valuable ideas and also has demonstrated an ability to think 
on his or her feet during the interview process. Describe a current problem or 
challenge during the interview, and ask for suggestions. You’ll soon know 
whether you’re talking to an original thinker and good problem-solver.
 
Please don’t hire a résumé. No matter how good it looks, the person who can’t 
answer your tough questions is the one who’ll be coming to work for you — 
not her résumé.

Seeing what businesses are boasting about
Businesses that introduce a new product, reorganize to improve efficiencies, 
or open a new line of business tend to publicize what they’ve done. Browse 
business press releases to find out what innovations companies are boasting 
about, and see whether any of their accomplishments give you good ideas 
that you could implement in your own workplace. Here are some good places 
to check for interesting announcements:
 
✓ ThomasNet News posts dozens of interesting innovations from all indus-
tries (agriculture, construction, mining, electronics, manufacturing, and 
so on). See the New Product News feature at news.thomasnet.com.
 
✓ PR Newswire, which most U.S. businesses use, posts dozens of new 
releases every day. Go to www.prnewswire.com and select Browse 
News Releases or drill down into news specific to a category that inter-
ests you, such as Consumer Products and Retail or the Environment.
 
✓ PRZOOM offers free distribution of business press releases, making it a 
favorite for businesses around the world. Visit www.przoom.com to see 
whether the stories spark your imagination.
 
✓ Business Wire is another widely used platform for press releases. 
Although I find that it tends to have fewer stories about interesting 
innovations and more stories about economic trends and executive 
promotions, you might find the seed of a good idea in one of its daily 
press releases. Visit www.businesswire.com for inspiration.
 
You can find something interesting in the latest crop of business announce-
ments; I’m sure of it. The trick is to skim this vast body of announcements 
looking for ones that trigger your innovative imagination.
Taking a positive approach 
to evaluating possibilities
As you look at innovative ideas from a wide range of sources, bear in mind that 
it takes open-minded imagination to find a way to apply them in your business. 
Ideas don’t come ready-made for implementation; they’re just starting points for 
your innovative thinking. Therefore, don’t approach them with a critical eye.
Look at the pros and cons of every idea. Notice that the phrase pros and cons 
starts with pros — the benefits or good points of an idea — and considers the 
cons — the negatives — after noting the positives. You could quickly dismiss 
every idea that you come across, because all ideas have some issues or 
barriers that you’d need to overcome to make them work in your business. 
But if the benefits are substantial, it may be worth the time and trouble to 
adapt an idea to your own purposes.

179
 Chapter 10: Going Shopping for Innovations
Checking for alignment with 
your competencies
I can imagine a lot of great new business opportunities, because I do so much 
brainstorming with clients that it’s just second nature to come up with ideas 
for innovations. I pass right by most of those ideas, however, because my 
own business portfolio doesn’t include the right competencies. I don’t do any 
large-scale manufacturing, for example, so a manufactured product probably 
isn’t a good match for my business. Nor do I do anything involving electronics. 
Also, although my companies are competent in distribution and sales, they 
don’t sell directly to consumers — only business to business. If I get an idea 
for a cool, new consumer product that somebody should manufacture and 
sell, I pass the idea on to an appropriate client. I know my limitations.
 
Even with a rich imagination and a copy of Business Innovation For Dummies, 
you’ll find that plenty of ideas aren’t a good fit for your business. As you 
evaluate ideas, check them for viability — meaning that the pros outweigh 
the cons, so the ideas ought to be successful — and then do a second level of 
checking to see whether the idea matches your capabilities. If not, keep looking. 
Ideas are free. You can throw away lots of them and keep looking until you 
find one that’s a good fit.
Sourcing from Innovative Suppliers
Your business, like all others, sources a lot of materials, products, and services 
from other businesses. I estimate that about 90 percent of suppliers are 
relatively conservative, but 10 percent of them are quite innovative. A very 
simple way to be innovative yourself is to source from innovative suppliers. 
Let them do the hard work of developing a new approach and offering it to 
you as a turnkey innovation.
Evaluating suppliers based on their 
creative momentum
Companies usually select suppliers based on a mix of service and pricing. 
That’s fine in the here and now, but success requires forward thinking. Add 
a third criterion — innovativeness — to the mix, and you’ll select suppliers 
who can help you succeed both now and in the future.

180
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
It’s easy to compare suppliers’ prices, and service quality also is fairly easy 
to compare when you have a track record to go on. How do you know, 
however, which suppliers are innovating and which ones aren’t? Here are 
a few key indicators to look for in a supplier:
 
✓ The overall look and feel of the business (including the people, printed 
materials, facilities, and Web sites) are modern and energetic. The 
business doesn’t look old-fashioned or set in its ways.
 
✓ The people talk about new products and services frequently and make a 
point of sharing their latest thinking. They don’t rest on the laurels of a 
static product line and past success.
 
✓ The business embraces new technologies in its own processes and 
operations. You find ample evidence of enthusiasm for progress and 
willingness to change.
 
✓ The people ask questions about your business; they seem to be eager to 
learn and to share their own learning. Avoid arm’s-length suppliers who 
are interested only in writing your order.
Suppliers who meet all of the above criteria are innovative, and they’re likely 
to help you stay on the leading edge of your own industry.
Shopping for a bright future
An entrepreneur in Los Angeles decided 
that there was a need for a really innovative, 
fashion-forward home-lighting store offering 
products that weren’t sold at Home Depot or any 
of the large lighting suppliers. Clearly, though, 
she wasn’t going to manufacture all her own 
products to start with. Her business plan called 
for opening a boutique based entirely on prod-
ucts purchased at wholesale and then gradually 
building relationships with the best suppliers 
she could find; they would begin to make 
custom designs on an exclusive basis as she 
added more stores in other locations over a 
several-year period.
To find her initial product line, she visited the 
International Contemporary Furniture Fair 
in New York’s Jacob K. Javits Convention 
Center. She also traveled to Asia to attend the 
Hong Kong Houseware Fair and to Germany to 
attend the Heim+Handwerk convention, which 
features advances in home construction and 
interior furnishing, with an emphasis on sustain-
ability as well as arts and crafts. She assembled 
a list of several dozen unique vendors whose 
designs had never appeared in Los Angeles.
Her store opened a year later to positive 
reviews and was quickly regarded as being the 
leading innovator in home lighting, even though 
she had yet to design a single lamp herself.

181
 Chapter 10: Going Shopping for Innovations
Asking your suppliers for free consulting
When you’ve shifted over to suppliers that are innovative, price-competitive, 
and good at servicing your orders, you’re ready to invite them to help you 
improve your business. This strategy is very powerful, and I don’t need much 
room in this book to describe how to apply it. Basically, you want to get into 
constructive discussions with your suppliers by asking them what they think 
you could be doing to improve your business.
The suggestions that suppliers come up with often involve using their prod-
ucts or services, of course, so you need to keep in mind their natural bias 
to make a sale. Often, however, their ideas have merit, and there’s nothing 
wrong with, say, switching to a different product if that switch benefits your 
business and your customers. Be open to ideas and proposals from innova-
tive suppliers, and you’ll have a virtual R&D department that’s eager to help 
you innovate.
Bringing your suppliers together 
to brainstorm
It’s rare, but remarkably effective, to bring multiple suppliers together and 
pick their brains for improvements and innovations. The reason it’s good to 
get two or more of your suppliers in your office at the same time is that they 
may come up with a really clever way to combine their ideas, products, or 
services. Bringing them together forces them to think outside their normal 
boxes and helps you form creative new approaches to sourcing.
Call in your suppliers at least once a year to brainstorm ways to improve your 
business. Gathering half a dozen suppliers, each from a different industry, will 
ensure a rich mix of perspectives and possible cross-fertilization of ideas.
Going to the Experts for Help
In many industries and professions, associations or other organizations publish 
standards and research on best practices. These organizations can be sources 
of innovations that help improve the quality of your services or product.
 
The Sunnyside Child Care Center at Smith, located in Northampton, 
Massachusetts, is a small organization without a major budget for research 
and development. It taps into the expertise of the National Association for the 
Education of Young Children by maintaining accreditation with that organiza-
tion, which means that its staff and practices are subject to expert review and 

182
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
especially high standards of practice. It also purchases an advanced report-
writing system from Pearson Education, Inc., which provides rich feedback 
about each child’s development to the teachers and parents. Parents feel 
confident that their children are getting a great start because of the advanced 
methods and tools used. Not all day-care centers have the resources to do 
their own research on early childhood development, of course, but if a center 
shops around for expertise and brings in leading practices, it can gain a 
reputation for being innovative and expert — and so can yours!
 
In any field or profession, fewer than 10 percent of people stay up-to-date with 
leading-edge thinking and practices. By staying in touch with your industry’s 
experts, you can be on the leading edge with those who implement new 
practices and approaches. Make sure that you belong to — and participate 
in — your industry’s trade associations and your profession’s membership 
societies. Attend workshops led by innovators, read experts’ blogs, and make 
a point of knowing what the new ideas and practices are.

Coming Up with Creative 
Combinations
In This Chapter
▶ Studying successful combinations for inspiration
▶ Finding fresh combinations of your own that produce winning innovations
▶ Mixing and matching problems and solutions to see what you can invent
▶ Trying creative ways to brainstorm unimagined combinations
▶ Combining a conventional need with unconventional information or ideas
▶ Delivering the benefits of a product in some new, unexpected form
T
his chapter shares a secret of successful innovators: You’re far more 
likely to invent a winning design by combining two existing ideas or 
designs than by creating something entirely new. More likely, you will succeed 
by doing what most innovators do: combining earlier ideas, processes, or 
products into something that has new utility and that can be packaged and 
sold as your own.
In this chapter, I show you how to create innovative new products by using 
your existing products as building blocks. I also cover ways of building new 
designs and strategies out of fresh pairings of existing designs and ideas. 
Whether you’re creating a new ad campaign, a new product design, or a whole 
new business, there’s usually a way to shortcut the innovation process by 
standing on the shoulders of the many innovators who’ve come before you.
Finding Inspiration in Successful 
Creative Combinations
Genetic recombination is the root of biological creativity, producing offspring 
with a mix of genes from their two parents. The power of combination is the 
key to individuality in nature and to innovation in business. For every 

184
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
completely new-to-the-world invention, there are a hundred successful 
innovations that combine existing ideas or things in fresh and useful ways.
 
A map plus satellite triangulation equals the Global Positioning System (GPS), 
invented in 1993 by the U.S. Department of Defense and now finding everyday 
use in boats and cars for navigation. Fast-forward 25 years for the combination 
of GPS plus camera, which produced the Eye-Fi Geo card. This card records 
the location in which each digital photo is taken, so that years later, when 
you’ve forgotten where you took that snapshot, the GPS coordinates will be 
available. (The data storage card is intended to be integrated into cameras, 
because Eye-Fi doesn’t make cameras itself.)
Combine GPS with hook-and-eye tape to get a motion detector for the elderly 
who are living alone. Strapped to an arm or leg, the device sends an alert 
to a remote relative when it detects prolonged lack of motion. ARKNAV 
International, Inc., introduced a product based on this combo concept. 
Clever, huh?
Now combine a GPS with a simple digital recording device to get a back-
tracker — a GPS unit that you can consult when you realize that you’re lost 
so you can retrace your steps. The combo is being marketed to hikers and 
backpackers by Qstarz under the brand name GPS BackTrack. (Can someone 
adapt it to help me find my car when I lose it in mall and airport parking lots? 
I bet! But where did I put my backtracker . . . ?)
All these combinations involve the idea of orientation or navigation combined 
with something else to give it special value. Can you invent something new 
and useful that involves a GPS device and [fill in the blank by brainstorming 
20 useful objects]?
 
Here are some more combinations that created helpful innovations:
 
✓ Emergency whistle + mini-compass = Essential gear for hikers and boaters 
to clip to their zippers or life-jacket rings. (Update it with a mini-GPS?)
 
✓ Unbreakable water bottle + carabineer (D-ring) clip attached to screw-on 
lid = Clip-on water bottle for students and hikers to attach to a backpack.
 
✓ Cellphone + music player, Web browser, and other applications = 
Great new do-everything phones.
 
✓ Yogurt + fruit + keep-dry packet of granola = Update of a great combo 
concept that’s gaining market share now.
 
✓ Photo + video = A combination of recording options that’s becoming 
standard on digital cameras. (Finally, still and moving pictures in a 
single camera!)
 
✓ TV + Internet + telephone = A combination of services now offered by 
many cable companies to take advantage of their high-capacity lines.

185
 Chapter 11: Coming Up with Creative Combinations
 
✓ Clothing + appliances + groceries = A combination of product categories 
that everybody else thought didn’t belong in the same store until Wal-
Mart did it.
 
✓ Book + computer = The Amazon Kindle and other book readers that display 
the text on lit screens rather than on pages. Goodbye, printing presses?
 
✓ Couch + bed = The classic sleeper-sofa and the fold-out futon, both of 
which were major furniture innovations in their day.
 
✓ Footstool + wireless speakers = A simple furniture item that has a wire-
less speaker built into it to make surround sound easy in any room.
 
✓ Whitener + mouthwash = Listerine’s Whitening Rinse product, which is 
catching on by taking market share from toothpaste-whitener combos.
 
✓ Computer keys + touch-sensitive screen = A touch-sensitive screen with 
dimples so that you can feel the keys in the dark.
These examples aren’t just for fun. I put them in this chapter because reviewing 
dozens of combination innovations is the best way to power up your imagina-
tion and invent good combinations of your own. Pharmaceutical companies 
do the same thing. Have you noticed that commonly used combinations of 
drugs are now being melded into one product to simplify life for patients 
(and increase profits for the drug companies)?
Finding Innovative Combinations 
of Your Own
It’s inspiring to realize how many successful innovations are really combi-
nations of two (or sometimes three) existing designs. Now that you know 
the best-kept secret of innovation, you’re ready to try your hand at almost-
instant inventing by finding fresh combinations that you can call your own. 
I’ve given a lot of thought to how to come up with good combinations, and 
this section lays out several methods that you can try.
Revisiting classic combinations 
for quick wins
When you look at historically successful combinations, keep in mind that 
they’re good for more than just inspiration; a surprisingly large number of 
new products actually revisit old creative combinations. Some combinations 
are just so natural that they can support product after product. How many 
ways are there to combine chocolate and nuts, for example? I guarantee 
that a candy company will introduce a new product based on this perennial 

186
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
combination sometime in the next year. The product might be almond-butter 
cups rather than peanut-butter cups, so it will seem exciting and new, but 
really, it’s just a minor change to an old combination.
 
Take a close look at classic combinations to see whether you can find a way to 
revise them and make them your own. It’s a fair bet that a combination others 
have succeeded with more than once in the past will support at least one 
more success in the future!
Brainstorming combinations with 
one of your core products
Brainstorming is a simple exercise that can produce profitable new lines of 
business, but for reasons that escape me, most businesses never do it. All 
you have to do is set one of your own products in the middle of your 
conference table, assemble a creative group (see Chapter 6) to sit around the 
table, and ask the group to come up with 50 ideas for combinations with that 
product. The goal of 50 ideas is important because it gets the group to use a 
freewheeling, rapid-fire approach in a hurry.
If, after 23 ideas or so, the group hits on a brilliant one and wants to switch 
over to developing it, okay. If not, keep pushing ahead to 50 ideas; then pull 
the best 20 and brainstorm ways of refining or bettering them until you finally 
come up with the winner that you want to develop and introduce.
Suppose that your company sells kitchenware, and one of its perennially 
popular products is a line of bright-colored enamel colanders. A colander is 
simply a bowl with holes in it to let water drain out, used to wash fruit and 
vegetables or to strain cooking water off pasta. What could you possibly 
combine with a colander to create a fresh innovation? Hmm. I have no idea 
either. It’s a tough example, actually. But I’ve brainstormed ten ideas to get 
you started:
 
✓ Combine the product with fresh grapes, peaches, and other delicate 
fruits to make a gift colander that replaces the conventional gift basket 
and provides a more useful leftover product than a basket.
 
✓ Redesign the product as a decorative ball or cylinder that holds a 
candle. Its light would shine out of dozens of holes in the attractive red, 
blue, black, or white enamel of the Candle Colander.
 
✓ Offer miniature colanders full of chocolates. (Why? I’m not sure, but the 
idea seems like fun. Maybe the chocolates could be shaped and flavored 
like fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.)
 
✓ Make a disposable paper colander.
 
✓ Make a cloth colander that’s a joke hat.

187
 Chapter 11: Coming Up with Creative Combinations
 
✓ Make miniature colanders that screw onto bases and serve as salt and 
pepper shakers.
 
✓ Make miniature colanders that screw together to form elegant, enameled 
metal tea and spice infuser balls.
 
✓ Combine a teapot with a colander that sits inside the lid to form an 
infuser that’s more elegant than the normal wire-mesh version.
 
✓ Combine the colander with a flat sheet-metal pan to create a Colander Pan. 
(What’s it for? That’s a good question for a second round of brainstorming. 
Maybe it sits inside a regular pan to create a better roasting pan.)
 
✓ Make light covers and shades from colander-style metal with holes in it.
Okay, those ten ideas are a start, but if I were trying to come up with 
combination innovations for that kitchenware company, I’d push the group 
to generate four more sets of ten ideas before assessing what we had. Often, 
the third or fourth set produces the biggest winner — not the first set.
Maybe a colander combined with a saucepan could form a new and better 
way to steam vegetables in the same colander you used to wash them. Why 
not add a third item to the combo: a plastic storage container that also fits 
the colander so that the vegetables never have to leave their colander? You’d 
have the new Hiam Vegetable System, soon to be sold in stores everywhere!
The point is, a virtually limitless number of combinations is out there, and all 
you have to do is keep thinking of ideas until you hit on the one that fits your 
business and turns customers on. What if you don’t? That’s okay, because 
you can come up with inspired combinations in other ways.
Recombining fundamental innovations
There are innovations, and then there are the great innovations that all 
others build on. Take the wheel. It took 3,000 years for humanity to perfect 
the hub-and-spoke wheel. Now you can take this design and combine it with 
countless other things to make . . . oh, perhaps a million other products. So 
many inventions use the wheel in one way or another, odds are that you can 
come up with yet another one.
Another fundamental innovation is the ball. Yes, the round sphere. It took a 
long time for people to recognize that the world is round. Before that, no one 
was very interested in making or using ball-shaped objects. Since then, how-
ever, people have come up with lots of uses for spheres: ball bearings, ball 
joints, baseballs, gumballs, and ballpoint pens, to name a few.

188

Figure 11-1 shows a clever invention by James Dyson, the famous British inven-
tor who created the Ballbarrow — a combination of a large rotating ball under-
neath a plastic wheelbarrow. The advantage is that the big ball doesn’t get 
stuck in the mud like a traditional wheel does. Dyson went on to combine a ball 
with a vacuum cleaner, producing the breakthrough design shown in the figure.
Hinges, levers, ramps, steps, ratchets, and gears are all examples of funda-
mental innovations that find their way, through combination, into thousands 
of other inventions every year. The container is another fundamental inven-
tion, re-created in different materials and forms millions of times, depending 
on the application. Can you build on one of these fundamental innovations to 
create something more specific that meets a modern-day need? Or how about 
starting with a more recent fundamental innovation, such as the computer 
chip, electric motor, radio, or robot?

 Chapter 11: Coming Up with Creative Combinations
It’s snowing pretty hard outside my office window as I write this chapter, 
which makes me want to combine a radio (for remote control), a computer 
chip (for intelligent navigation), a motor and wheels (for mobility), and a 
small-scale snowplow or blower to make myself a SnowBot. The machine 
would be busy clearing my front walk and driveway while I write, so I wouldn’t 
have to wait for the expensive crew with snowplows and snowblowers to 
show up hours after the end of the storm, when a foot or more of snow has 
accumulated and clearing it is a big problem.
The SnowBot would be an engineering challenge but certainly not an impos-
sible one, because fundamental innovations would provide building blocks 
for the project. NASA sends rovers around the surface of Mars, so surely it’s 
not hard to make a little rover that clears snow. If you’re good at this kind of 
thing, please get working on it. I’ll buy one!
Combining Problems with Solutions
The idea behind this method is to start with a problem (as in Chapter 9) and 
then look for solutions to other problems that might be adaptable to your 
problem. In other words, use combinatorial creativity as a shortcut to inspi-
ration as you develop alternatives.
Finding problems similar to your own
Often, problems have similarities. Your problem may have something in 
common with another one that’s already been solved. The security camera, 
for example, is a solution to the need for continuous monitoring of high-
security areas, such as the cash registers of all-night convenience stores. 
You may have a different security need, but the basic concept of using a 
camera to meet that need could still apply.
When I heard on the news a few nights ago that nine houses had been burned 
down in my area, it got me thinking that fire alarms and extinguishers could 
be combined with other readily available products — such as lights, 
prerecorded voice instructions, and digital video recorders — to improve 
home security. Many commonplace items and designs can be used in specific 
ways to solve specific problems, and the result is often a valuable innovation. 
Sometimes, even though you’re working with readily available components, 
the combination of them is nonobvious and actually qualifies for patent 
protection. (Turn to Chapter 17 for advice on when and how to protect your 
intellectual property.)
Here are some ideas that combine existing solutions with the new problem 
of how to be prepared for a fast-moving nighttime house fire caused by a fire 
bomb or Molotov cocktail:

190
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
 
✓ More people would escape nighttime fires if each door had an emer-
gency light — perhaps a wireless LED light mounted above the door that 
would go off only when the heat, smoke, or carbon-monoxide detectors 
were activated.
 
✓ If the house alarms were integrated into a central system, as many are 
these days, there could also be a speaker at each exit door and window, 
and one of them could be activated to indicate the safest evacuation 
route based on where the heat and smoke were detected in the house.
 
✓ If a fire is localized and has not progressed beyond control yet, a quick 
application of a fire extinguisher may control it and save the house — 
but finding your fire extinguisher in the dark is often a challenge. Why 
don’t fire extinguishers have wireless emergency lights on them, too?
 
✓ There’s no reason not to integrate a fire extinguisher into a central alarm 
system. A simple on-off switch in the cradle would indicate whether the 
extinguisher was in place or had been removed for service or use.
 
✓ A further combination occurred to me when I thought about the modus 
operandi of the arsonist (or arsonists) whose activities made my local 
news: tossing a flaming bottle of gas onto a porch or through a window 
and then running away. Nobody’s seen the arsonist(s), because the fires 
strike in quiet residential neighborhoods at night. It would be handy 
to have a simple digital video recorder mounted in an inconspicuous 
weatherproof box on a pole or otherwise placed out of reach, with the 
camera aimed at the front of the house. This device could be tied to the 
house’s heat and smoke alarms, and it could be set to transmit its past 
hour of memory to a central station as soon as an alarm is tripped so as 
to provide insight into the origins of the fire.
 
 The digital camera mounted outside the house could also stream a live 
image for the alarm-station operator to view, which would help the 
operator decide whether the alarm was real and make any call to the 
fire department more prompt and informed.
These ideas aren’t difficult to imagine, really; I don’t think that any of them 
would win an inventor’s award. They flowed quite naturally, however, from 
a focus on a specific problem.
Looking for problem themes
What makes your problem like others that may already have good solutions? 
The answer is problem themes — general, abstract statements of what’s 
wrong. After you generalize your problem, look around for other problems 
that fit the general category. Maybe one of their solutions can be adapted to 
your needs. I have a problem with squirrels getting into my office and studio, 
for example. They climb onto the roof, gnaw holes in the trim, and slip into 
the interior of the walls, from whence they sneak around the building and 
cause no end of trouble.

191
 Chapter 11: Coming Up with Creative Combinations
I called an expert, who examined the building and announced that because 
the crawl spaces were inaccessible (to him — obviously, not to the squir-
rels!), he’d have to trap the squirrels outside. He warned me, however, that 
he was liable to trap lots of the wrong squirrels — ones that weren’t actually 
living in the building. He further warned me that his bait might actually draw 
more squirrels to the roof of the building, where he wanted to place his traps.
That solution didn’t sound perfect. I wondered whether I could come up with 
a better one.
To use problem themes as the starting point for finding a better way to keep 
squirrels out of my office building, I needed to brainstorm some very abstract 
statements of the problem, such as these:
 
✓ How to keep something or someone out
 
✓ How to make sure that someone or something isn’t inside when you plug 
a hole
 
✓ How to catch the right animals, rather than others that happen along
As I looked at the last item in this list, I thought about flapper valves, which 
allow water to go one way but not the other. These valves are used in simple 
pumps all the time. Instead of hammering wire over the holes in the trim, I 
could make a flapper door out of plywood and stiff rubber — or, better yet, 
out of sheet metal and a strong spring hinge. This door would permit an 
animal to push its way out of the hole but not go back in. And wouldn’t the 
same design solve the other problems on my list too? Abstracting the 
problem led me to think of a way to combine my squirrel problem with 
another problem — how to allow water to flow only one way — and come up 
with a more effective solution than the exterminator’s approach of spreading 
kill traps all over my building’s roof and yard.
I’ll make up some one-way squirrel doors and install them over the holes 
the creatures made in my roof trim. If these doors do the trick, maybe I’ll 
commercialize the design. CheckOut might be a good brand name for a new 
line of pest-control products based on this design. Maybe I’ll trademark the 
name as well as apply for a patent. (For details on how to do both things, see 
Chapter 17.)
Getting Resourceful in Your 
Search for Combinations
Remember that the big-picture idea is to innovate. If you’re stuck for a really 
great design or idea, and combinatorial innovation isn’t producing what you 
need, explore some really creative approaches to finding unique combinations.

Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Pairing things that nobody 
thinks should go together
Oxymoron inventions are what I call those improbable combinations that, 
when done in a clever way, so often produce breakthroughs.
 
Here’s an example of an oxymoron: fuel-efficient jets. Airplanes gulp immense 
amounts of jet fuel, so if you want to travel without a big carbon footprint, stay 
on the ground. But wait — as I write this chapter, Boeing is working on a new 
fuel-efficient mid-size plane in an effort to overcome this problem.
Playing with words to find 
unexpected combinations
Word-play inventions use components or ingredients inspired by word combi-
nations. Sometimes, words are similar because they come from the same root 
word. Recognizing a familial relationship between words may help you see 
relationships between the things the words represent, too.
Tablet and table, for example, come from the same root: the Latin word 
tabula, which means board or plank. Planks of wood or slate were used for 
many purposes in ancient Rome. People ate on tables made of tabula and 
wrote letters and records on smaller planks, which is why a table can be a 
grid of information as well as something to serve dinner on.
You don’t have to find logical connections between words to play with them 
and produce creative insights. There’s no particular rhyme or reason to why 
certain words rhyme, but still, a list of words that rhyme is a good starting 
point if you’re looking for possible combinations. Take this list, for example: 
rhyme, dime, time, grime, crime, thyme, prime, and climb. Can you think of a 
new product, using a pairing from this list? How about Time Climb, a game in 
which you start in the Middle Ages and have to climb your way to the present 
by finding all the key inventions along the way. No? Well, how about a cheap 
disposable clock called a Time Dime? I visualize it as a miniature pocket 
watch and timer the size of a dime, made from a simple computer chip and 
LED display, priced at — you guessed it — 10¢.
 
Cereal maker Kellogg Co. often runs brainstorming sessions. During one of the 
sessions, someone asked a creative question: “How can we help people eat 
smarter?” A literal answer to the question wasn’t requested, but one answer 
proved to be insightful: “Why not include something that literally makes 
people smarter?” The result was Live-Bright brain-health bars, now in early 
testing. The bars include DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid that is thought to boost 
brain activity.

193
 Chapter 11: Coming Up with Creative Combinations
Imitating without violating 
intellectual-property rights
Copycat products borrow shamelessly from someone else’s successful prod-
uct concept, even if the concept doesn’t appear to fit another brand or prod-
uct line. Why not give it a try if you have distribution and the other company 
has a good product concept? All you have to do is find a way to combine the 
other company’s concept with some element of your approach or brand to 
make it your own.
 
McDonald’s, the hamburger chain, envied Starbucks’ success, so it introduced 
its own line of supposedly gourmet coffee drinks under the pseudo-French 
name McCafé, using a massive television ad campaign to train customers to 
think of McDonald’s as a legitimate source of lattes.
 
The trick, of course, is to borrow only a good idea — not a patented, trade-
marked, or copyrighted design or expression. See Chapter 17 for information 
on avoiding legal trouble, and check with your lawyer if you have any doubt.
Combining a customer want 
with a solution you can sell
Need-driven inventions are products or services designed to address a need 
or want expressed by consumers and explored through extensive surveys 
and discussion groups.
 
Procter & Gamble’s surveys about laundry detergents revealed that people 
hate it when their clothes age and deteriorate after repeated washings. To 
address this need, P&G identified chemicals designed to preserve fabrics and 
added them to laundry detergent. The result was Tide Total Care, introduced 
in 2009.
Seeking Unusual Information
Combining things is great, but what about combining ideas and information? 
The principle of innovating through combining also applies to intangibles, 
not just tangible things, and you can find your way to a breakthrough design 
by combining ideas and information in fresh ways.
 
Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, for example, combined the candi-
date’s name and image with the concept of change.

194
Part II: Stimulating Your Creative Side: Thinking in New and Different Ways 
Casting a broad net
It’s hard to find information that leads to fresh combinations of ideas. The 
problem is that you don’t know what to look for. A solution wouldn’t be original 
or innovative if it were obvious, right? This problem has an official name: the 
relevance paradox, defined as the difficulty of finding information when you 
don’t already know that it might be helpful or relevant.
In other words, you look for the information that you already know is related 
to your question or goal, but you don’t look for information that you don’t 
know about. So how do you overcome the relevance paradox and find infor-
mation that could help, even though you don’t know about it in advance?
Sometimes, if you gather information at random, you get lucky and hit on a 
surprisingly relevant fact or idea. The trick is to hold your puzzle, problem, 
or objective in your mind as you scan many sources quickly, waiting for 
something to pop out of the flood of information and come to your attention.
 
A more guided way to look for information that you didn’t know would help 
you is to use analogy to guide yourself toward imagined information or solu-
tions. If a business facing bankruptcy is like a sinking ship, what would be the 
equivalent of a radio call to the Coast Guard, or a toolkit containing everything 
needed to patch a hole, or a way to offload the valuable cargo to another ship 
before yours sinks? These three strategies are fairly obvious for sinking ships, 
but could they also be applied to sinking businesses? Well, let’s see. You could 
try the following:
 
✓ Search for turnaround consultants, who, like the Coast Guard, rush in to 
help when a business is about to go down.
 
✓ Look for a short-term patch in the form of emergency financing or a way 
to sell or close the worst-performing line of business.
 
✓ Seek a buyer who will cooperate with a bankruptcy process by acquiring 
your most valuable assets and continuing to service your customers.
Seeking weak signals
You can also look for weak signals — opinions and facts that contradict the 
prevailing wisdom and are outshouted by the mainstream — to find alterna-
tive viewpoints. Usually, you can find people who have contrary opinions or 
different approaches from the mainstream, and if you seek out these contrarians, 
you may find that they have a point. If you operate in an industrial setting, for 
example, find out how small-scale tinkerers in home workshops are tackling 
the same things that you do in factories.

195
 Chapter 11: Coming Up with Creative Combinations
I bet that someone out there has a fresh approach to generating power. One 
farmer, for example, built a cylindrical turbine with its feet in the water of a 
stream, its arms spread to catch the wind, and a round solar panel on top. 
Depending on the weather, the three components contribute differentially, 
but the turbine almost always produces at least a trickle of electricity. I don’t 
know whether the design is worth scaling up, but it might be inspirational to 
someone at a power company.
Trying Unusual Forms
The form that something takes is partly due to necessity. A coffee mug, for 
example, needs to hold liquid, sit flat on a table, and be easy to pick up and 
to sip from. But form is also due to design traditions that can blind us to 
other possibilities.
 
Combining a function with an unfamiliar form can produce breakthrough 
innovations. I saw a fun example of this principle back when the popular 
singer Taylor Swift hosted Saturday Night Live. As hosts are expected to do, 
she opened the show with a humorous monologue. Her opening, however, 
didn’t follow the conventional form of a spoken monologue with pauses for 
(ideally) audience laughter. Instead, she picked up a guitar and proceeded 
to sing a composition titled “My Musical Monologue.” The sketch was clever 
and got a lot of laughs, and the idea of setting it to music worked well for her, 
because she’s a good singer and songwriter but (presumably) an inexperi-
enced monologuer.
What combinations of form and function can you come up with to amaze your 
audience or win customers? Can you offer the same benefit while changing 
the form of your best-selling product?
To help you see how to match new forms to old benefits, think about the benefits 
of a cup of coffee. Can you give someone the same benefits in solid form 
rather than liquid? Sure! I bet that you’ve already come up with coffee ice 
cream packaged in coffee cups and sold alongside hot coffee as a new option, 
right? Or maybe you were thinking about coffee-flavored gum with caffeine 
in it. What — you weren’t? Okay, had you thought of a coffee patch — like a 
nicotine patch, but infused with the caffeine and other xanthenes that give 
coffee its energy- and mood-boosting effects? Or do you have yet another 
possibility in mind?
You can find lots of ways to combine new forms with existing product 
benefits and create breakthrough products. Give it a try!

Clever combinations for designer display boards
No doubt you’ve used a chalkboard, white-
board, or bulletin board. But have you ever 
seen a combination whiteboard and bulletin 
board? How about a corkboard inside a locking 
cupboard to keep your postings neat and 
controlled in a public or semipublic place such 
as a hotel lobby?
These simple combinations, with nice frames 
added, make up a product line with hundreds 
of options for the company Art Concepts 
(www.artconceptsstore.com). Its wall-
board superstore features dozens of categories 
made up of combinations. Combination boards 
are just one example, alongside fabric-covered 
corkboards and fabric-wrapped wallboards. 
Three-way combinations also enrich the 
company’s catalog. The French board, for 
example, is made of cork wrapped in fabric, 
with a crisscross of diagonal ribbons tacked 
to it for holding small pieces of paper or 
photographs.
Imagine the best combination for organizing 
your bulletin board or planning wall, and you 
can have it made in the company’s custom 
board center. Art Concepts shows that simple 
materials, combined in creative ways, are more 
than enough to make a unique and appealing 
line of business.

Applying Creativity

Daily Challenges

In this part . . .
A
s an innovator, you need not approach daily tasks 
the way others do. Your imagination gives you the 
power to bring new perspectives to everything you do, 
from tackling budgets and cost cuts to resolving 
disagreements.
This part helps you decide how to apply your innovative 
ideas to some of the daily routines of the workplace — 
making an impact when communicating with others, 
turning conflicts into opportunities to innovate, and 
improving your organization in the process of seeking 
ways to save money.

Delivering Fresh Presentations 
and Proposals
In This Chapter
▶ Assessing the audience to decide how much creativity is appropriate
▶ Developing a compelling, original point of view
▶ Writing a presentation that convinces others of your point of view
▶ Communicating creatively through your words, visuals, and other elements
▶ Designing slides with creative restraint
▶ Branding your presentation
A
 good presentation is unobtrusively creative. In business and profes-
sional spheres, audiences are rarely looking for wild, crazy, and creative; 
they’re looking for smart, helpful, and insightful. They want you to be profes-
sional and an expert on your topic. Also, of course, they don’t want to be 
bored. But you’re not an entertainer — you’re a presenter. Big difference. 
The entertainer pumps up the laughs, action, or artistic elements to combat 
boredom. The presenter relies on creative insights delivered in a credible 
style.
If you harness creativity in the right ways, your audiences won’t even realize 
you’re being creative. They will notice that you’re interesting and insightful. 
They’ll think you’re smart and well spoken. They’ll be impressed. People will 
come up to you afterward to shake your hand and ask you for advice.
The credibility you need to be a high-impact presenter comes from gaining a 
creative insight on your topic so that you have something fresh and important 
to say and then presenting it in a clean, impressive, and moderately creative 
manner. This chapter walks you through both phases of this process of 
becoming a credible presenter of fresh proposals.

200
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Building the Credibility You 
Need to Be Creative
Credibility is the impression of knowing what you’re talking about and having 
a strong, convincing message. It’s the secret ingredient behind winning 
proposals and popular public speakers. Some executive coaches work 
specifically on credibility — that’s how important it is for top corporate 
leaders. And, of course, politicians who lose credibility don’t get reelected. 
But what about the rest of us? Do you need to be credible too?
If you don’t establish a high degree of credibility right away, your proposals, 
presentations, and sales pitches will be unsuccessful, and your ideas, no 
matter how innovative, will fail for lack of adequate championship. Your first 
goal in planning any business or professional presentation is to figure out 
how to establish your credibility.
If you want to present any fresh, innovative thinking, credibility is especially 
important because it helps you make the case for your ideas. That’s what 
innovators do — successful ones, anyway. Using your credibility to make 
your case means understanding your audience and what they’re likely to 
expect, as well as thinking about how you’ll present yourself and your 
credentials as an innovative thought leader.
Sizing up your audience and context
If you look up “creative presentation ideas” in any Web search engine, you’ll 
be inundated with results. Hundreds of articles and blogs tell you to do 
things like leave the titles off your slides, deliver your presentation blind-
folded, sprinkle homemade cartoons through your slides, add a theme song, 
make everyone get up and dance, or dress like a clown and do tricks. Caution! 
Every one of these ideas is going to get you into trouble with the majority of 
business audiences, because most business and workplace audiences are 
conservative in their views of what a presentation ought to be.
 
A business audience usually expects you, as a presenter, to
 
✓ Conduct yourself professionally, as appropriate to your position and the 
place and time of the presentation.
 
✓ Summarize the conventional wisdom and current thinking on the topic, 
even if you go on to disagree with it.
 
✓ Be organized and clear, which means telling the members of the audience 
what you’re going to tell them and not wasting their time on things they 
consider to be irrelevant.

201
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
 
Most business audiences want you to be traditional in your conduct and 
approach. If you have a good new idea to propose, they’ll listen — provided 
that you establish yourself as a highly credible source.
Providing enough structure 
to reassure the audience
It’s important to project a competent, successful persona when you speak to 
any professional audience, which means dressing somewhat more formally 
than the audience members do and comporting yourself in a calm, profes-
sional manner all (or most) of the time. (Assume business casual dress for 
a conference audience and formal suits for anything in the executive suite.) 
If you’re a good performer, you can slip out of your professional role briefly 
to deliver a punch line or warm up the crowd, as long as you’re able to move 
comfortably back to your professional persona to move the presentation 
along to the next chunk of hard content.
Most audiences prefer a competent, professional, credible presenter who 
seems to be organized and conscientious. Most people, however, are a bit 
disorganized, especially when rattled by stage fright. The conventional 
prescription for stage fright is to know your presentation well. Practice 
delivering it until you know each talking point by heart and don’t have to 
worry about losing your place.
 
To overcome stage fright, it’s important to know your content, but even more 
important is knowing your venue or the context in which you’ll be presenting. 
No amount of practice in front of a friend can prepare you to speak in front 
of 200 strangers. Seek out speaking experiences that build up your audience-
hardiness by exposing you to larger groups and to people you don’t know. 
Volunteer to give presentations at work whenever possible to gain experience 
and build your comfort level. Also consider joining a Toastmasters group 
(www.toastmasters.org), where professionals gather to practice their 
speaking skills.
To appear to be conscientious — namely, organized, structured, and full of 
clear plans and solutions — create numbered lists of steps and options, as 
well as an overall outline for your presentation that breaks it into three to five 
main topic areas along with an introduction and conclusion. These structured 
elements give the audience the reassurance that it instinctively needs, and you 
appear to be organized and on top of things, which is essential to your profes-
sional demeanor and your ability to command the audience’s respect.
 
When you provide enough structure and order to your presentation through 
outlines; numbered lists; and clear, helpful diagrams or charts, you win audience 
members’ respect and trust. They view you as being credible, which gives you 
permission to be creative. Without credibility, any efforts you make to be cre-
ative will fall flat, and your audience will be skeptical of your ideas — and of you.

202
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Engaging the audience
Most business presentations are boring. That’s too bad, because boring 
presentations fail to hold interest and don’t make a strong impression. 
Whatever your purpose and medium, don’t be boring! Standing on your head 
or adding colorful icons to your slides, however, won’t rescue a boring 
presentation. You should use creativity for other purposes, such as to drive 
home a key point in an interesting way or to generate new options or solutions.
 
Don’t try to fluff up a presentation with bad jokes just to avoid being boring. 
Superficial uses of creativity undermine your credibility as a presenter. 
Instead, make sure that the core content of your presentation is significant and 
brief so that it’s inherently interesting to the professionals in your audience.
To avoid boring your audience, follow these rules as you plan and write 
your presentation:
 
✓ Speak for the minimum acceptable period — not the maximum. Less is 
more! If you’re brief, what you say is more likely to be remembered.
 
✓ Deliver the expected. It’s important to reassure audience members by 
showing them that you’re on topic and delivering what they came for. 
If you get too creative, you may fail to deliver the expected, so keep in 
mind that the expected is the foundation of your presentation.
 
✓ Add pleasant surprises on top of the expected. This area is where your 
creativity can do the most good. Build something exciting on top of a 
solid foundation so that you both meet and exceed expectations.
 
✓ Avoid employing overly informal, zany, or superficially creative 
techniques and tricks. Conduct yourself with gravity.
The best way to engage an audience is to have something to say. What’s your 
point? If it’s a compelling one, simply make it, support it, and explain how to 
implement it. Your audience will appreciate the clarity of your thoughts and 
the efficient way in which you present them.
Finding Your Unique Insight
You need to formulate a point of view before you can write a good pre-
sentation. Your particular perspective on the topic ought to be fresh and 
useful, and you can develop a unique point of view by giving your innovative 
instincts free rein.
The following steps help you ensure that your presentation has a unique 
perspective that adds insight to the topic. If you fail to schedule enough time 
for all four of the preparatory phases, you’ll flub the actual presentation by 
simply reciting what you’ve read without adding any insight of your own.

203
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
 
1. Perform background research by
 
• Gathering relevant sources
 
• Reviewing the facts
 
• Making a list of the main problems, concerns, or goals
 
• Finding out what other people have proposed
 
2. Let the information incubate by
 
• Setting the project aside
 
• Sleeping on it
 
• Toying with ideas as you work on other tasks
 
3. Find your insight by
 
• Developing theories
 
• Refining your best ideas
 
• Adopting a unique point of view
 
4. Prepare your presentation by
 
• Organizing facts and thoughts around your unique point of view
 
• Writing your presentation
 
• Editing to make it briefer and more focused
Starting with research
Imagine that you’ve been asked to speak about the economy and how it may 
affect your industry’s future sales. You might prepare by reading articles on 
the topic; examining the effect of past economic cycles on your industry; and 
gathering expert opinions, quotes, and forecasts. If you do all that research, 
however, you still won’t be prepared to write a good presentation, because 
you won’t have your own point of view. In school, students are initially 
expected simply to summarize what adults have to say on a topic. As students 
reach higher levels, they’re expected to develop their own theses and to 
present them with supporting arguments and facts. So are you, because 
you’re an adult, not an elementary-school student!
Ask yourself this question as you study your research: “What is my unique 
point of view on the topic?” If you’ve read multiple sources and compiled a 
good fact base on your topic, you have the raw materials that you need to 
come up with your own thesis.

204
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Incubating the facts until a 
fresh perspective pops out
Converting the raw inputs of information and other people’s opinions into 
your own unique perspective is a creative process. You must allow your 
creative mind to churn and consider the research you’ve done (see the 
preceding section). If you’ve immersed yourself intently in researching the 
topic and gathering source material, you’ll continue to think about the topic 
during your rest period, which is how you tap into the power of incubation. 
Incubation happens when you sit on a topic or question after you’ve hatched 
an “egg” of information about it.
 
Often, it takes a distant viewpoint to see things clearly. Back up by generalizing 
the problem or goal, and see whether a more general statement will help you 
gain insight. Rather than struggle to find an innovative way to reorganize your 
company’s sales force to boost sales (assuming that’s what your assignment 
is), you could ask yourself general questions such as these:
 
✓ How do experts organize routes and territories to minimize drive time 
and maximize efficiency?
 
✓ What conditions produce the highest performances for salespeople?
 
✓ Which territories or types of customers are going to experience the 
greatest future growth?
These are good general questions that anyone might ask in any company. If 
you answer them for your specific business, you’ll almost certainly gain insight 
into how to reorganize your sales force for maximum future sales. Incubating 
insightful questions is a great way to move toward your unique point of view.
Sometimes, your incubation of the problem produces questions that need more 
research. For example, if you think it’s important to find out which territories or 
types of customers are going to experience the greatest future growth, you may 
do some additional research. And from that second round of research, you may 
find that a great thesis pops right out, ready to become the organizing theme of 
your presentation. For example, you may find that the traditionally strong terri-
tories are going to be eclipsed by smaller ones that experience faster growth. 
In that case, your recommendation would be to concentrate your top salespeo-
ple on the emerging territories so as to gain a dominant share of their business 
before your competitors realize how valuable these territories are going to be.
Brainstorming for insight
What if the steps covered in the section “Finding Your Unique Insight” don’t 
work for you? Sometimes, you incubate a topic by sleeping on it (see the 
preceding section), and when you wake up, you still have no clear insight. 

205
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
You can make yourself come up with insight on your topic. Any number of 
creative-thinking techniques can help. Brainstorming, in all its variants, is 
generally the first thing to try (see Chapters 6, 7, and 8), and it’s fine to brain-
storm on your own, even though people usually think of the technique as 
a group activity. Discipline yourself to generate at least a page or flip chart 
of wild ideas. Then back up (literally — step away from the paper) and see 
whether anything pops. Usually, one item in the list proves to be particularly 
helpful, and you may develop and refine it into the point of view you need.
Here’s an example of brainstorming a unique point of view for a presentation — 
in this case, a presentation on the economy’s effect on your industry:
 
1. Research your topic.
 
 Your research tells you that sales lag the economy, so this year’s 
economic growth, or lack thereof, is a good predictor of your industry’s 
future growth. This information isn’t very exciting, however, because 
most people already know it. Your challenge is to address the topic from 
a unique point of view.
 
2. Brainstorm a list of observations about the topic.
 
 Your list includes these items:
 
• Everybody knows that you can predict industry growth based on 
recent economic trends, but people usually don’t bother to do so.
 
• In the last recession, the leading companies were hurt the most 
because they were too aggressive and had to cut way back when 
sales dropped.
 
• In the last growth period, a few smaller companies grew to be 
industry leaders by innovating, but most stayed small.
 
• Most people don’t think that they can do anything about economic 
cycles, so they don’t pay much attention to those cycles.
 
3. Examine your list to see what catches your eye.
 
 As you look at the list, you keep coming back to the observation that 
most people don’t think that they can do anything about economic 
cycles and therefore don’t pay much attention to them. You realize that 
this observation means that many people in your audience won’t think 
your topic is important. You wonder whether this point is actually much 
more important than people realize. Is it a hidden driver of success?
 
4. Develop your chosen thought into a unique point of view in the form 
of a thesis statement, which is a clear, single-sentence answer to a 
question your presentation explores.
 
 Often, your thesis statement is the explanation of an important problem 
or puzzle that concerns the bottom-line performance of a business — 
whether yours or a customer’s or client’s. Your thesis statement should 
be important and nonobvious to your audience so that they feel they 
gain insight by listening to you discuss it.

206
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
 
 For example, as you pose the question “Is the economy a hidden driver 
of success in our industry?”, you sense that you’re finally closing in on 
a unique and interesting point of view. You hypothesize that the major 
changes in market position occur during important shifts in the economic 
cycle and that it would be possible to take advantage of this effect.
 
5. Develop your unique point of view by refining the question.
 
 You might do this as follows: “Economic shifts always shake up our 
industry, and if you prepare, you can take advantage of this effect.” 
Wow! This observation is interesting and valuable. You’ve got yourself a 
great point of view in the form of a thesis statement that addresses the 
perennially popular question of how to be successful in business.
 
When you write your presentation, start by making the statement you come 
up with in Step 5; then support and explore it. I guarantee that your audience 
will be spellbound.
Sometimes, you’ll think you’ve got the perfect point of view to organize your 
presentation around, but when you start to write the script, you see holes 
in your thinking. Don’t be so wedded to your point of view that you insist on 
sticking with it even if it proves to be hard to support.
 
Most people fail to add fundamental value as speakers because they don’t go the 
extra creative mile by finding their unique point of view. Don’t make that mistake. 
Be the standout speaker who really has a fresh, valuable point of view to offer.
Avoiding fixating on the first big idea
If you find yourself worrying about the thesis that you thought you were going 
to use, go back to the beginning (Step 1 in “Finding Your Unique Insight”) and 
start all over again. Yes, this may mean trashing your draft, but if it’s no 
good, it belongs in the trash bin, not at the podium. You aren’t done until
your big idea holds up under the challenge of turning it into a well-reasoned, 
well-organized presentation. Sometimes, getting the insight that you need takes 
several tries.
Outlining a strong framework 
for your presentation
When you have a unique point of view for your presentation, you may design a 
presentation that presents the content in a straightforward, clear, simple 
manner. Think of this first stage of writing as framing the “house” that will even-
tually be your finished presentation. The initial draft is a framework of clear, 
strong sentences that lay out the main points and subpoints of your 
presentation.

207
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
 
You may find it easiest to write this first draft in outline format than in fully 
fleshed-out paragraphs.
With a good, clear, clean, outline-oriented draft in hand, you’re ready to think 
about how to pump up your communications. It’s time to get creative again. 
Consult the next section for ways to give your communication the power of 
subtle, professional creativity.
Making Your Point with the Five 
Tools of Creative Presentation
Your most important contribution to your presentation or proposal is your 
creative insight on the topic. You’re a professional making a presentation, so 
don’t feel like you need to add bells and whistles. You convince your audience 
of your thesis by being credible and well prepared, not by being entertaining.
When you have your content blocked out, you’re ready to think of creative 
ways to make your main points. Confine yourself to five main ways of using 
creativity to make your point more compelling and clear:
 
1. Cite or quote authoritative sources.
 
2. Present relevant and useful facts to prove your point.
 
3. Provide visuals to illustrate your point.
 
4. Offer analogies to help make your point clear and memorable.
 
5. Tell relevant stories about people or businesses.
Use these five techniques gently. Don’t overuse them. One fairly lengthy 
story is enough, for example. Also, if you have three tables of impressive 
statistics, avoid the temptation to add ten more tables. Each technique grows 
old quickly. Audiences like variety.
Figure 12-1 illustrates how to bring creative persuasion into your presentation 
in professional, appropriate ways.
When it comes to how you’ll make your main points, keep in mind that a 
good presentation is unobtrusively creative. The techniques in the preceding 
list are unobtrusive ways to add some creative power to your presentation, 
so long as you don’t overuse any of them.
 
Never use creativity to fluff up a presentation or cover up a lack of substance. 
Avoid using the gimmicks that many presentation coaches suggest. Don’t 
feel that you have to work humor into your presentation, for example, unless 
you’re naturally funny, your humor is clearly relevant to the topic, and your 

208
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
humor couldn’t possibly offend anyone. Those constraints are big ones, 
though, so usually, humor is inappropriate. Also avoid using theatrical tricks. 
You aren’t a trained actor. Most of the gimmicks that you find in books on 
spicing up presentations are going to fall flat and make you look like you’re 
trying too hard to entertain.

Incorporating sources and facts
Every high school and college student knows that sources and facts are the 
bedrock of a good paper, so why do people forget to use them as soon as 
they graduate and go to work? I think that adults have a natural instinct to 
suppress our paper-writing experiences, but it’s helpful to keep in mind the 
core lesson: Build up a solid base of sources and facts in support of your 
thesis statement.
Even if you think that you’ve done enough homework, think again. By the 
time you incubate your original research and come up with the thesis that 
will form your unique point of view, your fact base may be out of step with 
your evolving argument.
Make a list of three essential facts that would lend the greatest support and 
credibility to your thesis. Then, if you don’t already have them at hand, go 
and find those facts stated by authoritative sources. If you plan to say that 
children younger than 16 create most of the new fashion trends these days, 
for example, you could bolster that thesis with

209
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
 
✓ A quote from a designer saying that she gets great ideas from her children
 
✓ Statistics on how many of the last ten hot fads started with children
 
✓ Statistics showing that the spending power of children is increasing
 
When you present three good facts from authoritative sources, you convince 
most audience members of your point. If you want to provide additional 
support and proof, do so cautiously to avoid overwhelming the audience. 
If you go on and list ten more facts, most audience members will forget the 
first three. Don’t overwhelm them with a list of facts that drives the three 
strongest proofs out of their minds.
Engaging the mind’s eye with good visuals
Exactly how many words is a picture worth? Wrong question. Pictures don’t 
substitute for words; they illustrate the words. Don’t try to substitute a 
picture for any of the words in your presentation. Add pictures (including 
graphs, photographs, and videos) only if they work as powerful illustrations 
of important points.
Knowing when and how to use graphs
Use graphs when you need to make statistics clearer. Here’s how:
 
✓ Line graphs: Trends should be illustrated with traditional line graphs 
showing time moving to the right and quantity moving vertically. Use an 
X mark for each data point, and connect the points with a line to help 
the eye see the trend or direction of movement.
 
✓ Bar charts: Use bar charts to compare statistics, such as sales by region. 
Avoid cramming more than six bars onto a single graph.
 
✓ Pie charts: Use pie charts to show how something is divided. You can 
illustrate what percentage of your sales comes from what products, for 
example, by showing each product as a slice of pie.
That’s about it. I don’t recommend using more-complex types of graphs. 
Keep it simple when it comes to graphs, because many people have difficulty 
reading them.
Incorporating photographs and videos
Show as you tell by providing a good, clear picture of your subject. As you talk 
about teens and their fashion trends, show several pictures of teenagers wearing 
current fashions. As you talk about your products and which are selling best, 
show photos of the products. You get the idea. The basic rule of illustrating a 
presentation is the old saw “Keep it simple, stupid!” (KISS).
Illustrate anything that’s best seen rather than heard. If a video would illustrate 
the use of your product better than a still photograph would, use the video. 

210
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Don’t go beyond that simple goal, however. As with everything in your 
presentation, less is more when it comes to visuals. If you have only a few 
graphs and photographs, you can allow the audience to look at them longer, 
which means people may actually remember what you show and tell them.
 
Don’t include video unless it really adds value. Video takes up presentation 
time and competes for the spotlight with you, the presenter.
Here’s a good rule: Show, but don’t show off. Restraint is the key to effective 
illustration in any professional presentation. Too often, presenters include a 
flashy video, a series of impressive photos, or a deck of complex graphs just 
because they hope that the audience will be impressed. Business audiences 
aren’t impressed by excess, though; they’re impressed by restraint.
An analogy is like a newly 
cleaned window
Analogies offer fresh new viewpoints on the subject. They engage the right 
side of the brain, which is where creative thought and intuition are based. 
When you use an analogy, you get your audience to engage creatively as well 
as logically. That’s a good thing! People find presenters more interesting and 
presentations more persuasive when they have engaged both sides of their 
brains in the process of listening and watching. Analogies are great for 
engaging the whole brain by stimulating a little subconscious creative 
thought on the part of your audience.
To show you how an analogy stimulates the audience to think creatively, 
I want you to reread the header at the top of this section: “An analogy is like 
a newly cleaned window.” To get this analogy, your brain has to visualize a 
newly cleaned window and then figure out how it relates to the point.
How does it relate? Well, a newly cleaned window is easy to see through. 
It entices. It draws the eye over to it and makes you want to look out (or in?) 
to see what’s there. An analogy does the same thing in a more abstract way: 
It gets the audience to look at your point from a fresh perspective. The 
analogy attracts attention because it’s a new way to see the subject.
How analogies engage the audience’s imagination
After your audience members have digested your analogy and figured out 
what the connection is, they may not know it, but they’re significantly more 
engaged in your presentation. You’ve just gotten them to do an activity for 
you. This activity went on in the right frontal lobes of their brains, so nobody 
noticed but you.
Even though processing an analogy is an invisible activity, it’s a very powerful 
one. It builds engagement with your presentation and strengthens agreement 
with your point.

211
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
A surefire way to create great analogies
To come up with your own analogies, ask yourself this question: “What is [fill 
in your subject] like?” If I’m preparing to talk to a group of inventors about 
how to market their new ideas, I might ask myself, “What is a new invention 
like?” To answer my question, I may write it at the top of a chart pad or dry-
erase board and then force myself to brainstorm a list of possible answers. 
A new invention is like
 
✓ A mongrel puppy, because it’s cute and appealing, but you don’t know 
what it will look like when it grows up
 
✓ A new baby that needs lots of care and feeding before it’s ready to walk 
on its own two feet
 
✓ A sand castle on a beach — and you don’t know whether the tide’s going 
away from it or about to wash over it
 
✓ A steaming-hot plate of food just out of the oven, which is best served 
while it’s hot and shouldn’t be neglected until it gathers flies
Think about each analogy until you can see the point it supports; then pick 
the analogy that buttresses the point you most want to make. If I want to 
argue that inventors shouldn’t sit on their ideas, but rush out and seek support 
for them right away, I might use the analogy that an invention is a hot plate 
of food just out of the oven that ought to be served quickly. I actually find, 
however, that most inventors take their ideas into the world prematurely. 
Therefore, I probably would use the analogy that an invention is like a new 
baby that has to be supported for several years before it gets its balance and 
even begins to walk on its own feet.
Telling tales
I intentionally put storytelling at the end of my list of creative presentation 
techniques because I want you to try the other four techniques first (see the pre-
ceding sections for details on using sources, facts, visuals, and analogies). The 
first four techniques are easier to hang on your outline than stories are, because 
stories take time and attention away from the main story: your presentation.
 
Stories have tremendous power when they’re used right, but use them 
cautiously because of their tendency to hog the spotlight.
Weaving a story into the threads of your presentation
A wonderful way to use a story is to find a case history (an actual example or 
a fictional one) that you can weave throughout your presentation. Introduce 
the main character of your story and his or her goal or dilemma in your intro-
duction; then return to the story briefly at the end of each section of your 
talk to show how the main point of that section applies to the story. As you 
work through your topic outline, you also work through the chapters of your 

212
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
story, so that both the story and your presentation keep pace and climax at 
the end. When you do things this way, the story never hogs the spotlight; it 
has to share the spotlight as you alternate between storytelling and presenting 
the gist of your content.
Another good way to use a story is to set up the problem you’re going to 
solve. Early in your presentation, introduce a brief case history or example of 
a person or organization that ran into trouble; then explain that you’re going 
to show the audience how to avoid the pitfall that so-and-so fell into. The 
story helps the audience get personally engaged in your topic.
Condensing your story into appealing sound bites
Stories need to be brief and clear. Avoid using more than three characters — 
the people or organization that the story is about.
Suppose that I decide to share a story about Barbara, an inventor who ran 
into all sorts of problems as she struggled to bring her new product to 
market. I know that this inventor’s story involves a whole cast of characters: 
her consultant (me), her graphic designer, her patent attorney, her product 
engineering team, her bankers, and so on. To make the story compelling and 
clear for the sake of a presentation, I must narrow it down and simplify it. 
Audience members don’t need to find out everything about this inventor; 
they just need to know the most compelling and relevant aspects of Barbara’s 
lengthy story. Good storytelling keeps the plot and characters simple.
 
When you tell your main story, dim your slides and approach the audience to 
create a different context for the story. The audience will focus on you more fully 
and pay close attention to your story, and they’ll appreciate the chance of pace.
Avoiding being upstaged by the story
A great test of any story is whether you can tell it in one minute or less. If not, 
go back to the drawing board and find ways to shorten the telling.
If you have personal stories that illustrate your central point, include one or 
two — but no more than that. Even if you’re a celebrity, the audience will lose 
interest in your personal life history surprisingly quickly. I’m sorry to be the 
bearer of bad news, but it’s not actually all about you. Your presentation is the 
star; you’re simply supporting it. Don’t let your own stories hog the spotlight, 
but let the spotlight shine on your main point. That way, everyone will leave 
the room knowing what you think, and most of them will agree with you.

213
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
Branding Your Message with an 
Appropriate Look and Style
When you’ve drafted your presentation or proposal and gathered appropriate 
sources, facts, visuals, analogies, and stories to support it, you’re ready to 
package it in a clean, consistent, appealing style. The following sections break 
down the primary elements that contribute to the style of your presentation.
Matching tone and style
Your tone and style may range from animated and informal to contained, 
professional, and formal, depending on your content, context, and audience. 
If you’re giving a formal talk on a serious topic to a high-level professional 
audience in a formal lecture hall, for example, choose a formal, self-contained 
style, and look, speak, act, and dress accordingly.
Creating a visual signature
Your visual signature is the look or style of all slides, handouts, backdrops, 
charts, videos, and other visual elements, including your outfit. Choose a 
visual signature that fits the tone and style of your presentation. A serious, 
professional topic needs a visual style that emphasizes a clean, professional 
look through conservative colors, traditional font choices, and formal-looking 
graphs or charts.
Choosing colors for your slides and handouts
Select a color scheme that’s modestly creative and fits the tone and style 
of your presentation. For a formal presentation, for example, choose your 
colors from a palette of blue, black, and white, with an occasional very small 
splash of red or gold worked in for contrast. Sorry, that’s it! Green, purple, 
orange, and other colors belong only in informal presentations.
You may think that limiting your color palette to blue, black, and white will 
cripple your creativity when it comes to graphic design of your slides and 
handouts. Not so! Some of the greatest works of art were done in black and 
white. In fact, it’s easier to create an elegant, clean, appealing look when you 
limit your palette. You can use a gentle gradient of light blues in the back-
ground, for example, with the headline in dark blue and the bullet points 
below it in black. If you combine this color scheme with a nice contrast 
between a headline font of 44-point Arial or Helvetica and 32-point text in the 
same font, you’ll have a very clean, appealing graphic look.

214
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Also, to add more graphic interest to a slide or handout with an Arial header, 
switch the body copy to a contrasting font, such as Times New Roman. If you 
do, check readability by backing away from your computer screen a few 
yards. Is the new font still readable? If not, go back to Arial, which is highly 
readable from a distance.
 
One exception to the rule of limiting your main palette to blue, black, and 
white comes into play when the topic of your presentation has its own color 
scheme. You may want to use that scheme instead. For example, a sales 
representative for a drug company may design a presentation about a new 
drug by using the colors from the drug’s orange-and-green logo. However, to 
keep those orange- and green-themed slides or handouts professional and 
easy to read, most of the text should remain black. Stay as close to the core 
professional palette as you can, and use brand colors for accents rather than 
for your main text or headers.
Creating an effective design
Here are other design elements that you can use to add creative appeal to a 
slide in subtle, professional ways:
 
✓ Alternate among one-column text, two-column text, and graphs to vary 
the format.
 
✓ Introduce a single straight line between the header and the text, repro-
ducing that line in the same position on every slide. Yes, I know that this 
line is a very simple and conservative design element, but keep in mind 
that good presentations are unobtrusively creative.
 
✓ If you want to get really radical, place a border (perhaps in a contrasting 
color) around the text, or use a small logo or photo in the bottom-right 
corner of every slide. The border or logo unifies the varied slide formats, 
making it clear that graphs, bulleted lists, and multicolumn bulleted lists 
all belong to the same presentation.
Adding a logo
The visual logo should relate directly to the topic. Use a large version of the 
logo on the title slide and a smaller version at the bottom of all other slides.
You can get creative with your visual logo as long as you keep the design simple, 
small, and relevant. See Chapter 4 for tips on how to design creative brand 
identities, including logos and titles that you can use for your presentations.
 
I’m helping update a one-week course on leadership and management for the 
U.S. Coast Guard, and the slides in the new deck have a deep-blue background 
color, white text, and a small photograph of a Coast Guard cutter racing 
through the water. The boat is in the bottom-right corner of the slide, and it’s 
white with the Coast Guard’s distinctive red stripe across its bow. This boat 
isn’t an official U.S. Coast Guard logo but an image selected specifically for 
these slides; it gives the entire set an appealing and consistent image.

Knowing the difference between good and bad design
Figure 12-2 shows good and bad uses of creative graphic design for profes-
sional presentations. As the figure demonstrates, gratuitous use of design 
elements can be confusing, overwhelming the content and the presenter.

What NOT to do
• Don’t confuse creativity with gimmicks!
• Restraint is important.
• One or a few main design elements

The bad example mixes many fonts, each of them fun and interesting but 
none of them appropriate for a professional presentation. It also uses too 
many visual elements. The sticky-note theme with a faint star in the middle 
doesn’t relate to the topic or add any value; it’s simply distracting. The artist’s 
palette from the clip-art menu also fails to add value, and it increases the 
visual business of a slide that’s already too busy.
The good example in Figure 12-2 sticks to one font, Arial, using a large, bold 
version of it for the headline. It also uses much more white space (open space 
around and between the design elements). The lines are farther apart, and 
the slide has a calmer, cleaner, more open style, which makes it much more 
readable and pleasant to look at.
The only artistic design elements in the good example are the two lines 
that define the area for the text and an old-fashioned key at the bottom of 
the slide. This key is the logo for the presentation, which I plan to call “The 
Key to Effective Presentations.” Placing the key at the bottom of every slide 
reminds audience members of the title of my presentation, thereby effectively 
branding it in their minds.
Repeating your auditory signature
Your auditory signature consists of one or a few phrases or keywords that you 
weave into your presentation often enough to embed them in the memory of 
the audience members.

216
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Avoiding slide-design pitfalls
It’s easy to get creative in designing your slides. 
Most presenters use Microsoft PowerPoint to 
make their slides, which is fine, because the 
program is easy to use and hardly ever crashes 
during a presentation. PowerPoint, however, 
offers many negative temptations. Here are 
some things to avoid doing when you design 
slides for your presentation:
 ✓ Don’t use WordArt. WordArt is a selection 
of comic-book-style fonts, using curvy, 
colorful 3-D characters. It can make a word 
look really fancy. But you aren’t selling 
words; you’re selling your argument. Treat 
it with dignity by using traditional fonts.
 ✓ Don’t use free clip art unless it really, truly 
is a good illustration of a point. PowerPoint 
users have access to lots of clip art, but 
very little of it helps you hammer home a 
key point.
 ✓ Don’t use too many slides. People almost 
always create too many slides when they 
first draft their slide decks. More may 
seem to be better, especially if you’re 
anxious about what you’ll say, but if you have 
dozens of slides, you’ll be reduced to read-
ing them out loud with your back to the room, 
and no one will remember a word you said.
 
 Try to give yourself at least a minute per 
slide. If your presentation involves rich 
slides that contain graphs or multiple 
bullet points, give yourself three to five 
minutes per slide. Based on that formula, 
a 20-minute presentation doesn’t need 
more than 10 to 15 slides.
 ✓ Don’t use backgrounds that include 
recognizable objects (such as balloons, 
bridges, chalkboards, clipboards, flags, 
paper currency, or clouds). These objects 
are cute for the first few slides but grow 
tiresome and distracting long before your 
presentation is done.
 ✓ Don’t use unconventional, hard-to-read 
fonts, either alone or in combination. Good 
graphic design is subtle, not presumptuous.
Your signature should relate to your main point. For example, if your thesis 
is that sales territories should be realigned to focus effort on fast-growing 
regions, you may want to keep reminding your audience that it’s important 
to “organize for the future,” and you may use that phrase as the title of your 
presentation, too.
Controlling your body language
After choosing your style, visual signature, and auditory signature, ask yourself 
how your body language can best support these other elements. If you’re pre-
senting in an exciting, informal style to a youthful audience, your body language 
probably ought to be informal and relaxed. You may see yourself sitting on the 
edge of the stage, taking questions and offering unscripted answers.
If you chose a formal tone and style, your body language should be more 
controlled and formal to match your tone and to go with your formal clothing 

217
 Chapter 12: Delivering Fresh Presentations and Proposals
and demeanor. Keep your hand gestures fairly modest and controlled, and 
stay on your feet, with your jacket on the whole time. Don’t let your nonverbal 
behavior clash with the rest of your presentation.
 
Whether your style is informal and relaxed or formal and upright, smile at 
your audience from time to time. Work a smile in when you’re introduced and 
when you’re thanking the host for the opportunity to speak. Also smile when 
you’re listening to a question or comment from the audience. It’s natural to 
frown when you’re listening intently, but overcoming this natural tendency 
makes a huge difference in how the audience sees and remembers you. 
Audiences tend to rate smiling presenters as being smarter and more creative 
than others, and they tend to agree with presenters who smile. Practice 
smiling while you listen.

L
ife is full of conflicts. Why should business be any different? There are 
conflicts with co-workers, employees, managers, customers, and suppliers. 
Then there are occasionally really nasty conflicts — often about the disputed 
terms of a business contract — involving legal action or the threat of it.
The average small business has a dozen conflicts a year, by my estimate, not 
counting minor disputes that don’t have much effect on the bottom line. A 
big business or a large government entity such as an agency or city, on the 
other hand, may have hundreds of conflicts that need care and attention in 
the course of a year.
Before responding to a conflict, stop and consider creative options and what 
you may be able to propose that could change the conflict for the better. 
This chapter shows you how to take a creative approach and how to innovate 
solutions that improve the outcome over what it initially looked like you 
would be stuck with as a result of a conflict. Redefine conflicts as opportunities to 
cooperate in innovative problem-solving, and you’ll soon find yourself looking 
forward to conflicts rather than worrying about them.
Turning Conflicts into Creative 
Opportunities
Each business conflict is an opportunity to transform what initially seems like 
a simple tug-of-war or power struggle into a creative solution that gives some-
thing of benefit to all parties involved. Good things can come from conflicts. 
Put on your innovator’s hat whenever you see tempers flaring or legal claims 
rising, and see whether you can create a new and better outcome than those 

220
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
initially on the table. It’s amazing how often you can transform a conflict into an 
opportunity to better the situation if you simply reframe the struggle by opening 
your creativity toolbox instead of reaching for the nearest verbal weapons.
Identifying conflicts with rich 
potential for innovation
What makes a conflict a great candidate for an innovative approach? First, 
the outcome must matter. The outcome is what’s at stake — what the parties 
to the conflict are hoping or striving for.
It’s amazing how many conflicts are really quite trivial. People get caught up 
in the heat of the moment and invest a lot of emotional energy in something 
that really doesn’t matter. Jockeying for position when cars are merging on 
a road, for example, is foolish because when the cars get in line and up to 
speed again, a difference of 30 feet one way or the other is going to amount 
to only a second or two of travel time. But that fact doesn’t stop drivers from 
getting quite agitated and angry about whose turn it ought to be.
 
When you look at the conflicts in your workplace, select only those with 
potentially significant outcomes for innovative problem-solving.
Imagine that you’re in a dispute with a printer. The printing company had 
said it could print your next catalog for the same price as the previous one, 
but now it claims that too much time has passed and costs have gone up, so 
it has to bill you 20 percent more. Ouch! Finding a way to reduce or eliminate 
that cost increase would make a definite difference in your bottom line, 
which makes your dispute with the printer a good candidate for a creative 
approach to conflict.
Next, assess the potential complexity of the conflict. In many aspects of 
life, complexity seems to be undesirable, but in conflict, complexity is good 
because it suggests many alternative approaches. A simple argument about 
whether your waste hauler will come into your parking lot to make a pickup 
or whether you’ll have to carry your trash out to the street isn’t going to offer 
a lot of opportunity for creative redefinition. If the company’s driver really 
won’t drive his truck up to your loading dock to make the pickup, fire that 
company and hire a competitor that’s more eager for the work.
A series of meetings with the union representing nurses in your hospital, 
on the other hand, is potentially complex, because there are many possible 
terms and conditions to be considered and because the work itself is com-
plex and varied. Therefore, a union negotiation is a wonderful candidate 
for innovation. Such negotiations usually aren’t done in a creative manner, 
however, so the opportunity for breakthroughs is passed by. Make sure that 
you take an innovative approach whenever the conflict is complex and has a 
significant outcome.

221
 Chapter 13: Negotiating Creative Win–Wins
Reframing the disagreement to introduce 
creative problem-solving
Reframing means offering a new perspective or way of seeing the conflict. 
It’s a high-level skill that takes some practice and self-possession but is well 
worth mastering. The most effective and experienced negotiators use reframing, 
and you can benefit from their example. Here’s a three-step method for 
reframing that works quite well:
 
1. Listen to the general way that the other party is thinking about the 
conflict, not to specific claims or complaints.
 
 Ask yourself this clarifying question: “What do they think this conflict is 
fundamentally all about?”
 
 A business partner who complains that you’re not holding up your end 
of an agreement might really be focusing on the fact that his company 
isn’t making as much profit as expected. Instead of saying that, though — 
because contracts usually don’t guarantee profits — he’s attacking you 
for lots of minor issues as a way to blame you for the problem.
 
2. Think about the best way to view the conflict — an approach that 
could open more possibilities for successful discussion and cooperative 
problem-solving.
 
 Your goal is to redefine the problem in a way that helps generate more 
and better possible solutions. You may decide that an angry business 
partner’s complaints are best viewed as symptoms of a changing 
marketplace, because that could lead to innovative approaches to 
improving sales for both of you.
 
3. Explain that you don’t see the conflict the same way that the other 
party does.
 
 Say, “What I think this is really about is . . . “ Fill in the blank with a clear, 
well-considered statement of an underlying problem that could form a 
productive focus for creative problem-solving.
 
 If the other party ignores your statement and continues to argue from 
her viewpoint, reiterate your statement and let her know, politely but 
firmly, that right now you’re interested in discussing the matter you’ve 
raised — not other matters. Explain that you’re making this request 
because you’re sure that it will help both of you move forward.
Your reframing needs to be based on a clear understanding of the underlying 
issues. Your superior insight gives your argument strength and ensures that 
the other side will consider your viewpoint.
 
Usually, reframing a conflict needs to evoke a sense of shared concerns. Say 
“we” rather than “you” to signal that the new viewpoint is a shared one. You 
might tell an angry business partner that instead of bickering about who gets 

222
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
what part of a dwindling profit margin, “We need to look together at ways of 
improving the profit margin so that the original agreement will once again be 
profitable for us both.”
 
By framing the discussion around shared interests, you help the other party 
take a more cooperative problem-solving approach. Reframing is a way to try 
to get him to come around to your side of the table — metaphorically or 
literally, if you’re meeting in a formal setting.
Signaling your good intentions 
to create buy-in
At first, the other side may not believe that you have good intentions. People 
tend to be suspicious in conflict situations, so they get defensive, which 
means that they assume they’re under attack. Take care to signal your good 
intentions in every way you can (except by conceding any points — it’s still 
early in the conflict, and you don’t need to commit to anything yet!). Here are 
some ways to signal good intentions:
 
✓ Ask for more details about the other party’s complaints or concerns.
 
✓ Listen respectfully to complaints or concerns, without interrupting or 
arguing. (A time for debate may come later, but not now.)
 
✓ Ask for examples or evidence of the problem to help you understand or 
diagnose it.
 
✓ Keep a calm, friendly demeanor as you continue to signal that you want 
to problem-solve. If the other party tries to start a fight or argument, 
return to your reframing of the conflict as a problem for both sides that 
needs to be improved through joint action. Be firm and clear that you 
want to problem-solve rather than argue.
Beginning the dialogue 
with easy win–wins
 
Don’t make the mistake of diving into the thorniest issue first. The people 
on the other side may want to get you to do this, because that issue probably 
is the one they’re most worried about. It’s more productive, however, to pick 
the low-hanging fruit first — in other words, to tackle some easier problems 
and show that you can resolve them to everyone’s satisfaction. That method 
builds confidence, trust, and momentum for the tougher issues.

 Chapter 13: Negotiating Creative Win–Wins
Assessing Everyone’s Conflict Styles
People are individuals, of course, which means that each of us tackles 
conflict in his or her own way. Fortunately, people follow some broad 
patterns of behavior in responding to conflict:
 
✓ Engagers versus avoiders: Some people naturally engage, wanting to 
assert their interests and get involved; others find conflict so unpleasant 
that they want to walk away. Those who engage naturally are able to 
collaborate or compete without feeling uncomfortable about conversing 
with someone who disagrees with them.
 
 Is the person you’re dealing with a natural engager, or does he seem 
uncomfortable with the whole idea of conflict? If one of you is uncom-
fortable with disputes, you’ll need to overcome that instinct to engage 
in collaborative problem-solving and find an innovative solution.
 
✓ Competitors versus collaborators: Some people naturally compete to 
stick up for their own interests; others are more agreeable and want to 
try to take care of everyone, not just themselves.
 
 Which type of person are you? Which type is your opponent? If one of 
you is competitive by nature, you’ll need to overcome that instinct to 
work toward an innovative outcome.
When you define yourself or anyone else on both of these main dimensions of 
conflict behavior, you get five possible conflict-handling styles: collaboration, 
competition, compromise, avoidance, and accommodation. Of these styles, only 
the collaborative approach to conflict can produce a good innovative win–win 
outcome, so you may need to manage everyone’s conflict behavior to make 
sure that everyone uses the correct style. This means recognizing what style or 
approach people are taking in a conflict and not being drawn into responding 
in kind. Instead, reassure competitors that it’s okay to let down their guard and 
collaborate. With avoiders, you also need to reassure them — but in a different 
way, by showing them that it’s safe and not stressful to problem-solve with you. 
Everyone can collaborate, even if it’s not their first instinct to do so.
Identifying the natural collaborators
People who naturally like to collaborate (rather than compete, compromise, 
accommodate, or avoid) are people who
 
✓ Tend to be trusting and trustworthy
 
✓ Are naturally team-oriented and somewhat selfless
 
✓ Appreciate other people’s perspectives and can see more than one side 
of an argument
 
✓ Are open-minded and probably of above-average intelligence

224
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Collaborators make natural innovators because they like to explore ways 
of improving the outcomes for everyone. Their generous instinct to try to 
take care of both sides leads them to want to find better outcomes, and that 
desire to improve on the initial set of options is precisely what starts the 
creative problem-solving process.
Reassuring the competitive negotiators
A competitive approach is characterized by secretive behavior and a focus 
on what’s in it for you, not the other side. Many people take a competitive 
approach in conflicts and negotiations. That approach is fine when you’re 
trying not to be fleeced by a used-car salesman, but if you’re trying to resolve 
disagreement in a project team or with a long-term supplier or distributor, 
it only makes things worse.
If people seem to be unwilling to discuss their concerns openly and won’t 
share their information with you, you can assume that they’re being competitive. 
Point out the advantages of a more open process, and reassure them that 
they won’t give anything away by sharing information or ideas. To innovate a 
better solution to the conflict, you have to agree to consider options without 
commitment to them. You might explore the idea of giving something up in 
exchange for something else and then change your mind if the deal doesn’t 
work out.
Competitors hold other people to their concessions and won’t allow them to 
take those concessions back, which keeps people from feeling free to explore 
options. Make it clear to them that problem-solving isn’t a formal, competitive 
negotiation and that you have every right to trial-balloon ideas without being 
forced to commit to them.
Making sure that your own style 
is consistent with your goals
What’s your style? Are you competitive (or do you appear to be)? If you hesitate 
to share all your information with the other party, she may read you as being 
competitive and won’t take your invitation to collaborate at face value.
The best way to generate open-minded, creative discussion of options and 
solutions is to set an example of this behavior yourself. Ignore (for the 
moment) the conflicting sides and positions, roll up your sleeves, and act as 
though everyone is working together to solve a big problem. Your example 
will do a great deal to get everyone in a problem-solving frame of mind. 
It’s always more effective to show people what to do than it is to tell them.

225
 Chapter 13: Negotiating Creative Win–Wins
Bridging the Gaps to Form an Ad Hoc 
Problem-Solving Team
When you reframe the conflict or negotiation as a creative problem-solving 
effort (see the preceding sections), and when you guide everyone toward 
a collaborative style, you make teamwork possible. As you work on the 
conflict, keep in mind what it feels like when you’ve been in freewheeling 
brainstorming sessions with a friendly group of people who are committed to 
finding a breakthrough innovation. That’s the style and feel you want — not 
the normal take-sides atmosphere of conflicts.
Sharing your own interests and issues first
To set a good example of teamwork during a conflict, don’t talk about your 
demands or positions, and definitely don’t make threats or ultimatums. Instead, 
talk openly — and with faith that anything is possible — about your real needs 
or concerns.
The act of opening up to share your concerns and thoughts honestly and 
without competitiveness encourages others to do the same and sets the 
stage for innovative problem-solving instead of straight competition. Instead 
of opening with a tough demand, you may open with an explanation of your 
concerns, followed by an attempt to describe what you think the other side’s 
concerns may be. Then ask them if you’ve gotten it right or if they would like 
to add to or modify your summary of their concerns.
Building a creative problem-solving team
Sometimes, you need to change or expand the number of people involved 
in the conflict before you can innovate your way through it. Ask yourself 
whether the people who are talking (or arguing) would make a good brain-
storming group; then, assuming that they come up with a good solution, ask 
yourself whether they have the expertise and authority to implement an inno-
vative solution (see Chapter 6). Often, the parties to a conflict or negotiation 
aren’t capable of innovating, for reasons such as these:
 
✓ They lack the imagination or breadth of knowledge needed to generate 
fresh, innovative perspectives on the conflict.
 
✓ They lack the enthusiasm and authority to implement a solution, 
because innovative solutions to problems often involve changes in 
procedures and organizations.

226
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Going farther with honesty 
and straightforwardness
A group of nurses once sat down with their 
union representative to renegotiate their 
contracts with a hospital. Management from 
the hospital sent the head of human resources 
and a lawyer, who sat on the other side of the 
table and initiated a very formal, somewhat 
antagonistic negotiation. Then one of the 
senior nurses said, “Look, most of us have other 
offers. There’s a shortage of nurses in our area. 
And some of us are going to take those offers 
because we don’t like the way we’re treated. 
Some of the doctors are really rude and critical 
of us, often for no good reason.”
The lawyer for the hospital interrupted with 
the objection that her complaint had nothing to 
do with the terms of the employment contract. 
The nurse replied, “Actually, our treatment 
has everything to do with our contract. See, 
if this continues to be an unpleasant place to 
work, we’re going to demand more salary and 
benefits, and we’re going to hold out for every 
little thing — more generous overtime, more 
vacation and sick days, better parking. You 
name it, we’ll fight for it, because we don’t think 
we’re treated well or respected. Now, if you 
want to ignore the underlying problems with 
how nurses are treated, you can pay us enough 
more that we’ll put up with the bad treatment, 
or you can get some of the doctors in here 
and start working on what we really care 
about: respect.”
This nurse’s honesty startled the other 
negotiators, but she was so senior and so well 
respected that they took her seriously. Along 
with a new contract, they initiated a series of 
meetings involving both doctors and nurses, in 
which a skilled mediator helped them identify 
their issues and discuss how to work better 
together. The nurses were pleased that many 
of the doctors improved their conduct, and turn-
over went down. Also, the contract negotiations 
went fairly smoothly as a result of this additional 
initiative to improve working conditions.
It’s not surprising that people or groups in conflict aren’t always perfect 
problem-solving teams. Before you proceed with the discussion, you need to 
recognize what the group lacks and expand your conflict group by supplement-
ing it with people who can help you find and implement a breakthrough. Treat 
the conflict just as you would any other opportunity to innovate. Don’t treat it 
the way that people normally treat conflicts, bringing to the table only people 
who have a direct interest in the conflict and strong opinions about it. Expand 
the number of people until you have a good group — one that’s able to take an 
objective, creative perspective and consider fresh viewpoints and alternatives.
Transitioning to Solution Brainstorming
The most powerful thing you can say in any conflict or negotiation is “How 
would you complete that sentence?” It’s an interesting question, because 
the answer reveals how people think about conflicts. Many people think that 

227
 Chapter 13: Negotiating Creative Win–Wins
the most powerful thing you can say in any conflict or negotiation is “No,” 
because it means that you’re sticking up for your own interests and not being 
overly accommodating. Others argue that “Yes” is the most powerful word, 
because it suggests that you’re getting to agreement. (In fact, a famous book 
about negotiation is Getting to Yes, by William L. Ury, Roger Fisher, and Bruce 
M. Patton [Houghton Mifflin Harcourt].)
 
I find that the most powerful thing you can say in any conflict or negotiation is 
this: “Let’s look at multiple options before deciding.”
If you offer this suggestion, and people ignore it or look at you like you’re from 
Mars, repeat it with more specificity. You may need to say, “I won’t agree to 
anything until we’ve looked at a minimum of five alternatives.” What this asser-
tion does is force the others to begin thinking about multiple options, which 
puts them at least one step down the creativity path. They may think that 
you’re being difficult and may tell you so (perhaps in colorful language), but be 
firm in your insistence on examining multiple options before making any 
commitments. In the end, if they want to resolve the conflict with you, they 
have to give in to this demand for creative thinking about the conflict.
Making sure that everyone knows 
it’s safe to share ideas
There are four main reasons why people don’t share ideas freely 
during conflicts:
 
✓ They fear that what they say may be used against them.
 
✓ They want to use some of their knowledge against the other side.
 
✓ They don’t have many ideas.
 
✓ They don’t believe that the outcome will be better if they problem-solve 
rather than compete.
Of these four reasons, the first two are all about trust. If you think that the 
other side will exploit a weakness or leverage a need or constraint to pressure 
you to agree to a bad deal, you certainly won’t be open with him. It’s to your 
advantage to avoid showing the other party what you really want; that way, 
you can bargain away something less important in exchange for something 
that you really need.
Suspending judgment
The main thing you need to do — and persuade others to do — is postpone 
all decisions about what positions to take and who’s right or wrong. This 

228
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
technique is called suspending judgment, and it means holding off from 
resolving the conflict (or fighting about it) long enough to do some good 
problem-solving and research and to engage your creative intelligence.
 
You can postpone resolving almost any conflict for another day or week to 
give yourself time to think. Deciding is all well and good, but thinking is even 
better and ought to be done first!
Facilitating brainstorming when 
participants are hostile
In Chapters 6 and 7, I review ways to facilitate brainstorming sessions. The 
same techniques and approaches work in any situation in which you want 
to generate alternatives, including conflicts. Sometimes, however, a conflict 
makes for more hostility and less buy-in than you have in a normal brain-
storming session. To push forward and get some helpful creative thinking in 
spite of resistance, try these tips:
 
✓ Offer creative ideas of your own — as many of them as you can. You 
can’t count on other people to participate as fully as you’d like them to, 
so come to the table with plenty of fresh ideas to get the creative process 
under way.
 
✓ Be firm about the rules of brainstorming. Don’t permit criticism of 
ideas (see “Suspending judgment,” earlier in this chapter, for ways to 
apply this rule to conflicts), and require everyone to build on ideas — 
even if those ideas were first suggested by the other side in the conflict.
 
✓ Be optimistic! Point out that there’s always a chance of finding a clever 
new approach that benefits all parties, and if you fail to do so, you can 
simply go back to resolving the conflict the old-fashioned way by 
bargaining or compromising, so there’s really nothing to lose by trying 
to find a creative new approach that offers more for everyone.
Identifying and Refining Win–Win Ideas
A win–win idea gives both sides of a conflict the feeling that they’ve won 
because they get more than they expected to.
A classic story about negotiating illustrates this point. Two sisters were arguing 
over the last orange in their kitchen. Their mother asked them what they 
wanted it for. One sister said she was going to bake a cake, and the recipe 
called for grated orange rind; the other said she wanted to eat the fruit. The 
mother laughed. The sisters didn’t need to argue, because they wanted different 
parts of the orange. They simply needed to communicate more clearly.

229
 Chapter 13: Negotiating Creative Win–Wins
 
Not all disputes have win–win solutions as simple as the one concerning the 
orange, but many do have possible win–win solutions. I know a woman who 
moved her popular retail store to a new and better location in the center of an 
old New England town. What she didn’t realize before the move was that the 
town has tight specifications for store signs. The large sign she had used at 
her old location was rejected by the town hall, and she was unhappy about 
the prospect of having to use a much smaller, less conspicuous sign. I 
suggested that she set up a meeting with the person responsible for the 
decision and approach the discussion in a collaborative way rather than as an 
opportunity to vent her anger. She met with the powers that be and asked for 
help in coming up with some alternatives that would meet her goal of making 
her store name visible while also meeting the town’s regulations. They were 
able to come up with an alternative that was a win for both sides. Everyone 
was happy, and nobody had to call their lawyer!
Agreeing that some ideas 
hold significant promise
When you reframe a conflict as an opportunity to innovate so as to meet 
everyone’s needs better, you can begin to generate ideas. The ideas may be 
sketchy or flawed at first, because that’s the nature of ideas, but it’s important 
to focus on the merits of the first batch of ideas. Talk about the things you 
like in each proposal or suggestion, and overlook (for now) the bad points. 
Encourage the other side to identify the strengths of specific ideas, too. 
This positive focus helps make people feel safe about proposing more ideas, 
and it also tells you what each side wants to build on as you try to refine or 
improve on the initial ideas.
Working the top three ideas 
until one emerges as best
When you’ve got a good number of ideas and suggestions — at least a dozen — 
ask the other side to identify the three strongest ones. See whether you 
can find enough positive things about those three items to make them your 
top three too. If not, put forward your own favorite suggestions, and start 
another round of brainstorming to find a way to combine the best elements 
of both sides’ favorite proposals.
Generally, you’ll find that with enough discussion and thinking, an obvious 
best option will emerge, and both sides can endorse it happily.

Chapter 14
Innovating to Save Costs
In This Chapter
▶ Maintaining a spirit of innovation when times are tough and costs must be cut
▶ Identifying the biggest expenses and chipping away at them first
▶ Seeing what others have done to cut costs
▶ Implementing cost savings with care
C
ost-cutting is a necessary evil that comes to the forefront periodically — 
either because of a down economy or because of some challenge that’s 
more specific to your organization, such as the loss of a major customer or 
contract. It would be nice if every business grew at a predictable rate and 
spending never got ahead of income, but the reality is that every business 
has to go through the cost-cutting wringer now and then.
If you take a creative approach to saving costs, you can often minimize the 
damage and sometimes even turn things around with clever ideas that save 
costs and help revive your future prospects. The call for cost cuts should be 
a call for creative thinking, not just mindless hacking at the budget.
Avoiding the Creative Frost Effect
When times are good and the budget is growing, everybody thinks that inno-
vation is a great idea. All it takes is a little bad news for people to circle the 
mental wagons and put a chill on the creative spirit. For a long time, I didn’t 
understand the paradox of turning away from innovation in tough times, 
when creative thinking is needed most. Then I heard about the psychology of 
innovation, and it all made sense.
The psychological factor that drives innovation in workplaces is called 
creative self-efficacy, or employees’ beliefs that they can be creative in their 
work roles. I prefer to call it creative determination, which is a clearer, easier-
to-remember name.
In innovative organizations, employees’ creative determination is always 
high. Unfortunately, the changes that come along with falling sales and 

232
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
tighter budgets tend to make people feel that their ideas aren’t wanted. They 
begin to lose their feeling of creative determination. They get the message 
that it’s not a good time to suggest new things because there’s no time or 
money for new ideas. As a result, they stop thinking creatively and start feeling 
that there’s nothing to be done about the bad times except hope that their 
jobs aren’t cut before things turn around again.
Boosting creative determination
How can you avoid feeling that there’s no point in trying to be creative in 
bad times? Here are some things you can do for yourself (and, if you’re in a 
leadership position, for others) to combat the creative chill that comes with 
tight budgets and lean times:
 
✓ Find ways to say yes to some ideas instead of dismissing everything as 
being too expensive.
 
✓ Refocus creative thinking on ways of cutting costs, saving jobs, and 
reducing the effect of hard times.
 
✓ Encourage participation instead of closing down lines of communication 
with staff.
 
✓ Continue to plan for the future, even if you have to postpone many of 
the best plans until you have more funding for them.
 
✓ Talk about creative problem-solving, not just cost-cutting, so everybody 
knows that ideas are needed.
In tough times, it’s very common for management to lock staff out of the 
discussion on what to do. Managers have a practical reason for this autocratic 
style: They fear that they may need to cut hours or jobs and believe that 
they shouldn’t discuss those options with employees. That’s not necessarily 
true. Often, it’s better to lay the potential worst-case scenarios right out 
on the table and invite employees to help you try to come up with better 
approaches.
 
People feel better if they know the worst instead of wondering and guessing, 
and they like to feel that they have at least an outside chance of improving the 
situation by coming up with options and ideas. In workplaces in which 
employees are encouraged to brainstorm about ways to cut costs and respond 
to losses, morale is higher, and problem-solving is more creative and effective.
Avoiding pessimism about the future
One thing’s certain: If times are bad now, there’s a good chance that things will 
be better in the future. Good and bad times tend to alternate, so optimism is 
the most logical viewpoint when times are bad. Humans aren’t logical beings 

233
 Chapter 14: Innovating to Save Costs
all the time, of course, and our reactions to bad news are usually more emo-
tional than rational. Still, it’s a big help to remind yourself — and others — that 
it’s reasonable to expect things to get better in the future.
A pessimistic attitude makes you feel that you can’t do anything about the 
current problems. Nothing could be farther from the truth! A tough problem is a 
great opportunity for innovation (see Chapter 9 for details on problem-solving).
Before making any major cuts (such as cutting the payroll or closing facilities), 
take a day to assemble a team of your best and brightest employees or 
friends and associates, and ask them to brainstorm on this theme: Is there 
some way to solve our cash-flow problems by boosting revenue rather than 
making drastic cuts? Sometimes, you can find innovative ways of adding to 
the bottom line that make cost-cutting irrelevant.
 
An auto parts supplier was struggling with reduced wholesale business after a 
nearby dealership closed. In a brainstorming session, an employee who 
commuted from a distant town mentioned hearing that a supplier that served 
a neighboring region was closing. Upon further research, the rumor proved to 
be true, and the employees agreed to take turns making sales calls and work-
ing extra hours to expand into that neighboring territory. Within six months, 
the company had acquired several dozen additional customers — auto repair 
shops that ordered parts daily — and had a profitable new route for which it 
hired a new driver. No jobs were lost and one was gained through the use of a 
how-can-we-grow-revenue brainstorming session.
Trying a clean-slate approach
When it comes to saving money and cutting costs, it’s easy to get reactive and 
feel that it’s no time for highly creative thinking. Not so! If there’s ever a time to 
consider radical alternatives, this is it. Often, it takes a really fresh approach to 
make a big dent in costs, because the obvious has probably already been done.
How do you overcome the natural conservatism that creeps in when times 
are tough and budgets are tight? A great exercise is to gather a brainstorming 
group (see Chapter 6) and pose this challenge: “Imagine that our [fill in your 
system, process, product, facility, or piece of equipment] was destroyed last 
night, and we have to create a new one. You can design it however you like. 
Come up with the most economical and efficient design.” When group mem-
bers begin to imagine what a completely fresh new approach to design would 
be, they question old assumptions, eliminate inefficiencies, and generally 
come up with much better ideas and approaches.
Imagining that something has been destroyed overnight and has to be rede-
signed is just a hypothetical exercise; you probably won’t actually redesign 
from scratch. So why do the exercise? Often, it produces insights you can use 
right away for partial redesigns that produce significant savings.

234
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
 
Follow up on the first question by asking, “What ideas from this exercise can 
we apply to the actual process/product/facility?” It’s a good bet that the group 
will come up with at least one transferable idea.
Focusing on the Biggest Cost Categories
When managers think about ways of cutting costs, they usually focus on 
payroll, which upsets employees. Employees tend to see lots of other ways 
to save money and think that job cuts should be a last resort. The problem, 
however, is that payroll is a huge piece of the spending pie for most organiza-
tions. Managers are correct to focus on this big expense category, because 
it’s hard to save a lot of costs by cutting expenses for things that don’t con-
tribute much to the budget in the first place. There are more ways to take a 
bite out of costs than just announcing layoffs, however.
Identifying spending categories
 
A three-step process is helpful for identifying cost savings:
 
1. Target the five largest categories of spending.
 
2. Identify the three biggest subcategories within each of those major 
categories.
 
3. Solicit employee suggestions, ask suppliers to help, and run brain-
storming meetings for each of the subcategories.
These steps ensure that your creative energy is sharply focused where it can 
do the most good. A 1 percent reduction in a minor expense will hardly make 
a dent in your budget, but a 1 percent reduction in a major expense will be 
significant on the bottom line.
Here are some typical major spending categories (which vary from business 
to business, of course):
 
✓ Energy
 
✓ Facilities
 
✓ Health insurance and other employee benefits
 
✓ Inventories
 
✓ Maintenance
 
✓ Parts purchases
 
✓ Salaries
 
✓ Shipping

235
 Chapter 14: Innovating to Save Costs
 
✓ Telecommunications
 
✓ Travel
 
✓ Vehicles
 
✓ Water (a major expense for factories that use water in production)
It also helps to break down a broad category of costs by asking more specific 
questions about things that contribute to it.
 
A client of mine that designs and manufacturers fine furniture found that its 
energy costs were driven largely by three big expenses: air conditioning, lighting, 
and the drying room where products were sent after being painted. When a 
cost-savings team ran three separate brainstorming sessions focusing on each 
of these three areas of energy spending, it came up with significant innova-
tions to cut costs in all three areas:
 
✓ Install sheer white cloth in south-facing windows to reduce passive solar 
heating, and set thermostats 2 degrees higher (savings of 3 percent).
 
✓ Turn off every other overhead light fixture, and use spot lighting at the few 
workstations where bright light was really needed (savings of 2 percent).
 
✓ Switch to a faster-drying spray paint to reduce drying time by 50 percent 
(savings of 6 percent).
The combined savings from these three brainstorming sessions resulted in an 11 
percent cut in energy consumption at the facility — a major cost savings.
Take a look at your budget, rank your expense categories, and then ask 
pointed brainstorming questions about the biggest cost centers (see the next 
section). If you pose the question “How can we cut costs?” and ask employees 
to brainstorm answers, you’ll get a lot of answers about very small expenses, 
such as cutting spending on staples and sticky notes. Those suggestions may 
be useful, but you’ll get bigger savings if you start by analyzing your budget 
categories and then ask for ideas about how to save money in the three to 
five biggest categories first.
The furniture manufacturer that used a lot of energy for air conditioning, 
factory production, and lighting asked, “How can we cut our energy bill by 10 
percent or more?” To give employees a personal incentive to think about the 
question, management added the following note: “A savings of 10 percent of 
our energy costs will allow us to retain 20 jobs that would otherwise have 
to be cut.” A lot of good suggestions came in, and after those suggestions 
were implemented, the net savings was 11 percent. It pays to focus people’s 
creative attention on the biggest costs, because those costs are where you’ll 
realize the greatest savings in the shortest period.

236
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Focusing on major sources of 
error or rework
Mistakes are costly. Any errors or problems that recur are great opportunities 
to save money. Here are two examples of repetitive service and quality 
problems in organizations:
 
✓ A hotel sometimes overbooked its least-expensive rooms, forcing the 
front desk to give customers suites at a single-room rate.
 
✓ An eBay shipper got complaints about damaged shipments from 1 
percent to 2 percent of its customers, requiring it to offer refunds or 
replacement products.
In each case, the fact that the same problem occurred periodically meant 
that the organization had an opportunity to study the root causes and eliminate 
the most important ones. Any repeated error or mistake has many possible 
causes, but only a few of these causes will be responsible for the bulk of the 
problems. If you focus on eliminating one to three of the biggest causes of the 
error, you’ll make a big dent in the number of errors you see.
Learning from Others
There’s nothing new under the sun, as the old saying goes. That’s not entirely 
true, of course. A brilliant innovation is a powerful asset specifically because 
it is “new under the sun” and can be patented and protected as it’s commer-
cialized. When it comes to cost savings, however, there probably is some-
thing old that you can try, which is why it’s particularly important to look 
around for approaches that have worked elsewhere.
Sending out your scouts
As an advance assignment for a cost-cutting meeting or brainstorming session, 
ask everyone who’ll be attending to gather at least ten examples of cost-cutting 
from other organizations. Then spend the first half hour or more of your meeting 
sharing the examples that everyone found. To facilitate this round of sharing, 
stand at a whiteboard or chart pad headed “Take-Away Ideas,” and make note 
of anything that the group thinks might be useful in your organization.
At this point, keep the discussion fairly brief; just note the main idea and any 
simple added points about how or where to apply it. Later in the meeting, 
you can ask the group — or small breakout teams of three or four people, if 
the group is larger than a dozen — to brainstorm specific action plans based 
on the ideas you jotted down. If the group uses a reported idea as a 

237
 Chapter 14: Innovating to Save Costs
springboard and comes up with a better or more appropriate idea of its own, 
that’s great! You don’t have to do exactly what others have done, but you 
certainly should try to use their approaches for inspiration.
Reviewing examples of cost-cutting 
measures elsewhere
How have other organizations cut costs and saved materials or energy? Here 
are some examples that I’ve seen in cost-cutting exercises:
 
✓ Periodically send requests (via e-mail and craigslist) to businesses that 
are moving, asking whether they’re discarding some of their furniture 
or equipment and would like for you to take it away. This technique is 
a great way to get furniture, fixtures, and equipment for free!
 
✓ Use college and business-school interns for lower-level work. They 
need the résumé-building experience, and you need free (or almost-free) 
labor. It’s a classic win–win situation.
 
✓ Call or visit all your suppliers to ask what they can do to cut their 
prices. It’s surprising how often you can negotiate a better price or rate 
just by showing up and asking.
 
✓ Try to reduce the number of suppliers you buy from in exchange for 
deeper discounts and more service from the remaining ones. Shift 
business away from the suppliers that balk at offering deeper discounts 
and toward the ones that meet your pricing needs.
 
✓ Consider purchasing basic supplies in bulk and storing a larger 
supply. If you can bypass your regular supplier and go directly to a large 
manufacturer, you may achieve enough savings to make it worthwhile to 
hold inventory (but check with your regular supplier first to see if it will 
match the savings).
 
✓ Form or join a buying cooperative in which smaller businesses pool 
their purchases, thereby gaining access to volume discounts and more 
negotiating power with suppliers.
 
✓ Share space with one or more other businesses. Lease or sublet several 
of your offices to lawyers and accountants, for example, and double up 
in the remaining offices.
 
✓ Ask your landlord for a rent reduction. If the market is soft in your 
area, and you’ve been a good tenant, the landlord may be willing to 
reconsider the rent rather than lose you.
 
✓ If your business has many local competitors, watch for ones that go 
out of business, and acquire their phone numbers from them. You’ll 
get some of their repeat business when customers call the old phone 
number to place an order. It’s a remarkably inexpensive and effective 
way to find new customers!

238
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
 
✓ Use telecommuters to do self-managed jobs such as Web design, engi-
neering, and writing. If you have people come in only half-time, you can 
reduce the number of offices you provide by half!
 
✓ Outsource functions that are generic, including basic payroll, account-
ing, and data entry. Consult Outsourcing For Dummies, by Ed Ashley 
(Wiley), for more on how to use this cost-saving strategy.
 
✓ Check your rates for credit card transactions and online merchant 
banking, and shop around for better rates.
 
✓ Identify inventories that aren’t turning over, and ask the suppliers 
to take back some of these supplies or products at cost. Getting these 
materials off your books will put cash back into your account.
 
✓ Cut your inventories by working with suppliers that can guarantee 
quick, reliable delivery so that you don’t have to worry about running 
out. Inventories are a major hidden cost center in many businesses.
 
✓ Save ink and toner in your printers by being more concise and by 
using smaller fonts that use less ink. Thin, unadorned fonts like Arial 
and Lucida use slightly less ink than traditional fonts do. New typefaces 
such as Ecofont use the least possible ink to make a clearly legible letter. 
My favorite, however, is Arial Narrow, which uses less ink and, by com-
pressing the letters slightly, also saves paper.
 
✓ Increase your scale. Economies of scale are the savings you achieve 
when you produce and sell more, because some of your costs (such as 
rent and payroll) are fixed and don’t go up when you do more business. 
Consider giving away more samples and offering to supply prospective 
customers for free for a month, just to get your volume up. You may be 
able to outgrow your cost constraints!
 
✓ Limit telephone use. Telephone conversations are important for cus-
tomer service, sales, and problem-solving, but employees probably over-
use the phones for other purposes. Switch to using e-mail as much as 
possible. It’s faster and far cheaper than talking.
 
✓ Turn the thermometer up and down. If you relax the dress code enough 
that people can layer up or layer down for the weather, you can allow 
the office temperature to fluctuate more with the ambient temperature. 
Allowing a seasonal temperature range of 12 degrees Fahrenheit can 
save you 10 percent to 15 percent of your annual heating and air 
conditioning costs.
Do these cost-saving ideas get you thinking? I find that if I seed a cost-cutting 
session with some ideas from earlier brainstorms, the new group gets up to 
speed and produces helpful suggestions much more quickly and easily.

239
 Chapter 14: Innovating to Save Costs
Asking around
It’s amazing how happy people are to talk about their own accomplishments. 
To find out what other companies are doing to save costs, try asking people 
who work at other companies. If they’ve been involved in the cost-cutting 
effort, they’ll be excited to share their results with you.
 
A great way to find people to ask for cost-saving techniques is to go to industry 
events, such as a chamber-of-commerce luncheon or a regional conference for 
your industry or profession. One doctor I know went to a two-day conference 
about medical diagnostics, and while she was there, she asked other doctors 
from primary-care practices what they were doing to cut their costs. She came 
back with dozens of ideas to try in her own medical practice.
Using Savings-Creation Methods from 
Idea to Implementation
Savings creation is what I call the special toolbox of cost-cutting-oriented 
brainstorming, idea review, and implementation of methods that individuals 
and groups can use to reduce the budget and make ends meet. This section 
contains some of my favorites.
Finding out where the losses really are
It’s easy to see if your overall budget is in the red, but it’s far harder to know 
exactly where those losses come from. Cost accounting involves the allocation 
of various costs to specific products or processes, and it’s a tricky thing to 
do well. Sometimes, the allocation formulas used in your accounting system 
are inaccurate and don’t tell you where you’re really losing and making 
money. Take some time to examine your accounting, and research how costs 
are — and should be — allocated. You may find that a location, route, product, 
or process is less profitable in fact than it looks on paper, while another is more 
profitable. Your cost-accounting research will help you make the right cuts.
 
I worked with a freight transportation company to identify which of its hundreds 
of trucking routes were making and losing money. With the help of some 
expert accountants, I discovered that some of the company’s figures were off 
and that certain routes were losing more money than anyone realized. When 
we improved the cost accounting, it became obvious that certain routes 
needed to be cut and others needed to be priced higher to make the overall 
operation more profitable.

240
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Generating effective cost-cutting ideas
Set the tone for a cost-reduction brainstorm by emphasizing the shared 
benefits and encouraging people not to be defensive or protective of their 
own turf. Point out that it’s better to cut costs in your own area or department 
than to have others do it, because you have more creative control by making 
the cuts yourself and can minimize the negative effects. Build buy-in by 
discussing the benefits of a participatory approach to cost-cutting versus a 
top-down one.
Focus the brainstorming on the biggest cost categories so as to generate 
ideas with the biggest possible effect (see “Identifying spending categories,” 
earlier in this chapter, for details).
Encourage creativity! People get very serious and conservative when it 
comes to cost-cutting, and they overlook the more innovative approaches. 
Point out to the group that simple cost-cutting is a win–lose equation: All it 
does is save money by taking things away. By getting creative and making 
innovative changes in the way you do business, you can shift from win–lose 
(winning cost savings by losing something that you used to have) to a win–
win approach, in which changing how you do things produces a cost savings 
without a corresponding loss.
All the innovative brainstorming methods that I cover in Part II are fully 
applicable to cost-cutting and can help you produce innovative ideas that 
turn the problem of a tight budget into an opportunity to find new and better 
ways to operate.
 
When you hold a cost-cutting brainstorm, I recommend starting with a review of 
really successful cost cuts (ones in which an innovation helped cut costs while 
improving the way that the business works). A few inspiring examples will help 
show the team what you mean by win–win innovations (see “Reviewing 
examples of cost-cutting measures elsewhere,” earlier in this chapter).
When your group runs out of ideas (as it will after the first hour or so), start 
another round of ideas by challenging them to think about ways to
 
✓ Pool resources with others.
 
✓ Reduce steps in business processes.
 
✓ Switch to less-expensive alternatives.
 
✓ Be more flexible about time or place.
 
✓ Get rid of anything that isn’t used frequently.
 
✓ Get rid of lines of business that don’t make a profit.
 
✓ Outsource more services and functions.

241
 Chapter 14: Innovating to Save Costs
These seven general strategies are extremely powerful and can produce 
substantial cost savings. If you can come up with even one idea worth imple-
menting in each of these categories, you’ll cut costs substantially — perhaps 
by as much as 25 percent to 30 percent.
Evaluating cost-cutting proposals
When you’ve got a good list of possible ways of cutting costs, evaluate each 
one by using three criteria:
 
✓ How much will the cut save? Assigning a financial value helps you 
decide which ones should be implemented first.
 
✓ What problems will the cut create? Some cost-saving ideas are 
relatively pain free, but others cause inconveniences or may even make 
other costs rise. Consider the effect before implementing any idea.
 
✓ How will the cut affect quality? Make sure that you’re not undercutting 
your product or service quality with the cost reduction; otherwise, the 
cut will come back to haunt you in the form of falling sales.
These three criteria give you a quick initial screening. After that screening, 
you can further analyze the ideas or proposals that look best based on these 
questions:
 
✓ How long will it take to implement the idea and see real savings from 
it? If it takes too long, you may do better to focus on something that has 
a quicker payoff.
 
✓ Do we have the expertise and time to implement the idea now? Avoid 
proposals that require expensive extra effort or hired expertise.
 
✓ Is the proposal focusing on a function, division, product, or location 
that loses so much money that we may simply want to shut it down? 
There’s no point in making minor cuts in something that’s a candidate 
for elimination; you may as well make the big cut right away.
Implementing cost savings
Implementing cost savings is not very different from implementing any 
innovation, but some things about cost savings differ. Cost savings can easily 
feel like a loss, for example, producing pushback and resistance. Also, 
businesses are complex systems in which everything is interconnected, so 
it’s not always easy to predict the effects of cost cuts (see “Observing the 
consequences,” later in this chapter). Following are some tips to help you 
implement your creative cost savings.

242
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Informing those who will be most affected
When someone imposes cost savings on you, it doesn’t feel so good. The 
results may include irritation, resistance, and possible sabotage of the program. 
If you don’t see any good way to make the design of the cost-saving project 
participative, impose it hard and fast, pushing through the resistance as 
quickly as possible and with such a firm hand that employees quickly accept 
it as the new reality. Fast implementation will hasten acceptance. Also make 
sure that you inform those affected by the cuts fully and clearly. Tell them 
exactly how they will be affected so they won’t be left wondering and listening 
to rumors.
A brainstorming process is a good opportunity to include people who may be 
affected. Invite representatives to participate in the idea-generation process. 
Include everyone in your progress reports. Make the creative cost-saving 
effort more transparent to reduce resistance.
When you select a cost-saving idea, pull together a small, action-oriented 
design team to decide exactly how to implement it. This design team 
should include representatives from the main groups that will be affected. 
Participation really does help ease the transition.
 
As you choose people to include in the design team, make sure that you avoid 
including anyone who is negative and obviously will resist change. Some 
people don’t think innovatively, and they aren’t going to be helpful in your 
cost-saving process. Let them grumble from the sidelines — but don’t let them 
have a turn at bat. Keep the project in the hands of people who have a 
reasonable amount of creative determination and believe that they can 
improve things through innovative behavior.
Observing the consequences
Often, it’s not the quality of the cost-saving idea itself but the quality of the 
implementation that determines whether you succeed or fail.
The biggest problem that most cost-saving plans run into is unintended 
consequences — outcomes that weren’t part of the original plan. Unintended 
consequences can be good or bad, actually, but the bad ones are the ones to 
watch out for. Here are the three main types of unintended consequences:
 
✓ Positive unexpected benefits, such as greater savings than anticipated 
(also called windfalls): Sometimes, the implementation goes more 
smoothly than expected and creates big, immediate cost savings as well 
as goodwill for future cost-saving efforts. I like to implement easy, posi-
tive cost savings before tackling harder ones in the hope of building 
positive moral and momentum — an intended unintended consequence.
 
✓ Negative side effects, such as a drop in productivity as an unintended 
result of cuts in payroll: Like medicines, cost cuts often have side 
effects. Try to anticipate them by brainstorming a list of possible side 
effects in advance and then building as many safeguards into your plan 

243
 Chapter 14: Innovating to Save Costs
as possible. If you see significant side effects after implementation, track 
their financial effect, and subtract that sum from the gains to calculate 
the net cost savings. If the outcome isn’t positive, scrap the plan and try 
something else.
 
✓ Perverse effects, or opposite results from what was expected: Historians 
speculate that the Treaty of Versailles, which was intended to create peace 
in Europe, might actually have caused World War II by imposing humiliating 
conditions on Germany. Oops. When human behavior is involved in a cost-
saving plan, watch out for perverse effects. If you create a perceived 
shortage of something, people may hoard it.
 
 I recall one company in which an effort to ration basic office supplies 
such as paper, tape, and sticky notes produced hoarding. Some people 
hid large quantities of office supplies in their desks and file cabinets, and 
one woman actually took home cases of supplies in a misguided effort to 
ensure that her department would not run out. The purchasing depart-
ment was forced to purchase more to supply those who hadn’t hoarded.
As you implement cost-saving plans, follow through with a checkup every week 
to see whether the effects are positive or at least that the positive effects out-
weigh any negative ones. Around one in five cost-saving plans has to be revised 
during implementation. “Learn as you go” is a good rule for cost savings.
Filing weekly progress reports
Cost-saving initiatives aren’t part of the normal business routine; they’re 
special efforts that tend to come in waves when the situation requires belt-
tightening. Because cost-saving initiatives are outside the regular work of the 
business, they tend not to be tracked or accounted for very rigorously, which 
means that they may not be completed as thoroughly as they should be.
To ensure follow-through and successful completion, keep central records 
on each and every cost-saving initiative. Give each one a unique name or 
numerical code, note the start date, identify the people who are responsible 
for implementation, and log their progress reports. A paper-based system in 
a file cabinet is fine unless you use project management software, in which 
case you should take advantage of the central management capabilities of 
your program.
Have each cost-saving team report in every week to make sure that no 
projects fall though the cracks. Also, collect details on what’s done and how 
much is saved.
Asking teams to document what they learned
At the end of each project, ask the implementation team to write a short 
lessons-learned memo to document any insights they gained, including 
insights about how to control costs (which might include further suggestions) 
and how to manage cost-control projects in the future.

244
Part III: Applying Creativity and Innovation to Daily Challenges 
Documentation allows you to learn from the experience and also to ensure 
accountability. If something seemed like a good idea upfront, you want a 
system that ensures that the idea actually gets implemented. Many cost-
saving ideas require change and accommodation, so there will be some 
resistance to them. Centrally tracking and managing all cost-saving projects 
shows everyone that the projects matter and that management is watching 
their progress. That’s your best way to ensure follow-through.

our ideas deserve proper implementation because 
without good implementation, they may not succeed. 
Implementing something well means getting people 
excited about your ideas and plans and helping them figure 
out how to use your new methods or inventions. Most 
good ideas fail to get implemented, so take this step 
seriously and budget some time and effort to making 
sure your ideas come to fruition.
In this part, you get help with building networks, teams,

M
y fifth child was born a week before I wrote this chapter — a healthy 
girl named Eisa — and as the family gathered to greet her, someone 
pointed out that her lips were chapped. “Blisters,” my wife corrected. “From 
nursing.” Indeed, new babies get blisters on their lips, and it seems like you 
ought to do something for them, but nobody sells a product for the purpose. 
My eldest son, Eliot, said, “Why doesn’t somebody sell a product called Baby 
Balm?” Why not? My wife, Deedee, pointed out that natural lanolin might be a 
safe product to use. Within a few minutes, we had identified a need, coined a 
catchy brand name for a product, and decided what to make it of. Great!
But we still haven’t marketed Baby Balm because manufacturing and selling 
it aren’t as simple as imagining it, and I doubt that we ever will. I’m an author 
and consultant, not a manufacturer, so it’s not a great match with my busi-
ness. If it were, though, I’d need to formulate and test the product, obtain 
approval to sell it from any relevant regulatory authorities, select a contrac-
tor to manufacture it, design an appealing and functional package, line up 
retail distributors, and launch it with an effective marketing campaign. As 
with most innovations, there would be many steps involved in implementing 
our idea.
This chapter addresses the tough challenge of implementing an innovation, 
whether it’s a new product, process, or any other design or idea. Studies 
show that more innovations fail because of poor implementation than 
because of bad ideas. Protect your good idea from failure by implementing it 
carefully and well!

248
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Planning the Innovation Process
You need to understand a process to manage it, which means deciding on 
the likely length of your innovation process, the stages it will go through, and 
the results you expect at each stage. Create a simple plan of action containing 
steps, a timeline, and some measures of performance. Hand out copies, 
and post one of the copies prominently in your workspace. This document, 
simple as it is, will guide you through the innovation process and let you 
know when your team slips off track.
Some of the biggest and most successful innovative organizations use a 
general innovation process as a template to help them plan each project. 
(For a good example, see Procter & Gamble’s innovation process in the section 
“Emphasizing planning, preparation, and refinement,” later in this chapter.) 
If you do a Web search for “innovation process,” you’ll find dozens of results, 
some of them for processes with just a handful of steps, others more elaborate 
and complex. Which is correct? None, actually, because none was developed 
specifically for your organization and process.
You’ll need to adapt a generic multiple-step innovation process for your 
particular project, adding or modifying the steps until they capture everything 
that you think you’ll need to do to achieve success. As a starting point, use 
the generic innovation process shown in Figure 15-1, an all-around model that 
captures the main management stages of almost every innovation process. 
Don’t stop there, though. Add detailed substeps within each of the four main 
stages to customize it to your specific project.

 Chapter 15: Managing the Development of an Innovative Idea
Figure 15-1 shows Hiam’s Innovation Cycle. Yup, this is the way I draw the 
innovation process for my students and clients. I symbolize innovation with 
an outline of the human hand, because human hands, with their opposable 
digits, give us the capacity to make tools and build things with them, thereby 
making us the innovators on our planet.
The figure also shows innovation as a cycle, not as a linear process. The idea 
is that the end of one process should lead to the beginning of another. Don’t 
stop innovating just because you have a success. Use the momentum from 
that success to start another project.
In addition to planning the process stage by stage, you need to keep a close 
eye on progress, and be prepared to respond and adjust when things go 
wrong. What can go wrong will go wrong, as the old saying goes, so you 
need to anticipate possible problems and have contingency plans in place. 
Knowing the common hazards of implementation prepares you to navigate 
them. The following sections examine the six things you must do to control 
the most common sources of trouble.
Being flexible about the design
For starters, you may find that your idea, design, or invention doesn’t work 
as well as — or in the way that — you expected. Design problems and 
unintended consequences are common, but they need not derail your project 
entirely. The trick is to assess and evaluate continually so that you can catch 
flaws in your design while there’s still time to correct them.
 
Learning as you go is the secret to good implementation. Don’t be pigheaded 
and insist on sticking to the original plan if it’s not working as planned. Stop, 
rethink, and revise.
Clarifying the goal
Poor goal definition is a big cause of implementation disasters. Ask yourself 
exactly what you’re trying to accomplish, by what date, and how you’ll measure 
success and failure. Develop a detailed written statement of your objectives, 
along with measures or indicators of success. Break success into waypoints or 
check-ins along the way so that you’ll know whether you’re on track and won’t 
have to wait until the very end to find out that you have a mess.
Clear goals add the discipline you need to make your implementation run 
smoothly; they keep you focused and moving in one clear direction. Without 
clear goals, nobody knows just what he should be doing, and often, people 
work against one another by trying to move the innovation in their own 
competing directions.

250
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Communicating early, often, and widely
Make sure that you communicate regularly with everyone who may be important 
to the implementation, because poor communication derails a lot of innova-
tions. Spread information about the innovation, including progress reports, 
expected effects, and what help you’ll need at each stage.
 
Keep in close touch with anyone who controls information that you and your 
implementation team may need. A good rule of thumb is to talk every week to 
every person who might be important to the project.
Emphasizing long-term benefits
When people feel that they need to pursue their immediate interests, they 
often get in the way of implementation by resisting change. It’s important to 
keep them talking and thinking about longer-term benefits. In the long run, 
every employee and department is part of the overall organization, and an 
innovation that’s good for the organization can be good for every member of 
it. The big-picture idea is that a rising tide lifts all boats. Watch out for knee-
jerk, defensive, short-term reactions, and try to keep the dialogue focused on 
the medium distance rather than the immediate.
Monitoring the results
Poor monitoring of results is a big factor in many failures. Make sure that you 
have regular progress reviews, either in person or through detailed written 
reports followed by phone conversations to review them (if it’s not feasible 
to meet in person).
 
After you choose your criteria for evaluating success, stick with them! Often, 
people get so committed to the idea of succeeding that they let their stan-
dards slip, and they refuse to fail an innovation when it doesn’t meet bench-
mark measures. It’s great to be emotionally committed, because commitment 
means that you’ll work hard and be a creative, persistent problem-solver, but 
try not to let your commitment cloud your judgment. Sometimes, you simply 
have to pull the plug and admit that the plan didn’t work out as expected. 
Persisting beyond reasonable evidence of success is just plain foolish, and 
tight monitoring of results can prevent it.
Building strong implementation teams
Implementation almost always takes a group of people to make it happen. But 
as you probably know from your own (perhaps painful) experience, teams 

251
 Chapter 15: Managing the Development of an Innovative Idea
don’t always work smoothly and well. Some teams have a real shortage of team-
work because managers don’t build teamwork simply by telling people that they 
belong to a team. You have to provide a sense of unity and shared purpose.
Teams need to be established and managed over the life cycle of the implemen-
tation process. See the next section for details on making your teams tick.
Innovating in Teams
The lone inventor may be a heroic figure in common folklore, but in fact, almost 
all innovations are developed by teams. Sometimes, an existing — and well-
functioning — team already exists and can simply take the new idea and run with 
it. More often, you have to form an appropriate team and manage its develop-
ment at the same time that you manage the development of your innovation.
Maintaining momentum through 
the four stages of the team’s life
Here are the stages of team development:
 
1. Charter the team.
 
 Identify the need, obtain authorization, and invite members.
 
2. Build the team.
 
 Create momentum through purposeful goals. Your team members will 
be motivated by exciting goals and will feel eager and enthusiastic to 
achieve them.
 
3. Structure the work.
 
 Establish work assignments, plans, and milestones.
 
4. Finish the work.
 
 Iron out any problems, and make sure that the innovation is functioning 
properly at full scale.
Unfortunately, developing and managing a team is a separate duty from man-
aging the development of an innovation. Teams are chartered and managed 
for many purposes, not just for innovating, and whenever you have a project 
team, you need to manage it through these four stages. To manage the team 
through all its stages, you need to form it with an eye to the diverse member-
ship that will make it productive in every stage.

252
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Tapping into diverse contributions 
by team members
Different people bring different strengths to a team. After all, that’s the big idea 
behind teamwork, isn’t it? As you charter your team, try to anticipate the various 
strengths and skills you may need, and seek team members who cover all your 
needs — including those with sufficient authority to access needed resources.
 
Round out your team with people who are dissimilar. Diversity adds initial 
complications as you work to unify your team and build strong morale, but as 
soon as you get the team up and running, that same diversity becomes a 
tremendous asset that gives the team a wide range of perspectives to tap into.
In addition to the normal range of human differences — experience, expertise, 
background, and so on — you need to have a range of creative styles. 
Different creative styles ensure that you have people who are good at the 
four main types of tasks that a project team has to perform:
 
✓ Exploring: Creative thinking, questioning, probing, and provoking
 
✓ Energizing: Motivating, engaging, encouraging, and supporting
 
✓ Structuring: Organizing, planning, tracking, and evaluating
 
✓ Finishing: Completing, checking, transitioning, and terminating
Human nature being what it is, most people are good at only one or two of 
these roles. The trick is making sure that your team has a range of people, 
each of them naturally good at one of the four roles. Including all four roles 
is the most important thing to think about in team building, aside from the 
inclusion of people who have appropriate expertise and authority.
 
The Team Roles Analysis assessment instrument (see www.tspectrum.com/
team_roles.htm for ordering information or www.supportforinnovation.
com for a summary) predicts team role behavior quite accurately, based on the 
simple insight that creativity and extraversion combine to determine how people 
behave on project teams. For example, someone who is open to creativity and 
also extroverted has the temperament of an Energizer. The following list shows 
how each role is based on these two dimensions of personality:
 
✓ Social-creatives are extraverted and creative, and perform the Energizer 
role with ease.
 
✓ Individual-creatives are introverted and creative, and make natural 
Explorers.
 
✓ Social-logicals are extraverted and analytical, so they find it easy to 
Organize the work of others.
 
✓ Individual-logicals are introverted and analytical, and make great Finishers 
because they stay on task and aren’t happy until the goal is achieved.

253
 Chapter 15: Managing the Development of an Innovative Idea
As you form your team, think about what expertise you’ll need, what authorities 
might be helpful, and how to cover all four of the team roles by including 
people who fit these four descriptions.
If you know the people in question and have worked with them before, it 
will be obvious who is creative or analytical and who is social or individual. 
(If not, give candidates a Team Roles Analysis assessment as part of their 
screening.) Look for all four combinations of these traits. If you’re lacking a 
role on your team, recruit someone to fill it, even if that person lacks specific 
expertise in the project, because the project won’t get finished unless you 
have all four roles represented on your team. (Don’t say I didn’t warn you.)
Finding your strongest team role
Are you a creative Explorer who’s great at imagining things in the early 
stages of a project and can provide the vision and creativity to bring the 
team’s work to life?
Are you an Organizer who excels at planning, coordinating, and tracking the 
work of team members?
Are you an Energizer who enjoys communicating with team members, and 
brings enthusiasm and excitement to the team and its mission?
Are you a Finisher who’s focused on the ultimate goal and won’t be happy 
until it’s achieved?
A team needs all four of these roles. Sometimes, one person can cover more 
than one role, but often, it works best to let different people play different 
roles. Knowing your own strongest role (from experience or by taking the 
Team Roles Analysis questionnaire; refer to the preceding section) will 
help you see how to contribute to the interpersonal dynamics of the team. 
Whether you’re the team leader or one of the team members, you ought to 
step to the forefront when your strongest role is needed.
Self-awareness of your strengths is important to good team contributions. 
Bring your technical expertise and your personal strengths to the team by 
understanding what you have to offer and then talking to the team about 
what you can contribute. Get the others to think and talk about their 
strongest contributions, too. A team is greater than the sum of its parts if — 
and only if — all members share their greatest strengths, not their greatest 
weaknesses!

Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Determining what the team 
leader needs to do
To succeed as team leader, you need to ask yourself a simple question each 
day: “What does my team need to succeed?” Then make sure that the team 
gets what it needs to the greatest extent possible. Whatever the team’s needs 
are — tangible resources, technical help, or intangible things like encouragement 
and optimism — you’re responsible for helping the team get those things so 
that it can keep working productively and well.
To assess your team’s ongoing (and often changing) needs, ask yourself 
whether you need to do work for your team in any of the following seven 
areas, which come from my Team Leadership Inventory (published by 
Trainer’s Spectrum at www.tspectrum.com):
 
✓ Team formation and maintenance: Establish and cultivate the team, 
such as by holding a morale-building celebration of progress.
 
✓ Boundary management: Manage the barriers to teamwork, such as by 
intervening with a team member’s department head to get permission 
for her to attend more of the team meetings.
 
✓ External communications: Make sure that the team communicates fully 
throughout the organization and with innovation partners beyond your 
organization.
 
✓ Internal communications: Encourage the team members to commu-
nicate openly and freely with one another, such as by holding regular 
progress briefings.
 
✓ Team vision: Make sure that the team understands and stays focused on 
its main mission.
 
✓ Performance management: Keep team members on track through clear 
assignments and progress check-ins.
 
✓ Member and leader development: Seek new information, and build skills.
Use these seven team needs as a checklist for reviewing your team’s status, and 
put effort into any of them that seem to be lacking. A deficit in internal commu-
nications, for example, can derail a project quickly. Many implementation efforts 
fail because the team doesn’t function well, not because of any fundamental flaw 
in the innovation itself. Don’t let team dysfunction ruin your innovation!
Considering a skunkworks to protect 
your team from interference
Sometimes, a development effort is so intense and difficult that a normal 
team can’t do it, and you need to create a super team with a high degree of 

255
 Chapter 15: Managing the Development of an Innovative Idea
focus and intensity. If the level of difficulty and effort is much higher for your 
project than it is for regular work in your organization, you may need to isolate 
your team to maintain a level of exceptional performance. Set up a highly 
protected, innovative team in an isolated area for those really challenging 
projects that ordinary teams can’t accomplish.
Skunkworks are development or implementation projects that are handled by a 
team with a secret agenda working in isolation from the rest of the organization.
The term is used generically by many people in business. The term Skunk 
Works, however, is actually protected as a trademark by the aerospace company 
Lockheed Martin Corp., where the term was first coined, so if you’re a 
consultant who wants to offer services for setting up such teams, you’d 
better find your own name. Lockheed Martin’s first Skunk Works team, 
established in 1943, developed the P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter in 
record time under the pressure of wartime needs. If you’re working on 
a new jet fighter, you should follow all 14 of the official Lockheed Martin 
Skunk Works rules at www.lockheedmartin.com/aeronautics/
skunkworks/14rules.html.
For a less-intensive (and secretive) project for general business purposes, 
the spirit of the approach is pretty well captured by these guidelines:
 
✓ Give the team leader considerable control and autonomy.
 
✓ Give the team an ambitious goal and plenty of resources to pursue it.
 
✓ Define clear specifications for the outcome so that the team knows 
exactly what it’s supposed to produce.
 
✓ Let the team work intensively and without interruption.
 
✓ Minimize outside communication to prevent criticism and negative 
thinking.
A highly autonomous, isolated team working in secrecy isn’t a good idea 
for most innovation efforts, but it may be helpful if you have a self-sufficient 
group of experts who are highly motivated to do something that’s so out of 
the ordinary that it would be difficult to do in the regular work environment.
As for keeping the work secret, unless you’re working under security 
restrictions (as Lockheed Martin often does under military contract), the 
only practical contribution of secrecy is to reduce external criticism and 
prevent outsiders from holding you up by restricting your resources. If the 
team emerges from isolation with a well-developed invention that’s ready to 
use, resistance may never be an issue, and the rest of the organization may 
embrace the work.
If the invention requires adaptation on the part of other people, however, 
it might be wise to give them detailed briefings early in the project, rather 
than spring the results on them later as an unpleasant surprise. Secrecy is a 

256
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
double-edged sword: It gives the project team a greater sense of safety and 
unity, but it also slows the recruitment of partners and the spread of infor-
mation during implementation. Because of these negative consequences, 
skunkworks teams aren’t advisable for most innovations, but they’re great 
for innovating in an intensely creative, driven manner within a less-creative 
larger organization.
Building Development and 
Implementation Networks
A strong development team is a powerful thing, but it may not be sufficient 
to get your innovation all the way off the ground. Often, you need resources 
outside your team — resources that you can’t really afford to bring inside 
your team by hiring more people or that simply can’t be hired in. That’s why 
a network is usually part of the implementation process.
Think of the inventor as being the core, with the development team arranged 
in a tight circle around him or her. The network of partners that you build 
forms a wider circle surrounding and supporting the development team. 
Beyond the network is the wide world in which you plan to implement the 
innovation. The network helps support the team’s work and also builds a 
bridge to the people you need to adopt your innovation.
Networks vary from temporary to established. You may be able to tap into 
your existing personal, professional, or commercial networks for help with 
your innovation. Alternatively, you may choose to create a network specifi-
cally to aid your invention or development processes; start by examining 
all your existing networks to see whether any might be helpful to you. By 
tapping into existing networks, you may be able to ramp up to collaborative 
activity more quickly because the relationships already exist.
 
The people and organizations in your existing networks are motivated to help 
you because they may provide help to return a favor that you’ve done for 
them (or will do for them). You may run into resistance to innovation within 
existing networks, however, because their members often have a stake in how 
things are traditionally done and may resist your efforts to introduce change.
If you need to create a new network to help you develop or diffuse your inno-
vation, start by identifying people, teams, organizations, and/or institutions 
that may see some benefit in collaborating with you. When you invite these 
people or groups to participate, make the potential benefits clear and 
specific. In other words, tell all the parties what’s in it for them.

257
 Chapter 15: Managing the Development of an Innovative Idea
A partnership approach to cleanup
Like many other U.S. cities, Wichita, Kansas, 
faces a problem: cleaning up old industrial 
sites where groundwater is contaminated by 
tetrachloroethene (used to dry-clean clothes), 
trichloroethylene (used to clean metal parts), 
and other chemicals. To simplify the cleanup 
process and reduce its cost, city engineers 
were eager to try innovations such as the use 
of bioremediation and reactive walls rather 
than conventional pump-and-treat methods 
and hydraulic control rather than aquifer 
restoration. Any treatment that minimizes the 
amount of soil and water that a city has to move 
is good because it’s cheaper, but deciding to 
try new treatment methods is one thing, and 
actually implementing them is quite another.
For starters, federal regulators have to be 
convinced that alternative approaches will 
work, so a careful technical analysis has to 
be performed to sell the concept. Then the 
work has to be funded. Wichita uses a tax 
increment district (TIF) to raise funds. Inside 
the TIF, property taxes are frozen, and as the 
cleanup work goes on and property values rise 
because of it, the city taps into some of the 
increased land value to help it secure bonds 
used to raise funding for the work.
In addition, the city of Wichita offers liability 
releases for current property owners to get 
them on board with the program by removing 
their fear of costly lawsuits.
To pull off a major remediation project, Wichita 
typically builds an informal team that includes 
neighbors, property owners, and the engineering 
firm working on the project, as well as banks 
that provide help with financing. The success of 
such projects depends on the skill with which 
city officials build partnerships to sell, fund, and 
implement their innovative approach. The term 
that they use for all that coalition building and 
cooperative planning is partnering, and it’s the 
most important element in a successful cleanup.
For more information on this case, see 
the Human Sciences Research Council’s 
description at www.engg.ksu.edu/
HSRC/97abstracts/doc59.html.
 
Members of networks tend to collaborate because each member sees a benefit 
from collaboration, but it’s important to recognize that each party may be 
pursuing slightly different benefits. You may need to balance these differing 
goals and protect your innovation from the potential for conflict and competition 
that these goals represent.
Launching the Innovation
The baby bird must eventually leave the nest. Will it be ready to fly? Only if you 
anticipate its needs and problems, and make sure that it’s ready for the rough-
and-tumble world beyond the protected boundaries of your development team.

258
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Emphasizing planning, preparation, 
and refinement
 
Procter & Gamble’s system for launching a new product is a pretty good one 
for just about any innovation. It consists of the following six steps:
 
1. Discovery: This step is the research stage, in which creative ideas are 
developed.
 
2. Design: Concepts are turned into prototypes, and detailed planning is 
done to refine the concept and prepare it for implementation.
 
3. Qualify: This step involves a thorough analysis of the market potential, 
risks, and potential rewards to make sure that the design is strong 
enough to be worth launching.
 
4. Ready: Designs that make it through the qualification step are prepared 
for launch.
 
5. Launch: This step is actual rollout of the innovation, which is often 
staged so that an initial test can be performed and the details of the 
launch plan refined before the innovation goes national.
 
6. Leverage: Successfully launched products are studied to see how they can 
be refined by improving their management and introducing efficiencies to 
cut costs.
The take-away lesson from P&G’s innovation process is that half the steps — 
Steps 4 through 6 — are dedicated to getting the launch right. The idea of a 
specific step called Ready is great! I want you to incorporate a similar step in 
your management of innovations. Take time to assess the needs and barriers 
to implementation or launch, write a launch plan, and make sure that you 
know what resources you’ll need.
 
With careful preparation and planning, the Launch step goes much more 
smoothly, but nasty surprises sometimes occur. Flaws are revealed in the 
design, unintended consequences are discovered when people start using it or 
you find more resistance and less understanding than you’d expected. That’s 
okay. Just return to planning and adjust your approach based on the feedback.
I also love the idea of a Leverage step. This is a great term for the process of 
refining and maintaining the implementation. When your launch is over, it’s 
easy to take your foot off the gas pedal and sit back, but avoid this temptation; 
it’s not time to rest yet! A successful launch is just the beginning of a new 
process. It earns you the happy opportunity to refine your design and perfect 
your production and marketing or other specifics of the implementation. (See 
Chapter 16 for ways to maximize the spread of your innovation.)

259
 Chapter 15: Managing the Development of an Innovative Idea
Promoting the project
Whatever your innovation is — a new idea, such as getting nurses to use 
hand sanitizer before touching a patient, or a new consumer product, such 
as a P&G launch — you need to put careful attention into telling your target 
market about the innovation. Promotion is always integral to a good launch.
Promoting the project means building support within your organization and 
throughout the network of business partners you’re going to need to 
implement the innovation. You’ve got a variety of ways to go about building 
support and participation for the implementation. Use all your options to 
influence others to help you, including communicating the details of the 
innovation, explaining how to use it, and providing support for those who 
are struggling to use it for the first time.
Communicate
Tell the story of your innovation simply and well, cutting through the 
complexities and getting to the benefits so that people understand right away. 
Communicate often, and communicate with everyone who has a stake in the 
innovation or in the old ways that have to be discarded to implement the 
innovation. Your role as a communicator is important. Don’t forget to tell and 
retell the story of your innovation, pointing out why it’s important and good.
Explain
Share expertise and information to fill in missing knowledge about how to 
implement the innovation. Often, innovations have a technical aspect, and 
people may resist implementation simply because they don’t understand the 
technology. Help by teaching and by bringing in other teachers who have 
even deeper expertise than yours. Filling the knowledge gap is a key part of 
implementing any innovation.
Authorize
If you’re in a position of authority, use your positional power to get your 
subordinates in line and working on the implementation. Redefine their roles 
and duties as needed to make sure that they’re pulling the innovation for-
ward. In addition, talk to others with authority, and get them on board too. 
Make sure that those in positions of power give out the needed assignments 
to move your implementation ahead.
Negotiate
Identify the people and groups inside your organization and beyond it who 
need to be part of the implementation process. Open friendly negotiations 
with those parties to get them to agree to do their parts. Pull any political 
strings you may have, and call in personal favors if need be, to align the right 
implementation partners for your plan.

260
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Support
Offer encouragement and empathy as needed for anyone who’s having trouble 
or experiencing uncertainty and doubt. Implementation can be a rocky road, 
and you may need to keep spirits up by using your relational skills. It’s helpful 
for people to know that you care, not only about the innovation, but also 
about them!
Projecting the rate of adoption
Along with the timeline and budget for your development work, you need to 
make a projection of the spread of your innovation, because this timeline is 
important for your planning. If you develop a new, stronger, food-grade inner 
bag for use in boxed packages of cereals, cake mixes, and the like, your 
projection of the rate of adoption by makers of those food products will tell 
you how quickly to ramp up your production of the bags. You don’t want to 
overproduce inventory or overinvest in manufacturing equipment, but 
neither do you want to come up short. Chapter 16 shows you how to project 
the diffusion curve (the rate of spread of your innovation).

Chapter 16
Spreading the Word to 
Diffuse Your Innovation
In This Chapter
▶ Developing a sound strategy for spreading your innovation to all potential users
▶ Using appropriate media at each step of the diffusion process
▶ Using giveaways to speed the diffusion process
D
iffusion is the sometimes-difficult process by which a good new idea or 
invention takes hold and spreads throughout a social network, which 
could be your market, your industry or profession, or even an entire country. 
Understanding how ideas, inventions, and innovative products spread is 
essential to your success as an innovator. Often, it’s not the best design that 
wins the day, but the best-promoted design. You need to know how to spread 
the good word and get everyone excited about using your innovation to 
ensure its ultimate success.
This chapter shows you how to maximize the chances of success for your 
new idea by taking advantage of the natural pattern of diffusion.
Strategizing to Spread Your Innovation
The term diffusion comes from chemistry, in which it refers to the movement 
of particles through liquids or gases. High school science classes demonstrate 
diffusion by releasing a drop of perfume in the front of the room and then 
seeing how long it takes for the scent to reach every desk and student. (Not 
long.) Most innovations, however, encounter far more resistance than perfume 
does as it passes through the air, so you must master innovation marketing to 
make sure that your innovation gets the recognition and success it deserves.

Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Brushing up on history
Did you brush your teeth this morning? I did. 
Everyone does, right? But brushing one’s 
teeth is a relatively recent thing in human his-
tory. Toothbrushes were invented in the 1600s 
in China, from whence they spread slowly, 
carried by travelers to Europe and Japan. The 
early toothbrushes were expensive, handmade 
from bone handles, with natural boar bristles 
inserted into drilled holes in the handles and 
held in place by tiny wires. Before the early 
1800s, people mostly used toothpicks rather 
than brushes, and their teeth decayed at an 
alarming rate.
Toothbrushes didn’t catch on in America until 
the mid-1800s, when the first patent for a 
toothbrush design was issued in the United 
States. (It was awarded to H. N. Wadsworth 
in 1857.) The biggest moment in the history of 
the toothbrush, however, came in 1866, when 
Florence Manufacturing Co., in the town 
of Florence, just a few miles from Amherst, 
Massachusetts, where I’m sitting as I write 
this chapter, began to produce a mass-market 
toothbrush under the brand name Pro-phy-lac-tic 
(and yes, it was actually spelled that way, with 
four hyphens — branding has gotten more savvy 
since then!). The mass-produced toothbrush 
caught on when the price became affordable 
and advertising spread the word about it, and 
the company did very well.
The toothbrush finally took off in the United 
States more than 200 years after its invention 
because the Florence Manufacturing Co. was 
already advertising its hairbrushes and was 
familiar with the emerging practice of advertising 
in newspapers. A mass advertising campaign 
helped diffuse the toothbrush innovation by 
making people aware of it.
This toothbrush example illustrates the need for 
widespread communication with target users to 
spread an invention broadly. You need a strategy 
to spread your innovation too — ideally, one 
that gets the word out in fewer than the 200 
years it took for the toothbrush to become an 
everyday household item!
Identifying potential adopters
The people who will use your idea or buy and use your invention are the 
adopters of your innovation. Who are they? How numerous are they? What will 
it take to get them to try your invention? The more insight you can gain on 
your future adopters, the better, because you need to figure out how to hasten 
the rate at which they adopt your innovation. First, though, it’s important to 
get a good idea of the scope of your potential market (the number of people 
who are likely to adopt your invention) by asking yourself these questions:
 
✓ Is it something that the average household or person could afford to buy 
and/or use?
 
✓ Is it something that a typical (as opposed to big) business could afford 
to buy and/or use?
 
✓ Does it compete with multiple alternatives, or does it stand alone as a 
unique invention?

263
 Chapter 16: Spreading the Word to Diffuse Your Innovation
The size of your potential market is reduced if your innovation is highly 
specialized — something that most people or businesses wouldn’t ever need. 
Consider an example from my own experience.
Over the holidays one year, my daughter Sadie made a gingerbread house 
decorated with frosting and candy from a kit sold at the grocery store. It 
looked great, but it fell apart because the roof and wall pieces were plain 
rectangles that had to be held together with frosting, which isn’t the most 
durable of construction adhesives. So I drew up a design for gingerbread pans 
that would interlock via dovetail joints and would be more structurally sound.
What’s the potential market for this invention? Hmm. I could calculate it by 
counting households that
 
✓ Have young children
 
✓ Do arts-and-crafts activities at home
 
✓ Celebrate Christmas
 
✓ Can afford to spend money on specialty pans
 
✓ Like to cook
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, there are about 115 million 
households in the United States. Wow, I’m going to be a millionaire! But wait — 
only 78 million households have children, and of those, about half don’t have 
children younger than 18 living at home. I don’t expect many teenagers to want 
to use my gingerbread-house pans, so I’m going to cut that number in half to 
target households with young children.
Now my target market has dropped to around 25 million households — still 
a good number but certainly less than I first thought. I have to cut it again 
when I consider that some households with young children don’t go in for 
traditional Christmas activities like making gingerbread houses, and some of 
the ones that do aren’t going to feel like spending money on specialty pans. 
Then I have to cut my estimate farther because some of the remaining house-
holds don’t do much cooking.
I’m down to a market of about 10 million households now. Maybe I won’t 
become a millionaire from this invention after all. In fact, I may not be able 
to sell it through mainstream grocery stores because the potential market 
is too small. Almost all households buy potato chips, for example, and they 
buy them year-round. My invention — a specialized set of pans for making 
better gingerbread houses — is used only once a year by at most 10 percent 
of households, so unlike potato chips, it probably isn’t worth the shelf space 
from a grocery store’s perspective. I’ll have to market my specialized baking 
pans some other way, such as via a targeted direct-marketing campaign using 
e-mail and a Web store.

264
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Working through the mental exercise of analyzing the potential market for an 
invention tells you a lot about who might use it and how widely it might 
eventually spread or diffuse, but you still don’t know how fast it will diffuse. 
The pace of diffusion is also a key strategic consideration, and I discuss it in 
the following section.
Finding out how fast your 
innovation will spread
If your invention is a good one — and I assume that it is! — you can expect it to 
spread at some natural rate. That rate may be quite slow, however. It’s amazing 
how gradual the early spread of a good idea or invention often is, as you see in 
Figure 16-1, which shows the typical diffusion curve for an innovation.

Timeline
As Figure 16-1 shows, on average, a small fraction of the potential user base 
for any innovation actually adopts it early on. Only 2.5 percent of potential 
users are innovators who embrace new ideas and products quickly and 
eagerly. Another 13.5 percent are so-called early adopters, who are fairly 
open to innovations and willing to try them after a few innovators have taken 
the first plunge. The third group to adopt an innovation — the early majority — 
is a bigger group, and when you reach those people, you’re assured of 
establishing your innovation.

265
 Chapter 16: Spreading the Word to Diffuse Your Innovation
Diffusion usually follows an S-shaped curve, like the solid line in Figure 16-1. 
Without special help from you, that curve may be a very stretched-out S with 
a gradual slope that spreads out across years. The length of the diffusion is 
related to several factors that you can consider as you make your best guess 
about the speed of spread:
 
✓ An innovation that depends on other innovations (such as a supporting 
technology) may have to wait until the related technology spreads. 
If your invention is a fold-out portable keyboard that turns a phone into 
a fully functional word processor, your market will be limited by the 
speed at which cellphones with large, easy-to-read screens and powerful 
processors are embraced by people who do a lot of writing.
 
✓ An innovation that requires a significant change of behavior will spread 
more slowly than one that fits into existing behaviors. The treadmill, for 
example, allowed people to run in their homes or at fitness clubs. People 
who already ran outside found it easy to adapt to the new machine, and 
it spread quickly. The cross-country skiing machine spread much more 
slowly, however, even though it offers a better all-around workout than a 
treadmill does. The problem is that most people don’t already ski cross-
country, so the motion is unfamiliar to them.
 
✓ An innovation that is costly to make will probably have a high price 
tag until economies of scale are reached. High initial cost is a big 
barrier to adoption and slows the diffusion curve significantly.
 
✓ An innovation that is costly to adopt is doomed to slower adoption than 
easy-to-use innovations. It didn’t cost very much for you to switch from 
music CDs to digital downloads, for example, because you could get free 
software and use your existing computer to download songs. You can’t 
use your existing computer or television set, however, to watch movies 
in ultra-high-definition (UHD) — an emerging standard that’s expected to 
become available in the next five years or so. Existing monitors will have 
to be replaced by models that produce resolutions four times higher than 
today’s high-definition monitors, and the new monitors probably will be 
quite expensive at first. Expect a slow, forced march to UHD, with many 
consumers resisting because of the cost of switching over.
Setting the strategic parameters
When you’ve identified the likely first users and the ultimate user base, you 
can see the diffusion path fairly clearly. Add your analysis of any barriers to 
diffusion (such as high cost) to get a general idea of whether the innovation 
will spread slowly or rapidly.
 
To refine your timeline, look for comparisons with innovations that have had 
a similar effect in the past, such as an earlier-generation technology. Also look 
at contemporary innovations and how fast they’re spreading to the same user 
base. This information gives you a clue about whether adoption curves are 

266
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
getting faster. Technology-based consumer innovations, for example, spread 
more quickly now than they used to because consumers are increasingly 
savvy about and interested in new technologies.
When you have a general sense of the timeline of spread and know who will be 
adopting the innovation when, you can draw your own diffusion curve show-
ing specific estimates by year, based on the generic one shown in Figure 16-1 
earlier in this chapter. Treat this curve as your base projection, assuming a 
natural rate of diffusion; then ask yourself what you can do to speed the pace 
of adoption above the natural rate.
I don’t know about you, but I’m usually pretty impatient to get people to 
recognize and try something that I’ve created, and I’m also eager to get 
market share before someone else does, so I like steep diffusion curves and 
very rapid adoption rates.
Targeting those early adopters
It’s best to hasten the diffusion curve by reaching out to enlist innovators and 
early adopters right away. (I explain early adopters in the section “Identifying 
potential adopters,” earlier in this chapter.) To refine your strategy for 
spreading your innovation, ask yourself a couple more questions about the 
potential user base or market for your innovation:
 
✓ Who is most likely to want to try something new right away?
 
✓ How can I reach out to inform and excite these innovative users who like 
to be the first to try anything new and forward-thinking?
By aiming communications at innovators and early adopters, you can jump-
start the diffusion process and make sure that it gets momentum fairly quickly. 
Often, you can use standard marketing methods too, but you’ll be aiming at the 
most innovative and daring of your potential customers, so you need to choose 
your message and your media with them in mind. (See my book Marketing For 
Dummies [Wiley] for more information on designing a marketing program.)
Signing up beta testers
Beta testing is the initial trial use of an invention or process by a small group 
of sophisticated users. One good way to get early adopters to try your inno-
vation is to give away samples (see “Priming the Pump with Freebies,” later 
in this chapter) — but not just to anyone. Focus your trial offers on those 
people or organizations who have a proven track record of embracing the 
new and are suited to beta testing your innovation. It’s okay to confine your 
beta tests to those on your short list and not to make the offer to the public.

Getting community leaders onboard
Back in the 1970s, government social workers 
in northern Finland were frustrated that people 
seemed to be unwilling to change their diet 
and lifestyles to reduce the risk of heart dis-
ease, which was a major cause of death in the 
area. Public information campaigns involving 
advertisements and educational brochures 
didn’t seem to have any effect. People were set in 
their ways — which included a sedentary life-
style and a diet including too much animal fat.
With the help of Everett M. Rogers, a professor 
at Stanford University and the world’s leading 
expert on diffusion of innovations, a team of 
Finnish social scientists recruited 800 community 
leaders in North Karelia, a region of several 
hundred thousand people. The 800 lay lead-
ers were invited to attend training sessions 
and were armed with in-depth knowledge of 
lifestyle changes that prevent heart disease. 
The group included people whom others 
respected and looked up to as role models. 
Recent follow-up studies show dramatic effects. 
The innovative ideas about healthier living 
spread rapidly from the small core group, and 
the rate of heart disease in Northern Finland fell 
significantly over several decades — a fairly 
short period of time for a major improvement in 
public health.
Your goal may not be to prevent heart disease; 
it may be to persuade manufacturers to adopt 
your new technology or consumers to embrace 
your new product. The dissemination process 
is the same for both goals, however. Rather 
than spreading your advertising or publicity 
over thousands and thousands of people, try 
targeting only likely role models and leaders. 
Win a few hundred leaders, and you’ll soon find 
that you have tens of thousands of followers 
onboard too.
When you start selling a product, you’re required to be even-handed and 
consistent about pricing it, which means that special offers targeting only 
the privileged few won’t fly legally. (To make sure that your pricing approach 
meets legal requirements, check with your corporate lawyer first.) But in the 
initial testing stage, before you’re selling it to the market as a whole, you can 
usually be as selective as you want.
 
Your testing program can be more or less formal depending on how long and 
involved a test you need to perfect the product. Go for formality if you need sites 
where you can study users as they adopt a software program, for example, so 
that you can set up a way of recording bugs and observing user behavior. Be 
more informal if you simply want to get a bunch of people to try something new.
 
A Dutch bulb breeder contacted garden clubs in the northern United States 
with a request for volunteers to try a new, hardier variety of tulip bulbs. The 
feedback in the spring was very positive, with many gardeners asking for 
more, so the breeder introduced the bulbs into the region and launched a 
successful new product line.

Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Recruiting informal champions
Find people who act as informal leaders, or champions, and persuade them to 
be the early adopters. How? By giving them individual attention, free samples 
and support, or special education on using the innovation. This method 
works surprisingly well. You can recruit your champions face-to-face or 
(if you’re good at Web marketing) by targeting bloggers who have lots of 
followers and Facebook members who have lots of friend requests.
Designing Your Media Mix 
for Maximum Diffusion
Your media mix is the selection of advertising and other marketing com-
munications you use to inform potential users about your innovation and 
(hopefully) persuade them to buy and use it. You can’t just do what you see 
marketers of established products doing, because their marketing mixes don’t 
have to spread the word about something innovative. Your mix needs to be 
more informative that those of established products, and it also needs to 
narrow the message to those most likely to take an early interest: the 
innovative, early adopters who will be first to buy something exciting and new.
Aiming for intelligent, sophisticated buyers
As you expand beyond the first group of beta testers, look for innovators and 
early adopters who have a track record of embracing the new. If you sell other 
products through salespeople, then you probably can introduce your new 
product through your salespeople, too. If you don’t sell directly, then you’ll 
need to advertise. Either way, aim for people who are most likely to buy an 
innovative product — the sophisticated, innovative customers who have a 
track record of embracing new technologies and ideas.
Letting your sales force select the innovators
In a relatively small business to business market, you may already know who 
the early adopters are: the businesses that are leaders in their markets and 
have intelligent, sophisticated buyers. Your sales force or sales representatives 
can identify the top 15 percent of their customers based on how open-minded 
and innovative they are, and you can design a special informative sales 
presentation to tell them about the new product.
Using an indicator to pull innovators out of a larger list
What if you’re targeting a larger, less-well-known market, and you don’t know 
who the most open-minded customers are? This situation is a problem when 
you’re launching a new consumer product, for example, because the United 

269
 Chapter 16: Spreading the Word to Diffuse Your Innovation
States alone has millions of households, and it’s pretty hard to find a list 
broker that identifies them based on how innovative they are as consumers. 
To get around the problem, identify a marker of innovative consumer behavior 
that you think fits your situation. Something relatively new that fewer than 
half of consumers or consumer households have bought will help you identify 
those whose past behavior indicates that they are open to something new.
 
The 25 percent of U.S. households who had high-definition television (HDTV) 
at the beginning of 2009, for example, are more likely to upgrade to 3-D TVs 
in 2010. Companies planning to launch 3-D TVs in 2010 can look to HD early 
adopters as their initial target market. With that clue, manufacturers can 
identify the best states and cities in which to test the market for 3-D TV. Using 
their own sales records or widely available consumer research by firms such 
as Nielsen, companies can identify the cities with the highest percentage of 
HDTV users and focus their initial promotion of 3-D TV there. Washington, 
D.C., for example, is an innovative market, and a third of households there had 
HDTV at the beginning of 2009. Compare that city with Detroit, where a fifth 
of households had HDTV at the start of 2009, and you can make a pretty good 
guess about where 3-D will diffuse more rapidly.
Emphasizing personal media 
in the early days
In addition to personal selling, educational workshops and press interviews 
are good ways to spread the word during the early stages of diffusion. They 
work well because they give you opportunities to speak directly with people 
who are interested in your innovation. Advertise an educational workshop — 
possibly a free one — about your innovation. Send out a press release or, if 
the innovation is really newsworthy, hold a press conference to let the media 
know about your innovation and the workshop you’re holding.
Working with opinion leaders or lay leaders who in turn spread the word 
through their personal networks is also a great strategy. There’s more of an 
educational element to the communication in the first stages of diffusion, so 
personal approaches to communicating make the most sense.
Using industry events to find early adopters
Go to conferences and trade shows (see Chapter 10) where you can present 
your innovation and talk to people who find it interesting. These events gather 
many of the most forward-thinking people in an industry — just the people you 
should be talking to and sharing samples, demos, and spec sheets with.
Using social media to generate electronic chatter about your innovation
Social media can be your best friends during the launch of an innovation. 
Blogs, professional online newsletters, technical and professional chat rooms, 

270
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
and broad-spectrum platforms such as Facebook (www.facebook.com) are all 
great places to generate a buzz about your innovation. If you’re not already part 
of the online conversation in these places, find someone who’s comfortable with 
them to help you begin to communicate about your innovation.
Blogging and being blogged about
Bloggers are an especially powerful force for spreading the word about an 
interesting innovation. Spend some time scanning for bloggers who might be 
interested in your innovation because it’s a match with the kinds of topics 
they’ve covered in the past. From these potentially hundreds or thousands of 
bloggers, cull the ones who have only a few readers, and focus on those who 
have high readership (at least 100 followers). Get in touch with the leading 
bloggers to let them know about your innovation, and ask them whether 
they’d like to try it. If some of the most popular bloggers start talking about 
it, the news will rapidly spread among their readers.
Offering “show and tell” in streaming video
If your innovation is interesting to watch in action, get some early users on 
digital video, and post (or, better yet, have them post) one to three minutes’ 
worth of footage on YouTube (www.youtube.com).
 
The if in this advice is important. If your video is dull, it won’t get noticed, so 
this strategy isn’t very interesting for, say, a new book. Who wants to watch 
video of someone reading a book? Video is great for promoting a new toy, 
however, and many toymakers have learned that an informal product review 
by a friendly customer (often, the son or daughter of an employee) will 
generate interest.
 
It’s also helpful to post video of your product prototype and ask for input. Not 
long ago, I came across a video posted by the inventors of a tabletop device 
that uses hand-operated paddles to bounce a ball back and forth in the style of 
the old Pong computer game. I wouldn’t have guessed that this design would 
attract much interest, but with 90,489 viewers (well, 90,488, if you don’t count 
me!), it obviously is generating some enthusiasm. Comments posted on the 
site included helpful suggestions for making the design better, because it had 
a small problem: The ball sometimes got stuck in the middle, out of reach of 
the paddles. With that many viewers and lots of friendly advice, the designers 
of the tabletop game just might have a winner.
Figure 16-2, however, shows the curve of cumulative viewers of this table-
top game video plotted by day over the course of two weeks. You can see a 
healthy S-curve of growing interest in the first week, followed by a leveling-off 
of the curve. That tells you that the audience for this video is probably going 
to max out at around 100,000 viewers, which is good but not outstanding.
A video that goes viral — meaning that it diffuses broadly and rapidly in Web 
communities — shows a longer upward slope to its curve as it reaches 
millions of viewers. From the data in Figure 16-2, you can guess that the 

271
 Chapter 16: Spreading the Word to Diffuse Your Innovation
tabletop game would have a dedicated but limited audience if it were intro-
duced to the market. Keep in mind, however, that YouTube viewership is a 
reflection of how entertaining the video is, which may or may not be directly 
linked to how interesting the innovation shown in the video is. A second, 
more entertaining video of the same game might succeed in going viral.
What if the inventor made a video called War of the Pong Nerds, in which two 
players argue about who’s winning and, halfway through the game, knock the 
game off the table and start to fight about the score? The idea is silly but poten-
tially the stuff of YouTube legend. And if you can become legendary on YouTube, 
you can probably make it in the mass market out here in the real world, too!
Posting informative videos about technically intriguing products
Companies have discovered that a boring but informative video approxi-
mately two minutes long will win viewers on YouTube if it’s about a new and 
interesting product. As I write, microprojectors using light-emitting diodes 
(LEDs) as their light source are entering the market, and 3M has a video 
about one such microprojector that’s had more than 100,000 views.
The video isn’t good theater; it simply shows a salesman making a presentation 
to a prospect, using a microprojector. Why have so many people watched it? 
Forward-thinking consumers who are eager to try new technologies go looking 
for product information, and YouTube is an accessible place to find it.

Adapting your marketing 
to the inflection point
At some point, your innovation reaches the inflection point in its diffusion 
curve — the point where the line begins to slope upward at growing speed. 
Innovative products don’t sell at the same rate next year as last year. As 

272
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
these products approach the early middle half of the market (where the most 
progressive of the average users or consumers adopt the innovation), sales 
should pick up. The inflection point comes none too soon for many innovators, 
who have been struggling to build the market and reach economies of scale 
in production and marketing.
 
Knowing where you are in your innovation’s diffusion curve helps you project 
sales realistically. The curve also helps you decide what media to emphasize 
as you promote your innovation. As you reach the inflection point, where your 
sales begin to go up at an accelerating rate and you’ve penetrated more than 
13 percent of your potential market (refer to Figure 16-1), switch gradually to 
less personal, more mass-oriented media to spread the good word about your 
innovation. Try the following techniques:
 
✓ Billboards and transit advertising, which are cheap and good places to 
start a mass-marketing campaign
 
✓ Advertising on local and cable television stations
 
✓ Banner advertising on mass Web sites such as Yahoo, Google, YouTube, 
and MySpace
 
✓ Mass mailings to purchased lists of potential customers (send postcards 
or catalogs, depending on the depth of your product line)
 
✓ Promotions in mainstream media such as newspapers, magazines, and 
radio talk shows
If one in ten consumers has tried an exciting innovation, you can be fairly sure 
that the other nine have heard about it and want to find out more. Publicity 
and advertising can combine to meet your need for information. As more 
people become familiar with the innovation, the news value goes down, and 
you’ll get less editorial coverage, which forces you to buy more advertising to 
stay visible.
Priming the Pump with Freebies
Some innovations lend themselves well to free sampling. If you have a new 
product that isn’t too expensive to make on a per-unit basis but has signifi-
cant startup costs, consider doing a big initial run and giving most of it away. 
This strategy may speed the diffusion of your innovation and get you quickly 
to that inflection point, where sales start to grow at a rapid rate and profits 
are easier to come by.
Normally in business, you try to avoid giving your product away, but when you 
need to stimulate the diffusion of an innovation that nobody’s heard about, the 
opposite advice may apply. Sometimes, the product is its own best advertise-
ment, and your marketing money is best spent by giving away product.

273
 Chapter 16: Spreading the Word to Diffuse Your Innovation
 
One of my clients is an inventor who created and patented the SmoothClip, a 
clever molded-plastic device that clips onto the bottom of a tube. Different 
sizes fit different tubes, from lip gloss to body lotion, allowing you to push the 
product up the tube and out the end easily and smoothly, with little waste and 
mess. It’s a great design. How do I know? My client has given away a lot of the 
devices, and everyone who has one loves it and tells all of his or her friends to 
get one, too. The clips aren’t even available in stores yet, but they already 
have a following.
Suppose that the SmoothClip is your innovative product. My advice is to make 
the injection molds — the biggest upfront cost — and then do a run of several 
thousand items just for giving away. If you hand out the clips in a large, fashion-
forward urban market (Los Angeles would be great), packaged so as to display 
the brand name and a Web site for ordering, you’ll probably get lots of orders 
from that giveaway, and the diffusion process will have been started. You may 
have to sell through sampling, personal demos, and the Web site until the 
diffusion curve reaches its inflection point. By then, you’ll have a good enough 
initial user base to attract the interest of major retailers.
 
If you’re considering trying a major sampling effort or other ways of getting 
people to try your innovation for free, make sure that you really have a large 
potential market that’s worth investing in upfront. If your research indicates 
that 60 percent of women and 5 percent of men frequently use cosmetics in 
tubes and are likely to want your new clip to help them control the application 
of these products, you can project a potential market of roughly 65 percent 
of the adult population. That’s a nice fat market with plenty of potential to 
repay your initial investment in free samples. It’s safe to say that you could 
give away 10,000 clips to stimulate the diffusion of your innovation, because 
you ought to be able to sell hundreds of thousands of units when the product 
catches on.

I
ntellectual property includes the innovations and other creative expressions 
of your ideas that you own — assuming that you manage and protect 
them appropriately so as not to lose control of them. You can — and often 
should — pursue legal protection of inventions such as process and product 
designs. You also should copyright your writings, videos, audios, and images, 
whether you’re producing them for sale or using them for advertising or 
other nonsale purposes.
What about your business name and logo, and the names and visual identities 
of your products? It’s essential to protect your claim to your own brands, 
too, especially if you plan to invest in marketing them and making them 
memorable to potential consumers.
Your intellectual property — whether it’s a unique invention, a how-to booklet, 
or a brand identity — has economic value, and the reality is that someone 
else may try to take it. Unless you apply for patents, file for copyrights, and 
register for trademarks when and how you should, you may find that what 
you thought was yours isn’t, and you have no legal recourse when someone 
else starts using it.
Understanding the ins and outs of intellectual-property law and practice is 
essential to the successful implementation of innovations, whether you’re a 
lone inventor, an entrepreneur seeking funding, or an employee taking the 
lead in developing a new product, process, trademark, or any other expression 
of creative design. This chapter helps you get a start on identifying and 
managing your intellectual property, but you will probably need to get 
professional help from a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property, 
because it does get quite technical and I can’t cover such a detailed and

Determining and Keeping Track of Your 
Intellectual Property Assets
What do you have that might qualify as valuable intellectual property? Most 
businesses have a lot of intellectual property (sometimes referred to as IP) to 
protect, and sad to say, they usually don’t take proper care of that property. 
Intellectual property could be even more valuable to your business than hard 
assets like trucks, equipment, and buildings. Intellectual property is a major 
asset, and so you may want to seek expert advice from an IP attorney as you 
assess your IP and decide what needs protecting.
Deciding what merits protection
Here’s a checklist of some of the main kinds of intellectual property. If you, 
you business, or your employer has any of the following, you need to have a 
strategy to protect their value:
 
✓ Secret formulas, recipes, or processes that competitors may want to get 
their hands on
 
✓ Inventions, including designs for products and processes that you think 
may be original and of commercial value
 
✓ Ideas for inventions that haven’t been fully designed yet but that you 
think may be worth developing further because they could be original 
and valuable
 
✓ Designs that you think are exceptional and recognizable and that you 
wouldn’t want competitors to copy
 
✓ Written works, including fiction and nonfiction (such as this book), 
whether long or short, that you think are original and of value
 
✓ Works written for performance, such as musical, dramatic, or choreo-
graphic works
 
✓ Pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works of artistic value
 
✓ Motion pictures and other audiovisual works, including television and 
streaming video ads and short videos
 
✓ Brand names that are distinctive and associated with your business or 
products and that you wouldn’t want competitors to use

277
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
 
✓ Logos or visual symbols that are distinctive and associated with your 
business or products and that you wouldn’t want competitors to use
 
✓ New varieties of plants that you developed and want to sell without 
competitors or customers reproducing them on their own
 
✓ Business records and files, including records of past and present 
projects and products, that you’d be unhappy to lose to theft, fire, or 
other disaster
 
What would you pay for the Coca-Cola formula and name, for example? A lot. 
It’s the most valuable brand in the world, and it pretty much is the company. 
Protecting this asset is key to the success of the company. Most business 
people wish they had intellectual-property problems as big as Coca-Cola’s: 
how to keep someone from stealing the formula and how to police the trade-
marks associated with the brand. These problems are billion-dollar problems 
because of the value of the assets involved.
Assessing the value of your 
intellectual property
After you list your intellectual property, you need to think about the value of 
each item on that list. Three common ways to value IP are
 
✓ Estimate what price you could get by selling the IP. To estimate a sales 
price, look for similar intellectual property that’s been sold recently and 
use any examples you find for comparison. IP is often sold; companies 
license or purchase patent rights to inventions as well as brand trade-
marks. If you have trouble finding good examples to help you value your 
IP, ask an intellectual property lawyer for help.
 
✓ Estimate what you may earn by using the IP over the next five years.
 
✓ Calculate what you’ve invested in the IP. If you have good records of 
what you spent to acquire or create the IP, valuing it on a cost basis 
should be easy.
 
 An accountant may be able to help you value your intellectual property; 
the accountant’s approach is usually based on cost — what you’ve 
invested in the intellectual property.
Which of the three methods is the right one for valuing your IP? It depends 
on who you talk to and what the value will be used for. If you’re selling 
your IP, then fair market value is your guide, even if it’s less than what you 
invested. For listing IP on a balance sheet, your accountant will usually use a 
cost basis. But for deciding which property to emphasize for protection and 
future investment, an earnings basis is best.

278
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Calling the SWOT team
For especially valuable intellectual property, 
you may want to do a SWOT analysis, identifying 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and 
threats to the asset. The SWOT analysis is a way 
to brainstorm and research specific factors that 
may affect the asset and your protection strategy 
for it. It looks at internal (within-company) 
factors and classifies them as either strengths 
or weaknesses. For example, if you produced a 
movie with a major star in it, that actor’s market 
appeal is a strength for the movie. If, however, 
the movie got bad reviews because the plot is 
boring, then that’s a weakness that may offset 
the strength.
A SWOT analysis also looks at external 
(marketplace, environmental, legal, and 
social) factors, and classifies them as either 
opportunities or threats. For a movie production 
company, for example, the sale of pirated DVD 
copies of a movie in Beijing is an external 
threat, whereas the ownership of a really great 
script for a sequel to a best-selling movie is an 
internal strength.
To conduct a SWOT analysis, start by listing 
strengths of the IP in question, such as that 
there are many years of patent protection 
remaining, or that the design is unique and 
increasingly popular. Next, list weaknesses, 
such as a concern that an earlier patent might 
be similar enough to encourage the owner to 
file suit against you. Then list opportunities, 
such as an offer to license your design or an 
idea for combining it with another invention 
to make something that may be easier to sell. 
Finally, list threats, such as the rumor that an 
industry leader is working on an invention that 
might antiquate yours.
Keeping track of the protective steps 
you’ve taken (or need to take)
After you’ve gone through the checklist in the earlier section “Deciding what 
merits protection” and gathered some expert advice from a qualified intellectual-
property lawyer who’s familiar with your industry, you should be able to 
create a detailed list of each piece of intellectual property that you (or your 
employers) own. Follow these steps to create a complete table of your IP:
 
1. Create a blank table with six columns.
 
 You can create this table electronically by using the Table command in 
Microsoft Word or by creating a worksheet in a spreadsheet program 
such as Microsoft Excel.
 
2. Label the first (leftmost) column Our Intellectual Property, and use as 
many rows as necessary to enter its contents.
 
 List each piece of potentially valuable intellectual property in this column.
 
3. Label the second column Protection in Place, and use as many rows as 
necessary to enter its contents.

279
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
 
 Use this column to list any trademarks, copyrights, patents, secrecy 
practices and contracts, backups of data files, insurance policies, and 
any other forms of protection that are currently in place.
 
4. Label the third column Up to Date and Complete?, and use as many 
rows as necessary to enter its contents.
 
 Don’t just put checks or yes/no entries in this column; specify what’s 
been done recently to ensure complete protection of each IP asset in 
your list. Often, when an IP audit gets to this step, many or all of these 
cells are left blank, because in far too many businesses, the intellectual 
property isn’t managed on a regular basis (such as quarterly).
 
5. Label the fourth column Quality of Protection, and use as many rows 
as necessary to enter its contents.
 
 Some of the IP assets won’t have any protection, others will be under-
protected, and still others will be well protected. In many cases, you 
won’t be sure which label to enter for an IP asset because you won’t be 
certain what can or should be done to protect it. That’s okay. Just enter 
a question mark for that asset for now; then do your homework to find 
out what’s appropriate and necessary to do next (see Step 6).
 
6. Label the fifth column Necessary Actions, and use as many rows as 
necessary to enter its contents.
 
 Summarize the next steps needed, if any, to secure full protection for 
the IP asset.
 
7. Label the sixth column Value of Asset, and use as many rows as 
necessary to enter its contents.
 
 For each asset, enter a dollar value (if you have a sense of what the 
market would pay), a loss value (if you have a sense of what losing the 
asset would cost you), or a general value assessment (such as low, 
medium, high, or very high). See the earlier section “Assessing the value 
of your intellectual property” for tips on how to set a price on each 
asset. Try to use a consistent method throughout your table to make it 
easy to compare the items based on their value.
 
Knowing the value of an asset helps you decide how much to invest in increasing 
your protection of it and also helps you prioritize your action plans. Most 
likely, you should focus on high-value, underprotected intellectual property 
first. Sometimes, however, a known threat to a specific IP asset exists, such 
as a copycat competitor, in which case you’ll probably want to focus on that 
asset’s protection first.
Copyrighting As Much As You Can
The easiest form of intellectual-property protection is the copyright, the 
exclusive legal right to reproduce, publish, sell, or distribute the matter and 

280
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
form of something (as a literary, musical, or artistic work). This book has a 
copyright in the author’s name (mine), which I’ve assigned to the publisher 
in a contract that gives Wiley the right to publish my work in exchange for 
royalties (payments based on a percentage of sales). Authors, musicians, and 
other artists know that they need to protect their work with copyrights, and 
so should businesses — but they often don’t.
 
Even though filing for copyrights is easy, you may still want to get legal advice 
about what to protect with copyrights and how. You may be able to protect 
certain wording that’s of value to your sales and marketing, unique computer 
code that you don’t want copied, photographs and videos used in a trade-show 
kiosk, and many other forms of authored content.
Adding copyright protection to your work
The first thing to do with any original authored work is to post a copyright 
notice on it that conforms to the legal requirements for such notices in 
your country. In the United States, notices usually take this form: the word 
“Copyright” and the symbol ©, followed by the first year of publication of 
the work and the name of the owner of the copyright. By posting a copyright 
notice, you declare your claim of ownership of the work.
 
Is your Web site protected? I bet not! To help prevent your competitors from 
using content on your Web site, post a copyright notice clearly on key pages.
By publishing original content with a copyright notice (in a printed brochure 
or catalog or on the Web, for example), you gain significant legal rights. 
If someone later publishes something that’s very similar and apparently 
derived from or copied from your materials, you can take legal action to force 
that person to withdraw the material, and if the other person profited at your 
expense, you may also be able to regain some of your lost profit.
You can strengthen your proof of authorship and be better prepared to 
defend your copyright by filing with the U.S. Copyright Office of the Library 
of Congress. Go to www.copyright.gov, and click Forms. On the Forms 
page, you can take a tutorial before filing electronically (which costs $35 and 
is relatively simple and easy), or you can fill in Form CO on your computer 
and then print it and return it by mail (which costs $50). Fill in the form 
entirely online and print it without making any edits, because the information 
on the form gets incorporated into a bar code as you enter it. It only takes a 
few weeks at most to complete the copyright process in the United States.
If you want to copyright a group of publications at the same time, there’s 
another form for that, and you can still use an old-fashioned paper form for 
filings if you prefer.

The Web site for the U.S. Copyright Office of the Library of Congress contains 
lots of helpful advice, forms, and information, such as how to incorporate prop-
erty copyright notices into your published documents and how to make packag-
ing and licensing agreements for software, music, videos, and other authored 
materials. (If your content or authored product is of potentially high value, how-
ever, don’t do it yourself; hire a competent lawyer to spearhead the effort.)
Getting copyright protection 
when you’re not the author
If you hire employees or freelancers to write or design materials for your 
company to use, you may find that you can’t copyright those materials, 
because you’re not the author. To get around this problem, specify in advance 
that you’re employing these people to create works for hire, and that they’re 
waiving any and all copyrights and recognizing you as the owner of all copy-
rights pertaining to the work in question. Software companies routinely ask 
programmers to sign such releases of rights, and so do many magazines, 
newspapers, and other publishers that work with multiple authors.
Protecting Your Brands 
through Trademark
All businesses should have proprietary brands that add value to what they 
sell. A proprietary brand is a business name or other unique identity (such as 
a product name) that you own and use for your own benefit. If you purchase 
a branded product wholesale and then sell it retail, its brand name isn’t 
yours, but if you make the product, you may give it a proprietary brand name 
of your own. Even if you don’t control the brands that you sell, you certainly 
should protect the brand name of your business, whether it’s a store or other 
kind of business entity.
Managing your brands is partly a creative challenge and partly a legal one:
 
✓ On the creative side, brand management involves the development of 
creative brand identities that are attractive, memorable, and trustworthy. 
Putting good creative effort into brand development pays off, and most 
businesses could and should do more of it.
 
✓ On the legal side, brand management involves a host of activities, from 
standardizing and describing your brand identities to registering for 
trademark protection in your own country and other countries (see the 
later section “Applying for a trademark in the U.S. and elsewhere”).

282
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
 
✓ If you’re establishing a new business, you should also register your 
business name with appropriate state and federal regulatory bodies. 
Some U.S. states require new businesses to file with the Secretary of 
State, while others send you to the nearest courthouse or town hall to 
register your name if you’re a small, unincorporated business, while 
still requiring incorporated businesses to file at the state level. You also 
need to set up your business identity with the Internal Revenue Service 
and obtain a tax identification number for it. For marketing purposes, 
you should also buy a URL that incorporates the name of your brand 
for use on the Web. There’s plenty of homework to do if you’re setting 
up a new business, so talk to your lawyer and accountant, and consult 
a detailed reference such as Entrepreneurship For Dummies by Kathleen 
Allen (Wiley).
 
You may think that you can take charge of trademark filings and do everything 
yourself because the databases — and the forms — are online and easily acces-
sible. Not so! If your trademark is at all likely to be valuable to you or anyone 
else, you ought to use a competent lawyer to spearhead the effort. There’s a lot 
I can’t explain in this section because it’s complex and technical, and there’s 
still more that I can’t explain because trademark law is a specialty . . . not my 
specialty. You wouldn’t take out your own appendix if you had appendicitis, 
and I don’t think you should handle your own trademark legalities either.
Ensuring that your brand is trademarkable
When you develop or improve a brand identity (a name, logo, and possibly 
a tag line or other elements, presented in a specific manner both verbally 
and visually), you give a clear, distinct personality to your brand. (For help 
with branding and naming, see my book Marketing Kit For Dummies as well 
as Branding For Dummies by Bill Chiaravalle and Barbara Findlay Schenck 
[Wiley].) Whether that brand is a business, product line, or specific product, 
there’s considerable value in a good brand identity.
A brand is worthy of a trademark if it meets these criteria:
 
✓ It’s consistent: A consistent presentation is part of the strategy for 
protecting the brand’s value. The more consistent you are in the way 
you show your brand, the stronger the brand will be. If you don’t 
already have one, create a style sheet — a set of instructions with 
examples showing exactly how the brand name or company name is to 
be displayed everywhere it appears. (Graphic designers who develop 
brand identities are familiar with the requirements for style sheets and 
can help you create specifications for your brand.)
 
✓ It’s unique: A unique brand is one that people can’t easily confuse with 
any other. For example, if you want to introduce an air-filled plastic 
wrapping material made of recycled plastic, you might choose to call it 
EarthBubbles®, which differentiates it uniquely from its leading 

283
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
competitor, Bubble Wrap® Brand Cushioning, a trademarked product 
owned by Sealed Air Corporation of Elmwood Park, New Jersey. You 
couldn’t call your product Better Bubble Wrap or anything that uses the 
term “bubble wrap” because Sealed Air Corp. owns that trademark.
 
✓ It’s identifiable: A brand name or logo design needs to be clearly, specifi-
cally defined, right down to the exact wording, the kind of lettering, the 
colors used, and other particulars, so that it’s easily identifiable in every 
instance.
 
It’s good to make sure that there is plenty of elbowroom for your trademark. 
Refine it with more specific language (such as a second term) if it’s too 
hemmed in by existing marks.
Applying for a trademark in 
the U.S. and elsewhere
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Washington, D.C., handles registration 
of trademarks in the United States. Go to its Web page at www.uspto.gov/
trademarks for information on trademarks, searches, and registrations.
It’s a good idea to seek protection of your trademark in foreign countries as 
well. The Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks makes it 
possible to register in many countries at the same time through a single filing 
with the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva, Switzerland 
(www.wipo.int).
Trademarks are granted for specific uses. Suppose that you want to register 
the name Orion as a trademark for a new line of handheld navigation aids for 
hikers and sailors. You would apply for protection for these uses, not in other 
categories. Your trademark might be similar to one in another category (a 
registered trademark for Orion Capital already exists, for example), but your 
request might still be granted if the proposed use is unique to your category.
 
To strengthen an application to register a trademark, make it more specific 
and unique. The name Orion isn’t as easy to protect for a handheld navigation 
device as Orion Navigator, for example. Adding the second word to the name 
makes it truly unique. I can’t find any products with that name by searching 
commercial and Web databases; I also can’t find any U.S. trademark registra-
tions in that name (see “Searching for existing patents” later in this chapter).
Similarly, Navigator is a relatively weak name for a handheld navigation 
device because it’s fairly obvious (possible a generic term), and also because 
it’s been registered as a trademark for a Web browser, an automobile, and 
other products. Even though these registrations aren’t in the same category 
as your product, they might impinge on the perception of uniqueness in 
consumers’ minds. Distinct and unique trademarks are the strongest kind.

That recognizable red cross
The American Red Cross has such a well-
known name that it was able to raise more 
than $6 million on one day — the day after the 
horrible earthquake in Haiti in January 2010. 
Online donations flooded in because many 
concerned people felt safe trusting the 
organization with the task of getting that relief 
to the victims of the quake. You could say, then, 
that the American Red Cross brand name is 
worth $6 million a day in donations. Wow.
The American Red Cross has a legal team 
working on the protection of its distinctive 
logo: the red cross from which the organization 
takes its name. The logo is sometimes licensed to 
companies for use in marketing, such as on 
Band-Aids, marketed by Johnson & Johnson.
The organization also engages in legal action 
to defend its control of its distinctive logo. 
Red Cross attorneys insisted that Lions Gate 
Entertainment, the producer of the movie 
Saw III, remove the red cross from the risqué 
uniforms worn by nurses in posters advertis-
ing a Halloween blood drive sponsored by 
Lions Gate. Even though the drive was a chari-
table effort to get donations to the Red Cross 
blood bank, The Red Cross determined that the 
association of the Red Cross logo with the 
nurses in the poster was inappropriate.
Increasing your chances for 
trademark approval
To prevent confusion and possible legal trouble (in the form of suits from 
companies that think you’ve infringed their trademarks), make sure that your 
brands and logos can’t possibly be confused with existing ones. If there’s 
even a chance of confusion, you could be forced to give up your mark. This 
is where your creativity comes in. Adjust or improve your logos and brand 
names until they truly stand apart from all others!
To check whether your name and logo are distinctive, search relevant 
databases, starting with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Trademark 
Electronic Search System (TESS). Go to www.uspto.gov, and click Search 
Marks to find a basic TESS search option.
Establishing your rights 
by using your mark
If you’ve just designed a new logo and want to protect it before starting to 
use it, you need to file an Intent to Use form along with your application for a 
U.S. trademark, because trademark law (unlike patent law) requires use. You 
can’t just sit on a brand name or logo; if you don’t use it, you lose the rights 

285
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
to it. Begin to use your design as soon as is reasonably possible, and make 
sure that you file a Statement of Use within six months of being granted your 
U.S. trademark based on an Intent to Use filing.
If six months is too soon, you can file an extension request and gain another 
six months for a $150 fee. In fact, you can extend the deadline five times, but 
eventually, you must show proof (examples and samples) that you’re actually 
using the trademark in commerce; otherwise, you lose your rights to it.
Unlike patents, trademarks can be applied for after initial use without forfeiting 
any rights — unless someone else happens to file for a similar trademark in 
the interim, in which case you’ll wish that you’d been more prompt so as to 
prevent competitors from thinking that the trademark was available.
 
If you have a great logo in hand and want to begin using it, and if you’re quite 
sure (based on searches of relevant trademark and business databases) that 
nobody else has a similar one in your class of business, go ahead and start 
using it. Print it on letterhead; stamp it on products; use it on packaging, 
labels, displays, Web sites, and advertisements. If you haven’t been granted 
your U.S. trademark yet, show your intent to trademark your logo by including TM 
after the brand name or symbol. After your trademark is granted, you should 
switch to ® directly following the trademark, to show that it’s registered.
Pursuing Patent Protection
So you have an invention, such as a new product or process, that you think is 
unique and special, and you want to protect it from copycats and imitators. 
Great! Figure out whether it qualifies for patent protection by asking yourself 
these questions:
 
✓ Is it useful?
 
✓ Is it unique?
 
✓ Is it nonobvious?
If your initial answer to all three questions is yes, there’s a good chance that 
your innovation is patentable. Your opinion isn’t the one that matters, how-
ever. It’s up to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to decide whether you’ll 
receive 20 years of exclusive rights to your invention — or not. Often, appli-
cations are turned down, although a rejection may be due to a poorly written 
application or a lack of proper background research rather than anything 
fundamentally wrong with the invention itself.
 
Can you file for patent protection yourself? Sure. You can also do your own 
retirement planning, fill your own dental cavities, and replace the roof of your 
two-story house — if you don’t mind running the risk of messing up your patent 
application, ruining your teeth, and falling off your roof. Okay, that’s a bit harsh, 

286
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
because some amateurs do succeed at winning patent protection, but generally, 
it’s wise to get good legal advice, and that means spending some money. Patents 
usually cost more to obtain than other forms of legal protection for your 
intellectual property, and take longer, too — as long as a year in many cases.
Searching for existing patents
All too often, entrepreneurs and inventors get well into the application process 
before discovering that someone has patented something similar already. Just 
because you haven’t seen a similar invention for sale, don’t assume there are 
no competing patents! Many patent applications are rejected because an existing 
patent covers some or all of the design or invention. No doubt the inventor 
who submitted the rejected application thought that she had done something 
completely original, but with millions of patents on file, it’s easy to repeat 
something by accident. Professional patent lawyers examine all similar patents 
carefully and may suggest editing the application to differentiate your inven-
tion more clearly from past patents. You can improve your chances of success 
by doing your own preliminary search.
 
There are two U.S. patent databases: 1976 and before, and post-1976. It’s 
important to search both. The earlier patents are most likely expired. Expired 
patents are still relevant, however, because your invention isn’t unique unless 
no previous patents — expired or not — are substantially the same.
Take advantage of full-text search post-1976
Patents filed since 1976 are in easy-to-search digital form and are kept current 
to today’s date, which is pretty impressive for a government resource! To do 
a quick search (the best way to scan for any patents that might overlap with 
yours), follow these steps:
 
1. Identify a few terms that describe your invention very specifically.
 
2. Go to the Quick Search page at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 
Web site (patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html).
 
3. Enter your search terms in the Term 1 and Term 2 text boxes.
 
 Use the most general terms that describe the utility or basic functionality 
of your invention, such as squirrelproof and bird feeder. Terms can be 
more than a single word long.
 
4. Set the Field 1 and Field 2 drop-down menus to All Fields.
 
5. Click Search.
 
 A screen displays all patents since 1976 that use your two search terms 
in their title or text, arranged from newest to oldest.
No matter how unique you think your invention is, you’ll be surprised by the 
number of patents that pop up as matches for your search terms.

287
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
Study search results that match your invention
When you get your search results (see the preceding section), open the most 
recent patent (or the most recent one that seems to be at all similar, if the 
search returned too wide a mix of patents). Then read the abstract. Abstracts 
are usually very clear and simple, so you can get the big idea behind the 
invention right away.
Check to see whether your invention is similar to the one in the most recent 
application. If it is, you’re probably going to run into trouble. Most likely, 
you’ll need to redesign the invention to make it more unique, or think up 
another invention and give up on that one. Don’t give up too soon, though. 
Multiple patents can address the same utility or function, but in different 
ways. Numerous patents have been granted for squirrelproof bird feeders, 
for example, because each feeder has a unique design. Maybe your design is 
unique and better than earlier attempts, and your application will be granted!
Continue through the list of search results, checking each one for similarities. 
As you review a result, read the full text of the abstract, and click the Images 
link at the bottom of the page to examine any designs that may be similar to 
yours. Check to see that nobody has used your design or a similar one.
Check references in recent patents for the numbers of earlier patents
Look at the References Cited section that appears just after the abstract. 
Most patent filings reference earlier patents that may be related (and point 
out important differences). The homework that these earlier inventors did to 
identify relevant patent documents is helpful as you do your own research; it 
can point you to additional patents that your search didn’t turn up but that 
you ought to be aware of before you write your application.
What if someone patented something similar to your invention before 1976, 
when digital filings started? Then you have to go into the old-fashioned paper 
files, which used to mean going to Washington, D.C., and asking to review 
actual files. Now the pages of patent filings between 1790 and 1976 have been 
scanned and are online as TIFF images that you can search from this link: 
patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/patimg.htm. Unfortunately, you can’t 
search by term. You have to enter a patent number, which means that you 
need to know that the patent exists and what its number is.
Budgeting the cost of filing a patent
Expect to spend a minimum of $20,000 to file for a U.S. patent application and 
possibly another $10,000 for foreign rights or any minor changes that might 
be required. Conventional advice is to budget $15,000 for your filing, but I 
think it’s wise to double that amount.
Keep in mind that a budget of $30,000 for your legal work is quite modest 
compared with what a large firm might spend. Big companies tend to submit 

288
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
multiple applications in an effort to cover their inventions in multiple ways, 
such as a patent covering the basic design very broadly, along with several 
applications covering specific forms and applications of the design.
 
You don’t pay just to file a patent; you also have to pay to maintain a patent. 
Other filings and fees may be required over the years, as well as costs associated 
with defending the patent from violators. It’s hard to estimate such costs, 
because they vary significantly, but they can be anywhere from $5,000 to 
$100,000 per year, depending on the scale of the patent and the sales resulting 
from it.
Deciding whether a patent is worth the investment
Many entrepreneurs and inventors tell me that they’ve been told by experts not 
to bother with a patent application if they don’t have plenty of additional money 
to spend on defending the patent. I think that’s the wrong way to approach the 
decision of whether to file. If the innovation proves to be valuable — if you’re 
making significant money by selling something based on your patent — 
plenty of funds should be available for legal work, and you’ll want to defend 
your rights assertively. If you don’t have significant sales, you won’t need to 
defend the patent, so don’t worry about future costs now; they tend to be 
self-funding. Focus on the initial investment and on whether it makes sense to 
spend money to file for a patent.
The following checklist can help you decide whether to invest in a patent 
application:
 
✓ Is the invention or design likely to be profitable?
 
 If not, there’s not much point in filing. If you see potential economic 
value to the invention or design, go on to the next question.
 
✓ Is the invention or design likely to be eligible for protection?
 
 The answer depends on whether the item is novel, useful, and nonobvious. 
If you think that your item qualifies on all three counts, go on to the next 
question.
 
✓ Can you make money from a patent covering your invention or 
design?
 
 Sometimes, people come up with concepts that seem to be clever and 
original but are so far from their general area of expertise that they may 
not be able to flesh out the idea fully or bring it successfully to market. 
This question gives you a reality check, making sure that you have a real 
business reason for proceeding. If you think that you can turn the idea 
into a practical design that can be patented and marketed (or licensed 
to someone who can market it), you probably should apply.
 
✓ Can you raise the cash needed?
 
 If you answered “yes” to the first three questions, you’re probably fairly 
sure that an investment in a patent application could provide a good 

289
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
return. If you can divert nonessential funds to the application cost, go 
ahead and fund it yourself. If you’d have to skip several mortgage 
payments to apply, you need to find a partner or investor who has 
deeper pockets than you do. Don’t bet the farm on a patent application!
Saving money by filing patent forms yourself’
Sometimes, inventors file their own patent applications, and some of these 
low-cost applications do get granted, so it’s possible to beat the cost of a 
lawyer-driven patent application process. But it’s likely that you’ll make some 
mistakes and get weaker coverage than you would with proper legal 
representation, so I view self-filing to be the very last resort.
To download instructions and application materials for filing your own U.S. 
patent application, go to www.uspto.gov/patents/process/file/efs/
index.jsp.
To file online in the United States, you’ll use EFS-Web, which makes it quite 
simple to submit PDF pages for review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office. If you’re a confirmed do-it-yourselfer, check the instructions on the 
EFS home page at the preceding link.
 
Writing a really compelling and well-designed patent application is a legal art, 
and I recommend hiring a patent attorney who’s familiar with both the patent 
office and its technology.
Considering foreign patent protection
U.S. patents don’t protect you in other countries. The United States has signed 
the major international treaties concerning patents, but these treaties simply 
give you the right to file for patent protection in other countries too. It’s up to 
you — or your lawyer — to decide which countries to file in and to do the proper 
searches and filings according to those countries’ regulations and deadlines.
If you decide to seek international protection by filing in other countries 
or regions (such as the European Union), keep in mind that foreign filings 
can interfere with your efforts to obtain a patent in the United States. You 
may need to obtain permission from the U.S. Commissioner of Patents and 
Trademarks before filing in foreign countries so as to avoid compromising 
your U.S. application.
Filing a provisional patent
A possible way to stake your claim to an invention without spending thousands 
of dollars on an official filing by an intellectual-property attorney is to file a 
provisional patent yourself. In the United States, go to the U.S. Patent and 

290
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Trademark Office Web site at www.uspto.gov/patents/index.jsp, and 
follow the instructions for provisional filing. Then get to work on your 
application. You don’t want to leave it provisional any longer than you 
absolutely have to.
 
If you think that your invention is really valuable, but you can’t file a patent 
application for financial reasons, you need to keep it secret (see “Protecting 
Trade Secrets” later in this chapter). If someone else finds out about your 
invention or sees your plans, he can copy you, and you won’t be able to do 
much about it because you don’t have a patent.
 
Even worse, if other people spread the word about your invention before you 
file, and the information becomes common knowledge, your application will 
probably be denied simply because other people are imitating your invention. 
Hey, I warned you. File now if you can possibly afford to do — or at least file a 
provisional application to show your intent and establish a timeline.
Assigning or licensing your patent rights
When your patent application is granted, you gain rights that you can assign 
or loan under licensing agreements. Scientists working for drug companies 
and electronics firms, for example, routinely assign their rights to their 
employers because their employment contracts require them to do so. Also, 
companies often license the right to use a patented invention to another 
business in exchange for a fee or royalty of some kind.
 
Such arrangements are best designed and managed with expert legal help.
Protecting Trade Secrets
You may think your application for a patent will be denied, or you may not want 
your control of a recipe or design to expire — which all patents eventually do — 
so you may decide to simply keep it a secret. Of course, this approach works 
best when nobody can tell what your recipe or design is just by looking at it. 
You may be able to keep secret a special formula for a soft drink or a manu-
facturing process hidden inside a locked building, so these are candidates for 
trade secrets.
For example, your recipe for Aunt Matilda’s Magical Muffins may not be pat-
entable, because no matter how wonderful the muffins taste, people have 
been baking all sorts of muffins for a long time, and you probably can’t 
establish that your recipe is truly unique and nonobvious. Still, if your muffins 
taste better than the competition’s, you really don’t want other people to 
start using your recipe, so you’d better keep it secret.

291
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
 
If you have a new recipe or process that you think is a good candidate for 
trade secrecy (because it’s not something others could figure out just by 
studying your product and it gives you an advantage over the competition), 
start by securing the information carefully. Limit the number of people who 
know the secret to the absolute minimum, and make sure that each of them 
signs a contract committing them to keeping it secret. Also keep all records of 
the secret under lock and key somewhere very secure, such as a bank vault. 
You have to take every reasonable precaution to keep your recipe or formula 
secret if you want the courts to treat it as a trade secret.
Unlike a patent, a trade secret has no legal time limits; the only limit is how 
long you can keep it secret, so you could maintain secrecy indefinitely. If 
your time horizon is very brief, you may also want to rely on secrecy instead 
of a patent, because winning patent protection can take a year or more.
Taking reasonable precautions
Here are some strategies for keeping a trade secret:
 
✓ Don’t tell anyone!
 
✓ Break a process into multiple steps, and have different people do different 
steps so that nobody but you knows the entire process.
 
✓ Keep the recipe under lock and key in a safe-deposit box or in your 
lawyer’s office.
 
✓ Warn your employees and anyone else working with you that the recipe 
is secret and that you expect them to respect your right to keep it 
secret.
 
✓ Require everyone who might be exposed to the secret to sign a 
nondisclosure agreement so that they can’t tell other people what they 
find out.
 
✓ Minimize employee knowledge of the trade secret.
 
✓ Don’t try to maintain a trade secret that overlaps with a patent, because 
the contents of your patent application will become public if and when 
a patent is granted. (If you want to keep something secret until you find 
out whether it’s patented, however, that’s fine, because patent 
applications are sealed until the patent is granted.)
 
✓ Maintain tight physical security to limit employee access to your secret 
and to prevent intruders from seeing it at all.
 
✓ Be very cautious about licensing trade secrets, because licensees may 
be more likely to reveal your secret accidentally than you would be.
You may also want to keep customer lists and certain business methods 
secret. Many companies consider their customer lists to be trade secrets. 

292
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
If you’ve built up a valuable database of customers and don’t want anyone 
else to use it to try to take your customers away, you’ll need to maintain 
much tighter security over it than most companies do. For starters, don’t let 
any salespeople have access to the master list. Give them only specific call 
lists generated from your master list. Salespeople may be tempted to take 
their call lists out of the office and use them at the next job.
Enforcing a trade secret
If you take all reasonable precautions to keep a business process secret, but a 
competitor manages to discover it by being exceptionally sneaky, you may be 
able to take that company to court and get an order preventing its use of the 
secret. In the United States, at any rate, courts generally take a dim view of 
corporate espionage and award damages to the company whose secret has 
been stolen.
 
In a well-known case, a competitor took aerial photographs of a DuPont plant 
being built in Beaumont, Texas. The pictures were taken before the plant’s 
roof was completed, so from the photos, the competitor was able to figure 
out DuPont’s secret method for making methanol. DuPont sued to prevent 
the company from using or disclosing the information, and the court ruled in 
favor of DuPont, stating that the company had taken reasonable precautions 
to protect its formula and should not be required to take exceptional steps to 
prevent all possible types of espionage.
Keeping Your Records, Writings, 
Plans, and Designs Secure
A business’s intellectual property includes lots of information that may not 
qualify for any form of legal protection but that is still of high value, such as 
financial records, customer lists, blueprints and engineering specifications, 
research studies, and strategic plans.
In the past, most of this intellectual property consisted of paper documents, 
so companies protected their most critical documents and plans by storing 
them in fireproof cabinets and safes. That’s still a decent idea for protecting 
your most important papers, but now, most important documents are stored 
on computers. In general, you should seek technical assistance from experts 
on electronic data management and protection. Following are some specific 
protective measures for electronic data:

293
 Chapter 17: Protecting Intellectual Property
 
✓ Limit access to electronic documents to a short list of essential people.
 
✓ Create password protection of the actual documents where the software 
program in which they were created permits. In addition, electronic doc-
uments may be stored on computers or discs that are password protected.
 
✓ Isolate key documents from your daily-use computers and networks.
 
If you’re concerned about a trade secret’s protection, consider keeping it on 
old-fashioned paper only to eliminate the risk of someone hacking into your 
computer network and releasing secret documents to the public.
When you audit your intellectual property, take a look at data and document 
security along with the more formal legal IP categories (copyrights, trade-
marks, patents, and trade secrets). Businesses tend to back up historical 
documents such as accounting and tax records, but I find that they often 
overlook records of creative and innovative thinking. Be sure that you 
include the following in your backup plans:
 
✓ Records of the design process for new products or processes
 
✓ Logs of any brainstorming or idea-generation sessions
 
✓ Records of creative processes that proved to be productive in the past
 
✓ Suggestions, proposals, and ideas that haven’t been evaluated or acted 
on yet
 
✓ Market research, both quantitative (such as survey results) and qualitative 
(such as customer suggestions, complaints, and opinions)
 
✓ Innovation plans and records, such as records of research and develop-
ment or new-product teams
 
✓ Prototypes and test results from product trials or experiments
 
✓ Records of failures (so that they don’t have to be repeated)
Innovation-oriented intellectual property needs special protection because 
it’s grist for the innovation mill in the future. Identify, organize, and catalog 
records of innovation, and make sure that the artifacts (documents, proto-
types, and so on) are stored safely and, if feasible, backed up in a remote 
location.
 
Consider the businesses in New Orleans whose intellectual property was 
endangered by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flood. Some of these 
businesses had backed up everything on servers in other cities and were able 
to resume operations right away; others weren’t so lucky.

▶ Finding the funding you need to move ahead
▶ Marketing your patents and inventions to licensees
I
 have an idea for a line of baby clothes inspired by the continual changes 
and wash-ups I’ve experienced as the father of five children. Any parent 
can tell you that baby stains on clothing don’t come out in the wash, ruining 
all those lively pale pink, blue, and white infant outfits that one tends to be 
given as baby presents. Any parent can also tell you that those stains tend to 
be located in two strategic areas: on the front of an outfit and . . . well, in the 
diaper region. I’m thinking about establishing a brand of infant clothing called 
MustardSeed Nonstain Clothing for Fashion-Forward Babies. All the clothing 
will be mustard-colored in high-stain areas. The pretty blues and pinks can 
be used for trim, accent colors, and piping in low-risk areas of the garments.
If I’m serious about my idea, how do I go about building a successful business 
based around it? This chapter covers the basics of entrepreneurship, or the 
development of innovative new business ventures. This process of development 
breaks down into four key steps: doing your homework, writing your plan, 
funding your venture, and selling your invention.
Doing Your Development Homework
You may be ready to run with your great idea, but it’s important to hold onto 
your enthusiasm for long enough to refine your design and figure out how to 
scale it up to the quantity or size needed for full implementation. You need to 
make sure that your innovation is ready to take to market, and the only way 
to determine that is by doing some homework.

296
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Researching and refining 
your idea and market
If you have an idea that you think has the potential to be a good business, 
start by doing your internal and external homework:
 
✓ Research your idea to refine it and turn it into a clear and specific 
thing — a prototype product or the plan for a specific business process 
or type of business. This homework helps you make sure that you have 
more than just exciting ideas. You need to firm up those ideas and make 
them practical and specific.
 
✓ Research your potential market — your customers and competition — 
to see whether your hunch is right that you’ll have buyers for what 
you plan to offer. No matter how well developed and clear your plans 
may be, it’s up to prospective customers to decide whether your product 
is going to be popular or not. Check out existing options and pricing; 
explore attitudes and needs; and if possible, test the product or concept 
on actual customers to see what they say and do.
This research process is really just about the same as it would be for any 
commercial innovation. You start with what seems like a good idea and then 
firm it up through careful, persistent work. Do as much as you can to develop 
your concept into definite plans or designs first, and test your proposed 
offering on customers as well as you can. Build a solid case for why customers 
will think you have something new and special that they’ll want or need.
Deciding whether to proceed 
with your innovation
After you’ve done your homework and refined your idea into a clear plan or 
prototype that tests well on prospective customers, you’re ready to make a 
judgment: whether to go forward or not. This stage is an important moment 
of truth: You look critically at what you’ve developed and at what you’ve 
found out about possible market reaction to it, and then you decide whether 
you have a solid winner.
No matter how well you follow the standard advice on business planning and 
fund-raising for your new business (I cover both topics later in this chapter), 
you won’t find entrepreneurship easy or rewarding unless you have an out-
of-the-box great idea. Don’t rush ahead with the first decent concept you 
think of. Keep thinking. Use the creativity methods in Chapters 6 through 
11 to come up with a really astounding idea that powers your new business 
through the entrepreneurship process with ease. After you have your great 
idea, you can move on to business planning.

297
 Chapter 18: Building a Business Around Your Innovation
Protecting your intellectual property
Is anything about your new business concept proprietary and potentially 
protectable? If you have a product or process that you don’t think others are 
on to yet, you should explore patenting it or see whether it would be best 
maintained as a trade secret (see Chapter 17). Similarly, a uniquely appealing 
design may qualify for a design patent.
 
If you anticipate relying on patent protection for an invention, focus on obtaining 
at least provisional protection before you show your invention to prospective 
customers or investors. In fact, don’t show it to anyone except a patent attorney 
who’s on retainer to you. When it comes to patents, be careful not to allow the 
details to slip out to the general public before you apply for coverage.
Next, you have trademarks to consider. Sometimes, the gist of a new business 
concept is a cleverly appealing brand name. If you have an idea for gathering 
large snail shells and packaging them in cute little house-shaped boxes under 
the brand name Pet Shells, you may want to try to obtain a trademark for that 
brand name to prevent others from using it should you actually manage to 
create a hot new consumer fad.
When you do your trademark and patent homework, you may find that someone 
else has filed a similar invention or mark already. There are two records in 
the U.S. trademark database for Pet Shell, one of which is dead — expired 
due to lack of use — and the other live. Apparently, others have tried to turn 
the idea into a hot consumer fad, probably without success. If you find that 
someone has gotten intellectual-property protection before you, you’ll know 
that you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with another 
great idea. Don’t write a business plan or recruit any investors for concepts 
that someone else already owns!
Writing a Winning Business Plan
Investors who read business plans are unimpressed by fancy spreadsheets 
and elaborately optimistic projections. They look for a solid concept, a great 
team to develop it, relatively low risk, and evidence that there are eager 
customers waiting to buy. Keep in mind the investor’s perspective as you 
pull your team together and begin to write your business plan. (And consider 
getting your hands on a copy of William Sahlman’s How To Write a Great 
Business Plan [Harvard Business Review]; visit hbr.org to purchase a copy.)
When I was just starting out in my career as an author and consultant, I 
sometimes had blocks of time where I didn’t have any paying work lined up. 
I was living in Silicon Valley, home of thousands of high-tech startups, so I 
put out the word that I was available to entrepreneurs to ghostwrite their busi-
ness plans. I was amazed by the flood of requests and worked on close to 100 

298
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
plans in the several years it took for my own business to grow large enough 
to elbow out other work. In all that time I spent writing business plans, I 
found out a few things about the difference between the rare plans that raise 
capital easily and produce winning businesses and the many plans that don’t:
 
✓ Quality of the business concept: The biggest difference between a winning 
business plan and an ordinary (meaning disappointing!) one is what 
happens before you start writing. It’s easy to write a winning plan for a 
strong — really strong — concept that’s well developed and researched 
before anyone tries to craft a business plan for it. Do your homework 
and make sure that you have a winning business concept before you 
bother with writing a formal plan. See the earlier section “Doing Your 
Development Homework” for how to make absolutely certain that your 
idea is ready to take to market.
 
✓ Clarity of the concept: The second major difference I saw between 
winning plans and unsuccessful ones was the clarity of the concept. 
Entrepreneurs who stumble over the question “Tell me about your 
business” aren’t ready to write a good plan. Before you start outlining 
the plan, ask yourself this: What key fact or assertion do you want to 
express to readers? You need to decide on your plan’s core message 
before you start writing because everything that you write needs to 
support that message.
 
 Suppose that you’re thinking about starting a business that makes custom 
bikes for serious riders, especially people who want to ride in extreme 
conditions and need extreme off-road bikes. What’s the core reason for 
starting this business? Your reason may be this: “Extreme riders put so 
many demands on a bike, and themselves, that no off-the-shelf product 
can meet all their needs for performance and safety.” That’s a good clear 
statement of your intended purpose. Details such as whether you’ll make 
the frames of strong, ultralight Reynolds 953 stainless-steel tubing are 
secondary to the main statement of your concept.
 
✓ Length of the concept: It’s difficult but essential to simplify your story 
to the point that you can make it sound compelling in a single sentence. 
When you can write a winning one-sentence version of your concept, 
you’re ready to go ahead and write a full-length, formal business plan.
 
✓ Strength of the team: You need people who know how to build the 
business and are well respected and well connected in the industry. If 
you don’t have your dream team already, hold off on writing that business 
plan and start recruiting partners instead. Savvy investors read the 
résumés before they read the plan, so make sure that you have a team 
that looks great on paper.
The following sections walk you through the elements that make up your 
business plan, with the elements listed in the order in which they appear in 
your plan.

299
 Chapter 18: Building a Business Around Your Innovation
Design the cover, title page, and 
table of contents
It’s rarely necessary to bind a business plan in a fancy or flashy manner. 
The custom is to present it in a simple, conservative (dark-colored, for 
example) paper binder like the kind you can buy at any stationery store. Give 
it a neatly printed title, centered one third of the way down the front cover. 
The title should read Business Plan for [Your Innovation] in 16-point Times 
New Roman or a similar font. Center the date on the line below the title, using 
12-point type in the same font as the first line. In other words, the cover 
should look very simple and traditional.
The title page should mimic the cover but add — two thirds of the way down, 
in centered 12-point matching type — an address with full contact information 
for the business.
On the next sheet of paper, provide a table of contents. Set the header in 
16-point Times New Roman or a similar font, centered at the top of the page. 
Leave a couple of blank lines below the header and then list each main section, 
followed by a dotted line that leads to a page number in a column on the 
right side of the page.
At the bottom of all pages following the table of contents, center a page 
number in the same type style as the main text — 12-point Times New Roman 
or a similar font.
If you recall writing research reports or term papers for high school or college, 
the style I’m describing may seem familiar. It’s a traditional, straightforward, 
professional way to present information without frills or decorations. It 
shows that you mean business and are serious about your proposal, instead 
of trying to dress it up and oversell it with fancy graphic design. Let your 
innovation shine in the uniqueness of your proposal itself, not in the way 
you present it on paper. Lenders and investors are conservative — and why 
shouldn’t they be? They’re risking their money. A flashy plan puts them off.
Write the executive summary
The Executive Summary section is the first thing that most investors and lenders 
read. Keep it remarkably clear, brief, and to the point. The first sentence of 
your summary should be the one-sentence description of your concept that I 
asked you to develop before you started writing (refer to “Writing a Winning 
Business Plan” earlier in this chapter). Complete the first paragraph by providing 
several sentences of general information to explain how you’ll be able to do 
what you say you can.

300
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Imagine that your first sentence is this: “Water Bicycles, Inc., will revolution-
ize cardiovascular exercise by selling floating bikes that can be ridden for 
exercise and fun in pools or at beaches.” This description sounds intriguing, 
but to show that you’re serious and for real, add something such as this: 
“The company has applied for patents to protect its unique designs and has 
demonstrated their use and popularity through extensive consumer trials.” 
A plan opening with these assertions is bound to intrigue most readers.
Next, write a paragraph starting with the words “This plan’s purpose is to. . . .” 
Complete the sentence by describing your fundraising or other needs, such 
as “obtain a bank credit line of $100,000 to fund initial production and 
marketing costs.” Follow this sentence with a description of the benefits 
anticipated for the funder, such as this: “As this business plan explains, 
Water Bicycles, Inc., has a solid management team, a patented and appealing 
product, and a financial plan that should produce ample returns, allowing the 
business to pay down the proposed line of credit or refinance it through an 
equity offering within one year.”
For the rest of the executive summary, touch very briefly on the main sec-
tions of your plan. Devote no more than a few sentences to summarizing the 
main topics of the plan: operations and management, products, marketing, 
and financial projections. Mention the next year’s budget and projected 
sales, but don’t go into any detail. Ideally, the executive summary will be less 
than a page long.
 
Print this section (and all other sections) of your plan on one side of good-
quality white paper.
Write your market analysis
The Market Analysis section of your plan needs to be thoughtful and detailed 
because it’s where you prove there is demand for what you intend to sell. 
Describe the benefits of your product or process and the people who will 
most want to use it. Explain what the competition is offering and why your 
new offering will be more appealing to specific types of customers. Analyze 
the range of pricing in the market and show why your proposed pricing will 
be viewed as reasonable. If you’ve done any testing or market research, 
describe your results here too.
Make sure that you include a clear, specific description of how you’ll market 
and sell the product, including what kind of advertising you’ll do and what 
kind of sales force, distributors, or retailers you’ll use to bring your product 
to market. Include marketing budgets, sales commissions, reseller markups, 
and other marketing costs here.
For help with sales-force design, advertising plans, pricing, and other mar-
keting topics, see Marketing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, and Marketing Kit For 
Dummies, 3rd Edition (both from Wiley).

301
 Chapter 18: Building a Business Around Your Innovation
Prepare a company description
In the Company Description section, describe the form of organization your 
business is in or will take when you secure financing. (In the United States, a 
business can be organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or Subchapter 
S corporation.) Identify all owners and the terms of their ownership interests.
Explain your operations (what you’ll produce and how) and your facilities 
(any offices, factories, or other places where you’ll be performing work). Give 
any other details about the company and its operations and activities that 
might interest a potential investor or lender. Keep your account factual and 
specific, and avoid speculation and exaggeration.
Write a description of your innovation
In the Description of the Product section (or Description of the Process, 
depending on what sort of innovation it is), provide a clear, brief description of 
what you’ve invented; then go into sufficient detail about the specifics to 
convince the reader that your invention has merit and is likely to be successful.
 
As I say at the beginning of this chapter, you ought to have a valuable innovation 
of some kind. Don’t start a business just to start a business. The United States 
has more than 100,000 gas stations, for example, and more than half of them 
have convenience stores, so starting a business that manages gas station/
convenience stores isn’t very innovative. You need to explain why yours will 
be better than competing stores and worth the risk of investment. In this 
section, explain your invention clearly and accurately, emphasizing technical 
information and avoiding anything that sounds like an excited sales pitch.
Provide one to three objective facts to justify your claim to innovativeness 
and value. You might say, “There are more than 100,000 gas stations in the 
United States, but ours will be the first to offer simultaneous fueling, cleaning, 
and computerized mechanical diagnostics, because we’ve invented a patent-
pending service system that performs all these functions inexpensively and 
in the same length of time it takes to fuel a car at a traditional gas station.”
Support your description of your innovation by providing information about 
the competition and showing why your concept is special. If you have (or 
are pursuing) intellectual-property protection, describe those activities here. 
Also, review the practicality and costs of scaling up to full commercial operation. 
If you haven’t worked out how to scale up, admit it, and explain that you’re 
seeking funding to work on your development of the invention.

302
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
Describe the organization and 
management of the business
In a section titled Organization and Management, start by introducing the 
management team, which should include people with the technical and 
business expertise to make the plan a success.
Describe the management team and employees, explaining what each of them 
do. Review the operations of the business in more detail here, explaining 
how each step will be managed and what the main concerns or risks might 
be. Give an overview of your staffing plans or practices, including a summary 
of the costs of salaries, benefit plans, and other details that will determine 
your overall payroll costs. Add information about your legal and accounting 
support; identify and give contact information for your corporate attorneys, 
auditors, and accountants.
Include a short section in which you discuss any major changes that you’ll 
need to anticipate and plan for as the business grows. Will you need to move 
to a larger facility or hire more supervisors, for example? Describe your plans 
for handling such challenges.
Summarize marketing and sales
Use the Marketing and Sales section to describe the target market and the 
ways in which you’ll inform and persuade prospective customers. Your 
purpose is to convince potential lenders and investors that you really can 
make your sales projections and produce significant and growing revenue. If 
you’re not sure of that yourself, do some more research. Identify salespeople 
who will agree in writing to come to work for you when you have your funding 
in place, or sign contracts with distributors or sales representatives (firms 
that do your selling for you). Include these contracts in an appendix, and 
reference them in this section.
Provide an analysis of your target market — the people or businesses you 
think will purchase your product or service. Be specific about who you’ll sell 
to, how many will buy per month and year, and how much they’ll buy. These 
estimates will form the basis of your sales projections, so think them through 
carefully, and explain your thinking clearly enough that potential investors or 
lenders will be able to understand how you produced your sales forecasts.
Present your service or product line
Every product has competition. If your innovation is a big improvement over 
old products, that’s great, but you still have to win customers, which means 

303
 Chapter 18: Building a Business Around Your Innovation
changing their habits and getting them to send their money your way rather 
than elsewhere. It’s helpful to start your About the Product section with a 
table comparing your product’s features with those of its closest competitors. 
Then describe the details of your product and how you plan to produce it. 
The main point of your description of producing the product is to show that 
you understand the costs involved and can realistically produce your product 
for less than half of what you’ll be able to sell it for.
 
If you have any trade secrets, don’t give them away, but do describe generally 
what advantage they give you.
If you have or expect to get patent protection (check out Chapter 17 for more 
on protecting your intellectual property), describe what you’re applying for 
in general terms, but don’t give your invention away unless you’ve already 
won all the patent protection you’re applying for.
Reference any photographs, diagrams, specifications, or drawings of your 
product that appear in the appendix so that readers know to look for them 
there. If you think it’s helpful, include one clear black-and-white photograph 
of the product as an exhibit in this section.
Explain your funding needs
This section is usually called Funding Needs, and it describes what the venture 
requires in the way of debt or equity investment. Make this section clear and 
simple, providing specifics about what financing you’ll need and when. Your 
description of your financing needs should be based on the cash-flow projection 
in your financials. A cash-flow projection lists beginning cash, plus cash 
receipts for each month (such as investments and payments), then subtracts 
spending for the month to see whether you have enough cash to meet your 
spending needs.
Carry the net (whether negative or positive) from the first month over to the 
beginning of the second month in your cash-flow projection, because it’s the 
beginning cash for that month. The second month’s net becomes the third 
month’s beginning cash position, and so forth, across the months of your 
cash-flow table. I recommend using a spreadsheet program such as Excel or 
iWork to build your cash-flow projection; they make it easy to edit and revise 
as you work out the details of your plans.
When you have a year or more of monthly cash flows projected in a spread-
sheet, you’ll be able to see your financing needs. Most new businesses have 
little to no sales in the first year, but lots of expenses, so the losses accumulate 
from month to month. Keep projecting cash flows for future months and 
years until you reach a point where the numbers finally shift to the positive. 
That’s when your plan should begin producing a positive cash flow, giving 
you the ability to repay a loan or provide profits to investors.

304
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
When you have a detailed, careful cash-flow projection covering the entire 
development period until the time when cash flows turn positive, scan the 
monthly bottom-line numbers to identify the biggest loss — often a year or 
two into the venture. The amount of this loss is approximately the amount 
of financing you need to raise in order to fund your venture. You’ll need to 
infuse that much cash in one or several stages during development in order 
to keep your business checkbook from actually going into the red.
Revise your cash-flow projection by showing sufficient investments or loans 
to prevent the balance from being negative. Then produce a summary of 
funding needs based on the timing and amounts of funds your cash-flow 
analysis indicates you’ll need.
 
Be specific about how you’ll use the funds — to purchase capital equipment, 
to cover short-term operating expenses until you reach sufficient volume to 
break even, or whatever else you need the funding for.
Prepare your financials
The Financials section should include three to five years’ worth of historical 
financial statements, if you’ve been in business that long. Show yearly income 
statements, balance sheets, and cash-flow statements. If your business is 
a startup, of course you won’t have historical statements, so you need to 
include only projected financials.
Your projected sales should be based on the sales projections in your Sales 
and Marketing section, and the costs should relate to the description of your 
business in the Organization and Management section.
 
If you don’t know how to prepare income statements, balance sheets, and 
cash-flow statements, get an accountant to help you. To be as accurate as 
possible, develop a detailed list of expenses and budgets, brainstorming as 
many details as possible, so that you’re able to build up overall expense 
projections from very specific guesses about component costs.
Many business plans include an analysis of the financial statements, with 
ratios and trends identified, much as a stock analyst might do in examining a 
major public corporation.
 
If you’re planning to approach a bank for a Small Business Administration 
(SBA) loan, check its requirements for financial statements and exhibits. See 
the checklist of required papers at www.sba.gov/tools/Forms/small 
businessforms/fsforms/index.html, or contact the nearest SBA district 
office by phone for help. (For locations and contact information for all offices, 
see www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html).

305
 Chapter 18: Building a Business Around Your Innovation
Prepare an appendix of 
supporting documents
The appendix is an optional — but in my opinion extremely useful — part of 
a business plan. If you’re using your plan primarily to raise funding (whether 
via loans, a line of credit, or equity investments), the appendix should 
include documents that support your funding request by showing that 
you’re financially responsible and qualified to run a business and handle its 
finances. Exhibits for the appendix may include
 
✓ Credit histories for key members of the management team and for the 
business itself if it has been around long enough to have one
 
✓ Résumés and letters of reference for key members of the management team
 
✓ Documentation of relevant patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses, 
building permits, operating permits, leases, or contracts
 
✓ Plans, diagrams, schematics, or photographs of facilities, processes, or 
products described within the plan
 
✓ Copies of supporting research documents, such as articles or studies
 
✓ Records such as photographs and testimonials showing the results of 
field tests or customer reactions
You can think of a good business plan as being a presentation of your business 
concept involving both “show” and “tell” elements. The main body of the plan 
tells your story in words and numbers, leaving the appendix to illustrate the 
story. Use the flexibility of the appendix to full advantage by including as many 
supporting and illustrative documents as you can. A business plan of 25 pages 
with a 30-page appendix is a potential winner because it’s just long enough to 
provide detail without being unreadably long, and it has a convincing amount 
of supporting material in its appendix.
Funding Your Innovative Venture
The majority of business startups are financed informally by people who 
are directly involved in the business themselves or have relatives who are. 
The initial investments are usually modest, as are the businesses. New retail 
stores, home-based crafts producers or importers, and small firms specializing 
in equipment leasing are examples of the millions of small businesses that 
are started every year. How are they financed, and how well do they do?
You’ve probably heard that more than half of all new businesses fail in the 
first year. You may also have heard that successful new ventures have to 
apply to venture-capital firms — companies that raise large pools of private 
funding for entrepreneurial investments. Both beliefs are wrong.

306
Part IV: Implementing a Major Innovation 
The failure rate is better than people think, but not stellar. Only a quarter of 
new businesses fail in the first year. It takes four years for half of them to fail. 
After ten years, only a third remain standing, according to Scott Shane, a 
professor of entrepreneurship at Case Western Reserve University, who 
tracked a sample of startups over a ten-year period.
It’s also untrue that venture capital funds most startups. Venture-capital 
firms provide larger investments than individual investors do, and they’re 
often involved in the most newsworthy ventures, so they tend to seem more 
important than they really are. If you’re starting a small, local business, you 
won’t qualify for venture capital. However, if you’re starting a business based 
on an innovation that has the potential for national or international success, 
it makes sense to ask venture capitalists to review your plan. You just might 
be a good match for one of them.
Pairing up with venture capitalists
Venture-capital firms generally seek to make investments of between 
$250,000 and $1.5 million, and they like to invest in businesses that aren’t 
brand new, because a few years of demonstrated growth makes the investment 
far less risky for them. They look for entrepreneurs who have stellar résumés 
(high-level management or technical experience in the industry) and an 
innovation that promises to produce explosive growth in the next five to 
seven years. If your business doesn’t fit this profile, don’t bother trying to 
approach venture-capital firms.
You can locate venture-capital funds by asking a friendly stockbroker to find 
out what funds have been actively raising capital in recent months (indicating 
that they have new funding to invest). At the time of this writing, however, 
fund-raising by venture-capital firms is at an historic low, with only a few 
actively recruiting investors. As the economy regains strength, this number 
should rise back to a few dozen or more a year.
Plenty of venture-capital funds aren’t actively raising money right now but 
may have money to invest. Locate them by attending regional events sponsored 
by an association of venture capitalists in your area. In the United States, 
contact the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA; www.nvca.org) 
for an up-to-date listing of regional organizations. Some of these groups hold 
occasional events in which entrepreneurs are invited to present brief 
summaries of their plans and get to meet potential investors.
 
Generally, the best way to locate lists of venture-capital firms is through 
published sources. Most fund-raisers have to resort to published directories 
in books such as Directory of Venture Capital, by Kate Lister and Tom Harnish 
(Wiley), or The Directory of Venture Capital & Private Equity Firms (Grey House 
Publishing) for master lists with contact information.

307
 Chapter 18: Building a Business Around Your Innovation
 
Lots of firms offer to help entrepreneurs find venture-capital financing. These 
intermediaries or middlemen usually live off the fees they charge entrepreneurs, 
and in my experience, they rarely provide much value for the money. A real 
venture-capital fund won’t charge you to apply. It may treat you impolitely, 
keeping you at arm’s length and not taking your anxious calls to see whether 
anyone has read your plan, because the firm probably reviews thousands of 
plans a year. As long as the firm doesn’t charge you a large reading fee or 
other consulting fees, however, and simply agrees to add your plan to its pile 
for review, it probably is legitimate.
Avoid the many other firms that advertise or blog actively on the Web and are 
looking to make a quick buck from entrepreneurs instead of actually funding 
them. A good rule of thumb is to stay away if a firm wants you to pay upfront. 
Legitimate investors and their agents don’t impose upfront fees for services.
Locating angel investors
Angel investors are wealthy people who make direct investments in startups 
and growing businesses. You can locate them through brokers or financial 
managers who provide high-end, customized wealth management services or 
through personal networking. Ask around; make everyone you know aware of 
your startup and any investment opportunities that it presents. Lawyers may 
also be a good source of referrals.
Some Web-based services say that they connect entrepreneurs with angel 
investors. I’m not sure how well this approach works, but as long as you’re 
not spending money on the Web search, I suppose that it’s worth trying. 
Check out businesses such as FundingPost (www.fundingpost.com) to get 
a feel for this option.
Compared with venture-capital firms, angel investors often look for smaller, 
earlier-stage investments. An investment of between $25,000 and $150,000 is 
about right for most angels. In exchange, they will want you to be incorporated 
or to establish a formal partnership with them, and they’ll need legal papers 
giving them clear control of a portion of your firm. You’ll have to negotiate 
with them to determine what valuation makes sense. If you’re not making 
any money, no matter how exciting your innovation is, you’re probably stuck 
with a low business valuation and may have to give up 10 percent to 50 percent 
of your equity in exchange for your first major infusion of funding (about the 
same percentage a venture-capital firm would take).
An experienced angel investor has probably worked with dozens of entrepreneurs 
and will bring a professional eye to your business plan, which is helpful. Look for 
an angel who can offer not only funding but also relevant management or board-
level experience and who will be an asset to your board of directors.

Get a good lawyer to review your contract with an angel investor. Such an 
investor will have a good lawyer (if not, don’t do business with him!), and you 
should, too.
Obtaining loans
The thing about debt is that it has to be serviced monthly and eventually 
repaid. If you currently have a positive cash flow for your venture and can 
afford to make the payments on a bank note or credit line, perhaps it’s okay 
to apply for debt. Many entrepreneurial ventures, however, aren’t far enough 
along to service debt reliably. Ideally, the lenders realize this situation and 
won’t allow you to borrow enough money to get into trouble, but if they 
aren’t wise enough to say no, you should be cautious yourself.
If you do have reliable and growing profits, you can apply to your bank or 
other banks in your community. Speak to a lending officer to see what 
products the bank has that might match your needs. If you’re not quite 
established enough to get a bank loan, the SBA may be able to help you with a 
loan guarantee. Your banker should know about this option and how to apply.
Selling Your Inventions
Professional inventors generate good ideas at a faster rate than other people 
do. They’re also good at refining ideas into viable inventions that they 
document clearly and well and at filing well-prepared patent applications 
that have a high success rate.
Sometimes, inventors build businesses based on their patents, but most 
inventors license their patents to established businesses. A license arrange-
ment gives the licensee the right to use the licensor’s patent in exchange for 
an upfront fee and a small share of profits. Licenses may be exclusive (no 
other licensees are allowed) or nonexclusive. Exclusivity makes sense when 
the licensee will have to invest in development and production before sales 
can commence.
If a product’s patent is broadly applicable, the inventor may offer narrow 
exclusivity to a licensee for a specific application but reserve the right to sign 
up other licensees for other applications. The goal is to make sure that a well-
qualified company is selling your invention in a market that it understands.

Ten Creative Ways to 
Boost Your Career

C
reativity is the secret ingredient in highly successful careers. A lot of 
famous people have used creativity to advance their careers more 
rapidly than others around them. Here are ten good ways to make your mark 
as an innovator and leader among your peers.
Look for Opportunities to Stand Out
Ordinary careers are made up of consistent performances, year after year. 
Consistency is a good way to keep your job, but it doesn’t help you get 
ahead. Exceptional careers are made of breakthrough performances — 
memorable problems or situations in which you’ve played leading roles.
To stand out, look for a tough challenge, a difficult assignment, or a new pro-
gram or invention that needs a champion to be implemented. Be the person 
who steps up and wrestles with the problem or opportunity of the month 
or year. Be a volunteer and a risk-taker. Tackle something that might really 
make a difference. A certain amount of boldness is necessary if you want to 
do anything that will be remembered.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Share Your Enthusiasm 
for Innovative Ideas
Many people assume that it’s inappropriate to talk about new ideas and 
approaches in the workplace. After all, most people around you don’t, so 
why should you? It might make you seem like a troublemaker or malcontent, 
right? Wrong. Many people secretly wish that things would improve in their 
workplaces and have private complaints and concerns about how things are 
done. They welcome someone who has fresh ideas and a positive attitude 
toward innovation. Just so long as their own necks aren’t sticking out, they’re 
happy to see someone else propose new ideas.
 
It’s better to be the employee who suggests new approaches than any of the 
timid people who don’t have the courage to propose an idea or point out the 
flaws in everyday procedures. Just make sure that you aren’t too strident. 
Recognize that the majority of good ideas get shot down. Even ideas that get 
adopted have usually been shot down a few dozen times before they finally 
take hold, so be good humored about the process, and don’t get mad if people 
are slow to recognize that you’re right. A patient innovator is a successful and 
popular innovator. An impatient innovator is destined to work alone.
Look for Emerging Problems 
You Can Help Solve
It feels good to be part of a team that figures out how to resolve a major 
problem. Have the courage to dive headfirst into the most troubling area in 
your field, and be one of the leaders who innovates to improve it. The only 
caveat is that you need to pick your place of work carefully. Look for like-
minded people in a situation where there’s enthusiasm for change so that 
you don’t feel hampered by traditional, narrow-minded thinkers.
Take, for example, the shortage of primary-care (general-practice) medical 
practitioners in the United States. This shortage is an artifact of the cost-
saving pressures applied by the insurance industry, which have turned 
primary care into a race to see a new patient every 15 minutes and then to 
squeeze enough procedures into the visit to make it profitable for the medical 
practice. Many doctors and nurse practitioners are turned off by general 
practice and have gravitated toward specialties in which they make more 
money and have more control of the way they practice medicine.
It’s smart to avoid a problematic area — or is it? Somewhere, some medi-
cal practice is going to solve the problems of primary care and create a new 
model that spreads across the country. The doctors who innovate to resolve 

313
 Chapter 19: Ten Creative Ways to Boost Your Career
the major issues of primary care will be seen as leaders in the field of medicine, 
and they’ll have rewarding careers.
Look for Emerging Opportunities 
You Can Surf
Another way to be a winner is to jump on a wave that’s gaining strength and 
looks like it will be one of the big ones that transforms society. You may find 
that you face a few years of uncertainty and slow growth by trying to position 
yourself in the vanguard of an emerging field. It’s hard to know exactly when 
an industry will take off. Many people today have spent decades struggling 
to turn solar power into a major industry that replaces fossil fuel. I think that 
they’re right, conceptually, but I’m not sure whether this will be their decade. 
My advice is to pick an emerging field that you’re excited about and really 
believe in so that you’ll have the satisfaction of doing meaningful work while 
you wait for your chance to become a billionaire.
 
My great-grandfather, Edwin S. Webster, and his business partner, Charles 
A. Stone, met at registration in the beginning of their freshman year at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both were intrigued by the emerging 
field of electrical engineering and decided to major in it. They were the first 
two graduates with degrees in this new major, back in 1888. The next year, 
because no firms were hiring electrical engineers at that time, they founded 
a testing laboratory and consulting firm in Boston called Stone and Webster. 
Their timing was impeccable. Within ten years, the firm was doing major 
projects all around the country, and it played a leading role as electrical plants, 
trolley systems, and streetlights were introduced in cities throughout the 
world. My great-grandfather was a smart guy who focused his career on an 
emerging field and put his considerable energy and enthusiasm into growing it.
Do Something You Really Enjoy
There’s a strong link between creative thinking and doing, on one hand, and 
happiness on the other. Unhappy people don’t do very much or very good 
creative work; they worry rather than imagine. Now apply this principle to 
your career. How are you going to do your best work and contribute innova-
tive ideas to your workplace and profession? Certainly not by being unhappy 
and stressed in your work!
 
What interests you? What was your favorite summer job when you were a 
kid? What are your top hobbies? These sorts of questions help you zero in on 
the field or profession that you’re most likely to make a mark in. It may seem 
to be less economically promising to focus on, say, knitting compared with 

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
accounting, but if you do accounting just to pay the bills and really love 
knitting, perhaps a shift of careers is overdue.
Start thinking about how to create a role for yourself in the world based on 
a genuine interest, and when you’ve figured out how to meet your minimum 
economic requirements in that field, make the switch! If you’re midway into 
a dull career and have a bunch of dependents and a costly mortgage, it may 
take some years to figure out how to switch careers to something you really 
love, so you’ll need a long-term plan with a lot of innovative thinking and 
entrepreneurship along the way. But even if it’s for five or ten years, having 
a plan feels great. It took me ten years out of college to cement my plans to 
make a living as an author, but now I’m glad that I persisted in moving in that 
direction, because I love the work.
Consider Working on Commission
Careers that are based on sales commissions include real estate, investment 
banking, automobile sales, industrial-equipment leasing, commercial lending, 
insurance, and business to business sales. People who work in these careers 
are responsible for drumming up enough business to earn their own incomes, 
making them basically entrepreneurs who build personal business networks, 
often under the umbrella of some larger company. A real estate agent, for 
example, may do her own marketing and build her own roster of satisfied 
customers while working in a real estate company’s office and competing 
against the other agents there.
Why work on commission? Most commission-based jobs leave you more 
freedom to pursue sales your own way so long as you produce. The autonomy 
of commission-based work is great for self-directed, motivated people who 
are eager to experiment with different approaches until they find a success 
formula that works for them. It’s true that the average entry-level salesperson 
doesn’t make much in the way of commissions and may give up after a year 
or two to take a “safer” job. But you’re not average! The top-performing sales-
people in many industries are able to build successful careers, first within 
the boundaries of a firm’s sales force and later by going out on their own and 
creating their own real estate firm, sales-rep company, or other venture. (See 
Chapter 18 for tips on successful entrepreneurship.)
Build Two Careers at the Same Time
Some people have double majors in college, and some people have double 
careers. Having two careers means working two jobs, so it may not be 
appealing as a career strategy at first, but building two parallel career paths 
has many benefits:

315
 Chapter 19: Ten Creative Ways to Boost Your Career
 
✓ Two career tracks in different industries or fields expose you to many 
more opportunities than a single career path does.
 
✓ A shadow career (something that you do in your extra time, such as on 
weekends or in the evenings) often grows over time to become your 
primary activity, especially if it’s the thing you most enjoy doing.
 
✓ By working in multiple fields or professions, you gain a breadth of 
experience and knowledge that allows you to see creative combinations 
and options that other people don’t.
Study
Nothing educates the mind like education, to coin a redundant phrase. Before 
my own career took off fully, I used to have enough time to teach regularly 
in business schools in my area, and my favorite gig was teaching an evening 
or weekend MBA class, because my students were working adults who had 
decided to come back to school for an advanced degree. Adult learners are 
fun to teach because they’re . . . well, adult! They have experience, motivation, 
and discipline that they probably lacked in their teen years. Many of my 
students from that period are now leaders in their fields, and a surprising 
number have made it as entrepreneurs.
But wait — why is that surprising? To be a successful entrepreneur, you need 
to be self-directed, motivated, and disciplined, and you need enough real-
world experience to be able to imagine useful innovations. Add some new 
ways of thinking and a little mental training, and you’ve produced a recipe for 
innovators who will rise to the top.
I highly recommend going back to study something that you think will be 
useful or interesting. If you’re already in school, take a course in a different 
department to add breadth to your studies. If you haven’t been in a class-
room for a while, sign up for a course at the nearest community college, 
or if you can’t find a conveniently located classroom, take a course online. 
Your studies may not turn into a full-fledged degree program, but either way, 
taking classes will enrich your thinking and power up some parts of your 
brain that may not have had enough exercise lately.
Volunteer
Whether you’re taking a tough work assignment that nobody else wants or 
helping a homeless shelter raise funds, volunteering can have a big effect on 
you and your career.
Volunteering is a great way to build confidence and get practice in problem-
solving, leadership, and innovation. It often involves working with teams, so 

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
it strengthens your communication and facilitation skills. Also, when you offer 
your efforts for free, it’s amazing how many doors open to you that might have 
stayed closed if you were looking for paid work. Volunteering is a great way 
to get some experience in a new field that interests you or that you think may 
someday be combined with your own field of work for a future innovation. 
Take a look around, and see what you can volunteer for right now that would 
enrich your own working life at the same time that it helps other people.
Champion Someone Else’s Good Idea
To be a leading innovator, do you have to be the one who comes up with the 
next big idea? No, that’s not true at all. Many people make their mark as leaders 
in their fields by embracing a great idea early, before other people realize its 
qualities, and championing its development.
There’s a time window — often a really big one — between invention and 
rapid spread. During that period, an innovation may stagnate or spread very 
slowly, as early adopters try to get the kinks out and make it work. The idea 
of electronic medical records, for example, was around for several years 
before it began to gain traction in actual medical practices. During that time, 
a few innovators saw the potential for digitizing medical records and began 
to try to make it work. Some of their efforts failed, but others emerged as 
industry standards. I wish that I’d been involved in one of the successful 
companies supplying medical-records systems, because they’ve found a fast-
growing market niche and can hardly supply the demand.
Take a look around your industry or workplace, or in one of the fields in 
which you volunteer or do part-time work. Does someone have a really good 
idea or invention that just hasn’t caught on yet? Start studying it. Experiment 
with it in your own work. Blog about it. Go to industry conferences, and lead 
discussion groups about how to make it work. Being an early champion of 
someone else’s breakthrough idea is a great role, and without such champions, 
many innovations would fail to catch on.

Ten Tips for More 
Innovative Meetings
In This Chapter
▶ Turning ordinary meetings into extraordinary innovation sessions
▶ Finding time for creative problem-solving
▶ Getting everyone involved in the thought process
D
o you like meetings? In surveys, almost all people say that they dislike 
the meetings they have to attend in their workplaces. As a consequence, 
meetings are shorter and fewer than they were in earlier decades. Besides, 
everyone’s so busy that they have precious little time to talk. They need to 
stay at their desks, cranking out work that was due yesterday.
Fewer face-to-face meetings, however, mean that far fewer innovative ideas 
come up, because many of the best ideas arise in discussions at meetings. 
The best solution to the I-hate-meetings syndrome is to run better meetings 
rather than cut back on them. This chapter contains ten tips for making 
meetings count toward your monthly quota of brilliant breakthroughs.
Ask for Original Information and Ideas
Questions such as these help open a meeting to creative ideas and insights:
 
✓ “What else could we think about before deciding what to do?”
 
✓ “Are there any fresh ideas or suggestions?”
 
✓ “Does anyone know anything that we haven’t discussed yet or have new 
information or a different viewpoint?”
Challenging the group to come up with fresh ideas or new sources of information 
almost guarantees increased creative thinking. You have a variety of human 
minds sitting around the table; use them fully by asking each person to make 
a unique contribution to your meeting. Nodding doesn’t count.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Reorganize Your Meetings, 
Not Your Staff
How many times have you seen something like this in the business news?: 
“XYZ Co. announced that it is reorganizing its Z division and consolidating the 
A, B, and C departments into a new strategic business unit reporting directly 
to the chief executive officer.” Behind every such announcement smacking of 
redrawn organizational charts is a performance problem that made the CEO 
think she needed to pay more attention to the A, B, and C departments (or 
wherever the problem happened to be). Reorganization only helps if disorgani-
zation is the root cause of the performance problem, however, and it rarely is.
 
The next time you or your boss starts talking about redrawing the organization 
chart to solve some problem, suggest holding a problem-solving meeting instead. 
Run it as a straight-ahead, no-politics session with freewheeling generation of 
any and all possible ideas and solutions. See what comes up. You’ll probably get 
a better, less drastic solution than redrawing the organization chart.
Re-solve Old Problems
It’s a great exercise to dredge up old problems and revisit them. One problem 
per staff meeting and a limit of ten minutes are good rules for keeping this 
exercise from overstepping its bounds. Hindsight often reveals a better way to 
solve a problem, and it’s interesting to see what improvements you can make on 
the old solution. Sometimes, you end up discarding the previous solution and 
replacing it with a far better solution. Now, that’s a productive use of meeting 
time! It also signals something essential to creative enthusiasm and the innova-
tive spirit: Nothing’s carved in stone, and a better idea is always welcome.
 
A software company in Palo Alto, California, faced a shortage of parking for 
visitors. It solved the problem by requiring lower-level staff members to park 
off-site (across the street at a commercial lot or in any spaces available at 
meters along the street). Also, all senior staff members were required to park 
in the back of the parking lot and leave the best spaces next to the door free 
for visitors. Problem solved. But was the solution the best solution?
Forcing lower-level staff members to pay to park on the street was a major 
sore point that hurt morale — an unintended negative consequence of the 
plan. A better idea came up in a staff meeting later: Rotate access to the 
limited spaces in the company lot among all staff members. Also, someone 
pointed out that the visitor spaces weren’t needed most days and that the 
company rarely held a large enough gathering to require them all for visitors. 
It would be perfectly feasible to anticipate days when all the spaces were 
needed and days when only a few would have to be blocked off for drop-by 

319
 Chapter 20: Ten Tips for More Innovative Meetings
visitors. Staff members whose turn it was to park on the street could use the 
open visitor spaces on a first-come basis. With these two changes, the parking 
situation seemed to be more under control, and morale went up.
Use a “Sideways Thoughts” Board
An old-fashioned military acronym, TBDL, used to mean to be decided later. 
I’ve attended some meetings in which a chart pad or section of a chalkboard 
was designated as the TBDL area, where people could write notes about 
questions or suggestions that didn’t fit the agenda item being discussed. It’s 
a good idea and should be done more often. The meeting needs to stay on 
topic to cover each agenda item, but discussions often raise other thoughts 
and questions that deserve discussion time too.
When I use this technique, I set up a chart pad with Sideways Thoughts written 
across the top of the page. Sideways thoughts — those ideas and questions 
that arise through association during discussion of a main agenda item — are 
well worth capturing and reviewing later for insights that could lead to future 
innovations. (I don’t use TBDL because I don’t like to limit the list to decisions. 
Usually, the most productive sideways thoughts are questions or suggestions, 
not formal decisions that need to be made.)
Pay Close Attention to Body Language
When you meet around a table in a conference room, as people so often do 
in workplaces, you have an opportunity to tune into body language, which 
expresses things that verbal and written communications don’t. The most 
important messages embedded in body language are emotions — how you 
feel about yourself, other people, and the topics of conversation. Usually, 
people are unconscious of their nonverbal messages, but if you pay attention 
to posture, facial expression, and tone of voice, you can become a student of 
body language and then use it to draw more and better information and ideas 
from those who are attending the meeting with you.
Avoid making these all-too-common body-language errors at business meetings:
 
✓ Withdrawal is signaled by leaning back, facing away from the person 
who’s talking, and by doing things like texting or reading while others 
are talking. It sends a strong message that you’re not interested in 
the topic and also may be interpreted as saying that you don’t like or 
respect the other people in the meeting. Withdrawal behavior shuts 
down creative discussion and prevents people from speaking their 
minds or sharing all their information.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Contraction is signaled by looking down, bowing the head, drooping the 
shoulders, and slumping. It sends the signal that you’re depressed or 
secretly defiant and makes people think that you’re not onboard or part 
of the team.
 
✓ Expansion is signaled by expanding the chest, leaning back, holding the 
back straight and head up, and sometimes by raising the shoulders. It 
sends a strong message that you think you’re superior to others and don’t 
care what they think. It’s associated with high status and arrogance.
When you’ve familiarized yourself with the three nonverbal postures that 
prevent innovation in meetings, it’s time to master approach — the behavior 
that boosts innovative discussions and stimulates free and open sharing 
of information and ideas. Approach is signaled by leaning forward slightly, 
squaring up to face the person speaking, and making a fair amount of eye 
contact with the speaker. You can also nod or use encouraging short phrases 
such as “Okay,” “Uh-huh,” “Interesting,” and “What else?” to keep the flow of 
discussion going.
Approach signals interest in the speaker and the topic. Without the subtle 
encouragement of approach behaviors, people don’t speak freely in meetings. 
Whether you’re in the boss’s seat at the head of the table or holding down 
one of the other seats around it, you should use approach behaviors to 
encourage whoever is offering a contribution to the meeting. That way, 
people will feel encouraged to contribute their thoughts.
If you’re interested in reading more about nonverbal behavior and com-
munication, I recommend the classic book on the topic, Albert Mehrabian’s 
Nonverbal Communication (Aldine Transaction).
Control Routine Topics Tightly
The problem with many meetings is that they wander off topic and waste 
time on trivialities. If you want to go over the week’s progress, by all means 
do — but make sure that each person’s progress report is brief and to the 
point. Limit individual reports to two minutes or less. (Handouts can be used 
if there’s too much information for a brief review.) Keep questions relevant 
and brief, and don’t let anyone grandstand by talking at length during the 
progress review.
Many of the topics on meeting agendas can be handled with discipline and 
focus. Most topics are best handled with a fairly high level of control so as to 
keep the meeting on track and prevent anyone from wasting others’ time. A 
tightly run meeting gets through its agenda quickly, much to the relief of the 
attendees. Allow extra time for low-structure discussion of any interesting 
topics that may be on your mind or that have been posted to the Sideways 
Thoughts board (refer to the earlier section “Use a ‘Sideways Thoughts’ 
Board”) during the structured part of the meeting.

321
 Chapter 20: Ten Tips for More Innovative Meetings
 
Schedule 50-minute meetings with 30 minutes’ worth of agenda items to allow for 
20 minutes of creative thinking at the end. Use the time to brainstorm about a 
problem or opportunity, or simply open the floor for general discussion and see 
what interesting ideas or problems come up. By covering your agenda items 
promptly and with discipline, you leave plenty of time for creative discussion 
during the meeting. This facilitation method of tight followed by loose takes care 
of today’s business and also allows innovative thinking about the future.
Control or Exclude Spoilers
Spoilers are those people who rain on your creative parade. They come in 
various flavors:
 
✓ Difficult people who complain and demand all the attention during 
a meeting
 
✓ Self-styled experts who always shoot down ideas and insist that they’re 
the only ones who know what will work
 
✓ Contrarians who like to argue and debate and who leap to criticize new 
ideas before they’ve even been fully formed
 
✓ Pessimists who grumble and like to share their bad news
It takes only one spoiler to ruin a meeting and make most of the other people 
withdraw. It’s really, really hard to generate good ideas or do creative 
problem-solving with a spoiler at the table. That’s why you have to insist that 
the spoiler stop his spoiling behavior at once. If not, get the person out of 
the meeting as soon as possible, and don’t invite him to the next one. (Yes, 
appropriate meeting behavior should be part of employee job descriptions so 
that incurable spoilers can eventually be fired.)
Brainstorm at Least Once a Month
How often should you stop and think about your work instead of just doing 
it? The answer depends on the level of innovation you need or want to 
achieve, but the range is somewhere between once a day and once a month. 
If you hold fewer than a dozen brainstorming sessions a year, you’re really 
not making even the minimum commitment to innovation. It’s all well and 
good to study innovation and know how to facilitate creative groups, but the 
point is that you actually have to use the techniques in this book, not just 
read about them.
I can’t find any surveys showing how often the average business asks its 
employees to participate in a full-blown idea-generation or brainstorming 
session, but in my own experience of visiting hundreds of workplaces, I’m 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
sorry to say that I don’t think the average employee is asked for ideas more 
than once a year at best. Ramp it up, guys! If we don’t ask ourselves and our 
co-workers and employees to imagine a better future, we won’t create one.
Ask for Multiple Alternatives
Regardless of the topic of a meeting, there’s almost always a decision to be 
discussed. Some bosses just announce their decisions, preferring an autocratic 
style. (But what style do employees like? A more participative one, of course.)
To get better input for decision-making, use meetings to generate three to 
five viable alternatives. Then examine the pros and cons of each alternative 
and make your selection. The result is bound to be better than the first option 
that sprang to mind, and by including the group in your thinking process, 
you’ve used the meeting to generate buy-in as well as better decisions.
Meet Somewhere New and Different
If the weather’s good, take your group to the lawn in front of your building (if 
there is one) or to the nearest park for a brown-bag lunch and informal staff 
meeting. Or hold your meeting in the private dining room of a local restaurant 
and treat everyone to a company lunch. If a restaurant doesn’t fit your needs 
or budget, look for a different location within your own company, such as a 
large conference room or one with a better table than where you usually meet.
The idea behind changing your venue is that the environment influences the 
mood of the group and may be used to loosen up people’s thinking and 
encourage creative expression. A fun or attractive environment stimulates free 
thinking. A fancy, formal environment signals that the meeting is special and its 
subject is an important one. A meeting on the shop floor or in the warehouse 
signals that you want everyone to roll up their sleeves and work on the details 
of a production or other process. Adjust the environment to fit your agenda 
and signal the kind of participation you expect from those present.

ow do you come up with really brilliant ideas when and where they’re 
needed? If you can do that, you can do anything. Doors open to those who 
have better ideas. And it feels good — no, great — to be the author of a break-
through business strategy or the inventor of a great new product or process.
But how can you power up your creative genius and produce more and 
better big ideas? Here are ten tips that range from specific practices you can 
try to lifelong habits you may want to adopt.
Persist, Persist, Persist
Are geniuses born or made? Talent, we assume, appears early in life. Child 
prodigies are so remarkably brilliant that they receive special recognition 
from the beginning and grow up into leading thinkers, composers, or 
athletes, just as their proud parents and the rest of society expects them to. 
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart began composing at the age of 5, history tells us. 
What were you doing at the age of 5?
We don’t listen to or perform Mozart’s early compositions, however; we 
know him for his mature work. It was the fact that he loved music from an 
early age that explains why he was an excellent performer in his teens and 
composed really great work in his 20s. He had, by virtue of his love of music 
and the support of his musical family, devoted more than a decade to

us is that practice makes perfect, and talent is a relatively minor contributor to 
the success stories of leading scientists, musicians, athletes, artists, 
entrepreneurs, and inventors.
The trick is to focus, practice, and learn — persistently and for a fairly long 
time. It takes time to become a sudden success. Lots of time. Thomas Edison 
invented a light-bulb filament that wouldn’t burn out right away through 
the simple but tedious process of testing every material he could think of. 
He performed hundreds of unsuccessful tests, more than anyone else, so he 
learned more about how different materials performed and eventually hit on 
the right one.
Have faith in your own potential for creative genius! By persisting where 
others give up, you can and probably will find a better solution to a problem, 
or a better design or invention. It’s the persistent people whom history 
recalls as having been geniuses. Heck, if your ideas are important enough, 
people may even make up stories about your amazing early talent — whether 
you actually exhibited any or not.
Work on BIG Problems
Most people spend most of their time solving small problems and ticking items 
off endless to-do lists. A working life ruled by details is all well and good, but it 
doesn’t add up to any breakthroughs. Take time — at least one day a week — 
to focus on something big. That’s the biggest secret of successful innovators. 
They elbow aside the mundane and routine stuff and actually find time to 
focus on something major, such as
 
✓ A big question, like how to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, 
how to prevent breast cancer, or how to modernize an old family 
business to give it growth potential for the new generation
 
✓ A big problem, like how to turn around a failing business or what to do 
with an empty old warehouse or factory on the edge of town
 
✓ A big opportunity, like how to contribute to the challenging goal of 
making airports and airplanes more secure from terrorist attacks
Major questions, problems, and opportunities are the stuff of creative genius 
for the simple reason that if you contribute solutions, you will be hailed as a 
hero, not just given your cost-of-living increase.
If you’re not focusing on anything big, you’re wasting your creative energy 
entirely on the little things of life. I agree that little things do matter; it’s helpful 
to remember to buy dog food and diapers on the way home from work, or 
to pay your electric bill before the power company shuts the power off. But 
little things don’t add up to anything big; they just add up to a long to-do list. 
Remember to take the time to focus on something big too.

I don’t like shopping lists, because I view chores as getting in the way of more 
important thinking and work, but sometimes I have to sally forth with a shopping 
list. Here’s something you can do to make grocery (or any) shopping more 
productive: At the bottom of every list, add a big question you want to think 
about, and then think about it as you walk through the aisles, filling your cart. 
I don’t know how many trips to the grocery store it will take you to get a 
breakthrough idea, but I do know that, eventually, you’ll come up with 
something good.
Rotate Among Three Knotty Problems
Challenge yourself with not one, not two, but three major puzzles or problems at 
the same time. See whether you can invent three better products, processes, 
or solutions. This advice may seem counterintuitive, because it’s hard 
enough to crack just one tough innovation puzzle, but you increase your 
chances of having a breakthrough idea by working on several main problems 
simultaneously. Research and think about one topic until you feel stale or at 
a dead end; then set the folder aside and turn to the next one. When you get 
stuck on it, go to the third and then back to the first.
Being able to set a tough problem aside for a while helps you be persistent. 
Another benefit of rotating among three problems is that you increase the 
chances of having a breakthrough by a factor of three. If you solve even 
one of them, you’ll have a good invention or solution in hand that you can 
work on implementing. The third benefit of this approach is that you often 
get cross-fertilization of ideas; your work on one problem can enrich your 
approach to another.
Pick problems or puzzles that would benefit from an innovation, but don’t 
necessarily feel that you have to make a breakthrough right away. That way, 
you can take your time and wait for an “aha” idea.
Most inventors use this technique of rotating among multiple puzzles or 
problems. They may give the impression that they’re always completing a 
project, but actually, they’re harvesting the ones that bore fruit and abandoning 
others that didn’t. Give yourself some flexibility by looking into more than 
one puzzle, problem, or possible invention, and pushing ahead on whichever 
one seems to be moving forward most easily.
Eat Ideas for Lunch
Try this procedure for working out a solution to a problem or coming up with 
a clever idea to take advantage of an opportunity:

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
1. Invite a creative friend to lunch at a diner or other informal restaurant 
where scribbling ideas on a large pad of paper won’t elicit too 
many stares.
 
2. Explain the ground rules to your friend: You’re both to brainstorm 
about the topic of your choice, and you have to suggest an idea to 
earn the right to take a bite.
 
3. Order sandwiches or salads, because hot entrees may grow cold 
before you fill your pad with ideas!
You’ll need to pick up the tab, of course, but in exchange, you get a brain-
storming partner for however long it takes to fill a piece of paper with ideas 
and eat your lunch. If you don’t follow this three-step process, you’ll find 
yourself chatting with your friend about other things and forgetting to focus 
on the brainstorming topic. That’s why you have to establish, and follow, 
a strict idea-for-a-bite rule!
What if you get through your sandwiches and still don’t have the break-
through idea you need? There’s only one thing to do: Order dessert.
Work on Your Self-Talk
Those little voices inside your own head determine success and failure to a 
large extent. You’re not crazy to listen to them; in fact, that’s the sanest thing 
you can do. Pay special attention to the way you explain notable events to 
yourself. Notable events are, generally speaking, either notably good or bad.
If you think about bad events as being your fault, you’re setting yourself up 
for pessimism and blocking your creative genius. Watch out for self-blaming, 
and if you start to do it, make a point of listing the external factors that con-
tributed to a bad event. Rather than blame yourself entirely for having an 
automobile accident, for example, remind yourself that it was dark and icy, 
that the roads hadn’t been properly sanded, and that the other driver was 
going way too fast.
Watch out for overgeneralizing a bad event too; that tendency also depresses 
your creative impulse. Rather than conclude that you “can’t manage money 
well” after investing in a retirement fund that does poorly, tell yourself some-
thing productive like “I won’t repeat the specific investment strategy I used in 
that case, because it didn’t work well.”
When it comes to good events, do the opposite: Generalize, and take the 
credit! Yes, you’re brilliant; that’s why you made that big sale. And if you can 
make one big sale, you can make many. You have the potential to be the top 
salesperson in your entire industry! This kind of positive self-talk actually 
does help increase your optimism and drive, giving you energy for creative 
problem-solving.

327
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Stimulate Your Creative Genius
Creativity and innovation are tightly tied to mood. Hopefulness and optimism 
produce innovation. Work on your state of mind first, and the innovative 
behavior you want will naturally follow.
For more information on how to get your self-talk right, see Martin Seligman’s 
classic books Learned Helplessness and Learned Optimism (Knopf Doubleday) 
and his summary of his findings, Authentic Happiness (Simon & Schuster), or 
do the exercises in the “Transforming Negative Talk” booklet, available at 
Trainer’s Spectrum (www.tspectrum.com/communication_negtalk.htm).
Correct Your Mental Biases
It’s hard to see problems and projects 100 percent clearly when you’re 
human (which I assume that all my readers are). Humans have these big 
brains that are good at thinking but have some curious blind spots built into 
them. We have certain biases that lead us to make incorrect assumptions. 
Here are some of the biggest and most persistent mental biases:
 
✓ The belief that correlation implies causation: If two things are associated 
or occur together, we naturally assume that one is causing the other.
 
 If people who smoke cigarettes also tend to suffer from heart disease, 
for example, we leap to the conclusion that smoking causes heart 
disease and that to prevent heart disease, people need to stop smoking. 
In fact, research partially confirms this conclusion; smoking does 
increase the risk of heart disease. But it’s not the root cause, and if we 
focus only on preventing smoking, we’ll never eliminate all heart disease. 
More to the point, it might be productive to ask, “Could something be 
causing both smoking and heart disease?” In other words, what if you 
look for a third factor that drives the first two?
 
 If you apply this thinking to the example of heart disease and smoking, 
you might find that certain kinds of stress cause heart disease, which 
might get you thinking about ways to reduce or manage stress as part 
of a public-health strategy. Perhaps it would be more effective to help 
people manage their stress than to focus on creating an antismoking 
campaign. Nobody’s doing that, however, probably because the mental 
bias to see correlation as causation is a strong one.
 
✓ The tendency to satisfice: Satisficing (a term coined by 1978 Nobel laureate 
in economics, Herbert Simon) means to make a hasty choice among 
alternatives instead of looking more systematically for an ideal option. 
When people shop for apartments, for example, they often satisfice by 
signing a lease for a place that has some of the qualities they wanted 
but not all. Why don’t they keep searching? Are they too busy or afraid 
that all the good apartments will be gone soon? It’s not clear why people 
stop searching and accept a less-than-perfect option, but it’s clear that 
we do.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 Satisficing saves us time and trouble, so it’s fine for minor decisions. But 
when it comes to deciding what business strategy to use, which job to 
take, or whether to stop brainstorming about a major challenge or keep 
looking for more ideas, you definitely don’t want to satisfice. You want 
to optimize — seek the best option (or at least a really good one).
 
 When we accept mediocre options and choices, we turn our backs on 
our potential to create optimal solutions and don’t use our capacity for 
innovation. The next time you find yourself saying, “Oh, well, I guess it’s 
good enough,” stop, give yourself a kick in the rear, and ask, “Or is it? 
What if I pour a little more creative energy into this problem? Maybe I 
can find an optimal solution, not just an adequate one!”
 
✓ The tendency to let groups of people reach incorrect or inadequate 
conclusions: There are a lot of group decision-making biases, each with 
its own peculiar flavor:
 
• Groups can be too polite, with each member being afraid to say 
something critical about a proposed course of action of decision, 
even though it’s not a very good one.
 
• Groups can defer to a dominant person rather than get into 
conflict with him, even though other members may have valid 
alternative points of view that aren’t being considered fully.
 
• Groups tend to talk and think about what they have in common — 
their shared information and knowledge base — and to fail to take 
advantage of the unique perspectives of people whose knowledge 
isn’t shared by the rest of the group.
 
• Groups, just like the people who make them up, can be quite 
illogical, failing to apply general principles or abstract beliefs to 
specific decisions.
 
 In business, people often make key decisions in small groups — 
management teams, boards of directors, product development teams, 
and so on. I recommend reading about group decision-making biases 
and failures to arm yourself against the many ways in which groups so 
easily get things wrong.
Nurture a Secret Project
Your boss is probably never going to assign you the task of going off and 
thinking up something brilliant. She’s going to expect you to be at your desk, 
logging the face time needed to prove that you’re a diligent worker. The 
challenge you face is finding time in your overcrowded daily schedule to 
daydream, imagine, brainstorm, or free-associate.
In the daily press of work, you need to step back and ask really big questions, 
like these:

329
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Stimulate Your Creative Genius
 
✓ What’s the future of my industry, and how can I help bring it about?
 
✓ What’s the biggest, most challenging problem in our business right now, 
and how can I help solve it?
 
✓ What needs inventing right now, and why don’t I just sit down and 
invent it?
Why indeed? If you tried to sit down and think about ideas for an important 
invention, your boss would notice that you weren’t shuffling papers or 
punching the keypad of your computer and would tell you to stop napping 
and start working.
For many of us, it’s unfortunately necessary to sneak the time needed to do 
any major creative thinking. Adopt a special, personal project or problem to 
stew on and don’t tell your boss or co-workers about it unless you begin to 
see some practical solutions that you can propose. Until then, keep working 
in secret, between boring routine tasks, and keep your notes filed away in 
some private place. Oh, and don’t feel bad about this particular bit of dishonesty. 
It’s to everyone’s ultimate good for you to try to come up with a brilliant 
breakthrough idea. After all, someone’s got to.
Cross-Train in Art
It takes years to get really good at something as difficult as drawing, playing 
guitar, flamenco dancing, or cooking gourmet meals, but even if you never 
achieve full mastery, the journey offers many benefits. Studying and practicing 
anything artistic are great ways to get in touch with and strengthen your 
creative self.
Join a creative-writing group, for example. Please! If you’re not actively 
exercising your imagination, you aren’t going to come up with any brilliant 
ideas or inventions. It’s just as plain and simple as that. The arts, which are 
by nature extremely creative, offer a great way to train the same mental 
muscles that you need to be a brilliant innovator at work.
Do Art Projects with Your Kids
Here’s an interesting addendum to my tip about using the arts to build your 
innovation skills: Young people used to do a lot more art in the course of their 
academic careers. It was common to include arts in the curriculum in many 
schools, and it was also common for many children to take music lessons and 
to draw, paint, act, work with clay, or make jewelry and crafts for fun. Now 
schools are cutting back on arts funding to concentrate on science, math, and 
reading skills, while at home, children watch TV or play computer games.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
What’s lost by not having children engage in artistic expression every day? 
Certainly, the arts are poorer, but even more important, the imagination is 
poorer. What we learn from the arts about creative thinking, problem-solving, 
and expression translates strongly and directly into our working lives. If you 
have children at home, you may want to consider doing arts or crafts with 
them so as to share the benefits and to help prepare them to be innovative 
thinkers and doers in their adult working lives.
Start or Join an Inventors’ Club
Many groups of people meet regularly to share ideas and support one anothers’ 
efforts to invent cool things or to commercialize their cool inventions. Like-
minded people are always helpful and inspiring to be around, and where can 
you find more innovators in one place and time than at an inventors’ association 
meeting? Do a search for inventors’ clubs or associations near you, or go to 
the United Inventors Association Web site (www.uiausa.org) and look at its 
list of links to local clubs for contacts near you.
If a club isn’t near enough for you to attend meetings easily, consider starting 
your own. People in other associations and clubs can give you advice about 
organizing your own inventor’s group. You might start with the Houston 
Inventors Association, which posts a helpful article, “How to Start an Inventors 
Club,” on its Web site, www.inventors.org/invclub/h2start.htm.
 
If you have a great idea or design of your own that might be unique and 
worth patenting, don’t share it with members of an inventors’ club — not 
until you’ve actually filed for and received the needed patent protection. 
Otherwise, a more experienced inventor might beat you to the patent punch.

Ten Tips for Better Implementation 
of Your Ideas
In This Chapter
▶ Anticipating problems
▶ Building a strong team to maximize your chances of success
▶ Keeping clear records of your spending and your work
▶ Handling the conflicts and stresses of innovation
T
he best ideas and plans don’t amount to successful innovations unless 
they’re implemented well. Implementation is as important as creativity — 
sometimes more so.
Disorganization, disappointing initial results, or unanticipated flaws in the 
design or plan can derail many projects before they’ve really had a chance. 
Follow these tips to reduce the pain and suffering — and the high failure rate — 
of implementation.
Develop Your Team First
You have a great idea or plan, and you’re eager to implement it. I would be, 
too! However, a plan is only as good as the people who are expected to execute 
it. Before you start to work on your development or implementation activities, 
take a little time to form a strong team by following these guidelines:
 
✓ Make sure that you have the right group — a team with the needed 
expertise and capacity. You don’t want to have to change personnel or 
add more people because you failed to anticipate your staffing needs. 
The right group should be working together from the get-go to have a 
smooth, easy implementation.
 
✓ Talk about everyone’s quirks, rough edges, and pet peeves. Teams that 
share their requirements and concerns upfront are better able to work 
together because they know not to push one another’s hot buttons. 

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A certain amount of accommodation is always needed, and it’s better to 
know about personal styles and needs upfront than to discover them 
later, when people have bitter complaints and are too angry to discuss 
things with level heads. (Consider taking a personality test such as 
The Big Five self-assessment, available at www.tspectrum.com, and 
comparing your results to help understand differences and how to 
accommodate them.)
 
✓ Make the ground rules clear. Be explicit about what constitutes doing a fair 
share and who’s expected to do what. You get the RED (rules, expectations, 
and demands) out of group dynamics by discussing these items. Anyone 
who can’t live with them should have the option of opting out before he 
or she becomes integral to the work and hard to replace.
 
✓ Develop a sense of belonging by giving the team a strong identity. 
Brand the team with a name that everyone likes, give it a logo, and make 
sure that everyone is onboard with a big-picture vision of what you want 
to accomplish. Innovation should be exciting, so take time to articulate 
an enthusiastic view of what the team is trying to accomplish.
 
✓ Be sure about the purpose and focus. Don’t pull a group together to do 
one thing and then change your mind and tell it to do something else. 
Changing the purpose undermines your credibility as an innovation 
leader and hurts team morale. Do your strategic planning first so that 
when you charter a team, you’ll be clear about the project and can give 
team members clear instructions.
With these tips in mind, you can form a strong team that bonds around a 
motivating development goal. That’s what most innovations need to succeed.
Plan for the Worst
As the old saying goes, what can go wrong, will go wrong! Here are some of 
the things that can go wrong as you try to implement your innovation:
 
✓ Costs spiral out of control, and you have to give up before completion.
 
✓ Others sabotage the project because they think it will compete with 
their own projects or threaten their departments or budgets.
 
✓ A key assumption (about technology, more often than not) proves to be 
incorrect, and you have to go back to the drawing board to try to save 
the project with another approach or invention.
 
✓ Key people leave, taking some of the necessary knowledge with them and 
leaving the remaining team members unable to complete the project.
 
✓ Everything’s going fine, but a key source of funding or overhead support 
dries up, leaving you short of the resources needed to complete the project.
 
✓ The innovation proves to be a success, but there’s conflict about who 
developed it and who owns the intellectual property.

333
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Better Implementation of Your Ideas
When you’re developing your ideas, you need to be a confirmed optimist 
with a positive, creative outlook and a deaf ear to critics and naysayers. 
But as soon as you finalize a design or plan and begin to implement it, you 
need to switch mental gears and become a cautious pragmatist with a 
pessimistic streak.
After roughing out your plans, take at least a full day for your team to brain-
storm things that can go wrong with the plan. Make a thorough, pessimistic 
list; then sort it according to how fatal to the project each problem would be 
and how likely it is to occur. Very fatal, fairly likely problems deserve immediate 
planning to prevent them, and if you have to budget time and money for 
prevention, by all means do. It’s reasonable to include some preventive work 
for several of the major problems that could be fatal to your project. If you 
work within a large organization, for example, you may need to spend some 
time building political support to minimize the chance that others will 
sabotage your project.
Other potential problems may not need any immediate action because they 
haven’t actually occurred (yet . . .), but you should develop contingency 
plans for as many problems as you can. That way, you’ve already thought 
about how to shift course and work around various problems, should they 
occur. If you’re counting on a particular technology becoming commercially 
available in time for you to purchase a part for your new product, give some 
thought to alternative designs that don’t rely on the new technology. If the 
technology is late to market, you’ll be stuck without a key part for your 
product unless you have a backup plan in mind.
A well-planned development project includes some contingency plans 
for what to do when various things go wrong. It’s a bit like bringing your 
umbrella to work: If you make contingency plans, you’ll most likely be 
pleasantly surprised and will never need to use them.
Account for Each Project Separately
From the first time you purchase anything, the innovation should be a separate 
accounting entity. Give it a project name and code (if you’re using a computer-
based accounting system), or simply start a set of files or books for it that 
you can enter into an accounting program or electronic spreadsheet later. 
Whatever you do, just make sure that you track time, money, and the use of 
supplies or assets day by day, over the entire life of the project.
By accounting for each development project separately, you’ll know what 
you’re spending, how much you’ve invested, and what you’ll need in returns 
to make the innovation profitable. Also, it’ll be easier to project future 
expenses, which is a good idea when you update your plans.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
What if the project fizzles and you never implement the innovation? All the 
costs are potential tax deductions, provided that you accounted for them 
clearly from the beginning.
Also, if you’re an entrepreneur and hope to develop your invention to the 
point at which you can attract outside investors, you’d better have accurate, 
detailed records of what you’ve invested in it to date. Without those records, 
you’ll have a hard time showing how much your own investment is — and 
won’t get paid back for it with an appropriate share of equity.
Document Failures
It’s human nature to want to forget failures and mistakes. In innovation, however, 
it’s amazingly helpful to have detailed records of anything that goes wrong. 
Most projects suffer setbacks. The projects that ultimately succeed are the 
ones in which the development team learns from setbacks.
To learn from experience, you have to document and study it. Figure out 
what went wrong and why. Clarify what processes or materials you used and 
what alternatives you could try next time. Good records allow you to evaluate 
the innovation intelligently and learn rapidly from experience.
What if you reach an impasse, or something goes so terribly wrong that you 
have to abandon the project? You still need to document the problem before 
you close the project down. It’s amazing how many innovations proved to be 
a little ahead of their time. In a few years, revisit old failures to see whether 
technology has caught up with them and you can now find a good solution to 
a problem that seemed insurmountable before.
Differentiate Owners from Workers
I used to help Silicon Valley entrepreneurs write their business plans when 
they were ready to approach venture-capital firms for major funding. In 90 per-
cent of the ventures I saw, there was conflict about who ought to get a share of 
equity when the venture funding came in or when the company went public or 
was acquired by some major industrial, electronic, or pharmaceutical firm.
In the early days of a new venture, the lines between founders and employees 
blur easily. Some people may think that they’re working at reduced salaries 
in exchange for a chance to profit from the venture when it succeeds, but 
if they don’t have formal, written documents proving that they own shares, 
they won’t get a dime when the next round of investment comes in. What 
they may get instead is an aggressive lawyer who will harass the founders or 
owners and quite possibly scare investors away. Nobody wants to invest in a 
startup team whose members are lawyered up and angry at one another.

335
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Better Implementation of Your Ideas
A similar problem arises with many patent filings. Who are the inventors? 
Is a lab assistant an inventor, or was she just doing work for hire? She may 
think that she contributed an important idea to the final design, but the 
senior scientists may disagree. Then there’s the question of how the inven-
tors assigned the rights. Did they develop their patentable invention while 
working for an employer that thinks it ought to control the rights, or did they 
come up with the key ideas on their own time?
To prevent confusion and conflict about ownership and intellectual-property 
questions, clarify every role from the very beginning. Most people who will 
contribute to your project will be employees or contractors working on a 
work-for-hire basis, and the terms of their employment ought to specify that 
they won’t have any legal interest in the innovation. (See Chapter 17 for more 
information about managing your intellectual property.)
Communicate
If you’re developing a prototype product all by yourself, all you need to do 
is make sure that your patent attorney knows what you’re up to. But usually, 
innovation involves a growing number of people as the project progresses. 
Any new development, whether it’s a patentable product, a new business 
process, or an exciting new ad campaign, is going to require cooperation 
within a core project team, as well as periodic contributions from an ever-
expanding circle of occasional contributors.
Communication is key to keeping all the contributors on track and avoiding 
errors, confusion, and rework. I can guarantee that no two members of 
your team see the project exactly the same way or have exactly the same 
ideas about how to complete it, what the specifications should be, or any 
other details. Unless you make everyone talk regularly, in detail, about what 
they’ve been doing and what they plan to do next, things will go wrong.
Although constant communication can seem to be boringly detail oriented, 
hold weekly (at least) project meetings — in person if possible, or by 
videoconference or teleconference — to go over who’s doing what. I guarantee 
that every meeting will uncover at least one point of confusion or misunder-
standing that you’ll be glad you cleared up.
Avoid Burnout
Take a break. You deserve it. Even if you don’t think that your results are 
sufficient to earn you a break, I’m sure you need one. People suffer burnout 
when they’re working on the scale-up and implementation of innovations. 
Burnout is a common problem because the work creates a sense of urgency.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Innovating is exciting and tense and can be very rewarding emotionally, but 
it can also be highly stressful. Manage your health, and keep your energy up 
so that you have the strength and resilience to see the project through to the 
end, even if unexpected problems arise and the timeline has to be pushed 
back. Good emotional health is essential to successful innovation.
Resolve Conflicts (Don’t Avoid Them)
Disagreements can and should arise during development and implementation. 
There are difficult decisions to be made, and you often have to make them 
under time and cost pressures. The core team of innovators has an emotional 
stake in making the idea work. People get more emotionally involved in 
innovation than in regular work, and the result is conflict.
People use a variety of styles or approaches to deal with conflicts. Avoidance, 
accommodation, competition, and compromise are four of the most common 
styles (see Chapter 13). A development or implementation team needs to use a 
fifth style for resolving conflict: collaboration. To collaborate effectively, each 
party to the conflict needs to share concerns honestly, clearly, and fully, with 
no holding back, no politicking, no deception, and no overasking in the hope of 
winning ground from more-accommodating teammates.
A collaborative approach is important in innovation teams because it produces 
the highest-quality solutions to conflicts. It also preserves and in most cases 
improves the working relationships within the team. In other words, it’s good 
for both the team and the project for team members to collaborate by 
communicating fully and honestly about any concerns or disagreements.
For more information on how to negotiate a high-quality, collaborative solu-
tion to disagreements within your development or implementation team, see 
Chapter 13 or consult Mastering Business Negotiation by Roy J. Lewicki and 
Alexander Hiam (Jossey-Bass); or study The Conflict Master Course: Turning 
Conflict Into Cooperation, a workshop published by Trainer’s Spectrum (www.
tspectrum.com).
Know When to Persevere
If your basic assumptions about your innovation hold true, but you run into 
practical difficulties that slow you down, it’s usually a good idea to persist. 
There are good reasons to pull the plug on a project, but there are plenty of 
bad reasons too.

337
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Better Implementation of Your Ideas
Don’t give up prematurely! Every innovator runs into some unforeseen 
difficulties during development, scale-up, or implementation. Things rarely 
work out as easily as you hoped. If the project is fundamentally on track 
and the basic idea is valid, however, don’t allow a few practical problems to 
derail it.
What if you’re going over time or money budgets? Well, that could prove to 
be fatal, but it doesn’t always have to be. There can be alternative ways to 
fund a project. Also, you can always revisit the forecasts and see whether 
the work you’ve done allows you to make a better-looking forecast for future 
returns. If so, an increase in investment may be justifiable. It’s worth running 
the numbers again, anyway.
Many projects go through several rounds of effort and funding before finally 
breaking through to commercial or practical success. Yours could be one of 
those projects that needs the team to regroup, reassess, and then reinvest in 
another round. Be careful not to pull the plug prematurely. Nobody said 
innovation was easy!
Know When to Quit
Every innovative plan, design, or project rests on a few key assumptions. When 
a key assumption proves to be flawed or just plain wrong, it’s time to admit 
defeat and close the project before any more effort or money is wasted on it.
 
It’s hard to admit that you’re wrong. It’s disappointing to quit. Winners never 
quit, or so the old saying goes. But that’s not a good rule for innovators. A 
better saying is this one: If you can’t win this game, try to win the next game. 
Innovators who are smart enough to walk away from a loser quickly are able 
to get started on a new project quickly too, which greatly increases their odds 
of success.
What are your key assumptions? What do you need to be right about for your 
project to be worthwhile? Make a short list of critical assumptions and then 
see whether they prove to be correct. If not, pull the plug on the project at 
once and begin searching for your next big idea.
