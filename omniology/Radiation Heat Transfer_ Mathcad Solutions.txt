Preface
PREFACE
This book contains Mathcad Functions and problems solved on following topics:
Laws of Radiation and Radiation properties, View factors & Radiation energy exchange 
between black bodies, Electrical network method & Radiation energy exchange in 2-zone 
and 3-zone enclosures, Radiation shielding, Radiation error in temperature measurement.
Here, problems are solved using the popular software, Mathcad. (Ref: http://www.ptc.com/
engineering-math-software/mathcad/free-trial)
Many Functions are written in Mathcad for Radiation Laws, View Factors for various 
geometries, Radiation heat exchange in 2-zone and 3-zone enclosures, Radiation 
shields, radiation error in temp measurement etc. These Functions enable us to make 
the complicated calculations very easily.
Emphasis is given not only to solving a given problem but also to parametric analysis and 
graphical representation of results. Advantage of using Software to solve a variety of problems 
thus becomes evident.
It is hoped that this book will be useful to teachers, students, researchers and professionals 
working in this field.
For students, it should be particularly useful to study, review the subject and solve the 
homework problems.

Radiation Heat Transfer: Mathcad Solutions
RADIATION HEAT TRANSFER: 
MATHCAD SOLUTIONS
Learning objectives:
1.	Radiation mode of heat transfer differs from conduction and convection modes 
in the sense that there is no need for a medium to be present for heat transfer to 
occur. But, just as conduction and convection heat transfers occur when there 
is a temperature gradient, net radiation heat transfer also occurs from a higher 
temperature level to a lower temperature level.
2.	Radiation heat transfer is proportional to the fourth power of absolute temperature 
of the radiating surface. Therefore, radiation becomes the predominant mode of 
heat transfer when the temperature of the body is high.
3.	Our interest in this chapter is on ‘thermal radiation’, i.e. radiations in the wave 
length range of 0.1 to 100 microns. 
4.	Few important applications of radiation heat transfer:
i)	 industrial heating, such as in furnaces
ii)	industrial air-conditioning, where the effect of solar radiation has to be 
considered in calculating the heat loads
iii)	jet engine or gas turbine combustors
iv)	industrial drying
v)	energy conversion with fossil fuel combustion etc.
5.	In this book, first, we write Mathcad Functions and solve problems on fundamental 
laws governing radiation heat transfer. Calculation of ‘view factor’ for different 
geometries by analytical methods and by view factor algebra, is dealt with next. 
6.	Then, we write very useful Mathcad Functions and solve problems related to 
radiation heat transfer between surfaces in two-surface and three-surface enclosures, 
using the radiation network method. This method greatly simplifies the analysis 
and gives a ‘physical feel’ of the problem. Important practical examples of two-
surface enclosure are: two infinite, parallel planes, long concentric cylinders and 
concentric spheres. Furnaces with re-radiating (insulated) surfaces are examples of 
three-surface enclosure.
7.	‘Radiation shielding’ to reduce the radiation heat transfer between surfaces is 
studied next. Importance of radiation shielding in reducing the radiation error in 
temperature measurement is also studied. Useful Mathcad Functions are written and 
problems solved on these topics too.

Laws of Radiation and Radiation properties
Solid angle: “Solid angle’ is defined as a region of a sphere, which is enclosed by a conical 
surface with the vertex of the cone at the centre of the sphere. See Fig. below:
If a plane area A intercepts the line of propagation of radiation such that the normal to the 
surface makes an angle θ with the line of propagation, then we project the incident area 
normal to the line of propagation, such that, the solid angle is now defined as:
Z
A cos T
( )

r2
sr
(13.3)
Note that, A.cos(θ) = An is the projected area of the incident surface, normal to the line 
of propagation.
Intensity of radiation (Ib): Intensity of radiation for a black body, Ib is defined as the energy 
radiated per unit time per unit solid angle per unit area of the emitting surface projected 
normal to the line of view of the receiver from the radiating surface.
Mathematically, this is expressed as:
I b

Note that Emissive power Eb of a black body refers to unit surface area whereas Intensity 
Ib of a black surface refers to unit projected area.
IbO  is the intensity of blackbody radiation for radiation of a given wave length λ. And, Ib 
is the summation over all the wave lengths, i.e.

in a direction θ from the normal to the surface is proportional to the cosine of the angle 
θ”. i.e.

.
13.3 Laws of black body radiation:
Planck’s Law for spectral distribution: 
Radiation energy emitted by a black surface depends on the wave length, temperature of 
the surface and the surface characteristics.
Planck’s distribution Law relates to the spectral black body emissive power, EbO  defined 
as ‘the amount of radiation energy emitted by a black body at an absolute temperature T 
per unit time, per unit surface area, per unit wave length about the wave length λ’. Units 
of EbO  are: W/(m2.µm). The first subscript ‘b’ indicates black body and the second subscript 
‘λ’ stands for given wavelength, or monochromatic. Planck derived his equation for EbO  in 
1901 in conjunction with his ‘quantum theory’.

Plots of EbO  vs. λ for a few different temperatures are shown in Fig. below [2]:
Wein’s displacement law:
It is clear from the Fig. that the spectral distribution of emissive power of a black body 
at a given absolute temperature goes through a maximum. To find out the value of Omax, 
the wave length at which this maximum occurs, differentiate Planck’s equation w.r.t. λ and 
equate to zero. Finally, we get:

Wein’s displacement law is stated as: “product of absolute temperature and wave length

Relation between Radiation intensity and Emissive power:

(13.21)
i.e. Total emissive power of a black (diffuse) surface is equal to π times the intensity 
of radiation.
This is an important relation, which will be used while calculating the view factors required 
to determine net energy exchange between surfaces.
Total hemispherical emissivity ((H)) of a surface is the average emissivity over all directions 
and all wave lengths and is expressed as: 
H T

E T
(

Eb T
(

E T
(

where E(T) is the emissive power of the real surface.
Similarly, spectral emissivity is defined as:
H O T

E O T

EbO T
( ) 
(13.23)
Emissivity values for a few surfaces at room temperature are given in handbooks.
A surface is said to be gray if its properties are independent of wave length, and a surface 
is diffuse if its properties are independent of direction.

To calculate the average emissivity:
Let the variation of spectral emissivity with wave length be as follows:
H1  = constant, 0 d O d O1 
H2  = constant, O1 d O d O2 
H3  = constant, O2 d O d f

Here, ‘directly’ means that reflection or re-radiated energy is not considered. View factor is 
denoted by F12, where the first subscript, 1 stands for the emitting surface, and the second 
subscript, 2 stands for the receiving surface. 
View factor between Infinitesimal areas:

This is a very useful and important relation. It helps one to find out one of the view

to calculate is obtained first, and the other view factor is found out next, by using the 
reciprocity theorem.

VIEW FACTORS AND RADIATION ENERGY 
EXCHANGE BETWEEN BLACK BODIES
Radiation energy exchange between black bodies:

(13.40)
Properties of View factor and view factor algebra:
Properties of view factor:
i)	 The view factor depends only on the geometrics of bodies involved and not on 
their temperatures or surface properties.
ii)	Between two surfaces that exchange energy by radiation, the mutual shape factors 
are governed by the ‘reciprocity relation’, viz. A1.F12 = A2.F21.
iii)	When a convex surface 1 is completely enclosed by another surface 2, it is clear 
from Fig. 13.14(a) that all of the radiant energy emitted by surface 1 is intercepted 
by the enclosing surface 2. Therefore, view factor of surface 1 w.r.t. surface 2 is 
equal to unity. i.e. F12 = 1. And, the view factor of surface 2 w.r.t. surface 1 is 
then easily calculated by applying the reciprocity relation, i.e. A1.1 = A2.F21, or, 
F21 = A1/A2.
iv)	Radiation emitted from a flat surface never falls directly on that surface (see Fig. 13. 
14 (b)), i.e. View factor of a flat surface w.r.t. itself is equal to zero, i.e. F11 = 
0. This is valid for a convex surface too, as shown in Fig. 13.14(c).
v)	For a concave surface, it is clear from Fig. 13.14(d) that F11 is not equal to zero 
since some fraction of radiation emitted by a concave surface does fall on that 
surface directly.

EXCHANGE BETWEEN BLACK BODIES
vi)	If two, plane surfaces A1 and A2 are parallel to each other and separated by a 
short distance between them, practically all the radiation issuing from surface 1 
falls directly on surface 2, and vice-versa. Therefore, F12 = F21 = 1
vii)	When the radiating surface 1 is divided into, say, two sub-areas A3 and A4, as 
shown in Fig. 13.15(a), we have: 
A 1 F 12

A 3 F 32

A 4 F 42


(13.41)
Obviously, F12 z F32 + F42. 
viii)	Instead, if the receiving surface A2 is sub-divided into parts A3 and A4 as shown 
in Fig. 13.15 (b), we have:
A 1 F 12

A 1 F 13

A 1 F 14


(13.42)
i.e. view factor from the emitting surface 1 to a sub-divided receiving surface is simply 
equal to the sum of the individual shape factors from the surface 1 to the respective 
parts of the receiving surface. This is known as ‘Superposition rule’.

ix)	Symmetry rule: If two (or more) surfaces are symmetrically located w.r.t. the 
radiating surface 1, then the view factors from surface 1 to these symmetrically 
located surfaces are identical. A close inspection of the geometry will reveal if there 
is any symmetry in a given problem.
x)	 Summation rule: Since radiation energy is emitted from a surface in all directions, 
invariably, we consider the emitting surface to be part of an enclosure. Even if there 
is an opening, we consider the opening as a surface with the radiative properties of 
that opening. Then, the conservation of energy principle requires that sum of all 
the view factors from the surface 1 to all other surfaces forming the enclosure, must 
be equal to 1. See Fig. 13.16, where the interior surface of a completely enclosed 
space is sub-divided into n parts, each of area A1, A2, A3…An.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

This is the case of heat transfer between two black surfaces. So, we use eqn.:
So, the problem reduces to calculating the view factor F
12 or F
21. 
We see that to calculate F
12 for areas A
1 and A
2 as oriented in the Fig., we do not readily 
have an analytical relation or a graph.
Let us denote the combined areas (A
1 + A

5 and (A
2 + A
4) by A
6. 
Then, we see that A
5 and A
6 are perpendicular rectangles which have a common edge, and 
we have graphs or analytical relation for the view factor for such an orientation. 
Then, we resort to view factor algebra, as follows:
Remember that by definition, view factor F12 is the fraction of radiant energy emitted by 
surface 1 which falls directly on surface 2. Looking at the fig., we can say that fraction of 
energy leaving A1 and falling on A2 is equal to the fraction falling on A6 minus the fraction 
falling on A4.

Rij is known as ‘space resistance’ and it represents the resistance to radiative heat flow between 
the radiosity potentials of the two surfaces, due to their relative orientation and spacing.
For a N surface enclosure, net heat transfer from surface i should be equal to the sum of 
net heat transfers from that surface to the remaining surfaces. i.e.

Case (i): Radiant heat exchange between two black surfaces:
For a black body, H  = 1, and J = Eb, as explained earlier. i.e. surface resistance 
[= (1 – H )/(A.H )] of a black body is zero.
Next, we shall consider four cases of practical interest where the view factor between the 
inner surface 1 and the outer surface 2 (i.e. F12) is equal to 1, and also the net radiation 
from a gray cavity:
Case (ii): Radiant heat exchange for a small object in a large cavity:
A practical example of a small object in a large cavity is the case of a steam pipe passing 
through a large plant room.

Eqn. (13.62) is an important result, which gives net radiation from a gray cavity to surrounding 
space. If it is desired, for example, to calculate the net radiation from a blind hole drilled 
in a flange, then the relation to use is the eqn. (13.62).

Fig. (a) above shows the radiation network for this case. The radiation network is drawn 
very easily by remembering the usual principles: for a black surface, the surface resistance is 
zero, i.e. Eb = J. For a re-radiating surface too, Eb = J, as already explained; further, for a re-
radiating surface, Q = 0. Between two given surfaces, the radiosity potentials are connected 
by the respective space resistances, as shown. It may be observed that the system reduces 
to a series-parallel circuit of resistances as shown in Fig.(b) above.
We get:

Here, Q12 is the net radiant heat transferred between surfaces 1 and 2. Similar expressions 
can be written for heat transfer between surfaces 2 and 3 (= Q23) and the heat transfer 
between surfaces 1 and 3 (= Q13).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Fig. (a) shows the radiation network for this case. The radiation network is drawn very 
easily by remembering the usual principles: for a black surface, the surface resistance is zero, 
i.e. Eb = J. For a re-radiating surface too, Eb = J; further, for a re-radiating surface, Q = 0. 
Between two given surfaces, the radiosity potentials are connected by the respective space 
resistances, as shown. The system reduces to a series-parallel circuit of resistances as shown 
in Fig. (b).
Q12 is the net radiant heat transferred between surfaces 1 and 2.
TR is the temp of re-radiating surface.

(13.59)
With one shield placed between plates 1 and 2, the radiation network will be as shown 
in Fig. (b) above. Note that now all the relevant resistances are in series. Net heat transfer 
between plates 1 and 2 is given as:
Q12-one shield = (Eb1-Eb2)/Rtot where Rtot is the total resistance.

Now, for two large parallel plates, we note:

Note that as compared to eqn. (13.59) for the case of no-shield, we have, with one shield, 
an additional term appearing in the denominator of eqn. (13.71). Therefore, if there are N

(13.73)
Note this important result, which implies that, when all emissivities are equal, presence of 
one radiation shield reduces the radiation heat transfer between the two surfaces to one-half, 
two radiation shields reduce the heat transfer to one-third, 9 radiation shields reduce the 
heat transfer to one-tenth etc.
For a more practical case of the two surfaces having emissivities of H 1 and H 2, and all shields 
having the same emissivity of H s, eqn. (13.72) becomes:

To determine the equilibrium temperature of the radiation shield:
Once Q12 is determined from eqn. (13.71), the temperature of the shield is easily found 
out by applying the condition that in steady state:
Q 12 Q 13 Q 32 
(13.75)
We can use either of the conditions: Q12 = Q13 or Q12 = Q32. 
Q13 or Q32 is determined by applying eqn. (13.59); i.e. we get:

In eqn. (13.77), we have: (A1/A2) = (r1/r2), and (A1/A3) = (r1/r3).
Note that as compared to the relation for two concentric cylinders with no shield (i.e. 
eqn. 13.60), an additional term appears in the denominator of eqn. (13.77) (i.e. the third 
term) when one radiation shield is introduced; if there is a second radiation shield, say (4), 
then one more similar term will have to be added in the denominator to take care of the 
resistance of that shield.
In this case too, the equilibrium temperature of the shield is determined by applying the 
principle that, in steady state,

Radiation shielding
Applying the above equation, we write, using the ‘Solve block’ of Mathcad:
Note: In the above, Temp_shield is written as a function of R1, R2,…T1, T2.
This will make it very convenient to calculate the temp of shield, and also to make 
parametric analysis and draw graphs.

Prob.D2.5. Two long, concentric cylinders have diameters of 40 and 80 mm. The inside 
cylinder is at 800 C and the outer cylinder is at 100 C. Inside and outside emissivities are 
0.8 and 0.4. Calculate the percent reduction in heat transfer if a cylindrical shield of 60 mm 
dia and emissivity of 0.3 is placed between the cylinders. Also, calculate the equilibrium 
temp of the shield.
(b) Plot the percent reduction in heat transfer and the Shield temp as emissivity (on either 
side) of shield varies from 0.05 to 0.35.

RADIATION HEAT TRANSFER
165
Radiation error in temp measurement
Let the reading shown by the thermometer be Tc. This reading, however, does not represent 
the true temperature of the fluid Tf, since the thermometer bulb will lose heat by radiation 
to the walls of the channel which are at a lower temperature Tw (which is usually the case). 
The temperature Tc shown by the thermometer will be some value in between Tf and Tw.
We wish to find out the true temperature of the fluid Tf, by knowing the thermometer 
reading Tc.
Making an energy balance on the thermometer bulb, in steady state, we have:
Without radiation shield:
qconv to the bulb = qrad from the bulb

(13.79)
where Ac = surface area of thermometer bulb, 
H c = emissivity of thermometer bulb surface
Eqn. (13.79) gives the true temperature of the fluid Tf. 
Second term on the RHS of eqn. (13.79) represents the error in temperature measurement 
due to radiation effect.

In eqn. (13.80), Fcs = view factor of thermometer bulb w.r.t the shield and is, generally 
equal to 1.
Making an energy balance on the shield:
heat transferred to shield from the fluid by convection + 
heat transferred to shield from bulb by radiation =

where, A s = area of shield on one side
H  s = emissivi tty of shield surface
A c = area of bulb surface
H  c = emissivi ty of bulb surface
F cs = view factor of bulb w.r.t. shield
In the first term of the above eqn. factor 2 appears since convective heat transfer to the shield 
occurs on both surfaces of the shield. Also, in writing the RHS, the inherent assumption 
is that:
F sw 1	
… view factor between the shield and the walls
and,
A s
A w
0	
… i.e. surface area of shield is negligible compared to the area of the 
channel walls
Solving eqns. (13.80) and (13.81) simultaneously, we obtain the shield temperature Ts and 
the thermometer reading Tc, (if Tf is known), or Tf (if Tc is known).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Radiation error in temp measurement
Note that the in the above Solve block, Tc and Ts are written as Functions of Tw, Tf , (H)c, 
(H)s and h. This helps us to vary any of those variables and find Tc and Ts and to draw 
graphs.
Result of above Function for the above example is:
Tc is the first item of the result vector, and Ts is the second item.
We extract these from the output vector as:
========================================================================
Prob.E2.2. Hot gas at 1350 K is flowing in a duct whose walls are maintained at a 
temperature Tw = 530 K. A thermocouple (TC) placed in the stream to measure temp. If 
the emissivity of the thermocouple junction is H c = 0.5 and the convective heat transfer 
coefficient between the flowing air and the thermocouple is h = 115 W/(m2.C), find out 
the temperature shown by the TC.
(b) Now, if a radiation shield (H s = 0.1) is placed between the thermocouple and the walls, 
what will be new value of Tc read by the thermocouple? And how much is the radiation error?
