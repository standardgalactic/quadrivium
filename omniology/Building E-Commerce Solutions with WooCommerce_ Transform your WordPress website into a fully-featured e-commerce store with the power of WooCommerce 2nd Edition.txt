Preface
Back in the early days of WordPress, the platform was mainly used to create and 
run blogs. Soon plugins became available to add functionality to the platform. A 
couple of e-commerce plugins became available as well. However, often they were 
incomplete or buggy.
In 2011, the WooCommerce plugin became available on the market, developed 
by the popular creators of Woothemes.com, where you can buy premium 
WordPress themes. WooCommerce was an instant hit and reached over ten 
thousand downloads in the first couple of weeks. A few years later, the plugin was 
downloaded almost 1.4 million times and it received a complete makeover during 
2013 with the release of WooCommerce 2.0. Meanwhile, the solution has become 
mature and is even used for larger online stores.
The reason that the plugin became so popular is that it is so easy to use. Millions of 
people were already using WordPress for their blogs and websites and were looking 
for an easy way to be able to sell products and services directly on their own website. 
WooCommerce made this possible for all of us.
This book will explain you how to set up WooCommerce, create products, and use 
payment and shipping methods. You will work with themes and add plugins to 
expand the functionality of WooCommerce. It will teach you how to create and run 
your own online store in a very easy, straightforward manner.
It's time to get started!
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce, shows you how to set up a test environment and 
install WooCommerce. After that, you'll learn how to set up WooCommerce and 
work with taxes.

Preface
[ vi ]
Chapter 2, Creating Your First Products, helps you create your very first products. 
You'll learn what the minimum steps are to get your products available and be  
able to start selling them.
Chapter 3, Using Downloadable Products and Variations, offers various other possibilities 
when creating products. In this chapter, you'll create downloadable products, learn 
how to work with attributes, and create variable products.
Chapter 4, Payments, Shipping, and Coupons, shows you how to set up payment and 
shipping methods for your store. You will also learn how to use discount coupon 
codes for marketing purposes.
Chapter 5, Working with WooCommerce Themes, shows you what you need to pay 
attention to and where to buy or download good themes. Having a solid WordPress 
theme available for your WooCommerce store is very important.
Chapter 6, Customizing a WooCommerce Theme, gives you a brief introduction to 
themes to get you started. Creating a WordPress and WooCommerce theme is worth 
a book by itself. You'll actually make code changes to your theme and find some 
practical examples.
Chapter 7, Running Your Online Store, starts with explaining how to bring a 
development store live. What do you do when the first orders flow in? How do you 
use WooCommerce to make sure that orders are handled correctly? We'll also show 
how to manually create an order and speak about reporting. Time to bring your store 
online and start selling!
Chapter 8, More Possibilities Using Plugins, explains which plugins to use and where 
to look for other possibilities. WooCommerce is a plugin for WordPress. On top 
of WooCommerce, you can install additional plugins to expand or change the 
functionality. But there are so many options, which plugins are a good choice?.
What you need for this book
In this book, we're assuming that you're familiar with using WordPress. You do  
not need development skills, but just a basic user-level knowledge of WordPress 
should be sufficient. Your WordPress website should be a self-hosted one. Using 
WordPress.com is not an option as it does not offer the possibility to install your  
own WordPress plugins.
If you're not yet familiar with WordPress, we highly recommend that you read one 
of the WordPress beginner's books or tutorials first. WordPress 4.x Complete from 
Packt Publishing is a good start (https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/
wordpress-40-complete).

Preface
[ vii ]
If you're already working with WordPress, we're also assuming that you know how 
to work with an FTP tool, like the free FileZilla.
Besides this, it's handy to have image manipulation software available, such as 
Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Fireworks, or Gimp.
Finally, you'll need a code editor if you want to be able to change or create your 
own WooCommerce themes, a topic that we'll cover in Chapter 6, Customizing a 
WooCommerce Theme. Well-known editors are Notepad++ for Windows users and 
Coda or Sublime Text for Mac users. There are plenty of alternatives as well; just use 
the tools that you like.
Who this book is for
This book has been written for everyone who wants to learn how to expand an existing 
WordPress website with e-commerce functions using the WooCommerce plugin.
WooCommerce is an easy-to-use, but fully-functional, e-commerce plugin that 
will turn your website into a fully-featured online store. The book is suitable for 
marketers, e-commerce (project) managers, and web design agencies working with 
WordPress. First of all, this book is meant for everyone willing to run their own 
online store on a relatively small budget.
Although this book is not aimed at developers, some WooCommerce code examples 
are provided in this book.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, 
pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: 
"Next, simply enter WooCommerce in the Search Plugins field and hit Enter."
A block of code is set as follows:
add_action( 'get_header', 'remove_storefront_sidebar' );
function remove_storefront_sidebar() {
  if ( is_product() ) {
    remove_action( 'storefront_sidebar', 'storefront_get_sidebar',  
      10 );
  }
}

Preface
[ viii ]
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the 
screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Click on 
Plugins in the menu on the left-hand side, and click on Add New".
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.

Setting Up WooCommerce
During the last couple of years, WordPress has outgrown any other Content 
Management Solution worldwide. Numerous websites are built using WordPress on 
a daily basis. WordPress is even popular among large companies. Currently about a 
quarter of all websites worldwide are powered by WordPress.
WooCommerce is a plugin for WordPress that turns your website into a complete 
online store. Practically in minutes, but that doesn't mean that the solution is very 
limited. This book will show you what you can do with it. WooCommerce is a 
versatile plugin that gives the possibility for everyone with a little WordPress 
knowledge to start their own online store.
Originally, WooCommerce was derived from the Jigoshop plugin. The WordPress 
theme developers of WooThemes quickly brought the solution to a higher level 
and soon it became the most popular plugin for e-commerce within WordPress. 
In 2015, Automattic (the company behind WordPress) acquired WooThemes and 
WooCommerce. So we could almost say that WooCommerce has become the default 
ecommerce solution for WordPress now. At time of print WooCommerce is even 
powering 30% of all online stores worldwide.
In case you are not familiar with WordPress at all, this book is not the first one you 
should read. No worries though, WordPress isn't that hard to learn and there are a 
lot of online possibilities resources to learn about WordPress solution very quickly. 
Or just turn to one of the many printed books on WordPress that are available.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 2 ]
The following are the topics covered in this chapter:
•	
Setting up your test environment
•	
Installing and activating WooCommerce
•	
Using all WooCommerce settings
•	
Setting up Tax
•	
Adding WooCommerce pages to your WordPress menu
Setting up your test environment
Before we start, remember that it's only possible to install your own plugins if you're 
working in your own WordPress installation. This means that users that are running 
a website on WordPress.com will not be able to follow along. It's simply impossible 
in that environment to install plugins yourself. WooCommerce has recently become 
a part of WordPress itself. I can imagine that because of this WooCommerce might 
become available for WordPress.com users in the future. But so far there are no signs 
yet of an integration of WooCommerce into WordPress.com.
When starting with WooCommerce there are two situations that might occur:
•	
You have a running WordPress website to which you'd like to add 
WooCommerce
•	
You want to start from scratch and create a new WordPress installation 
including WooCommerce
Either way, you'll need a test environment to be able to play with WooCommerce and 
follow along with this book. Although technically possible to add WooCommerce 
to an existing WordPress website immediately, I highly recommend using a test 
environment. Things can and will go wrong and you don't want to confront your 
current visitors with your experiments.
Setting up a WordPress test environment isn't as difficult as it might seem. There are 
tons of tutorials available, whether you're working on Windows or working with a 
Mac. When you want to add WooCommerce to your existing website, this is what 
you need to do to setup a test environment:
1.	 Create a backup copy of your complete WordPress environment using 
FTP. Alternatively use a plugin to store a copy into your Dropbox folder 
automatically: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-backup-to-
dropbox. There are lots of solutions available, just pick your own favorite. 
UpDraftPlus is another option and delivers a complete backup solution as 
well: http://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/.

Chapter 1
[ 3 ]
2.	 Don't forget to backup your WordPress database as well. You may do this 
using a tool like phpMyAdmin and create an export from there. But also in 
this case, there are plugins that make life easier. The UpDraftPlus plugin 
mentioned above can perform this task as well. The steps 1 and 2 aren't 
necessary when you're starting a new WordPress installation from scratch.
3.	 Once your backups are complete, install XAMPP on a local (Windows) 
machine: http://www.apachefriends.org. Although XAMPP is available 
for Mac users, MAMP is a widely used alternative for this group: http://
www.mamp.info/en/index.html. Restore your WordPress backup on your 
test server by copying all files to a subfolder and by restoring the database 
using phpMyAdmin.
4.	 Note that after restoring your database using phpMyAdmin, it's necessary to 
update the contents of the database as well. Unfortunately WordPress stores 
the full path URLs in lots of different database records. Without changes, 
those would still point to the location of your live website and not to your 
test environment. I mostly use a 'Search and replace' script to solve this 
issue. https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-
for-wordpress-databases/. You can download the script, and store the 
contents of the zip file in a new subfolder of your test environment. Start it 
from there, like in the screenshot below. Next, replace the old URL with the 
new one from your test environment:

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 4 ]
Alternatively, install a copy of your WordPress website as a temporary subdomain 
at your hosting provider. For instance, if my website is http://www.example.com, I 
could easily create a copy of my site in http://test.example.com. Possibilities may 
vary, depending on the hosting package you have with your hosting provider. Also 
in this scenario you need to adjust the content of the database, as mentioned in step 
four above.
If in your situation it isn't needed to add WooCommerce to an existing WordPress 
site, of course you may also start from scratch. Just install WordPress on a local test 
server or install it at your hosting provider.
To keep our instructions in this book as clear as possible we did just that, so that 
there's no visible interference with already existing content and a custom theme. We 
created a fresh installation of WordPress version 4.2. Below you see a screenshot of 
our setup, still completely empty using the Twenty Fifteen default theme:
More information about setting up a test environment and restoring your website on 
it can be found in the following articles:

Once ready, we'll be able to take the next step and install the WooCommerce plugin. 
Let's take a look at our WordPress back-end. In our situation we can open this by 
browsing to http://localhost/wootestshop/wp-admin. Depending on the choices 
you made above for your test environment, your URL could be different.
Well, this should all be familiar for you already. Again, your situation might look 
different, depending on your theme or the number of plugins that are already active 
for your website.
Installing WooCommerce
Installing a plugin is a fairly simple task:
1.	 Click on Plugins in the menu on the left and click on Add New.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 6 ]
2.	 Next, simply enter WooCommerce in the Search Plugins field and hit Enter.
3.	 Verify if the correct plugin is shown on top and click Install Now. Over time 
results will vary, but the WooCommerce plugin itself should always appear 
on top:

Chapter 1
[ 7 ]
4.	 Click on Activate Plugin. Note that in the shown screenshot, we're installing 
version 2.4.8 of WooCommerce. New versions will follow rather quickly, so 
you might already see a higher version number:
5.	 Next, WooCommerce starts a quick setup wizard, that gives the possibility to 
go through the most important settings. The wizard is optional. If you'd like 
to skip it just press Not right now, otherwise click the Let's go button. If you 
chose to skip the wizard, please read on at number 11 of this step-by-step 
guide.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 8 ]
6.	 When using the wizard, first a couple of pages will be created by 
WooCommerce. These pages are necessary to correctly run your store,  
so just press Continue:
7.	 Next, choose your local settings, like the country you're based in and the 
currency you want to use. Also, set the units of measure, even if you think 
you won't need those for your products:

Chapter 1
[ 9 ]
8.	 Set some basic shipping costs and determine how you want to work with 
taxes. Don't worry if you're still unsure here. You may Skip this step if you 
want to. Later on in this chapter these topics will be discussed in more detail:
If you enable the checkbox Yes, I will be charging sales tax, additional 
options will become visible. WooCommerce will suggest some default tax 
settings, based on the country/region you selected at step 7:

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 10 ]
9.	 In the next screen, you can decide which of the default available payment 
methods you'd like to use. PayPal is widely used and adding your PayPal 
e-mail address is enough to start using it. Also in here, you may skip the step 
if you're unsure about it. Adding other payment possibilities than the ones 
shown here will be discussed later on:

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
10.	 In the last step you're asked if you want to allow WooCommerce to gather 
diagnostic data of your store. If you do, you'll receive a discount coupon for 
extensions, which might be handy later on. Of course this step is optional. 
We recommend to click on the link Return to the WordPress Dashboard on 
the bottom. Although it is possible to immediately start adding products, we 
suggest to first pay more attention to the other WooCommerce settings:
In our example project, we're installing the English version of 
WooCommerce. But you might need a different language. By default, 
WooCommerce is already delivered in a number of languages. This 
means that the installation will automatically follow the language of your 
WordPress installation. If you need something else, just browse through 
the plugin directory on WordPress.org to find any additional translations.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 12 ]
11.	 Once we finished the wizard and returned to the WordPress Dashboard,  
two new menu items (WooCommerce and Products) have been added  
to the main menu on the left:
12.	 Meanwhile the plugin created the necessary pages that you can access by 
clicking on Pages in the menu on the left:
Note that if you open a page that was automatically created by 
WooCommerce, you'll only see a shortcode, that is used to call the needed 
functionality. Do not delete the shortcodes, or important WooCommerce 
pages like Cart, Checkout, and Shop will not work properly. However,  
it's still possible to add your own content before or after the shortcode on 
these pages.

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
Note that WooCommerce also added some widgets to your WordPress 
Dashboard, giving an overview of the latest product- and sales 
statistics. At this moment this is all still empty of course.
Setting up WooCommerce
WooCommerce is usable straight out of the box. However, in this section we'll cover 
almost every setup parameter that you may use to control your online store. Going 
through all settings might be quite overwhelming in the beginning, but it will help 
you in exploring the possibilities of WooCommerce.
The General Settings Tab
Click on WooCommerce in the left menu and then click Settings. A new page holding 
different tabs with settings appears. The first one visible is the tab named General:

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 14 ]
You will find certain fields described as follows:
•	
The Base Location holds the country of your store. The default setting may 
vary, depending on the country and language settings of  your WordPress 
environment. Just change it if needed. Note that if you're in the United States, 
you'll also have to choose the correct state in this field. Note that the country 
field will be used as the default country for calculating taxes. It will also be 
used as the default country for customers checking out or creating an account. 
•	
Next, determine to which countries you want to be able to sell at the field 
Selling Location(s). Give it some thought, because enabling a country 
also means you must be able to ship to that country. If you set this field to 
Specific Countries Only, a new field appears in which you must select the 
countries that you want to allow selling to.
•	
At the field Default Customer Address you can decide how WooCommerce 
should set its defaults when a visitor wants to make a purchase. It can 
automatically set the country field based on the Geolocation of the customer, 
but of course this will only work if the customer is not working from behind 
an anonymous proxy. It's also possible to set the base address of the store as a 
default or no address at all. Why is this setting important? Because shipping 
costs and tax calculations might be based on the address of the customer. The 
better you're guessing the customer's location, the better shipping costs will 
be estimated immediately.
•	
If you immediately installed WooCommerce in a live website—which is not 
recommended— you have the possibility to show a warning message to 
your visitors. By checking the field Store Notice, the field Store Notice Text 
becomes available, giving you the opportunity to write your own text that 
will be shown on the top of your site:

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
•	
The next five settings are all used to set the way WooCommerce should 
handle your currency. WooCommerce is only able to work with one  
currency at a time. Set the desired Currency and choose where to  
show the Currency symbol.
•	
Finally, choose the thousand separator, the decimal separator and set the 
number of decimals you want to calculate with.
The Products Settings Tab
Moving to the next tab you'll find different settings related to the usage of products 
in WooCommerce. Note that this tab is divided into four different sub areas, starting 
with another General tab:
•	
First set the unit of measures for weight and dimensions.
•	
Next, check the settings for working with product reviews. You may 
choose to disable them, although generally that isn't recommended. Having 
customer reviews is important for almost all kinds of products and services. 
And even negative reviews are not always as bad as they seem to be.
•	
By default a user that wants to send in a review also has to give a rating to 
the product. If in your case that isn't needed, you might disable that setting.
•	
The last two settings here are used to show if a user posting a review actually 
bought the product in your store. You may also decide not to accept a review 
from someone that didn't buy the product in your store.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 16 ]
The next area, named Display, shows several settings for products and categories:
The setting for products and categories are as follows:
•	
The Shop page is already prefilled for you. Don't change it unless there's a 
real reason to. If you want to give this page a different name just go to the 
Pages menu and change it in there.
•	
Next, decide what will be shown on this shop page and on the product 
category pages. By default they will only show Products, but you can also 
choose to show (sub) categories or both. Of course a setting like this can be 
changed later on as well, so if you're unsure, just leave the defaults and come 
back later to try the different options.
•	
The field Default Product Sorting sets the way the products will be sorted  
in the front-end. Visitors have the possibility to change the sort order for 
their session.

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
•	
The add to cart behavior is important to understand, although also this 
one can be changed later on. The field Redirect to the cart page after 
successful addition is switched off by default. If you enable it, the user will 
be redirected to the cart page immediately when adding an item to the cart. 
This is especially useful for shops where in most cases the user will only buy 
a single product. If you leave the first setting disabled and enable the field 
Enable AJAX add to cart buttons on archives the page is not reloaded when 
an item is added to the cart. You may just try these settings to see what fits 
your store best.
•	
At Product Images, you define the size of your product images in the 
category overview, product detail page and thumbnail display. The 
uploaded pictures have to be at least as big as the highest value entered here. 
Take a little time to think about the right dimensions. Changing it later on 
is possible, but not that easy. The least you need to do is to decide if you'd 
like to keep the default square images, or maybe use photos in portrait 
mode. This highly depends on the products you are going to sell. Note: the 
theme you're using influences these sizes as well. You will read more on 
themes later on, but this might be a good moment to look at your theme 
documentation to find if it's mentioning anything about product image sizes.
•	
Keep the product image gallery enabled for a better, user friendly view of 
your images.
If you change the image sizes after you created products or 
when using a new WordPress theme later on, the Regenerate 
Thumbnails WordPress plugin https://wordpress.
org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/ is very useful. 
It recalculates all images and image sizes at once.
•	
Press Save Changes at the bottom.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 18 ]
The next section shows various settings to manage the inventory of your products.
The inventory settings for the product page are as follows:
•	
First of all, set the Manage Stock field to Enable stock management if you 
want to work with inventory at all. If you're only going to sell services or 
downloadable products this might not be needed. If you're selling services 
as well as physical products then enable it here. It's possible to switch of 
inventory on product level later on.
•	
If you have limited stock available, you don't want it to be in a user's cart 
forever. On the other hand, once an item is in the cart you don't want to 
confront the user with a 'sorry sold out' message when they want to pay. 
The field Hold Stock gives you the possibility to influence the behaviour of 
WooCommerce in this area.
•	
When stock levels are important, you want to keep the Notifications field on 
enabled. Next, enter the email address these notifications need to be sent to.
•	
Next, set the Low Stock Threshold and Out of Stock Threshold, that will 
determine when the mentioned notifications will be sent. Unfortunately  
this is not a default. The settings chosen here will be the same for all of  
your products.

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
•	
Use the Out of Stock Visibility to decide whether or not to show products to 
visitors that are no longer available.
•	
Finally, set the field Stock Display Format to determine if stock levels are or 
aren't visible to your customers.
Remember to click the Save changes button at the bottom!
The last section holds some settings for downloadable products. If you're not 
planning to work with digital products you may skip this section:
The options are as follows:
•	
Change the first setting File Download Method only if you have any issues 
with downloading the products by your customers.
•	
Next, decide if a login is required to be able to download an item using the 
Access Restriction field. Technically this isn't necessary, but you might have 
other reasons to force a customer to create an account on your website.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 20 ]
The Tax settings tab
Setting up taxes can be a difficult task. Of course there's no 'one size fits all' approach 
possible here. Tax laws and calculations differ from country to country and region 
to region. Besides that there's a large difference in handling taxes when selling 
goods to consumers or to other businesses. So in here we'll just stick to the basics, by 
explaining the functionality WooCommerce has available. It's up to you to find out 
how tax calculations should be done for your specific situation.
The settings for Tax Options page are as follows:
•	
First of all, decide if you want to Enable Taxes. It's not always necessary to 
display taxes in your store to your customers. If you decide to switch it off, 
you may ignore all other fields below.
•	
Next, assuming that you enabled the field above, decide if you want to enter 
your sales prices including or excluding tax in the Prices Entered With Tax 
field. Including tax is quite common in a consumer oriented store, but again, 
this differs per region.

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]
•	
Depending on the tax rules in your country, you need to set the Calculate 
Tax Based On field. Sometimes taxes should be calculated based on the 
shipping address of the customer. In our example the base address of our 
store is used, which means that all customers will pay the same rate. By using 
the setting as shown, the applied tax rate will only depend on the product, 
not on the address of the customer.
•	
For the shipping costs, that will be discussed later on, you must also 
determine how the rate needs to be calculated. You set that using the field 
Shipping Tax Class. Although not always true, the default setting is often a 
good one, where the rate for shipping is the same as the one used for the item 
that is sold.
•	
WooCommerce works with a Standard tax rate by default. It's not possible 
to delete this one. You can add additional rates if you need them by adding a 
description of your choice to the Additional Tax Classes field. The Reduced 
Rate and Zero Rate have already been defined.
•	
The field Price Display Suffix may be used to display a short text just after 
the Price field. Use this to display for example including VAT.
•	
Once done, click on the link Standard Rates at the top of the screen to set 
your default tax rate. Click Insert Row. Just fill in the Rate % and set a Tax 
Name that makes sense for your customers. Note that it's possible to set rates 
per Country, State, or even based on Zip Code. Note that this will only work 
if you've chosen to base the tax calculations on the address of your customer! 
By default your Tax rate will also be used for the Shipping amount. Finally, 
using the field Compound it's possible to use multiple tax rates at once (tax 
on tax). Don't forget to hit the Save changes button:
Note that it's possible to import a CSV file with tax rates, which can be handy if 
you need to setup a lot of them. The Import CSV button brings you to the Tools | 
Import section of WordPress. Over there you'll also find the possibility to download 
an example file.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 22 ]
In a simplified way, assuming only one tax percentage applies, WooCommerce offers 
this method to calculate the tax amount:
Tax calculation for gross price (amount entered inclusive tax) is: tax_amount = price -  
( price / ( ( tax_rate_% / 100 ) + 1 ) ).
Tax calculation for net price (amount entered exclusive tax) is: tax_amount = price * ( 
tax_rate_% / 100 ).
When setting up taxes you might need to look up the two-digit 
country codes. Wikipedia has a good overview of all of them: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_
codes. Wikipedia is also helpful when you need more 
information on tax rates per country: https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates.
Setting up sales tax for the USA can be quite challenging sometimes. There's an 
easy solution for it, which is made available by WooTax: https://wootax.com/. 
Alternatively, have a look at the services offered by woosalestax.com (http://www.
woosalestax.com/).
The Checkout Settings Tab
Moving on to the Checkout settings tab, we see again several sublevels. For this 
moment, we'll only discuss the Checkout Options. All other panels contain setup 
information about specific payment methods. More on choosing and configuring 
payment methods will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 4, Payments, Shipping,  
and Coupons:

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
The Checkout Options are as follows:
•	
First, decide if you want Enable the use of coupons in your store. Using 
coupons gives a lot of marketing possibilities, but there's also a downside. 
Enabling this field will show a enter your coupon field on the front-end 
during checkout. Visitors will see the field and might start searching for a 
valid coupon on the web. In other words, only enable this setting if you're 
planning on using discount coupons.
•	
The next field is also enabled by default. Allowing a guest checkout has proven 
to be positive for conversions. Not everyone always wants to create an account 
for every store they buy something at. Having guest checkout enabled makes 
sure that these users can buy and pay without creating an account.
•	
The Force secure checkout field is used when working with SSL certificates. 
Enabling the field will mean that checkout is only possible when a SSL 
certificate is in place and a secure connection between the client (visitor) and 
the server (your website) could be made.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 24 ]
Not sure what a SSL certificate is and how to use that for your website? The principle cannot 
be explained in just a few sentences, but by using a SSL certificate on your website you'll 
be able to offer your visitors a safe connection during checkout. More and more customers 
pay attention to security measures like this. There are lots of companies that offer SSL 
certificates. Verizon (http://www.verizonenterprise.com/products/security/
identity/ssl/) is a  major player, but you may just as well ask your hosting provider for 
help. Especially if you need to be able to collect credit card information directly on your own 
website, using a SSL certificate is a must. In case you're using a payment service provider 
you do not really need one, but increasing trust is always a good thing. Besides that, the 
SSL certificate seems to become more important lately now that also Google considers it as 
one of the many ranking factors. So your website will rank better in Google if you have SSL 
enabled. More on payments will follow in Chapter 4, Payments, Shipping, and Coupons.
•	
At the Checkout Page, the first two fields have been pre filled again. You can 
keep them as they are. The third field, Terms and Conditions, is optional. If 
you want your customers to agree with your terms and conditions then do 
the following: save your changes here and head over to the Pages menu. Add 
a new page named Terms and conditions and fill it with your content. Save 
and publish that page. Next, come back here at the Checkout settings tab to 
select that page from the dropdown and save the settings again.
•	
The checkout endpoints were also automatically created. We recommend not 
to change these.
•	
Finally, the table with Payment gateways is shown and can be sorted here, 
but we'll discuss the usage of that one in Chapter 4, Payments, Shipping,  
and Coupons.
The shipping settings tab
Setting up Shipping works in a similar way as the Checkout setup. In here we'll 
show the Shipping Options and in Chapter 4, Payments, Shipping, and Coupons we'll 
get back with more detailed instructions:

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
The Shipping Options settings are as follows:
•	
The first setting is enabled by default. It is needed if you want to be able to 
charge shipping costs to your customers. If you're only selling digital goods 
it isn't needed.
•	
Selecting the field Enable the shipping calculator on the cart page will result 
in the Calculate Shipping option appearing on the cart page. The customer 
will be able to calculate the shipping costs for a delivery to his location 
before continuing with the checkout process. The calculation is based on the 
country and zip code, which means that it's only useful if your shop offers 
shipping costs that differ per region. This is a handy function if you have 
configured your shipping options to apply different shipping costs based on 
the customer's region.
•	
The next option will do the opposite. If you enable it, the shipping costs will 
not be shown as long as the customer did not enter an address.
•	
The Shipping Display Mode just determines the way the shipping options 
are presented to the user: using radio buttons or using a dropdown field.
•	
The Shipping Destination controls which of the customer addresses is used 
by default.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 26 ]
•	
The field Restrict shipping to Location(s) gives the possibility to limit the 
number of countries you're shipping to. For instance if you want to sell 
digital products to all countries, but can only offer shipping of physical 
goods to a couple of them. By default, WooCommerce allows to ship to all 
countries that you enabled in the General settings tab.
•	
Next, you see the available Shipping Methods. It's possible to expand this 
list using additional plugins. More details on configuring your shipping 
methods will follow in Chapter 4, Payments, Shipping, and Coupons.
The Accounts Settings Tab
We're moving to the next tab, named Accounts. There are only a couple of settings 
here that you need to pay attention to:

Chapter 1
[ 27 ]
The setting for Accounts is as follows:
•	
The first part, Account Pages and My Account Endpoints may all be left at 
their default settings.
•	
The Registration Options deserve some more attention. First of all, you set 
where the customer can create a new account for the store. Make it easy and 
enable them both. Next, by default WooCommerce will show a reminder on 
the checkout page, so that existing customers remember to login.
•	
At Account Creation, WooCommerce can use the e-mail address as a 
username, or let the customer pick a username for themselves. The default 
option is generally the best one, because customers often forget the 
usernames they chose. Besides that the username must be unique, so in a 
large shop it could become a frustrating task for a user if the username of 
their choice has already been taken.
The Email Settings Tab
In this tab, you can configure the way WooCommerce handles e-mails it will send to 
your customer:

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 28 ]
Also this tab contains several sub areas, starting with Email Options and followed by 
a couple of settings for every type of email WooCommerce can send:
•	
The "From" Name field is the name the receivers see in their email client. By 
default this is the name of your online store.
•	
The "From" Email Address field defaults to the administrator of the website, 
which defaults to the address created when installing WordPress. Of course 
this may be overwritten here.
•	
Next, if you want to you may add your logo as the Header Image for your 
emails. To be able to do that, do the following: Save any changes here and 
navigate to the Media menu. Upload your logo in the media manager. Open 
the image by clicking on it and copy the contents of the URL field. Go back 
to the WooCommerce settings and paste the URL in the Header Image field, 
like in the shown example.
•	
Feel free to change the default Email Footer Text field, which will be printed 
at the bottom of every e-mail.
•	
At the bottom of this settings tab, you have the possibility to change the 
default colors of the email messages, so that they fit to the colors of your 
website. Just click the color fields and use the color picker to change them. 
Or enter the hexadecimal color code directly into the field if you know the 
correct color codes of your website.
•	
After saving your changes, click the link in the middle of this tab to check the 
results. The shown e-mail message is empty, but it still gives you a good idea 
of how the messages will look like.
•	
If all seems correct, you can one by one check and change the settings of the 
various e-mails WooCommerce will send. The example below shows the 
settings of the New Order e-mail, which is the confirmation message that 
you will receive when your customer creates a new order:

Chapter 1
[ 29 ]
Note: if you want to change more than available, you 
might need additional plugins or make code changes to 
the e-mail files yourself.
The API Settings Tab
The Api Settings tab is not discussed in this book. Api keys and Webhooks can be 
used to integrate third party tools with WooCommerce. Based on a trigger, another 
website or service can receive data from WooCommerce when certain events 
happen on your site, for instance when a new order is created. More information on 
Webhooks can be found here: http://docs.woothemes.com/document/webhooks/.

Setting Up WooCommerce
[ 30 ]
Preparing our test store
Now that we had a look at all settings of WooCommerce it's time to start adding 
products to our store. Before we do so, there are a couple of things that we need to 
do before moving on:
1.	 We need to add a link to our Shop in our menu. To do this, navigate to 
Appearance | Menus in the WordPress admin menu on the left. In your 
menu, add the Shop page to it. The simple example below shows a menu 
with only the home page and the Shop page assigned to it:
2.	 Since we are working on a clean installation of WordPress, it's wise to 
install a WooCommerce compatible WordPress theme. Don't worry yet if 
you have an existing website and don't know if your theme is compatible 
with WooCommerce—we'll cover that later on. Only do this if you started 
with a clean install and want to follow along. In our demo store we simply 
install the free theme named StoreFront, which is a standard and good 
starting point for new WooCommerce users. The theme has been developed 
by the developers of WooCommerce themselves. Navigate to Appearance 
| Themes and click Add New. Type Storefront in the search box and hit 
Enter. Click the Install button and activate the theme after installation.

Summary
For this moment, we've covered the most important settings and we're ready 
to move to the next step. We've learned to setup a test environment and install 
WooCommerce, use the WooCommerce settings to setup our store in a way that 
fits our needs. Make the store available in our menu and install a WooCommerce 
compatible theme for our test environment.
In the next chapter, we will create our very first products.

[ 33 ]
Creating Your First Products
Now that WooCommerce is up and running and we had a look at its settings it's 
time to start creating a couple of products and build our online store. WooCommerce 
offers several possibilities to create your product catalog. In this chapter, we'll stick 
to the basics. You'll learn to:
•	
Setting up product categories
•	
Creating your first product
•	
Setting the categories, tags, and images for your product
•	
Learning about the other product types
Setting up product categories
When setting up your product catalog, it often makes sense to create Categories 
for your products, even if you have not so many products. Using a clear category 
structure makes it easier for your visitors to navigate and search your store. Further 
on you can use Tags and Attributes in your product catalog. Categories and Tags 
work in the same way you're used to from WordPress itself. Attributes are important 
for more complex product types. For instance, if I have a category for women's 
dresses, I could add Attributes for size and color. We'll discuss that in more depth 
in Chapter 3, Using Downloadable Products and Variations. Besides this, Attributes can 
also be used to add additional information to simple products.

Creating Your First Products
[ 34 ]
For now, we'll just set up our category structure. Let's assume we are going to sell 
apparel in our store. We could start with three main categories in that case: Women, 
Men, and Children. If you're used to working with categories for (blog) posts in 
WordPress, you'll have no problem in creating them for your products. To create 
categories, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click in the left menu on Products | Categories. A form opens that lets you 
create a new category immediately.
2.	 Just fill in the Name of your category. If you want to you may change the 
Slug field that is used to create the link to your product category. If you 
do not enter a slug, it will automatically be created for you. In that case the 
category name is used, where spaces are replaced by hyphens.
3.	 Leave the Parent field to None. This is the first category we create, so 
automatically this field gives you no other choice.
4.	 You may use the description for your own purposes. There are themes that 
actively use the description of the category, but that isn't always the case. 
Note that WooCommerce does not accept the usage of shortcodes and/or 
HTML in the description field.
5.	 It's possible to add a thumbnail image to your category as well. Also in here, 
it depends on the WordPress theme whether or not this image is used on the 
product category page. If your theme doesn't show them, more experienced 
users can change the theme code to add them: http://docs.woothemes.
com/document/woocommerce-display-category-image-on-category-
archive/. Still in doubt? Don't worry, you can always come back later here 
and adjust the settings of your categories.
6.	 Hit the Save button to store the category.

Chapter 2
[ 35 ]
Now that our first category has been created it's easy to add some more. Also we can 
create the next levels, by choosing one of the top categories for the Parent field. A 
simplified category structure could look like this:
Creating your first product
Once we've created some categories, it's time to start entering our first product. 
Click Products | Add Product in the menu on the left. Looking at the categories we 
created, most of the products will require sizing and colors as well. That's something 
we'll discuss later on, so for now we are going to create a simple women's belt in the 
category Accessories.

Creating Your First Products
[ 36 ]
In the example below you'll see that we already pre-filled a lot of information, just to 
give  an idea of the fields you need to start with:

Chapter 2
[ 37 ]
Let's have a closer look at all the available fields:
•	
Start with the product name on the top. Make sure to use important key 
words in this field. The permalink will automatically be created, just as with 
regular WordPress posts, but you may change it if you want to.
•	
In the editor underneath that, you may type the description of your product. 
Please note: this is the long description, which will be displayed at the 
bottom of your product page! The Short Description is more important, 
because that one will be displayed near your Add to Cart button. Strangely 
enough, this field can be found at the bottom of this page. You can move it 
to another spot on the page by dragging it, but you cannot move it above the 
long description. Also, in both description fields, make sure that important 
key words are mentioned to improve rankings in the search engines. It 
makes sense to fill both description fields at once and continue with all other 
product data after that.
•	
Below the description fields, there's an area containing a lot of fields that are 
important to understand. Using this area, you can control how your product 
will behave.
If you want to do more on the optimization of your online store for 
the search engines, we highly recommend using the SEO plugin of 
Joost de Valk (Yoast). It's a general SEO plugin for WordPress, but 
it works fine with WooCommerce as well. You may find it here: 
http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/.

Creating Your First Products
[ 38 ]
General data
The first tab in the area with product data is active by default and is named General. 
Just above that, you will notice that it's possible to select a Product Type and that there 
are two checkboxes available: Virtual and Downloadable. These are all items that will 
be discussed in Chapter 3, Using Downloadable Products and Variations. For this moment, 
we'll stick to the Simple products. These are suitable for anything that is a regular, 
physical product, without the need for the buyer to choose options or variables. For 
instance, a t-shirt available in different sizes is not a simple product, but a variable 
product. Let's take a closer look at the available fields for our simple product:
The parameters in the General tab are as follows:
•	
SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit, also referred to as item- or article 
number. You may choose one yourself or just use the codes your supplier 
is using. Make sure to use a unique code. In most themes the SKU is also 
shown to the customer.
•	
The Regular Price is the sales price of your product, that your customers will 
see in the front end of your store. In case of a promotion you may use a Sale 
Price, for which it's also possible to enter a Schedule, so that the offer is only 
valid on certain dates.
•	
Depending on the settings you chose earlier in Chapter 1, Setting Up 
WooCommerce, for calculating taxes, you should choose whether or not the 
calculation of taxes is applicable for this product using the Tax Status. If a 
product is Taxable, also select the correct Tax Class. Using the Tax Class it's 
possible to work with different tax calculations, based on the type of product.

Chapter 2
[ 39 ]
Inventory data
Moving to the next tab, we'll find a couple of settings that control the way we're 
handling stock levels for this product:
The parameters in the Inventory tab are as follows:
•	
First, decide if it's necessary to manage stock levels at all for this item. It's not 
always necessary to do so, if you've a small shop with only a couple of items. 
If you check the Manage stock? field, the Stock Qty field automatically 
becomes visible. In there enter the stock level you have available at the 
moment of creating your product.
•	
Decide if you want to be able to accept backorders from your customer if 
an item is no longer on stock. If you do, consider that customers might start 
asking you questions about the delivery date of the item they ordered.
•	
Next, make sure that the item's Stock status is set to In stock.
Note: The product stock status can be used even if enable stock 
management is disabled in WooCommerce main products settings, 
which we discussed in Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce.
•	
Finally, there's a parameter named Sold Individually. If you check it, your 
customers will only be able to add one of this item to their order.

Creating Your First Products
[ 40 ]
Shipping data
Sometimes you need to be able to add additional information to your product, 
because shipping possibilities or rates might depend on the weight and size  
of your product.
The parameters in the Shipping tab are as follows:
•	
Just enter the Weight and Dimensions if they are important for shipping, or 
if they are important for your customers to know. Note that premium carriers 
like for example UPS or FedEx require this information in most cases. The 
weight and dimensions are shown on the product page to your customer. 
Remember that the units of measure for the item's weight and dimensions 
can be set in the WooCommerce settings page.
•	
Select a Shipping class if the shipping rates are depending on the product 
that is being sold. More on shipping calculations will follow in Chapter 4, 
Payments, Shipping, and Coupons.
Linked products and attributes
Since this is our first product, we can skip the Linked Products and Attributes tabs 
for this moment. We'll use those later on.
We'll be using attributes a lot during the next chapter, when we'll be discussing more 
complex product types. The usage of attributes often even makes sense for simple 
products. Attributes offer a way to store structured product data in a way that it 
can be used for searching and filtering products. Instead of entering for instance 
the fabric as text, we could create an attribute for it. Using that method will give 
more possibilities to your customers to filter your product catalog. Besides that the 
attributes will be shown to the customer in the front end on the product page, in the 
More information tab.

Chapter 2
[ 41 ]
Refer to Chapter 3, Using Downloadable Products and Variations, for more information 
on using attributes.
Advanced data
There are a few interesting fields in the Advanced tab:
•	
The Purchase Note will be included in any order for this product. It will also 
appear on the Order Receipt e-mail your customer will receive.
•	
Using the Menu order, you can influence the way your products are  
ordered. Note that this function depends on the settings you made during 
Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce, If the Default Product Sorting field in 
your WooCommerce settings has been set to Default sorting, the Menu order 
field becomes active. You can enter any numeric value into this field, where 
the product with the lowest value will be displayed first on your shop page.
•	
Make sure that the Enable reviews field is checked. Having good, genuine 
reviews on your store is an important reason for potential customers to buy 
as well.
Setting the categories, tags, and images 
for your product
We're almost there now. Under the product data section there's a possibility to use 
custom fields that we also know from regular WordPress posts. We do not need 
that now. Always first try if you can solve your need using the standard available 
Attributes and Tags.

Creating Your First Products
[ 42 ]
So far we've just used the main part of the product creation page. On the right there 
are the well known fields to publish the item. But before we do, we first need to 
take care of some other data, starting with the Product Categories. Just as with any 
regular WordPress post, just click the categories your product belongs to. Note that 
it's possible to select more than one category.
Next, set the Product Tags by entering them in the field and just press Enter. Don't 
use too many tags per product, stick to using a few. Having too many tags might 
lead to duplicate content, because the chance of having multiple pages with the 
same content increases in that case.
What is duplicate content? We speak of duplicate content if your 
website has the exact same content under two or more different 
URLs. You need to prevent that from happening, because search 
engines like Google won't know which page to show. The problem 
becomes bigger when people start linking to the different versions 
of the (same) content. Using too many tags for your posts increases 
the chance of having duplicate content. Joost de Valk from Yoast.
com wrote some exceptional detailed information on this topic: 
https://yoast.com/duplicate-content/.
In the next screenshot you see an example of as well the selected categories as some 
tags that were entered for this product.

Chapter 2
[ 43 ]
Below the Product Tags, there are two areas that allow you to add two of images to 
your product: the Product Gallery and the Featured Image. Before we start adding 
images, let's go back to the first chapter. Remember that we crossed a couple of 
settings that influence our image sizes? If you want to go back there now, first save 
your product as a draft and then go to WooCommerce | Settings | Products | 
Display using the menu. The image settings are on the bottom of that tab:
There are three image sizes that will be used by WooCommerce:
•	
Catalog images is the image that is used in your category and tag pages, 
when visitors are browsing through your product catalog
•	
Single Product Image is shown on the product page, showing a single item
•	
Product Thumbnails are only shown in your cart and checkout
It is important to use the same ratio for all three sizes. It's not mandatory to keep the 
width and height the same, the portrait format (where the value for width is smaller 
than the value for height) is often used as well, especially on fashion websites.
The check box at the field hard crop means that if you upload an image with a different 
ratio, they will automatically be cropped to the correct ratio as set here. This might 
mean losing a part of your image. Therefore it's always good to just prepare your 
images before uploading them to your website. Use the correct image ratio and use an 
image size that is at least as large at the dimensions of the Single Product Image.

Creating Your First Products
[ 44 ]
Note: Not sure which values to use? Before you make final settings and 
start filling your product catalog with lots of items, it's important that 
you have set these values correctly. If you're buying a theme for a store, 
the documentation of the theme will often explain what to use. If you're 
creating a theme yourself, you're completely free in your choices of 
course. Sometimes it's necessary to regenerate all your product images, 
just because you changed the settings previously after you created your 
products. As also mentioned in Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce, 
there's a plugin that can help you with this task: http://wordpress.
org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/.
We're heading back to our product to start adding our images. The first and most 
important image is the Featured Image. Just add that by clicking on the link Set 
Featured Image. This will open your media library, just like you are used to from 
creating WordPress posts or pages.

Chapter 2
[ 45 ]
Click Select files and open a single image from your local machine. Don't forget to 
set a Alt Text and Description. Those are important for search engines! Then click 
the Set featured image button on the right. You'll return to the product maintenance 
page. If you have multiple photos available, don't hesitate to add those as well. Lack 
of good product photos is for sure a conversion killer. Click Add product gallery 
images and add the images you have available. Again, also for these images fill the 
Alt Text and Description fields. The result looks something like this:

Creating Your First Products
[ 46 ]
We finished the most important steps for our product and can publish it on the 
top right by clicking the button Publish. Of course we also want to have a look at 
the result in the front-end of our store. You may open the product page directly by 
clicking the button View Product on the top of the product screen.
Since we are using the default Twenty Fifteen theme here, the layout of the page 
is okay but not more than that. Things could be better if we'd used an optimized 
WooCommerce theme. More on that topic will follow during Chapter 5, Working  
with WooCommerce Themes.
Product visibility options
When publishing our product there are some more options that we can use to 
influence the behavior of WooCommerce for this product. First navigate back to your 
product and edit it. On the top right we see several default WordPress fields, that 
we already know from regular posts like Status, Visibility, and Published on. The 
behavior of these fields is exactly the same as for a regular WordPress post and gives 
you the possibility to control if and when a product becomes visible.

Chapter 2
[ 47 ]
Next, click on the Edit link near Catalog visibility, as shown in the following 
screenshot:
The default value, Catalog/search will have as result that:
•	
Your product is shown on the shop and category pages
•	
Your product will be shown in the search result if a visitor is searching for it
The other possibilities are:
•	
Catalog: In this case the product appears on the shop and category pages, but 
it will not be shown in search results.
•	
Search: In this case the product is not shown on shop and category pages. It 
can only be found by a visitor by searching for it.
•	
Hidden: A product with the value hidden will never be shown to your 
visitors and is only accessible if you know the exact URL. This can be handy 
if you would like to offer a product to for instance your e-mail subscribers, 
but do not want to make the product publicly available.

Creating Your First Products
[ 48 ]
Just above the Ok button, there's a checkbox to make your product a Featured 
Product. Featured Product allows you to showcase specific products in different 
parts of your online store. You can for example show featured products in a slider on 
your homepage or in a widget. We'll show those possibilities later on in this book:
Remember to click the Update button if you make any changes to your product.
Summary
During this chapter, we have learned to create our very first products in 
WooCommerce. We have seen how to use the most important WooCommerce  
fields to determine the behavior of our product.
In the next chapter, we will be adding more complex products and learn how to use 
attributes to create them.

[ 49 ]
Using Downloadable 
Products and Variations
Our first product is available and we could easily continue using the same method 
to create multiple products in the same way. However, WooCommerce offers more 
possibilities than we just learned. In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:
•	
Working with tags
•	
Virtual products
•	
Downloadable products
•	
Using attributes
•	
Setting up variable products
•	
Grouped products

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 50 ]
Working with tags
We've mentioned the usage of product tags already in Chapter 2, Creating Your First 
Products. Using tags works exactly in the same way that you're used to when writing 
WordPress posts. So in here, we do not want to spend too much time in explaining 
the concept.
Just be aware that Product Tags and Tags for Posts are actually separated from each 
other. You may find the tags that you already used by navigating to Products | Tags 
in the menu on the left-hand side of your screen. Note that the tags that you entered 
during product creation appear here. Besides that, it's also possible to create a list of 
tags immediately in the Edit Product screen and use them later on. In general, when 
using a new tag, always ask yourself: Will this be a tag that I'll use more often?. If the 
answer is yes, go ahead and use it. If the answer is no, then it's better not to create 
that tag.
Virtual products
This product type is used for non-physical products. Use it to sell services, for 
instance. Virtual products will not be shipped, and as soon as you mark a simple 
product as virtual, the Shipping tab will disappear from the Product Data area. 
Besides that, if a customer only buys one or multiple virtual products in their order, 
the shipping address will be removed from the Checkout process:

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
Note: In the preceding screenshot, the Virtual field can only be set for a Simple 
product. If you need a variable product to be virtual, that's still possible but not 
using this field.
Downloadable products
If you have digital goods to offer to your customers, WooCommerce supports this 
using the Downloadable product type. Often, you'll also want to mark these items 
as Virtual since you won't physically ship anything. On the other hand, if your 
item will be as well downloaded as shipped, you should not check the Virtual field. 
An example could be a book that is physically shipped, but where the buyer also 
receives a downloadable copy.

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 52 ]
Once the Downloadable field has been checked, new fields become available in the 
General tab. Click on Add file, followed by the Choose file button to upload, and 
attach a digital file to your product:
You may also set the Download limit, which determines how often a customer can 
come back to download the same item again.
Besides that, you can set the Download expiry. Fill in the number of days that the 
download stays available for your customer after purchase. By default, both fields 
are blank, which means that there are no restrictions and your customers can always 
come back to download the purchased items again.
When using the Download limit or Download expiry fields, please 
note the following: if you ever need to change or replace an existing 
file, the download expiry and limit will be reset as it's technically 
a new file. Which means that the user can download the file again 
from their account or original e-mail.

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
Finally, the field Download type can contain the value Standard Product, 
Application/Software, or Music. If there's no fit for your product then leave it to 
Standard Product. This field controls the markup of your product page. To the end 
user, this field isn't visible, but it will tell the search engines what type of content the 
product contains. Unfortunately, the book type isn't supported in WooCommerce 
yet. More information can be found at http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html.
When your customer purchases a downloadable file, a link to download the item 
will be sent to the customer via an e-mail. But only if you enabled this e-mail in the 
WooCommerce settings. The link will also become available in the My Account 
section for that customer.
Whether or not a customer is forced to create an account in your store depends on 
the settings. Head over to WooCommerce | Settings | Products to check the settings 
for Downloadable products. See Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce, for more 
information on these fields.
More information on using Downloadable products is available at the 
WooCommerce documentation website: https://docs.woothemes.com/document/
digitaldownloadable-product-handling/.

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 54 ]
Using attributes
At first glance, attributes look like tags when we're accessing the function using the 
menu, Products | Attributes:
However, there is an important difference between Attributes and Categories. 
Attributes deliver a powerful mechanism to create different kinds of products. 
Besides that, working with Attributes is often smarter than working with Categories 
alone. Categories are used to organize entire products, whereas Attributes are a way 
of organizing product properties. Let's start with an example to clarify this.
Our simple product that we created earlier (the Brown Women's Belt) could easily be 
put in a category structure like: Women | Accessories | Belts. But that would give 
us all available belts in your store, right? And not just the brown ones. Ok, so we'll 
add another category for that! But no, although it is possible, it's not the best way 
to do it. Using Attributes in such a situation for the color is much more powerful. It 
will give your visitors the possibility to immediately filter all brown products once 
they're in the Accessories category so they can mix and match. Using categories for 
describing the color of your product is really a no-go. In other words, a category 
is a group in which a set of products can be bundled together. An attribute is a 
specific characteristic of a product. Other products may share that characteristic (for 
example, multiple products can be a medium size or have a brown color).
Since the usage of colors in our fashion store example is something that we'll need 
for sure, we are going to create that Attribute.

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
Creating an Attribute is very simple. Just enter the Name of the attribute (Color, 
in our example). You may leave the Slug field empty, it will automatically be filled 
based on the name of your attribute. Next, make sure that the Type field is set to 
Select. If you would set it to Text, it will give you the possibility to add values for 
every single product manually. Using Select will make sure that you enter and 
standardize the values beforehand. In most cases, using Select is the better choice.
The Enable Archives checkbox may stay switched off. This field allows you to 
create separate pages based on your attributes. So for instance, a page holding all 
the products in your store that are black. This can be handy, but also requires some 
additional coding to reach the desired result.
Leave Default sort order to Custom ordering so that later on, we'll be able to sort 
our Attribute values in the way we want to.
Click on the Add Attribute button:

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 56 ]
Now that our Attribute has been created, it appears in the table on the right-hand 
side of the screen:
Click on the button on the right to Configure terms.
Next, add all the colors that you will possibly need in your store. Don't worry 
though, it's always possible to come back later and add more. For every color, just 
enter the name and click on Add New Color. You'll soon have a long list of colors 
available. Remember that these colors will be used later on, when we're creating  
new products.

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
Once done, go back to the Attributes form again by clicking in the menu on the left. 
Now repeat the preceding steps and create a new Attribute named Size or Shoe 
Size. When working with sizes, there are a lot of different possibilities, so you might 
want to distinguish the sizes depending on the products that you are going to use 
them for. We create Shoe size to support our next example. Our result looks like this:
Now that we created some attributes, we'll be able to create a Variable Product.
The attributes we created here will be available for all products. 
That's a good thing for attributes that will be used often. However, 
on the product level, we'll see later on that it is also possible to add 
attributes which are used for that product only and not shared 
with others.
Setting up variable and grouped products
We've just created our first attributes that we'll use to add some shoes to our 
women's fashion store. Of course, we do not want to display all the sizes as 
individual products. We want to show our visitors one product and let them choose 
the right color and size. This is done using a variable product. To create a variable 
product, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start by creating a new product. Add a long and short description, select 
the correct category or create one, and assign a couple of tags. Set a featured 
image that will appear in your product category page.

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 58 ]
2.	 Next, in the Product Data area, select Variable product as the product type:
3.	 Note that some fields have disappeared; it's no longer possible to add the 
product price here. The SKU field is still available, but normally, you would 
leave it empty and set individual SKUs at a lower level. We'll see that in a 
minute. On the Inventory tab, Enable the Manage Stock? field, but do not 
set the Stock Qty field. Later on, we'll add the stock levels for individual 
products. Skip the other tabs for now and head over to the Attributes tab:
4.	 Click on the drop down that says Custom product attribute, select Color, 
and click on the Add button.
5.	 Next, check the fields, Visible on the product page and Use for variations. 
This will make sure that our visitors will be able to see this attribute, and 
we'll be able to create multiple instances (variations) of our product using 
different colors.

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
Note: if you would just select Visible on the product page, the 
attribute would become visible to the customer as a property of 
this item. But as information only, you would not be able to use 
that attribute when creating variations of your product.
6.	 On the right, click into the Value(s) field and select the colors that you want 
to use for this product. To keep things a little bit simple for our example, we 
just select Blue and Grey:
7.	 We repeat the same steps for our Shoe Size attribute, but now we push the 
Select All button to immediately select all the available shoe sizes. The final 
result will look as follows:

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 60 ]
8.	 Click on the Save Attributes button on the bottom left of the Attributes tab. 
Or alternatively, save the draft of your product in the top-right corner of the 
product screen. Next, head over to the Variations tab. If you forget to save 
your attributes before moving on to the Variations tab, the following error 
message will appear:
9.	 Return to the Variations tab and note that now some fields have become 
visible. Click on the drop down and select Create variations from all 
attributes to assign all the possible combinations of colors and sizes at once. 
It's also possible to add them one by one in case you do not have all the 
possible combinations of the attribute values available. Click on Go:
10.	 WooCommerce will give you a warning message because this may create a 
large number of combinations (two colors having five different sizes makes a 
total of 10 variations). Click on Ok. Another message appears mentioning the 
number of created variations. Click on Ok again.

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
There's a limit of 50 variations per run. Please note that you should 
not create too many variations. If you would have more than 100, 
the chances are high that you'll be creating a complex product for 
your customers. For more complex products, there are additional 
plugins available to support that. Refer to Chapter 8, More Possibilities 
Using Plugins, for more information.
11.	 A large area with all the variations will now be displayed. Click on one of the 
rows to expand all the underlying fields of that variation. Note that it's now 
possible to set a number of fields for every variation individually. The price 
may differ, the available Stock Qty may differ, and you can set an individual 
SKU for every variation. It's also possible to assign a different image per 
variation. Start filling in your variations individually. If a field is set to  
the value Same as parent, then the variation holds the same value as the 
parent item.

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 62 ]
12.	 You may also use the handy Bulk Edit function on top to change fields for 
all the variations. That function is a bit hidden in the current WooCommerce 
version, but you may find it by clicking the drop down at the top that 
currently still says Create variations from all attributes. For example, when 
creating our demo shoe product, generally all the sizes will have the same 
sales price. We could enter them one by one for every variation, but it's much 
faster to do them all at once using the function, Set regular prices:
13.	 We normally work this way to set everything  we need, but your situation 
may differ depending on your products of course:
°°
Set the field Regular Price for all the products at once using the Bulk 
Edit function.
°°
Click on the little image area to set a separate product image per 
variation. In our demo product, we need this to be able to show a 
different image depending on the color that the user chooses. So, 
if the user selects the shoes in blue, we want that automatically 
the product image changes to the blue variation. You reach this by 
assigning an image to every single variation.
°°
Set the SKU, Image, and Stock Qty individually for every variation, 
assuming that the stock quantities are not all the same.

Chapter 3
[ 63 ]
°°
The following image below shows the Bulk edit option to change the 
regular sales price for all the variations at once:
14.	 The result should look something like this:

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 64 ]
15.	 The last step that we have to take now is to publish the product in the  
top-right corner of the screen.
Note: if you made a mistake creating your variations, you can 
individually delete them by using the Remove button or use the Bulk 
Edit function again to delete them all at once. It isn't possible to set the 
image for all the variations at once, but be aware that, in fact, you only 
have to set this image for the variations where the image differs from 
the one that you set earlier as Featured Image on the main product 
level! If you do not set an image for your variation, WooCommerce will 
simply show the featured image of the main product.
16.	 Now that we published our product, of course, we want to see the end result 
in the frontend:
Note that the image that is shown automatically updates if the visitor selects 
a different color. If that doesn't happen, in your situation it's a problem of the 
WordPress theme and not an issue in WooCommerce. Are you thinking about 
changing the way this product page looks like? In Chapter 5, Working with 
WooCommerce Themes, we'll learn how to adjust the look and feel of our store.

Chapter 3
[ 65 ]
You probably noticed that the Add to cart button does not become available if no 
variation has been chosen yet. To overcome this problem, you can set a default form 
value for your product in the backend so that it will be displayed immediately:
When working with a product with lots of variations, there's something important 
that you need to know about the product page your visitors see. Because of 
performance reasons, WooCommerce does not load the availability of all the 
variations if you have over 20 variations in a single product. In such a case, the 
attributes of the variation will be loaded using Ajax once a variation is selected by 
the user. This might mean that the user sees a certain color or size, but that it actually 
isn't available anymore. WooCommerce will show a message to the user in that case. 
Below 20 variations this issue doesn't exist.
Also in the WordPress administration, this limitation of 20 variations becomes 
visible. Pagination has been added on the top and bottom of the list with variations. 
This has been done to make sure that the number of items that must be loaded 
at once is manageable. Loading lots of variations was a former issue within 
WooCommerce, where products became very slow in the WordPress backend. This 
has been solved as of WooCommerce version 2.4.

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 66 ]
Other product types
If you paid some attention to the screenshots earlier in this chapter, you would have 
noticed that there are even more product types available in WooCommerce. Besides 
Simple and Variable products, we can create the following:
•	
Grouped products: Think about a package, like for instance, a complete set 
that contains a computer, monitor, and mouse. Or a fashion set that includes 
a dress and matching shoes.
•	
External/Affiliate products: This is a special kind of product, which is 
actually sold on another website.
Grouped products
To create a grouped product, just simply select the type at the top of the Product 
Data area:
Fields that are no longer necessary will be removed. For instance, note that for a 
Simple product, there are various settings to control the stock levels. For a Grouped 
product, this isn't the case. You can only set the group to in stock or out of stock.
Unfortunately, it's not possible to set a sales price for the group. In your product 
catalog, WooCommerce will display From $xx, where xx is the price for the 
individual item with the lowest sales price. The final price that your customers pay 
will be calculated automatically, by adding the total sales prices of the individual 
products that your customer selects. In fact, the grouped item will display the 
individual items of the group together. Your customer is still in control of the items 
that will be put in the basket. Finish your product and create individual (simple) 
products that will belong to this group.

Chapter 3
[ 67 ]
When creating the individual products for your group, please note the following:
•	
Do you want to sell this Simple product individually as well or only as a 
part of the Grouped product? Depending on your needs, set the appropriate 
value in the Catalog Visibility field in the top-right corner. In this example, 
I've set the visibility to Hidden so that this product can only be sold as part 
of the group.
•	
To link your individual product to the group, click on the Linked Products 
tab and select the correct grouped product by typing a part of its name:

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 68 ]
The end result of the grouped product in the frontend could look as follows:
Note that the user has to enter the number of items he wants for every simple 
product. Often, that doesn't make sense. If you need more functionality for your 
grouped products, then you'll have to add additional plugins to WooCommerce.
External/Affiliate products
This last product type that WooCommerce offers is a special one. As you probably 
know, affiliate marketers promote products of other websites. Using this product 
type, you can create products that are actually sold elsewhere. As a site owner, you'll 
often earn a percentage of the sale. This product type is popular among bloggers 
since it gives them the possibility to monetize their blog without having to create a 
full featured online store and keep stock levels themselves.
When creating such a product, the Product URL is the most important field. It 
redirects the visitor to the store that the product is actually sold in, including a 
unique code. Using this code, the seller will know that this buyer came from your 
website and you will receive your affiliate fee if that customer closes the sale.

Chapter 3
[ 69 ]
If you use your products in this way, the buyer will no longer be able to add an item 
to the cart. They will simply be redirected to the original store.
Note: if you want to use WooCommerce for affiliate marketing 
purposes, there are lots of possibilities to integrate with large 
Affiliate networks. Every country has its own affiliate partners 
available. Larger retailers have their own affiliate programs 
available, like Amazon.com for instance.
Importing product data
When you need to create a lot of products, it's good to take a closer look at the 
possibilities to import products automatically to your WooCommerce store.
The plugin WP All Import will, for example, deliver the possibility to import product 
data from XML and CSV sources (http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-
xml-csv-product-import/).
WooThemes is also offering a plugin to import products using a CSV file named 
Product CSV Import Suite (http://www.woothemes.com/products/product-csv-
import-suite/).

Using Downloadable Products and Variations
[ 70 ]
Both plugins have a similar price range. They aren't cheap, but they can save a lot 
of time if you need to create hundreds of products. Based on your needs, WP All 
Import might be a bit cheaper. WP All Import proves to be more flexible, especially if 
you're also working with the plugin Advanced Custom Fields. Or if you would like 
to use the plugin for other import tasks as well. It is a more generic import solution, 
where the Product CSV Import Suite is just used for importing products. A pro of the 
Product CSV Import Suite plugin is that it's also able to export data. Both solutions 
can do the job, so just check which one best fits your needs.
Summary
In this chapter, we've learned to create more complex products in WooCommerce. 
We need this to be able to create products with for example colors and sizes, but also 
if we're selling services or digital items. WooCommerce offers various possibilities 
using downloadable, virtual, variable, and grouped products. It's even possible to 
combine these techniques and create a variable, downloadable product.
If you need to create lots of products, there are various plugins available to help you 
getting the job done.
Now that we've covered everything about using products, it's time to take a closer 
look at shipping and payment methods in the next chapter.

[ 71 ]
Payments, Shipping,  
and Coupons
You now have enough knowledge of the product possibilities WooCommerce has to 
offer. You may continue to add multiple categories and products to fill your product 
catalog. Next, we'll need to take a closer look at the shopping process your customers 
will be offered. In this chapter we'll have a closer look at:
•	
Setting up Payment methods
•	
Using PayPal
•	
Using Stripe for credit card acceptance
•	
Setting the Shipping methods and prices
•	
Using discount coupons
Payment methods
Earlier in this book, during Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce, we skipped the 
areas about handling the payment and shipping methods. These are both important 
subjects for your online store that deserve additional attention. Let's start with the 
payment methods that you'll offer to your customers.
Payment methods around the world
Which payment methods should you offer in your store? First of all, there's no 
best answer to this question. Looking at the payment solutions that are available 
worldwide, you might be surprised. There are literally hundreds of possibilities.

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 72 ]
When speaking of payment methods, we distinguish between the following types:
•	
Online or onsite methods: the transaction is done online immediately at 
moment of creating the order by your customer. Payment by credit card or 
PayPal are examples of online payment methods.
•	
Offline or offsite methods: these payment methods do not authorize or 
capture the order amount online. In this scenario the user will pay in a 
different way, for example by doing a manual bank transfer or by paying at 
moment of delivery of the ordered items.
The methods that you need to offer to your customers will differ from country to 
country. Especially if you're selling locally (within a specific country), you need to 
prepare your store for that market. If you're not sure which payment methods you 
should offer, just look at the methods other online stores in your market are offering. 
Here are some, possibilities, but be aware that the list below only cover the most 
important, widely used payment possibilities:
•	
Credit Card
•	
Debit Card
•	
Bank transfer
•	
Cash on delivery
•	
Pay after delivery
•	
Cheques
•	
Online wallets
This list explains something about the payment methods, but not about the Payment 
Provider yet. A payment provider allows the online store to accept payments in 
different forms and will authorize the transactions. Often they also provide an online 
tool to manage your funds. Just to mention some of the major players:
•	
PayPal
•	
Amazon
•	
Google (Google Checkout, Google Wallet)
•	
Alipay (China)
•	
Credit card companies Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover
•	
Stripe
•	
And many others.

Chapter 4
[ 73 ]
It's important to understand the difference between a Payment Provider and a 
Payment Gateway. The Payment Provider is the company used to offer one or 
multiple Payment methods, which are in WooCommerce referred to as Payment 
Gateways. For example, PayPal is a Payment Provider, offering Payment Gateways 
like PayPal Pro, PayPal Express Checkout and PayPal Digital Goods. Often, a 
Payment Provider offers multiple Payment methods.
For your store it's likely that you need to offer a combination of payment 
possibilities. Let's first have a look at what WooCommerce has to offer  
by default. Navigate to WooCommerce | Settings | Checkout.
The Checkout Options were already discussed in Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce. 
Note that next to the screen with options, we can see the following payment methods:
•	
BACS (Direct Bank Transfer)
•	
Cheque
•	
Cash on Delivery
•	
PayPal
•	
Simplify Commerce

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 74 ]
In fact, the methods mentioned above are offline payment methods, except for 
PayPal and Simplify Commerce. PayPal is widely accepted. Simplify Commerce  
is at moment of writing only available for the USA and Ireland.
An offline payment method means that your customer can use that method if 
you offer it, but the actual payment is not carried out immediately. You'll have 
to manually check later on if you received the money from your customer. The 
offline method requires that your customer makes sure the payment is done. Online 
payment methods immediately do the payment transaction online, at the moment 
of sale. In most cases the payment is verified automatically and the order status in 
WooCommerce will be updated accordingly.
What you need to know about credit cards
When you want to accept credit cards in your store, you'll soon hear something 
about PCI compliancy. The issue is: if you let your customers enter their credit card 
details directly on your website, you must be PCI compliant. The downside is that 
getting your website PCI compliant is difficult to reach.
If you'd like to know more about this subject, the following website may be useful: 
http://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/.
So, how are we going to solve this? We still need to be able to accept credit cards in 
our store. Luckily, this is where the Payment Service Providers jump in. These are 
third-party companies handling the payment transactions for you in a secure way. 
Simplify Commerce that we just mentioned, is just one of the many options you 
have. However, your country of residence will influence the number of possibilities 
you can choose from.
Just by checking out the WooCommerce extensions page, you'll get an idea of 
what's possible for your market: http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/
woocommerce-extensions/.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
Select Payment Gateways and your country to receive an overview of available, 
payment extensions for WooCommerce:
The extensions to support Payment Service Providers aren't free at the WooThemes 
website. Sometimes the Payment Service Provider of your choice might offer a free 
extension for WooCommerce when you sign up. Just make sure that you check if 
it is available. Installing an extension works in the same way as with any regular 
WordPress plugin. After installing the plugin there's always some configuration  
that needs to be done. The steps you need to take differ per Payment Gateway.
The extensions at the WooThemes website can sometimes be pricey. But you will 
receive support and updates for a year, which can be a good reason still to choose 
for a WooThemes plugin. Alternatively, there are lots of WooCommerce compatible 
extensions offered at the CodeCanyon website: http://codecanyon.net/
category/wordpress/ecommerce/woocommerce. The quality of these plugins may 
differ, so please pay attention to the ratings and comments of other users.

[ 76 ]
It's wise to take some time to find the right Payment Service Provider for your 
market. Pay attention to the rates charged by the Payment Service Provider (as well 
transaction fees as monthly rates) and the way they will pay you after the transaction.
Setting up a contract with a Payment Service Provider of your choice and the way 
the setup is done in WooCommerce differs a lot. Therefore, in our example below, 
we've chosen to just stick to the default options of WooCommerce.
Setting up PayPal
Setting up PayPal in your WooCommerce store is very simple. Of course you first 
need to create a PayPal account if you do not yet have one at http://www.paypal.
com. Mark it as a business account and enter your bank account details to be able to 
transfer money from your PayPal account to your regular bank account.
Next, in WooCommerce, click PayPal at the top of the Payment Gateways tab

Chapter 4
[ 77 ]
Enter the e-mail address that you used to create your PayPal account:

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 78 ]
Note that you have the following possibilities:
•	
You can use a PayPal Sandbox function, to test your transactions, before 
your store is opened for customers. For more information about the Sandbox 
functions of PayPal, see https://developer.paypal.com/. When testing, 
you can also enable the Debug Log to receive detailed information about 
your transaction. Generally, you don't need this, the plugin should work out 
of the box.
•	
Use an Invoice prefix, that is used to create the transaction number. By 
default, this is WC (from WooCommerce), so you might want to use 
something different. Note that the invoice number will be sent to PayPal 
including the prefix. If you would be running multiple WooCommerce stores 
using one PayPal account, you need to use a different prefix for every store.
•	
Use Page styles, defined within your PayPal account, to be able to offer a 
non-standard look and feel of the PayPal checkout page. More information 
about using Page styles can be found here: https://www.paypal.com/
customize.
Note: regardless of the Payment Service Gateway you're using, make 
sure that you test your setup thoroughly. Don't hesitate to buy and 
pay for a product in your own store. It's important that you've actually 
checked the process completely, instead of assuming that it will work!
Setting up Stripe
Stripe is a payment method created for software developers. Meanwhile the service 
became more mature and is now available in more than 20 countries, among which 
the USA, Australia, and a part of Western Europe.
To be able to use Stripe, your website must use a SSL certificate. Without it, you 
cannot use Stripe in a production environment. If you'd like to receive more 
information on SSL: your hosting provider can help you. A good option could be 
Namecheap (https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates.aspx), 
which has a pretty good acceptance and is very affordable. Even better, but also 
more expensive is Digicert (https://www.digicert.com/buy-ssl-certificates.
htm). Note that Digicert also offers a lot of information on using SSL certificates.
After signing up for a Stripe account (http://stripe.com), you just have to confirm 
your e-mail address to get started. For WooCommerce, there are a couple of options. 
There's a plugin available at WooThemeshere: http://www.woothemes.com/
products/stripe/.

Chapter 4
[ 79 ]
There's also a free extension available through the WordPress.org website (https://
wordpress.org/plugins/stripe-for-woocommerce/). And that's the one we'll be 
using in our example below:
•	
First install the Stripe plugin for WooCommerce by uploading it to your 
WordPress installation or just download and install it directly from WordPress.
•	
After activating the plugin navigate to WooCommerce | Settings | Checkout.
•	
Copy your API keys from the Stripe website (https://dashboard.stripe.
com/account/apikeys) and paste them into your settings page:
•	
Enable Turn on testing, so that you can start with testing Stripe Credit card 
payments in your store.

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 80 ]
That's all you need to setup a working solution to accept credit cards on your 
website. The exact procedure for other payment gateways will differ, but generally 
the steps will look similar.
The mentioned, free plugin for working with Stripe currently 
doesn't work very well together with the Subscriptions plugin. If 
you need to sell subscriptions this plugin is not the best choice at 
moment of writing. More on working with subscriptions will follow 
in Chapter 8, More Possibilities Using Plugins.
For the other, offline Payment Methods, it's just a matter of enabling or disabling 
them as you please. You are able to change the description that your visitors will  
see for every payment method. The Cash on Delivery payment method also gives  
the possibility to connect it to a shipping method. That's useful so you'll be able  
to set a different price for using this method, since Cash on Delivery is often an 
expensive choice.
Shipping methods and prices
Just as with Payment Methods, we also need to think about the shipping methods 
we are going to offer to our customers. Where are we going to ship to? Do we charge 
our customers for it and if yes, does the amount depend on the shipping address, the 
weight of the products or both? Also in here we have to think about several aspects:
•	
Which carrier(s) are we going to use?
•	
Is there any integration needed of our orders with that carrier or will we 
work manually?
•	
What are our shipping prices and in which way are we going to calculate 
shipping to our customers?

Chapter 4
[ 81 ]
Looking at the functions WooCommerce is offering we see a similar screen as used 
for Payment Methods. There are a couple of settings that we need to check:
At the top of the screen we'll find all settings regarding shipping, which we already 
discussed during Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce.
Below the settings we'll find all standard available shipping methods. Every 
Shipping Method has a link on top of the screen that will bring us to the settings 
page for that Shipping Method. This is what WooCommerce has to offer by default:
•	
Flat Rate, a fixed amount of shipping costs for all orders.
•	
Free Shipping, speaks for itself.
•	
International Delivery, for customers outside of our own country. Similar to 
Flat Rate shipping. The amount does not differ per country.
•	
Local Delivery, for customers living near us. We could enter zip codes to 
specify when this method will be available.

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 82 ]
You may sort the table by dragging the various shipping methods around. 
This is useful because the sorting here will also be the sort order of shipping 
methods the user sees during checkout. Besides that, using the priority field 
you can control the order in which the shipping methods are selected. If two 
or more Shipping Methods have the same priority, the one with the lowest 
cost will be selected first.
•	
Local Pickup. Instead of delivering the order, our customers could also pick 
it up of course. WooCommerce assumes that in this case there's no charge for 
our customer.
Let's take a closer look at the Flat Rate method, just to check how we need to 
configure it. Just click on the Flat Rate link at the top of your screen. The Flat Rate 
method will calculate one shipping rate per order, regardless of the weight and 
dimensions of the products in that order. The Flat Rate cannot differ per country, but 
the field Costs can contain a calculation, which means that the Flat Rate can also be a 
percentage of the total order value:
Some examples of a calculated Cost field could be:
•	
5 + ( 1 * [qty] ) Which would calculate $5 for every order plus $1 extra for 
every item in that order
•	
10 + [fee percent="10″ min_fee="2″] Would calculate a base amount of $10 
plus 10% of the order total with a minimum of $2

Chapter 4
[ 83 ]
Looking at the available Shipping Methods, we can imagine running short on 
possibilities. What if we need a Shipping Method that calculates the shipping rate 
based on the country, delivery address and the products that we'll ship? That's no 
longer a Flat Rate anymore and the other shipping methods do not offer a solution. 
In such a situation, WooCommerce needs additional extensions. A good and very 
flexible, but pretty expensive extension would be the Table Rate shipping plugin. 
It's available for $199 at the WooCommerce store: http://www.woothemes.com/
products/table-rate-shipping-2/.
Because of the higher price of the official WooThemes extension, there's room for 
alternative suppliers in the market.  On CodeCanyon, there's a reasonably priced 
plugin available. http://codecanyon.net/item/table-rate-shipping-for-
woocommerce/3796656. It's already been on the market for a while now and has  
a lot of users.

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 84 ]
Working with free shipping
Nowadays buyers often expect to receive free shipping when ordering items in your 
store. Shipping costs that are too high can be a reason for customers to leave your 
store and look for an alternative. WooCommerce offers a shipping method that gives 
the possibility to ship items for free. Let's have a look at the options:
•	
As with the other Shipping Methods, you must enable Free Shipping to be 
able to use it.
•	
Next, determine which countries you want to offer free shipping to, using the 
field Method availability:
•	
Choose if there are any requirements that must be met before offering free 
shipping. You have the choice to set this to the following options:
°°
A valid free shipping coupon. We'll see coupon creation later on in 
this chapter.
°°
A minimum order amount. If you choose this one, also set the value 
in the field below: Minimum Order Amount.
°°
A combination of these two, where you have the possibility to choose 
OR and AND. In case of OR just one of the two requirements needs 
to be met to receive free shipping. In case of AND both requirements 
must be met to receive free shipping.

Chapter 4
[ 85 ]
Using shipping classes
You must have noticed earlier in this book when creating products that there's a 
field named Shipping class that can be assigned to your products. A shipping class 
is nothing more than a connection between a product and a certain way of shipping. 
In other words, a shipping class can be assigned to a product. If we define multiple 
shipping classes, it becomes easier to use different shipping rates for different types 
of products. Defining shipping classes is just as easy as creating new categories. 
Just navigate in your WordPress menu on the left to Products | Shipping classes. 
Just enter a Name and Description for your class and click the button Add New 
Shipping Class:

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 86 ]
Once done, it's possible to set a rate per shipping class. Whether or not it is possible 
to set a rate per shipping class also depends on the shipping method. This way of 
working could be helpful when, for example, you're selling items of a higher value 
that need additional insurance:
In this example we see that, when an item is part of the shipping class Insurance, 
there's a cost of $20 for shipping ($5 + $15), instead of the regular $5. The Calculation 
Type makes sure that the higher cost is only calculated once for the complete order. 
It's also possible to calculate the additional fee for every item on the order having 
this specific shipping class.
Carrier integration
As with Payment Methods, there are lots of carriers on the market that offer 
integration with WooCommerce, so that you will not have to handle shipping 
transactions manually. There are too many possibilities to mention here, but there's 
always an extension needed to connect WooCommerce to a specific carrier.
If you're in need of integrating a carrier, head back to the WooCommerce website 
to check if there's an extension available: http://www.woothemes.com/product-
category/woocommerce-extensions/. For major player like UPS and FedEx, 
extensions are available, but these extensions will only calculate the correct shipping 
rates for these carriers.

Chapter 4
[ 87 ]
Using discount coupons
There's one more topic we would like to discuss in this chapter. Working with 
discount coupons gives you the possibility to organize promotions for your existing 
customers, subscribers, or any other target group. WooCommerce has the basic 
functionality on board to be able to work with discount coupons. You may find them 
in the menu by navigating to WooCommerce | Coupons:
To add a new coupon, click on the Add Coupon button at the top of the screen:
In the preceding example above we created a simple coupon that gives a 10% 
discount on the whole cart. To enable our coupon, we now simply need to hit  
the Publish button.
The Coupon function delivers several possibilities; let's go through the fields one  
by one:
•	
First of all, set the coupon code at the top of the screen. This is the code that 
your customers need to enter to be able to receive the discount. Keep it short.
•	
Next, enter a description for your coupon so that you will recognize it later on.

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 88 ]
•	
An important one is Discount type. You may choose to give a discount as a 
fixed amount per product, as a percentage of the sale price per product, as 
a fixed amount for the whole cart or as a percentage for the whole cart. We 
used this last one, the setting Cart % Discount.
•	
Below the type field, set the amount or percentage of discount you want to 
give in the Coupon amount field.
•	
Besides the mentioned possibilities for giving an amount or percentage of 
discount, it's also possible to offer free shipping to your customers using 
a coupon. Check Allow free shipping if you want to use this function. 
However, note that it's also needed to enable the Free Shipping method we 
saw earlier and set it so that a coupon must be used.
•	
Next, we can also enter a Coupon Expiry date, so that when that date is 
reached, the coupon will no longer work.
•	
Other options can be found by clicking on the tabs on the left named Usage 
Restriction and Usage Limits:
•	
You may restrict the coupon by entering a Minimum spend and/or 
Maximum spend, so that discount is only given to orders that meet these 
rules. Handy if you want to run a promotion like Receive 20% discount on all 
orders of $100 and over.

Chapter 4
[ 89 ]
•	
Check the Individual use only field if you want to prevent your customers 
from combining several coupon codes.
•	
Can your customers use the coupon to buy items that are already on sale? If 
not, check the Exclude sale items field.
•	
Next, we can limit our coupon code to certain products or categories, or 
even exclude certain products or categories from the promotion. Just choose 
whatever is most convenient in your situation. Note: you cannot mix these 
rules. For example, if you exclude a certain category, you cannot include a 
specific product in the same category. There would be a conflict between the 
two rules, which will not work.
•	
Use the Email restrictions field if you want to make this field available only 
to some specific customer(s). You must know the e-mail address they will 
use to place their order to be able to use this. WooCommerce uses the e-mail 
address entered in the checkout form for this restriction. That doesn't have to 
be the same one as the e-mail address on the customer's account.
•	
Finally, there are two more settings to limit the usage of our coupon. First, we 
can set how many times this coupon may be used. Note that the Usage limit 
per coupon setting works on store level, this won't stop a specific customer 
to use the same coupon code multiple times for different orders. If you want 
to prevent that from happening, use the Usage limit per user setting.

Payments, Shipping, and Coupons
[ 90 ]
At the Cart or Checkout, your customers will be asked to enter a coupon if they  
have one:
Note that the way this looks like completely depends on the theme you're using. 
Be aware that as soon as you enable the usage of coupons, potential customers that 
do not have one might be distracted and leave the cart to start searching for one. 
Sometimes it's just better to keep the function disabled, if you're not running any 
promotions where coupons are needed.
Once your customer applies the coupon to the order, the order review section looks 
as follows:

Chapter 4
[ 91 ]
After adding the coupon, your customer can delete the coupon code again by 
clicking the Remove link.
Depending on the settings of your coupons, it will be allowed or disallowed to use 
multiple coupons for the same order.
Summary
During this chapter we've learned to work with the default Payment possibilities 
WooCommerce is offering. However, every country is different and it's important 
that you use the right payment solution for your area. We've also learned how to 
use the functions WooCommerce offers to calculate shipping costs. Finally, we've 
worked with discount coupons, to be used for marketing purposes.
In the next chapter we are going to change the look and feel of our store. We'll have a 
closer look at WordPress themes, tailored to work with WooCommerce.


[ 93 ]
Working with  
WooCommerce Themes
So far we've been able to setup our online store, add different type of products and 
take the necessary steps to add payment and shipping methods. We already installed 
the free Storefront theme earlier, but our shop still looks very standard though. It's 
time to change the look and feel of our store!
In this chapter we'll cover:
•	
Using the available widgets and shortcodes
•	
Making or buying a theme
•	
Finding and selecting WooCommerce themes
•	
Using the free Storefront theme
•	
Changing the Storefront theme using the customizer
Using the available widgets and 
shortcodes
When you installed WooCommerce, you also received a number of possibilities 
that you can use to show products to your visitors. Of course there are the default 
available shop, category and product pages. But sometimes, you need more than 
that. Let's look at the other options that WooCommerce offers by default.

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 94 ]
WooCommerce offers the following widgets, that you can reach from the Theme 
customizer or via Appearance | Widgets:
•	
WooCommerce Layered Nav Filters
•	
WooCommerce Price filter
•	
WooCommerce Product Categories
•	
WooCommerce Products
•	
WooCommerce Product Search
•	
WooCommerce Product Tags
•	
WooCommerce Recently Viewed
•	
WooCommerce Recent Review
•	
WooCommerce Top Rated Products
The screenshot is as follows:

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
Using these widgets is easy and works just like any other WordPress widget. 
Using a couple of these in your sidebar gives your visitors the flexibility they need 
to find their way in your store. In the example below you see we activated the 
following widgets: WooCommerce Product Search, WooCommerce Products and 
WooCommerce Product Categories:
Note that the sidebar is on the right in this example. Generally it makes more sense 
in an online store to have such a sidebar on the left. This is something you can just 
set in the Storefront theme. Later on in this chapter we'll give you more information 
on customizing the Storefront theme.

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 96 ]
Making or buying a theme
The look and feel of your store is completely controlled by your WordPress theme. 
We already noticed that even a theme like Storefront already delivers good results. It's 
just better to use a theme that has been created with using WooCommerce in mind. If 
you would use a standard WordPress theme like Twenty Fifteen or Twenty Sixteen 
WooCommerce will still work, but layout issues might occur.
We have two possibilities when choosing a design for our store:
•	
Design and develop a theme from scratch. Or have someone do that for us
•	
Use a WooCommerce theme that is available on the market
To start with the first option, creating a theme ourselves is not something we 
could do overnight. It requires extensive knowledge of Web design, WordPress, 
WooCommerce, PHP, HTML, and CSS, Just to name a few. But maybe, if we wanted 
to have a unique design that no other shop is using, this could still be a good choice. 
It just requires more time and a large budget to do so. Creating your own WordPress 
or WooCommerce theme is a learning experience if you never did it before.
The alternative is using a standard theme. These are themes optimized for 
WooCommerce and available out of the box. Using a standard theme you can start 
right away. Some of them are even free, like for instance the good Storefront theme. 
We'll often find that we need a commercial theme though. Commercial or Premium 
themes can be found in price ranges from $20 to $200, where the majority of the 
themes will be offered below $100. If we had a small budget this would definitely be 
the way to go, since there are hundreds of themes to choose from. Remember that 
it's always possible to make adjustments on these themes, so that the theme of your 
choice better fits your needs.

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
Finding and selecting WooCommerce themes
If you decided to use a standard theme you'll face a new challenge: which theme 
will fit your needs? There are free themes available on the market, but most 
WooCommerce themes are commercial themes you'll have to pay for. Often they 
are referred to as Premium themes. These themes are supported by the developer 
and deliver lots of functions in most cases. That's not always a good thing though. 
Functionality should be provided by plugins and not within the theme itself. Besides 
that, having too much functions will just slow down your website. As a beginner this 
is sometimes difficult to judge. Just pick what you really need and do not go for the 
theme that offers the most functions. Look for themes that make it easy to customize 
the layout, colors and fonts. There are a number of resources available online to look 
for WooCommerce-compatible themes:
•	
The WooThemes website (http://www.woothemes.com) from the developers 
of WooCommerce. In fact, WooThemes exists much longer than their 
WooCommerce product, which is relatively young. Look at the demos to 
check how category and product pages will look like. The good thing of a 
theme created by WooThemes is that it will be an absolutely quality theme 
and compatible with WooCommerce. Themes found on WooThemes are 
not the cheapest ones. Pricing starts at around $80. Pay attention to the child 
themes. They have a low price, but also require the theme that it was built 
on. The following image shows a screenshot of Outlet, one of the available 
themes at WooThemes.com:

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 98 ]
•	
ThemeForest at http://themeforest.net/category/wordpress/
ecommerce/woocommerce. ThemeForest is a marketplace, where lots of 
developers are offering themes for WordPress and other solutions. There's a 
large range of WooCommerce enabled themes available. But please note that 
the quality may differ. Carefully look at the demos, the comments of other 
readers, and the last time that it was updated. Reasonably priced themes are 
around $60.
The image below shows the Integrity theme demo created using the X-theme, 
one of the many versatile and flexible WooCommerce themes  
at ThemeForest.com:
•	
Even cheaper themes can be found elsewhere on the Internet For instance 
at Elegantthemes (http://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/) or Mojo 
Themes (http://www.mojo-themes.com/categories/wordpress/
ecommerce-wordpress/woocommerce-themes/).

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
Sometimes, you may find free themes as well. The best resources are WooThemes 
and the WordPress.org website: http://wordpress.org/themes/. Search for 
WooCommerce if you're searching on WordPress.org. All themes can be used, but 
using a theme built for WooCommerce often gives better results out of the box. Be 
careful building your business on a free theme. Although it seems tempting if you're 
on a low budget, free themes are often not updated or supported. If there's any free 
theme we can really recommend, then it would be the Storefront theme, that is also 
used in this book. It is well written, and a good starting point if you want to learn 
WooCommerce theme development yourself. It is supported by WooThemes as well, 
which is an important asset for a free theme.
I also wrote a roundup of free WooCommerce themes on my blog. 
If you need to limit yourself to free themes, you should check it 
out. You may find it here:

Things you should pay attention to when 
buying a theme
If you're not yet very familiar with working with different WordPress themes, then 
the following guidelines may be helpful to come to a good choice:
•	
Browser compatibility: For users, this isn't always clear, but often older 
browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and older are no longer 
supported. This means that a visitor using such a browser will see a 
malfunctioning website. Depending on your audience, this is or isn't a 
problem. Just pay attention to it and make sure that you understand on 
which browsers and versions the theme of your choice will work.

[ 100 ]
•	
Smartphone/Tablet compatibility: Nowadays, when building a website, 
you have to consider how your site will look on mobile devices. Meet this 
requirement by looking for a Responsive WooCommerce theme. A website 
built with a responsive theme will look good on all devices, independent of 
their maximum screen resolution. Themes that are also Retina ready will look 
good on high resolution screens like the latest iPad 3 as well. See the example 
below of a responsive theme and how the look and feel will change if the 
website is visited using a mobile phone (on the right-hand side):
Theme developers almost always offer a demo site where you 
can check how the theme looks like. Don't forget to open this 
demo page with a tablet and mobile phone as well to get an idea 
of the layout on those devices.
•	
Is the theme compatible with the latest version of WooCommerce? Check 
the current version of the WooCommerce plugin and check if the theme 
developer guarantees that it will work. Also here, when buying a theme from 
WooThemes, there should be no incompatibility issues.
•	
When was the theme updated? Especially when buying from third party 
developers like on the ThemeForest marketplace, it's important to check if 
the developer is keeping the theme up to date. Having an updated theme is 
important. An older theme might not be compatible anymore with the latest 
WordPress and WooCommerce versions.

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
•	
How flexible is the theme from the functional point of view? For example, will 
you be able to easily change colors? Can you change the layout of the theme a 
bit without coding? Is there enough space in the header for your logo?
•	
What other functions are being delivered? Also important: do you really 
need all the functions that are being delivered in the theme? We often see 
themes with tons of functionality. Using such functions is handy, but your 
website might break if you're ever going to switch to a different theme. 
For example, we nowadays, regularly see themes with built-in functions 
for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). If you would switch themes in the 
future, you might even lose such data! Even if the theme offers functionality 
like this, it's better to take advantage of a separate SEO plugin. This will 
prevent the loss of data if you ever want to change to a different theme in  
the future.
There are a lot of things that we have to pay attention to when buying a 
WooCommerce theme. However, when creating a theme from scratch, we need to 
pay attention to some of these topics as well. In this case, we must have, or gather, 
the knowledge to be able to build it correctly.
Installing a WooCommerce theme
If you bought a commercial WooCommerce-compatible theme, you will have to 
install it through the WordPress administrative panel or upload it using FTP. Before 
we do so, let's first take a look at what we actually received. In almost all cases, you'll 
receive a ZIP file holding different folders. The content and names of the folders will 
differ from theme to theme. Still, it's good to have a closer look at it and get familiar 
with commercial theme packages.
An example of the contents of a downloaded theme can be found in the next screenshot:

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 102 ]
Note that this is just an example, coming from a ThemeForest WooCommerce theme 
named The Retailer. The folder structure of this theme shows that it differs from just 
a regular WordPress theme. There are separate folders holding Assets, the original 
Photoshop files and Demo data for instance. The actual theme files we need to install 
the theme have been placed in the folder theme files and we first need to extract 
(unzip) the whole package in order to be able to continue with our installation. 
Although the folder names will differ from theme to theme, this is an approach 
that you will see with lots of premium themes. Always look for a folder named 
Documentation and start reading this before doing anything else! Often, you'll see 
that the documentation is offered in an HTML format, starting with index.html that 
you should open using your browser. In the following screenshot, there's an example 
of such a documentation:
To install the theme, we head over to the WordPress administrator and choose 
Appearance | Themes in the menu. Click on Add New, and then click on the 
Upload Theme link:

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
Click on Choose file, and then browse to the folder where you unpacked the theme 
files a minute ago. We open the file theretailer.zip from the subfolder named 
Theme files and click on Install Now. Remember to upload the ZIP file and not the 
theme folder inside it.
Next, since this theme is already delivering a child theme, we'll install that one as 
well. We repeat the preceding steps for the file theretailer-child.zip. Note that 
we must do it in this order: first install the main or parent theme and after that the 
child theme. Besides that not every theme will deliver a child theme as well. Often, 
you'll just receive a single theme package.
Working with Child theme is a best practice if you need to make changes to your 
theme. By using a parent and child theme, we'll avoid losing our changes if the 
developer ever needs to update the theme—and this will happen. If the theme of your 
choice does not deliver a child theme in the package, it's not very difficult to create one. 
More on child themes will follow in Chapter 6, Customizing a WooCommerce Theme.

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 104 ]
Don't forget to activate the Child theme by clicking on the link after installation! 
Note that our theme requires us to install a couple of additional plugins. We receive 
a warning message that we can do this by clicking on the link, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
You would see the following screen after clicking on the link:
Select the plugins and install them all at the same time.

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
Whether or not your theme will ask for similar steps completely depends on the way 
it was set up by the developer. Refer to the documentation for your theme when 
you're in doubt about the steps to take. Note that after bulk-installing the plugins, we 
also need to activate them.
Premium themes are regularly delivered including demo content. If 
you are a beginner and find it difficult to start, it's often a good idea 
to install the demo content in your WordPress test environment. By 
combining the theme and demo content, is just gets easier to know 
the theme and its functions. Use the WordPress importer (Tools | 
Import in the menu) to import the demo content.
After installing the parent and child themes and activating it, our store page looks as 
follows on the frontend:
It's functional but still requires additional setup.

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 106 ]
Working with theme settings
WordPress is expanding the standard functions to work with theme settings since 
WordPress version 3.4. However, we can see that the possibilities have been too 
limited for premium themes and developers continued to work with their own 
solutions. This is changing though and WordPress puts in more and more effort on 
customizing your theme using the default WordPress customizer. In this example, 
the theme comes with its own solution. We can find the settings of our theme by 
navigating to Appearance | Theme options, but you might just as well find a new 
high-level menu item for your theme. The following screenshot shows the options 
for our theme:

Chapter 5
[ 107 ]
Our theme, The Retailer, offers an extended option panel with lots of options to set 
up our store and change the look and feel. Of course, we can upload our own logo, 
but it's also possible to change colors, fonts, the contents of the header and footer, 
and many more. There's no use in exploring all the possibilities here because they  
are theme-specific. Your situation will be different depending on the theme that 
you're using.
In the remaining part of this book, we'll switch back to the free Storefront theme. It 
gives us possibilities to show theme customization and development examples in a 
better way.
Do you like the way the theme, The Retailer, looks like and its flexibility 
to change all the colors just the way you need them? The theme is 
available for purchase at http://themeforest.net/item/the-
retailer-retina-responsive-woocommerce-theme/4287447.
Setting up your home page
There's one more item that we need to discuss that is generic and not really 
dependent on the theme you're using. Although it is a basic WordPress setting, 
we still see lots of users getting confused about it. When you have just installed 
WordPress, by default it will always show blog items on the Front page. For an 
online store that isn't suitable. You want to show products, maybe a slider and some 
other information. But in most cases not the blog. If you don't know how to change 
that  here' how:
1.	 First, navigate to Pages and create a new page named Homepage. Do not fill 
any content, just publish it. Note that sometimes, you'll have to set the page 
template to home page or front page, depending on your theme. Refer to 
your theme documentation if you're not sure.
2.	 Repeat this step and create a page named Blog.

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 108 ]
3.	 Head over to the WordPress Settings menu and click on Reading. In here, 
change the Front page displays to A static page and select the pages that 
you just created. The following screenshot shows an example. Save your 
settings and you're done. Depending on the way your theme works, it will 
automatically start filling your home page with a slider, products, or other 
items. Please refer to your theme documentation for more information.
Using the Storefront theme
The Storefront theme is definitely one of the better free themes. That makes sense 
because it was developed by the creators of WooCommerce. 
The functionality of Storefront is a bit limited. However, you can expand the 
functionality by installing additional plugins for Storefront, which you have to  
pay for. Let's first take a look at the changes that you can make by default.
After activating the theme, it will add additional menu items to the Appearance 
menu in WordPress. Here, you'll find several shortcuts for additional possibilities. 
WooThemes is a commercial company after all, so there are plenty of links here for 
more options, which you have to pay for.

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
Whether you click on the link to Configure menus or Open the Customizer, in 
both cases the WordPress customizer will be opened. Since WordPress 4.3, you 
can change your menus from within the customizer, but the old function using 
Appearance | Menus is still available:

Working with WooCommerce Themes
[ 110 ]
Just navigate the various options to change the items that you need, for example, the 
background and font colors.
Note that the Layout option on the left gives the possibility to show the sidebar on 
the left, which makes sense for a typical online store.
Adding a logo
It's possible to add a header image to the Storefront theme. But strangely enough, 
Storefront does not offer the possibility to add your company logo, and the header 
image isn't really meant for this. To solve this problem, you must download and 
install the Storefront Logo Plugin, which will add the function to the customizer, at 
https://wordpress.org/plugins/storefront-site-logo/. Alternatively, you 
may also use the WordPress Jetpack plugin, which also gives you the possibility to 
change the logo http://jetpack.me/.
Homepage control
Another plugin that you really want to install when working with the Storefront 
theme is Homepage control. Use it if you decide to use a regular page as a home 
page for your website instead of the blog. Download it at https://wordpress.org/
plugins/homepage-control/. Once activated, navigate to the customizer again to 
switch off any area that you do not want to include on your homepage:

Chapter 5
[ 111 ]
Did you notice that Storefront also shows an image for your product categories on 
the home page? You can switch these off, but if you want to keep them, navigate to 
Products | Categories and add an image for every category.
Let's have a look at our current result using the Storefront theme and without 
changing a single line of code!
You might want to make more changes to the theme, but changing code 
is something that we'll discuss in the next chapter. Before we dive into 
code, please also have a look at the Storefront customization plugin. 
It's not free, but gives you additional possibilities to change the look 
and feel of your store (http://www.woothemes.com/products/
storefront-woocommerce-customiser/).

Summary
There are lots of WooCommerce-compatible themes on the market. We've seen 
that working with a theme isn't difficult as long as you take the time to read the 
documentation and get to know your theme. The exact way of working may differ 
from theme to theme though, especially for premium themes.
The Storefront theme is giving us a good and solid base, and even without changing 
code, we can already reach a good-looking result.
In the next chapter, we'll have a closer look at the ability to modify the code of the 
Storefront theme.

Customizing a 
WooCommerce Theme
Working with standard themes is a quick and effective solution to get your store up 
and running, but soon you'll feel the need to make changes to the theme that you're 
using. Or leave the standard theme and create one from scratch yourself. In this 
book, I cannot offer you a complete development course. I'll discuss the basics that 
will give you a good start, working with the Storefront theme. In this chapter, we 
will cover:
•	
General directions for changing or creating a WordPress theme
•	
Tips for changing or creating a WooCommerce theme
•	
Some practical examples of changes in the Storefront theme
What we need to get started
First of all, before we do anything at all, you need to be aware of the fact that this 
chapter is not suitable for the real beginners. Did you ever work with HTML, CSS, 
and PHP and have some experience in these areas? Good, then you're good to move 
forward. If you do not yet have knowledge on these topics, it's probably better to 
skip this chapter and jump to Chapter 7, Running Your Online Store. That will be easier 
to follow.

[ 114 ]
If you're not yet familiar with the techniques mentioned, there's plenty of 
information available on the Internet to get you started. From short tutorials to 
complete online video training, everything is already there. The following websites 
are highly recommended:
•	
The Tuts+ network from Envato: For instance http://webdesign.
tutsplus.com/ and http://wp.tutsplus.com/. The Tuts+ network also 
offers additional tutorials and video training as a paid service.
•	
Smashing Magazine: at http://www.smashingmagazine.com/. Besides 
their web design tutorials and special WordPress corner available at http://
wp.smashingmagazine.com/, they also offer a recommended book series.
Would you rather work directly from a book? In that case, we can recommend the 
following books from Packt Publishing:
•	
Responsive Web Design by Example : Beginner's Guide: https://www.
packtpub.com/web-development/responsive-web-design-example
•

This chapter is too short to cover the topic of WordPress theme development 
completely. As we've seen, there have been complete books written about these 
topics. For this chapter, we'll stick to the basics and add specific WooCommerce 
information on top of that.
Before you start making changes to your theme, find out if it's really necessary to do 
so. WooCommerce comes with a lot of shortcodes that you can easily use on your 
posts and pages to call WooCommerce functions that you need. See http://docs.
woothemes.com/document/woocommerce-shortcodes/ for a full list and examples.

Tools every web designer needs
Every web designer or developer has his/her own favorite tools. That's fine; just use 
what you like. If you're just starting, the minimum that you need is as follows:
•	
An image editor. Photoshop is top-notch, but expensive. Photoshop elements 
would work as well, just as the free, open source Gimp.
•	
A plain text editor, being able to help you with your HTML, CSS, and PHP 
files. Windows users could look at the free Notepad++, Coda is a good tool 
for Mac users but has its price. Alternatively, have a look at Sublime Text, 
which has a free version.
•	
A set of browsers and devices to test your work. Do not underestimate this 
part, it could be very annoying and time-consuming to fix some issues that 
are related to a specific browser and version. Firefox users should look at the 
Firebug plugin as well, it really helps when making changes on a theme to be 
able to see them immediately. Chrome and Safari have such functions built-
in. The example below shows Google Chrome. Using the Inspect element 
function (just right-click on any element on your page), you are able to see 
which CSS styles were applied to that element. You may easily try to change 
the CSS code, but please note that these changes will not be stored and are 
only useful to test them. The following image below shows you the Inspect 
element function within Chrome:

WordPress theme basics
WordPress theme development in a short version:
•	
Every WordPress theme has its own folder, which you may find in the  
wp-content/themes folder of your WordPress installation.
•	
The bare minimum that every WordPress theme needs is an index.php and 
style.css file. The index.php file determines the way the home page looks 
like, by the so-called WordPress loop. There are also other possibilities for the 
home page, which we'll see in a minute. The style.css file contains all the 
styling or calls for other CSS files. It also contains the name and author of  
the theme.
•	
From index.php, lots of different PHP files can be called. Here are a couple 
of the most common ones, including their meaning:
°°
header.php: This contains the logic for the header of your theme, 
which mostly contains things such as the logo, website name, search 
bar, and menu. It also contains the necessary HTML head code.
°°
sidebar.php: This contains the definition of a sidebar, that is used to 
display widgets. More complex themes often give the possibility to 
use multiple sidebars with different content.
°°
footer.php: This contains some closing tags for the theme. Besides 
that, it has become quite common to define additional widget areas in 
the footer as well.
°°
home.php: This file can be used to show the latest blog posts on the 
landing page for your blog. Often, this is the home page of your 
website, but it doesn't have to be. If WordPress is set up to use a static 
page as the home page, then home.php could be used for your blog.
°°
front-page.php: If this file exists, it will be used for the home page 
of the website. If it doesn't exist, WordPress will look for home.
php. If both of them don't exist, index.php will be used. For a 
deeper explanation, have a look at http://codex.wordpress.org/
Creating_a_Static_Front_Page.

Chapter 6
[ 117 ]
°°
single.php: This is used to display a single post type—often, a 
single blog item.
°°
page.php: This is used to display a single WordPress page.
°°
functions.php: This is an important one because, here, you'll 
define all kinds of different functions for your theme, for instance, 
the widget positions, theme support for post thumbnails, and so 
on. Also, when creating WooCommerce themes, functions.php 
plays an important role. Using functions.php, you are able to add 
features and functions to your website. Note that for larger changes, 
creating a plugin is a better option though.
Are you making changes to an existing WordPress theme, please 
always work with a Child theme. The procedure to create one is very 
simple. I'll show you how to do this later on in this chapter.
There's much, much more, like the comments.php, search.php, 
author.php, and category.php. Note that you may use these kinds 
of different content types, but they aren't mandatory. If you want 
to learn all about these files, we highly recommend reading a book 
on WordPress Theme Development. Another great online resource 
is the WordPress codex: http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_
Development. It's also good to have a closer look at the template 
hierarchy, that describes exactly how all the files in a theme are 
working together: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/
basics/template-hierarchy.

Customizing a WooCommerce Theme

The image below shows a simplified structure of the way in which a WordPress 
theme is set up:

Chapter 6
[ 119 ]
Creating a Child theme
Before making any changes to your theme, it's always good to work with a child 
theme. A Child theme inherits all the functions from the parent theme that it belongs 
to. This has the following benefits:
•	
Everything you changed is easily visible. You won't keep on searching for 
that one little change that you made, but cannot remember where.
•	
When your theme receives an update, your changes are safe. The update 
is applied to the original theme and not to the changes that you made in 
your Child theme. Do not underestimate this, updates will be there, and 
only by creating a Child theme, you'll be sure that your changes will not be 
overwritten.
•	
It speeds up your web development. Even later on, if you'd decide to create 
your own theme, it's good to start with a solid base theme and work from there.
The steps that you need to create a child theme for the Storefront theme are as follows:
1.	 Navigate to the wp-content/themes folder. In there, every installed theme 
has its own folder.
2.	 Create a new folder named storefront-child. If you're creating a Child 
theme for a different theme, just replace storefront with your theme name. 
The result should look as follows:
3.	 In the new folder, create two empty text files named style.css and 
functions.php. Use text editor tools like the ones mentioned at the 
beginning of this chapter.

Customizing a WooCommerce Theme
[ 120 ]
4.	 Next, add the following code in the style.css file:
/*
 Theme Name:   Storefront Child
 Theme URI:    http://www.woothemes.com/storefront/
 Description:  Storefront Child Theme
 Author:       Robbert Ravensbergen
 Author URI:   http://www.joomblocks.com
 Template:     storefront
 Version:      1.0.0
 License:      GNU General Public License v2 or later
 License URI:  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 Tags:         black, white, light, two-columns, left-sidebar, 
right-sidebar, responsive-layout, custom-background
 Text Domain:  storefront-child
*/
Of course you should replace the various lines with your own data. 
Important are the lines  with the Template name, which is the name  
of the parent theme folder.
5.	 We also need to add a few lines of code to functions.php:
<?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
function theme_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() 
. '/style.css' );
}
6.	 It's important to know that if your parent theme loads more than just a single 
style.css, you need to include the additional CSS files separately, just like 
in your parent theme.

Chapter 6
[ 121 ]
7.	 Save both the files, and activate the new Child theme in the WordPress 
backend:
Note that the Child theme exists, but does not have an image yet. You may copy 
the existing image from the parent theme to your child theme folder ( named 
screenshot.png), or create your own.
Your Child theme is now fully up and running, and you can continue to make 
changes to it.
Note that the functions.php file of your Child theme will be loaded 
before functions.php of the parent theme. This gives possibilities 
to override functions in the parent theme, but only if they have been 
declared correctly in the parent theme. Do not duplicate function 
names from the parent theme in your child theme. That could cause 
fatal errors and your website could stop working completely.
Template files like for instance page.php, single.php, and others 
can be copied from the parent theme to the child theme. This will 
overwrite the original file, which gives the possibility to create your 
own version of these files.

Customizing a WooCommerce Theme
[ 122 ]
Often, you do not need to change the template files of your theme. Being able to 
change the CSS using a child theme is already a huge benefit. Let's finish with a 
simple example. In our Storefront theme, we would like to have a smaller header. 
The current header contains a lot of white space, which we want to decrease, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
To do that, we simply inspect the elements in the header using the Chrome tools that 
we saw earlier in this chapter.
We can see that margins have been defined for the site logo in the class site-logo-
anchor. There's also a margin at the top of the site header and navigation. Add the 
following lines of code to style.css of your Child theme:
.site-header {padding-top: 1.3em; }
.site-header .site-logo-anchor { margin-bottom: 0; }
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
   .main-navigation { padding-top: 0; }
   .woocommerce-active .site-header .site-header-cart { padding-top: 
0; }
}

Chapter 6
[ 123 ]
All that we do here is use smaller margins and paddings. The last two lines of code 
will only be applied on desktop screen resolutions (larger than 768 pixels in width). 
We leave the mobile view unchanged for now. Save the file and check the results. 
Notice that the header is much smaller now:
Developing WooCommerce themes
WooCommerce is delivered by default with a number of page templates that are 
used to display all shop information in the correct way. Even using the standard 
Twenty Fifteen theme, the WooCommerce pages already look pretty good. Just 
adding some additional CSS might be enough for you to get WooCommerce working 
even on a theme that was never even designed to work with WooCommerce. If you 
want to go further than that, here are the things that you need to know:
•	
As mentioned, do not change an existing theme directly; it's better to work 
with a Child theme. Using the method described previously, you can be 
sure that your changes will not be overwritten in case of an upgrade of the 
WooCommerce plugin.
•	
Find the default WooCommerce templates in wp-content/plugins/
woocommerce/templates.
•	
An overview of all the available WooCommerce template files can be 
found here as well http://docs.woothemes.com/document/template-
structure/.

Customizing a WooCommerce Theme
[ 124 ]
•	
Copy only the ones that you'd like to change to your child-theme in  
wp-content/themes/child-theme-name/woocommerce. Make sure to place 
your files here directly; do NOT use the templates subfolder that you can 
see in the original WooCommerce folder! If you are making changes to an 
existing WooCommerce theme, you'll already have this structure in place 
in your Parent theme. In that case, copy the files you want to change to the 
woocommerce folder within your Child theme.
•	
Keep the subfolders intact. For example, if originally the price.php is stored 
in wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/single-product, the 
location of your changed version of the file should be wp-content/themes/
child-theme-name/woocommerce/single-product.
•	
Besides the theme files, the woocommerce/templates folder also contains a 
subfolder holding e-mails. You may copy and change these in the same way 
to your Child theme to be able to adjust the content of the e-mail messages.
•	
Simply add/change HTML and PHP in the correct files, depending on your 
needs to influence the end result.
•	
A good presentation about the methods described above can be found at 
http://www.slideshare.net/corsonr/wordpress-montreal-meetup-
woocommerce-templates.
WooCommerce CSS
WooCommerce comes with default CSS styles to give the necessary elements at least 
some styling. These CSS files can be found in /wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/
assets/css. Also here, it's better not to change the existing files because your 
changes will be overwritten in case of an update of the plugin.
You may simply add some CSS styling to the stylesheet of your Child theme in order 
to change the colors, fonts, and so on. The stylesheet of your child theme should be 
made available here: wp-content/themes/my-child-theme/style.css.
For example, use the following code to change the color of the buttons:
a.button, button.button, input.button, #review_form #submit { 
background:green; }
If you want to completely disable the WooCommerce CSS styling, you can do this in 
the following way. Use your theme's functions.php file and add the following:
  add_filter( 'woocommerce_enqueue_styles', '__return_empty_array' );
But remember that as a beginner, it's easier to change existing styles than to create 
everything from scratch.

Chapter 6
[ 125 ]
WooCommerce hooks, actions and filters
WooCommerce heavily relies on the usage of Hooks, Actions, and Filters. It gives 
you the possibility to override the default output of WooCommerce. For instance, 
if you want to take control of the Checkout page and add or even remove fields in 
there, hooks and filters are what you need.
Let's first explain this concept. Within the WordPress and WooCommerce code, 
developers added hooks. On a hook, you can hang your own code so that it changes 
the original behavior. There are two types of hooks, which are actions and filters:
•	
An action allows you to add functionality to WooCommerce at a specific 
point in the process
•	
A filter allows you to intercept and change the data as it is being processed
In other words, using actions you can do something and using a filter you can 
change the data.
If the topic of using hooks and filters is still new to you, here you may find a good 
tutorial about it: http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-use-wordpress-hooks. 
Another good read explaining the concept for non-developers can be found at 
http://docs.presscustomizr.com/article/26-wordpress-actions-filters-
and-hooks-a-guide-for-non-developers.
Now, let's take the following example. In some countries, having the State field on 
the checkout page doesn't make sense because States are not actively used. In such a 
case, you might want to remove the field from the checkout page. Here's how to do 
just that.
Add the following code to your functions.php file in your Child theme:
// Hook in
add_filter( 'woocommerce_checkout_fields' , 'custom_override_checkout_
fields' );
// Our hooked in function - note that the $fields is passed via the 
filter
function custom_override_checkout_fields( $fields ) {
     unset($fields['shippping']['shipping_state']);
     unset($fields['billing']['billing_state']);
     return $fields;
}

Customizing a WooCommerce Theme
[ 126 ]
So what does this do? First of all, we add our own custom function to the 
WooCommerce Checkout fields filter. In our custom function, we simply remove 
two fields by using the unset function. However, please note that this is an example 
only. Removing the State field might break extensions that rely on it. Besides that, 
the preceding code does not check if the fields are set before removing them. So, be 
careful when applying changes like these and always make sure to keep a backup 
copies of the original files available.
There's more to discover regarding the development of your own WooCommerce 
theme; especially, when working with hooks and filters. Here are some additional 
resources to move forward:

Adding a logo using code
We saw earlier that adding a logo to the Storefront theme can be accomplished 
using an additional plugin. However, such a plugin might not be available for 
other themes. Besides that, adding more and more plugins is not a good idea for 
performance reasons. A simple change can just as well be made by a small code 
change. Let's see how we can add a logo to the Storefront theme without using the 
plugin. If you installed and used that plugin earlier, please remove it first:
/* Add a logo in the header */
add_action( 'init', 'storefront_logo' );
function storefront_logo() {
  remove_action( 'storefront_header', 'storefront_site_branding',  
    20 );
  add_action( 'storefront_header', 'storefront_display_logo', 20  
    );
}
function storefront_display_logo() {
?>
  <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>" class="site- 
    logo" rel="home">
    <img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri();  
      ?>/images/logo.png" alt="<?php echo get_bloginfo( 'name' );  
        ?>" />
  </a>
<?php
}

Chapter 6
[ 127 ]
We also need a small change to the CSS of our child theme because the class used is 
slightly different compared to the one used in the plugin:
.site-header .site-logo { float: left; margin-bottom: 0; }
Leave the remaining part of style.css unchanged. Note that the result of this small 
piece of code is the same as the one that the plugin offered.
Removing the sidebar
The Storefront theme offers you the possibility to show the sidebar on the right or on 
the left. But what if you would like to show the sidebar on the category pages, but 
completely remove it on the (single) product page?
This is also pretty simple to do. With only a few code changes, we'll have more space 
available for our product images. Add the following to functions.php of your 
Child theme:
add_action( 'get_header', 'remove_storefront_sidebar' );
function remove_storefront_sidebar() {
  if ( is_product() ) {
    remove_action( 'storefront_sidebar', 'storefront_get_sidebar',  
      10 );
  }
}

Customizing a WooCommerce Theme
[ 128 ]
Next, also add a line to style.css:
/* remove sidebar on product page */
body.woocommerce #primary { width: 100%; }
The end result is a much cleaner product page with larger product images:
Summary
In this chapter, we've seen the basics of a WordPress theme. Besides this, we've had 
a look at the specific functions that WooCommerce adds on the top of that and how 
you can take advantage of the template files included in WooCommerce.
In the next chapter, we'll focus on running our store and working with orders and 
customer data.

[ 129 ]
Running Your Online Store
During the former chapters, we've learned to work with WooCommerce themes. We 
even had a look at changing our WordPress theme, although this is a subject that 
requires a deeper knowledge of web design and coding techniques.
Once we set up our store, payment methods, products, and theme, we are able to 
start doing business! But what happens next? As a store owner, it's important to test 
the purchase process completely. Not only to check what your customers will see 
and receive, but also to know what will happen once your first orders start rolling in. 
In this chapter, we'll learn to:
•	
Adjust the notification e-mails
•	
Deploy our WooCommerce store
•	
Work with sales orders
•	
Manage the inventory
•	
Look at the available sales reports
Adjusting the notification e-mails
Assuming that, up to this point, you've been setting up your store in a development 
environment, you're now almost ready to deploy your store.
A topic that we didn't fully discuss during Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce, is 
e-mail messages. We discussed the basic settings, but what if we wanted to do 
additional changes? Let's first go back to the WooCommerce Settings page and  
click on the Emails tab.

Running Your Online Store
[ 130 ]
Under Email Options, there's a link available that shows a preview of your current 
e-mail template. We added a logo during Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce and 
changed some of the colors. Our example currently looks as follows:
Note that, besides the general e-mail settings, every e-mail that WooCommerce 
can send has its own form with settings. You may use this to disable the e-mail 
completely or change its subject and title.
WooCommerce seems to offer an invoice possibility because it shows a 
couple of settings for the invoice e-mail. However, real invoice numbering 
doesn't exist in WooCommerce. WooCommerce uses post ID's, which 
means in practice that gaps will appear in your order numbering. In lots 
of countries, it's mandatory to use a progressive invoice number. You'll 
need an additional plugin to solve this issue. An example will follow in 
Chapter 8, More Possibilities Using Plugins.
If you like to have complete control over your e-mail templates, you have the 
following two possibilities:
•	
Use an additional plugin that give the possibility to create the layout of the 
e-mail templates using drag and drop
•	
Change the code of the default WooCommerce e-mail templates

Chapter 7
[ 131 ]
In this chapter, we'll take a look at the second option. To be able to change the 
existing templates, you need to copy the template files to your own theme. By doing 
so, you will be able to change the HTML of your e-mails completely! Of course, you 
must have some PHP and HTML knowledge to be able to understand and change 
the files.
Don't just change the original WooCommerce e-mail templates in the plugin folder 
because, in that case, your changes will be lost when there's an update of the 
WooCommerce plugin.
If you want to use this possibility, copy the e-mail templates that you want to change 
from the following folder:
 wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/emails 
Copy this to your theme folder:
 wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/woocommerce/emails
In our demo store, using the Storefront Child theme, this would be as follows:
 wp-content/themes/storefront-child/woocommerce/emails
WooCommerce has a handy function available that copies the necessary file for you. 
You can find it at the bottom of every individual e-mail settings screen:
www.allitebooks.com

Running Your Online Store
[ 132 ]
When you copy the file to your theme, it will automatically be added to your child 
theme if you're using one. Next, the view template button shows the code of the 
template file. It's possible to make changes here immediately and save your changes. 
Working that way isn't recommended though, because a small mistake in the code 
might break your website:
If you made any mistakes that break your e-mail, it's always possible to restart. Use 
the button Delete template file to remove it from your theme, and you can copy the 
original file again.
Note that you only need to copy the files that you want to change. Don't just copy all 
of them if you don't need it. That would only become confusing in the future when 
doing updates.
In the WooCommerce plugin folder, you'll see a PHP file for every e-mail template. 
There's also a subfolder available named plain. In this folder, the templates for non-
HTML e-mails are stored. Depending on the changes that you're making, it can be 
necessary to copy as well the HTML e-mail templates as the plain versions to your 
theme folder.
Besides the template files, there are also helper files like email-header.php and 
email-footer.php. If you want to make a change to these parts of your e-mails, you 
need to copy these files as well.
For more information, refer to http://docs.woothemes.com/document/template-
structure.

Chapter 7
[ 133 ]
Deploying your WooCommerce store
Once you've set up your store, added products, and changed e-mails if needed, 
you're ready to start the deployment process of your store. Assuming that up 
until now, you've been working in a development environment, there's one more 
important thing that you need to do before bringing live your online store: test it!
Just use your store as if you are a customer. Is everything clear for the visitor? Are 
the links to conditions and shipping information easily available? Is it clear what 
payment methods you're offering? But above all, does the order process work? It's 
very important to spend some time in your own store and actually create orders 
yourself. So you are sure that it is working and that the e-mails that the customer 
receives are clear and correct.
If everything is okay, you can start the deployment process. There are many ways 
to deploy a website from development to live, but, in this example, we use a basic, 
simple technique to do it. Note the steps below only work if you're deploying a new 
website. If you are adding WooCommerce to an existing website, other steps could 
be needed.
1.	 Create a copy of the WordPress database. Actually, you should do this 
regularly for every website that you own or are developing. A tool like 
PhpMyAdmin may be used to create the backup. If you don't know how, also 
a database backup plugin can be used: https://wordpress.org/plugins/
wp-db-backup/.
2.	 If you're developing locally, you'll already have a complete file set of your 
WordPress installation available. If your temporary site is hosted with a 
hosting provider, you first need to create a full backup. Use an FTP tool like 
FileZilla to create one. Or you could even use a WordPress plugin to create a 
full backup.

Running Your Online Store
[ 134 ]
3.	 Next, restore the backup that you just created to the hosting environment 
at your hosting provider. Again, using FTP with FileZilla is an easy and 
straightforward method to do this:
4.	 Restore your database backup using the Import function of PhpMyAdmin, 
which is offered by almost every hosting provider.
5.	 Change the setting in your wp-config.php so that it holds the correct values 
for accessing the database at your hosting provider. If you make changes 
locally, be sure to upload the file using FTP again.
6.	 Basically, your store should be working now. However, settings and the 
contents of sidebars might be lost. This is caused by the way WordPress 
stores its data in the database. The complete URL, including the domain 
name, is stored. This is an issue because now that your store is live, the 
domain name has changed. To correct this situation, we need to do a find and 
replace in the database so that it will hold the correct domain name in all the 
records. There are several methods to do this, but I recommend using the tool 
of InterconnectIT: https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-
replace-for-wordpress-databases/. Download the tool and upload it to 
your hosting environment. Use it to do a search and replace from http://
localhost/… to http://yourdomain.com. Click the Dry run button to test 
the result, and use the Live run button to confirm and save the changes:

Chapter 7
[ 135 ]
After doing these database changes, your online store will be available on the new 
domain. Test if it is reachable on your domain, and also test if you can reach the 
WordPress administrative panel of your site. If something went wrong, your site 
won't be available. In that case, restore your database and start again.
If you need more information about moving your development 
website to a live environment, you may find a tutorial including 
more details on my website: http://www.joomblocks.com/
moving-a-wordpress-website.
Working with sales orders
Now, we will create a couple of sales orders using our own details just to test the 
process, whether our payment methods are working, and if the e-mails that we're 
sending are all working as expected.

Running Your Online Store
[ 136 ]
An order can be created as well from the frontend as from the WordPress 
administrative panel. Your customers will order from the frontend, of course.  
After creating an order, a typical confirmation page will look as follows. Besides  
the information shown on the screen, the customer and store owner will also receive 
an e-mail:
Once we create a couple of orders, we can find them in the WordPress administrative 
panel by navigating to WooCommerce | Orders. You will be notified of new orders 
directly in the menu. A small circle behind the Orders submenu shows the number 
of new orders:

Chapter 7
[ 137 ]
The Orders screen shows all the sales orders that you received, regardless of their 
order status. From here, you may continue to process your orders.
Note the following points when working from this screen:
•	
The status of the order is indicated by an icon. It's important to pay attention 
to this so that you won't ship any orders that have not been paid for. A green 
icon with the dots means that the order status is processing and you may 
ship the items. If the icon is orange, the status is pending payment. This 
happens when an online payment method was used, but the order has not 
been paid yet. An order with a grey icon is on hold and neither has been 
paid. It might be paid offline by a bank transfer or cheque. Do not ship the 
order yet. You need to manually check if you received the payment. An icon 
with a red cross means that the payment was canceled, failed, or was fully 
refunded; this order should not be delivered.
•	
You can change the status of the order by clicking on the icon at the right of 
the order line. For orders that have been cancelled, this isn't possible here. If 
you still need to change a cancelled order, you may do that by opening the 
order and edit it from the Edit order screen.
•	
By selecting multiple orders, it's possible to change the status of them all at 
the same time. Be careful because you could easily delete multiple orders 
using the bulk function at the top of the screen. Accidentally deleted orders 
will be moved to the trash and can be restored.

Running Your Online Store
[ 138 ]
•	
To the right of the shipping address, an icon will appear if the customer left 
any additional notes for its order:
•	
You can look at the order details by clicking on the order number or on the 
View icon at the right of the order line:

Chapter 7
[ 139 ]
The order detail screen shows a lot of information. You can find all the address 
information, details of the products ordered, including attributes, and detailed tax 
information. On the bottom right of this screen, you'll find a list of Order Notes, 
holding all the status changes and other information about the process that this 
order went through. It's possible to add manual notes yourself. There are two types 
of notes. Customer note will be sent to the customer by e-mail. Remember that these 
e-mails will only be sent if they are enabled. Navigate to WooCommerce | Settings 
| Emails | Customer note to verify that. It will be visible as well when the customer 
looks at the order details by logging in again. A private note is for you or your 
employees only. Your customer will not receive a private note by e-mail.
Further, on the top left of this screen, it's possible to change the Order status. You can 
set it to completed for instance once you have shipped all the items. Unfortunately, 
it's not possible to only ship a part of the order! After changing the status of an order, 
you must click on Save on the top right to make sure that the status change is actually 
saved. Depending on your e-mail settings, WooCommerce might send out a message 
to your customer to confirm that the order has been completed:

Running Your Online Store
[ 140 ]
Note that when setting an order to refunded by changing the status on the top right, 
there's no direct connection to your payment gateway. You'll have to manually 
make sure that your customer receives back the paid amount. Most payment service 
providers offer a function to refund an order amount. However, there's a function 
available that lets you automatically refund the amount online. To do this, use the 
Refund button below the order details. Whether or not you are able to refund the 
amount automatically depends on the payment gateway. Using PayPal, for instance, 
it is possible to do an automatic refund.
Handling refunds can be overwhelming sometimes, and there are 
lots of possibilities. If you want to learn more, there's a good article 
available in the WooCommerce documentation at https://docs.
woothemes.com/document/woocommerce-refunds/.

Chapter 7
[ 141 ]
By using Order Actions on the top right, it's possible to manually resend the order 
e-mails to your customer again. Also in this case, you need to press the Save Order 
button or the Apply icon on the right to actually send the message:
Note: the New order email will go to you as the shop 
administrator and not to the customer. The Processing order 
email will go to your customer.
At the bottom of this page, there's one more function available. When selling digital 
goods, like for example e-books, the buyer receives the order confirmation including 
a download link as soon as the status of the order becomes Processing. Sometimes, 
it's necessary to overrule the default behavior of WooCommerce and grant access to 
the file manually. You can do that, and it's even possible to grant access to a digital 
file that wasn't at all on the order. If you want to do that, just type the name of the 
product in the search box, select the correct product, and click on Grant Access:
After giving access, it's possible to limit the number of downloads for this file or set 
an expiration date. It's also possible to Revoke Access again.

Running Your Online Store
[ 142 ]
After creating several sales orders, you'll notice that the sales order 
numbering isn't always sequential:
Multiple order numbers are sometimes skipped. This is caused by the fact 
that WordPress saves everything as a post. A page is a post, a product 
is a post, and sales order is a post. They all use the same, single number 
sequence and that's why the sales order numbers will not be sequential. 
There's a plugin available that can solve this issue at https://
wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-sequential-order-
numbers/. This is the free version which is working fine but doesn't give 
you any options. The premium version is available on WooThemes.com.
Adding manual sales orders
Besides handling orders that were created by online customers, it's also possible to 
manually add a sales order yourself in the WordPress administrator. This is useful 
for orders that are for example placed by telephone, e-mail, or fax. Situations like this 
especially appear in business-to-business environments.
You may select the details of an existing customer by just start typing your 
customer's name in the Customer field. It's also possible to create the order for a 
Guest, so a customer that does not have an account in your store. This is the default 
setting. In this case, you have to enter the address details manually:

Chapter 7
[ 143 ]
If you want to use the data of an existing customer, start with typing the name in the 
Customer field. Otherwise, keep the default setting as Guest.
When adding the address data, the drop-down fields like Country and State can be 
filled easily. Just start typing in the field and the matching records will appear:

Running Your Online Store
[ 144 ]
Set Order Status and Payment Method based on the way the customer is going to 
pay for the order. When adding Shipping Details, it's possible to copy all the data 
from Billing Details so that you do not have to enter them again.
Click on the button Add line item(s) button, and then, click on Add product(s) to 
start adding products to your orders:
Next, a search window opens that lets you search and add a product to the order. 
You may change the quantity if needed.
From the window shown in the preceding screenshot, you may Add shipping cost 
to your order or add an order fee using the Add fee button. If you're adding the 
shipping cost, you manually have to select the correct shipping method and amount 
it will not be filled in automatically.
Click on the Save button on the bottom left once you're finished with adding items. 
Click on Calculate totals as well to set the total order value.

Chapter 7
[ 145 ]
Don't forget to also click on Save on the top right corner to save your order. Once 
saved, you can manage this order in exactly the same way as a sales order entered by 
an online customer.
The WooThemes website is a great and updated resource. If you 
have additional questions about managing your orders, then this 
is a good starting point: https://docs.woothemes.com/
document/managing-orders/.
Reporting
By navigating in the main menu to WooCommerce | Reports we'll be able to take 
a look at the reporting capabilities that WooCommerce has available. It delivers 
a number of standardized reports that already give a lot of information. But 
unfortunately, there isn't much flexibility in this area. Just use what is available or 
find alternative reporting methods. More on reporting possibilities will follow in the 
next chapter.
When opening the reporting page, we'll see four main areas that are divided by tabs:
•	
Orders
•	
Customers
•	
Stock
•	
Taxes
Sales reports
Every main area contains several reports. By default, the reporting section always 
opens with the Sales by date report of the last seven days. The following reports of 
sales orders are available:
•	
Sales by date (default)
•	
Sales by product
•	
Sales by category

Running Your Online Store
[ 146 ]
•	
Coupons by date
For every Sales report, it is possible to select the date range. By default, this is the Last 
7 days, but other possibilities are This Month, Last Month, and the current Year. 
Besides that it's possible to enter a custom date range. Click on the Go button after 
entering the start and end date. WooCommerce automatically selects a matching 
period so that the graph can be drawn. For instance, when selecting a period of a year 
or more, WooCommerce will show the revenue per month in the graph.
On the top right of the screen, there's a button named Export CSV. If you click it, 
a file will be created holding the data of your graph so that you can import it to, 
say, for example Excel. Note that this is already aggregated data per period and no 
individual sales orders will be exported here.
Customer reports
In the Customers report section, two reports are available:
•	
Customers versus guests
•	
Customer list

Chapter 7
[ 147 ]
The customers versus guests reports give the ratio of buyers that did and did not 
create an account in your store. The second report, customer list, is more interesting 
because it shows your top buyers. Unfortunately, customers that do not have an 
account in your store will not be shown on this list.
Stock reports
There are three different stock reports available:
•	
Low in stock
•	
Out of stock
•	
Most Stocked
All three reports are generally the same; the only difference is the filter that 
determines which items will be shown:
The example above shows the Most Stocked report, which sorts all the products 
with the available stock. The highest stock level shows on top of the report. You may 
navigate to the product details in as well the frontend as backend by using the icons 
on the right.

Running Your Online Store
[ 148 ]
Stores working with lots of products will have an issue with the limitations of these 
reports. It isn't possible to export the data or search within the report.
Tax reports
The Taxes area contains the following reports:
•	
Taxes by code
•	
Taxes by date
It shows the sales tax that has been calculated for your orders. For both reports, you 
can set the date range. The Taxes by code report splits the sales tax per code, which 
is handy if you're working with different tax rates for your products. The Taxes by 
date report shows the tax totals per month, regardless of the used tax codes.
Summary
In this chapter, we've learned how to adjust the notification e-mails that are 
generated by WooCommerce. Next, we deployed our store from a development 
environment to live.
We also had a closer look at the possibilities to manage your orders. Finally, we 
worked with the reporting possibilities that are available within WooCommerce.
In the next and final chapter, we'll expand the functionality of our online store using 
additional plugins. We have covered the basics now, but using plugins there's much 
more that WooCommerce has to offer.

[ 149 ]
More Possibilities  
Using Plugins
As you know, WooCommerce is a plugin for WordPress. Even though it might sound 
strange, it's possible to expand the functionality of WooCommerce with additional 
plugins. Those are regular WordPress plugins as well, just like any other. The only 
difference is that these plugins will only work if WooCommerce has been installed.
In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics:
•	
Where to find the right WooCommerce plugins
•	
Popular and useful plugins. We'll have a closer look at:
°°
WooCommerce and Google Analytics integration
°°
WooCommerce and the Yoast SEO plugin
°°
Plugins for advanced products
°°
Plugins for online marketing
°°
Plugins for easier store management
°°
A store in multiple languages
°°
Free plugins

[ 150 ]
Where to find the right WooCommerce 
plugins
We already noticed earlier in this book that we probably need additional plugins to 
support the Payment Method or Payment Service Provider of our choice. There are a 
number of websites that we can check to see if the functionality we need is available:
•	
WooThemes: http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/
woocommerce-extensions/. The extensions offered here are not 
always developed by the WooCommerce core team, but by third-party 
programmers. The plugins found here are of a good quality, but sometimes 
can be pricey. However, note that programmers will have to make some 
money as well. By charging an amount for their plugins, they will be able to 
keep supporting them, which is important if your online business is going to 
rely on it. The commercial WooThemes plugins include one year of support.
•	
WordPress: http://www.wordpress.org/extend/plugins. The plugins 
offered here are free, or have at least a free (limited) version available. We 
found extensions to support Payment Service Providers and for easier shop 
management. We'll discuss a few of the free plugins later on in this chapter.
•	
A valuable resource for commercial, but affordable plugins is CodeCanyon: 
http://codecanyon.net/category/wordpress/ecommerce/WooCommerce. 
In here, you may currently find over 700 (!) extensions for WooCommerce. 
But pay attention: not all of them will be up to date and ready for 2.4, the 
newest version of WooCommerce. Just as on ThemeForest, CodeCanyon is a 
marketplace offering extensions from lots of different developers. Carefully 
check the given ratings and comments by other users . Not every plugin is 
supported by the developers. If the support is poor, it's very likely that you 
can find comments on the support and code quality in the comment section:

Chapter 8
[ 151 ]
•	
Other smaller vendors worth checking out are as follows:
°°
IgniteWoo (http://ignitewoo.com) is a smaller company which 
offers themes and plugins.
°°
SkyVerge (https://www.skyverge.com) is offering a versatile 
collection of WooCommerce plugins and also offers some free 
plugins. The premium plugins of Skyverge are sold on the 
WooThemes website.
Besides these resources, there will be other developers offering their products and 
services. Not all plugins are mentioned on the websites mentioned above. If you 
cannot find what you're looking for, give Google a try as well. There are developers 
delivering WooCommerce plugins directly from their own website. If you're looking 
for an extension to support your Payment Service Provider or Carrier, don't forget  
to ask them if they have one available! Sometimes, you might even get it for free in 
this way.

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 152 ]
Whatever plugin you choose to use, there are a couple of best practices that you need 
to pay attention to when working with plugins:
•	
Try to minimize the number of plugins that you're using. Too many plugins 
can be bad for performance if they are not well-coded. Having too many 
plugins also makes it difficult to technically manage your shop in the future.
•	
Have a look at the latest update date. This is especially important for free 
plugins and plugins offered on a marketplace like CodeCanyon. Is the plugin  
brand-new, then it might not be the best solution to use in a production 
environment. If the plugin is not being actively maintained anymore, then 
try to look for a better alternative. Even if the plugin is still working at this 
moment, problems will arise in the future when new versions of WordPress 
and WooCommerce are being released.
•	
Check the reviews of other users, if available.
•	
Always make sure that you have a full backup of your website available 
before you start to add or remove plugins. The backup must include a copy 
of the WordPress database.
A closer look at plugin prices
When looking closer at the plugin prices, you may notice that some plugins require  
a yearly renewal, whereas others deliver free updates forever. Vendors change  
their pricing model sometimes, but, at this moment, you have to take the following 
into account:
•	
At WooThemes, you buy the plugin at the full price. After a year, you may 
renew your license at 50% of the current sales price. If you do not renew, you 
will no longer be able to download the updates.
•	
At CodeCanyon, you receive free updates as long as the plugin is being 
maintained by the developers. Six months of support is included in the 
purchase price. If you need to extend support, you must pay an additional 
fee. Be aware that to be able to just download the latest version, it isn't 
necessary to extend the support period.
All other vendors have varying pricing models and their own way of handling 
support and updates. Always take a close look at the conditions so that you know 
what you are going to pay in the future. Keeping your store up to date is important, 
so please do not stop paying for your extensions just to save some money.
Note that all the prices mentioned in the remaining part of this chapter were the 
actual prices at the moment of writing. The prices of the mentioned extensions are 
subject to change.

Popular and useful WooCommerce 
plugins
Now that we've seen where to go for WooCommerce extensions, which ones  
will be useful to our store? Although WooCommerce already offers all the basic 
functions for an online store, there's always something that we can improve or  
need to do differently.
WooCommerce and Google Analytics 
integration
Once your store is up and running, it's important to start working on improvements. 
To be able to do that you first need to collect data about your visitors. Google 
Analytics is the free and most widely used tool to do so. If you've ever run any 
website before, you're probably familiar with it.
Unfortunately, even if you have already connected your website to Google Analytics, 
it will not track e-commerce conversions. Since that is important to have available, 
we need to take additional steps to solve this issue.
By searching the WordPress.org plugin repository, some plugins are available, but 
none of these have been actively maintained at the moment of writing.
Therefore, a good combination is the Google Analytics plugin of Yoast (free) 
combined with the WooCommerce add-on ($49) from https://yoast.com/
wordpress/plugins/ga-ecommerce/.
When working with commercial plugins, you'll often find that 
the plugin cannot be installed by searching the WordPress.org 
repository from the WordPress administrative panel. On a website 
like WooThemes.com or CodeCanyon.com, you buy your product 
and receive a ZIP archive in most cases. Such an archive file 
contains everything that you need, but you first need to extract 
(unzip) it before being able to use the plugin. The archive often 
contains the plugin along with documentation and sometimes, 
other resources. If you don't extract the files, uploading the 
complete ZIP archive to your WordPress installation will simply 
fail. If you need more detailed instructions, you can find them 
on my blog at http://www.joomblocks.com/how-to-
install-a-commercial-wordpress-plugin.

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 154 ]
WooCommerce and the Yoast SEO plugin
During the last couple of years, the Yoast SEO plugin has, more or less, become the 
standard SEO plugin available. It's the expertise of the Yoast team on the SEO subject 
combined with a very user-friendly plugin that makes the plugin so popular. The 
free version gives more than enough options to start. Use them like you're used to for 
regular pages and posts.
Below you'll see an example of using the basic fields of the Yoast SEO plugin:
Yoast also offers a paid extension for WooCommerce, which gives some additional 
possibilities to influence the Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest integration. It also 
gives you control over the WooCommerce default breadcrumbs and improves the 
quality of your sitemap. More information can be found at https://yoast.com/
wordpress/plugins/yoast-woocommerce-seo/.

Chapter 8
[ 155 ]
The following screenshot show the additional settings the paid SEO for 
WooCommerce extension is offering:
Note that to be able to use Schema & OpenGraph additions, you first need to 
create attributes for your products. After creating attributes for Brand and/or 
Manufacturer, you'll be able to use them in the WooCommerce SEO plugin as  
shown in the screenshot above. Refer to Chapter 3, Using Downloadable Products  
and Variations, for more information about working with attributes.
Advanced products
WooCommerce already provides you with some pretty good possibilities to create 
different types of products, but sometimes, this isn't enough. If you need more 
options, have a look at the following plugins.

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 156 ]
WooCommerce product add-ons are available from WooThemes for a current price 
of $49. It gives you the possibility to add custom fields to your product, for example, 
when you need your customer to add a text to customize a product:
Alternatively, the CodeCanyon plugin, WooCommerce custom fields & Product 
add-ons, has a similar functionality. On top of that, using this plugin it's also possible 
to gather additional information from your customer during checkout. The plugin 
is available here: http://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-custom-fields-
product-addons/11332742.
Another possibility to change fields on the checkout page, if available through 
WooThemes: http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-checkout-
field-editor/.
Online marketing
Next, we're going to have a look at some plugins that will help you doing online 
marketing for your store in various ways.

Chapter 8
[ 157 ]
The MailChimp integration
E-mail marketing is, or should, play an important role in your online business. There 
are lots of solutions out there, but MailChimp (http://mailchimp.com) is a very 
popular choice because of the free plan up to 2000 subscribers. Using the MailChimp 
integration plugin, your customers will be able to sign up to your e-mail list when 
they go through the checkout. Besides this, the plugin also offers a nice widget for 
your WordPress dashboard that shows the subscriber statistics. Since it is offered 
on the WooThemes website, we may assume that it will still work with the latest 
version of WooCommerce. You may find the plugin here: http://www.Woothemes.
com/products/newsletter-subscription/. The plugin is also able to use the 
Ecommerce360 functionality of Mailchimp that gives you the possibility to track 
visitors and customers coming from your e-mail campaigns individually. Currently, 
the price for this extension is $49. It can also be used to connect WooCommerce to the 
e-mail marketing provider Campaign Monitor (https://www.campaignmonitor.
com/), instead of Mailchimp. Both e-mail providers have plenty of functions 
available. Mailchimp has a pretty good free plan, which makes it easy and accessible 
for starting sellers.
There's also a cheaper alternative available at CodeCanyon for $19: http://
codecanyon.net/item/mailchimp-for-wordpress/11479536, which even 
includes a visual form designer.
Are you working with a different e-mail marketing solution for your newsletters? 
There's a good chance that there are integration plugins available. Just check the 
various extension websites and ask your e-mail provider, if needed.
Social coupons
Having the standard social like and share buttons in your store is something that 
we cannot do without. We could use the default share buttons you see everywhere, 
but there are better alternatives available. One of them is the Social coupon for 
WordPress plugin available on CodeCanyon at http://codecanyon.net/item/
social-coupon-for-wordpress/3417466.

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 158 ]
What makes this extension so interesting is that our visitors can share the product 
page on social media networks to obtain a discount coupon code that they can 
immediately use. This could be the ideal last step to convince visitors to buy. If 
products get shared a lot, this will automatically drive new traffic to your store! 
Below you'll find a screenshot of this plugin working on our demo store:
Google shopping
Advertising is going to be important as your store has just gone live and no one will 
be able to find you through the search engines yet. We recommend having a closer 
look at this area and learn to use the various possibilities. Besides the well-known 
regular Google AdWords ads, you could consider using Google shopping as well. 
More information can be found in Google Merchant Center at http://www.google.
com/merchants.
You'll need a plugin for WooCommerce to be able to connect the products in 
your store automatically to Google. You may buy this plugin here: http://www.
woothemes.com/products/google-product-feed/. It's currently priced at $79 for 
a single website. There are also other alternatives out there, but for those you need to 
pay. Free plugins to export your products to the Google Merchant Center are often 
not maintained.

Chapter 8
[ 159 ]
Alternatively, if you do not have a lot of different products, it's also possible to just 
fill in a Google spreadsheet with your data and upload that one.
On the other side of the spectrum, we see services like the ones offered by  
http://www.exportfeed.com/. This isn't cheap, but they offer a full service 
including the possibility to export your products automatically to marketplaces  
like for instance Amazon and eBay. If you have lots of products and want to be  
able to sell them everywhere, this is probably a good solution.
Abandoned carts
Lots of visitors on your website will have the intention to buy something from you 
but, in the end, they don't. Something else came in between and they got distracted. 
End of story, and you lost your sale. Fortunately, there's something that you can do 
to help minimize this. There are plugins available that send your customer an e-mail 
at a specific time after they have abandoned their cart. You could even include a 
discount coupon in the reminder message.

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 160 ]
There are several plugins on the market that help retrieve abandoned carts. Plugins 
like these will only work if the customer left their e-mail address, for example by 
creating an account. To name few possibilities https://www.tychesoftwares.com/
store/premium-plugins/woocommerce-abandoned-cart-pro/. With a price of 
€119, this is a pretty expensive plugin. Luckily, there's also a light version which is 
available for free at the WordPress.org website (https://wordpress.org/plugins/
woocommerce-abandoned-cart/) that gives you the possibility to check the plugin 
and decide later on if chasing abandoned carts is something that is really going to 
increase the revenue of your business.
Plugins for store management
There are lots of additional plugins available to expand the functions that are 
available in order to run your store. From shipping calculations to invoicing  
and reporting, there are extensions available in every area.
Table rate shipping
We mentioned earlier in this book that the possibilities to calculate the shipping costs 
in WooCommerce are not always enough to suit your needs. Sometimes, you need 
to be able to store tables with shipping amounts based on volume or weight of the 
individual products or the total cart. This is where the Table rate shipping extensions 
will be helpful. There are multiple plugins available on the market. Let's start with 
the table rate shipping extension offered on the WooThemes website: http://www.
woothemes.com/products/table-rate-shipping/.

Chapter 8
[ 161 ]
The screenshot below shows you the table rate shipping plugin. In this example,  
the shipping fee that the customer pays is based on the country and total weight  
of the order:
This is a pretty expensive extension with a price of $199 for a single website. 
The extension is flexible and easy to use, but maybe other alternatives can work 
just as well. The table rate shipping extension offered at CodeCanyon offers 
similar functions on a bargain rate of only $22: http://codecanyon.net/item/
woocommerce-table-rate-shipping/3796656. However, note that setting up 
table rate shipping can become complex. The support offered by WooThemes might 
therefore be one of the reasons to still choose that plugin.
Note: why would you bother with using an extension from 
WooThemes.com if plugins found elsewhere are much cheaper? 
The reason is simple: if you're starting an online business, then you 
are creating something for a longer period. Extensions bought on 
the WooThemes store probably will be updated for a longer period. 
We say probably because, even on WooThemes.com, we won't be 
sure that extensions will always be updated and continue to be 
supported. Based on our experience, we expect that your chances 
are better when using the official WooCommerce extensions, 
but there are no guarantees. And we've also seen examples of 
extensions on CodeCanyon that are already available for a couple of 
years and keep on getting updated. It's up to you to decide.

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 162 ]
Invoicing
WooCommerce is offering the possibility to generate invoices for your store, but 
these won't be valid for all countries. Of course, we have the e-mails that will be sent 
out, but these are order confirmations only. The PDF Invoices extension available 
on the WooThemes website does just what we need. It's able to create a PDF invoice 
and use sequential invoice numbers. The invoice file is automatically attached to the 
e-mail that will be sent when the order is marked as completed.
The plugin is available here: http://www.woothemes.com/products/pdf-
invoices/.
The other vendors that we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter are offering 
invoicing plugins as well. Just check which one fits your needs.
Subscriptions
A function that is often asked for is being able to use subscriptions. Let's say that we 
would offer access to a closed area of our website with very valuable content. We'd 
like our customers to buy a subscription in this case and charge them every month. 
By default, that's not possible in WooCommerce. With the subscription extension, 
we can do so. This plugin can also be bought at the WooThemes website for $199 
(http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).
To be able to charge customers every month, our payment gateway needs to support 
such transactions. This isn't always the case. PayPal is supported out of the box by 
the plugin. For other payment gateways, have a look at this overview: http://docs.
woothemes.com/document/payment-gateways/.
Note: More detailed instructions on creating a subscription-based 
website with WooCommerce can be found in Packt Publishing's 
book, WooCommerce Cookbook by Patrick Rauland (https://www.
packtpub.com/web-development/woocommerce-cookbook).
Reporting
In Chapter 7, Running Your Online Store, we noticed that the reporting and 
management possibilities of WooCommerce can sometimes be a bit limited.  
And even looking at the available extensions, the choice is still very limited.

Chapter 8
[ 163 ]
The Cart reports extension available on the WooThemes website extends the 
standard functions with a few additional reports. It delivers interesting information 
about the number of carts that were abandoned and products that were abandoned 
while in the cart. If the cart was created by a logged-in user, we can even send them 
an e-mail about it. The extension is available here: http://www.woothemes.com/
products/woocommerce-cart-reports/.
Another extension that can get integrated into the reporting function of 
WooCommerce is the Cost of goods plugin. It gives you the possibility to check 
your margins by date or product. The extension is available here: http://www.
woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-cost-of-goods/.
Finally, we would also like to mention the following reporting plugin: http://woo.
report/. At the moment of writing, this extension could be downloaded for free, 
but it seems that in the near future, a fee will be charged. This extension delivers 
some really good insights on customer behavior, sales per product, and value of your 
stock. These things are missing in WooCommerce itself.
Business to Business catalog
WooCommerce can easily be used as an online catalog, but prices will always remain 
visible. If you want to hide your prices and only show them to authenticated users, 
this plugin is the one that you need: http://www.woothemes.com/products/
catalog-visibility-options/.

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 164 ]
This plugin also offers the possibility to hide the e-commerce functionality 
completely so that your store will only be an online catalog:
Importing product data
If we would already have a product catalog available, WooCommerce is not giving 
us the possibility to automatically import product data. The Product CSV Import 
Suite available at WooThemes can be a real time-saver: http://www.woothemes.
com/products/product-csv-import-suite/.
If you are moving from another WooCommerce store, you can just export product data 
from the first site and import them to the new website using the WordPress importer 
plugin. In other situations where you have to import your products from another 
software solution, it's better to use a plugin like the one mentioned previously.
At the moment of writing this, this plugin is priced at $199. You can easily create a 
CSV file using Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. If you're currently using a different 
solution to store your product data, then often there's a possibility to export this data 
using the CSV file format. The plugin offers enough flexibility to map your product 
fields to the fields available in WooCommerce.
Alternatively, take a look at the WP All Import plugin at http://www.wpallimport.
com/.
USA tax calculations
We've seen during Chapter 1, Setting Up WooCommerce, that the standard available tax 
calculations are not always flexible enough when you're doing business in the USA.

Chapter 8
[ 165 ]
The TaxNow plugin, using the Avalara service, can overcome this problem, but it is 
a paid service. More information about TaxNow can be found here: http://www.
avalara.com/products/avatax. The WooCommerce plugin can be bought here for 
$49: http://www.adipietro.com/product/taxnow-for-WooCommerce/.
A store in multiple languages
If you need to run a website in multiple languages, there's one major player in 
the market that you need to go to: WPML (https://wpml.org/). Unfortunately, 
WordPress does not support multilingual websites out of the box, so using plugins 
is always mandatory. Creating a store in multiple languages is a pretty complex 
process and requires you to thoroughly read the documentation provided by 
WPML. You'll need the Multilingual CMS plugin that is currently available from $79. 
Running WPML can become resource-intensive, so keep in mind that it can have 
consequences for your hosting plan as well:

More Possibilities Using Plugins
[ 166 ]
You'll need to install several plugins offered by WPML:
•	
WPML Multilingual CMS
•	
WPML Translation Management
•	
WPML Media
•	
WPML CMS Nav
•	
WMPL String translation
•	
WooCommerce Multilingual
The WPML plugin offers a pretty good guide for beginners at https://wpml.
org/documentation/getting-started-guide/. Besides that, please also read 
the documentation the was made for WooCommerce users: https://wpml.org/
documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/.
All the plugins are included when buying the WPML package.
Free plugins
We've seen in this chapter that the majority of WooCommerce plugins are offered by 
commercial parties. Sometimes, there's a free, limited version of the plugin available. 
Now, there's nothing wrong with this because if your online business relies on it, it's 
better to have a developer that is actually maintaining the plugin code. This doesn't 
mean that with a free plugin the code won't be maintained, but we've seen lots of 
situations in the past where free plugins were not regularly updated. However, 
if you're looking for free plugins, here are a couple of examples that are worth 
checking out:
•	
The WooCommerce customizer (https://wordpress.org/plugins/
woocommerce-customizer/) offers a couple of combined functions which are 
simple but actually missing in the WooCommerce core. You can, for instance, 
set the number of products shown on the product page and change some of 
the default texts used within the checkout process.
•	
WooCommerce does not use sequential order numbers. This is caused 
by the fact that the numbering is shared with other post types like pages, 
posts, products, and so on. The result of this is an order number sequence 
that doesn't make sense at all. This free plugin solves this issue: https://
wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-sequential-order-numbers/. 
However, test it in your situation first; I've seen examples where the plugin 
didn't play together nicely with the payment plugins.

Chapter 8
[ 167 ]
•	
WooCommerce doesn't offer wishlist functionality out of the box. The plugin 
YITH WooCommerce Wishlist (https://wordpress.org/plugins/yith-
woocommerce-wishlist/) solves this in a nice way and is regularly updated. 
There's also a pro version available that is offering more options.
Of course, the plugins mentioned above just were examples to show you what 
WooCommerce is capable of doing. There are many, many more possibilities, so 
always carefully check if your requirements can be met using an existing extension. 
If the functionality that you need is not available, it sometimes makes sense to have it 
created just for your situation. In such a case, always ask for programmers that have 
experience with creating custom WooCommerce plugins!
Summary
The functionality of WooCommerce can be easily expanded using plugins. Unless 
you have a unique requirement, almost everything is already available. Most of the 
plugins aren't free, but remember that developers will have to be able to deliver 
continuous support on their products. Although it is tempting to install lots of 
plugins, we recommend installing only what you really need. The more plugins 
that you have, the larger the chance of conflicts or problems during WordPress or 
WooCommerce upgrades.
By now, you should have a good solid knowledge of the possibilities of 
WooCommerce and the way in which the solution works. Of course, there's more 
to discover than the topics discussed in this book. The WooThemes website is being 
updated continuously and is always a good resource for more information. Besides 
that, continuing with the WooCommerce Cookbook is a good next step as well 
(https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/woocommerce-cookbook). It 
contains lots of practical WooCommerce recipes for users and developers.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book, Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management, in April 2004, and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using 
to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have 
seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, 
giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern yet unique publishing company that focuses on producing quality,  
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike.  
For more information, please visit our website at www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order  
to continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Open Source brand,  
home to books published on software built around open source licenses, and offering 
information to anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open 
Source brand also runs Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty 
to each open source project about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals should 
be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you would 
like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, then please contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
