CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. What Behavior Deserves Criminal Punishment (LO1)  
 
A. Not all wrongs are crimes. 
 
B. Behavior that deserves punishment warrants criminal liability.  
C. Criminal liability is reserved for conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably 
inflicts or threatens harm.  
 
 
II. Crimes and Noncriminal Wrongs (LO1)  
A. Criminal law is one form of social control, but there are others.  Criminal 
liability is the most extreme response to wrongdoing. 
B. Torts are similar to crimes in that they are a set of rules which apply to 
everyone in the community, and the power of the law backs them up 
C. Torts are also similar in that they often have the same names, and, almost 
every crime is also a tort. 
D. Torts are dissimilar to crimes in that they are brought by nongovernmental 
parties called plaintiffs who can only get money damages 
E.  Unlike crimes, there is no conviction or public condemnation if the party is 
found responsible for the wrongdoing.   
F.  Conviction is the expression of the community’s hatred or contempt for the    
convict.  Criminal punishment expresses societal censure of the offender. 
G. Sentencing, after the conviction of a crime, is a discretionary judicial function. 
 
III. Classifying Crimes (LO1) 
 
A. There are many ways to classify crimes, most of them with ancient roots. 
 
B. Mala in se (inherently evil) crimes and mala prohibita offenses 
1. Mala in se crimes involve behavior that is inherently wrong or evil. 
2. Mala prohibita offenses involve behavior that is only criminal because 
there is a law prohibiting it. 
3. Examples of mala in se crimes — murder and rape 
4. Examples of mala prohibita offenses — parking violations 
 
C. Felony and Misdemeanor—Classifications based on punishment 
 
 
1. Felonies—defined 
 
 
2. Misdemeanors—defined 
 
 
3. Distinction matters. 
 
 
 
a. Procedures for felonies are different. 
 
 
 
b. Prior felony convictions may enhance sentence. 
c. Legal consequences of felonies (for example, voting rights) that 
are not there for misdemeanors 
 
 
IV. The General and Special Parts of Criminal Law (LO2) 
 
A. The General Part 
 
 
1. Broad propositions that apply to nearly every crime 
2. Crimes of general applicability, such as attempt, conspiracy, solicitation 
 
 
3. Principles of complicity 
 
 
4. Principles of justifications and excuses

B. The Special Part (LO2) 
1. Defines specific crimes; spells out the elements of the crime which 
prosecutors have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to convict 
defendants. 
 
 
 
a. Crimes against persons 
 
 
 
b. Crimes against property 
 
 
 
c. Crimes against public order and morals 
 
 
 
d. Crimes against the state 
 
V. The Sources of Criminal Law (LO3) 
A. In addition to legislative and judicial lawmaking, there are several sources of 
criminal law. Most current criminal law is created by state legislatures or local 
governing bodies. Federal Congress and administrative agencies are also 
responsible for much of the current criminal law. 
B. Common-Law Crimes—Law that emerged over a long period of time and was 
based on customs and traditions passed down and were incorporated into court 
decisions. 
1. State common-law crimes: Many states have common law in their 
history, but most have now abolished it to some extent.  
2. Federal common-law crimes: There are no official federal common-law 
crimes; however, as judges interpret congressional acts and engage in 
judicial lawmaking, they are creating federal common law. 
C. State Criminal Codes—Periodically, states have been urged to abolish 
common-law crimes and establish a criminal law based solely upon criminal 
codes (called the codification movement).  The first criminal codes appeared 
in 1648 by the New England Puritans. 
D. The Model Penal Code (MPC)—After several decades, the American Law 
Institute created a draft code in 1962 that abolished common-law crimes. Even 
states that have not strictly abolished their codes have been influenced by the 
MPC. 
1. MPC not adopted in total by any state, but followed by most of the 
states 
 
 
2. Structure of the MPC has “general part” and “special part” 
3. MPC defines criminal liability and answers which behavior deserves  
criminal punishment 
E. Municipal Ordinances—Municipalities have broad but not unlimited power to 
create local crime laws and determine the punishment for those crimes. Some 
of the limitations on this power include constitutional limitations, the state’s 
having a conflicting law, and the inability to create felonies or crimes for 
which the punishment is more than one year of jail time. 
F. Administrative Agency Crimes—State and federal agencies also make 
administrative rules that have criminal penalties. Administrative agencies base 
their authority to make administrative crime on rule-making authority that is 
delegated to them by Congress or state legislatures.

VI. Criminal Law in a Federal System (LO3) 
A. There are fifty-two criminal codes in America—one for each state, the District 
of Columbia, and the U.S. Criminal Code for the federal government. 
B. These codes resemble one another but they differ significantly in both the 
definitions of crimes and the severity of punishment. 
C. Punishments also differ widely among the states. 
 
VII. What is the Appropriate Punishment for Criminal Behavior? (LO4) 
A. The United States uses incarceration extensively as a punishment for criminal      
behavior.  In addition, millions of Americans are on probation, parole, and 
other forms of community corrections. 
B. Punishment takes many forms, but each must meet the four criteria (inflict 
pain, be prescribed by the law that defines the crime, be intentionally 
administered, and be administered by the state). 
 
C. Distinguish between punishment and treatment—not always clear 
D. There are two schools of thought concerning the purpose of punishment: 
retribution and treatment. 
 
  
1. Retribution—punishing individuals for their past crimes 
a. Retributionists assume that offenders choose behavior that         
makes their choice blameworthy, and they assume offenders 
have free will. 
b. The idea is to make offenders “pay” for their crime 
 
 
c. Underpinnings of retribution: culpability and justice 
      d. Problems with restitution: abstract notions of justice, how much 
is just desert; urge to retaliate isn’t part of civilized society; free 
will debate; crimes without culpability requirement (for 
example, statutory rape) 
2.  Prevention – punishing individuals as only a means of the greater good, 
to prevent, or at least, reduce, future crime 
 
 
 
a. Types of prevention 
i. General deterrence—aims to prevent the general 
population who haven’t committed crimes from doing so 
ii. Special deterrence—aims, by punishing already 
convicted offender, to prevent them from committing 
future crime 
iii. Incapacitation—prevents convicted criminals from 
committing future crimes by locking them up, altering 
them, or executing them 
iv. Rehabilitation—aims to prevent future crimes by 
changing individual offenders so they’ll want to play by 
the rules and won’t commit any more crimes in the 
future 
 
E. Trends in Punishment 
1. Societies have justified punishment on grounds of the four types of 
prevention, but they have emphasized one over the others during 
different times and eras.

2. Sentencing law changes to reflect the prevalent punishment philosophy 
of the time. 
a. indeterminate sentencing laws made prison release dependent on 
the rehabilitation of individual prisoners 
b. determinate sentencing laws-fixed sentences depending on the 
criminal harm suffered by the victim, not the rehabilitation of 
the offender 
 
VIII. Presumption of Innocence and Proving Criminal Liability (LO5) 
A. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence, meaning that that the 
prosecution must prove them guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt before they can 
be convicted 
B. Burden of Proof of Criminal Conduct: Prosecution has burden of proof to 
prove case beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the highest standard of proof 
known to law 
C. Proving the Defenses of Justification and Excuse: Sometimes the burden of 
proof (meaning the burden of production-presenting evidence to the trier of 
fact and the burden of persuasion—convincing the trier of fact) switches to the 
defendant—for example in the case of affirmative defenses, but never on the 
elements of the crime 
 
VIIII. Discretionary Decision Making (LO6) 
A. Although much of criminal law is based on formal laws and rules, invisible 
and informal discretionary decision making has a tremendous impact on what 
happens in the criminal justice process 
B. At each step in the criminal justice process, criminal justice practitioners 
exercise discretion that affects the outcome of the case  
 
X. The Text-Case Method (LO7) 
 
A. Two parts of the book 
 
 
1. The Text defines and explains concepts and principles. 
2. The Case Excerpts test your understanding (and get you to think 
critically by applying definitions, concepts, and principles to real 
cases). 
 
B. The Parts of the Case Excerpts 
1. Each case has a title, a citation, a procedural history, the name of the 
judge who wrote the opinion, a section discussing the facts of the case, 
the court’s decision or judgment, and the court’s opinion. The court’s 
(majority) opinion is made up of the court’s holding and the court’s 
reasoning—or why the court decided as it did. 
 
 
 
a. Majority opinions 
 
 
 
b. Concurring opinions 
 
 
 
c. Dissenting opinions 
C. Briefing the Case Excerpts—In briefing a case, the important things that you 
should note are the important facts of the case, the legal issue that the court had

to address, how the court decided the issues and why (the reasoning—the 
justifications the court gave for deciding how it did).  
D. Summary of briefing cases—Not every case will have every part, so briefing 
cases gets easier with practice. Generally, briefs will always have a facts (what 
happened) section. 
 
XI. Finding Cases (LO7) 
A. The ability to locate a case depends on understanding the components of the 
case citation. A case citation includes the volume of the reporter, the page 
number upon which the case starts, and the year of the decision. 
 
 
CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Not all wrongs are crimes, and using the criminal law is only one mechanism of social 
control.  Criminal law decides who is criminally liable for what crime and what the 
response to that crime should be. Alternately, torts are private wrongs for which a non-
governmental party sues the wrongdoer for monetary damages. Although torts are similar 
to crimes, and sometimes even have the same name as related crimes, they are treated 
differently, and do not result in a conviction with societal condemnation. 
 
Crimes can be classified or graded according to many schemes. The most common are 
felony or misdemeanor. Typically a crime is a felony if it is punishable by at least one 
year in a state prison. Misdemeanors are punishable by one year or less in a local jail. 
Some crimes cover behavior that is inherently evil or bad in itself.  These are called mala 
in se.  Murder is an example of such a crime. Conversely, mala prohibita offenses are 
behaviors that are criminal only because the law says it is.  Parking violations are 
examples of such crimes. Crimes can also be classified according to the subject or the 
value that is harmed. Examples would be crimes against person, property, public order, 
public morals, and the administration of justice.  
 
The criminal law itself can be divided into two parts: the special part of the criminal law 
provides the definitions of various crimes; and the general part provides general 
principles that apply to all offenses. This would include mens rea provisions and 
accomplice liability provisions. The specific part of criminal law is where the definitions 
of crimes are found.  
 
In order to determine what the criminal law is in any jurisdiction within the federal 
system (the states, the nation, or the District of Columbia), one would have to refer to 
several sources.  In total, there are 52 different legal systems within the United States. 
Legislation is only one of several sources of criminal law. American criminal law is 
derived from English common law. Common law was judge-made law based on the 
common customs. Over time, English common law was supplemented or abolished by 
statutes (or codes), but some states still refer to common law as a source of criminal law.  
However, most criminal law is found in state codes and municipal codes. These codes 
have been greatly influenced by the Model Penal Code, which was completed in 1962.

Nevertheless, judges continue to be a source of law by their interpretations of the 
constitution and statutes. Additionally, administrative agencies have been delegated the 
task of creating criminal laws and penalties. 
 
The Constitution establishes a federal system for America. Power is shared and divided 
between the states and federal government. Thus, both the states and the federal 
government can pass criminal laws. We have fifty sets of state criminal law, the criminal 
law in the District of Columbia, and the criminal law of the federal government. 
Although there are some common basic concepts, there are many differences among 
these jurisdictions. 
 
Criminal law is guided by considerations of the purposes of criminal punishment. 
Punishment has two goals: retribution and prevention. Retribution is the idea of an eye 
for an eye. Criminals should be blamed and pay their debt to society. Preventing further 
crime is the second goal. There are four kinds of prevention: general deterrence—which 
punishes someone to make an example of them; special deterrence—which punishes 
offenders to prevent them from committing more crimes; incapacitation—which prevents 
criminals from committing more crimes by locking them up; and rehabilitation—which 
prevents future crimes by changing or treating the individual offender. Although every 
society has justified criminal punishment based upon retribution or the four types of 
prevention, the degree of emphasis has varied in different eras. 
 
In order to impose criminal liability upon an offender, the state generally has to prove its 
case to a jury (or a judge in a bench trial) beyond a reasonable doubt.  The state has the 
burden of proof because under American jurisprudence the defendant has the 
presumption of innocence.  The burden of proof is made up of a burden of production 
(putting on evidence) and the burden of persuasion (convincing the jury to a certain 
level).  Under some circumstances, such as when the defendant raises an affirmative 
defense as an excuse or justification, some states switch the burden of proof to the 
defendant concerning those facts related to the defense.  For example, his mental state 
when he raises the defense of insanity.  
 
Although much of the focus of this book is on the formal law, the reader should be aware 
that informal discretionary decision making by criminal justice practitioners exists at 
every stage of the criminal justice process, and ultimately influences the outcome of the 
case. 
 
The textbook uses the text-case method. It includes explanatory text and excerpts from 
court cases/opinions. Generally, only appellate courts write opinions. The party who 
appeals is called the appellant. The party whose victory in the court below is being 
challenged is called the appellee. 
 
When reading case opinions or excerpts, students need to be able to find the various parts 
of the cases. Only the majority opinion establishes law and the precedent. There may also 
be concurring opinions and dissenting opinions. These may provide well-reasoned 
alternatives to the majority opinion which may, at some later time, become the law of the

land. Two of the most important parts of the case are the holding and the rationale. The 
holding is the legal rule announced by the court that decides the case. The rationale is the 
reasons underlying the holding.   
 
Finally, the reader should be able to find court cases by using the opinion citation system. 
To do this one needs to know the components of a legal citation, including the name of 
the case, the volume, reporter, page, and year of publication. There are a wide variety of 
publications and reporters for different jurisdictions.

Describe the main sources of criminal law. Give examples of each. 
 
There are five main sources of criminal law: the constitution (both State and 
Federal), case law (judge made law), codes/statutes (legislatively made law), 
administrative law (agency made law), and common law (law which developed 
over time deriving from English Common law). Although constitution doesn’t 
specify many crimes (the U.S. Constitution only lists treason), it does govern the 
other sources of law (see chapter two, constitutional limits on criminal law).  
Codes, statutes, and ordinances are the primary source of criminal law, and case 
law is often the court’s interpretation of those codes.  Administrative ordinances 
detail certain behaviors (particularly violations) that carry criminal penalties and 
are therefore a source of criminal law (think of driving offenses, or fish and 
wildlife offenses).  Finally, common law has historically provided most of the 
criminal law (definitions of crime based upon custom and usage in a community), 
but has largely been supplanted with codes.  LO 3 
 
 
2.  
Discuss the evolution from common law system of criminal law to the 
predominantly code system of criminal law.  
 
The earliest forms of English criminal law involved custom and tradition within 
small communities.  Although the law was not written, there was a common 
understanding of what types of behaviors and circumstances were necessary to 
commit certain crimes.  (We often say, “at common law, the elements of Crime X

were A, B, C, and Y”).  As times changed, these elements and circumstances 
changed.  Court decisions also expanded and refined what these laws meant.  As 
America developed and state and federal law-makers became more involved 
(embroiled) in concerns about criminal law, there was a shift from relying on 
tradition to relying on codes or statutes as the primary basis of criminal law.  
Much of the codification of the criminal law (putting the law of crimes into 
statutes) came about not as a rejection of the common law, but a restatement or 
affirmation of the common law principles, filling in gaps or defining concepts left 
ambiguous with the common law.  In other areas, codification allowed legislators 
to “get with the times” and deal with emerging concerns and modern sentiments 
(consider the changes in rape laws discussed in chapter 10).  The Model Penal 
Code was the result of the examination of common law and the discussions about 
what was working, what wasn’t, and what the best approach was.  The Model 
Penal Code, which has not been followed in its entirety by any state, allowed 
states to codify their existing law and to have similar discussions.  Most states 
have abolished common law crimes, and to some extent chosen to adopt to a 
greater and lesser degree provisions of the MPC.  Even when a state has 
completely “abolished the common law,” it may have preserved it by codification, 
allowed it to remain as a source of definitions where terms were left undefined.  
LO 3 
 
3.  
Describe and compare the power of judges, legislators, and administrative 
agencies to make criminal law.  
 
Case law (judge made law) is one of the greatest sources of criminal law.  
Although there has always been a concern about judge made law being 
antidemocratic (law making should be done by elected individuals representing 
the populous), judges have always had to fill in the gaps left open with common 
law and criminal statutes.  Interpreting and defining what the statutes mean is 
arguably law making.  As you read through the cases in this text, you will see that 
the court has to decide whether certain behavior is, for example, pre-meditated.  
The decision of the court in those cases becomes law for the next judges having to 
decide similar cases (the concept of precedent and stare decisis and why judges 
issue written opinions for the cases they review).   Legislators (local, state, and 
federal) all have different titles, but perform similar duties.  They enact new laws 
(statutes and ordinances), modify existing laws, and abolish old laws. Among 
those laws is the body of law known as criminal law, and when legislators 
perform their duties they are said to be “codifying” the criminal law.  Most 
criminal law is a product of legislation.  Administrative agencies make 
administrative law which sometimes has criminal penalties attached.  For 
example, Departments of Motor Vehicles or Fish and Game will enact 
administrative rules—a breach of which results in criminal or quasi criminal 
penalties (fines, incarceration, etc).  LO 3

Describe the goals of punishment and trace the trends in punishment.  
 
Two primary answers (schools of thought) have emerged responding to the 
question “why do we punish criminals?”.  The first answer has been, “because 
they deserve it”—or retribution.  The other answer has been, “so we can stop 
more crime”—or prevention.  Prevention has four types: general deterrence 
(punishing the criminal to make an example of him and thus preventing crime by 
others), special deterrence (punishing the criminal to teach him a lesson and 
preventing his further criminal activity), incapacitation (preventing crime by 
making it impossible for the offender to commit crimes against society—through 
incarceration, surgery, or execution), and rehabilitation (treating or changing the 
offender so that they won’t want to or need to offend).  Because there are strong 
advocates and critics supporting each of these justifications for punishment, 
neither side has ever had a “corner on the market.”  Indeed, one can see that 
historically these approached have waxed and waned cyclically.  The current 
trend in punishment was, until recently, retribution and incarceration.  This is 
evidenced by mandatory minimum sentencing and “three-strikes” sentencing 
schemes that emerged in the late 1980s and have proliferated in the 1990s.   
(Their popularity may however be on the decrease due to their high costs and the 
slumping economy.)  LO 4 
 
5.  
How does the presumption of innocence relate to the burden of proof, the burden 
of production and the burden of persuasion?   
 
The presumption of innocence means that the state (prosecution) has to put on 
evidence (burden of production) to convince the jury or judge (burden of 
persuasion) that the defendant committed the act (standard is beyond a 
reasonable doubt).  The defendant has no obligation to prove that he is not guilty, 
because he is presumed to be not guilty.  Sometimes the defendant has the burden 
to put on some evidence—when there is an affirmative defense.  The burden of 
production is switched to the defendant in these cases because they are claiming 
some special circumstance (for example, if they had an alibi or were claiming 
they were insane).  The defendant doesn’t have to put on much evidence, but has 
to give the state notice that they are raising an affirmative defense, and then 
introduce some credible evidence.  The burden then reverts to the state to put on 
enough more evidence to disprove the defense.  The ultimate burden of proof as to 
the defendant’s guilt as to all the elements of the crime, always remains with the 
state.  LO 5

CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. Constitutional Limits on Criminal Law (LO1)  
A. Constitutional democracy—The Constitution limits what the government can 
make criminal and directs how legislation should be enacted to protect 
individual’s rights. 
B. Rule of Law—System of law in which no person or government is above the 
law.  Created in 1215, in the Magna Carta, by King John.   
C. Principle of Legality (LO2, LO3)  
1. First principle of criminal law 
2. No one can be convicted of, or punished for, a crime unless the law 
defined the crime and prescribed the punishment before they engaged 
in the behavior that was defined as a crime. 
3. Retroactive criminal law making is abhorrent. 
a. Knowing what the law commands gives people the chance to 
obey the law. 
b. The opportunity to obey the law fosters autonomy and human 
dignity. 
c. The ban on retroactive criminal law making regulates officials 
and fosters rule of law. 
 
 
II. The Ban on Ex Post Facto Laws (LO3) 
A. The principle “no crime without law; no punishment without law” (meaning no 
retroactive lawmaking) is so fundamental that it is embodied within the U.S. 
Constitution. Article 1 Section 9 prohibits legislatures from passing ex post 
facto laws.   
B. Kinds of Ex Post Facto Laws 
1. Statues that criminalize innocent acts after they are committed 
2. Statutes which increase the punishment for a crime after it was 
committed—Garner v. Jones (2000) 
3. Statutes which take away a defense that was available to the defendant       
when the crime was committed

Chapter 2: Constitutional Limits on Criminal Law 
29 
 
C. The Purpose of the Ban on Ex Post Facto Laws 
1. Give fair warnings to private individuals 
2. Prevent arbitrary government action 
 
III.  Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine (LO4)  
A. Void-for-Vagueness: Laws which are too vague violate a person’s rights to due 
process. Vague laws fail to warn a person of what the law is, or allow officials 
to arbitrarily decide what the law means, thus they deprive individuals of their 
right to life, liberty, or property.  
 
B. The Aims of the Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine 
 
 
1. Failure to give fair warning to individuals as to what the law prohibits 
 
 
2. Allow arbitrary and discriminatory application of the law—Lanzetta v.  
 
 
    New Jersey  
 
C. Defining Vagueness 
 
 
1. What is fair notice?  
 
 
 
a. “Would an ordinary, reasonable person know that what he was  
 
 
 
       doing was criminal?” 
 
 
2. Minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement 
a. Controlling law enforcement has recently been given more 
priority in the vagueness analysis than whether fair notice is 
provided. 
3. Presumption of constitutionality requires challengers to prove the law is 
vague rather than the government having to prove that it is not too 
vague. 
 
D. Violate the due process guarantees:  
1.  Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ban both federal and state 
     governments from taking any person’s life, liberty or property. 
2.  Criminal punishment deprives individuals of life, liberty or property.  
3.  Failure to warn private persons of what the law forbids  
 
E. Case: State v. Metzger, 1982, 461  
 
IV. Equal Protection of the Laws (LO4)  
A. The 14th Amendment prohibits states from denying a person equal protection of 
law. States don’t have to treat everybody the same. Statutes can in fact treat 
classes of persons differently, but whether the statute will pass constitutional 
muster depends on what the classification is, how narrowly the statute is 
crafted, and how badly and why the state needs to treat the people in the class 
differently. 
B. Race-based classifications—Courts must look at statute with strict scrutiny. 
Thus, such classifications always violate the constitution. 
C. Gender-based classifications—Courts must look at statute with heightened 
scrutiny. State must show a “fair and substantial relationship between the 
classification and a legitimate state end.” 
D. Other classifications—Courts must show that there is a rational basis between 
the classification and the state’s need to treat those falling in that classification 
differently.

E. Example:  Michael M., a 17-year-old male, challenged California’s statutory 
rape law, which defines unlawful sexual intercourse as “an act of sexual 
intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where 
the female is under the age of 18 years.” The U.S. Supreme Court denied the 
equal protection challenge. “The question boils down to whether a State may 
attack the problem of sexual intercourse and teenage pregnancy directly by 
prohibiting a male from having sexual intercourse with a minor female. We 
hold that such a statute is sufficiently related to the State’s objectives to pass 
    constitutional muster” 
 
V. The Bill of Rights and Criminal Law—The Bill of Rights bans defining certain 
kinds of behavior as criminal.  (LO5)  
 
A. Bans making a crime out of free speech, religion, and associations.  
 
B.  Right to bear arms.  
 
C.  Right to privacy  
 
VI. Free Speech—First Amendment to U.S. Constitution  (LO5)  
 
A. Application 
1. Speech is broad in scope, including expressive conduct and giving 
money to candidates 
2. Applies to federal government and to states 
3. Free speech is a fundamental right with preferred status (states need   
compelling interest to limit it). 
4. Some types of speech are not protected, and the government can make       
time, place, and manner restrictions on them. 
a. Obscenity 
b. Profanity 
c. Libel and slander 
d. Fighting words 
e. Clear and present danger 
B. Void-for-Overbreadth Doctrine—When a statute prohibits something that the 
constitution protects, the statute is said to be overbroad. The concern is that 
people will refrain from doing or saying things they have a lawful right to do 
and say because they are afraid they will be prosecuted. The concern then 
becomes that the overbroad statute will have a chilling effect on people’s 
behavior.

C. Case: People v. Rokicki 
 
D. Case: Barns v. Glen Theater, Inc et. al. 
 
E. Case: Texas v. Johnson 
 
 
 
VII. The Right to Privacy (LO1)  
 
A. Application  
1. Right to privacy is found within the “penumbra” of the Constitution, not 
in any specific clause or Amendment. State constitutions may have 
specific provisions regarding the right to privacy.

2. Right to privacy bans “government invasions into sanctity of home and  
 
 
    privacies of life.” 
3. Fundamental right—Each state has to show compelling state interest in 
order to justify invading this right. 
 
B. Case: Griswold v. Connecticut 
 
C. Case: Stanley v. Georgia 
 
D. Case: Lawrence v. Texas 
 
VIII. The Right to Bear Arms (LO5)  
A. Second Amendment—2008 first successful challenge to gun legislation 
B. Case: District of Columbia v. Heller 
1. The core of the Second Amendment is the right of law-abiding, 
responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.  
2. Relatively narrow, but important decision nonetheless 
 
IX. The Constitution and Criminal Sentencing (LO5, LO6)  
A. Barbaric Punishments—Punishments which are no longer acceptable in a 
civilized society; thus, as society evolves, what has been considered barbaric, 
has likewise changed. 
 
 
1. Death itself isn’t cruel and unusual, but if it involves unnecessary  
 
 
     mutilation of the body or pain, it is cruel. 
 
 
2. Case: In re Kemmler 
B. Disproportionate Punishments 
1. Principle of Proportionality—The punishment should fit the crime. 
Very harsh punishments, which are completely out of line with the 
severity of the crime, violate the principle of proportionality. 
2.  Federal (Weems) and state (Robinson) ban on disproportional 
punishment. 
 
C. The Death Penalty: “Death is Different” 
1. Death penalty for crime less than murder 
2.  Case: Kennedy v. Louisiana – Court overturned death sentence for 
defendant convicted of raping a child less than 12 years old.  Court 
pointed to national consensus against death penalty for crimes less than 
murder.   
D. The Death Penalty for the Mentally Retarded 
1. Case: Atkins v. Virginia (2002). The court noted a consistent and 
pervasive change in public opinion against executing retarded offenders 
and held that it was now cruel and unusual punishment to execute 
retarded offenders. Also, retarded offenders aren’t as blameworthy 
(culpable) or subject to deterrence as others. 
2. Must include three elements in its definition of mental retardation:  
 
a. The person has substantial intellectual impairment.  
 
b. That impairment impacts the everyday life of the mentally retarded  
 
     individual.  
 
c. Retardation is present at birth or during childhood.

E. The Death Penalty for Juveniles 
1. Case: Roper v. Simmons (2004). The court overruled earlier opinions 
and decided that due to “evolving standards of decency in a civilized 
society,” it was now cruel and unusual punishment to execute offenders 
who committed their crimes before turning 18 years old. 
 
F. Sentences of Imprisonment  
1. Lack of consensus on whether prison sentences have to be proportionate 
to the crime committed (Solem v. Helm)  
2. Mandatory Minimum—Three Strikes sentences 
a. Disproportionality issue is applicable to mandatory minimum 
and three strikes type of sentences. 
 
 
b. Controversial 
 
 
 
i. Pro—Help restore credibility of the criminal justice  
 
 
   system, deter crime 
 
 
 
ii. Con—Harsh penalties won’t have effect on crime, costly 
 
 
c. Sentences are popular 
 
 
 
d. Case: Ewing v. California 
 
 
3. Fixed (determinate) sentences – a fixed sentence according to the  
 
 
    serious of the crime.  
 
 
4. Sentencing guidelines – sentence depends on a combination of the  
 
 
    seriousness of the crime and prior criminal history score.   
 
G. The Right to “Trial” by Jury  
1. Case: Apprendi v. New Jersey – decision that for the court to do an  
 
upward departure from the presumed guideline sentence, a jury  must 
find beyond a reasonable doubt the factors justifying that sentence 
enhancement. 
2.  Case: Blakely v. Washington—Washington sentencing guidelines 
overturned to the extent that they allowed judge to increase sentence 
beyond guideline without jury finding. 
3.  Case: U.S. v. Booker—Apprendi rule applied to U.S. Sentencing 
Guidelines, guidelines are now advisory and not mandatory  
 
 
4. Case: Gall v. United States—involved downward departure not increase 
 
CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Because the United States is a constitutional democracy, there are limits to the power of 
state and federal governments to create crimes. These limitations are found within the 
U.S. Constitution and the individual state constitutions.  The rule of law means that no 
person is above the law.  It means that the idea of government power should be defined 
and limited by laws.  The principle of legality is the centerpiece of criminal law; it 
provides that no behavior is criminal unless there is already a law banning it, and that no 
one will be punished unless there is already a law setting forth what the punishment is.   
 
The purposes of banning ex post facto and vague criminal statutes are to give fair 
warning to individuals as to what the law prohibits and to prevent arbitrary enforcement 
by public officials. The constitutional basis for banning laws which are so vague that

reasonable private individuals and public officials can’t understand them is that such laws 
deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. 
 
The void for vagueness doctrine illustrates the need for a clear definition of criminal 
behavior, and the associated punishment, so that ordinary people have a clear 
understanding of what is illegal.  The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments are associated 
with this doctrine and highlight the importance of due process.   
 
The U.S. Constitution doesn’t guarantee that criminal laws treat everybody exactly alike; 
it does command that classifying people or behavior differently be reasonable (or have a 
rational basis). Classifications based on gender are subject to a heightened scrutiny by the 
court and the state must show a substantial relationship to the legitimate state interest. 
Classifications based upon race or ethnicity are subject to strict scrutiny (the highest level 
of scrutiny) and are generally always unconstitutional. 
 
The Bill of Rights also limits the type of behavior that can be criminalized.  Under the 
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution the guarantee of free speech is a fundamental 
right. Government action infringing on rights that are deemed fundamental must be 
shown to be more than reasonable. The action must be justified by showing that it 
furthers a compelling governmental interest. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, some 
kinds of non-verbal, expressive conduct are speech; some words aren’t “speech,” and 
some speech isn’t protected by the guarantee of free speech. Obscenity and fighting 
words are examples of speech not protected by the First Amendment.  Additionally, law 
makers need to take care that when criminalizing behavior, they do not write a law so 
broadly that it bans protected expression (the doctrine of overbreadth).  Overbroad 
statutes may have a chilling effect and cause people to avoid engaging in behaviors that 
are constitutionally protected.   
 
The word privacy doesn’t appear in the U.S. Constitution, but the U.S. Supreme Court 
has indicated, in one case, that it lies within the “penumbra” of the Constitution—
meaning that it is implicit in several clauses of the Bill of Rights (the first ten 
Amendments to the U.S. Constitution). Many states do have a specific provision in their 
constitutions protecting the right to privacy of their citizens. The U.S. Supreme Court has 
dealt with privacy issues in matters concerning family life, reproduction, and child 
rearing. Recently the court examined whether statutes criminalizing consensual 
homosexual conduct between adults violated the right to privacy. In deciding that it did, 
the court in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) overruled an earlier 1986 decision. 
 
The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms.  It has been argued that this 
Amendment was poorly worded.  There have been few U.S. Supreme Court cases 
interpreting this amendment in spite of fairly vocal gun rights and gun control activists.  
The first successful challenge based upon the Second Amendment came in 2008, and the 
Court struck down a broad D.C. statute banning possession of handguns, and requiring 
that firearms in the home be nonfunctional.   Although it is an important case, the holding 
is rather limited.

The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the ban on cruel and unusual punishments to 
include barbaric punishments and punishments disproportionate to crimes. The death 
penalty is valid if certain constitutional rules are followed. Recently, the Court has looked 
to the changing standards and sentiments of a civilized community in determining that 
executing retarded individuals, and individuals who committed their crimes before they 
turned 18 years old, both violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.  Additionally, 
the Court has determined that three-strikes types of legislation are not disproportionate, 
and withstands an Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment challenge.  Finally, 
the Court has recently determined that imposition of the death penalty for the rape of a 
child victim was disproportionate punishment. 
 
Many states and the federal government had established sentencing guidelines for judges.  
In Apprendi v. New Jersey, the Court found that judges could not give a higher sentence 
than that specified in the guideline unless a jury had been convinced beyond a reasonable 
doubt of the factors upon which the “upward departure” was based.  Apprendi lead to 
other decisions, and the  Court ultimately threw out the sentencing guidelines to the 
extent that they are anything more than advisory (judges need to consider but don’t have 
to follow the guidelines).   The Apprendi rule still controls, but is limited to, upward 
departures. The Gall decision seems to imply that reasonableness of the sentence may be 
the salient factor, and that appellate courts should defer to the lower courts and only 
overturn if the lower court abused its discretion.

Essay 
 
 
1.  
Discuss the role of the Constitution in limiting criminal law. 
 
The U.S. Constitution constrains what can be criminalized.  For example, 
legislators cannot pas ex post facto laws.  It also guides legislators in how they 
write criminal laws.  For instance, the due process requirement of the Fourteenth 
Amendment has been interpreted to mean that Congress should not pass vague 
statutes or statutes that criminalize conduct which is constitutionally protected 
(doctrine of overbreadth).  The Bill of Rights (first ten Amendments to the 
Constitution) also sets forth some guarantees and personal rights that may 
conflict with legislation, and to the extent that there is conflict, the rights set forth 
in the Constitution trump and the criminal law gives way.  LO 1, 5

2.  
Discuss how the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the 
type of criminal laws that can be passed.  
 
 
 
Although the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection of law, that is 
not a general requirement that government treat everyone the same.  For 
example, some states treat minors differently than adults (think about minor in 
possession laws), and yet, these statutes are constantly upheld as not violating the 
Fourteenth Amendment.  It all boils down to who is being treated differently 
(classification or group of individuals) and why (state’s reason for treating them 
differently.  Most classifications, including those based upon age, certain types of 
employment, and prior criminal history, are said to be “non-suspect” 
classifications, and as long as the state can show that there is a rational basis for 
treating individuals differently than others, the Court won’t find a Equal 
Protection violation.   For example, habitual offenders can be treated differently 
than first time offenders.  Generally, the state will point to its police powers and 
interest in maintaining the public health and safety of its citizens.  Other 
classifications are deemed “suspect classifications.”  These include race and 
ethnicity.  In order to justify treating individuals differently because of race, the 
Court will require the state prove that it has a compelling state interest.  
Additionally, the court must employ strict scrutiny to these types of laws as they 
affect fundamental rights.  In essence, the states have not been able to justify 
race-based classifications.   Finally, statutes treating men and women differently 
will be subject to “heightened scrutiny” meaning that the state will have to prove 
that there is a fair and substantial relationship between gender and a legitimate 
state end.  An example of an unsuccessful attack on a criminal law that treated 
males differently than females is Michal M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County.  
LO 1, 5 
 
3.   
How does the principle of legality conflict with retroactive law making? 
 
The principle of legality, at its core, is a ban on retroactive law making.  The 
principle of legality states that there cannot be a crime without a law, and there 
cannot be criminal punishment without law.  When a person does a behavior that 
society finds reprehensible or blameworthy, then society is free to either 
prosecute the individual for that behavior if there is already a law proscribing it, 
or it may decide to enact a law which will then apply to others who engage in 
similar behavior.  Society cannot enact a law and then apply it retroactively to the 
person.  Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, the ban on ex post facto laws, is 
the embodiment of the principle of legality.  LO 2

Assume that a census worker is killed and the word “fed” is scrawled onto his 
 
back.  Discuss the People v. Rokicki  and R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul cases and cases 
 
mentioned in Rokicki to determine whether the killing could/should be prosecuted 
 
under a hate crime statutes identical to the one in Rockiki. 
 
Hate crime statutes implicate the First Amendment protections on the right to free 
speech.  The First Amendment does not, however, provide limitless protection to 
all speech and clearly the government can regulate some speech (obscenity, 
profanity, libel and slander, fighting words, and speech that presents a clear and 
present danger).  Hate crime statutes, have to be careful though because there is 
the danger that while prohibiting conduct, they may also prohibit speech.  If so, 
they run afoul of the void-for-overbreadth doctrine.  While we can prohibit 
certain conduct, the law should not regulate content.  The legislation in R.A.V. 
was challenged as void for overbreadth and for its chilling effect on speech 
content (it was directed at using symbols in a way to arouse anger or alarm in 
others based upon race, creed, religion, and gender would be guilty of disorderly 
conduct.  The RAV hate crime law was found to be unconstitutional and to violate 
the First Amendment because it was content based (allowed those who were 
proponents of tolerance to evade penalty while those who were opposed to 
tolerance to violate the statute.)  Conversely, in Rokicki, the court found the 
Illinois hate crime statute not to violate the First Amendment as it was directed at 
conduct rather than content (Rokicki’s behavior was unquestionably covered by 
the statute).  The court found that he was being punished not because he held an 
unpopular view but because he allowed those views to trigger his conduct.  The 
Court also upheld the hate crime statute based upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s 
decision in Miller which allowed harsher penalties for bias motivated offenses.   
 
Under the facts in this scenario, the census worker killer probably would not be 
liable for a hate crime if the statute was the same as the Illinois/Rokicki statue 
because being an employee of the federal government is not found within the 
types of group identification the bias motivation is directed against (not race, 
creed, religion, sexual preference, physical or mental disability).  If the statute 
included employment affiliation, then perhaps a prosecution for a hate crime (in 
addition to the murder charge) might be appropriate.  Additionally (and thinking 
back to chapter 1), it is most likely that the motive or anti-government bias may 
be an aggravating factor in the killer’s sentencing for murder.  LO 5

Discuss under what circumstances imposition of the death penalty will be deemed 
 
cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
 
The Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment has 
been interpreted to mean that individuals will not be punished with barbaric 
methods nor will the punishment be disproportionate to the crime. Punishment 
won’t be considered cruel if it is merely the extinguishment of life.  In order to not 
be cruel, death should be both instantaneous and painless, and it cannot involve 
unnecessary mutilation of the body.  Beheading and crucifixion would be cruel 
.

but lethal injection is not (some types of “cut down” procedures to find veins into 
which the injection will be given may be). 
 
Death penalty has recently been held to be disproportionate for a crime which 
does not result in the death of the victim.  Kennedy v. Louisiana overturned a 
capital murder statute in Louisiana which allowed capital punishment for the 
rape of a child victim under the age of 12.  The Court has also said that capital 
punishment is disproportionate penalty for certain types of offenders convicted of 
murder.  Atkins v. Virginia held that application of the death penalty to mentally 
retarded murders violates the cruel and unusual punishment clause.  Roper v. 
Simmons similarly held that application of the death penalty to offenders who 
were less than 18 years old at the time they committed the murder is cruel and 
unusual as it violates evolving standards of decency.  LO 6

CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. The Elements of Criminal Liability (LO1)  
A. There are a number of general principles of criminal liability.  The voluntary 
act (actus reus) is the first requirement. 
 
 
1. Criminal conduct defined 
 
 
2. Criminal liability defined 
B. The government must prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  (LO2)  
1. Criminal act—All crimes must have at a minimum a criminal act 
2. Criminal intent (mens rea)—Some minor crimes don’t have a criminal   
intent 
3. Concurrence—When the criminal intent triggers the criminal act 
4. Attendant circumstances—Required particularly when the crime 
doesn’t  mention   
 
a.  Mens rea (criminal intent) or bad result 
5. Bad result (causing a criminal harm)—Some crimes don’t require a bad 
result

Chapter 3: The Criminal Act: The First Principle of Criminal Liability 
 
53 
 
 
C. Two types of crimes lead to criminal liability.  (LO3)  
 
 
1. Conduct crimes require proving three elements of crimes. 
 
 
 
a. Actus reus (criminal act)  
 
 
 
b. Mens rea (criminal intent)  
 
 
 
c. Concurrence (criminal act triggered by criminal intent)  
2. Result Crimes require proving five elements of crimes. 
 
 
 
a. Actus reus  
 
 
 
b. Mens rea  
 
 
 
c. Concurrence  
 
 
 
 
(1) Actus reus and mens rea produce criminal conduct. 
 
 
 
 
(2) The criminal conduct results in harm. 
d. Causation (must prove the criminal conduct produced criminal 
harm as defined in the criminal statute) 
 
 
 
e. Resulting harm (the specific result defined in the criminal code)  
 
D. MPC non-voluntary acts  
 
 
1. Automatism – unconscious bodily movements  
 
 
2. Fault-based defense – based on creating a reasonable doubt about the  
 
 
    prosecution’s proof of a voluntary act 
 
 
3. Affirmative defense of excuse – insanity and diminished capacity  
 
 
II. The Voluntary Act (Actus Reus) (LO4, LO5) 
A. Three elements of criminal conduct: conduct that is without justification and 
without excuse. 
B. Every crime involves a criminal act, referred to as the actus reus. Actus reus is 
the first principle of criminal liability. 
 
C. We punish people for what they do, not who they are. 
D. We punish people for what they do, not what they think. 
 
 
1. It is impossible to prove a mental attitude by itself. 
 
 
2. Thoughts don’t hurt anyone. 
 
 
3. It is hard to separate daydreaming and fantasy from intent. 
 
 
4. Punishing thoughts is impractical, inequitable, and unjust. 
 
 
5. Manifest criminality leaves no doubt the criminal nature of the act. 
E. Voluntary Acts: Reasoning for the voluntary act requirement  
 
 
1. Criminal law punishes people. 
 
 
2. Criminal law can’t punish without blame. 
 
 
3. There is no blame without responsibility. 
 
 
4. There is no responsibility without a voluntary act (free will). 
 
 
5. Case: Brown v. State  
 
 
6. Case: King v. Cogdon 
 
 
7. Case: People v. Decina 
 
 
8. Case: State v. Jerrett 
 
F. Status as a criminal act (LO6)  
 
 
1. Act is what we do; status is who we are. 
 
 
2. Status is created in two ways. 
 
 
 
a. Voluntary act (first use of alcohol or other drug) 
 
 
 
b. Inherent (race, ethnicity, sex, age)

3. Actus Reus and the U.S. Constitution  (LO7)  
a. Punishment for status violates U.S. Constitution, Amendment 
VIII (cruel and unusual punishment), by the same reasoning a 
voluntary act is required by the principle of actus reus. 
 
 
b. Case: Robinson v. California 
 
 
c. Case: Powell v. Texas 
 
III. Omissions—Failure to act as a criminal act (LO8)  
 
A. Two types of criminal omissions  
 
 
1. Failure to report (accident, income tax)  
 
 
2. Failure to intervene (call for help or rescue)  
 
B. It’s wrong (but not always a crime) to stand by while bad things happen. 
 
 
1. Moral and legal duties differ. 
2. Failure to act is a criminal act only when there’s a legal duty to act, 
created by:  
 
 
 
a. Statute – file income tax return  
 
 
 
b. Contract – police officers  
 
 
 
c. Special relationship – parent-child relationship  
 
 
3. Criminal liability exists only when both of the following are true:  
 
 
 
a. There’s a legal duty to act. 
 
 
 
b. The legal duty is performed unreasonably. 
 
 
4. Failure to perform moral duties does not qualify as a criminal omission. 
5. Two approaches to creating and carrying out legal duties toward 
strangers in trouble: 
a. Good Samaritan doctrine—legal duty to help or summon help 
for strangers in danger – only when it doesn’t put the good  
 
samaritan in harm or danger.  Example: snow storm – person  
 
is obligated to “call” in a traffic crash but is not obligated to  
 
stop and render aid due to the unstable road condition.   
b. American bystander rule (most states)—no legal duty to rescue 
or summon help for strangers 
 
 
 
6. Case: Commonwealth v. Pestinakas  
 
 
 
7. Case: People v. Oliver 
 
 
 
8. Case: State v. Miranda 
 
 
 
9. Story: Kitty Genovese Story 
 
IV. Possession  (LO9)  
 
A. Possession is a passive state, not a positive act. 
 
B. Legal fiction makes it an act for good policy reasons. 
 
 
1. Reduce crime  
 
 
2. Many times possession is the result of a voluntary act. 
 
C. Two aspects of possession  
 
 
1. Control of items and substances

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
One basic principle of criminal liability is the requirement by the prosecution to prove 
every element of a criminal act beyond a reasonable doubt.  
 
Two types of crime, based on their elements, are crimes of criminal conduct and crimes 
of criminal conduct causing criminal harms. Crimes of criminal conduct have a mental 
state and an act triggered by the mental state. The concurrence element requires that the 
act be caused or triggered by the intent (mens rea). Intending to commit a crime is not a 
crime because it hasn’t ripened into a criminal act (actus reus). Crimes of criminal 
conduct causing harm have the additional elements of causation and harm. The act must 
cause the harm. 
 
The actus reus can be a positive act (commission) or failure to act (omission).  A criminal 
act has to be a voluntary bodily movement because we can’t blame people for their 
involuntary acts. Actions refer to what we do; status or condition refers to who or what 
we are. Some conditions we’re born with;   others we produce by our acts. Making a 
disease a crime violates the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It’s a criminal act to stand by and do nothing when 
there’s a legal duty to act. A legal duty to act can be imposed by civil or criminal statutes, 
the common law, a contract, or a special relationship. Actus reus does not include a 
failure to do what one may have a “moral duty” to do. 
 
The MPC defines voluntary by telling us which acts aren’t actually voluntary.  
Automatism are the bodily movements while unconscious, which is not produced by an 
alert consciousness or determination of the person.  Sleepwalking and epileptic seizures 
are both examples of automatism.   
 
There are two types of criminal omissions: failure to report and failure to intervene. 
Criminal omissions create criminal liability only when a legal duty is not reasonably 
performed.  There are three types of legal duties: statutes, contracts, and special 
relationships.  Statutes are those legal duties to report, such as the duty to file an income 
tax return, register a firearm, or report child abuse.  Contracts can be illustrated by a

police officer, who is contracted by his/her jurisdiction to render aide, etc. Special 
relationships focus on parent-child relationships, doctor-patient relationships, and 
husband-wife relationships.   
 
Possession is a passive state, but it can qualify as a criminal act when properly defined by 
law. There are a number of aspects or possible elements of possession crimes: 1) physical 
control of an item; 2) awareness of physical control of some item; and 3) awareness of 
the nature of the item (whether it is contraband or not). Actual possession means the item 
is on your person or within your reach. Constructive possession means the item is under 
your control but not on your person or within your reach. Things which you leave at your 
home, (such as things in your safe for which you have the combination), are 
constructively possessed. Mere possession means you have possession of something, and 
know you have possession, but don’t know the nature of the item (that it is contraband). 
Knowing possession means that you knowingly possess the item, and know that the item 
is contraband. Most states require proof that the possessor knew the item was contraband 
before a conviction can be obtained.

Essay 
 
1. 
Explain why only voluntary acts are crimes. Be sure to provide examples.  
 
Essentially, we only hold people who are blameworthy liable for their actions.  In 
order to be blameworthy, the individual had to have some control over their 
actions; thus, the acts must be voluntary.  Convulsions, acts done while under 
hypnosis, while asleep, or while unconscious are all deemed involuntary acts 
because the individual has no control over them.  They are not the product of a 
voluntary act.  The term voluntary, should not be confused with the mens rea of 
intentional, but should incorporate a conscious decision that causes a bodily 
movement.   The MPC has broadened the scope of voluntary acts to include 
behavior that demonstrates one voluntary act even though it is surrounded by 
other involuntary acts.  The example given is an individual who voluntarily gets in 
a car to drive knowing they are subject to fainting spells.  Fainting is not a

voluntary act, but getting in the car to drive is, so the MPC’s “one-voluntary-act-
is enough” definition would cover this scenario.  LO 3 
 
2. 
Compare and contrast actual and constructive possession. Provide examples of 
each.   
 
Actual possession means physical possession by one who knows what they 
possess.  If Bob is carrying a wallet in his pants pocket which contains a baggie 
of illegal drugs and he knows he has the wallet/drugs, he is commits the voluntary 
act of actual possession.  Constructive possession includes situations where the 
individual does not physically possess the item, but has the right and ability to 
control the item.  If Bob gives Fred his backpack to hold while he goes on a 
carnival ride, and in the backpack there is a stash of marijuana, Bob is said to be 
in constructive possession of marijuana because he has the right and ability to 
control the backpack.  LO 7   
 
3. 
Compare and contrast knowing and mere possession. Provide examples of each.  
 
Knowing possession applies to either actual or constructive possession and 
requires that the possessor is aware of what they possess.  For example, in the 
scenario above, Fred is in actual possession of Bob’s backpack, but may or may 
not knowingly possess the marijuana stash (depending on whether he is aware of 
the contents of the backpack).  Likewise, Bob is in constructive possession of the 
backpack, but he may or may not have knowing possession (presumably he knows 
what is in his backpack, but there may be circumstances under which he does 
not.)  Mere possession means that the person has actual or constructive 
possession of something, but does not realize what he possesses.  If Fred does not 
know about the marijuana stash in the backpack, he only has mere, but not 
knowing possession.  Most states require knowing possession for there to be 
criminal liability, but two states allow mere possession to be the basis of criminal 
liability.  LO 7 
 
4. 
Under what circumstances can an omission to act be deemed the actus reus of a 
crime?  Be sure to provide examples. 
 
 
Omission can only be the actus reus requirement when there is a legal duty to act.  
Legal duties can come from various sources: statutes, relationships, contracts.  
Criminal omissions stem from failure to report or failure to intervene. A criminal 
omission for failure to report may include the failure to file income tax returns.  A 
criminal omission for failure to intervene would include a parent’s failure to seek 
treatment for their child (based upon relationship).  The case of People v. Oliver 
illustrates a criminal omission for failure to intervene based upon a relationship 
created by “assumption of care.” She took the victim from a place where he could 
get treatment to her residence where he could not, thus establishing a special 
(although not formal) relationship.  LO 6

5. 
Compare and contrast the Good Samaritan doctrine and the American bystander 
rule. 
 
No criminal liability can be predicated upon an individual’s moral duty to 
intervene.  However, some states by statute, adopt the position that a person has a 
duty to aid a stranger in peril (if they can do so without risking harm to 
themselves).  This approach is called the Good Samaritan Doctrine, and the few 
states which have adopted this approach impose a legal duty upon individuals to 
call for help for imperiled strangers.  The American Bystander approach, which is 
followed by most states, imposes no duty to render aid—even if the “bystander 
risks nothing by helping.” LO 6

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. To understand and appreciate that most serious crimes require criminal intent and 
a criminal act. 
2. To understand the difference between criminal intent and motive.   
3. To understand the difference between general and specific intent. 
4. To understand and appreciate the differences in culpability among the Model 
Penal Code’s (MPC) four mental states: purposefully, knowingly, recklessly, and 
negligently. 
5. To understand that criminal liability, sometimes, is imposed without fault (also 
known as a strict liability). 
6. To know the definition of concurrence and why it’s important in criminal liability 
considerations.   
7. To understand that the element of causation applies only to “bad result” crimes 
and to be able to differentiate cause from legal cause. 
8. To understand that ignorance of facts and law can create a reasonable doubt that 
the prosecution has proved the element of criminal intent.

CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. The Principle of Mens Rea (LO1) 
 
Mens rea is the mental element of a crime that the prosecution must prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt. There are varying degrees of mens rea, and it is possible that a different 
mens rea is required for different elements of the crime (one for the voluntary act, one for 
the harm, and a different for causation). Thus, mens rea law is complicated and 
somewhat confusing.   
A. Serious crimes require both a criminal act (actus reus) and criminal intent 
(mens rea). 
 
B. Proving “State of Mind”—Proof of mens rea 
 
 
1. We can’t see intent or measure it directly. 
 
 
2. We infer intent from actors’ actions (circumstantial evidence). 
 
 
3. Confessions are the only direct evidence of mens rea. 
C. Criminal Intent—Four kinds of mens rea (criminal intent or blameworthy state 
of mind)  (LO2)  
1. Mens rea consists of four states of mind with different levels of 
culpability.  
2. Motive, although it may or may not be relevant, is not the same thing as 
mens rea. Also, motive may be an element of a crime (for example, the 
“attendant circumstance” in burglary). 
3. Subjective fault, objective fault, and no-fault liability 
 
 
a. Subjective fault requires “bad mind of the actor. 
b. Objective fault does not requires conscious bad mind but is 
present when a reasonable person would have known something 
that the actor claims he didn’t know. 
c. Strict liability is when the law makes certain behavior a crime, 
even if the person didn’t have any guilty mind. 
4. General Intent and Specific Intent (not the MPC approach) (LO3)  
 
 
a. General intent 
 
 
 
i.  Intent to engage in the criminal act

b. Specific intent—Sometimes limited to subjective fault

c. General-Intent-Plus—the intent to commit actus reus plus some 
other mental element of a crime 
 
 
 
d. Case: Harris v. State 
5. The Model Penal Code’s (MPC’s) Mental Attitudes—The four levels of 
culpability are: (LO4)  
a. Purpose (or intentionally)—Acting on purpose and/or with the 
conscious object of causing harm 
 
 
i. Case: State v. Stark 
b. Knowledge—Acting knowingly but without the conscious 
purpose or object of causing harm 
 
 
i. Case: State v. Jantzi 
c. Recklessness—Acting with a conscious creation of a high risk of 
harm 
 
 
i. Case: Koppersmith v. State 
d. Negligence (or criminal negligence)—Acting with an 
unconscious creation of a high risk of harm 
 
 
i.  Case: Koppersmith v. State 
D. Liability without Fault: Strict liability offenses don’t require culpability (i.e., 
mens rea) (LO5)  
 
 
1. Justifications for strict liability 
 
 
 
a. The offenses are a danger to public health, safety, and morals. 
 
 
 
b. Penalties are limited to fines as the only punishment. 
 
 
2. Criticisms of strict liability 
 
 
 
a. It violates the basic idea of punishment for culpability. 
 
 
 
b. It could be expanded to include more serious crimes. 
 
 
3. Case: State v. Loge 
 
II. Concurrence: The required relationship between intent and act (LO6)  
 
A. Mens rea triggers the criminal act 
 
B. Criminal conduct causes the criminal harm 
 
C. Example: Shafeah hates her sister Nazirah and plans to kill her by running over  
 
     her with her Jeep Grand Cherokee. Coincidentally, just as Shafeah is headed   
 
     toward Nazirah in her Cherokee, a complete stranger in an Audi TT appears  
 
     out of nowhere and accidentally runs over and kills Nazirah. Shafeah gets out  
 
     of her Grand Cherokee, runs over to Nazirah’s dead body, and gleefully dances  
 
     around it. Although definitely a creepy thing to do, Shafeah’s not a murderer  
 
     because her criminal conduct (driving her Cherokee with the intent to kill  
 
     Nazirah) didn’t cause Nazirah’s death. Concurrence here means the criminal  
 
     conduct has to produce the criminal harm; the harm can’t be a coincidence 
 
III. Causation: The required relationship between act and harm (LO7)  
 
A. Applies only to crimes of criminal conduct causing criminal harm

B. Two kinds of causation 
 
 
1. Factual (“but for” or “except for”) cause 
 
 
 
a. Is an empirical question of fact 
b. “Except for” or “but for” an act by the defendant that triggered a 
chain of events, would this criminal harm have occurred? 
 
 
 
c. A necessary but not sufficient cause for proving causation 
 
 
2. Legal (proximate) cause 
a. Based on a subjective question of fairness: Should the defendant 
be blamed and punished for this injury or death? Is it fair to hold 
the defendant responsible? 
b. Two types of intervening acts in the chain between the 
triggering act of the defendant and the criminal harm: 
i.  Coincidental intervening acts break the causal chain 
unless they’re predictable or foreseeable. 
ii.  Responsive intervening acts only break the causal chain 
if: 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) They’re abnormal; or, 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) They’re not predicable or foreseeable 
iii. Superseding causes—cut off liability, they are not 
predictable nor foreseeable. 
 
 
3. Case: People v. Armitage 
 
 
4. Case: Velazquez v. State 
 
 
5. Case: People v. Kibbe 
 
 
 
IV. Ignorance and Mistake—Ignorance is not knowing what the facts are; mistakenness 
is not being correct in what you think you know are the facts or the law. (LO8)  
A. Mistake is a defense when mistake prevents the formation of mens rea. 
B. Debate over whether mistake is a defense to criminal liability or a failure 
to prove criminal liability (because they lack the mens rea requirement) 
C. Mistake “doesn’t work” with strict liability offenses (because they do 
not require a mental element, failure to show mental element means 
nothing) 
D. Case: State v. Sexton 
E. Example: Suppose it’s a crime in your state for a bartender 
      to sell alcoholic beverages to anyone under twenty-one for the purpose           
    of supplying a minor with an alcoholic beverage. You’re a bartender;  
      you believe the customer you just sold to is twenty-one because she  
    showed you a driver’s license with a birth date more than twenty-two  
  years prior to today’s date. In fact, she’s eighteen. Your mistake negates  
    the mental element of purpose.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Most crimes have a mens rea or mental element that must be proven by the prosecution 
beyond a reasonable doubt. The basic idea is that it is not fair to punish someone unless 
they had some form of mental fault or blameworthiness.   
 
The mental element can apply to or modify other elements of a crime, and thus a crime 
can have more than one mental element. For instance, the mens rea can apply to the act, 
the harm, or the circumstances. 
 
General intent means intent to do the criminal act. Specific intent means an intent that 
applies to any other element of the crime other than the criminal act. General-intent-plus 
crimes are those that require the intent to commit the criminal act, plus some other mental 
element. 
 
There are many different types of intent or culpability in various jurisdictions. Many 
states follow the Model Penal Code approach of having only four types of culpability or 
mens rea:  Purpose means it was the actor’s conscious object; knowing means that the 
actor knew something was likely to happen or occur; recklessness means that the person 
was aware of a serious risk but went ahead and took that risk anyway even though an 
objectively reasonable person would not have taken that risk; and negligence means the 
actor did not conform to the external, objective standard of what a reasonable person 
would have known or done in the same circumstances. Purpose and knowing are 
subjective mental states. Recklessness is both objective and subjective. Negligence is a 
totally objective standard. 
 
A few crimes impose liability without fault because they do have a mens rea element. 
These strict liability crimes are controversial because they can punish persons who had 
no mental fault. A person could be punished for an accident. The court has allowed strict 
liability crimes when it is clear that the legislature intentionally omitted the mens rea 
requirement, when the public health and welfare is at stake, and when the offenses are 
relatively minor. 
  
If a crime has a harm or result element, the prosecution must prove that the defendant 
caused the harm beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution must prove that the 
defendant’s acts were both the cause in fact (“but for” cause) and the proximate or legal 
cause. Cause in fact is an empirical or factual issue. Proximate or legal cause involves the 
question of whether it is fair or just to make the defendant responsible for a harm that 
occurred in an unusual fashion. For instance, sometimes a defendant will act and set a 
chain of events in motion, but some other events will occur after the defendant’s act and 
contribute to causation of the harm. In general, if this intervening cause was normal and 
foreseeable, the defendant will not be relieved of liability for the harm. 
 
When a person is honestly mistaken as to the fact of something (and that mistake matters) 
it may be said that he or she lacks the required mental state about an element of a crime, 
or that they have an excuse defense. Thus, there will generally be no criminal liability in

the case of a mistaken fact. Some characterize mistake as a defense or excuse, others 
characterize it as a failure of proof.   The mental element required by the statutes is 
important in determining whether a mistake will affect criminal liability. Mistake cannot 
be a defense to a strict liability offense because these offenses require no mens rea. 
 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
 
1. Discuss the differences between criminal intent and motive?  How would you 
prove both if you were a prosecutor?  How would you defend against both if you 
were a defense attorney?  (LO1, LO2) 
  
2. Discuss the differences between general and specific intent?  Which one is worse?  
Why?  (LO3) 
 
3. Discuss how ignorance of facts and law can create a reasonable doubt?  If you 
were a prosecutor, how would you prove the person wasn’t ignorant of the 
facts/law?  (LO8)

Compare and contrast specific and general intent. Provide examples.   
 
The meaning of general intent differs, but generally, general intent means the 
intent to engage in the voluntary act/omission/or possession.  Some jurisdictions 
define general intent as the intent to commit a crime with no specific time or 
victim in mind.  Other jurisdictions define general intent as the same thing as 
mens rea—meaning all levels of criminal intent.  Specific intent generally means 
that the person intends the actus reus of the crime, plus some other special 
element.  It could also mean to specifically intend the harm done.  In chapter nine, 
you will read that first degree murder is a specific intent crime.  This means that 
the murderer has to intend to commit the act and intend that the person die.  In 
chapter ten you will read that arson is a general intent crime.  What that means is 
that the person needs to intend to light something afire, it does not require that 
the person intend to burn down the building.  LO 2

2. 
Define and discuss strict liability crimes. What is the justification for such 
crimes? 
 
 
A strict liability crime is one in which the legislators intentionally decided to omit 
the mens rea requirement.  Generally strict liability crimes are said to be minor in 
nature (but this isn’t always so), or involve heavily regulated areas (such as 
traffic infractions).  Strict liability crimes are permissible when they make clear 
that they impose liability without fault, that they protect the public health and 
safety, and when the penalty is not too severe.  It is, nevertheless, problematic to 
make behavior blameworthy when it is not intentional, knowing, reckless, or even 
negligent. LO 4 
 
3. 
What does the criminal law require in the way of a relationship between the act 
and intent? Why is this relationship important? Be sure to provide examples.  
 
The concurrence requirement of criminal law means that the criminal intent has 
to trigger the voluntary act.  The relationship is important because we don’t hold 
people blameworthy for accidents.  They may be civilly liable and have to pay 
damages, but criminal law is about blameworthiness and societal condemnation.  
If, for example, I back over my neighbor (whom I dislike) while backing up out of 
my driveway, this will not be a criminal act, unless I acted with negligence (gross 
deviation from the standard of care of a reasonable person).  My actions were not 
triggered by my criminal intent.  On the other hand, if I think about the myriad of 
ways to be rid of my neighbor but do nothing, that too is not culpable behavior.  
My criminal intent did not trigger any action.  Only when the actus reus and the 
mens rea come together at the same time is there a violation of the criminal law. 
LO 1 
 
4.  
Compare and contrast factual causation and legal causation. Why must the 
defendant be both the factual and legal/proximate cause of the harm in order for 
him to have liability? When will intervening variables cut off liability? Give 
examples.   
 
 
Behavior that sets in motion a chain of events which leads to a particular result is 
a factual cause.  If you can answer yes to the question, “but for X, would Y not 
have occurred?” then you have a factual cause.  For example, John is driving his 
car on a rainy night, and Sam is his passenger.  John fails to negotiate the turn 
and drives off the road into a field.  Sam hits his knee on the dashboard when the 
car comes to a stop.  But for John’s driving off the road, Sam would not have hurt 
his knee.  John is the factual or but/for cause of Sam’s injury.   
 
Legal causation (also known as proximate cause) answers the question of 
fairness.  Is it fair to hold someone responsible for the harm just because they 
initially set into motion a chain of events (were the factual cause?  Many factors 
help determine fairness: was the harm foreseeable, did someone else contribute in 
a more substantial way to the harm, did the victim himself contribute to the harm?

These other factors are called intervening variables, and the ones that cut off 
liability are often referred to as superseding variables. For example, John is 
driving quickly on a rainy night when the roads are slippery, and Sam is his 
passenger.  John fails to negotiate a turn and drives off the road into a field. Sam 
hits his knee and the ambulance responds and transports Sam.  As the ambulance 
drives through town, another car plows into it and Sam is killed.  Is it fair to hold 
John liable for Sam’s death just because he started the sequence of events? Is it 
fairer to hold the driver of the car that plowed into the ambulance liable?  
Although not definitive, generally intervening variables will cut off liability when 
they are unforeseeable. Say for example, Sam is transported to the hospital for his 
injured leg and a crazed person enters the hospital room, shooting everyone in 
sight and killing Sam. It may be foreseeable that an ambulance might encounter 
drivers who can’t stop for them, but completely unforeseeable that a person 
would shoot Sam in the hospital waiting room.  LO 5 
 
5.  
List and define the four types of mens rea required in the Model Penal Code.  
Give examples of each. 
 
 
The highest level of mens rea under MPC § 2.02 is purposely.  A person acts 
purposely when they act with a conscious objective to engage in the conduct or to 
cause a result.  For example, John goes to the playground behind his house with a 
slingshot.  He sees his enemy Sam and thinks to himself, I am going to kill him 
with this pebble.  John picks up the pebble, puts it into the slingshot, aims at Sam, 
pulls the sling back, and lets it fly. The pebble hits Sam square in the forehead 
and Sam dies.  John has acted purposely.  He intended to engage in the conduct 
and he intended to cause the result. 
 
The next highest level of mens rea is knowingly.  A person acts knowingly if he is 
aware of the nature of his conduct (conduct crimes) and is aware that it is 
practically certain that his conduct will cause a certain result (bad result crime).  
For example, same as above, but John does not necessarily intend that Sam die.  
John is aware that he is shooting the slingshot, and is practically certain (because 
he is a good shot and has seen the results of slingshot wounds) that his conduct 
will cause Sam’s death. 
 
The next highest level of mens rea is recklessly.  A person acts recklessly when he 
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk by engaging in the 
behavior (conduct crime) and that a result will occur (bad result crime).  For 
example, the same scenario as above, but John sees a group of kids on the 
playground (not Sam), he doesn’t mean to hit any of them, isn’t certain that he 
will even get with in the area, but does realize there is a risk that when he shoots 
the pebble off into their area that it could hit them and hurt them.  Nevertheless, 
he lets it fly.  One child is struck and dies. 
 
The last level of mens rea is negligently.  A person acts negligently when they act 
failing to be aware of the risk that their actions cause.  In order for a negligent

action to be criminal, the  risk has to be substantial and such that a reasonable 
person would be aware that his conduct creates a risk.  It has to be a “gross 
deviation from the standard of care of a reasonable person.”  For example, John 
is at the playground with the slingshot.  He doesn’t see the group of kids but he 
should have, or he doesn’t aim the slingshot in their direction, but should have 
been aware that he was a really bad shot and needed to make sure that no one 
was around when he shot off pebbles.  The difference between the reckless mens 
rea and the negligent mens rea is awareness of the risk.  See Koppersmith case 
for an example.  LO 3

disprove such defenses.  
 
C. Results of defendants’ successful proof of defense  
 
 
1. Perfect defenses—An acquittal results. 
 
 
2. Imperfect defenses—Reduce the crime to a lesser offense.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
The two primary types of defenses are justification defenses and excuse defenses.  
Justifications free defendants from criminal liability because they prove the defendants 
aren’t blameworthy. Their criminal acts were right or justified. An example is self-
defense, which excuses defendants from criminal liability.  An example of excuse 
defense is the insanity defense.  One other type of defense which isn’t as common as the 
above two, is the failure-of-proof defense which states that the defendant only has to raise 
a reasonable doubt about the prosecution’s proof of one element in the crime.  It can be 
any element or elements.  For example, in King v. Cogdon, the defense cast a reasonable 
doubt on Mrs. Cogdon’s act of killing her daughter Pattie by showing that she swung the 
ax during the involuntary act of sleepwalking.     
 
When defendants raise affirmative defenses they generally have the burden of 
production; that is they must produce evidence to support their defense.  Sometimes they 
also have the burden of persuasion, meaning they have to prove to the jury that they acted 
in accordance with the defense.  Generally, when defendants meet the burden of 
production and persuasion they are exonerated (this means that the defense was a “perfect 
defense”), but sometimes defenses are imperfect defenses, which only reduce the liability 
of the defendant.

Justification defenses are exceptions to the rule of law. They allow individuals to take the 
law into their own hands. According to the rule of law, the government has a monopoly 
on the use of force. Use of force by individuals must be justified by law. 
 
Mitigating circumstances are instances that convince fact finders (judges and juries) that 
defendants don’t deserve the maximum penalty for the crime they’re convicted of.    
 
Self-defense is a concession to necessity, and is only justified when the force is 
reasonable and immediately necessary for defense. Deadly force is justified only when 
the necessity is unprovoked and the attack involves threatened death or serious bodily 
injury. The amount of force used must be the minimum amount reasonably necessary to 
defend against an imminent threat. The general rule is that a person must retreat if they 
can safely do so before using deadly force. This rule puts a premium on human life, even 
the life of an attacker. The castle exception and the rules regarding the defense of home 
clearly demonstrate that the ancient doctrine that homes are castles is still alive and well. 
In general, a person is not required to retreat from, or in, their own home before using 
deadly force.  An initial aggressor is someone who provokes an attack and then can’t use 
force to defend himself against the attack he just provoked.     
 
New Castle laws have proliferated recently and seem to expand the right to use deadly 
force.  Under these laws, individuals are allowed to use deadly force—without any duty 
to retreat—in order to protect themselves whenever they are in their home or a place they 
have a lawful right to be.   These laws provide immunity from prosecution and civil 
action.   
 
The right to defend others includes everyone from close family members to any stranger 
who needs immediate protection from attack. The same rules apply as in self-defense. 
 
The choice-of-evils defense is also based on necessity. This defense protects those who 
make the choice to commit a lesser crime in order to avoid the imminent harm of a 
greater crime or social harm. The crime results in a “net social good.” 
 
The general rule is that consent by the victim is not a defense. However, consent is a 
defense to some crimes in some circumstances. The consent must be knowing and 
voluntary. The value of individual autonomy (not necessity) is the heart of the defense of 
consent.  An authorized consent occurs when somoene who has the authority to grant 
such consent does so.

Essay 
 
1. 
Define, compare, and contrast justification and excuse defenses.  
 
 
 
When a defendant claims a defense of justification, he argues that, although he is 
responsible for his actions, what he did was not wrong but in fact justified under 
the circumstances. When a defendant claims a defense of excuse, he argues, 
although what he did was wrong, he is not responsible for his behavior for 
whatever excuse he puts forth (insanity, age, intoxication, duress).  Both 
justification and excuse are defenses which may be perfect defenses (completely 
exonerating the defendant) or imperfect defenses (which reduce, but do not 
exonerate, criminal liability).  Justifications and excuses may be affirmative 
defenses that place a burden on the defendant to put forth some evidence of why 
he is either not responsible or not wrong.  LO 4

2. 
Discuss the elements of and limitations to the defense of consent.  
 
The defense of consent embraces the notion of personal autonomy—that mentally 
competent adults should decide whether they want themselves to be violated, and 
that the government should not interfere.  Obviously, at the core of the crime of 
rape is the lack of consent (see chapter eleven), but consent also justifies other 
behaviors as well. Most states allow the consent defense in four situations: when 
no serious injury results from the consensual crime, when the injury happens 
during a sporting event, when the conduct benefits the person who consented 
(surgery, for example), and when the consent is to sexual conduct.  In order to 
raise a valid defense of consent the “victim” must have given both voluntary 
(unforced or threatened) consent and knowing consent (they knew what they were 
agreeing to).  State v. Shelley shows some of the limits of the consent defense, 
even under circumstances where consent is recognized—sporting events.  In 
Shelley the court found that the victim did not give implied consent to the injury 
that occurred during a basketball game.  The court reasoned that the defendant’s 
conduct exceeded what was considered within the rules of the sport.  Consider the 
game of boxing: contenders consent to be hit repeatedly, but they do not consent 
to have their ears bitten off.  LO 12 
 
3. 
Discuss the elements of and limitations to choice-of-evils defense. 
 
Choice of evils defense, also known as necessity, is a justification which allows a 
defendant to claim that what he did was not wrong under the circumstances 
because he made the right choice and chose the lesser of evils.  The MPC and 
most states require the defendant successfully raising this defense to identify the 
evils, rank the evils, and choose the lesser of the evils.  In essence, the defendant 
is claiming that they needed to violate the law in order to avoid a more serious 
harm.  One limit to the choice of evils defense occurs when the legislature has 
already ranked and chosen the evil—a legislative preemption to the defense.  This 
issue is seen in State v. Ownbey and People v. Gray et. al. LO 11 
 
4. 
Discuss the evolution of the New Castle Exceptions (to the retreat rule). 
 
Historically, the law of self-defense allowed the use of deadly force to meet 
unprovoked and unlawful use of deadly force against the defenders.  Some states 
required an individual to retreat if they could do so safely before employing 
deadly force in self-defense.  In those states requiring retreat, there generally was 
a “castle exception” which allowed individuals to stand their ground (refuse to 
retreat) in their own homes.  Historically, the law of defense of property and 
habitation allowed individuals to use force to protect their property and 
habitation (homes) but they could not use deadly force to protect their property or 
homes. The question that arose from these general rules is what a person was 
supposed to do when their homes were invaded but it wasn’t really clear what the 
intent of the intruder was. Was it to do the person harm, or was it merely to do the 
property/home harm?  Although the text mentions that the new castle laws

expanded the right to use deadly force in self-defense, (remember deadly force 
could always be used to repel unlawful, unprovoked, imminent deadly force), 
these laws really clarified by creating presumptions concerning the beliefs of the 
defender and the intent of the intruder.  Also, they create civil and criminal 
immunity for anyone using force permitted by the law (they can’t be prosecuted or 
sued). The text also notes that these laws broaden the legitimate circumstance 
where deadly force applies; they include intrusions into occupied vehicles.  The 
laws have evolved in response to home invasions, carjackings, etc. LO 10 
 
5. 
Discuss the elements of and limitations to a successful claim of self-defense. 
 
 
The justification of self-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, 
including deadly force, to repel the unlawful, unprovoked and imminent use of 
force by another.  The defender has to honestly and reasonably believe they are 
faced with the choice of kill or be killed before they can use deadly force (force 
that likely to cause death).  Excessive force is not allowed.  The defender can only 
use force when needed to repel an imminent threat.   It is not self-defense when a 
person takes pre-emptive action.  It is not self-defense when a person uses force in 
retaliation.  Both of those situations do not present the “imminent danger of 
attack” needed to be proved in a successful self-defense claim.  The final 
requirement is that the defender did not provoke the attack.  A person who is the 
initial aggressor in an incident can’t then turn around and use force to defend 
against an individual who was only using force in self-defense.  The exception to 
the “can’t be the initial aggressor” rule is if the initial aggressor completely 
withdraws from the attack and then finds himself being attacked by the individual 
who initially was not the aggressor. The hallmark of self-defense is 
reasonableness.  The behaviors of the person using the force will be measured in 
terms of what a reasonable person would have done or thought under the 
circumstances, not what this individual himself actually thought or believed. LO 4

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. To understand that defendants who plead an excuse defense admit what they did 
was wrong but argue that, under the circumstances, they weren’t responsible for 
their actions. 
 
2. To know that the defense of insanity excuses criminal liability when it seriously 
damages defendants’ capacity to control their acts and/or capacity to reason and 
understand the wrongfulness of their conduct. 

3. To understand that insanity isn’t the same as mental disease or defect.  
 
4. To appreciate that very few defendants plead the insanity defense, and those who 
do rarely succeed. 
 
5. To understand how the right-wrong test focuses on defect in reason or cognition.

or will. 


resulting from mental diseases.  
 
8. To understand how the substantial capacity test focuses on reason and self-
control. 

9. To know why current trends favor shifting the burden of proof for insanity to 
defendants.  

10. To understand the difference between diminished capacity and diminished 
responsibility and appreciate how they apply only to homicide.  

11. To understand the different processes regarding how the law handles age and that

CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. Excuses are a form of defense to a criminal charge.  (LO1)  
 
A. Difference between justification and excuse  
1. Justification—Admits responsibility, but, under the circumstances, 
claims it was the right thing 
2. Excuse—Admits doing wrong, but, under the circumstances, claims not 
legally responsible 
 
B. Two theories: 
1. Affirmative defense of insanity, the legal excuse that defendants aren’t 
responsible for their criminal conduct because it was caused by a mental 
disease or defect  
2. Failure of proof theory of excuse—defendants raise reasonable doubt 
about the prosecutions case, particularly its failure to prove the mental 
element) 
 
II. Insanity—Insanity is a defense based on a defendant’s mental disease or defect.  
(LO2, 3)  
A. Definition—The defendant was so mentally diseased, he couldn’t know nature 
of acts or control actions. 
 
B. A legal, but not a medical, concept  
 
C. Rationale—can’t blame people who aren’t responsible 
 
D. Few plead insanity; of those who do, few succeed. 
 
E. Consequence of successful plea of insanity—civil commitment, not freedom

    “products” of mental disease or defect excuse criminal liability  
 
J. The Burden of Proof (LO9)   
1. States vary as to who has to prove insanity and to what level of 
certainty. 
a. Federal law prior to the Hinckley case, for example, required 
government to prove the defendant was not insane beyond a 
reasonable doubt.

insanity defense 
B. Limited to diseases or defects that make it impossible to form the intent 
required to commit the crime 
C. Is not the same as diminished responsibility (a defense of excuse) 
D. In practice, both diminished capacity and the diminished responsibility defense 
apply only to homicide. Most states use them to reduce first degree to second 
degree murder (Some from murder to manslaughter). 
 
IV. Age—Age is a defense or a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction. (LO11, 12)  
A. Immaturity excuses criminal liability, but statutes vary as to the age of 
capacity. 
 
B. Age of maturity varies, but three stages at common law and later: 
 
 
1. Early childhood—can’t form criminal intent (irrebuttable presumption) 
2. Middle childhood—refutable presumption against capacity to form 
intent 
 
 
3. Adult—conclusive presumption of capacity to form intent 
 
C. Age can aggravate as well as excuse criminal responsibility.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Defendants who plead excuses admit that what they did was wrong, but claim they 
weren’t responsible because of mental abnormality or unusual circumstances.  
Affirmative defense of insanity is the legal excuse that defendants aren’t responsible for 
their criminal conduct because it was caused by a mental disease or defect. 
 
The excuse of insanity is rarely used, rarely successful, and almost always leads to at 
least temporary civil commitment if successful. The defense of insanity stands for the 
proposition that we can’t blame people who aren’t responsible because of mental diseases 
or defects that impair their reason or will. Insanity is not the equivalent of mental disease 
or defect; rather, it is caused by mental disease or defect. 
 
There are a number of tests of the insanity defense. The right-wrong (M’Naghten) test 
focuses on defects in reason. The product-of-mental-illness test (Durham rule) focuses on 
criminal acts which are the result of mental disease. According to the Durham rule, acts 
that are the “products” of mental disease or defect excuse criminal liability.  The 
irresistible impulse test focuses on defects in volition or self-control. The substantial 
capacity test (Model Penal Code) focuses on reason and self-control. Insanity is an 
affirmative defense in which the actual burden of proof varies, depending on the 
jurisdiction.  
 
John Hinckley, who attempted to assassinate President Reagan, was found not guilty by 
reason of insanity. This verdict troubled many and may have been caused by the fact that 
the prosecution was required to prove that Hinckley was sane beyond a reasonable doubt.

Subsequent federal legislation places the burden on the defendant to prove their insanity 
with clear and convincing evidence. Some states have also changed their laws, placing 
the burden of proof on the defendant.  
Diminished capacity involves mental disease or defect that does not qualify for the 
insanity defense. It may reduce the degree of a crime because it impairs the capacity to 
specific intent. If successful, it may reduce the crime to a lower level or complete 
acquittal because the required mens rea cannot be proven. The insanity defense leads to a 
special verdict. 
 
Age can excuse criminal liability, but it can also increase it. At common law, there was 
an irrefutable presumption that a child under seven couldn’t form criminal intent. 
Between seven and fourteen, there was a refutable presumption of incapacity to form 
intent. At age fourteen, children were presumed to be capable of forming intent. Many 
states follow some updated form of the common law. All jurisdictions now have juvenile 
courts and special laws for juveniles.  Juveniles over a certain age who commit serious 
crimes can be tried in criminal courts as adults. 
 
Duress can be an excuse when individuals are threatened and forced to commit a crime or 
be killed. In most states, duress is not a defense to murder.  
 
At common law, and in most states, voluntary intoxication was not a defense. While 
voluntary intoxication is not an excuse, involuntary intoxication is a defense. 
 
Entrapment occurs when law enforcement officers actively induce, trick, or persuade 
individuals to commit crimes they otherwise wouldn’t commit. There are two main types 
of entrapment defenses. The subjective version focuses on whether or not the defendant 
was predisposed to commit the crime anyway. The objective version focuses on whether 
the government action would cause a reasonable, law-abiding person to commit a crime. 
 
Various types of syndromes or conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and 
premenstrual syndrome (PMS), have been offered as defenses.  In these instances, the 
defendant argues that he/she suffers from a syndrome that caused him or her to commit a 
crime.  The presumption being that if the syndrome wasn’t present, the crime would not 
have been committed. In general, syndrome defenses are not successful.   
 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS   
 
1. Discuss how being insane is different than a mental disease or defect.  Provide 
several examples. Do you think people who are insane should be held responsible 
for the crimes they commit?  What about people with a mental defect? LO2, LO3 
  
2. Research the juvenile laws in your state.  Discuss how juveniles are prosecuted 
and handled in the juvenile system, and when they might be transferred into adult 
court. Do you agree with the current laws in your state?  At what age do you 
believe it is acceptable for juveniles to be tried as adults?  Does the nature of the 
crime influence your opinion? LO11

3. Discuss the four elements of duress.  Do you think the threat needs to be real or 
perceived in order to qualify as a defense to a crime? How immediate does the 
threat need to be in order to be a reasonable defense?  LO13

Discuss the evolution of the excuse defense of age. 
 
At common law, children under the age of seven could not be criminally liable.   
Children who were between seven and fourteen years old were presumed to be 
too young to be criminally liable.  The state could put forth evidence to rebut that 
presumption.  Fourteen year olds were treated as adults.  States now vary in the 
age of criminal capacity, and often the separate issue of court jurisdiction gets 
blended with the issue of when a child can have the capacity to commit a crime.  
They are separate questions.  States vary as to the minimum age for capacity, and 
some states set no minimum age.  The juvenile court/ adult court issue resolves 
where the proceeding will be held assuming that the child could have criminal 
capacity.  LO 11

How does the Model Penal Code’s substantial capacity test differ from the 
M’Naghten test of insanity?  
 
The M’Naghten test of insanity (also known as the Right/Wrong test) states that a 
person is not guilty of a criminal act when, because of a mental disease or defect, 
he does not know the nature and quality of his actions or that what he was doing 
was wrong.  There is some variations by states which have adopted this test as to 
whether “wrong” means legally wrong or morally wrong and whether “know” 
means to be simply aware (cognition) or whether it requires an appreciation of 
the significance of the action.  The Model Penal Code’s test was an effort to deal 
with the criticisms of the right/wrong test and the irresistible impulse test.  Under 
this test, a defendant will not be guilty of a crime when because of a mental 
disease or defect he lacks a substantial capacity (not complete mental capacity) to 
either appreciate the criminality (grasp the significance that the act is wrongful) 
or to conform his behavior to the requirements of law (volitional aspect).  In sum, 
the MPC test combines the right and wrong test with the irresistible impulse test 
and clears up some definitional issues. LO 5, 6, 7, 8 
 
3. 
Compare and contrast the insanity and diminished capacity defenses.  
 
Insanity is a legal term and is an affirmative defense based upon mental disease 
or defect which affects the defendant’s ability to either know or control his 
behavior.  If successful, a plea of insanity may result in a civil commitment of an 
offender rather than incarceration.  Some states, however, use a guilty but 
mentally ill finding which nevertheless results in criminal liability for the 
defendant.  The trend has been to shift the burden of production and persuasion to 
the defendant as to whether he was insane at the time of the offense.  The defense 
of diminished capacity is not a complete defense and is most frequently limited to 
cases of homicide.  When successful, the diminished capacity defense will mitigate 
the level of the crime, but not result in a not guilty verdict.  So, for example, when 
charged with a first-degree murder, the offender may raise the excuse of 
diminished capacity (challenging the state’s ability to prove the requisite mens 
rea of intentional, purposeful behavior) which would still result in a conviction 
for second degree murder or manslaughter (depending on state law’s definitions 
of those crimes).   Many states have abolished a diminished capacity defense, or 
when they allow it, allow the evidence as a factor in sentencing.  LO 9, 10 
 
4.  
Discuss the two major approaches to the entrapment defense. 
 
The two main approaches to entrapment are the subjective test of entrapment 
which focuses on the predisposition of the defendant to commit the crime and the 
objective test of entrapment which focuses on the government’s behavior.  The 
subjective test of entrapment is employed by most of the states and all federal 
courts.  In order to successfully raise this defense, the defendant has to prove that 
the government pressured him or her to commit crimes they would not have 
committed without the pressure (lack of predisposition).  The subjective test

focuses on where the criminal intent originated.  If it originated with the 
defendant, there is no entrapment.    Examples of cases in which the subjective 
test was used are: Sherman v. U.S, Oliver v. State, and DePasquale v. State.  The 
Oliver case is a rare example of a successful use of the entrapment defense.    
 
The minor approach is the objective test of entrapment.  It is directed at unsavory 
police methods.  If the intent originates with the government and their actions 
would tempt an ordinary law-abiding person to commit the crime, the court 
should dismiss the case even if this particular defendant was predisposed to 
commit the crime.  The test is “objective” because it focuses on a reasonable law 
abiding citizen and the government’s inducements…not the inclinations of the 
defendant in the case at hand.  LO 14 
 
5.  
Compare and contrast the excuses of involuntary and voluntary intoxication. 
 
Generally, the excuse of involuntary intoxication is a complete defense whereas 
the excuse of voluntary intoxication, which is rarely allowed, acts only to lower 
the mens rea element and results in conviction on a lesser crime.  Involuntary 
intoxication applies to those cases where an individual unwittingly and 
unwillingly consumes an intoxicating substance (alcohol, controlled substances, 
or any other type of substance which may result in an adverse physical reaction).  
The classic example is when someone slips something into the drink of another.  
Involuntary intoxication defense is not successful when the person voluntarily 
consumes the intoxicant but has a much different or greater reaction than 
anticipated.  For example, if a person smoked marijuana to get high not knowing 
that it was laced with LSD which prompted a violent episode, they probably 
would not be able to successfully claim involuntary intoxication.  Voluntary 
intoxication, when permitted by statute, allows a defendant to claim that he was 
too intoxicated to form the requisite mens rea of purposeful or knowing behavior.  
It may result in a conviction for a crime of recklessness or negligence, but it is not 
a complete defense.  Moreover, even when statutes allow defendants to raise the

Parties to Crime and Vicarious Liability 
 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. To understand the different parties to crime and appreciate the difference between 
complicity and vicarious liability.   
2. To appreciate that participants before and during the commission of crimes are 
guilty of the crime itself. 
3. To understand that participants after the commission of crimes are guilty of a 
separate, less serious offense.  
4. To understand the difference between accomplice liability and conspiracy. 
5. To know that mere presence or inaction isn’t enough to establish accomplice 
actus reus; the defendant had to take some positive act to aid the commission of 
the offenses.    
6. To appreciate the courts are divided over whether knowledge is sufficient to prove 
accomplice mens rea.  
7. To understand that the core idea of accessory liability is that it’s not as 
blameworthy to help someone else escape prosecution and punishment as it is to 
participate in the crime itself. 
 
8. To know the definition of vicarious liability. 
9. To understand that vicarious liability can apply either to enterprise (mainly 
business) or to individuals. 
 
10. To know that vicarious liability has to be created by statute.

CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. There are two types of liability for someone else’s criminal act. (LO1)  
A. Complicity—Parties-to-crime laws establish when a person can be held liable 
for the crimes of another. 
B. Vicarious liability laws establish which types of relationships can create 
criminal liability. 
 
II. Parties to Crime (LO1)  
 
A. There were four types of parties to crime at common law: 
 
 
1. Principals in the first degree actually commit the crime.

a. Help before the crime is committed 
 
 
 
b. Are not present when the crime is committed 
 
 
4. Accessories-after-the-fact help after the crime is committed. 
B. Distinction important because at common law, the accomplices could not be 
prosecuted until the principal in the first degree was convicted  
1. All felonies were capital offenses (thus very serious penalty for 
someone who may not be quite so involved) 
 
C. As capital crimes decreased, the nature of accomplice liability was streamlined. 
D. Complicity –establishes when you can be criminally liable for someone else’s 
conduct 
E. Vicarious liability – establishes when a party can be criminally liable because 
of a relationship. 
F. Agency theory – assumes we’re all autonomous agents with the freedom to 
choose our own actions 
G. Forfeited personal identity theory – when you choose to commit a crime, 
youforfeit your right to be treated as an individual.      
 
III. Participation before and during the commission of a crime—Accomplices are 
prosecuted for committing the crime itself (helping a murderer is murder). (LO2, 3, 
4)

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
A person can be criminally liable for the criminal acts of another. The doctrine of 
complicity (parties to crime) establishes when you can be held criminally liable for 
someone else’s crimes. The doctrine of vicarious liability establishes what types of 
relationships can make you liable for someone else’s crimes.  Agency theory makes the 
assumption that we all choose our actions freely.  Forfeited personal identity theory is the 
idea that when we choose to participate in a crime, we forfeit our right to be treated as 
individuals.    
 
The common law on complicity was complex. A principal in the first degree was the 
person who actually committed the crime. Principals in the second degree were those 
who were present at the scene of the crime and aided the principal in the first degree. 
Such aid could take the form of being a lookout or driving the getaway car. Accessories-
before-the-fact were those who were involved in the crime before it was committed and 
were not present when it was committed. An example would be a person who provides 
safe-cracking tools for the safecracker. Finally, an accessory-after-the-fact is one whose 
only aid comes after the crime was completed. 
 
Today, the law has been simplified. Under the current approach participants before and 
during the commission of crimes are guilty of the crime itself. These persons are liable as 
accomplices. Participants after the commission of crimes are guilty of a separate, less 
serious offense.  
 
Liability as an accomplice is different from liability as a co-conspirator. Persons in a 
conspiracy to commit a crime can also be liable for both the conspiracy and the crimes of 
other conspirators. This flows from the Pinkerton rule. The crime in conspiracy is the 
agreement to commit the other crime. 
 
The essence of accomplice actus reus is that the accomplice took some positive action to 
aid or assist in the commission of a crime which was actually committed by another. The 
mens rea of complicity varies depending on the jurisdiction. It may be purpose, 
knowledge, recklessness, or negligence.

The core idea of accessory liability is that it’s not as blameworthy to help someone else 
escape prosecution as it is to participate in the crime itself.  
 
Vicarious liability transfers the actus reus and mens rea of an individual to another 
person, or from a person or persons to an enterprise because of a relationship.  Most 
vicarious liability involves business relationships such as employer-employee or 
manager-corporation relationships.  However, it can also apply to other enterprises or 
between individuals.  Vicarious liability of corporations is based upon federal and state 
statutes and has become increasingly important in light of recent financial collapse of 
corporate giants such as Enron.  The court has used the doctrine of respondeat superior to 
extend vicarious liability to the corporations.   
 
Individual vicarious liability involves making an individual responsible for the acts of 
other individuals: for instance, making owners of cars vicariously liable for operators’ 
parking tickets. The liability is created because of the owner-operator relationship. 
Vicarious liability of parents based on the parent-child relationship grew out of public 
fear, frustration, and anger over juvenile crime. There is little case law on such statutes 
and some have been held unconstitutional.

Discuss the four parties to a crime under the common law. 
 
At common law there were very specific laws of complicity.  Because all felonies 
were capital offenses at common law, in order to prosecute individuals who 
helped in the commission of a crime, the main actor had to first be convicted.  At 
common law, parties to a crime were either 1) a principal in the first degree (the 
person who committed the crime), 2) a principal in the second degree (person 
who was present when the crime was committed and helped commit it), 3) an 
accessory before the fact (persons not present when the crimes were committed 
but who helped beforehand), and 4) an accessory after the fact (persons who 
helped after the crime was committed).  LO 1, 2

2.   
How are accomplices different than co-conspirators?  
 
Both accomplice and conspiracy liability are based on the involvement of more 
than one person in a crime.  Accomplices are individuals who aid another in the 
commission of a crime. Accomplice mens rea is a little murky, some states require 
the specific purpose of aiding the other and the purpose that the other commit the 
crime but other states require only knowingly helping someone, and do not 
require the intent that they commit the crime.  See U.S. v. Peoni and Backum v. 
U.S.  
 
Conspiracy on the other hand is the act of agreeing with another to commit a 
crime.  The conspiracy mens rea is generally (see chapter eight) the specific 
intent to commit the criminal objective. A conspiracy can exist regardless of 
whether the agreed to crime is ever committed (some states require some overt 
act in furtherance of the criminal enterprise).   
 
Accomplice liability requires the completion of the crime.  Additionally, a person 
can render aid to another with the intent that they commit a crime—even without 
forming an agreement to do so (though this is a situation which is difficult to 
envision)  LO 1, 2, 3 
 
3.  
Define, compare, and contrast accomplice and vicarious liability.   
 
Accomplice liability and vicarious liability both stem from the area of law dealing 
with who can be a party to a crime.  Accomplice liability is based upon the 
actions and intentions of a person who either directly engages in the crime or 
helps another to commit a crime.  Accessory after the fact is a part of the 
discussion of accomplice liability, and specifically targets those individuals who 
are directly responsible for helping another after the commission of a crime.  The 
actus reus and mens rea of accomplice liability is personal to the actor.  For 
example, when an individual did something and had some criminal intent. 
 
Vicarious liability, on the other hand, involves holding persons (and 
corporations) responsible for the actions of others.  The person being held 
responsible did not commit any act nor did they have any guilty mind, but because 
of their relationship to the actor, a policy decision was made to hold them 
responsible.  Regarding corporate liability, a corporation can be held guilty of 
the crimes of its agents, so the actus reus and mens rea of the president, etc is 
transferred to the corporation.  Individual vicarious liability occurs in the same 
way.  An owner of a business who committed no voluntary act nor had any 
criminal intent can nevertheless be held responsible for the acts of his or her 
employee because of the employer-employee relationship. 
 
Accomplice liability is based upon personal blameworthiness and therefore 
punishing aiders and abettors is seen as a justified societal response.  Vicarious 
liability imposes criminal blameworthiness upon individuals who have not done

anything blameworthy, and so it is more difficult to justify but will be imposed 
when statutes are clear that they intend to be vicarious liability statutes.  LO 1,4,5 
 
4. 
How does the government use vicarious liability to combat corporate crime? 
 
Historically, the government has taken a hands-off approach to regulating 
corporations, relying instead on the marketplace, corporate self-discipline, and 
the pressure of the business community to cause corporations to act responsibly 
and follow the law.  However, it has recently become quite clear that self-
regulation has not been working.  Blatant criminal acts by corporate agents for 
their own personal benefit and the benefit of the corporation have been exposed, 
and although Congress could be prescriptive in regulating corporate activity 
(based on the interstate commerce clause and the contracts clause), it has instead 
used vicarious liability and the doctrine of respondiat superior to seek criminal 
penalties for corporations for the acts of their officers.   This is seen in its 
prosecution of Arthur Anderson, LLP and Enron Corp.  LO 5 
 
5. 
What are the four elements of most accessory-after-the-fact statutes?  
 
Most accessory after the fact statutes have four elements: two mens rea elements, 
one actus reus element, and one circumstance element. The accessory after the 
fact personally aided the one who committed the crime, the accessory knew the 
felony was committed, the accessory aided the person who committed the crime 
for the purpose of hindering the prosecution of the person, and someone else 
committed the felony (not the accessory).  The cases of State v. Chism and State v. 
Ulvinen both highlight accessory after the fact liability.  The interesting twist in 
Ulvinen is that the mom’s behavior was classic “accessory after the fact” 
behavior. She personally aided her son, she knew he had killed his wife, she 
helped him dismember her son’s wife’s body so as to destroy the evidence, and 
she was not the person who committed the killing, but the statute excluded parents 
from the list of people who could be charged for being an accessory after the fact.

Chapter 8 
Inchoate Crimes 
 
 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. To understand that inchoate offenses punish people for crimes they’ve started to 
commit but haven’t finished committing.  
 
2. To appreciate the dilemma inchoate offenses present to free societies and know 
the three different ways the inchoate offenses are resolved.  
 
3. To understand that liability for criminal attempt offenses is based on two 
rationales: preventing dangerous conduct and neutralizing dangerous people. 
 
4. To know the mens rea of inchoate crimes is always the purpose or specific intent 
to commit a specific crime. 
 
5. To understand that the actus reus of attempt is an act that goes beyond mere 
preparation but not far enough to complete the crime. 
 
6. To understand that legal impossibility is a defense to attempt liability and that 
factual impossibility is not. 
 
7. To understand that voluntary and complete abandonment of an attempt in 
progress is a defense to attempt liability in about half the states.  
 
8. To understand that punishing conspiracy and solicitation to commit a crime is 
based on nipping in the bud the special danger of group criminality. 
 
9. To know the different types of conspiracies.  
 
10. To understand the Racketeer influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act 
and how it works against organized crime.  
 
11. To understand that punishing solicitation is based on the same idea as punishing 
conspiracy: to stop such crimes from happening before they start, anticipating the 
dangers of group criminality.

CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. Inchoate crimes are incomplete crimes.  (LO1, 2)  
A. Inchoate comes from the Latin “to begin.”  
B. Inchoate crimes are separate crimes of starting but not finishing any other crime. 
C. Whether to make it a crime to start but not finish committing the crime poses a  
 
problem:  
1. Is the law punishing someone who has done no harm or setting someone 
free who is determined to do harm?  
2. Dilemma of criminal attempt law is resolved through three 
requirements: 
 
 
 
a. Requiring specific intent 
 
 
 
b. Requiring some action 
 
 
 
c. Punishing inchoate crimes less severely than completed crimes 
 
D. Three types of inchoate offenses: 
 
 
1. Attempt—trying to commit a crime but failing to complete them 
 
 
2. Conspiracy—agreeing to commit a crime 
 
 
3. Solicitation—trying to get someone else to commit a crime 
 
E. All inchoate offenses are specific intent crimes.

II. Attempt—An attempt is a failed effort to complete a crime.  (LO3)  
 
A. Attempt History 
 
 
1. Began with “excessive leniency” 
2. In the 1500s and 1600s, modern attempt law began punishing attempts 
more seriously. 
3. By the 1800s, attempts to commit indictable offenses were 
misdemeanors. 
 
B. Rationales for criminal attempt law 
1. Dangerous act rationale—prevent harm from dangerous conduct 
(focuses on how close to completion the crime is) 
2. Dangerous person rationale—neutralize dangerous people (focuses on 
how developed the criminal purpose is) 
3. Both (1) and (2) look at actions taken to measure the danger. 
 
C. Elements of Attempt  (LO4,5)  
 
 
1.  Attempt mens rea  
 
 
 
a. Purpose or specific intent always present 
 
 
 
b. No knowing, reckless, or negligent attempts 
 
 
 
c. Case: People v. Kimball  
 
 
2.  Attempt actus reus  
 
 
 
a. How much action is enough?  
i. Preparation isn’t enough to qualify as the actus reus of 
attempt. 
ii. Toughest problem in criminal attempt is drawing a line 
between preparation and attempt. 
b. There are several tests employed by states—and they are not 
necessarily mutually exclusive.  Some are stricter than others 
(for example, the last proximate act rule is the strictest).  
 
c. Tests to help draw the line between preparation and the act of 
attempt:  
 
i.   Physical proximity test  
(a) Focus on  
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Dangerous conduct, not dangerous people 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) What’s left to do, not what’s already done 
(b) Completion of all but the last act needed to accomplish 
the crime is surely enough, but so are acts falling short 
of this point. 
ii.  Indispensable element test—defendants who’ve gotten 
control of everything they need to complete the crime  
iii. Dangerous proximity test (physical proximity test) —
defendants have gotten dangerously close to completing the 
crime 
iv.  Unequivocality (probable desistance) test—aka res ipsa 
loquiter tests (act speaks for itself) 
 
 
 
 
(a) Focus on dangerous persons, not dangerous conduct  
 
 
 
 
(b) Focus on what’s already done, not what’s left to do

(c) Unequivocality test asks whether an ordinary person 
observing defendants’ actions without knowing their 
intent would guess they were determined to commit the 
crime. 
(d) Case: State v. Stewart  
  
v. Probable desistance test 
(a) Dangerous person test that focuses on how far 
defendants have gotten, not what’s left to do to 
complete the crime 
(b) Defendant got far enough that it is unlikely they will 
turn back  
 
vi.  “Substantial steps” (Model Penal Code) test  
(a) Purpose—clarify and simplify other tests (proximity 
and unequivocality)  
(b) Distinguish more sharply between preparation and 
beginning to attempt to complete the crime 
(c) Base attempt law on neutralizing dangerous persons not 
just preventing dangerous conduct 
 
 
 
 
(d) Focus on dangerous persons  
 
 
 
 
(e) Focus on what’s already done, not what’s left to do  
(f) Definition—Substantial steps that “strongly 
corroborate” defendant's criminal purpose (list of things 
which “strongly corroborate”) 
(g) Case: Young v. State 
 
 
 
(h) Case: People v. Rizzo  
 
 
 
(i) Case: Commonwealth v. Peaslee  
 
D. Impossibility of completing the crime as a defense  (LO6) 
1. Legal impossibility is a defense to criminal attempt; factual 
impossibility is not. 
 
 
2. Legal impossibility  
a. Defendants intend to commit crimes, do everything they can to 
complete the crime, but what they intend and do isn’t a crime. 
b. It is a defense 
 
 
3. Factual impossibility  
a. Defendants intend to commit a crime and take all the steps 
necessary to complete it, but a fact makes it impossible to 
complete. 
b. People bent on committing crimes shouldn’t benefit from a 
stroke of luck—this isn’t a defense. 
4. Case: State v. Damms 
5. Case: State v. Robins  
6. Case: State v. Kordas  
 
E. Voluntary Abandonment of attempts as a defense  (LO7)  
1. Complete and voluntary abandonment of attempt is an affirmative 
defense in about half the states.

2. Arguments in favor of the abandonment defense  
a. People who voluntarily and completely give up their criminal 
attempts aren’t dangerous. 
b. We want to encourage people who are just about to hurt 
someone or their property to give up their plans.

to take the early steps in committing crimes because they know they 
won’t be punished. 
4. Case: LeBarron v. State 
 
III. Conspiracy is an agreement to commit a crime.  (LO8)  
A. Agreeing to commit crimes (criminal conspiracy) is further removed from 
completed crimes than trying to commit them (criminal attempt).

2. Strikes at the special danger of group criminal activity  
 
C. Conspiracy actus reus  
 
 
1. Agreement to commit a crime is the heart of the crime of conspiracy. 
a. Doesn’t have to be in writing  
b. An unspoken understanding, inferred from facts and 
circumstances, is good enough to prove agreement.

2. About half the states require an “overt act” in addition to the act of 
agreement. 
a. Purpose—verify the firmness of the agreement  
b. Act doesn’t have to amount to much; it can be of “very small 
significance” 
c. Case: U.S. v. Garcia

2. Can mean intent to make the agreement or intent to achieve the criminal 
objective. 
 
E. Circumstance – if any required by statute  
 
F. Causation plus bad result equals the result to crime  
 
G..Parties to conspiracy  
1. Traditional approach—two or more individuals agreeing to commit

in some jurisdictions to including all crimes in other jurisdictions.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 

Inchoate offenses involve punishing people for crimes they haven’t completed. The term 
“inchoate” comes from the Latin meaning “to begin.” Inchoate offenses require some 
action but not enough to finish the crime intended. Such offenses enable the police, 
courts, and corrections to intervene before the intended harm occurs. All of these offenses 
have both a general intent and a specific intent element. General intent is to do the act, 
say the words, make an agreement, etc.  Specific intent is any intent other than general 
intent. In these crimes, the specific intent is to commit a crime above and beyond the 
inchoate offense. Inchoate crimes are generally punished separately and less severely 
than the completed offense. 
 
Criminal liability for criminal attempt offenses is based on two rationales—first, 
preventing dangerous conduct, and second, neutralizing dangerous people. The mens rea 
of inchoate crimes is the specific intent to commit a complete crime. 
 
The actus reus of attempt is an action that is beyond mere preparation but not actual 
completion of the crime. How much action is required to make one guilty of an attempt is 
hotly debated, and there are a number of approaches. A proximity approach focuses on 
how close the defendant gets to completing the crime. An unequivocality approach 
focuses on whether the defendant got far enough along that stopping is unlikely. The 
Model Penal Code test requires that the defendant has taken substantial steps and that 
such steps strongly corroborate the actor’s criminal intent. 
 
Legal impossibility is a defense to attempt liability. If the defendant did everything he or 
she wanted to do and it still wouldn’t be a crime, then it is a valid defense. The principle 
of legality would seem to require this. Factual impossibility is not a defense. If certain 
factors unknown to the defendant would make it impossible to complete the crime, this is 
not a defense. In some jurisdictions voluntary and complete abandonment of an attempt 
in progress may be a defense to attempt liability.  
 
Solicitation and conspiracy both involve more than one person. Punishing conspiracy and 
solicitation to commit a crime is based not only on preventing crime but also on the 
special danger of group criminality. 
 
Criminal conspiracy is the crime of agreeing with one or more people to commit a crime. 
The actus reus of conspiracy is the agreement. Some jurisdictions also require that one of 
the co-conspirators commit some overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy. Conspiracy is 
a specific intent crime. In addition to intending to agree (general intent), they must also 
intend to commit the planned crime. 
 
The traditional approach to conspiracy required that at least two people really and 
sincerely agree to commit a crime (bilateral approach). Under this approach, a person 
could not be guilty of conspiring with an undercover police officer that had no intent to 
agree or carry out a crime. Under the unilateral approach, there can be a conspiracy even 
though another party does not truly agree and doesn’t even know some of the others 
involved.

Racketeering and corrupt organizations act (RICO)   
Definition - imposes enhanced penalties for “all types of organized criminal behavior, 
that is, enterprise criminality – from simple political to sophisticated white collar 
schemes to traditional Mafia-type endeavors.”  Publicized by President Johnson in 1967 
and signed into law by President Nixon.  Originally referred to as the extortion of money 
or advantage by threat or force. Expanded meaning today to include a pattern of illegal 
activity.  Enterprise – just about any form of human endeavor.  RICO allows prosecutors 
to combine a pattern of crimes from any state and then charge and prosecute as one 
crime. 
 
Criminal solicitation is the crime of trying to get one or more persons to commit a crime. 
The actus reus is a solicitation, command, or encouragement to commit a crime. In 
addition to a general intent to ask or command, there must be a specific intent that the 
solicited crime be completed.

Essay  
 
1. 
Compare and contrast conspiracy, attempt and solicitation.  
 
Conspiracy, attempt and solicitation are all inchoate (meaning incomplete) 
offenses. They are similar in that the mens rea attached for each is purposeful.  
The persons involved have to have the specific intent to commit the crime or cause 
the harm. Generally, there has to be some (overt) action on the part of the actors 
which indicates or manifests the true intent to commit the crime. These crimes 
differ in their actus reus components. For attempt, there is a variety of 
approaches determining when the criminal act has been satisfied (see question 
two).  For conspiracy, the actus reus involves entering an agreement to commit a 
crime.  And for solicitation, the actus reus involves requesting, soliciting, asking 
another to commit another crime.  Other ways in which the crimes are different 
concerns whether the inchoate crime folds into the intended crime (called 
merger).  With conspiracy, the agreement to commit the other crime is separate

from the other crime (no merger—Pinkerton rule); with solicitation there is also a 
separate crime; with attempt, however, if the person completes the underlying 
crime, they are usually not charged with both the attempt and the completed 
crime.   LO 1, 4, 5, 8 
 
2. 
Discuss the various approaches to the actus reus of attempt. Provide an example 
of each.  
 
 
 
The approaches to the actus reus requirement of attempt highlight two rationales 
about why we punish people who haven’t completed the crime: because they 
commit dangerous acts, or because they are dangerous individuals.  The 
dangerous act rational tries to prevent the harm from the dangerous conduct, so it 
focuses on how close the person got to completing the underlying crime.  The 
approaches which fall into this category are proximity tests, including the 
physical proximity test, the dangerous proximity test, and the indispensible 
element test. The physical proximity/dangerous proximity to success tests ask 
whether defendants have come dangerously close to completing their crimes. The 
indispensible element test focuses on whether the actor has gathered everything 
they need to complete the crime.  Other states have been more concerned with 
attempts reflecting dangerous people. Three tests that have grown out of the 
dangerous person rationale are the unequivocality test (res ipsa loquiter), the 
probable desistance test,  and the substantial steps test (found in the MPC).  The 
unequivocality tests asks whether an ordinary person who saw the acts without 
knowing the actors intent would conclude the actor was determined to commit a 
crime.  This is also know as the stop film test.  The probable desistence test 
focuses on how far defendants have gone and whether it is unlikely that they will 
turn back.  Finally, the substantial steps test adopted by the MPC looks at 
whether there were substantial steps (ones which strongly corroborate the actor’s 
purpose) taken toward completing the crime.  All approaches tend to distinguish 
between mere preparation (not attempt) and the beginning of the attempt.  Some 
states have preparation statutes which criminalize the acts of preparation. LO 5 
 
3. 
Identify, compare and contrast the defenses to attempt liability.  
 
There are two defenses to attempt liability: legal impossibility and voluntary 
abandonment.  In any discussion of impossibility as a defense to a criminal 
attempt, the distinction between a factual impossibility (which is not a defense) 
and a legal impossibility (which is a defense) will be addressed.  Factual 
impossibility exists when, if the facts were as the defendant believed them to be, 
the crime would have been committed.  So, for example, if John goes to the 
hospital and enters Bob’s room thinking Bob is asleep and shoots Bob intending 
to kill him, the crime would be criminal homicide if things were as John expected 
(an alive Bob who he shot and mortally wounded).  If, however, moments before 
the shot and unbeknownst to John, Bob had died from the injuries which put him 
in the hospital, John will not be able to raise impossibility as a defense, and he 
should be convicted of attempted murder.  If things were as he believed, he would

have killed Bob.  Legal impossibility is a defense to attempt, and is seen in the 
following example.  Ruth believes it against the law to bring a certain type of 
cheese into the USA when she travels from Switzerland to visit her son.  There is, 
however, no law prohibiting the importation of this cheese.  So, even though she 
intends to commit cheese smuggling, if prosecuted, she will successfully raise the 
impossibility defense.  It is legally impossible to commit the offense, even if 
everything was as she believed it to be.  [Think about how impractical it would be 
for prosecutors to try to prosecute individuals for crimes that do not exist.]  The 
State v. Damms case, however, shows how blurry the lines between factual and 
legal impossibility are.  LO 6 
 
The second defense to attempt is voluntary abandonment.  In states which provide 
for this defense, an individual who has a true change of heart and willfully and 
voluntarily desists from his criminal plan can successfully defend against 
prosecution for attempt.  The rationale is that such a person no longer presents a 
threat, and should be able to evade criminal liability.  The issues generally 
surround whether the change of heart was sincere, stemming from the defendant 
himself, or whether it was prompted by an extraneous factor.  The case of 
LeBarron shows that changes of heart prompted by extraneous factors do not 
qualify as voluntary abandonment (also known as renunciation).   LO 7 
 
4. 
Discuss the evolution of conspiracy law. How have these changes dealt with 
modern, large-scale conspiracies? 
 
Conspiracy law involves two or more individuals agreeing to commit a crime.  
Both at common law and under modern statutes, there is some murkiness as to the 
required mens rea.  Yes, as indicated above, all inchoate crimes have purposeful 
as their mens rea, but what is sometimes unclear is whether the individuals must 
specifically intend to agree or whether they must specifically intend to commit the 
crime (attain a specific criminal objective).  Also unclear is whether a conspiracy 
exists when there is a difference of opinion as to the ultimate objective.  Under 
modern law, most states have adopted the unilateral approach, so as long as one 
of the participants really intended to go through with the crime, it is still 
conspiracy—even though the other secretly did not intend to go through with it.  
Modern large-scale conspiracies are either wheel conspiracies (in which one or 
more individuals participate in every transaction—the hub of the conspiracy) or 
chain conspiracies (where participants at one end of the transaction have no 
connection with others at the other end of the transaction—for example, in a 
complex illegal drug trade operation). Conspiracy law generally holds that one 
co-conspirator is liable for all other acts of all other co-conspirators so long as 
they were committed during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  
This has far reaching implications for individuals involved with large-scale 
conspiracies:  A Maine street dealer of methamphetamine would be liable for a 
murder committed in Mexico by someone transporting precursor drugs to a 
superlab. LO 4, 8

5. 
Compare and contrast the unilateral and bilateral approach to conspiracy. 
 
Traditionally, two or more parties to a conspiracy had to have a meeting of minds 
as to the agreement.  So, if a defendant agreed with an undercover officer to sell 
cocaine for money there would not be a conspiracy because the undercover 
officer’s intent was not really to buy the cocaine (the crime of possession of 
cocaine) but rather to apprehend the other.  This was called the bilateral 
approach.  Under modern law, most states have adopted the unilateral approach, 
and so as long as one of the participants really intended to go through with the 
crime, it is still conspiracy—even though the other secretly did not intend to go 
through with it. LO 8

 Crimes Against Persons I: Murder and Manslaughter 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. To understand that criminal homicide is different from all other crimes because of 
the finality of its result: the death of the victim. 
2. To appreciate that most of the law regarding criminal homicide is about grading 
the seriousness of the offense.  Grading murder into first and second degree is 
important because only first-degree murder qualify for the death penalty.  
3. To appreciate that the meaning of “person” is integral to homicide law and 
understand how that presents problems at both ends of the life cycle. 
4. To understand how degrees of murder developed through history and their 
relation to capital punishment.

corporations, but prosecutions are rare. 
9. To understand that the heart of voluntary manslaughter is an intentional, sudden

malice aforethought.   
a. Express malice aforethought: fits original meaning of murder—
intentional killings planned in advance 
2. Historically, the concept of “malice aforethought” was expanded to 
include implied malice. It consisted of five mental states—the specific

a. Kill another person (express malice aforethought)  
 
 
 
b. Seriously injure another person

person (live human being). Defining the beginning and end of life is 
controversial and differs among jurisdictions (some include fetal 
murder and brain death).

6. Criminal harm resulting in the death of another  
C. The Kinds and Degrees of Murder—Murder is the most serious form of 
criminal homicide.  (LO6)  
1.  Originally murder was never divided into degrees and all murders were 
capital offenses. 
2.  Dividing murder into degrees was a product of not wishing to execute 
all persons convicted of criminal homicide, following the tradition of 
letting judges mitigate penalties by use of “benefit of clergy.” 
3. Many statutes followed the same common-law scheme in dividing up   
premeditated and felony murder. 
4.  The Model Penal code doesn’t use the degrees, but does divide murder 
according to mental attitude. 
5. Today, most jurisdictions have two degrees of homicide (some have 
three). 
D. First-degree Murder 
1. Death Penalty—Discretionary in all states authorizing the death penalty 
 
 
 
a. Highly complex 
 
 
 
b. Several constitutional limitations 
 
 
 
 
i. Mandatory death sentences are banned. 
ii. Unguided discretionary death penalty sentences are 
banned. 
 
 
 
 
iii. Mitigating factors are required. 
 
 
 
 
iv. Additional aggravating factors are allowed. 
c. Most states have adopted MPC’s recommendation of bifurcation 
and a criterion for decision. 
2.  First-degree murder mens rea (a capital offense in states with the death 
penalty) 
 
 
 
a. Premeditated, deliberate killings  
 
 
 
b. Atrocious, brutal, or cruel murders (in capital cases) 
 
 
 
c. Specific-intent-plus-real-premeditation-deliberation definition 
 
 
 
d. Equivalent-of-specific-intent definition 
 
 
 
e. Cases: Commonwealth v. Drum 
 
 
 
f. Case: Byford v. State 
 
 
 
g. Case: State v. Snowden 
 
 
3. First-degree murder actus reus 
 
 
 
a. Generally the manner of killing doesn’t matter. 
 
 
 
b. Manner could be critical if it could be a capital offense. 
c. Some states have statutes making heinous, atrocious, and cruel 
first-degree murder capital offenses. 
d. Case: Duest v. State 
 
 
 
e. Case: Commonwealth v. Golston 
 
E. Second-degree murder   
1. Divide murder for purposes of determining capital and non-capital 
punishment. 
2. Divide between intentional and unintentional murder—second-degree 
murders are unintentional murders.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Criminal homicides are different from all other crimes because of the finality of the 
result—the death of the victim.  Because of the seriousness of the harm, and the penalty, 
this is probably the most complex area of substantive criminal law. Although the 
definitions vary from state to state, there are many common principles. All criminal 
homicides involve the killing of another person. The mens rea can include knowingly, 
intentionally, purposely, recklessly, and negligently. The mens rea must trigger the act, 
and the act must cause the death. The causation element has two components: cause in 
fact and legal cause.

The law of homicide has its origins in the common law. Early on, there were only three 
types of homicide: justifiable, excusable, and criminal. A justifiable murder was not 
punishable if the defendant could establish a justification such as self-defense. An 
excusable murder was not criminal if the defendant could establish an excuse such as an 
accident. 
 
Murder was defined as killing with malice aforethought. The crime of murder was 
expanded by creating implied malice situations, such as the depraved-heart and felony 
murder. The common law also created the crime of voluntary manslaughter, which 
involved an intentional killing during the heat of passion. 
 
The actus reus of criminal homicide is killing another person. Today, in many 
jurisdictions, a fetus can be the victim of a criminal homicide. Advances in medical 
science have changed the definition of death. Brain death qualifies as death even though 
the person may be able to continue breathing.  Assisted suicide has always presented a 
dilemma, and euthanasia can take many forms.  Doctor-assisted suicide is controversial, 
and those opposing it argue that it is intrinsically immoral and flaunts the sanctity of 
human life.  Additionally, they argue that there is a slippery slope and that allowing 
mercy killings leads to allowing non-mercy killings.  Those in favor of doctor-assisted 
suicide aren’t necessarily in favor of death, but rather oppose pain and advocate for 
personal autonomy. Without some justification, doctor-assisted suicide is first-degree 
murder.  The Court in Gonzales v. Oregon upheld Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act and 
thus provided the justification which prevents doctors from being prosecuted for 
rendering assistance to those who wish to terminate their lives—under very specific 
circumstances.  
 
Emotion-act distinction is separating the emotions that led to a killing from the question 
of whether it was reasonable.  Act reasonableness means “a finding that a reasonable 
person in the defendant’s shoes would have responded as violently as the defendant did.”  
Emotional reasonableness is a finding that “the defendant’s emotional outrage or passion 
was reasonable. 
 
The mens rea of criminal homicide is typically intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or 
negligently (criminal negligence). There are, however, other types of murders. For 
instance, the intent to commit a qualifying felony substitutes for the intent to kill in 
felony murder. Many states have limited the felony murder doctrine to violent or 
dangerous felonies 
 
Most of the law of criminal homicide is about grading the offense according to the 
elements of mens rea, actus reus, or mitigating or aggravating circumstances. The 
common law did not recognize degrees of murder. Pennsylvania was the first state to 
divide murder into two degrees. Most states have four basic types of murder: first-degree 
murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. 
Grading murder into first- and second-degree is important because in some states only 
first-degree (or capital) murders qualify for the death penalty (or prison for life without

parole in states without the death penalty). Second-degree murder is typically an 
unpremeditated but intentional killing. 
 
Most murder statutes apply to corporations. However, in most cases, liability doesn’t 
extend beyond the rare prosecution for involuntary manslaughter in outrageous cases. 
Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional, sudden killing triggered by an adequate 
provocation.  
 
Provocation isn’t an excuse for criminal homicide; it only reduces the punishment to 
allow for human weaknesses. Most jurisdictions have both objective and subjective 
requirements for the elements of voluntary manslaughter. Only certain types of 
provocation are deemed legally adequate. Usually, these are mutual combat, assault and 
battery, trespass, and adultery. Words alone are, in many states, not deemed an adequate 
provocation. However, in other states following the “last-straw rule,” words may be 
sufficient provocation. Catching a spouse in the act of adultery is generally recognized as 
an adequate provocation. Further, the killer must not have cooled off from the sudden 
passion. If the killer did cool off, it is an intentional murder and not a voluntary 
manslaughter. Specifically, the elements of voluntary manslaughter are as follows. The 
actus reus is killing of another person. The mens rea is intent to kill or inflict serious 
bodily injury. The circumstances are sudden heat of passion flowing from an adequate 
provocation (or honest but unreasonable belief that killing was necessary in self-defense). 
The acts must cause the death of another. 
 
Involuntary manslaughter is the least blameworthy form of criminal homicide. It involves 
unintentional (reckless or negligent) killing. Recklessness involves conscious creation of 
a serous and unjustifiable risk. Negligence involves unknowing creation of a substantial 
and unjustifiable risk.

Compare and contrast first-degree murder and second-degree murder.  
 
Grading murder into first- and second- degree is a relatively modern approach.   
Because the harm in murder is always the same (death of the victim), often the 
grade of murder is based on the mens rea of the actor and the manner in which 
the murder was committed.  First-degree murder is premeditated, deliberate, and 
willful intent-to-kill murders (and some states include felony murders).  Only first-
degree murders are eligible for the death penalty.  Much of the case law 
surrounding first-degree murder concerns whether the actions were deliberate, 
willful, premeditated.  (See, for example, Byford v. States.)  Sometimes the issue is 
whether the act was heinous, atrocious or particularly cruel.  If so, the murder

warrant the death penalty but involve “implied malice” such as felony murder, 
depraved heard murder, intent-to-inflict-serious bodily injury murder.  Other 
states have specific depraved heard second-degree murder statutes.  Felony 
murders fall into either first-degree or second-degree murder statutes depending 
on the state. LO 2 
 
2. 
Describe the felony murder rule.  
The felony murder rule makes accidental deaths that occur during the commission 
of a felony either a first degree or second degree murder (depending on the state).  
When an individual is killed during the course of “an inherently dangerous” 
felony, or a felony listed in the statute, it does not matter that the criminal did not 
intend to cause the death of the victim. It suffices that the person intended to 
commit the underlying felony.  One issue surrounding the felony murder rules is 
when a co-defendant is killed during the course of the felony.  In People v. 
Hudson, the court upheld the defendant’s felony murder conviction when a police 
officer shot and killed the codefendant.  The parties argued the issue of causation 
and foreseeability at the appellate level and the majority found that Hudson was 
the proximate cause of the death of his partner.  The other issue that arises in 
felony murder is the meaning of “inherently dangerous felony.”  In California, 
the courts say that the underlying felony should be looked at “in the abstract” 
(meaning not paying attention to the facts of the given case), and found that a 
doctor could not be guilty of felony murder when the underlying felony was fraud.  
Other states adopt a case by case approach and look at whether the acts in the 
case were dangerous.  (This is similar to the foreseeability examination in 
Hudson. If the felony was committed in a dangerous way, then the death is more 
foreseeable.) LO 2, 4 
3. 
Compare and contrast voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.  
 
 Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing done during the “heat of 
passion” in response to adequate and legally recognized provocation, without 
time to cool off.  Involuntary manslaughter is unintentional killing done in a 
reckless or negligent way or during the course of an unlawful act (misdemeanor 
manslaughter).   The difference between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter 
rests with the mens rea element, and the intent to kill is the key.  The reason 
voluntary manslaughter is not murder is because of the recognition that on 
occasion people cannot control themselves, and it would be unjust to subject them 
to the penalties of first degree murder in light of the provocation they are 
responding too.  The reason that involuntary manslaughter is considered a crime 
and not just an accident has to do with the recklessness or negligence of the 
individual.  It would be bad policy to let people who create substantial and 
unjustifiable risks of harm to not suffer any punishment when their behavior 
causes the death of another. LO 6, 7, 8 and 9

4. 
Compare and contrast justifiable, excusable, and criminal homicide.  
Killing another person is homicide, and it becomes criminal homicide when there 
is no excuse or justification for the killing.  Earlier in the text you examined 
justification defenses. Included among those were self defense, defense of others, 
choice of evils (necessity), and execution of public duties.  One example that 
highlights the difference between criminal homicide and justifiable homicide is to 
examine the death penalty.  When a person is put to death as a result of their 
crime, the state sets a time and place for the execution, prisoners are given a 
“last meal” etc.  There is no way to argue that this is not the premeditated, 
deliberate, and willful killing of another, but it is not murder, and the prosecutor 
does not file charges against the executioner.  Why? Because the action is 
justified.  Likewise, excusable homicides are killing done with an excuse defense 
(insanity, age, involuntary intoxication, syndrome defenses).  If, for example, a 
person was given a sedative in their soda pop and had an adverse reaction and 
ran over a crowd of young children on the playground, he or she would not be 
guilty of criminal homicide if they were able to show that their intoxication was 
involuntary and unknown to them.  It would be wrong to hold them responsible 
for the deaths if they had no culpability other than drinking a soda pop.  Criminal 
homicides are killings for which it is appropriate for society to express its 
condemnation. LO 1 
5. 
 Discuss the concept of express and implied malice aforethought as it applies to 
common law murder. 
 
At common law, the earliest definitions of criminal homicide involved that the 
killing be done with malice aforethought.  This meant that in order for the crime 
to be murder it had to be an intentional killing planned in advance.  As common 
law developed, judges added additional types of killing to the definition of malice 
aforethought: intentional killings without premeditation or reasonable 
provocation; unintentional killings during the commission of felonies; depraved 
heart killings; intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.  The term express malice 
aforethought was reserved for the intentional killing planned in advance, but 
implied malice aforethought was found when the killing occurred in the other 
ways.  LO 4

CHAPTER OUTLINE 
 
I. Other than homicide, there are three kinds of crimes against persons—sexual, bodily 
injury, and restraint. (LO1)  
 
A. Sex offenses (e.g., rape) 
 
B. Bodily injury crimes (e.g., assault) 
 
C. Personal restraint crimes (e.g., kidnapping and false imprisonment) 
 
II. Sex Offenses—Forcible rape was an offense at common law but has been modified 
greatly since then. The criminal justice system has struggled in dealing with 
acquaintance rapes and sexual assaults against men. (LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4)   
 
A. The history of rape law  
 
 
1. Originally, only narrowly defined rape and sodomy  
a. Rape—Forced heterosexual vaginal penetration of a woman not 
married to the rapist  
 
 
 
b. Sodomy—Anal intercourse between males  
 
 
2. The elements of common-law rape  
 
 
 
a. Intentional vaginal intercourse  
 
 
 
b. Between a man and a woman not his wife  
 
 
 
c. Achieved by force or threat of serious bodily harm  
 
 
 
d. Without the woman’s consent  
3. Victims could testify against rapists, but the woman’s credibility 
depended on three conditions that were difficult (if not impossible) to 
prove:  
 
 
 
a. Her chastity  
 
 
 
b. Whether she reported the rape promptly  
 
 
 
c. Whether the rape was corroborated by other testimony  
 
B. Criminal Sexual Conduct Statutes (LO5)  
 
 
1. Rape and related sex offense law reforms (1970s–80s)  
 
 
 
a. Changes in prosecution procedures  
 
 
 
b. Abolished the corroboration rule  
 
 
 
c. Relaxed the prompt-reporting rule  
d. Banned introduction of evidence of the victim’s past sexual 
conduct through rape shield laws  
 
 
 
e. Changes in the definition of rape and related sex offenses  
(1) Marital rape exception (husbands can’t rape wives) 
abolished in some states

211 
 
 
 
 
2. Sexual offenses consolidated into one statute 
 
 
 
 
a. All nonconsensual sexual penetrations and contacts included 
 
 
 
 
b. Sex offenses made gender-neutral 
 
 
 
c. Seriousness of offense divided into several degrees, graded by 
 
 
 
 
(1) Penetration (more serious) and contact (less serious)  
 
 
 
 
(2) Use of force (more serious)  
 
 
 
 
(3) Physical injury aggravates crime  
 
 
 
 
(4) Gang rapes are more serious.  
 
C. The elements of modern rape law (LO6, LO7, LO8)  
 
 
1. Rape actus reus—Two parts  
 
 
 
a. Sexual penetration, however slight  
 
 
 
 
 
 
b. Force and resistance standard—focused on the woman’s consent  
(1) Utmost resistance standard (1600s–1950s)—Victims 
had to prove by resistance to the utmost that they didn’t 
consent 
(2) Reasonable resistance standard (1950s–70s)—Amount 
of required resistance depended on the circumstances of 
each case. 
(3) Many new statutes have dropped the resistance 
requirement.  
 
 
 
(a) Stranger rape, resistance isn’t really an issue 
 
 
 
(b) Acquaintance rape, resistance is critical 
 
 
(4) Case: Jones v. State 
 
 
 
c. By force or threat of force—Force  
(1) “Intrinsic” in some jurisdictions—Only the amount of 
physical exertion needed to achieve penetration in 
nonconsensual sex 
(2) “Extrinsic” in some jurisdictions—Some force in 
addition to the amount of exertion needed to achieve 
nonconsensual penetration 
 
(3) Case: Commonwealth v. Berkowitz 
 
 
(4) Case: State in the Interest of M.T.S.  
d. By force or threat of force—Threat of Force 
 
 
(1) Subjective fear requirement 
 
 
(2) Objective fear requirement 
 
 
 
e. Resistance and danger to victim 
(1) 1970s-80s research indicated resistance may endanger 
victims 
 
 
 
 
(2) Later research reflects that earlier findings were flawed 
(a) Overrepresented stranger rape—violent 
convicted rapists 
(b) Acquaintance rape out-numbers stranger rapes, 
and resistance usually succeeds with 
acquaintances 
(c) Initial rapist violence provokes victim resistance 
rather than the other way around

the victim hasn’t consented to the intercourse 
 
 
 
 
(1) Case: Regina v. Morgan (England) 
 
 
3. Circumstance—Non-consent by the victim  
a. Formal law—State has to prove non-consent beyond a 
reasonable doubt 
b. Informal practice—Defendants raise consent by the victim as a 
defense 
 
 
 
c. Consent doesn’t have to be in writing 
 
D. Statutory rape (LO10)  
 
 
1. Victim’s immaturity substitutes for the element of consent 
 
 
2. Strict liability as to age in most states 
 
 
3. A few states allow a defense of reasonable mistake of age. 
 
E. Grading Degrees of Rape (LO11)  
 
 
1. Simple rape 
2. Aggravated rape is rape with injury, a stranger, another crime, an armed 
rapist, multiple rapists, or a minor victim.

CHAPTER SUMMARY  
 
Crimes against persons involve four types: taking a life (homicide), unwanted sexual 
invasions (sex offenses), bodily injury (assault and battery), and personal restraint 
(kidnapping and false imprisonment). In one form or another, all of these were common-
law crimes. 
 
Sex offenses are serious even if there is no physical injury because they violate intimacy, 
privacy, and bodily integrity in a way typical physical injury cannot. The criminal justice 
system handles rapes by strangers and men with weapons well, but it doesn’t do as well 
with the overwhelming number of rapes by men who know their victims, including date 
rape.   
 
The old rape law defined a crime of forcible sexual penetration that only men could 
commit against women who weren’t their wives. The elements of rape at common law

were: 1) intentional vaginal intercourse; 2) between a man and a woman who was not his 
wife; 3) achieved by force or a threat of severe bodily harm; 4) without the woman’s 
consent. 
 
Modern statutes have expanded the crime of rape and other sex crimes in criminal sexual 
conduct statutes. These new offenses include a list of gender-neutral sex offenses 
involving unwanted sexual penetrations and contacts. Rape in most jurisdictions today 
has four elements: 1) the actus reus of sexual penetration; 2) the actus reus of force, or 
threat of force, to accomplish sexual penetration (or some substitute such as 
unconsciousness, mental impairment, etc.); 3) the mens rea of intentional sexual 
penetration; and 4) the circumstance of the lack of victim consent.  Rape cases are often 
unreported due to the element of shame and embarrassment.  It is even less reported if the 
victim is a male.   
 
One controversial issue is whether there should also be a specific intent element in rape. 
The leading case on the point is the controversial English case of Regina v. Morgan 
(1975). Morgan and three companions were drinking in a bar. When they failed to find 
female companionship, Morgan invited the others to come home with him to have sexual 
intercourse with his wife. Morgan told the others that she would want to have sex with 
them and would only pretend to resist. He told them not to worry if she struggled because 
she liked rough sex. The Sixth House of Lords (England’s highest court) overturned the 
convictions because the defendants didn’t specifically intend to have sexual intercourse 
without the victim’s consent. Why? Because the defendants believed that Morgan’s wife 
wanted sex and wanted the struggle. 
 
When American courts face the intent question they vary in their response. Many come 
down between the English specific-intent rule and strict liability on the issue of intent or 
knowledge to have sex without the victims consent. Some of these courts have adopted a 
reckless or negligent standard with regard to the consent problem. 
 
Current rape law has shifted the emphasis from the resistance of victims to lack of 
consent. The traditional emphasis on physical violence (or threats thereof) to satisfy the 
element of force in the actus reus of rape is shifting in modern rape law to the sufficiency 
of non-consent to unwanted sexual activity. 
  
According to the law, the prosecution has to prove non-consent by the victim beyond a 
reasonable doubt. However, as a matter of strategy, defendants claim victim consent as a 
defense.  
 
Most current statutes divide rape into two degrees: simple (second-degree) rape and 
aggravated (first-degree) rape. Aggravated rape involves at least one of the following 
circumstances: victim suffers serious bodily injury, stranger rape, rape occurs in 
conjunction with another crime, rapist is armed, there are multiple offenders, or the 
victim is a minor while the rapist is significantly older. All other rapes are “simple” rapes 
with lesser penalties.

Much of the law of rape and rape prosecution has changed over the years. The marital 
exception and prompt report rule have been abolished in many jurisdictions. 
Corroboration of the victim’s testimony is no longer required. Rape shield laws limit the 
ability of the defense to bring out evidence of the victim’s prior sex life. Utmost 
resistance by the victim is no longer required. Reasonable resistance is enough. 
 
Bodily injury crimes include unlawful nonsexual contacts (battery) or threats of them 
(assault). The elements of battery are negligently, recklessly, knowingly, or purposely 
causing an unlawful offensive touching of another. The grading of the seriousness of a 
battery depends on the amount of injury and the circumstances of the touching. 
 
An assault requires no touching. There are two kinds of assault: attempted battery (having 
the specific intent to commit battery and taking steps to complete it) and threatened 
battery (intentionally scaring the victim). In both types, the victim must be aware of the 
defendant’s conduct. 
 
Domestic violence crimes have historically been prosecuted under assault and battery 
statutes.  Because family violence has been shown to be far more than just a private 
concern, some states have enacted specific domestic violence crimes. These generally 
apply the assault and battery crimes to situations involving domestic partners or other 
family members. Ohio’s statute, by way of example, shows that repeat domestic violence 
results in increased punishment and elevation of assault and battery from misdemeanor 
level to felony level.  
 
Although stalking has occurred for centuries in 1990, California enacted the first criminal 
stalking statute. Most states have since followed suit, but there is tremendous variation in 
these statutes. Stalking involves repeated, unwanted, and threatening conduct which 
either places the victim in fear, or would cause a reasonable person to fear. Stalking is 
widespread and has major negative effects on its victims. Cyberstalking is a type of 
stalking in which the stalker uses the internet, e-mail, or electronic communication 
devices to threaten the victim.  
 
Kidnapping and false imprisonment are crimes against the right to come and go as we 
please. At common law, kidnapping consisted of six elements: 1) seizing 2) carrying 
away (asportation of)  3) confining 4) another person 5) by force, threat of force, fraud, or 
deception 6) with the intent to deprive the other of their liberty.  
 
The critical difference between false imprisonment and kidnapping is that the actus reus 
of asportation (carrying away) of victims is required in kidnapping. Modern 
interpretations have rendered the asportation requirement of kidnapping almost 
meaningless. 
 
Kidnapping is usually divided into two degrees: simple and aggravated. The most 
common aggravating circumstances include kidnapping for the purpose of sexual 
invasion, taking a hostage, getting ransom, terrorizing the victim, and achieving political

goals. The penalty for aggravated kidnapping is typically life imprisonment and, until 
recently, even death.  
 
The elements of false imprisonment are restraining another person’s liberty with specific 
intent to restrain. The Model Penal Code requires the restraint to “interfere substantially 
with the victim’s liberty,” but in most states any interference with another person’s 
liberty suffices. In many states false imprisonment means forcibly, by threat, or secretly 
confining, abducting, imprisoning, or restraining another person against their will and 
without legal authority.

Discuss the four types of crimes against persons.  
 
Crimes against persons involve taking a life (criminal homicide), unwanted 
sexual invasions (rape, sodomy, sexual contact, sexual assault and other sexually 
invasive offenses), bodily injury and threats of bodily injury (battery, assault, 
menacing) and personal restraint (kidnapping and false imprisonment).   There is 
variance among the states as to the grades of the crimes, often based upon the 
level of mens rea and the degree of harm experienced by the victim.  Modern 
statutes concerning stalking and domestic violence are new approaches to older 
crimes against persons that attempt to resolve some of the difficulty in 
prosecuting these offenses. LO 1

Over time, how has the law of rape changed with regard to force and consent?  
 
Rape law has changed over time with regard to the force and consent 
requirements which seem to be intertwined.  Although lack of consent has always 
been the pivotal issue in determining whether the contact is rape, many recent 
sexual assault statutes have shifted the emphasis away from whether there was 
consent by the victim because they work to the disadvantage of women who 
acquiesced to threatened violence.  Similarly, the Model Penal Code eliminated 
the consent as an element in the rape law.  The law’s development is seen by its 
transition from the utmost resistance standard to the reasonable resistance 
standard as a show of lack of consent. Currently, many states have dropped the 
resistance requirement completely in stranger rapes. The element of force or 
threat of force is part of the actus reus requirement of rape both historically and 
under modern statutes (except for statutory rape).  States vary on whether the 
intrinsic force used to accomplish the rape, or some additional extrinsic force, is 
necessary to satisfy the force requirement.  The resistance issue playas  part in 
the force discussion in the same manner it did as to the issue of consent. LO 4, 5

Compare and contrast the crimes (and elements) of kidnapping and false 
imprisonment.  
 
 
Kidnapping and false imprisonment are both crimes of personal restraint.  They 
differ in that kidnapping requires the element of asportation whereas false 
imprisonment does not.    Asportation means that the victim is moved a 
substantial distance from one area to another, but how far that distance is varies 
by state and in the end is a jury question.  Both kidnapping and false 
imprisonment require that the offender intends to deprive the victim of personal 
liberty (to come and go as we please-the right of locomotion).  The carrying away 
requirement of kidnapping is not present in false imprisonment.  False 
imprisonment is compelling another person to remain where he doesn’t want to 
remain.  These can be forcible detentions, but many statutes find false 
imprisonment with any interference with the person’s liberty. L0 11 
 
4. 
Compare and contrast the crimes of assault and battery.  
 
Battery involves causing physical harm or injury to another.  It requires 
unwanted and unjustified offensive touching that involves some injury.  Assault is 
either threatened battery or attempted battery, and does not involve injury.  The 
mens rea for battery varies from statute to statute, and batteries may be graded 
based upon the mens rea of the offender.  Similarly, the degree of injury may 
determine the grade of the battery.  The mens rea for attempted battery assault is 
the intent to commit a battery (purposeful and intentional behavior) and for 
threatened battery assault is the intent to frighten the victim.  Attempted battery 
assault involves incomplete physical injury whereas threatened battery assault is 
directed at psychological or emotional harm.  LO 8

Discuss the prevalence of acquaintance rape and attempts to combat acquaintance 
rape.  
 
In the 1970s and 1980s the crime of rape underwent many modifications due, in 
part, to the recognition that many, if not most, were non-violent (though non-
consensual).  Nonconsensual sex between acquaintances make up the majority of 
rapes, but the criminal justice system has had difficulty in addressing “unarmed 
acquaintance rape.”  Victims are less likely to report, prosecutors less likely to 
prosecute, and jurors less likely to convict when the sexual encounter is between 
acquaintances.  Unfortunately, the prevalence of “date rape” is high, and 
reporting is very, very low.  Foreman’s survey shows that one in five college 
women reported being physically forced to have sexual intercourse by her date.  
Of non-reported rapes, Williams found that 80 percent of the women who did not 
report indicated they had been raped by men they knew.   LO 3

Crimes Against Property 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. To know that crimes against other people’s property consist of taking, damaging 
or destroying, and invading property. 
 
2. To understand that the crime of theft grew out of the general social concern with 
violent crimes against persons. 
 
3. To know the different “taking” crimes – larceny, embezzlement, false pretenses, 
white-collar crime, robbery, and receiving stolen property.   
 
4. To know how consolidated theft statues combined the laws of larceny, 
embezzlement, and false pretenses into one offense called “theft.”  
 
5. To know that the federal mail fraud statute defines false pretenses much more 
broadly than common law crimes of fraudulently taking other people’s property. 
 
6. To appreciate that the heart of robbery is the use of actual or threatened force to 
obtain someone else’s property right now. 
 
7. To know that it’s illegal to receive stolen property only if you intend to keep it 
permanently. 
 
8. To know that “destroying or damaging” property crimes include both the felony 
of arson and the misdemeanor criminal mischief.   
 
9. To know the elements of criminal mischief.  
 
10. To appreciate that the heart of both burglary and criminal trespass is invading 
other people’s property, not taking, destroying, or damaging it.   
 
11. To understand that criminal trespass used to be limited to unauthorized invasions 
of physical property, but now it includes unauthorized access to electronic 
information systems.  
 
12. To know and appreciate that there are more than twice as many victims of identity 
theft in the United States than burglary, vehicle theft, and robbery combined.  
 
13. To appreciate that intellectual property theft causes annual losses of billions of 
dollars each year, and the amount appears to be increasing greatly.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Crimes against property fall into one of three categories: taking it, damaging or 
destroying it, or invading it. In recent centuries, technology has afforded many new ways 
to steal. The new crimes created to deal with the new types of property crime are really 
only new ways of committing the three original types of crimes. Computer and internet 
crimes consist of taking, damaging or destroying, or invading other people’s computers 
or the information stored on them.  
 
Historically, all crimes of taking property descend from larceny, which means sneaking 
away with, or stealing, someone else’s property. However, as times changed, other 
crimes developed to address the fact that sometimes people wrongfully take property 
entrusted to them, called embezzlement, or trick people into obtaining title of the 
property, termed false pretences. Modern consolidated theft statutes now deal with the 
various ways people acquire other’s property (sneaking away, converting, through fraud). 
Theft (or larceny) is a specific-intent crime; it requires the intent to permanently deprive 
the other person of their property.  
 
Robbery is a crime against persons and their property. It involves taking someone else’s 
property from their person by force or the threat of immediate force. Robbery consists of 
three elements. The actus reus components are: 1) the taking and carrying away, 2) by 
immediate force or the threat of immediate force, 3) another person’s property from their 
body or presence. The mens rea is the intent to permanently deprive the victim of their 
property by immediate force or the threat of immediate force. The circumstance element 
is that the property is taken from the victim’s person or presence.  It is important to 
highlight that theft and burglary are classified as property crimes while a robbery is 
classified as a violent crime against a person.  A very common mistake for many people 
is the following example:  a person gets home after a night out and realizes his house was 
broken in to and his valuables were taken.  He picks up the phone and tells the 911 
dispatcher, “I’ve just been robbed!”  This example illustrates a common mistake our

“burglarized” which is a completely different crime than being robbed.  A clear 
distinction between burglary, theft, and robbery must be made.     
 
Extortion, also called blackmail, is a crime against persons and their property. Theft by 
extortion is taking someone else’s property by threats of future harm. Time separates 
extortion from robbery.  Robbery is a threat to hurt someone right now if they don’t give 
up their property, while extortion is a threat to hurt someone later. The elements of 
extortion consist of mens rea, the specific intent to take someone else’s property by 
means of threats, and actus reus, a specific threat by which the taking of property is 
accomplished. 
 
Obtaining property already stolen by someone else is still regarded as a crime. 
Traditionally, it was called receiving stolen property.  
Arson, which means damaging or destroying other people’s buildings by fire or 
explosives, is a felony. Criminal mischief, which means destroying or tampering with 
other people’s property or causing money loss by “expensive practical jokes” or false 
threats, is a misdemeanor. Criminal mischief includes three types of harm to tangible 
property: 1) destruction or damage by fire, explosives, or other “dangerous acts” (the 
original malicious mischief); 2) tampering with tangible property so as to endanger it; 
and 3) deception or threat that causes monetary loss. 
 
The elements of common-law burglary from which our modern burglary emerged 
included: 1) breaking and entering (actus reus), 2) the dwelling of another (circumstance 
element), 3) in the nighttime (circumstance element), 4) with the intent to commit a 
felony inside (mens rea).  
 
Modern burglary has outgrown its common-law origin of just protecting homes. Now, 
you can “burglarize” all kinds of structures, even vehicles, at any time of the day. The 
breaking and entering elements have been eliminated or modified, and the predicate 
crimes do not always have to be a felony. 
 
A less serious crime related to burglary is criminal trespass. The actus reus of criminal 
trespass is the unauthorized entering of, or remaining on, the premises of another. The 
mens rea varies, including 1) knowingly entering or remaining without authority 
invitation, license privilege, or legality; 2) specific intent to enter or remain without 
authority for some unlawful purpose (a few states); or 3) strict liability. 
 
Although relatively new, cybercrime is the most common crime in America. It consists of 
identity theft and intellectual property theft. Identity theft involves taking another’s 
property by stealing their name and personal information (their identity). Intellectual 
property theft is taking someone’s ideas or creative endeavors. Cybercrime involves the 
use of computers to gain access to identity, ideas, or creative endeavors. Cybercriminals 
are smart, skilled, and motivated. 
Catching intellectual property and identity thieves is very difficult.

Compare and contrast intellectual property crimes and identity theft crimes. How 
has the rise of computer use enhanced these crimes?   
 
Identity theft involves stealing another’s personal information for illegal gain or 
to harm the victim whereas intellectual property theft involves stealing another’s 
ideas for illegal gain. Both of these crimes have been expanded in an 
unprecedented way by the internet. The storage of information on national and 
international databases makes victims particularly vulnerable.  LO 10 11

Compare larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses.   
 
 Larceny was the original common law crime of theft.  It involved sneaking away 
the tangible property of another. Over time, there was a need to respond to the 
new ways that people were taking the property of another. The crime of 
embezzlement arose to cover situations in which an individual was initially 
lawfully in possession of the property, but then unlawfully converted for his own 
use and permanently depriving the lawful owner of the property. The crime of 
false pretenses arose to deal with the situation when an individual misrepresented 
something in order to unlawfully get ownership of the property of another. For 
example, if you sold a painting you know is not a Van Gogh as a Van Gogh for 
millions of dollars you make a material misrepresentation in order to deprive the 
other person of their property. In modern times, most states no longer distinguish 
between larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses, choosing to enact 
consolidated theft statutes covering the various ways thieves come into possession 
of the property of another. LO 2 
 
3. 
Compare the crimes of burglary and criminal trespass. 
 
Criminal trespass and burglary are both crimes of invading another’s property.  
The crime of burglary adds the element of the intent to commit a crime while on 
the property. At common law, there were very specific requirements for burglary 
including the elements of breaking, entering, at night, dwelling, of another, with 
the intent to commit a felony. Many of those elements have been relaxed under 
modern statutes. Now, it is often sufficient that a person enter lawfully but remain 
unlawfully. States vary on the nature of the predicate crime. Some require that it 
be theft, others that it must be a felony, still others allow intent to commit any 
crime (misdemeanor or felony—other than trespass). LO 8 
 
4. 
Compare and contrast robbery and extortion.  
 
Robbery is taking property of another by force or threat of force. Extortion is 
taking the property of another by some future threat. For example, robbery would 
involve a person taking another’s wallet after demanding, “Your money or your 
life.” Extortion would involve a person saying, “If you don’t give me $10,000 I 
will send Guido to break your kneecaps next week.” Both robbery and extortion 
involve taking someone else’s property by threat of force, but extortion threatens 
future harm. Additionally, extortion can involve threats of not only physical harm 
but also would include threats to embarrass the other. LO 1, 6

Compare and contrast arson and criminal trespass.  
 
Arson and criminal mischief are both crimes that damage or destroy another’s 
property. Arson involves setting fire to another’s property. Common law arson 
required the property be another’s dwelling, and that the fire had to reach the 
structure.  Modern arson statutes tend to grade arson based upon the type of 
structure and the amount of damage. Arson also includes explosions. At common 
law, arson was considered a “general intent” crime meaning that the person 
needed to intend to light something on fire and need not intend to destroy the 
property.  Now, modern statutes tend to grade arson based to some extent on the 
intent of the offender. Criminal mischief involves damaging the tangible property 
of another. One extension of criminal mischief that doesn’t necessarily involve the 
destruction of property includes using deception or threat to cause someone to 
suffer a monetary loss. State statutes on arson and criminal mischief vary greatly 
as to the mens rea requirement and occasionally as to the actus reus requirement.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES  
 
1. To understand the origins and development of how disorderly conduct expanded 
to include “quality of life” offenses aimed at “bad manners” in public.  
 
2. To know how efforts to control bad manners in public underscore the tension 
between order and liberty in constitutional democracies. 
 
3. To know the definition of disorderly conduct and its forms (individuals and 
groups)  
 
4. To understand that the “broken windows” theory claims “quality of life” crimes 
are linked to serious crime. 
 
5. To appreciate that the widespread consensus among all classes, races, and 
communities that bad behavior of “street peoples” and “street gangs” should be 
controlled, has shaped the content of the criminal law. 
 
6. To understand that most people are more worried about bad public manners than 
they are about serious crimes. 
 
7. To know the difference between vagrancy and loitering and to understand the 
history of laws that address these crimes.   
 
8. To know the definition of panhandling and understand the legal arguments that 
have arisen in its restriction, due to First Amendment protections.  
 
9. To understand that fear of gangs has led state and city governments to enact 
criminal laws to obtain civil gang injunctions to regulate gang behavior.   
 
10. To appreciate that the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of civil gang 
injunctions in controlling gang behavior is mixed.   
 
11. To know that “victimless crimes” against public decency (the ancient “crimes 
against public morals”) are a hot-button issue between those who believe that 
criminal law should enforce morality and those who believe the nonviolent 
behavior of competent adults is none of the law’s business.  An example of such a 
crime is prostitution.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Issues of public order include both individual disorderly conduct crimes, such as fighting 
or making unreasonable noise, and group disorderly conduct crimes, such as unlawful 
assembly, rout, and riot. Public order crimes also include “bad manner” crimes known as 
quality-of-life crimes. These ancient crimes, such as vagrancy and loitering, have been 
applied to new situations like street gangs. Public order crimes highlight the tension 
between order and liberty and include the controversial category of “victimless” crimes, 
such as prostitution and solicitation.  
 
The Model Penal Code was very influential in shaping the current law. The code limits 
conduct that qualifies as disorderly conduct actus reus to three kinds: 1) fighting in 
public; 2) making unreasonable noise or using abusive language; and 3) creating a 
“hazardous or physically offensive condition” like strewing garbage, setting off “stink 
bombs,” or turning off lights in crowded public places. The code was also unusual in that 
it had a mens rea element. 
 
Group disorderly conduct consisted of three misdemeanors at the common law: unlawful 
assembly, rout, and riot. All three were aimed at preventing the ultimate evil of open 
disorder and breach of the public peace. Unlawful assembly was committed when a group 
of at least three persons joined together for the purpose of committing an unlawful act. If 
the group of three or more started toward achieving their purpose, they committed the 
crime of rout. If the group actually committed an unlawful violent act, or performed a 
lawful act in a “violent or tumultuous manner,” they committed the crime of riot (if there 
were twelve of them). Committing riot didn’t require the group to plan their unlawful 
violent act in advance. It was enough that once together they came up with the plan of 
violence.  
 
Some disorderly conduct crimes are now called quality-of-life crimes, but they’re still 
aimed at the same conduct—“bad manners” in public places. Efforts to control bad 
manners in public underscore the tension between order and liberty in constitutional 
democracies. Order is acting in accordance with ordinary standards of good manners and 
decency. Liberty is freedom to come and go and do as we like without government 
interference. The U.S. Supreme Court has used the term “ordered liberty” to describe this 
need for both. 
 
Quality-of-life crimes are minor offenses, but the broken-windows theory claims (based 
on mixed empirical results) that they’re linked to serious crime. In the 1980s, two 
scholars noted a deep public need for what they called a lost sense of public “good 
manners,” especially in our largest cities. Professors James Q. Wilson and George L. 
Kelling (1982) suggested that what were labeled “petty crimes” weren’t just “bothering” 
law-abiding people; they were connected to serious crime. They called this connection 
between disorderly conduct and serious crime the broken-windows theory. According to 
Kelling, research conducted since the article was written in 1982 has demonstrated a 
direct link between public disorder and crime. Others argue that both disorder and serious

crime are caused by the same factors and that disorder does not always lead to serious 
crime. 
 
There is widespread public support among all classes, races, and communities for 
controlling the offensive behaviors of “street people” and “street gangs.” Most people are 
more worried about bad public manners (loitering, panhandling, public drunkenness, and 
prostitution) than they are about serious crimes (rape, robbery, burglary, and assault).  
 
A number of state and city governments have passed criminal laws to regulate gang 
behavior. In some places it’s a crime to participate in a gang. Some statutes and 
ordinances have stiffened the penalties for crimes committed by gang members. Others 
make it a crime to encourage minors to participate in gangs. Some have applied 
organized crime statutes to gangs. A few have punished parents for their children’s gang 
activities. Cities have also passed ordinances banning gang members from certain public 
places, particularly city parks.  
 
Laws against loitering, vagrancy, panhandling, and non-criminal gang activity raise 
serious issues of due process (void-for-vagueness) and violation of First Amendment 
rights. Many loitering, vagrancy, panhandling, and anti-gang laws have been found to be 
unconstitutional. However, carefully written laws that are specific and content-neutral 
about time, place, and manner restrictions can be constitutional if other outlets for 
expression are available. 
 
Government ability to regulate speech, including panhandling, varies with the type of 
public property involved. In traditional public forums, government power is weakest. 
Traditional public forums include public parks and streets. Government power is at an 
intermediate level in designated public forums, which are public places that the 
government has set aside or designated for speech activities. Auditoriums or public 
bulletin boards would be examples. Government power is strongest in nonpublic forums 
such as government office buildings and military bases. 
 
In addition to criminal penalties, cities have also turned to civil remedies to control gang 
activity. For example, the government has requested and received public nuisance 
injunctions that declare gang activities and gang members to be public nuisances and 
order the “abatement” (stopping) of the public nuisance. Civil gang injunctions have been 
found to reduce gang activity in the short term but not in the long run. They have also 
been found to reduce violent crime in the first year after their implementation.  
 
“Victimless” crimes (the ancient “crimes against public morals”) are a controversial 
issue. It pits those who believe the criminal law should enforce morality against those 
who believe the private, nonviolent, consensual behavior of competent adults is none of 
the law’s business. The Wolfendon Report, a British report from the 1950s, 
recommended that private consensual adult homosexuality and prostitution be 
decriminalized.

Victimless crimes include crimes between consenting adults, and/or crimes in which the 
victim does not perceive themselves as being a victim. A number of types of offenses 
have been termed victimless. Among these are substance abuse, internet censorship, 
loitering, prostitution, sodomy, seatbelt law violations, helmet law violations, bans on 
bungee jumping, and laws against assisted suicide. Crimes involving a willing buyer and 
seller, such as prostitution, drug, and firearms crimes can also be victimless crimes. 
 
Prostitution is an ancient business, prospering in all cultures at all times, in spite of being 
illegal. It’s also a crime nearly everywhere in the United States. Prostitution used to be 
reserved for the act of selling sexual intercourse for money and only selling, not buying, 
sex was included. Now, it means all contacts and penetrations as long as they’re done 
with the intent to gratify sexual appetite. Both patrons (buyers) and prostitutes (sellers) 
can commit prostitution. In the past, the law recognized only women as prostitutes. Now 
both men and women who sell sex are prostitutes. 
 
It’s a crime not only to buy and sell sex, but also to solicit prostitution (sometimes called 
promoting prostitution, “pimping,” or “pandering”). Soliciting prostitution means getting 
customers for prostitutes and/or providing a place for prostitutes and customers to engage 
in sex for money. Prostitution and promoting prostitution are misdemeanors in most 
states, but it’s a serious felony when circumstances such as minors and violence are 
involved.

Explain the broken-windows theory and provide examples.  
 
Wilson and Kelling’s broken windows theory suggests a connection between 
disorderly conduct/quality of life crimes band serious crime. They found a link 
between order and crime. Skogan cautions that the connection is not necessarily a 
causal one, but agrees that disorder needs to be taken seriously because it plays a 
role in neighborhood decline. Harcourt found a weak-to-no-causal link between 
disorder and serious crime. Sampson and Raudenbush found that disorder and 
serious crime have common causes but not any direct causal relation with each 
other. LO 3

Compare and contrast individual disorderly conduct and group disorderly 
conduct. Give  examples.  
 
Individual disorderly conduct is common law breach of peace and includes 
fighting in public, making unreasonable noise, or engaging in conduct that 
provokes others to engage in disorderly conduct. The most common use of 
disorderly conduct is the ban on fighting in public. Group disorderly conduct 
consists of three common law crimes: unlawful assembly (three or more people 
joining for the purpose of committing an unlawful act), rout (taking steps toward 
achieving their purpose of committing an unlawful act), and riot (the group 
actually committing the lawful violent act or performing a lawful act in a violent 
manner).  Because riots involve especially alarming and dangerous behavior, all 
states still have the crime of riot, and it is generally a felony offense whereas most 
disorderly conduct crimes are misdemeanor offenses. LO 1,2 
 
3. 
What is the void-for-vagueness doctrine and what impact did it have on traditional 
 
loitering and vagrancy laws?  
 
The void for vagueness doctrine (also discussed in Chapter 2) flows from the 
requirement of due process. Individuals need to be put on notice what type of 
behavior will violate the law. If the law is too vague then they cannot conform 
their behavior and may fall into law breaking. Another concern when laws are 
vaguely written is that they encourage arbitrary law enforcement. Vagrancy and 
loitering laws which were popular prior to the 1950s were challenged on void for 
vagueness grounds, primarily because of their uneven administration (arbitrary 
law enforcement).  Vagrancy and loitering laws tended to be used to punish and 
control displaced poor, and the Court has since struck down many of these 
statutes based on void-for-vagueness grounds.  LO 2, 4 
 
4. 
Discuss the types of restrictions that the government can place on panhandling. 
Compare and contrast the three types of First Amendment forums.  
 
Panhandling, asking others for food or money, is speech.  Although it is protected 
by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, it is nevertheless subject to time, 
place, and manner restrictions.  These restrictions must not be based on the 
content of the speech, they must serve a governmental interest, and they must 
allow for other channels of expression.  Additionally, speech in public forums 
(streets, sidewalks, parks) is “more protected” than speech in nonpublic forms 
(airports, bus stations, subways, shopping malls)—this means that the 
government has more power to put restrictions on speech in nonpublic forums.   
Finally, because panhandling is considered commercial speech, it is subject to 
more restriction than other types of speech.  (LO 5)

Discuss the main points of the controversy regarding “victimless” crimes. 
 
The controversy surrounding “victimless” crimes exists because of the tension 
between personal autonomy and the governments’ interest in protecting the public 
good, which is often read as public morals.  The controversy exists because there 
is a polarization among individuals who believe that the criminal law should 
enforce morals to purify society and individuals who believe that non-violent 
behavior by consenting adults is none of the criminal law’s business.  LO 6

Crimes Against the State 
 
 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES    
 
1. Understand how defining and applying crimes against the state reflects the 
enduring idea of balancing security and freedom during wartime emergencies. 
 
2. Know that treason is the only crime that is defined in the Constitution; is a 
fundamental weapon against present allegiance and support to foreign enemies; 
and is very difficult to prove because of its history.   
 
3. To know the definition of other ancient crimes of disloyalty, specifically sedition, 
sabotage, and espionage.   
 
4. Appreciate that crimes against potential terrorist attacks are subject to the limits 
placed on traditional criminal law. 
 
5. Know that the most commonly prosecuted crimes against the state since 
September 11, 2001, have involved alleged terrorists or terrorist organizations. 
 
6. Appreciate that “providing material support or resources” is open to constitutional 
challenges.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
 
Governments everywhere have always had to rely on laws to protect them against foreign 
enemies and ensure the allegiance and loyalty of their citizens. During times of national 
emergency we must try to strike the proper balance between security and freedom. 
 
Treason is an ancient crime and it is the only crime defined in the U.S. Constitution. 
Article III provides: “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War 
against them, or, in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person 
shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same 
overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.” The treason sections in the U.S. Code flesh 
out these terms.

Chapter 13: Crimes Against the State 
283 
 
 
It is a crime against the state not only to commit treason but also to encourage others to 
overthrow the government by violence. Advocating the violent overthrow of the 
government is called sedition. 
 
Sabotage is the crime of destroying or damaging property with the intent of interfering 
with and hindering preparations for war and defense during national emergencies. 
Espionage is another term for spying for the enemy. It includes gathering information 
harmful to national security and defense, and communicating that information to hostile 
groups or nations. 
 
Some of the recent legislation on these topics is part of the USA Patriot Act, which is the 
best known of the recent acts. It is an acronym for “Uniting and Strengthening America 
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism.” Aimed at 
terrorists, it was passed and signed into law on October 16, 2001, after the devastating 
September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The new laws 
divide terrorism into two kinds—international and domestic. Domestic terrorism involves 
acts within the U.S., while acts outside the U.S. are deemed international terrorism. 
 
A number of sections of the U.S. Code are available for prosecuting crimes related to 
terrorists and terrorist organizations. Among the crimes specifically aimed at terrorism 
are U.S. Code Title 18, Chapter 113B, “Terrorism”, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective 
Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) (1996), and the USA Patriot Act (2001).  The U.S. Code 
divides terrorism into international terrorism and domestic terrorism.  
 
Among the offenses in these new laws are: 1) the use of certain weapons of mass 
destruction; 2) harboring or concealing terrorists; 3) providing material support to 
terrorists; and 4) providing material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist 
organizations. The fourth-listed law has probably been the one most utilized by the 
government. 
 
A number of legal challenges have been launched against these laws. The two most 
utilized challenges are due process (void-for vagueness) and First Amendment freedom 
of speech and association.   In U.S. v. Lindh, Lindh failed to get his indictment thrown out 
on vagueness and overbreadth challenges, and he subsequently entered a plea.  In 
Humanitarian Law Project v. Reno, the court held that the term “personnel” in the act 
was vague.  In response, Congress amended the material support provisions in the 
Intelligence Reform and Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2004 (IRTPA).  However, in 
Humanitarian Law Project v. Mukasey (2009), the court similarly held while “personnel” 
was no longer vague, other parts of IRTPA were constitutionally impermissible.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
 
1. Discuss why treason is the only crime defined in our Constitution and why it is so 
hard to prove.  Do you think the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg (and modern 
evidence that Ethel may not have been involved) has had an impact on how we 
view and punish charges of treason? 
LO2 
 
2. Discuss and summarize sabotage and espionage.  What are your thoughts on 
Bradley Manning? Do you consider his actions to be sabotage, or heroic?  
LO3 
 
3. Research current event articles involving terrorist acts/crimes and look up the 
Department of Defense’s list of domestic terrorists.  How do domestic terrorists 
differ from international terrorists? Did some of the groups on the domestic 
terrorist list surprise you? Does this challenge your preconceived notions of 
terrorists? Why or why not?

1.  
Compare and contrast sabotage.  Provide examples. 
Sabotage is purposefully (or willfully) damaging or destroying property for the 
purpose of interfering with and hindering preparations for war and defense 
during national emergencies. Sabotage would be the appropriate crime to charge 
when an individual set off an explosion that took down a transmission tower if we 
were at war or there was a national emergency. As a crime, sabotage seems to be 
the most restrictive because it focuses on being at war or having an actual 
national emergency. The idea is that one is purposefully trying to impede the 
country in its efforts to defend itself.  Espionage is spying either during times of 
peace or during war.  If one spies during peace time, then it entails gathering 
information and turning it over with the intent to hurt the United States or help a 
foreign country. Espionage during war involves gathering and turning over 
information about the military actions that may be useful to the enemy.  Sabotage 
and espionage are both aimed at hurting the United States in its ability to protect

itself, but they are accomplished in very different manners—sabotage being a 
direct attack on a physical place, and espionage using information that can then 
be used by the enemy. LO 1 
 
2. 
Compare and contrast treason and sedition. Provide  examples. 
 
The constitutional crime of treason involves levying war against the United States 
or giving enemies of the United States aid and comfort. To commit treason, one 
must intentionally give aid with the purpose of betraying the United States.  
Sedition means to stir up others to overthrow the government by violence. The 
crimes are not mutually exclusive, but sedition is not punishable by death whereas 
treason is. It is possible to commit sedition without committing treason (stirring 
up others to levy war or not giving aid to the enemy), and it is possible to commit 
treason without committing sedition (individually committing acts which give the 
enemies of the U.S. aid and comfort without stirring up anyone to violently 
overthrow the government).  LO 1, 2 
 
3. 
What does the U.S. Constitution say about the crime of treason? 
 
Treason is the only crime mentioned in the Constitution. The framers walked a 
tight rope in writing treason into the Constitution: they had to take a strong 
position against those who were against the new government, but they also had to 
account for the fact that they too would have been guilty of treason in England.  
So, they limited the behavior which constituted treason, made it a very serious 
crime, and worked in some protections, such as limiting legislatures and courts 
from creating new means of treasons, requiring two witnesses to an overt act or 
open confession, and included it in the Constitution where it could not easily be 
modified. LO 2 
 
4. 
Discuss the Congressional Acts that deal with both domestic and international 
 
terrorism. Discuss the things that are crimes under each. 
 
In addition to the crimes found in the U.S. Code (murder, conspiracy, 
assault/battery, etc) Congress has passed three Acts which are somewhat 
intertwined dealing with domestic and international terrorism.  The Anti-
Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (1996) (AEDPA) was enacted in 
response to the domestic terrorist attack on the Oklahoma City Federal Building.  
The U.S. Patriot Act was enacted in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001 
that were also domestic attacks (target inside U.S., although individuals 
committing attacks were not U.S. citizens).  Finally, Congress enacted the 
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act which amended the AEDPA 
after some of its provisions were found by lower federal appellate courts to 
violate the Constitution.  Many of AEDPA’s provisions on terrorism were 
incorporated into the Patriot Act, and much of the IRTPA were just modifications 
of these earlier acts.  The crimes that are specified in these acts are: use of 
weapons of mass destruction; acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries,

What Constitutional challenges have been raised to the felony of providing 
material support to terrorists or terrorist organizations? How successful have those 
challenges been? 
 
The legality of the AEDPA, the US Patriot Act, and the IRTPA have been 
challenged based on due process grounds of void-for-vagueness, void for 
overbreadth, but so far, no case has reached the Supreme Court.  In particular, 
the language found in the crime of providing material support to terrorists has 
given plaintiffs such as John Lindh and the Humanitarian Law Project fodder for 
their suits.  The terms “training,” “personnel,” “expert advice or assistance,” 
and “service” have been challenged for being overly vague.  In 2000, in 
Humanitarian Law Project v. Reno, the court did find that the terms were vague 
which resulted in a Congressional amendment (IRPTA).  In 2009, the 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Humanitarian Law Project v. Mukasey, found that the 2004 
amendment, IRTPA, still contained language that violated the U.S. Constitution 
though the amendment did fix some of the troubling language from the material 
support crime found in AEDPA. LO 3
