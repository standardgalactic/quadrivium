Introduction
W
elcome to Illustrator CS4 For Dummies. You’re reading this book 
because you want to find out more about Adobe Illustrator. That’s a 
very smart move because Adobe Illustrator is the industry-standard graphics 
software. Not only does it outsell all its competitors combined (what few of 
them that have not yet been crushed by the awesomeness that is Illustrator), 
it’s also the most powerful graphics-creation tool ever created. With 
Illustrator, all you need to produce graphics like the best you’ve seen in print 
or on the Web is knowledge and artistic ability. Artistic ability is a challenge 
that you can handle on your own. The other half — knowledge — is what this 
book is all about.
Like a tragic hero, the great power of Illustrator is also its terrible curse. With 
its 30+ panels, 70+ tools, and scores of menu items, its sheer depth is enough 
to make the most hardened graphics expert go shaky in the knees. Don’t be 
fooled by Illustrator’s vastness, however, because you will find a unique, con-
sistent logic underlying it all. After you master a few basics, all the rest falls 
nicely into place.
The mission of this book is to get you past Illustrator’s intimidation factor 
and into its Wow! factor. I take you from being befuddled and mystified by 
Illustrator’s nigh-infinite options to creating the kinds of graphics that others 
look at and say, “Wow, how did you do that?”
About This Book
This book is written to make your journey into Adobe Illustrator flexible and 
self paced. Each chapter is as self contained as possible. You can hop in any-
where you want, with a minimum of flipping to other parts of the book to find 
out what you missed. If your goal is to find out more about the Pencil tool, for 
example, you can skip everything else and go directly to Chapter 8 without 
getting hopelessly lost. On the other hand, if you’re determined to find out 
as much about the program as possible, you can read the book from cover to 
cover. I organized the book so that the chapters move from simple to more 
complex concepts. The early chapters make a good base for understanding 
the latter ones.
Use this book as both a reference book and an on-site trainer for Adobe 
Illustrator. To find out more about a specific feature, look for it in the index 
or the table of contents. To get a more in-depth feel for the feature, follow 
the step-by-step instructions that accompany the information on the major 
features.

Illustrator CS4 For Dummies 
By and large, people get more out of doing than out of reading about doing. 
Adobe Illustrator is a classic case-in-point. Don’t bother to memorize any-
thing in this book. Instead, pick up a concept, work with it in Illustrator for a 
while, and then come back to the book when you’re ready for something new. 
Above all, have fun with it! Adobe Illustrator is one of the coolest programs 
on the planet. With a little practice, you can be creating illustrations that 
knock your socks off.
Note: Because I realize that some folks use PCs and some folks use Macs, I try 
to offer commands for both Windows and Macintosh platforms. Occasionally 
I offer information specific to one platform or the other, including keyboard 
shortcuts. While you journey through this book, you’ll see that many figures 
(those that show you what you see on-screen) are a mixed bag of all things 
Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs.
What You Don’t Need to Read
I love to think that you pore over each and every word I write. I also realize 
that you have a life. Feel free to skip any information that seems far afield 
from what you need to know. The stuff that no one should ever really have to 
know (but which is nonetheless utterly fascinating) is clearly labeled with a 
Technical Stuff icon. You’ll also run across some bonus material placed in a 
sidebar — a gray shaded box — that I fill with cool-to-know-but-not-impera-
tive stuff.
Foolish Assumptions
I’m going to make just the following two basic Foolish Assumptions about 
you, Gentle Reader:
 
✓ You have time, patience, and a strong desire to master Adobe 
Illustrator. Illustrator has a steep learning curve at the start; but after 
you get the basics, you find the program pretty straightforward. Getting 
over that first hump is going to take a little endurance and can get pretty 
frustrating at times. Be patient with yourself and the program. All shall 
be revealed in the fullness of time. Until then, this book is intended to 
help you get over that initial learning hump.
 
✓ You have access to a computer with Adobe Illustrator CS4 on it. This 
hands-on book isn’t meant to be read like a novel. If this is your very 
own copy of the book, attack it with highlighters and sticky notes, 
scribble in some marginalia, or even force it open until it lies flat on your 
desk. Then — after you collect all the loose pages and glue ’em back 
in — you can have both hands free to work at the computer while you 
follow along.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
In this book, you find 18 chapters organized in five parts. Each part reflects a 
major Illustrator concept; each chapter chomps a concept into easily digest-
ible morsels. The whole thing is arranged in a logical order, so you can read 
straight through if you’re so inclined. Or you can jump in at any point to find 
the exact information you need. To help you do that, here’s an overview of 
what you can find in each of those five parts.
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap
Here’s where you get the absolute basics of Illustrator. What it is, what it 
does, and why it’s worth the effort. The wonders of blank pages, paths, and 
the beguiling Pen tool all make their debut here. By the time you finish this 
part, you have a good overview of the entire program.
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork
This part is where the fun begins — you roll up your sleeves and start creat-
ing illustrations. Whether or not you can draw using old-fashioned paper and 
pencil (ewww — how 20th century), wait’ll you see what you can create with 
Illustrator!
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School
With Illustrator, you can really unleash your creativity. Unfortunately, 
unleashed creativity often results in an unruly mess. This part looks at how to 
tame the mess through changing parts of graphics, organizing graphics into 
separate layers, and using many other techniques that prove that organization 
and creativity are not mutually exclusive. You don’t even need a smock.
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files
Illustrator is truly a wondrous modifier of written characters, so I devote this 
part to working with type, and then getting your creations to print. I cover 
everything from the most basic formatting to complex type treatments. Stick 
around here, too, for the skinny on posting your art to the Web and moving 
files in and out of Illustrator.
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without its Top Ten lists, and this book is 
no exception. Here are lots of tips to help you use Illustrator more effectively, 
ways to customize Illustrator (chrome hubcaps optional), and some very 
snazzy techniques that will make you the envy of your friends and raise you 
to “nemesis” level with your enemies. Save this part for dessert.

But that’s not all!: Bonus chapters
I tried and I tried but no matter how hard I squeezed, I just couldn’t fit every-
thing into this book. (Kind of like how some people pack a steamer trunk for 
a weekend getaway lark.) Rather than try to skimp on all I wanted to show 
you, I put two extra-cool chapters on the Web for you. These two chapters 
cover putting your art on the Web and techniques for creating some killer 
effects. Check ’em out at www.dummies.com/go/illustratorcs4.
About All Those Little Icons
Scattered throughout this book you find some nifty little icons that point out 
bits of information that are especially useful, important, or noteworthy.
 
Remember helps you remember to remember. The information you find at 
these icons is stuff that you use on a regular basis in Illustrator. Write it down 
on your hand so that you can refer to it at any instant. Just don’t wash that 
hand! Or better yet, bookmark the page or remember the advice you find 
there.
 
Look to these icons for utterly fascinating techno-trivia that most people 
never need to know. This information is the kind you can drop into a conver-
sation at a party to remind people how much smarter you are than everyone 
else. (Assuming that you plan to go home alone, that is.)
 
This bull’s-eye points out information that can help you do something faster, 
easier, or better; save you time and money; or make you the hero of the 
beach. Or at least make you a little less stressed during a production 
crunch!
 
Watch out! This impending-explosion icon means that danger lurks nearby. 
Heed it when directed to those things you should avoid and what things you 
must absolutely never do.
Road Signs along the Way
You will see some special ways I make text look in this book, such as bold 
print or shortcut keys or paths for how to find things. Here’s a quick legend 
for the road signs you should watch for.

 Introduction
When I ask you to type (enter) something — in a text box, for example — I make 
it bold. When you see a construction like this — Choose Edit➪Paste — that 
means to go to the Edit menu and choose Paste from there. Keyboard shortcuts 
look like Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ô+Z (Mac).
Where to Go from Here
Illustrator is a graphics adventure waiting for you to take it on. This book is 
your guide for that adventure. If you’re ravenous to know everything now, 
you can rush through the text as fast as you can, starting with Chapter 1 
and charging right through to the end. Or you can take your time, pick a 
point that interests you, explore it at your leisure, and then come back to 
a different place in the book later. Whatever works best for you, this book 
is your ready-willing-and-able guide for the journey. All you have to do is 
start your computer, launch Illustrator, turn the page, and let the adventure 
begin.

Introducing the World of Illustrator
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a look at how graphic artists use Illustrator
▶ Becoming familiar with the Illustrator interface
▶ Noting some Mac and Windows differences
▶ Creating new documents
▶ Saving your artwork
▶ Printing Illustrator documents
▶ Bailing out of a document (and Illustrator itself)
T
he first time you run Illustrator, you’ll probably think that Adobe 
Intimidator would be a more appropriate name than Adobe Illustrator. The 
program’s dozens of tools, hundreds of commands, and more than 
30 panels can transform confident, secure individuals into 
drooling, confused, and frustrated drones.
The situation doesn’t have to be that way, of course. 
Sure, all that stuff is scary. Even more frightening 
to some is the prospect of facing the giant white 
nothingness of the Document window — the end-
less possibilities, the confusion over where to start. 
This chapter helps you get past that initial stage 
and move forward into the mystical state of eagerly 
awaiting (instead of fearing) each new feature and 
function.
From Humble Origins to Master 
of the Graphics Universe
As its box proudly proclaims, Adobe Illustrator is the “Industry Standard 
Graphics Software.” The software didn’t always enjoy that standing, though. 
Illustrator evolved from a geeky math experiment into the graphics power-
house it is today.

Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
A brief history of Illustrator
Until the mid-1980s, computer art was limited to blocky-looking video 
games, spheroid reflections, and the movie Tron. Then something happened 
to change all that (in addition to Jeff Bridges’ refusal to make a sequel) — 
namely, PostScript, a computer language created especially for printers. 
Adobe created PostScript specifically to help printers produce millions of 
teeny-tiny dots on the page, without running out of memory. (Graphics files 
were notoriously huge relative to the teeny-tiny computers of the day.)
In 1987, Adobe released Illustrator 1.1, which was designed primarily to be a 
front end for PostScript: that is, a way to make its capabilities actually usable. 
At that time, the concept of artwork scalable to any size without loss of qual-
ity (one world-beating advantage of creating art within Illustrator) was brand 
new. Illustrator gave companies the opportunity to have electronic versions 
of their logos that could be printed at any size.
In the 20-plus years since version 1.1, Adobe Illustrator has become the Web-
ready, giant application that it is today. Millions of people around the world 
use Illustrator and its thousands of features (big and small) meet a wide 
variety of graphics needs. Oddly enough, the one aspect of Illustrator that 
hasn’t changed is the perceived intimidation factor. Version 1.1 had several 
tools, many menu items, a neurosis-inducing Pen tool, Bézier curves, and that 
way-scary blank page when you started it up. The most recent version still 
has nearly every feature that 1.1 did and has added a staggering array of new 
features, but it still has that way-scary blank page. Illustrator 1.1 was a playful 
little kitten compared with the beast that is Illustrator CS4!
The new features in Illustrator CS4 include:
 
✓ Multiple Pages: Don’t search for “Multiple Pages” in the list of new 
Illustrator features when you’re looking at the official Adobe documen-
tation. In their infinite wisdom, they have named this feature “Multiple 
Artboards,” but you and I know the truth, so we’ll call it what it is: mul-
tiple pages in Illustrator, 
 
✓ Super-Smart Smart Guides: Little lines and hints that appear as you 
work, helping you to align your drawings automatically. Beware: After 
you start using them, you’ll never be able to go back to the, er, “dumb” 
Smart Guides from previous versions.
 
✓ Streamlined, Shiny User Interface: The first thing you’ll notice are those 
funny little tabs above your document windows. When you’re done 
being distracted by that, however, you’ll find that the panels and tools 
and control panel are all optimized to magically work just the way you 
expect them to, with automatically-resizing panels and options that exist 
only when it makes sense that they do. And did I mention it’s shiny?

 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
Illustrator’s place in the cosmos
Professional graphic artists have a Tools panel of programs that they use to 
create the books, magazines, newspapers, packaging, advertisements, and 
Web sites that you see every day. Any professional will tell you that you need 
the right tool for the job to do the job well. The right tools (in this case) are 
software products: drawing programs, paint programs, and products for 
page layout and Web-authoring. Drawing programs, such as Adobe Illustrator, 
are the best tools for creating crisp, professional-looking graphics (such as 
logos), working with creative type effects, and re-creating photographs from 
line drawings. Painting programs (often called image editing programs), such 
as Adobe Photoshop, provide tools to color-correct, retouch, and edit digital 
photographs and re-create “natural media” effects, such as hand-painting. 
Page layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress, enable you 
to combine graphics that you create in drawing and paint programs with text 
for print publishing. You can use Web-authoring tools (such as Macromedia 
Dreamweaver or Adobe GoLive) to combine graphics, text, sound, animation, 
and interactivity for presentation on the World Wide Web.
Although each tool performs a fairly specific (if wide-ranging) task, there is 
some crossover between applications. For example, Illustrator has some lim-
ited image editing capabilities, but very few people ever use them. Because 
you can edit images with complete control and freedom in Photoshop, why 
use the wrong tool for the job? InDesign enables you to run type along a 
curve, but Illustrator has so many tools for creative type effects that you’d be 
silly to do them anywhere else.
By using Illustrator on its own, you can create an astonishing variety of 
graphics and type effects. When you combine it with paint, page layout, 
video, and Web-authoring programs, you have the tools you need to create 
print and Web publications that match the quality of anything you see in the 
stands or on-screen today.
Illustrator is the de facto standard in graphics creation. Although there used 
to be several competing programs out there (FreeHand, which is now gone 
forever; and CorelDRAW, which stumbles on, somehow unaware that no one 
is paying attention), Illustrator is used more than 20 times as much as any 
competing products combined. This is mainly because it’s the gold standard 
in several ways, from feature breadth and depth to tight integration with other 
standard applications and formats, including Photoshop, Flash, and PDF.
Adobe has products in the other categories: Photoshop, InDesign, Flash, 
After Effects, and Dreamweaver. One benefit of using Illustrator is that it 
works very well (as you might expect) with the other Adobe products, most 
of which have a similar interface and way of working. If you know one Adobe 
product well, chances are that you’ll have an easy time of figuring out other 
Adobe products.

Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
Illustrator excels at creating and editing artwork of all types. In fact, you 
can use Illustrator to create and edit nearly anything that didn’t start out 
as a photograph — and thanks to Live Trace, you can even do that! For 
more about the differences between photographs and artwork created with 
Illustrator, see Chapter 2.
Starting Up Illustrator and Revving It a Little
To get Illustrator running, double-click the application’s icon (Mac) or 
choose Illustrator from the Start menu (Windows). (The first method also 
works in Windows, if you’re a Mac user who happens to be using Windows. 
Don’t worry; I won’t tell a soul. Honest.)
The Illustrator startup process displays the splash screen — an image to look 
at while the program is cranking up. It’s a lovely shade of orange, quite like 
the sunset that has set on Illustrator’s competitors over the years. And you 
can’t miss the giant Ai, which stands (of course) for Adobe Illustrator (and 
also happens to be the two-letter file extension of native Illustrator files). 
As Illustrator continues the startup process, the block of orange disappears 
and is replaced by the Welcome screen, as shown in Figure 1-1. The Welcome 
screen gives the following options to start using Illustrator.
 
✓ Open a Recent Item: Here, you’ll see a list of the most recent files 
you’ve opened up in Adobe Illustrator. This is a great way to get right 
back to work where you last left off, without having to search for your 
files. Note: At the bottom of the list is an Open folder icon; clicking that 
icon brings up a standard Open dialog box, which you can use to navi-
gate to any file you want.
 
✓ Create New: Here is a list of common file structures to get you started. 
You can also click the From Template folder to load a predefined tem-
plate for items such as business cards, CD labels, and other stuff you 
probably don’t want to have to start making from scratch. Clicking any 
of the predefined file structures (such as Print Document) displays the 
New Document dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-2.
 
✓ Getting Started, New Features, Resources, and Illustrator Exchange: 
Technically, this part of the Welcome screen doesn’t get you started in 
Illustrator, but it can help you get started thinking about how you can 
best use Illustrator. Each of these items is a link that takes you to vari-
ous Adobe-sponsored Web pages with useful information. Good when 
you’re really really bored.

Figure 1-2: The New Document dialog box.

14
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
If you mark the Don’t Show Again check box, this handy Welcome screen will 
never bother you again. But because the Welcome screen is actually pretty 
handy, don’t check that box! If (say, in a fit of rebellion) you do dismiss 
the Welcome screen “forever,” you can get it back at any time by choosing 
Help➪Welcome Screen from the main menu. And then you should clear the 
box, like I mentioned, so this doesn’t happen again.
Before you start a new document, you have to answer a few questions in 
the New Document dialog box about the name, page size, units of measure-
ment, orientation, and color mode that you plan to use. If you’ve gotten to 
this dialog box via one of the links under Create New on the Welcome screen, 
it will be prepopulated with the appropriate values, which you can simply 
accept by clicking OK. The next few sections discuss the various fields and 
options in the New Document dialog box.
What’s in a Name (field)?
You can give your new document a name in the Name field. If you don’t, 
Illustrator names it Untitled-1, and every new document you create is titled 
sequentially — Untitled-2, Untitled-3, and so on, until you quit the program. 
When you relaunch, you’ll be right back at Untitled-1. If you don’t give a name 
to the new document, you get another chance when you save it. The advan-
tage to naming your document is clarity: If you ignore my advice and accumu-
late a bunch of unsaved files (not recommended!), you can’t tell them apart. 
Besides, when you see the true name of the document in the title bar (at the 
top of the document), you don’t forget what you’re doing.
Artboard options
You can set up a document so that it has more than one artboard right from 
the start by increasing the Artboard number to anything greater than “1.” 
After you do that, a bunch of other options become available, such as the 
space between artboards, how they’re laid out, and the number of columns 
you’d like the artboards to appear in. Most of the time, however, you’ll just 
leave this at 1 and pretend you never even saw these settings.
Page size, units, and orientation
You set your page size by choosing a predefined size from the Size drop-
down menu or by typing values into the Height and Width fields. Your page 
size truly matters only when you’re printing your document directly out 
of Illustrator. Otherwise, it just exists as a point of reference — a guide to 
show you how far things are apart from each other. One great thing about 

15
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
Illustrator: For the most part, size doesn’t matter (no, really). When you 
create graphics for the Web, you can determine the size of the graphic when 
you save it. When you’re creating graphics for print, most of the time, you’ll 
be creating graphics to be imported into page layout applications, such as 
QuarkXPress or InDesign. In the latter case, although it’s always best to size 
your image in Illustrator, you can scale the graphic to the size you need it in 
your page layout. In either case, the Web browser or page layout application 
recognizes your Illustrator drawing, ignoring the page size.
Page size is good for two things: proofing and conceptualization. Often, you’ll 
want to print your artwork on paper directly from Illustrator to get an idea 
of what it looks like. In this case, set the Size to the size of paper loaded in 
your printer. While creating graphics, keep in mind the size of the page or 
browser window that you’re creating for: In this case, set the Height and 
Width to whatever the target output is. For example, if you’re creating for 
the Web, you might want to set the size to 1024 pixels x 768 pixels, which is 
a fairly standard minimum size for computer screens, to help you visualize 
the final artwork. Actually, you can change the size of the artwork to be any-
thing you want, at any time, and that’s one of the great things about creating 
in Illustrator. In addition, you can change the “bleed” amount of a document, 
which is how much stuff that doesn’t fit on your artboard will still print. This 
is great for when you have backgrounds that go to the edges of the page. 
(Having this extra “bleed” area results in better looking edges.)
 
By default, Illustrator measures image size in points (1 point [pt] = 1⁄72 inch). 
If that unit of measurement is unfamiliar to you, be sure to select a different 
unit from the Units drop-down menu in the New Document dialog box. Your 
ruler also changes units (when you choose View➪Show Rulers) to the type 
you selected. And although it won’t change the ruler units, you can also type 
the unit of measurement along with the number when you specify values for 
page size in the Height and Width fields. When you open a new document, 
it comes up showing a width in points: say, for instance, 612 pt. If you want 
to specify a width of 10 inches or 30 centimeters, just type (respectively) 
10 in or 30 cm in the Width field. If you don’t know the standard abbreviation 
for a unit of measurement, you can type the whole word out (for example, 
10 inches or 30 centimeters). Illustrator understands what you mean and 
does the conversion for you. And it will do so wherever you enter a unit 
of measurement, not only in the New Document dialog box. Smart, very 
smart!
CMYK or RGB?
CMYK or RGB? In Illustrator, this question is a bit more significant than the 
ubiquitous question, “Paper or plastic?” To understand why you have to 

16
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
answer Illustrator’s question, you need a little more history and some tech-
nobabble. (Sorry, I’ll try to keep this brief.)
Illustrator has been around for a long time, back when putting color images 
on the Web was impossible, and interactive multimedia was little more than 
a buzzword. In those days, the main reason for creating documents in color 
on the computer was so you could print them in color. Color printing almost 
always uses a CMYK process — for cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks 
(the k stands for black because RGB has dibs on b, which stands for blue). 
These four colors, blended in different amounts, produce the full range 
of colors you see in printed material. So back then, Illustrator used only 
CMYK colors because nobody needed to do anything in color besides 
print.
Then along came interactive multimedia — in effect, the “lights, camera, 
sound, and action” for computer users. Shortly after that came the Web. 
Because images used for multimedia and the Web appear only on the com-
puter screen, a need emerged for RGB images. So what’s RGB, already? Okay, 
I’m getting to that: Computer screens create the colors you see by using elec-
trons to make a coating of phosphors glow red, green, or blue (hence, RGB) 
in different intensities. If you’re creating content for multimedia applications 
or for the Web, you need RGB images that look good on-screen. You probably 
don’t give two hoots about CMYK. So Illustrator, trying to please everyone, 
added the capability to create colors in RGB.
Unfortunately, this new feature didn’t quite please everyone. In fact, it 
upset some people quite a lot and left a wake of money wasted, deadlines 
blown, marriages ruined, lives lost, and empires crushed. (Well, okay, 
that’s a little exaggeration, but only a little.) CMYK and RGB just didn’t get 
along.
Printing in color meant using the standard four-color printing process: 
Every image had its own percentage of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, 
so four sets of films were made (one for each of those colors), and the 
final printed image combined the colors. Each set consisted of only four 
single-color plates (C, M, Y, and K), and that’s all you’d expect to print 
out. However, if your Illustrator file contained any RGB elements (even a 
few pixels’ worth), you had big trouble: Three additional films would print 
out — frequently at a cost of $100 or more per film — for every page that 
contained any RGB colors. If you weren’t paying attention, one mistake like 
that could cost thousands of dollars. And a lot of people weren’t paying 
attention because they’d never had to worry about RGB colors in an 
Illustrator file before. (You can bet they did after that!) To prevent this sort 

17
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
of uproar from happening again, Adobe wisely removed the capability to 
combine CMYK and RGB colors in the same document. That’s why you have 
to specify CMYK or RGB before you start a new document. Sure, it’s a hassle, 
but you’re so much better off having this hassle now rather than spending 
money for it later!
So which do you choose, CMYK or RGB? You might think it safe to assume 
that RGB is for multimedia or the Web and CMYK is for print. Okay, that’s a 
safe assumption, but not necessarily the best assumption. If you aren’t sure 
where you’re going to output, pick RGB. You can always change to CMYK 
later if you’re required to, and you’ll be able to print directly to color printers 
just fine that way.
For the sake of your creativity, choose RGB when
 
✓ You’re creating for the Web or for multimedia. In this situation, you’re 
always creating work that’s going to be viewed in RGB, and you have no 
practical reason whatever to use CMYK.
 
✓ You’re creating for print BUT do not need precise CMYK colors. If 
you don’t have to specify exact CMYK values while you work, choose 
RGB. (You can convert to CMYK by using the File➪Document Color 
Mode command before you print. Just don’t forget to, okay?) I know that 
approach sounds like asking for trouble, but I can give you three good 
reasons for using RGB this way:
 
• Some of Illustrator’s coolest features (including many Photoshop filter 
effects) work only with RGB color.
 
• When you work in RGB, you can use the full range of colors — mil-
lions of them — that are possible on the computer. CMYK supports 
only mere thousands of colors. If you’re creating content for both 
print and the Web, creating the image in RGB gives you the maxi-
mum color range possible in both CMYK and RGB.
 
• Some desktop inkjet color printers print well in RGB. For example, 
Epson six-color printers print a wider range (gamut) of colors in 
RGB than in CMYK.
For the sake of accuracy, choose CMYK when
 
✓ You need precise CMYK colors. Some artists who create for print use a 
swatch book of printed CMYK colors. They use only the specific CMYK 
colors they see in the book because they feel (and rightly so) that this 
is the only way to get a good idea of what that color will look like when 

18
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
it finally prints. If your designs have to meet such specific requirements, 
you should always work in CMYK. Some companies specify the exact 
CMYK colors they want in their publications. If you’re working on a 
project for one of those companies, use CMYK.
 
✓ You’re creating for grayscale or black-and-white print. In RGB, shades 
of gray exist by default as blends of red, green, and blue. If you’re print-
ing with black ink, this blending is a hassle because you always have 
to work with three colors instead of one. In CMYK, however, you can 
create shades of gray as percentages of black ink, ignoring all other 
colors (which you might as well do if they won’t be visible anyway).
After you answer the three magic New Document questions (name, page 
specs, and color choice), click OK and behold: A blank page opens, inviting 
you to realize your creative potential, as shown in Figure 1-3. You’re ready 
to start illustrating. If blank-page syndrome doesn’t faze you and you want to 
dig into the good stuff right away, thumb over to Chapter 2.
Of course, you can also mess around with the Raster Effects setting and 
preview mode, but doing so will make your life difficult. My advice is to keep 
these as the default settings.

 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
Exploring the Illustrator Workspace
Between figuring out what the 250+ menu 
items actually do and rearranging panels 
(until you have a tiny little area on your docu-
ment in which you can actually work), you 
might find the Illustrator environment a bit 
daunting. (If you do, you’re far from alone.) 
And that’s after the good people at Adobe 
took out an entire menu from the product for 
CS4 (the Filter menu, whose time has long 
past). The next sections are an overview of 
all the stuff that’s preventing you from get-
ting any work done. (That stuff is what the 
geeks call the UI.)
Illustrator tool time
The Illustrator Tools panel (that alien artifact 
in Figure 1-4) is the place where most people 
start when they use Illustrator. After show-
ing you a whole bunch of tools, some odd-
looking buttons, and a gang of giant square 
things, the Tools panel (as shown in Figure 
1-4) pretends that’s all there is to it. Actually, 
the Tools panel has over 50 hidden tools. 
Select most tools in Illustrator by clicking 
(once) the tool you want in the Tools panel. 
The cursor then changes to either something 
that looks like the tool, or in the case of spe-
cial tools (Rectangle, Ellipse, and others), a 
cross-hair cursor.
The tools live in toolslots, which are subdivi-
sions within the Tools panel. Many toolslots 
contain more than one tool, as indicated by a 
small black arrow in the bottom-right corner 
of the toolslot. To access a hidden tool, click 
and hold the mouse pointer on a tool in its 
toolslot. You then see a bunch of other (usu-
ally related) tools materialize by the toolslot 
that you clicked (as shown with the Pen tool 
in Figure 1-4). Use those other tools by drag-
ging to the tool you want to use and then 
releasing the mouse button.
Figure 1-4: The Illustrator Tools panel.

20
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
 
Drag over to the little bar to the right of the hidden tools in the toolslot and 
let go of the mouse button when the little bar becomes highlighted. A sepa-
rate little window appears, containing all the tools from the toolslot. You can 
drag this window off the Tools panel and place it anywhere on the screen. 
This procedure can save your sanity if you’re constantly switching between 
two tools that share a toolslot, such as the Pen tool and the Convert 
Direction Point tool. To get rid of this toolslot window, click the tiny white 
Close box (Mac) in its upper-left corner or the X (Windows).
 
When you pause the mouse pointer over any tool, the name of the tool 
appears, followed by a letter. Well, no, the letters aren’t grades given to the 
tools for their usefulness; the letters let you know which keys to press if you 
want quick access to the tools. (For instance, press the P key on your key-
board to get the Pen tool or R to get the Rotate tool.)
As you gaze at the Tools panel, notice that it doesn’t have a Close or Expand 
box along its top. One possible explanation for this is that you go to the 
Tools panel for just about everything you do in Illustrator, and it’s almost 
impossible to work without it. If you really want to, though, you can hide 
the Tools panel by selecting Tools from the Window menu at the top of the 
screen. To bring back the Tools panel, go to the Window menu again and 
select Tools.
 
You can hide the Tools panel temporarily — along with your other panels — 
by pressing the Tab key. Although this feature can be unsettling if you don’t 
know about it (if you hit the Tab key by accident, everything disappears except 
your graphics and the menu bar!), it’s still mighty useful, especially if you’re 
working on a small computer screen. You can work with everything hidden, 
press the Tab key when you need to, select the tool or panel item you need, 
and then get back to work unfettered by the things you aren’t using. This 
approach is a lot faster than selecting to show or hide the Tools panel from 
the Window menu whenever you want to do something different.
Panels to suit any artist
Illustrator has a ton of panels in addition to the Tools panel. You might 
think of a panel as something more closely associated with a painter than 
an illustrator, but nonetheless, Illustrator has about 30 of them. Like with a 
painter’s palette that holds the paints she uses most, an Illustrator panel pro-
vides quick access to the most frequently used commands and features. The 
contents of panels are organized according to what they do. For example, 
the Character panel contains commands to format individual pieces or big 
chunks of text, and you use the Color panel to create and change colors. 
Although Illustrator has dozens of panels, you rarely need to have them all 
open at once. When entering text, for example, you want the Character panel 

21
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
open, but you probably don’t need the Gradient 
panel open because the Gradient panel controls 
only, um, gradients. (Go figure.)
You open a panel by choosing it as a menu item. 
These all live in the Window menu (such as 
Window➪Colors). To close a panel, click the X in 
its upper-right corner.
 
Fortunately, Illustrator can both tab and dock 
panels to keep them more organized, giving you 
a wee bit of space in which you can actually draw 
and edit your artwork. Tabbing lets you stack 
panels in one area so they overlap like index 
cards. Docking connects the top of one panel to 
the bottom of another so that both panels are 
visible but take up as little space as possible.
By default, Illustrator displays the panels shown 
in Figure 1-5, docked along the right edge of 
the screen. Notice that some of the panels are 
grouped into sets and offer you several tabs. (For 
instance, the Stroke, Gradient, and Transparency 
panels are tabbed together in one set.) Initially, 
you see only the Stroke panel; the Gradient and 
Transparency panels are hidden behind the 
Stroke panel. To see either of those panels, click 
the tab for the one you want to view.
You can combine panels by any method that you 
feel works for you. To move a panel from one set 
to another, click and drag that panel’s tab from 
one set into another — or out by itself (which 
creates a new tab group). Illustrator doesn’t limit 
you; you can combine any panel with any set. 
You can even put all of Illustrator’s panels into 
one set if you really want to. I don’t advise doing 
so, though, because the tabs would all overlap so 
you couldn’t tell what’s what.
Another way to use panels is to reduce them to 
their icon view by clicking the double triangle 
at the top of the stack of docked panels. Doing 
this results in a column of very nice looking 
icons, which initially have little (if any) meaning 
Figure 1-5: The default set 
of panels when you start 
Illustrator.

22
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
to you, as shown in Figure 1-6. (The 
Appearance panel here is temporar-
ily showing because I clicked its 
icon.) Clicking an icon displays its 
associated panel, allowing you to 
make changes to various settings; as 
soon as you’re done in that panel, 
it snaps closed, leaving you a ton of 
valuable screen space.
Many Illustrator panels have their 
own menus, which pop up when you 
click the triangle in the upper-right 
corner of the panel, as shown in 
Figure 1-7.
Items in the panels’ pop-up menus 
relate specifically to each panel. This 
makes them easy to ignore and easy 
to figure out — after you master the 
individual panel, that is.
Menus with the finest 
cuisine
Illustrator menus are organized fairly 
well. Some menus are immediately 
obvious. For example, you find com-
mands having to do with type under 
the Type menu, and commands 
for viewing your document under 
the View menu. Other menus are a 
little less intuitive and make sense 
only after you start using them. For 
instance, after you realize that any 
one on-screen “thing” in Illustrator is 
an object, you discover that items in 
the Object menu relate to objects. 
Other menus take a little more work 
and experimentation to understand. 
Believe it or not, all these menus are 
arranged to make figuring out and 
using Illustrator as easy as possible.
Figure 1-6: The default set of panels in icon 
view.
Figure 1-7: Panels also have their own menus.

23
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
To use an item in a menu, drag down 
to that item and release. Something 
should happen when you do that 
(no explosions or tsunamis, as far as 
I know), depending on which menu 
item you select. Even the way a menu 
item appears on a menu can be a 
handy tip. For example, consider the 
following characteristics:
 
✓ Submenus: Many of Illustrator’s 
menus have several submenus 
in them, indicated by a little 
triangle to the right of the menu 
item. To access a menu item in a 
submenu, drag down to the title 
of the submenu and then over 
to the item you want to use. 
(See Figure 1-8.)
 
✓ Keyboard commands: Most 
menu items in Illustrator have 
keyboard shortcuts (key combi-
nations listed at the right) that 
can activate them.
 
✓ More info needed: An ellipsis 
(. . .) indicates that when you 
click the item, a dialog box 
appears, requesting additional 
input from you.
 
✓ Unavailable commands: A grayed-out menu item means Illustrator 
won’t let you do anything with that item just now.
Mac and Windows issues spring eternal
Okay, I know some loyalties in this area are fierce. Can’t we all just get along 
for a while? Regardless of which system you use or like, you work in Illustrator 
pretty much the same way. A few small differences are important enough to 
mention, however, especially if you jump between the two systems:
 
✓ The .ai extension: Windows users often need filename extensions 
after their filenames or the system refuses to look at the files. The 
Illustrator file extension is .ai. That’s right, as in aieee! but without the 
eee! Most file types (on Windows systems) have three-letter extensions; 
Figure 1-8: The Path submenu in the Object 
menu.

24
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
Illustrator uses two. Windows folks should save Illustrator documents 
with the .ai extension for maximum compatibility with all flavors of 
Windows. Having the wrong extension on the file can cause problems. If 
you were to put .aif on there, for example, Windows would try to open 
the file as a sound file, fail, and give you an error message!
 
 Windows users are accustomed to using two- and three-letter filename 
extensions. Mac users don’t have to, but they really should get in the 
habit of doing so. For starters, that keeps the peace when you send 
files and lets you instantly identify what the file is. Illustrator lets you 
save files in an alphabet soup of file formats, such as PDF (.pdf), TIFF 
(.tif), EPS (.eps), or JPEG (.jpg). Each of these formats has its own 
unique properties and purposes. When you see .eps on a file, chances 
are good that it’s a graphic created for use in a page layout program. 
When you see .gif, you know it’s a graphic created for display on the 
Web. File extensions can tell you a lot about your files even before you 
open them.
 
✓ Right-click versus Control-click: 
While in Illustrator, Windows 
users can right-click most places 
in Illustrator to display a contex-
tual menu (see Figure 1-9). Mac 
users who don’t have a right 
mouse button can press the 
Control key while clicking the 
mouse button. Contextual menus 
(clever creatures!) are context-
sensitive: They recognize what 
the mouse is near when you 
click and give you options you 
can apply. For example:
 
• Control-click (or right-
click) the Ruler, and a 
contextual menu shows 
up, offering to help you 
change the Ruler’s unit of 
measurement.
 
• Control-click (or right-
click) text, and you can 
change the font, size, and 
a slew of other options.
 
• Click a path, and up come the options related to paths, and so on.
 
 All the items found in contextual menus appear in the regular menus, 
too, so you never really have to use contextual menus. They’re among 
those little luxuries (like a steering wheel–warmer on a cold day) that 
make Illustrator so nice to use.
Figure 1-9: A contextual menu appears when you 
right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac).

 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
Defining the Document Area
Illustrator uses a traditional art board as a metaphor; it’s what you see when 
you create a new file (as shown in Figure 1-10). You have the page you’re 
working on (the Artboard), and the table the page sits on (the Scratch area, 
which traditional artists will recognize as a Pasteboard). When you create a 
new document, the Artboard appears as a rectangle in the middle of a white 
expanse. The actual size and shape of the Artboard depends on what you 
enter for height and width when you create a new document.
 
Artboard
Scratch Area
 
 Figure 1-10: The Artboard and the Scratch area: the first two rather boring elements you meet 
when you create a new Illustrator file.

26
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
The Artboard serves as a guide to show how large your artwork is (relative 
to the page size you chose when you created the document). Many people 
find it easier to create with a specific page size in mind. If you come from a 
traditional graphic arts background, you might find the idea of an Artboard 
and Pasteboard (or Scratch area) reassuring. You can create elements and 
leave them in the Scratch area, ready for you to grab and add to the artwork 
you’re creating on the Artboard. As to how the Artboard affects your art — 
well, it doesn’t. It’s only a guide to help you get your bearings. Elements in 
the Scratch area still print if you print to large enough paper. If you save your 
Illustrator artwork as an EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) to bring it into a page 
layout program (or as a GIF to use on the Web), anything in the Scratch area 
is saved with it.
 
If you don’t find the Artboard useful as a guide, you can hide it altogether by 
choosing View➪Hide Artboard.
For printing a document, you might find the Page Tiling feature a little more 
significant than the Artboard. Illustrator smartly recognizes the printer that 
your document is selected to print to and creates a Page Tile (a rectangle), 
which is the size and shape of the largest area that the selected printer 
can print. You can recognize the Page Tiling feature by a thin, dotted line 
that appears just inside the Artboard if you set page size to the size of your 
printer paper.
Most printers show a printable area slightly smaller than the page size. 
Anything outside these guides doesn’t print. Even so, remember that this 
guide is based on your printer; what’s inside someone else’s printable area 
might not be the same.
Opening Existing Documents
To open any existing Illustrator document, choose File➪Open from the 
main menu and then select the document you want (using the Windows 
Open dialog box shown in Figure 1-11; Mac dialog boxes look a little 
different).
Another way to open a document is by double-clicking the file itself. If you 
double-click an Illustrator file when Illustrator isn’t running, the program 
launches for you automatically. (Glad it’s not a missile.)

27
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
 
 
Figure 1-11: Use the Open dialog box to select the file you want to open.
Viewing Illustrator Documents
Illustrator provides versatile options for viewing documents, including con-
trols for zooming, scrolling, and hiding (or showing) certain document fea-
tures. You can zoom to the smallest areas of your artwork and make changes 
so minute that they aren’t visible to the human eye (and maybe feel better 
knowing that your graphic is microscopically perfect). Or, to get a good feel 
for your artwork’s effect in the real world, view your document at the actual 
size it prints. Or you can view your on-screen objects as their “skeletons” of 
essential points and paths, with no strokes or colors to distract you from the 
true essence of your artwork. A view of any phase is available, from points-
and-paths to perfect printout. Bottom line: You have to see what you’re doing 
to know what you’re doing. Illustrator offers that capability.

28
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
Zooming in and out of artwork
You can view your artwork at actual size (approximately its size when it 
prints), much larger, or much smaller. Changing the zoom amount changes 
only the image’s on-screen appearance — not the image’s actual size, how it 
prints, or its appearance in another application. Zooming is like using binocu-
lars to watch a neighbor violate the bylaws of the homeowners’ association. 
Those unapproved maple saplings (and the sap who’s planting them) don’t 
actually change size; you just zoom in on them from a discreet distance.
The Zoom tool
 
 The Zoom tool is the magnifying glass at the bottom of the Tools panel. When 
you click the Zoom tool and move it over the document, a plus sign appears 
in the center of the magnifying glass. Clicking the Zoom tool makes the 
details of your artwork appear larger in the document window. You can click 
until you zoom in to 6,400 percent (64 times larger than actual size). Note: If 
you print while zoomed in, the image still prints at actual size. Figure 1-12 
shows a document viewed at actual size and zoomed in to 400 percent.
 
 
Figure 1-12: Two views of the artwork: actual size and zoomed to 400 percent. 
The Zoom tool is actually two tools in one. When you hold down the Option 
key (Alt on Windows), the magnifying glass contains a minus sign. Holding 
down the Alt or Option key and clicking your image with the Zoom tool 
causes your image to appear smaller. You can zoom out as far as 3.13 percent 
(where everything is really tiny). Figure 1-13 shows the art from Figure 1-12 as 
it would look at 25 percent of its actual size.

29
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator

Speed zoom ahead
Zooming is something Illustrator users do often enough to warrant the multitude 
of keyboard commands associated with this function. In order of usefulness, the 
following items represent some of the most useful speed-zoom techniques:
 
✓ Use any tool to Zoom In. Press Ô+spacebar on a Mac (Ctrl+spacebar 
on Windows), and the tool you’re using changes to the magnifying glass 
with a plus sign in it. Click the area where you want to zoom in. After 
you release the keys, the Zoom tool switches back to the tool you were 
previously using. This shortcut is really handy.
 
✓ Use any tool to Zoom Out. Press Ô+Option+spacebar on a Mac 
(Ctrl+Alt+spacebar in Windows), and the tool you’re using changes to 
the magnifying glass with a minus sign in it. Click the image to zoom out. 

30
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
After you release the keys, the Zoom tool switches back to the tool you 
were using. This shortcut is as handy as the temporary Zoom In tool.
 
✓ Go to Actual Size: Press Ô+1 on a Mac (Ctrl+1 in Windows) to return to 
actual size. You can also double-click the Zoom tool to do this.
 
✓ Go to Fit In Window view: Press Ô+0 on a Mac (Ctrl+0 in Windows) to 
zoom to the level at which your page fits into the window. You can also 
double-click the Hand tool to do this.
 
✓ Zoom in and out. Press Ô++ (plus) on a Mac (Ctrl++ [plus] in Windows) 
to zoom in one level or Ô+– [minus] on a Mac (Ctrl+– [minus] in 
Windows) to zoom out one level.
 
✓ Activate the Zoom In tool. Press Z to change to the Zoom In tool. If you 
actually read to the bottom of this list, geekiness from someone you know 
is starting to rub off on you. I strongly advise taking a few days off — away 
from your computer (and from said geek).
 
✓ While Zooming: Press the spacebar to move around the current mar-
quee (the dotted lines).
Scrolling around your document
You can use the scroll bars to move around your document, but they limit 
you to moving horizontally or vertically — and only one of those directions 
at a time. If you’re really cool (and you know you are), you can use the Hand 
tool to move around your document in any direction.
To use the Hand tool, choose it from the Tools panel. Then click and drag 
anywhere in the document. The artwork moves in the direction you drag. 
At first, this action might seem slightly awkward — ah! but power corrupts. 
After a few minutes of pushing your art around, you’ll never want to go back 
to those nasty scroll bars.
 
You can use any tool as the Hand tool. To change a tool into the Hand tool, 
hold down the spacebar while you click the tool. Then click and drag just 
as you would with the Hand tool. Let go of the spacebar, and the tool you 
were using returns to its original form. This trick works with any tool except 
the Text tool. If you have the Text tool active, press Ô+spacebar on a Mac 
(Ctrl+spacebar on Windows).
Looking at the guts of your artwork
Typically, what you see in your Document window is pretty much what’s 
going to print (the view in Preview mode). However, what you see isn’t what 
the printer and Illustrator look at. Instead, they see all your Illustrator art-
work and objects as a series of outlines, placed images, and text (the view 
in Outline mode). If you want to view your document in this skeletal form, 
choose View➪Outline. Outline mode is a great diagnostic tool: It helps you 

31
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
understand how a document was made. Figure 1-14 shows artwork in both 
Preview and Outline modes. Outline mode also makes it easier to select 
objects that are very close together.
 
 
Figure 1-14: Art in Preview mode and Outline mode.
Notice that in Preview mode, things like the scribbly swashes between the 
numbered cities and the squiggles and circles don’t show up. That’s because 
those are all Illustrator Effects, which aren’t objects that are defined by paths 
and lines and points and such, but instead are applied to different objects. 
You can learn a lot about documents by viewing them this way.
Using Templates
Few things in life are as frightening as a blank page staring you down. 
Knowing this, the good folks at Adobe have supplied hundreds of templates 
to get you started quickly and easily. Templates, such as the filmy one shown 
in Figure 1-15, provide you with a stylish yet fully customizable starting point. 
Because you can change so much in each template, from colors to fonts to 
objects, your use of a template is sure to be different than your buddy Larry’s 
use of it. And, as evidenced by his questionable wardrobe, Larry has abso-
lutely no design sense whatsoever.

32
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
To use a template in Illustrator, select the From Template option (under 
Create New) in the Welcome screen that I talk about earlier in the chapter, or 
choose File➪New from Template. The template opens up as an untitled docu-
ment. Don’t be concerned about writing over the template; you’re actually 
opening a copy of the original file.
 
 
Figure 1-15: A template for a stylin’ postcard.

33
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
Saving Illustrator Documents
The instant you accomplish something you like, you should save it. And you 
should save every few minutes, even if you haven’t done something you like. 
If you don’t, you lose all the work and have to re-create it if you crash, acci-
dentally quit, or accidentally shut off the power supply to your computer. 
Unlike applications such as Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign, Illustrator 
has no auto-save feature. Anything you don’t save is lost. Just remember that 
old TLA (three-letter acronym), SOS: Save Often, Silly! Saving takes only a 
second, and it saves not only your artwork but also your time and sanity.
To save a document, choose File➪Save. If you haven’t yet saved the document, 
the Save As dialog box (as shown in Figure 1-16) appears. Reward its prompt-
ness by naming your file something appropriate, witty, and deep. Or type 
something hurried-but-meaningful, such as gasdfoiu or jkl23, so you can chal-
lenge yourself later to figure out what that @#*! document is. (Just kidding.)
 
 
Figure 1-16: Name your masterpiece in the Save As dialog box.

34
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
If you’ve already saved your document, the Save command updates the 
existing file. If you’re not sure whether you previously saved a document, 
look at the title bar. If it reads Untitled-1, you probably haven’t saved. (Only 
someone with a creepy sense of humor would pick Untitled-1 as a title just 
to befuddle the rest of us.) Illustrator is incredibly smart, so much so that 
it’s unsettling when it comes to saving files. Whenever you make a change, a 
little asterisk (*) appears to the right of your file name, telling you that you 
haven’t saved the files since you made changes. As soon as you smack good 
ol’ Ô+S on a Mac (Ctrl+S on Windows), the asterisk goes away.
Changing Your Mind
One of Illustrator’s most powerful features is likely strikingly familiar: the 
Edit➪Undo command that gives you a way to take back the goof you just 
made. And in Illustrator, choosing Edit➪Undo can be a multiple undo, 
making you the Master of Time! You can take your artwork back through 
time, step by step, all the way to when you first opened the document! If 
you make a mistake (or several), just choose Edit➪Undo (or press Ô+Z on 
a Mac or Ctrl+Z on Windows) repeatedly until you get back to the way things 
were before they went so wrong. To redo the last thing you undid, choose 
Edit➪Redo (or press Ô+Shift+Z on a Mac or Ctrl+Shift+Z on Windows). 
(A time machine with a reverse gear — way cool.)
Imagine creating with wild abandon — moving points, changing colors and 
line thicknesses, and deleting paths — because in Illustrator, you can change 
your mind after the fact. Think of what you could obliterate from time: the 
misplaced stroke that looks like a bad tattoo, the missed goal that kept your 
team from the playoffs, the blind date that went so horribly wrong. Well, 
okay, it only works in Illustrator. At least it works somewhere.
You can take a graphic back to the way it was when you first opened it, with 
one exception: If you close a file and then reopen it, you can’t go back to 
anything you did before you closed the file. You can, however, save a file and 
then go back to things that happened before you saved it — if you left the file 
open after you saved it. In that case, the only thing that can’t be undone is 
the Save command: You still have a file on your hard drive that exists exactly 
as it did when you hit Save. This method can be useful if you have to create 
multiple revisions of the same document.
Printing Illustrator Documents
If your computer is connected to a printer, you can print just about anything 
you create in Illustrator. Before you print, however, make sure that your 
artwork is within the Page Tiling boundaries (that dotted gray rectangle that 
shows up when you choose View➪Show Page Tiling). Only items within these 

35
 Chapter 1: Introducing the World of Illustrator
boundaries print. The dotted lines on the page indicate the trim area; if your 
image is outside the dotted lines, it won’t print.
To print your artwork, choose File➪Print. The Print dialog box appears (see 
Figure 1-17). Click OK; soon a sheet of paper emerges from your printer with 
your artwork on it.
 
 
Figure 1-17: The Print dialog box has more options than Illustrator 1.1 
 
had in the entire program.
Closing Documents and Quitting Illustrator
To close an Illustrator document, choose File➪Close. The document closes 
without a fuss. If you haven’t saved before closing, a dialog box appears, 
asking whether you want to save changes made to your artwork. To quit 
Illustrator, choose File➪Quit (Mac) or File➪Exit (Windows). If you haven’t 
saved before quitting, a dialog box appears and asks whether you want to 
save your changes. (Consistent good manners — aren’t they wonderful?)

Following the Righteous Path
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how paths and pixels work
▶ Knowing the differences between paths and pixels
▶ Determining when to use paths and when to use pixels
▶ Using PostScript printing and paths
▶ Creating paths
B
eing new to Illustrator typically means being new to paths. Paths are 
the heart and soul of Illustrator — its primary way to create graphics. 
Nearly all computer-generated graphics are either pixel-based or path-based 
(also known as vector-based — more on that later). Getting a firm grip on the 
differences between the two graphics types can help you create graphics of 
any type.
Pixel-based images (created in Adobe Photoshop as well as 
by scanners and digital cameras) use a fixed grid of tiny 
colored squares (kind of like tiny mosaic tiles) to create 
images on your screen. Your computer monitor’s 
resolution is a measure of how detailed an onscreen 
image can be, based on how many pixels the screen 
can provide per square inch. To give you an idea of 
how small these pixels are, every square inch of an 
average monitor contains as many as to 9,216 pixels. 
Even so, monitors have a relatively low resolution; 
they don’t use many pixels per inch compared with 
high-resolution printing, which can require 90,000 
pixels in a square inch or more.
In spite of their astonishing quantity, pixels work just like 
mosaic tiles (or like the dots in a Seurat painting). Because 
images are a bit less distinct from farther away, putting together 
squares of different colors results in a smooth picture when seen from a dis-
tance; the individual squares are, in effect, invisible. The more squares used 
to create a square inch of the image — that is, the higher the resolution — 
the smoother and more realistic the picture is.

38
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
In addition to their staggeringly small size, the range of colors that pixels 
can have is equally astonishing. A single pixel can display only one color at a 
time, but that color can be any of 16.7 million.
Path-based (often called vector-based) graphics are much simpler — and in 
some ways, easier to comprehend — than their pixel-based cousins. Think 
of an image in a coloring book: A shape is defined by a line. Inside the line, 
you can add color. By using this simple method of shapes and color, you can 
create just about any picture you can imagine. In Illustrator, the shapes can 
be any size and complexity, and the lines can be as thick or as thin as you 
want, or even invisible. And the shapes can be filled with an astonishing vari-
ety of colors, patterns, and gradients (even pixel-based images), but the same 
basic coloring-book principle applies.
Whether Paths or Pixels Are Better
You choose between paths and pixels for different reasons. Paths are better 
for some things, pixels are better for others, and each approach has its 
strengths. The key to determining whether to use paths (which Illustrator 
creates) or pixels (from a program, such as Photoshop) is to be familiar with 
the capabilities of each method. Figure 2-1 shows path-based artwork next to 
pixel-based artwork.
 
 
Figure 2-1: Path-based artwork (left) and pixel-based artwork (right).
Paths are generally better for type, logos, and precision graphics. Pixels are 
generally better for photographs, painting-style illustrations, complex back-
grounds, textures, and simulated lighting effects. Quite often, however, the 
proper combination of paths and pixels results in the best final illustration 
possible. Determining what combination to use is a lot easier when you’re hip 
to the advantages and drawbacks of both paths and pixels.

Paths: The ultimate flexibility in graphics
Paths are used to define any shape from a simple square or circle to the 
shape of South America. Because paths are merely the outline of these 
shapes — not the shapes themselves — they take up very little storage 
space. A path-based square that measures 15 x 15 feet takes up no more 
room in your computer than a 1 x 1–inch path-based square.
How can such a large square and such a tiny one both occupy the same 
amount of computer memory? Through math, mostly. Looking at how 
Illustrator draws a square can help you make sense of this. To Illustrator, a 
square is simply a set of four locations — one for each of four points (the cor-
ners) — as well as any Fill or Stroke information (what color the square is). 
Where the points are doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you have four 
of ’em and that they make a square when you connect the dots.
What about complex outlines? A semi-accurate representation of regions in 
the United States of America with a limited amount of detail probably needs 
dozens of points to define the shape of the continent. In this case, there’s 
nary a straight line anywhere: From point to point, it’s nothing but curved 
lines. And because they need more information to describe them, those 
curved lines take up about twice as much disk space as straight lines do. 
Even so, a tiny, little 1-inch-high illustration of the U.S. can be enlarged to 
15 feet tall and still have exactly the same file size because the illustration 
still has exactly the same number of points. Only the math that determines 
the location of those points has been changed to put them farther apart.
Figure 2-2 shows a regional U.S. map next to an orange square that physically 
appears to be about three times as large as the U.S. (well, three times as large 
as the illustration of the U.S.). Which one is bigger in terms of file size? The 
U.S. map is. It has more detail and, therefore, more points.
What’s so cool about paths is something I previously allude to: You can make 
paths much larger or smaller in physical dimensions without increasing the 
file size or losing image quality. You can rotate a path, flip it (reflecting), skew 
it (shearing), or distort it in a number of ways without changing the file size 
or detail. (Here’s the secret reason why: All you’re really changing is the loca-
tion of the points.) This near-effortless scalability makes Illustrator the perfect 
choice for creating logos that appear on business cards, letterheads, Web 
pages, various documents, banners, billboards, or signs.

 Figure 2-2: The map shape is a larger Illustrator file than the square 
because more points are used to define the shape.
Pixels: Detail and realism to spare
Pixel-based images are used for photographs because the fine “random” natu-
ralistic detail is virtually impossible to create in a path-based image. Digitized 
photographs represent the majority of the pixel-based images in use today. 
The rest are mostly Web graphics and other onscreen images.
 
Even a low-resolution pixel-based image can have 5,184 squares of color per 
square inch, each of which can be any of 16.7 million different colors. In a path-
based image, every different color (with a few exceptions) must be defined by 
a separate path. To equal the number of different colors that you can create in 
a pixel-based image, you’d have to draw so many paths that . . . well, imagine 
covering a basketball with confetti, one piece at a time. For this reason, pixel-
based images are the hands-down choice over path-based graphics if you’re 
re-creating the continuous tones and irregular patterns found in nature, such 
as an outdoor scene with a lot of grass, trees, and furry animals.
On the other hand, paths are far superior to pixels if you want to maintain the 
quality of a graphic image despite enlarging and reducing its size. Think what 
you have to do to increase the size of artwork made with mosaic tiles. You 
have to increase the number of tiles unless you can enlarge the tiles that are 
already there. But if you did that, the tiles would be obvious from a distance.
Same deal with pixel images. You have to add more tiles (pixels), or you see the 
pixels you already have showing up onscreen as big squares. And when you add 
pixels, you make the file size larger while reducing the quality (the worst of both 
worlds) because you can’t get away with just tossing in any old pixels.

41
 Chapter 2: Following the Righteous Path
An artisan may be able to add tiles to a mosaic and preserve its image qual-
ity, but a computer is just guessing about what tiles to add (in geek-speak, 
a process called interpolation). There’s just no way to enlarge a pixel-based 
image without reducing the quality. Check out Figure 2-3 if you don’t believe 
me. Look what happens when I scale up the image on the left to become the 
image on the right — look at all those nasty pixels!
Likewise, shrinking the image means throwing away pixels, which also degrades 
the image because it then has fewer pixels available for showing detail. In techni-
cal circles, changing the number of pixels in an image is resampling.
 
 
Figure 2-3: The original image (left) and scaled up (right).
An image with thousands of pixels can be displayed on-screen or printed 
much larger — and with high quality — than an image with only 900 pixels. Of 
course, all those pixels take up a whole lot more storage space on your hard 
drive. Path-based images have no such limitations.
How Paths and Pixels Compare
This is it — the definitive answer you’ve been looking for: Use pixels for pho-
tographic manipulation. File sizes are large but indeed smaller than if you try 
to create the same photographic image by using paths. Pixel-based graphics 
that need to print or display at large sizes require larger file sizes than the 
same graphics printed or displayed at smaller sizes. Use path-based graphics 
to create any type of graphics; their file sizes are typically much smaller than 
their pixel-based counterparts, and you can always create pixel-based graphics 
from the path-based ones at a multitude of sizes and resolutions. A path-based 

42
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
graphic can be displayed or printed at any size, from microscopic to billboard, 
without any change in file size, yet always at maximum quality. And the best 
part is that path-based graphics are easily edited, unlike their “every single 
pixel is a color” pixel counterparts.
A comparison of path and pixel documents
The best way to show advantages of each format is to take a look at the same 
graphic created with both paths and pixels. The illustration shown in Figure 2-4 
is a logo, created with paths, for the internationally renowned comic strip Board 
2 Pieces. The idea here is to use this logo on all manufactured goods associated 
with Board 2 Pieces as well as on signs, brochures, and other places.
 
 
Figure 2-4: A logo for Board 2 Pieces, created with paths.
One thing you notice right away is that the logo is pretty much all text. Paths 
represent text fairly well. A big advantage in creating this logo with paths 
is its scalability: You can enlarge or reduce it to virtually any size without 
changing the image quality. Compare Figure 2-4 (which weighs in at 188K) 
with Figure 2-5, which shows a pixel-based version of the logo (tipping the 
scales at 1.2MB). (Looks like a clone, doesn’t it? Looks can be deceiving.)
 
 
Figure 2-5: The same Board 2 Pieces logo, created with pixels.
If you use a high-enough resolution, the pixel-based logo looks as good as the 
path-based, but its file size is 1.2MB (almost ten times the size of the path-
based logo). Maybe that isn’t a problem if you have a hard drive the size of 
New Jersey, but watch what happens when you change the size of the logo. 
If you enlarge the path-based version (as in Figure 2-4) by 500%, you get the 
image in Figure 2-6.

43
 Chapter 2: Following the Righteous Path
All I had room for in Figure 2-6 was 
a smidgen of the logo — the whole 
thing would be over 20 inches 
square — but note how the edges 
remain perfectly smooth and crisp in 
the path-based version. And the file 
size is still only 188K! On the other 
hand, if you enlarge the pixel-based 
version, you get the image on the 
right. Notice the dreaded jagged 
edges. Worse, the whole logo at this 
size would become the Giant File 
That Ate New Jersey — over 25MB in 
size — more than 100 times the file 
size of the path version!
It is very difficult to create artwork 
approaching photographic realism 
with paths, but it can be done. An image of Venus, shown in Figure 2-7, was 
created entirely within Illustrator and consists entirely of paths.
 
 
Figure 2-7: A close up of Venus.
Although it’s difficult, you can achieve surreal photo-realistic effects with 
Illustrator, such as Venus’s eye, shown zoomed in at several times its original 
size in Figure 2-8.

logo, enlarged to five times its original size.

When to use paths and when to use pixels
In Table 2-1, check out some attributes that are best created with paths and 
some that are best created with pixels.

What Paths and Pixels Are Especially Good For
Use Paths If Your Artwork Contains

Large amounts of type

Often, for best results, you might have to combine pixels with paths (or vec-
tors) in the same piece of art. Fortunately, Illustrator is a perfect tool for 
doing that. The File➪Place command enables you to bring pixel-based art-
work into Illustrator to combine it with vector-based artwork.
Paths and Printing
Illustrator sends paths directly to printers in order to print smooth-edged 
images. This happy circumstance is one reason why Illustrator can make 
such good-looking artwork; most printers are designed specifically for print-
ing path-based images.

45
 Chapter 2: Following the Righteous Path
Dot-matrix printers of the ’80s gave way to laser printers and inkjets, and 
with them came a dramatic increase in speed (not to mention blessed quiet).
Which is faster — a square or a square?
For basic shapes, path-based artwork prints much faster than pixel-based 
artwork. For instance, a 5 x 5–inch, path-based square prints in a fraction of 
the time that it takes to print the same pixel-based square. Why? The printer 
needs only the four corner locations for the path-based square. For the pixel-
based square, the printer needs to see each and every pixel that’s on the way 
to the printer. (Imagine trying to count sand grains with tweezers, really fast.)
Printing paths: The evolution of Bézier curves
Printers create paths in much the same way that Illustrator does — by using 
points connected by lines. Think of a Connect-the-Dot game you did as a kid. 
Instead of processing each pixel, the Illustrator print code says, “Connect this 
point to that point, that point to this one over here, and so on.” All it takes is 
another bit of code to say, “Now fill that shape with solid red” or some other 
color.
This approach works well for objects with (flat) sides, but curves are another 
matter entirely. You’d need to connect an infinite number of dots to make 
a perfect curve. Here’s where Illustrator gets really clever. Instead of using 
straight lines between points, PostScript uses curves between points: Bézier 
curves, named after their creator, world-famous mathematician Pierre Bézier 
(pronounced BEZ-zee-ay).
The idea behind Bézier curves is that you need no more than four points to 
define any curved line: one point to say where the path begins, one point to 
say where the path ends, and two control points in between. Where you put 
each control point (relative to the end points) determines how much the line 
curves — and in what direction — on its way to meet the end point. Figure 
2-9 shows a curved path with the handles showing.
Fortunately, Illustrator spares users the headache of having to work out the 
math; you have a little magnet-like handle onscreen (the Bézier control point) 
that changes the direction of the curve. Okay, actually using it might be far 
from intuitive, but it does give Illustrator the capability to generate complex 
shapes with curves.

46
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
 
 
 Figure 2-9: A curved path (the yellow one) is defined by a path, it’s anchor 
points (on the line itself), and control points (the control points stick out 
from the line).
What’s my vector, Victor?
You often hear the words vector graphics used to describe the kind of art created 
in Illustrator. In mathematics, a vector is a quantity — such as a force or velocity, 
having direction and magnitude — and a line representing such a quantity drawn 
from its point of origin to its final position. In artists’s terms, a vector is a line of a 
specific size drawn in a specific place. Hmm, vector graphics are simply graphics 
made with lines! The basic building blocks of every Illustrator graphic are just a 
bunch of lines. Those lines may have other information attached to them (such 
as color and width). Still, no matter how fancy they get, they’re still just lines 
underneath.
So why not call such graphics line art? Unfortunately, that term is already 
taken. Line art is a specific type of traditional graphic. I could call such illus-
trations Illustrator illustrations, but that term is a little alliterative (is there an 
echo in here?) and not quite accurate. So this book follows convention, using 
vector graphics to describe the kind of graphics you create in Illustrator. 
Pretty soon, you’ll be doing the same!
Gray’s Anatomy of a Path
Paths can be a thorn in your side while you’re getting up to speed with 
Illustrator. At first, points might seem like a necessary evil (with evil being the 
key word here), but the more you know about how they’re constructed, the 
easier it is for you to modify them. Eventually, you might even stop cursing at 
your poor, defenseless monitor.

47
 Chapter 2: Following the Righteous Path
In Illustrator, it’s polite to point
Each path consists of a series of points. These are called anchor points 
because they anchor the path. Another type of point is a direction point, 
which is a point that determines the direction and distance of a curve. When 
most people refer to a point in Illustrator, though, they mean an anchor 
point, which appears only in a curved path. A path has at least two anchor 
points: to determine where it starts and where it ends. (Refer to Figure 2-9.) 
You can handle the truth
For basic shapes with straight lines, points are all that paths need. As soon as 
you want curves on a path, though, you need direction points (also known as 
handles among Illustrator insiders). Direction points are connected to anchor 
points by direction lines. They control how a path curves. Figure 2-10 shows 
the same path but with direction points showing.

Figure 2-10: A path with direction points and direction lines showing.
 
Direction points are invisible unless the curve is selected with the Direct 
Selection tool.

48
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
Handles work like magnets for the paths that extend from points. The farther 
you drag a handle away from the path, the more that path curves toward the 
handle. Figure 2-11 shows a few variations of a path between two points. In 
each of these variations, only the handle on the right has been moved.
 
 
Figure 2-11: Variations of a path. The changes in the curve of the path 
 
occur as the handle on the left moves.
 
 You can move the handles of paths by using the Direct Selection tool (the 
hollow arrow at the top of the Tools panel).
 
1. Click the curve you want to adjust.
 
 This selects the curve, making the direction points visible.
 
 Direction points are invisible unless the curve is selected with the Direct 
Selection tool.
 
2. After the direction point is visible, click and drag the handle.
 
 Figure 2-12 shows a circle with handles showing.
 
Even basic Illustrator shapes use handles to create curves.

In This Chapter
▶ Selecting objects so you can change them
▶ Moving objects in a document
▶ Rotating and resizing objects
▶ Looking at all the really fun stuff, like masks, transparency and blends
▶ Using Illustrator with the Web
▶ Taking Illustrator documents into other programs
▶ Zeroing in on what Illustrator does best
T
he hard part for new users of Illustrator is figuring out what it 
does. The program is so vast and has many capabilities 
that aren’t immediately obvious or self-explanatory. Even 
seasoned Illustrator veterans often discover that they use 
many convoluted steps to accomplish something they 
could do with a single hidden command. This chapter 
is a tell-all exposé of everything that you can do in 
Illustrator (at least as much as I can in a single chap-
ter). You’d need an entire book to cover such a com-
plex program (erm, um, which is why you’re reading 
this). By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a good 
overview of the features of Illustrator and know where 
to look to find the things you need to get the job done.
Picking Up Stuff and Moving It Around
Any time you want to do something to an Illustrator object, you 
must select it first. After you get the whole select-then-do thought lodged in 
your brain, many of Illustrator’s functions come to you much more easily.
Illustrator offers a wide variety of ways to select things, including five tools, 
a bunch of keyboard commands, and several menu items. Fortunately, even 

52
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
if you know only one or two of these methods, you can be off and running 
with Illustrator selections in no time, just like a pro. Just remember that 
using a selection tool enables you to select virtually anything in your 
document.
In Chapter 6, I discuss selecting paths and objects in more depth. In this 
chapter, you discover the basics — all the ways of selecting, from tools and 
commands to menu items.
Comparing the selection tools
Illustrator has five selection tools. You choose a tool according to the type of 
object(s) that you want to select. The selection tools are as follows (I love a 
parade):
 
 
✓ Selection tool: This solid black arrow is the regular Selection tool. Use 
the Selection tool to select entire paths or groups by clicking them or 
dragging around them. If the object you click or drag around is part of a 
group, all the paths and objects in that group are selected as well. (Read 
more about paths and groups in this chapter.) The Selection tool, 
located at the top of the Tools panel, is plain but powerful.
 
 
 Direct Selection tool: Also known as the hollow arrow or white arrow, use 
the Direct Selection tool to select portions of paths — single points or 
segments — by clicking or dragging said points or segments. You can also 
use the Direct Selection tool to select other objects, such as placed 
images or text. Using the Direct Selection tool, located near the top of the 
Tools panel, selects only the portions of the path that you click or drag.
 
 
✓ Group Selection tool: This tool looks like the Direct Selection tool (a 
hollow arrow) but with a + symbol beside it. Use it to select “up” through 
paths and groups. The first click selects the entire path you click. Click 
the selected path again to select the group that the first path is in. If you 
keep clicking, you continue to select groups of groups, all containing the 
group that the first group is in. The Group Selection tool shares a toolslot 
with the Direct Selection tool. Just click and hold the Direct Selection tool 
to make the Group Selection spring out from behind it.
 
 
✓ Lasso tool: This tool looks like an anemic loop of string until you use it 
to select points and path segments within an area you designate by 
dragging the mouse pointer — at which time it still looks anemic. The 
Lasso tool is a go-anywhere version of the Direct Selection tool.
 
 
✓ Magic Wand tool: Photoshop users will recognize this much-beloved 
tool. Use the Magic Wand tool to select multiple objects with similar 
attributes — fills, strokes, transparency — within a specific tolerance 
range. For example, you can select all objects that have a stroke weight 
between five and ten points. The Magic Wand panel controls the various 
attributes and tolerance settings. For more on the Magic Wand, see 
Chapter 6.

53
 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
Illustrator provides two primary ways of using the Selection, Direct Selection, 
and Group Selection tools:
 
✓ Click and release the object or group you want to select.
 
✓ Drag a marquee around the objects you want to select.
 
 Marquee is techno-speak for the dotted line that’s created when you 
drag with these tools. (And all this time you thought it had to do with 
movie theater signage.)
Note: Consider which tool you use to make the selection. One key difference 
between the arrow-shaped selection tools and the Lasso and Magic Wand 
selection tools is that the arrow tools also move objects that are selected, 
but the Lasso and Magic Wand tools do not. For example, if you attempt 
to use an arrow tool to drag a marquee around an object but you click the 
object first, you move the object instead of select it. No marquee appears.
The Select menu also provides a handy way to make selections. All the 
Illustrator selection commands are centralized within this menu. (You can 
find more on the Select menu in Chapter 6.)
Here’s how to tell when an object is selected in Illustrator: Any selected 
object shows its “guts” on-screen — the path used to create the object, as 
well as any points needed to create the path. Text and placed images also 
show points (and sometimes paths) when they’re highlighted, even though 
they aren’t made up of paths and points (weird, isn’t it?). Figure 3-1 shows a 
pair of light bulb illustrations; the light bulb on the left is unselected, and the 
one on the right is selected. Note the points and paths (in blue) that appear 
on a selected object.
After you select an object, you can do any number of things to it, such as 
change its color, move it, transform it, or even delete it.
Moving and transforming objects
To move a selected object (or objects), just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object or objects you want to move by using one of the 
selection tools.
 
2. Using either the Selection tool or the Direct Selection tool, click and 
drag the selected object to where you want it.
 
 Using the Selection or Direct Selection tools to click and drag an object 
that’s already selected doesn’t add to the selection or release the selec-
tion, but this action does enable you to move what’s selected.
 
3. Release the mouse button after the object is in position.
 
 The object is all settled in at its new location.

54
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
 
 
Figure 3-1: The left light bulb is unselected; the right light bulb is selected.
 
Instead of dragging with the mouse, you can use the keyboard arrow keys to 
nudge anything selected a little bit at a time. This trick works no matter what 
tool you selected in the Tools panel.
Illustrator power-users refer to call the other actions you can do to an object 
as transforming it. These actions include rotating, resizing, reflecting, and 
skewing objects. Illustrator puts all these transformation tools together in the 
middle of the Tools panel. Regardless of which transformation tool you use, 
the process, shown in Figure 3-2, is much the same as for moving objects. 
Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object you want to transform, using one of the selection 
tools.
 
 
2. Choose the Rotate tool (or any transformation tool) from the Tools 
panel.
 
3. Click the selected object and drag.
 
 While you drag, the outlines of the object show how the object will be 
transformed after you release the mouse button.
 
4. Release the mouse button when the object’s preview matches how you 
want the object to appear.
 
 As soon as you release the mouse, the object is transformed.

55

Figure 3-2: The original object (left), rotating (middle), and after rotatation (right).
For more in-depth information on transforming objects, see Chapter 12.
Distorting paths
Moving and transforming paths make them look different, but you can tell 
that the moved or transformed path is pretty much the original path in a dif-
ferent position, at a different angle, or maybe at a different size. Distorting 
paths, however, can make them look drastically different from how they look 
originally. (If you’re new to paths, read through Chapter 2.)
Illustrator provides a number of 
different ways that paths can be 
distorted, but the majority of these 
ways fall into the category of effect-
based distortions. These distortions, 
found from the Effect➪Distort menu 
(shown in Figure 3-3), can create all 
sorts of interesting (and some down-
right ugly) effects.
Distortion effects have no “right” set-
tings, but they do produce immediate 
and profound changes to your art-
work. They also all have previews, so 
you can see what’s going to happen 
to your artwork before you make any 
permanent change to its appearance.
Figure 3-4 shows how an innocent path can become grossly distorted in a 
number of ways by using some of the different distortion effects.
Figure 3-3: The options in the Distort Menu.

56
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
 
 
Figure 3-4: The original path (left); then Pucker, Scribble, Zig-Zag, and Roughen.
To use a distortion effect, follow these steps:
 
1. Select your artwork, using any selection tool.
 
2. Choose Effect➪Distort➪any distortion effect (for example, Pucker & 
Bloat).
 
 A dialog box opens, showing the various options for a particular distor-
tion effect. (Figure 3-5, for example, shows the options for the Pucker 
and Bloat effect.) Enable the Preview check box (mark it) so you can see 
the result of using this effect on your artwork.
 
3. Use the slider (a little triangle under a straight line) to set the amount 
of the distortion.
 
 Drag the slider to the left; watch what happens to the artwork (the value 
decreases, and the artwork changes). Drag it to the right (increasing the 
value) and look again — change yet again, but a different kind of change.
 
4. When you get something you like, click OK.
 
 If you don’t like the result from using the effect, click Cancel to exit the 
effect without changing your artwork.
 
 
 
 Figure 3-5: The Pucker & Bloat dialog box.

57
 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
 
 All effects change only the appearance of your artwork — not the art-
work itself. At any time, you can select the original object and delete the 
effect within the Appearance panel. (See Chapter 11 for more details on 
effects and the Appearance panel.)
 
 If you’d like to permanently change your artwork when distorting it, you can 
use the Liquefy set of tools, all accessible from the Warp tool on the Tools 
panel. The Warp tool and all the tools hidden under it can quickly modify 
paths in a number of flexible, mind-bending (and path-bending) ways.
Organizing objects
Illustrator provides many tools to help you organize your artwork. You can 
move objects above or behind each other, group objects, and distribute 
objects to layers for heavy-duty organization. (Read more about layers in this 
section as also in Chapter 13.)
To move an object behind all the other objects in a document, as shown in 
Figure 3-6, follow these steps. On the left, the green polar grid is in front of 
the meeple; on the right, it’s moved behind the meeple.
 
 
Figure 3-6: Move an object behind another.
 
1. Use any selection tool to select the object that you want to move 
behind another object.
 
2. Choose Object➪Arrange➪Send to Back.
 
 The selected object moves behind all the other objects in the document.
Conversely, choosing Object➪Arrange➪Bring to Front moves the selected 
object in front of all the objects in the document. To move a selected object 
just one level to the back or front of a stack of three or more objects, use the 
Send Backward and Bring Forward options. The Send to Current Layer com-
mand moves the selected object to the active layer in the Layers panel. 

58
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
These commands control the basic movement of objects back and forth in 
a document. You can also group a set of objects so that they always stay 
together (and are all selected at once, all the time). To group a series of 
objects, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the objects that you want to group.
 
 Drag a marquee around the objects or hold down the Shift key and click 
each object you want to include in the group.
 
2. Choose Object➪Group.
 
 The objects are grouped. The next time you click any one of them with 
the regular Selection tool, all are selected.
 
You can group two or more groups to form a bigger group, and you can 
select objects along with a group (or several groups) and create a group out 
of them. Then you can group that group with more groups or objects. If you 
haven’t turned into a full-fledged groupie by now, you can group that last 
group yet again with other groups or objects. And on and on until the men in 
white coats put you in a nice soft room.
Another even more effective method of 
organizing your artwork is to put related 
objects on layers. Using layers is like plac-
ing your artwork onto separate sheets of 
clear plastic. Here are some handy things 
to know about layers:
 
✓ A single layer can have as many 
pieces of artwork on it as you want.
 
✓ You can select all the pieces of art-
work in a layer at the same time.
 
✓ You can lock the layers to keep 
them from being selected while 
they still remain visible.
 
✓ You can hide a layer (and every-
thing on it) to get rid of artwork as 
if you’d deleted it, but you still have 
the option of bringing it back when-
ever you want.
 
✓ You can apply appearances and 
styles directly to layers.
 
✓ Layers are created, selected, and 
hidden (and that’s just for starters) 
by using the Layers panel. See the Layers panel in Figure 3-7.
You can do all sorts of amazing things by organizing your artwork into layers, 
so I devote a big section specifically to layers in Chapter 13.

 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
Using the “Hard” Stuff
Have you ever looked at an illustration, and scratched your head and thought, 
“How did they do that?” Here’s a secret: Chances are that it wasn’t that hard. 
A slew of features in Illustrator let you do really cool things with little difficulty. 
The only catch is that you must walk before you can run. In Illustrator, this 
means being able to create simple shapes, color them, and move them in front 
of or behind one another (which I cover in Chapters 4, 5, and 6, respectively).
After you have those skills down, you’re ready to move on to the fun stuff. 
You’ll be amazed at the things you can do with a simple command or two.
Transparency
When you draw a shape in Illustrator that’s filled with a solid color or a gradi-
ent, the shape covers up any objects beneath it. As I mention in the preced-
ing section, you can move the object behind other objects in the document 
by selecting it with a Selection tool and choosing Object➪Arrange➪Send to 
Back. However, you can’t see through that shape to the objects behind it.
Transparency breaks those rules by enabling you to fade away an object 
(from 0%/completely transparent to 100%/completely opaque, or any degree 
in between) to reveal the objects hidden beneath it. Figure 3-8 shows this 
basic transparency at work with a partially transparent logo appearing in 
front of a city image.
 
Robbery
 
Figure 3-8: The Moolaville logo is set to be partially transparent.

60
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
 
Use transparency to see through one part of a shape more than another part, 
or to blend the colors of a shape with the colors beneath it in strange and 
interesting ways. Thumb through Chapter 10 for more on transparency.
Blends
In the 1990s, morphing was all the rage in movies and TV shows. Morphing 
combines (averages) two images together in a series of steps so that the first 
image appears to magically turn into the second. In Illustrator, you can use 
a similar technique — blending — to transform one object into another in as 
many steps as you want.
Blending lets objects change color, shape, and size, resulting in exciting 
effects. Illustrator’s blends are “live,” meaning you can blend between objects 
but still edit them after you create the blend. The objects in between change 
automatically to match the changes you make to the original objects, which 
allows you to tweak how the blend looks but without having to start over. 
Figure 3-9 shows a step blend occurring between a purple ellipse and a 
yellow star. Only the rightmost and leftmost objects were drawn. The other 
objects are an average of the two created by the Blend tool. I cover blends in 
more detail in Chapter 12.
 
 
Figure 3-9: An example of a blend between two objects.
Clipping masks
An Illustrator clipping mask (commonly referred to as a mask by longtime 
Illustrator users) is a path used to hide objects outside itself. For instance, 
you can mask out everything in an Illustrator drawing except for the area 
inside the path so only the area shows — a vignette, if you will. Creating a 
clipping mask, as Figure 3-10 shows, is really quite simple. All you need to do 
is make your way through the following steps.

61
 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
 
 
Figure 3-10: Mask an image with text.
 
1. Create the original image or artwork that you would like to mask.
 
2. Create the art or type that you would like to use as a mask.
 
 The art beneath the clipping mask can be as complex and have as many 
parts as you want. The top path masks all paths beneath it. You can use 
any tool to create this path (such as the Pen, Pencil, or Rectangle).
 
3. Select the new masking object along with the art to be masked and 
then choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.
 
 Anything selected that’s outside the masking path is hidden, and the 
masking path itself becomes invisible. Remember that nothing is deleted 
when you make a mask; it’s just hidden. You can restore your artwork to 
its unmasked state by choosing Object➪Clipping Mask➪Release. (You 
can learn more about clipping masks in Chapter 10.)

Compound paths and shapes
Compound paths join two or more paths so that one path makes part of 
another invisible. Compound paths might sound complicated, but if you’ve 
ever typed anything in any computer program, you’ve been using them all 
along without knowing it. If you want to place art over something else and 
see things through the holes in the art, use compound paths, as shown in 
Figure 3-11.

 Figure 3-11: A large circular compound path is laid over a piece of 
background art (which is visible through several round holes).
A figure eight is a single compound path, made up of three paths. The two 
paths in the middle are holes — areas made transparent so you can see the 
background artwork through them.
As you might imagine, text characters have lots of holes in them, so they’re 
all compound paths. For example, many letters are really compound paths; 
for example, any letter with a hole in it (such as B or O) is a compound path. 
A typical character, such as a lowercase a, is made up of two paths; the hole 
in the middle is one of those paths. To magically transform a bit of text into a 
graphic object made of paths

63
 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
 
1. Select the text with a selection tool.
 
2. Choose Type➪Create Outlines.
 
 The text changes from a text object to a series of compound paths 
(which you can then edit as you edit any other path).
You can make any number of overlapping paths into a compound path by 
selecting them and choosing Object➪Compound Path➪Make. Conversely, if 
you want to turn the compound path back into two (or more) individual paths, 
select the compound path and choose Object➪Compound Path➪Release. 
Figure 3-12 shows what happens when you release compound paths that were 
originally text objects. When you release the compound paths, the hollow part 
of the letter fills in because the purpose of the compound path in the letter is 
to make those hollow parts of the letter transparent.
 
 
Figure 3-12: Text as text (top), as compound paths (middle), and as 
 
compound paths after release (bottom).
 
Compound paths work best when you keep things simple. If you stack too 
many objects on top of each other and try to make a compound path, holes 
might appear where you didn’t expect them. However, if you try to keep 
things to a minimum (use only a few objects, and try not to have more than 
two objects overlapping in any one place), you’ll get splendid results with the 
Compound Paths command.

64
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
Illustrator has also gone one step better, providing you with an easy way to 
create better compound paths — by using compound shapes. Check them 
out in all their glory in Chapter 4.
Flares
Use the Flare tool to create effects, such as lens flares and reflections, that 
are photo-realistic yet totally vector-based (as shown in Figure 3-13). That is, 
the effects can be easily edited — moved and scaled — to produce just the 
right look.
 
 
Figure 3-13: A boring sun (left) gets transformed into a dazzling star 
 
of rays and rings.
To create your own lens flare, first create some interesting art and fill with 
the colors of your choice; then follow these steps:
 
 
1. Select the Flare tool.
 
 It shares a toolslot with the Rectangle tool.

65
 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
 
2. Double-click the Flare tool to bring up the Flare Tool Options dialog 
box (shown in Figure 3-14). Play with the various settings and then 
click OK.
 
 
Figure 3-14: The Flare Tool Options dialog box.
 
 These are the settings used for Figure 3-14:
 
 
Center 
100% Opacity and 50% Brightness
 
 
Halo 
20% Growth and 0% Fuzziness 
 
 
Rays 
Number 15, 300% Longest, and 100% Fuzziness
 
 
Rings 
Path 100 pt, Number 10, 41% Largest, and 42% Direction
 
3. Place your cursor over the place on your art where you want to estab-
lish your light source, then click and drag.
 
 You should see the appearance of some funky lines and circles. These 
are the rays and the halo.
 
 Use your up or down arrow keys to interactively increase or decrease 
the number of rays.
 
4. Place your cursor over the place on your art where you want to center 
your rings. Click and drag.
 
 The distance you drag also determines the length of the flare.
 
 Circles of varying size and opacity magically appear on your image. Your 
sun should now be decked out with a bright and beautiful lens flare.

66
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
 
5. Deselect the flare by clicking on an empty area of your document 
using any Selection tool and then admire the results. If you’re not 
quite happy, select the flare you just drew, double-click the Flare tool, 
and enter some different settings.
Entering the Wide World of the Web
Illustrator is a Web-happy application. Anything that you create in Illustrator 
can make an appearance on the Web in one form or another. Illustrator gives 
you mighty powers to create both vector-based and pixel-based images for use 
on the Web, like the images and logo shown on the Web page in Figure 3-15.
 
 
Figure 3-15: The logo, gradient bar at the top, and images were all created using Illustrator.

67
 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
I devote an entire chapter (Chapter 17) to the Web. Illustrator does all sorts 
of Web-specific tasks, such as creating animations, optimizing pixel-based 
images, and providing a preview of how your artwork looks when viewed in a 
Web browser.
The following is a laundry list of Web-happy things you can do with 
Illustrator at no extra charge:
 
✓ Create images without resolution headaches. When you use a pixel-
based graphics program, you must continually worry whether your 
graphics have enough resolution to display with the quality you want. 
In Illustrator, you can always create Web graphics with optimum qual-
ity because you decide on the resolution after you complete the image 
instead of when you start creating it.
 
✓ Optimize artwork as pixel-based images. You can save your art as 
JPEG, GIF, or PNG images, using the Save for Web command to preview 
how various color reductions and compressions affect the artwork.
 
✓ Export artwork as Flash or SVG vector graphics. Flash (SWF) and 
Scalable Vector Graphic format (SVG) are technologies that enable you 
to display vector (path-based) graphics on the Web. Before Flash and 
SVG, only pixel-based artwork could be displayed. Vector graphics on 
the Web are smaller and look better than their pixel-based counterparts.
 
✓ Preview artwork as pixel-based graphics. If you plan to save your art-
work as GIF, JPEG, or PNG files, you can turn on the Pixel Preview mode 
while you create it. This makes Illustrator show you your artwork just 
like how it’ll look after it’s on the Web. With this mode turned off, the 
artwork displays as close as possible to how it’ll look in print.
 
✓ Apply object-based slicing. Simply put, slices enable you to divide 
your image into pieces so that you can later apply separate loading 
or optimization settings or other HTML features, such as animation. 
However, rather than slicing an entire image based on a square grid, as 
in Photoshop or ImageReady, Illustrator enables you to apply slices to 
objects, groups of objects, or layers.
For more information on any of these topics, see Chapter 17.
Saving the World
Well, maybe saving the world is a little bit of an overstatement, but saving your 
work is arguably the most important thing you can do in Illustrator. And you 
may feel as if you have saved the world when your client mentions — 40 hours 

68
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
into the job — that she needs the graphics to work in AutoCAD, and you say, 
“Sure, no problem!” instead of breaking down in tears. Or when your graphics 
look every bit as good on the Web as they do in print. Or when your computer 
crashes, and you laugh it off because you didn’t lose any work. The key to all 
these heroic scenarios is Illustrator’s massive Save features, all found under 
the File menu: Save, Save As, Save a Copy, Save for Web, and Export.
Save
Choosing the Save command writes the document that you’re working on to 
the hard drive, which is the fastest way to save a file. Illustrator documents 
are saved with the .ai extension.
 
Saving a file in Illustrator creates a not only file that Illustrator can read, but 
also creates a bona fide PDF file as well, so anyone with Acrobat or the Adobe 
Reader can read and print the file.
If you open an Illustrator file from an older version of Illustrator and click the 
Save button in Illustrator CS4, the file saves as an Illustrator CS4 file. To save 
the file to be compatible with a previous version of Illustrator, you need to 
use the Export command.
Save As
Use the Save As command to save the open document to a different loca-
tion from where it was originally, or to save an SVG, an EPS, or a PDF ver-
sion of the file. Using the Save As command also saves new documents that 
haven’t been saved before. When you create artwork for print, Save As is 
the command to use 90 percent of the time; it allows you to save in the EPS 
(Encapsulated PostScript) format. The EPS format is supported by many 
other non-Adobe applications for both the PC and the Mac. When you save a 
file in this format, you’re assured almost universal compatibility in the world 
of print.
You also have the option of saving your file as a PDF (Portable Document 
Format). PDF is great for exchanging files for review and approval processes 
because it only requires that the recipient have Adobe Reader (a free down-
load from Adobe, www.adobe.com) installed. The recipients don’t need 
Illustrator or any graphics program. They don’t even need to have any fonts 
you may have used in the file. Note: If you save your file as a PDF, select the 
Preserve Illustrator Editing Capabilities option in the Adobe PDF Format 
Options dialog box. Then you can later open the file as an Illustrator file with 
access to edit the elements, fonts, colors, patterns, and type blocks.
 
The only differences between an Illustrator file saved as a PDF file (with 
Illustrator editing capabilities on) and one saved as a native Illustrator file are 

69
 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
the extension following the filename, and also the appearance of the icon in 
Windows or the Finder (Mac). PDF creates .pdf files, and native Illustrator 
creates .ai files. Both can be read in either Illustrator or Adobe Reader/
Acrobat.
For more information on the Save As command and file formats, see Chapter 16.
Save a Copy
The Save a Copy command has all the features of the Save As command but 
adds a twist: You can also use it to save all the information in your current 
document as a different file on your hard drive — at a different location and 
sporting a different file format — without changing anything in the current 
file. You can save multiple versions of the same file (say, one for printing and 
one for the Web). Moreover, if you need to restore the file to the way it was 
the last time it was saved using Save or Save As, you have a handy way to 
do so: the File➪Revert command. Revert breezes right past the Save a Copy 
command, allowing you to make a completely different series of changes.
Save for Web
The Save for Web and Devices command, as you probably guessed, enables 
you to save Illustrator graphics for display on the Web. Even better, you 
can use this command to save your files in any of the most commonly used 
Web graphics file formats: JPEG, GIF, PNG, Flash (SWF), or SVG. Best of all, 
the Save for Web dialog box (shown in Figure 3-16) provides a preview of 
what the file will look like after you save it, as well as what the file size and 
download time will be, so that you can manage the delicate balance between 
graphic quality and short download time. You can find a whole lot more 
information on the Save for Web and Devices command in Chapter 17.
Export
The Export command could be called “Save for Everything Else.” Use it to 
save Illustrator files in an astonishing variety of formats — from the common-
place (Photoshop) to the obscure (Pixar). Use the Export command when 
you need to save a graphic in a specific format that you can’t find under 
the Save As or Save for Web command. Here’s where to find every other file 
format you can use when you save an Illustrator file.

70
Part I: Driving People Crazy — Illustrator’s Bum Rap 
 
 
 Figure 3-16: The Save for Web and Devices dialog box can show up to four different possible 
output results for your artwork.
 
To save artwork so that you can open it in a previous version of Illustrator, 
choose the Legacy Illustrator (.ai) option in the Save as Type drop-down 
menu in the Export dialog box.
The most commonly used formats found here are Legacy Illustrator (.ai), 
Flash (a format for displaying vector graphics on the Web), SVG, and Adobe 
Photoshop. Legacy Illustrator (.ai) allows users of older, lesser versions 
of Illustrator to open files you created and edited in Illustrator CS4. Flash 
(SWF) files can be opened and edited in Flash-savvy applications, such 
as Adobe Flash. The Photoshop format re-creates your Illustrator file as a 
Photoshop file, maintaining the features of the original file (such as Layers 
and Transparency) as closely as possible. Chapter 16 provides further infor-
mation on using Illustrator with these formats.
Illustrator can save in a format optimized for Microsoft Office applications. 
Choose File➪Save for Microsoft Office to create a file that’s guaranteed to 
work well in all your Office applications.

 Chapter 3: Doing Everyday Things with Illustrator
Using Illustrator for What It Does Best
Illustrator is a powerful tool, but it’s limited to certain types of tasks. 
Knowing what Illustrator does best is key to getting the most out of the 
software.
Illustrator does anything having to do with path-based artwork extremely 
well and performs beyond the basics with pixel-based artwork. You can use 
Illustrator for page layout, but it really isn’t designed for documents longer 
than a single page. You can also use Illustrator for some basic image adjust-
ment, but that sort of thing is easier with Photoshop.
Any time you want to create art or graphics pieces that need to serve mul-
tiple purposes, use Illustrator. Illustrator’s flexibility in transforming artwork 
is second to none. With equal ease, you can create artwork to appear on a 
business card, a bottle label, a poster, a billboard, television or film, or on 
the Web.
Illustrator isn’t limited to portraying the way things are in the real world. 
You can use it to create things that may have no real-world equivalents. Give 
light bulbs spikes. Create a monster out of eyeballs. Whatever you imagine, 
Illustrator can help you create an image of it.

Artwork

T
his is where you ﬁ nd out about the basic core 
of drawing and coloring inside Illustrator. 
Remember your ﬁ rst coloring book and that crazy 
huge box of 64 crayons your Aunt Shari got you 
for your ﬁ rst birthday? Remember the waxy taste 
of those crayons and the frustration you had at 
not knowing what Burnt Umber was? And remem-
ber the excitement when you ﬁ rst put crayon to 
paper and saw the great artist that you would one 
day be? Okay, you probably don’t remember any 
of that. But you were probably just as excited as 
you are now, with the entire world of shapes and 
colors opened up to you. This time around, it’s in 
digital form and tastes better (even if the color 
names are just as strange).

A
 regrettably large number of people avoid using Illustrator because 
they find the whole point/path thing so intimidating. This situation is 
unfortunate but not surprising. When most people look at artwork, they see 
it as complete shapes, not as the lines that form the shapes. Working with 
points and paths, though, forces you to see your artwork in a way that many 
people have never thought of before, which creates enough of a hurdle to 
scare people away from Illustrator.
Fortunately, Illustrator offers shape-creation tools as a way to get a running 
start to clear that hurdle. With these six tools, you can create basic 
shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, stars, and polygons. You 
can even create graphics without ever having to think about 
points and paths! (Don’t be fooled — the points and paths 
are still there, but the tools create them all for you with 
just a single click-and-drag. Ah, progress.)
In this chapter, you discover how to use the shape-
creation tools, giving you a good foundation for 
understanding and using the more 
complex features of Illustrator. You also find out 
how to combine simple shapes. Although you use 
the shape-creation tools to create basic elements, 
they are by no means limited, especially when 
used in conjunction with the Pathfinder panel — an 
Illustrator feature that allows you to combine multiple 
shapes in a whole array of interesting ways. Some people 
discover that they can create such an astonishing variety of 
graphics with the shape-creation tools that they can bypass more 
complex tools altogether, such as the Pen and Pencil tools!

76
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Creating Basic Shapes
Illustrator has six tools for creating 
shapes. Although you could create 
all those shapes with the Pen tool, 
you’d torment yourself if you did so. 
The specialized tools in Illustrator 
make creating shapes easy. The six 
tools are named for (and look like) 
the shapes they create, and are 
located in a single row that can be 
pulled from the Tools panel by drag-
ging the Rectangle tool out to the 
side, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
✓ Rectangle: Use this tool to make rectangles and squares. Hold down the 
Shift key when using this tool to get a perfect square.
 
✓ Rounded Rectangle: As you might expect, you get rounded corners 
on your rectangles and squares when you use this tool. Of course, if 
you recall high school geometry, you know that a round rectangle is 
a contradiction in terms. By definition, a rectangle is a four-sided 
polygon, with each corner forming a 90° angle. Oh, well. So much for 
Euclid.
 
✓ Ellipse: Use this tool to make ellipses and circles. Hold down the Shift 
key when using this tool to get a perfect circle.
 
✓ Polygon: Use this tool to make objects with any number of sides — from 
3 to 1,000, to be precise — with each side the same length (equilateral). 
You can use this tool to create triangles, pentagons, hexagons, and so 
forth.
 
✓ Star: Use this tool to make stars with any number of points between 
3 and 1,000.
 
✓ Flare: Use this tool to create lens flare and reflection effects that are 
photo realistic yet entirely vector-based. See Chapter 3 for the complete 
lowdown on this exciting tool.
Drawing rectangles and squares
Illustrator offers simple tools to choose from when drawing many types of 
rectangles and squares to draw. Just choose your shape, and use the best 
tool.

 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
Rectangle
To draw a rectangle, select the Rectangle tool in the Tools panel, and then 
click and drag where you want the rectangle to go. After you release the 
mouse button, a rectangle appears.
Square
To draw a square, you follow a slightly different procedure, as I describe in 
the following steps:
 
1. Choose the Rectangle tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Click and drag with the tool. Don’t release the mouse button yet.
 
 This draws an initial rectangle.
 
3. Press the Shift key.
 
 The rectangle snaps into a square.
 
4. Still holding the Shift key, release the mouse button.
 
 Don’t release the Shift key until after you release the mouse button. 
If you release the Shift key before you release the mouse button, the 
square snaps back into a rectangle.
 
 A square appears.
 
5. Release the Shift key.
Rounded-corner rectangle
Draw a rounded-corner rectangle by choosing the Rounded Rectangle tool 
(hidden in the toolslot with the Rectangle tool) and drawing with that instead 
of the regular Rectangle tool. You can make a rounded corner square by 
keeping the Shift key pressed while drawing with the Rounded Rectangle tool.
 
You can access any hidden tool by clicking and holding on the visible tool; 
after a second, the other tools in that toolslot appear.
Rectangle with exact dimensions
To create a rectangle with exact 
dimensions (for example, 28 points x 
42 points), select the Rectangle tool 
and click and release your mouse, 
but don’t drag. A dialog box appears, 
as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2: Set rectangle dimensions here.

78
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Type in height and width, and then click OK. Illustrator draws a rectangle to 
those exact specifications. To create a square, just make sure the width and 
height are the same.
Note that, for any shape that you create, you can always move that shape by 
clicking on it and dragging with the regular (black) Selection tool.
 
Illustrator places the rectangle’s upper-left corner at the spot where you click 
with the Rectangle tool. If you hold down the Option key (Mac)/Alt 
(Windows) at the same time, Illustrator places the rectangle’s center at the 
spot where you click with the Rectangle tool. 
Drawing ellipses and circles
Drawing an ellipse or a circle in Illustrator is a snap.
 
✓ To draw an ellipse: Choose the Ellipse tool and then click and drag in 
the document window. After you release the mouse button, an ellipse 
appears.
 
✓ To draw a perfect circle: Hold down the Shift key while you draw with 
the Ellipse tool.
 
If you hold down the Option key (Mac)/Alt (Windows) at the same time you 
click (but don’t drag) with the Ellipse tool, Illustrator places the ellipse (or 
circle) from its center instead of from its upper-left edge relative to where 
you clicked.
Like with the Rectangle tool, click-
ing (without dragging) causes the 
Ellipse dialog box to appear, as 
shown in Figure 4-3. Here you can 
type in an exact height and width for 
the ellipse. These values represent 
the distance across the ellipse at its 
widest and narrowest points. Typing 
in the same number for both values 
(as in Figure 4-3) results in creating a 
circle.
Creating polygons and stars
Illustrator has tools designed specifically for creating polygons and stars. 
Like rectangles and ovals, you could draw these shapes with the Pen tool, but 
Figure 4-3: Set ellipse dimensions here.

79
 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
having a tool for creating them makes the process easier, faster, and more 
accurate. Using these tools is fairly straightforward. Like with the Rectangle 
and Ellipse tools, just click and drag and then release the mouse button when 
the shape is the size you want. Also, like with the Rectangle and Ellipse tools, 
just clicking (without dragging) with the Polygon or Star tool opens their 
respective dialog box, which you use to specify the shape’s exact size (and 
other attributes).
 
Need to create stars at various sizes with a certain number of points? Or dif-
ferent sized polygons with the same number of sides? The dialog boxes for 
the Polygon and Star tools remember the number of sides and points you 
enter and use those settings for each subsequent shape you draw, even if 
you click and drag.
Pulling polygons
To create a polygon, simply click and drag with the Polygon tool. When the 
polygon is the size you want, release the mouse button. The new polygon 
appears. Because polygons are more complex than ellipses or rectangles, 
you can get all sorts of special capabilities by pressing certain keys while 
you draw. To customize the polygon while you create it, hold down any of 
the following keys while you drag:
 
✓ Shift: Constrains one side of the polygon so that it’s parallel to the 
bottom of the page.
 
✓ Up arrow/down arrow: Adds or deletes, respectively, sides of the poly-
gon while you draw it.
 
✓ Spacebar: Moves the polygon while you draw it (instead of changing 
the size of the polygon).
 
✓ Tilde (~): Creates multiple polygons while you draw. At times, you 
can have so many polygons that they look like one solid figure, but 
each is a separate entity that you can separate and move wherever 
you want. This feature can create quite astounding effects, as shown 
in Figure 4-4.
 
 To use this feature, you must release the mouse button before you 
release the key, or all the duplicates disappear. This works when you 
draw any of the other shapes, too!
 
 By the way, to get the swirly effect, move your mouse clockwise or 
counterclockwise while you draw.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
Figure 4-4: Press the tilde (~) key while you draw with the Polygon tool to produce a
 
 unique effect.
Clicking (without dragging) with 
the Polygon tool opens the Polygon 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-5. 
Polygons use a radius value instead 
of height and width. All sides of 
the polygon are the same distance 
from the center; this distance is the 
Radius value. To create a polygon 
of a specific width, type in half the 
width you want in the Radius field. 
You can type in any number of sides, 
from 3 to 1,000.
Figure 4-5: Set polygon dimensions here.

 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
Seeing stars
To create a star, click and drag with the Star tool. After you release the 
mouse button, a star is born. Stars are even more complex than polygons. 
Fortunately, you also have more keys for customizing options. To customize 
a star, use the following keys as you drag:
 
✓ Shift: Constrains one side of the star so that the bottom two points of 
the star are parallel with the bottom of the page.
 
✓ Up arrow/down arrow: Adds/deletes points of the star while you draw it.
 
✓ Command key (Ô; Mac)/Ctrl (Windows): Constrains the middle points 
(the inner radius) of the star; the outer ones still move.
 
✓ Spacebar: Moves the star while you draw it (instead of changing the size 
of the star).
 
✓ Tilde (~): Creates multiple stars while you draw.
Clicking (without dragging) with the 
Star tool opens the Star dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 4-6. Stars have 
two radii that you can set here. The 
first radius determines how close 
the inner points of the star are to 
the center. The second radius deter-
mines how far the outer points are 
from the center. You can also set the 
number of points the star has. After 
you make your settings, click OK to 
create the star you specified.
After you create a star using the 
Star dialog box, each star you create 
by clicking and dragging uses the 
same specifications, more or less. 
Regardless of each star’s size, it has 
the same number of points (unless 
you change them, using the up and 
down arrows), and the first and 
second radii maintain the same 
proportions, if not the same size. 
For example, if you enter 2 inches 
for the first radius and 1 inch for 
the second, the second radius is 50 
percent smaller for every star you 
create after you establish the set-
tings in the dialog box, regardless of 
the star’s size.

points.

Creating grids
 
 Use the Rectangular Grid tool, which shares a toolslot with the Line tool, to 
create grids of any size and configuration. Double-click the Rectangular Grid 
tool or simply click the tool on your Artboard (the area on which you draw) 
to access the Rectangular Grid Tool Options dialog box, shown in Figure 4-7.
Enter values for the size of the 
grid and the number of columns 
(Horizontal Dividers) and rows 
(Vertical Dividers). You can also 
enter a skew value that progres-
sively increases or decreases the 
size of the rows and columns. 
When left unchecked, the Fill Grid 
option creates a grid without a fill; 
enabling the Use Outside Rectangle 
as Frame option surrounds the 
grid lines with a rectangle.
The Polar Grid tool, located 
in the Line toolslot next to the 
Rectangular Grid tool, oper-
ates in a similar manner as 
the Rectangular Grid tool. In 
the Polar Grid Tool Options 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 
4-8, you find options for Size 
and the number of Concentric 
Dividers (smaller circles that appear within the largest outer circle) and 
Radial Dividers (the lines that radiate from the center of the smallest circle to 
the edge of the largest circle).
Using both radial and concentric dividers creates a spider web effect, as shown 
in Figure 4-9 (right). You also have the same Skew and Fill Grid options as for 
the Rectangular Grid tool. The Create Compound Paths from Ellipses option 
creates a polar grid where every other concentric circle is transparent. The 
effect creates a bull’s-eye target, as shown in Figure 4-9 (left).
In addition to the grids created by the Rectangular Grid and Polar Grid tools, 
Illustrator can transform your background into electronic graph paper. Choose 
View➪Show Grid to show a grid behind all of your artwork. (Note that the grid 
itself won’t print; it’s just there for alignment and spacing purposes).
Figure 4-10 shows a document with a grid behind it.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
To change the settings for the grid, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Guides and 
Grid. The Guides and Grid Preferences dialog box holds options for changing 
the color, style, and increments of the grid. If you choose View➪Snap to Grid, 
your objects snap to the grid corners whenever you move them or whenever 
you create new objects. When I say snap, I don’t mean the objects automati-
cally jump to the grid corners. What happens is a lot more subtle: When you 
drag an object by using any selection tool, it sort of sticks a little when an 
edge of the object is over a grid corner. If you don’t want the object to reside 
at that point, you can keep dragging. The stickiness is just enough to help 
you align the object. 
Putting Together Shapes
The basic shape-creation tools are great starting points for creating more 
complex illustrations because most complex shapes are simply many basic 
shapes put together. You might be astonished at what you can create simply 
by combining one basic shape with another. One of the quickest and easiest 
ways to do so in Illustrator is by using the Pathfinder panel.
The Pathfinder panel has a misleading name. All it really does is combine or 
separate two or more shapes in a variety of ways. You can use the Pathfinder 
panel to join two or more objects into one object, remove the shape of one 
object from another, cut apart two shapes where they overlap, or combine 
objects in many other ways.
To access the Pathfinder 
panel, choose Window➪
Pathfinder. The 
Pathfinder panel appears, 
as shown in Figure 4-11.
Using the Pathfinder 
panel is simplicity itself: 
Just overlap two or more 
objects, select them all 
by clicking them with 
any selection tool (to 
select multiple objects, 
hold down the Shift 
key while clicking each 
additional object), and 
click the button in the 
Pathfinder panel that 
does the operation that 
you desire.

 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
 
Knowing which button to click isn’t always obvious, but don’t worry about 
that. Simply keep in mind that when you want to combine or separate two or 
more objects, you’re likely to find a button to help you in the Pathfinder panel. 
Click a button; if it doesn’t give you what you want, choose Edit➪Undo and try 
a different button. And if you take the time to read the following sections, you’ll 
actually have a fairly good idea of what each of the buttons will do.
The results of the Pathfinder panel 
depend heavily on which object is 
in front and which object is behind. 
To change the stacking order of 
objects, select a single object with 
the Selection tool and choose 
Object➪Arrange. In the Arrange 
submenu, you can send the object 
to the back, bring it forward, or 
move it backward and forward one 
level at a time. To help you get a 
better idea of how the Pathfinder 
panel functions, follow along as I use it on two basic objects (in this case, the 
circle and the star in Figure 4-12). The next few sections show the magic you 
can do by putting a few simple shapes through the Pathfinder wringer.
Shape Modes
Not only does the Pathfinder panel enable you to create complex artwork 
from basic shapes, but all the artwork you create can remain fully editable 
if you press Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) when you click the appropriate 
Pathfinder button. Overlap two or more objects by selecting one with the 
Selection tool and dragging it over another object, select them all, and click 
the button of the effect you want. The Shape Modes buttons along the top 
row of the Pathfinder panel consist of the following:
 
✓ Unite: Groups multiple objects so they’re selectable as a unit but can 
also be selected individually with the Direct Selection or Group Selection 
tools. The resulting objects use the fill and stroke of the object that 
was on top before the objects were added together. By pressing Option 
(Mac)/Alt (Windows) when clicking the button, the shapes are formed 
into a compound shape — meaning they are treated as a single shape by 
most operations in Illustrator, but still exist as two shapes that can be 
separated in the future.
 
 In all Shape Modes, the Expand Compound Shape command “flattens” 
the compound shape into a single path which cannot then be separated 
back into the original shapes.
Figure 4-12: Start with these two basic shapes.

86
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
 Use the Direct Selection tool to edit any path or anchor point on the 
compound shape.
 
✓ Minus Front: Cuts away all selected 
objects in front of the backmost object, 
leaving a hole in the backmost object in 
the shape of whatever was in front of it. In 
Figure 4-13, Minus Front cuts away the star 
in front of the circle, creating four separate 
curved sections.
 
✓ Intersect: Cuts away all parts of the objects 
that don’t overlap, as shown in Figure 
4-14. The resulting object uses the fill and 
stroke color of the object that was on top 
before the objects were intersected. Here, 
Intersect joins the circle and star, using the 
fill and stroke color of the star (which 
was on top before the objects were 
intersected). Intersect also works on 
more than two objects.
 
✓ Exclude: Removes all parts of the 
objects that overlap and unites what’s 
left into a single object (the opposite 
of Intersect). The remaining object 
uses the fill and stroke of the object 
that was on top before the objects 
were united. In Figure 4-15, the Exclude 
command cuts away all parts of the 
circle and star that overlap, uniting what 
is left into a single object that uses the fill 
and stroke color of the star (which 
was on top before the objects were 
united).
Compound Shapes
All the Pathfinder effects I discuss here 
can be combined if applied as compound 
shapes, so knock yourself (and other 
paths) out. If you want to undo your 
compound shapes, choose the Release 
Compound Shape command from the 
Pathfinder panel pop-up menu. By click-
ing the Expand button (refer to Figure 4-11) or 
Figure 4-14: Using Intersect.
Figure 4-15: Using Exclude.
Figure 4-13: Using Minus Front.

87
 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
selecting the Expand command from the Pathfinder panel pop-up menu, you 
can further clean up or simplify your paths by eliminating unnecessary anchor 
points. The compound shapes are flattened and condensed into a new simpli-
fied shape. But be warned: After you use the Expand Compound Shape com-
mand, you can no longer release your compound shape by using the Release 
Compound Shapes command. The Expand feature permanently fuses your 
effect — just as if you had clicked without the Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) 
pressed — so there’s no going back.
Pathfinders
The commands under the Pathfinders por-
tion of the Pathfinder panel are a mixed bag 
of effects. The Divide and Minus Back com-
mands achieve results by cutting away specific 
parts of the image. Figure 4-16 demonstrates 
the results of applying Minus Back, removing 
everything but the tips of the stars. (Now that’s 
what I call minus!) The Trim, Merge, Crop, 
and Outline commands provide the means for 
tidying up your artwork before sending your 
creation out into the world. In Figure 4-17, this 
cleanup crew takes a bow.
 
 
Figure 4-17: Cleaning up and checking the circle and star, using (left to right) Trim, Merge, 
 
Crop, and Outline. In this case, Trim and Merge cause the same result.
Here’s a quick rundown of the Pathfinder commands found under the 
Pathfinder panel:
 
✓ Divide: Breaks two overlapping objects into separate objects. This oper-
ation might look as though it hasn’t done anything after you first apply 
it. However, after you divide an object, you can move or color each 
piece individually.
Figure 4-16: Using Minus Back.

88
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Trim: Removes any parts of objects hidden by other objects and also 
removes any strokes. Like with Divide, this command might not produce 
visible results immediately: That is, you might not see anything until you 
start changing the position of the pie slices of the circle, where you’ll 
suddenly notice that they can move as separate objects. (Refer to the 
first image in Figure 4-17.)
 
✓ Merge: Removes any parts of objects hidden by other objects, removes 
strokes, and merges overlapping objects that have the same fill colors. 
This command functions almost the same way as the Trim command 
does, with the key difference being that this commands merges objects 
of the same color into a single object, but Trim leaves them as sepa-
rate objects. In the second image in Figure 4-17, the Merge command 
removes any parts of the circle hidden by the star, removes strokes, and 
merges overlapping objects that have the same fill colors (which the 
star and the circle do not).
 
✓ Crop: Divides two overlapping objects into separate objects where they 
overlap and then deletes everything outside the boundaries of the front 
most object. In the third image in Figure 4-17, the Crop command divides 
the star and circle into separate objects where they overlap and then 
deletes everything outside the boundaries of the star (the front most 
object).
 
✓ Outline: Breaks objects into separate line segments with no fill 
colors. The last image in Figure 4-17 shows the visible effects of the 
command.
 
✓ Minus Back: Cuts away from the front most object all selected objects 
that are behind the front most object. The remaining object uses the fill 
and stroke color of the front most object. Here, Minus Back cuts away 
the circle from the star and unites what’s left (those four forlorn-looking 
points; refer to Figure 4-16) into a single object that uses the fill and 
stroke color of the star (which is the front most object).
 
If you stumble upon the Pathfinder commands under the Effects menu, don’t 
confuse them with those found under the Pathfinder panel. The commands 
under the Effects menu change the appearance of an object without chang-
ing the underlying object itself. The Pathfinder commands found under the 
Effects menu are designed to be applied to groups of objects, layers, and type 
objects. They usually have no effect on a few overlapping shapes. For more 
on appearances and effects, see Chapter 11.

 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
Creating Objects by Using 
the Pathfinder Panel
By combining basic shapes, you can create just about anything you can imag-
ine. So, how do you actually use the Shape Modes and Pathfinders commands 
to create such complex shapes? (Details, details.) Consider a couple of 
examples — a crescent moon and a sunrise.
Crescent moon
A crescent moon seems fairly simple to draw, but trying to draw one accu-
rately by hand is frustrating. The Pathfinder panel, however, makes drawing 
a crescent moon almost as easy as smiling and saying, “Green cheese.” Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the Ellipse tool to draw a perfect circle (click and drag the 
Ellipse tool while holding down the Shift key).
 
 As I describe earlier in this chapter, let go of the mouse button before 
you let go of the Shift key.
 
2. Repeat Step 1, creating a second circle that’s just slightly smaller than 
the first one.
 
3. Using the Selection tool, click on the second circle and then drag it 
over the first, as shown in Figure 4-18.
 
 
Figure 4-18: Creating a crescent moon.
 
4. Select both circles.
 
 Hold down the Shift key and click each circle with the Selection tool to 
select more than one object at a time.
 
5. Click the Minus Back button in the Shape Modes portion of the 
Pathfinder panel. Presto! A crescent moon appears!

90
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Sunrise
What better way to follow a crescent moon than with a beautiful sunrise? Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click and drag with the Rectangle tool to create a box.
 
2. Click and drag with the Star tool to create a star. As you drag with the 
Star tool, repeatedly press the up-arrow (↑) key.
 
 A many-pointed star appears.
 
3. Choose the Selection tool and use it to position the star over the rect-
angle so the two objects overlap, as shown in Figure 4-19.
 
 
Figure 4-19: Creating a sunrise.
 
4. Select both the star and the rectangle.
 
 Hold down the Shift key and click each object with the Selection tool so 
both objects are selected.
 
5. Click the Minus Back button in the Pathfinders portion of the 
Pathfinder panel.
 
 Voilà! A beautiful sunrise! (Well, almost. Still needs colors and a caffein-
ated beverage.)

Legal Graffiti
The Symbol Sprayer 
(which has the honor 
of being the preeminent 
tool in the Tool panel’s 
Symbolism toolslot; see 
Figure 4-20) is how Adobe 
makes your job of produc-
ing repeating graphics 
easier and quicker. Feel 
like a kid (okay, a bad 
kid) and spray onscreen 
repeating graphics all over 
the place to your heart’s 
content. No clogged spray 
nozzles, no paint drips, no 
fumes. Who could possibly resist that intriguing spray can sitting there in the 
Tools panel just begging to be picked up?
 
Symbols are reusable and repeatable elements that are used in animation. 
Although they can be graphics, buttons, movie clips, sound files, and even 
fonts, in Illustrator, they can be composed of any Illustrator object — vector- 
or pixel-based images or text. Each individual symbol is an instance. The 
beauty of symbols is that although you might have multiple instances of a 
symbol in your file, each instance references a single symbol in the Symbols 
panel, thereby keeping the file size extremely small.
Symbols provide a quick and easy way to create a large group of similar 
objects and an easy means to collectively edit these objects. Symbols can 
be used for most anything, but are especially handy in creating navigation 
buttons; borders; map icons; and masses of graphics, such as foliage, snow-
flakes, and stars.
Using the Symbol Sprayer
I like it when tools, such as the Symbol Sprayer, work the way I think they 
should (unlike the tedious Pen tool). Follow these steps to become the 
master of your personal digital spray can:
 
1. Select the Symbol Sprayer.
 
 Note that the sprayer icon is surrounded by a circle, which represents 
the diameter of your sprayer. (Read the upcoming section, “Setting the 
Symbolism options,” to discover how to change that size.)
 
2. Choose Window➪Symbols.

default library of symbols to 
choose from.
 
3. Select a symbol from the 
Symbols panel, click the 
Symbolism tool on the Artboard, 
and drag it around the page.
 
 A trail of symbols (of the one 
you chose) appears, mirroring 
the movement of your cursor 
while you drag it across your 
Artboard. (Check it out in Figure 
4-22.) Unless you feel the need to edit your symbols or create your own 
custom symbol, you’re done!

 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
Creating a custom symbol
If you’re the creative type, create your own symbol. First create the artwork, 
which can include any Illustrator object — vector- or pixel-based images or 
text. You can even use a combination of objects, as shown in Figure 4-23. 
Next, select your artwork and do one of these three things:
 
✓ Click the New Symbol button (the little piece of paper at the bottom of 
the Symbols panel).
 
✓ Choose the New Symbol option from the Symbols panel pop-up menu 
(accessed from the little triangle at the upper right of the Symbols 
panel).
 
✓ Drag and drop the art onto the Symbols panel.
Voilà! A symbol is born.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Editing your symbols
The other Symbolism tools hiding behind the Symbol Sprayer enable you to 
tweak your symbols to graphic perfection. To edit your symbols, first select 
the symbols with the Selection tool. Note how you select the bounding box 
(a temporary border surrounding objects) of the symbols and not the individual 
instances. That’s because symbols are a unique breed of graphic that require a 
unique kind of editing.
Symbols used in a document are tied to the original symbol chosen in 
the Symbols panel. If that original symbol changes, all the associated sym-
bols in your document change. This ability can allow you to quickly make 
dozens or hundreds of changes to a document. For instance, if you were using 
little stop signs based on a symbol throughout a map you’ve drawn, you 
could change all the stop signs to traffic lights simply by replacing the original 
symbol in the Symbols panel.
After you select the symbols, click and drag with the Symbolism tool of your 
choice. Depending on where you click and how you drag, you will get differ-
ent results. Each of the tools is described in more detail below:
 
✓ Symbol Shifter: Click and drag your mouse to shift the position of the 
symbols in relation to each other. The symbols move around the cursor 
while you drag, creating a sort of ripple effect.
 
✓ Symbol Scruncher: Click and hold down your mouse to move the sym-
bols closer. Hold down the Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) key while click-
ing and holding down your mouse to move the symbols apart.
 
✓ Symbol Sizer: Hold your mouse button down to size the symbols larger. 
Hold down the Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) key while manipulating your 
mouse to reduce the size of the symbols.
 
 You can also use the regular Rotate and Scale tools to rotate and size 
symbols.
 
✓ Symbol Spinner: Click and drag your mouse in the desired direction to 
rotate the symbols.
 
✓ Symbol Stainer: Hold your mouse down to tint the symbols by using the 
current Fill color.
 
✓ Symbol Screener: Hold your mouse down to increase the transparency 
of the symbols.
 
✓ Symbol Styler: Applies a style from the Graphic Styles panel (found 
by choosing View➪Graphic Styles) onto the symbol. With the Symbol 
Styler, select and drag a style from the Styles panel onto a symbol 
instance.

95
 Chapter 4: Shaping Up, Basically
Setting the Symbolism options
Double-click any of the Symbolism 
tools to bring up the Symbolism 
Tools Options dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 4-24. Here you adjust the 
behavior of each tool.
Select your tool icon from the row 
and then adjust its Diameter (1–999 
points), the Intensity (1–10), and 
the Symbol Set Density (1–10). Most 
of the tools provide shortcut keys 
with which you adjust settings while 
you draw. I recommend keeping 
the Show Brush Size and Intensity 
option selected (checked) so that 
you get a good idea of your tool coverage.
In the Symbolism Tools Options dialog box (refer to Figure 4-24), choose the 
User Defined setting to apply the settings within your Illustrator application 
to the Symbolism tools. For example, if you choose User Defined for your 
Stain setting for the Symbol Sprayer, the symbols appear with your current 
Fill color, regardless of the original color of the symbol.
Here are some other handy tips to keep in mind when working with symbols:
 
✓ If you export your file as a Flash (SWF) file, your symbols are included 
in the symbol library of your Flash application. (See Bonus Chapter 1 on 
the Web site associated with this book for more info.)
 
✓ To place a single instance of a symbol, choose the Place Instance of 
Symbol option from the Symbols panel pop-up menu, or click the Place 
Symbol Instance button at the bottom of the panel.
 
✓ To convert a symbol into a regular, Illustrator editable graphic (to use 
either as regular artwork elsewhere or to add/replace a symbol using 
that symbol’s artwork), select the symbol instance and click the Break 
Link to Symbol button at the bottom of the Symbols panel, or select the 
command from the Symbols panel pop-up menu. You can then modify 
the graphic, select it, and click the original symbol in the Symbols panel. 
Then, choose the Redefine Symbol option from the Symbols panel 
pop-up menu. Not only is the symbol revised, but any symbol instance 
on your Artboard is revised as well. Imagine having to change 1,000 
little leaves on a tree if they were regular graphics and not symbols!
Figure 4-24: Control the look of your symbols 
here.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ To take advantage of a pressure-sensitive tablet, select the Use 
Pressure Pen option (only available if a pressure-sensitive tablet 
is hooked up to your computer) in the Symbolism Tools Options 
dialog box.
 
✓ To name or rename your symbol, double-click the symbol in the 
Symbols panel or choose Symbol Options from the Symbols panel 
pop-up menu.
 
✓ To delete a symbol, select it in the Symbols panel and click the Delete 
Symbol at the bottom of the Symbols panel, or choose the command 
from the Symbols panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ To duplicate a symbol, select it in the Symbols panel and choose 
Duplicate Symbol from the Symbols panel pop-up menu. Duplicating is 
handy for making variations of a symbol. (After duplicating, you can turn 
it into regular art on the artboard, modify that art and then replace the 
duplicated symbol with the modified artwork.)

Getting Your Fill of Fills 
and Strokes
In This Chapter
▶ Filling open paths
▶ Discovering how to use strokes
▶ Getting to know the Color and Swatches panels
▶ Using and creating patterns
▶ Applying textures to paths
▶ Working with gradients
F
ills and strokes give life to your artwork. If Illustrator were a coloring book, 
the fills and strokes would be the biggest, best box of crayons ever (only 
better because these colors always stay inside the lines). Better still, they’re magic 
colors. You’re not limited to a single solid color within an area. You can have 
gradients and patterns as well. And not only can you color inside the 
lines, but you can color the lines themselves, make them thinner 
or thicker, or hide them altogether. Best of all, unlike crayons, 
these don’t make a mess when your big sister grinds them 
into the carpet because you ran to show Mom your new 
artwork and forgot to clean up after yourself.
In this chapter, you discover the different boxes of 
crayons Illustrator has to offer, such as the Color and 
Swatches panels, and how to color your artwork with 
them by using the Fill and Stroke boxes. You find out 
how to create your own colors. Rounding things out, you 
get to know the special colors, gradients, and patterns in 
Illustrator, which stretch the meaning of what color really is.
Understanding Fill and Stroke
A fill is a color enclosed by a path. A stroke is a line of color that precisely 
follows a path. To run the coloring book metaphor into the ground (carpet?), 

98
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
the stroke is the line, and the fill is the inside-the-line that you aren’t sup-
posed to color outside of (but you did anyway because you weren’t about to 
let your parents stifle your creativity!). Color is a loose term here: It can mean 
a solid color, a pattern, or (in the case of fills) a gradient. In Figure 5-1, you 
can see a variety of paths with different strokes and fills applied to them.
 
 
Figure 5-1: Paths with different fills and strokes applied to them.
Although a stroke can be any thickness, it always uses a path as its center. 
And although you can stylize your strokes with solid colors or patterns, 
you can’t use a gradient. (Patterns and gradients are special combinations of 
colors; read more about them in the upcoming section “All the colors in the 
rainbow and then some.”) Remember that a path surrounds the area where 
you put the color. This area is the fill because, um, it’s filled (with color).
 
Fills and strokes can obscure the boundaries of your paths, especially 
when you have very thick strokes on your paths, such as the S-shaped 
purple pattern in Figure 5-1. To temporarily hide all fills and strokes, choose 
View➪Outline. This shows your artwork as just the paths, with all strokes 
and fills hidden. You can still edit the artwork as you would any other time. 
The only difference is that you can’t see fills and strokes. To show all the 
colors again, choose View➪Preview.
You have many ways to create and modify fill and stroke color in Illustrator, but 
the quickest and easiest way to apply them is by using the Fill and Stroke boxes 
in the Tools panel, which looks remarkably like what you see in Figure 5-2.
You can change a fill or a stroke, but not both at the same time. You decide 
whether to change the fill or the stroke by selecting an object and then click-
ing the Fill (solid) box or the Stroke (bordered) box. The box you click comes 
to the front; after that, every color change you make is applied to whichever 
one you chose . . . until you choose the other one.

99
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
Some very useful features surround the Fill and 
Stroke boxes. Just to the upper right is a little curved 
line with arrows on both ends. Click this thingamajig 
(the Swap Fill and Stroke button) to swap fill and 
stroke colors. (Go figure.)
 
Press Shift+X on your keyboard to swap fill and 
stroke colors without having to click anywhere!
To the lower left of the Fill and Stroke boxes are min-

Click this Default Fill and Stroke button to set the Fill 
and Stroke boxes to their default colors: white for 
Fill, and black for Stroke.
If you prefer fills and strokes in festive colors, here’s 
the story: Beneath the Fill and Stroke boxes live three 
square buttons that handle colors. Click the first 
square (the Color button) to change the fill or stroke 
color to the last color that you used. Click the second 
square (the Gradient button) to change the color of 
the stroke or fill so that it matches the last-selected 
gradient you used. Click the third square (the None 
button) to use no fill or stroke color at all.
 
Double-clicking the Stroke or Fill boxes summons the Color Picker, shown 
in Figure 5-3, from which you can specify colors in a variety of ways. You 
can choose a color from a spectrum, using the true color field and the color 
slider, or define a color numerically. You can also select colors from the 
Color and Swatches panels, as I describe later in this chapter.

color you want.

Filling and stroking paths with color
You can fill a path with one color and 
stroke it with another, as shown in 
Figure 5-4.
To fill a path with one color and 
stroke it with another, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. With any of the selection tools, 
select the path that you want to 
color.
 
2. In the Tools panel, click the Fill 
box (the solid one).
 
 Doing so tells Illustrator to 
apply the next color you choose 
to the fill (but not the stroke) of 
the selected path.
 
3. Choose Window➪Swatches.
 
 The Swatches panel appears. The squares in this panel function in much 
the same way as the three squares beneath the Fill and Stroke boxes 
in the Tools panel. Click any square in the panel to apply that swatch 
to the selected stroke or fill. (For more information, see “The Swatches 
Panel” later in this chapter.)
 
4. Click any solid-color swatch.
 
 Well, okay, any swatch in the panel works. The ones that aren’t solid 
colors are special colors, such as patterns and gradients — but sticking 
to solid colors is less confusing early on.
 
5. Click the Stroke box (the thick-bordered one) in the Tools panel.
 
 Illustrator is ready for you to pick a stroke color.
 
6. In the Swatches panel, choose a solid color, just like you did for the 
fill color in Step 4.
 
You can also drag and drop color onto your path. Simply drag a color swatch 
from the Swatches panel and drop it onto your path. Depending on whether 
the fill or stroke is selected in the Tools panel, either the fill or stroke is col-
ored anew.
Making a bold stroke
When you follow the steps to color a stroke and don’t see any change, you 
probably have too narrow of a stroke. Stroke widths can range anywhere from 
0 points (pt) to 1,000 pt (18 inches, or about 46 centimeters), as shown in the 
Figure 5-4: Filling and stroking a path with two 
different colors.

101
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
examples in Figure 5-5. If the stroke is too narrow to be visible onscreen, you can 
change the stroke width by using the Stroke panel, as shown in Figure 5-6.

Figure 5-5: The same path with different weight strokes.
To give the path a different stroke 
width
 
1. Select the path with any selec-
tion tool.
 
2. Choose Window➪Stroke.
 
 The Stroke panel appears.
 
3. Enter a new value in the 
Weight field. Or, if you like, 
just choose one from the field’s 
drop-down menu.
Figure 5-6: The Stroke panel.

102
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
You can make the stroke you’ve created dashed by putting numbers in the 
Dash and Gap fields at the bottom of the Stroke panel. Dash fields are solid 
chunks of stroke, while Gap fields are empty spaces. You can also change the 
end cap type to Butt (snicker), Rounded and Projected, as well as change the 
corner type to Miter, Round or Bevel.
Adding multiple strokes to a single path
This power-user tip will have your friends writhing in jealous agony: 
Choosing the Add New Stroke option from the Appearance panel pop-up 
menu places a second stroke on your path. You can make this stroke a differ-
ent color or width, and even apply an effect directly to it. To avoid confusion, 
always check to see which stroke is highlighted in the Appearance panel 
(accessed by choosing Window➪Appearance); that’s the one that will be 
changed when you fool around with settings in the Stroke or Color panel.
Filling crossed and open paths
Sometimes a path crosses itself. For 
instance, a path in the shape of a 
figure eight crosses itself once. If you 
fill this path, the two round areas 
of the eight end up full, as shown in 
Figure 5-7.
Open paths, which have separate 
starting and ending points, can 
also be filled, but the results are a 
little different from what you might 
expect. When you fill an open path, 
an imaginary path connects the 
first and last points of the original 
path. This imaginary path marks the 
limits of the fill area. If you apply 
a stroke to the figure, the stroke 
doesn’t apply to the imaginary path. 
Figure 5-8 shows open paths with 
fills in them. The fill of the paths 
results from an imaginary line drawn 
between the two endpoints of the 
path. (If you look closely at Figure 
5-8, you’ll notice that the blue high-
lights marking a real path are missing 
from the imaginary path connecting 
the endpoints.)

The Swatches Panel
Illustrator stores colors in the Swatches panel for quick and easy access — and 
no matter how fast you grab a color, you never have to worry about splattering 
paint. The Swatches panel comes with a whole set of colors that are ready to 
use just by clicking them in the panel.
Additionally, Illustrator comes with many swatch libraries — sets of colors 
created for special purposes — so if your first-grade crayon box never 
seemed to have enough colors, you’re in luck. You can even create your own 
custom colors by using the Color panel (see the later section “The Color 
Panel”) and adding them to the Swatches panel.
Using the Swatches panel (shown 
in Figure 5-9) is almost as easy as 
looking at it. Select an object with 
any selection tool, click the Stroke 
or Fill box in the Tools panel, choose 
Window➪Swatches so that the 
Swatches panel appears, and then 
click any square in the Swatches 
panel to choose that color. The 
selected fill or stroke updates the 
instant you click the new color. No 
fuss, no muss, no melted crayons.
All the colors in the 
rainbow and then some
The Swatches panel contains several 
different types of color swatches, 
each with its own range of purposes 
and uses. Such swatches are used 
primarily for two purposes: first, to quickly access commonly used colors, 
gradients and patterns; second, for setting “global” colors that you can apply 
in your illustration and then change later, affecting all the objects that have 
that color applied to them. You can even group colors together.
Here’s the lineup:
 
✓ Process color: This is your run-of-the-mill, straight-up color with no 
added bells or whistles. You can make a color for use on-screen or for 
print by mixing varying amounts of red, green, and blue (RGB) or cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). For more information on using RGB 
versus CMYK colors, see Chapter 1. These appear as solid color squares.

104
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Spot color: (Nope, not for creating polka dots or Dalmatians.) Spot 
colors are used exclusively in printing. The four-color CMYK printing 
process can create only a limited range of colors from its four basic 
color ingredients. To compensate, the process can also use spot colors 
of specified inks that come in a particular color. Many companies make 
spot colors, but most countries have one dominant company that sets 
the standards for spot-color printing in that country. (In the United 
States, it’s Pantone; in Japan, it’s TOYO.) The range of all colors that 
a company produces is its library. Illustrator includes swatch libraries 
from all the swatch-producing companies. Spot colors show up in the 
Swatches panel with little triangles in their lower-right corners; these 
triangles have a tiny spot in their corners.
 
✓ Registration color: Registration is a special Illustrator color that uses 
100 percent of all inks. Although it looks like black on-screen, it’s not 
for artwork. Registration (as a color, at least) exists for a very specific 
technical purpose: creating the Registration marks used by commercial 
printers to get things in proper alignment on press. If you aren’t a com-
mercial printer or haven’t been specifically told to do so by a commer-
cial printer, you should never use Registration. Registration looks like a 
crosshair in the Swatches panel.
 
 If you use Registration to color your artwork, you get an unprintable 
sticky mess that will probably stink (chemically, at least), waste ink, and 
never dry.
 
✓ None: This color choice differs from White, which tells a printer to put 
no ink in a particular space, on the assumption that the paper itself sup-
plies the white color. None, on the other hand, is the complete absence 
of color. In a picture, a white object is opaque — it blocks your view of 
any objects behind it. (You can’t see the electric outlet behind a white 
refrigerator.) An object with a color of None, however, is transparent — 
invisible. If you want to use a stroke but also want other objects to show 
through the fill (or let the fill show through the objects), choose None 
for the specific on-screen area you want to see through. None appears in 
the Swatches panel as a white square with a diagonal red line through it.
 
✓ Gradients: Gradients combine two or more colors in a smooth transition 
that shades from one color into the other.
 
✓ Patterns: If you really love wallpaper, you can use one or more objects 
in a tiled pattern to fill other objects.
The icons at the bottom of your panel (refer to Figure 5-9) allow for different 
swatch-related functions. They are, from left to right:
 
✓ Swatch Libraries: This displays a list of all of the Swatch Libraries 
available. There are an awful lot of them available when you install 
Illustrator, and you can use any existing document as a swatch library 
by choosing Other Library from the list and browsing to an Illustrator 
document of your choice.

105
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
 
✓ Show Swatch Kinds: This allows you to filter the types of swatches 
shown; pick from All, Just Color, Just Gradients, Just Patterns or Just 
Color groups.
 
✓ Swatch Options: This displays the options for the currently-selected 
swatch (allowing you to name it and change other attributes of it).
 
✓ New Color Group: This creates a folder where you can organize related 
swatches.
 
✓ New Swatch: This creates a new swatch based on the current active 
color.
 
✓ Delete Swatch: This deletes selected swatches from the swatch panel.
Swatch options for super colors
Swatches are a quick way to retrieve 
colors, but they do more. Double-
click any swatch in the panel to 
open the Swatch Options dialog 
box, shown in all its useful glory in 
Figure 5-10.
The Swatch Options dialog box keeps 
you busy with choices and gives you 
creative possibilities. Here’s the list:
 
✓ Swatch Name: Here, you can 
give the color a distinctive name (such as Maine Blueberry) or change 
its name.
 
✓ Color Type: You can change a spot color to its closest CMYK or RGB 
equivalent. This is a handy option when your client provides you with a 
logo rendered in spot colors (“Metallic puce? You’re not kidding?”), and 
you have to produce an image in CMYK or RGB.
 
 Unfortunately, you can’t go the other way around. Trying to change a 
process color into a spot color doesn’t give you the closest spot color 
equivalent from the Pantone, TOYO, or any other color library. (For 
more about color libraries, see the following section, “Swatch libraries.”)
 
✓ Global: After you select (check) this option, Illustrator remembers 
everything you color with a particular swatch. When you change the 
color of the swatch, everything with the old swatch’s color updates 
to the new color. (Mercifully, Adobe didn’t call this feature The Old 
Swatcheroo.) This feature’s a great timesaver when you want to change 
a color scheme. You don’t have to go back, reselect, and recolor every-
thing — very handy, indeed.
Figure 5-10: The Swatch Options dialog box.

106
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Color Mode, gamut warnings, and color sliders: These features are 
especially powerful when used with Global color. They all work just like 
the Color panel except that they apply your changes only to the selected 
swatch. See more on this panel in the upcoming section, “The Color 
Panel.”
Swatch libraries
Illustrator comes loaded with color choices in the form of swatch libraries — 
sets of color swatches created for specific purposes. (Pantone, for example, 
has several libraries devoted just to spot colors.) The libraries you get with 
Illustrator draw from all the major spot-color sources in the world. A Web 
library provides tried-and-true colors that work best on the Internet. To 
peruse these libraries, choose Window➪Swatch Libraries. If you turn up a 
color that you simply must have, go ahead and add it to your Swatches panel. 
To do that, open the specific library you need, find the color you want, click 
it and then choose Add to Swatches from the panel’s drop-down menu. The 
color shows up in your Swatches panel.
 
Some libraries contain hundreds of swatches, which can make finding a par-
ticular color difficult. Fortunately, swatch libraries have a Find field at the 
very top of the window. For example, if a client wants a logo done on a report 
cover in Pantone 185, just open one of the Pantone libraries (by choosing 
Window➪Swatch Libraries➪Pantone Coated). When the swatch library 
appears, type 185 in its Find field (the empty white rectangle at the top of 
the panel) to highlight Pantone 185C (the C is for coated) automatically — 
you don’t have to press any other key! Click Pantone 185C to add it to your 
Swatches panel, and you’re good to go.
 
If you need to choose spot colors for a project that will be offset printed, 
make sure to select your color from a printed swatch book manufactured by 
your chosen ink company. Never select the colors based on your on-screen 
view of the swatches in the library. Because of many variables, your screen 
can give you only its best match of the printed color. It will never be exact 
and frequently will be quite different.
The Color Panel
The Color panel is as close as Illustrator gets to a real-world artist’s palette. 
You use it to create new colors by blending. Instead of mixing splotches of 
pigment and linseed oil with a brush (and getting half of it on your jeans), 
you move sliders to adjust how much of each component color goes into 
your new color.

107
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
Dissecting the Color panel
The Color panel (see Figure 5-11) has 
several cool features, in addition to 
the color sliders, that make creating 
colors easier.
 
✓ Fill and Stroke boxes: These 
function identically to the Fill 
and Stroke boxes in the Tools 
panel. They’re available here 
in the Color panel for your 
convenience.
 
✓ Color sliders and Color Value 
boxes: You can create a new 
color by dragging these sliders 
to the left or right. The color in 
the Fill or Stroke box (which-
ever is in front) updates to 
reflect the change, as does any 
selected artwork. To specify 
an exact amount of a particular 
color, type a number into the 
Color Value box to the right of 
each color slider.
 
✓ None: Click the None button to choose a Stroke or Fill value of None.
 
✓ Black and White: You guessed it! Click Black to make the color black, 
and White to make it white. (Wait a minute. Was that a trick question?)
 
✓ Spectrum bar: In this little rectangle are all the colors that you can pos-
sibly create. Click anywhere on the Spectrum bar to choose a color. 
Well, okay, the spectrum is tiny; almost nobody picks exactly the right 
color on the first click. Use the spectrum to get a color that’s in the 
right ballpark, and then use the sliders to make the color precisely what 
you want.
 
✓ Out-of-gamut color warnings: When you create colors, tiny color boxes 
appear, warning you whether the color is outside the color gamut for print 
or the Web. (The gamut is the total range of colors that a method can create 
without having to alter any of the colors.) For the Web, the gamut is 216 
colors; for print, it’s several thousand. If you choose a color outside this 
range, that color can shift to another color. The Out-of-Web Color Warning 
is a square of color with a little cube beside it; the Out-of-Gamut Warning for 
Print is a square with an exclamation point inside a triangle beside it. Click 
the square to choose a color within the gamut that’s closest to the color 
you chose. If you’re creating for the Web, you can ignore the print gamut 
warning — and vice versa if you’re creating for print.

To create a new color by using the Color panel, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Color.
 
 The Color panel appears.
 
2. From the Color panel pop-up menu, choose a color model.
 
 See the upcoming section “Modes and models” for more information.
 
3. Click the Fill or Stroke box in the panel.
 
4. Move the sliders of each component color to the left or to the right 
until the color you want appears in the Stroke or Fill box.
Of course, if you actually want to use the colors that you create in the Color 
panel (what a concept), you can do so in a couple of ways:
 
✓ Use the color while you use the panel. Anything already selected when 
you create a new Fill or Stroke color is filled or stroked with that color. 
(For example, you can fill a selected pterodactyl with pteal or pturquoise.)
 
✓ Save the new color for later. After you create the new color, you can 
save it to use again later. Here’s how:
 
a. Open the Swatches panel by choosing Window➪Swatches.
 
 The Swatches panel appears.
 
b. Click the Fill or Stroke box (whichever you just created) in either the 
Tools panel or the Color panel.
 
c. Drag the Fill or Stroke box onto the Swatches panel.
 
 Don’t worry, you won’t damage the Color panel when you drag 
away the Fill or Stroke box. Instead, you get a ghostly outline of 
the box while you drag it away. Release that outline on top of the 
Swatches panel to add the Fill or Stroke to the panel.
 
 After you release the mouse, the color shows up in the Swatches panel 
for you to use again and again! (Pteal pterodactyls ptravel in flocks? 
Who knew?)
With the new color in the Swatches panel, you can double-click it to open 
the Swatch Options dialog box. Here you can give it a name, make it a global 
color, or use any of the options I describe in the earlier section, “Swatch 
options for super colors.”
Modes and models
Mode and model are the Illustrator terms to define color. Color mode is the 
language of color your document speaks — either CMYK or RGB. Color model 
is a way of describing how to form the colors in the mode (color-language) 
your document uses.

109
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
All the colors used in the document 
(except spot colors) exist in one par-
ticular color mode, no matter what 
color model you use to create them. 
When you open a new document, you 
must decide whether to work in RGB 
or CMYK color. (See Chapter 1 for the 
tale of two color modes.) With that 
out of the way, you then get to choose 
a color model for your color mode 
from the Color panel pop-up menu 
(accessed by clicking the small hori-
zontal bars in the upper-right of the 
panel); see Figure 5-12 for a mug shot.
Suppose, for example, that you want a shade of gray while you’re working 
in RGB mode — the RGB color model of the RGB mode, to be more precise. 
Shades of gray are hard to create in the RGB color model, though, because 
you have to drag all three red, green, and blue sliders to get the color you 
want. To dodge that complexity, switch the color model to Grayscale in the 
Color panel pop-up menu. Then you have just one slider to deal with, and you 
can quickly create the exact shade of gray you want.
The Color panel is where you create the colors you need, using a variety of 
color models: Grayscale, RGB, HSB, CMYK, and Web Safe RGB. Each has a 
specific purpose, but really these different colors exist only to help you visu-
alize the color that you’re trying to create. The Color panel enables you to 
mix colors in any color model, but as soon as you apply them, they convert 
to the color mode you’re using.
The following list describes these color models and the best ways to use each:
 
✓ Grayscale: Here, colors express everything as a shade of gray. This 
model is handy when you’re creating a black-and-white printing or just 
want a quick way to specify a shade of gray. Grayscale is measured in 
terms of ink values, with black as 100 percent — the most ink possible.
 
✓ RGB: With this model, colors are based on the three colors (red, green, 
and blue) used by your monitor to generate all the colors that you see 
on-screen. These colors are designed for on-screen use, such as graphics 
for the Web or for video. The amounts that you see in the Color Value 
boxes range from 0–255. They correspond to the intensity of the light 
projected by your computer screen. Computer screens use tiny red, 
green, and blue phosphors that glow with different intensities to create 
the colors that you see. The higher the value, the brighter the glow. 
Specifying 255 for all colors gives you pure white; a 0 value for all colors 
gives you pitch black. These numbers, however, are less important than 
Figure 5-12: Different color models within the 
Color panel pop-up menu.

110
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
your practical results. Pay attention to the Fill or Stroke boxes when you 
drag the sliders and see the color that results.
 
✓ HSB: Here, colors are seen in terms of hue, saturation, and brightness. 
Think of an HSB color in terms of a crayon. Hue is the color of the crayon, 
such as red. Saturation is how red that crayon is, such as brick red 
versus cherry red. Brightness is equivalent to how hard you press down 
when you use that crayon. This way of thinking might seem weird, but 
many painters and traditional artists find it very intuitive.
 
✓ CMYK: In this model, colors are based on the four colors (cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black) used in process printing. (Cyan is a light, bright blue; 
magenta is a bright purple color that’s almost pink. You’re on your own 
for yellow and black.) CMYK colors are designed to specify colors for 
print. Process printing enables people to achieve a wide variety of colors 
(including photographic-looking images) using only those four colors.
 
 CMYK colors work the opposite of how RGB colors work: The more of 
each individual color, the darker the total color becomes. For instance, 0 
percent of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black results in white; 100 percent 
of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black results in black. But nobody who 
knows better would ever create black for print by using 100 percent of 
all four colors — that would put way too much ink on the paper, result-
ing in a sticky mess.
 
 Well, okay, in theory you could create black by using 100 percent of 
cyan, magenta, and yellow. However, printing inks (for the most part) 
are designed to be partially transparent, so they mix together better. The 
result would be a dark gray mess, not a crisp black. To create a black that 
really looks black, you have to add black to cyan, magenta, and yellow 
(fortunately, black ink is cheaper than those colors). Try using 100 per-
cent black for black, adding just a little of the other three colors to make it 
look really black. (Such complications of even a basic concept may have 
driven some folks to make graphics only for the Web.)
 
✓ Web Safe RGB: Most folks are probably used to working with the 16.7 
million colors that most computer monitors can display these days. 
Of those colors, however, only 216 of them display consistently on 
Windows, UNIX, and Macintosh computers. This reduced range of color 
is because of differences in operating systems, Web browsers, and color 
cards. Colors outside this range of 216 can dither when displayed on a 
system that can’t really show them properly. Dithering is the computer’s 
attempt to create the missing colors by using dots of two colors it can 
display, creating an optical illusion that the missing color is there. 
Dithering usually looks awful. (See Bonus Chapter 1 on the Web site 
associated with this book for more on dithering.)
 
 Use Web Safe RGB when you need colors that look their best on as many 
different computers and browsers as possible. (A corporate logo is a 
classic example.)

111
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
 
✓ Hide Options, Invert, and Complement: The remaining choices in the 
Color panel pop-up menu aren’t color models at all.
 
 Hide Options collapses the Color panel so that just the Spectrum, 
Black and White, and None options show.
 
 The Invert command changes the selected color into its opposite, 
as if you had taken a color photograph of it and were looking at a 
negative.
 
 To understand Complement, think back to art class and the color 
wheel: Complementary colors are the colors on opposite sides of 
the color wheel. (Orange, for example, is the complementary color 
to blue. Roughly, blue never looks bluer than when it’s next to 
orange, and vice versa.) Put another way, choosing Complement 
chooses the one color that will contrast the most with the cur-
rently selected artwork. Figure 5-13 shows both inverse and com-
plement colors of a single color.

Filling with Patterns and Textures
You can fill and stroke any path with a pattern. Patterns fill areas with 
repeating artwork.
Applying patterns to paths
To fill a path with a pattern, select the path, make sure the Fill box is active 
by clicking it in the Tools panel, and then click the pattern you want to use in 
the Swatches panel. The path fills with the pattern you selected. Figure 5-14 
shows the same path filled with different patterns.
 
 
Figure 5-14: The same path with several different pattern fills.

113
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
You can apply a pattern to a stroke as well as to a fill. Applying a pattern is 
exactly like applying a solid color. (See the section, “The Swatches Panel,” 
earlier in this chapter.) Click the object, click the Fill or Stroke box to put 
the pattern in the proper place, and then click the pattern swatch in the 
Swatches panel. When you apply a pattern to a stroke, you might need to 
make the stroke extra thick for the pattern to be visible. (See the section, 
“Making a bold stroke,” earlier in this chapter.)
Making patterns
You can easily turn most path-based artwork into a pattern (which hotly pur-
sues the steps required to create a pattern out of paths).
To create a pattern out of paths, just follow these steps:
 
1. Create the artwork that you want to use for a pattern.
 
 For this example, I use a US flag.
 
2. Select the artwork by using any 
of the selection tools.
 
3. Drag the artwork from the 
Document window onto the 
Swatches panel and release the 
mouse button.
 
 A new swatch appears in the 
Swatches panel containing a very 
tiny version of your artwork.
 
4. To name the new swatch — a 
good idea if you want to iden-
tify it with relative ease later — 
double-click the swatch to open 
the Swatch Options dialog box.
 
5. Enter the name of the pattern 
into the Name field.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The custom pattern appears in 
the Swatches dialog box.
 
7. Apply your custom pattern to any path.
 
 Check out how much I obviously love America in Figure 5-15.
 
Occasionally, you might want to space out your pattern artwork so that the 
repeated pieces of artwork are farther away from each other. You can easily 
trick Illustrator into doing this by drawing an invisible rectangle (a rectangle 
with a fill and stroke of None) over the artwork you’re using as the basis for 
your pattern. The bigger the rectangle, the farther apart the repeated pieces 
Figure 5-15: Creating a pattern from vector art 
of a flag.

114
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
are. Select the artwork and the rectangle before you make your pattern. 
Illustrator isn’t quite smart enough to realize that the rectangle is invisible. 
The program sees only the paths that make the rectangle and repeats the art-
work based on those edges.
Using the Gradient Fill
You can fill paths with gradients, which are colors that smoothly blend from 
one to another. Gradients can have any number of colors in them, with 
results that are nothing short of astonishing. Figure 5-16 shows three paths 
with gradient fills.
 
 
Figure 5-16: Path objects with gradient fills.
Filling a path with a gradient involves two steps: creating the gradient and 
then applying it to a path. However, you can do this in any order. Often, it’s 
easier to create a gradient, apply it to a path, and then continue to tweak 
it by changing, adding, or removing colors or by modifying the position 
or angle of the gradient. You can see how the gradient looks on an object 
instead of just in a small box.
To fill a path with a gradient, select the path and then click a gradient in the 
Swatches panel. The object fills with a gradient that probably doesn’t look a 
thing like what you want — but that’s okay. By using the Gradient tool and 
the Gradient panel, you can tweak this gradient to your heart’s content.
You can also load gradients from the Swatches panel. Illustrator comes with 
all sorts of Gradient swatch libraries with dozens of different swatches to get 
you started.
The Gradient tool
 
 The Gradient tool (shown in the margin) doesn’t actually create anything. 
Instead, it enables you to set a gradient’s direction as well as its duration — 

115
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
the distance across which the gradient makes its transition from the start 
color to the end color.
To use the Gradient tool, first use any selection tool to select an object 
that’s filled with a gradient. Then click and drag across the gradient with the 
Gradient tool and release the mouse button when you get to the other side. 
The direction that you drag sets the direction of the blend. You see a bar 
showing the direction and angle of the gradient (and a circle if you’re using 
a radial gradient). The place where you click gets 100 percent of the start 
color; the place where you release gets 100 percent of the end color. The gra-
dient happens as a smooth blend between those two points (as you can see 
in Figure 5-17).
 
 
 Figure 5-17: Left: The square shows a default gradient applied. Center: Clicking and dragging 
with the Gradient tool. Right: The result.
Modifying gradients
If you don’t like the colors of your gradient, you 
don’t have to settle for the gradients that come in 
the Swatches panel. You can either change, add, 
or remove colors; and/or change how the colors 
behave directly on the object with the Gradient 
tool or use the Gradient panel (by choosing 
Window➪Gradient) to do the same actions. (See 
Figure 5-18.)
 
The Gradient panel looks simple compared with 
other panels, but don’t be deceived. In spite of 
its humble appearance, this panel lets you create 
just about any gradient you could ever want. The 
Gradient panel works with the Color panel and 
the Swatches panel, so keep both those panels 
open whenever you edit a gradient.
Gradient sliders
Midpoint sliders
Figure 5-18: Control color from 
the Gradient panel.

116
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
The gradient sliders slide left and right. You use them to change how gradu-
ally (or not-so-gradually) your colors blend with each other. If you want the 
colors to blend without much nuance over a short distance, drag the slid-
ers closer together. If you want the colors to blend more gradually across a 
longer distance, move the sliders farther apart.
Whenever you select a gradient slider, you can change its opacity in the 
Opacity field below the slider. In addition, you can specify the exact location 
of the slider in terms of left-to-right percentage in the Location field.
 
You can do most activities that the Gradient panel allows you to do directly 
on a selected object when the Gradient tool is selected. However, some-
times the angle or size of the object makes it difficult to use the tool for 
these purposes. As a rule, the smaller the object, the more you’ll want 
to use the Gradient panel instead of editing the gradient directly on the 
object.
Gradient-mania: Color-
tweaking made simple
When you change a gradient in the 
Gradient panel, selected objects that 
are filled with that gradient update 
to reflect that change. You can see 
what’s going on with the gradient 
more easily if you make an object 
and fill it with the gradient before 
you start making changes in the 
panel.
To change gradient colors, here’s the 
highly artistic approach (no smock needed):
 
1. Double-click one of the gradient sliders beneath the 
gradient bar.
 
 The color associated with the slider appears in a mini Color panel right 
next to the slider, as shown in Figure 5-19.
 
2. Choose a different color in the mini Color panel.
 
 The color updates in the Gradient panel automatically. Is that slick or 
what?
 
 As an alternative, you can click any solid color in the Swatches 
panel and drag it to the Gradient slider in the Gradient panel. You 
can also press Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) and simply click a solid 
color swatch in the Swatches panel. The gradient updates with the 
new color.
Figure 5-19: The mini Color panel that appears 
when you double-click a gradient slider.

117
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Fill of Fills and Strokes
Adding colors to the gradient is a lot easier than going to the paint store. Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click beneath the gradient bar where there isn’t any gradient slider.
 
 A new slider appears where you click.
 
2. Change the color of the new slider in the Color panel, double click on 
it to access the mini color panel or press Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) 
and then click a solid color in the Swatches panel.
 
3. (Optional) Adjust the position of your gradient sliders.
 
To remove a color, click the gradient slider and drag it off the Gradient 
panel. To save the gradient, drag the gradient swatch from the Gradient panel 
(or from the Fill box in the Tools panel) to the Swatches panel. You can also 
simply click the New Swatch button (a dog-eared page icon) in the Swatches 
panel.
Between every pair of gradient sliders (on top of the gradient bar) is a mid-
point slider. This sets the point at which the two colors blend at 50 percent 
of each color. You can also move this point by dragging it to the left or to the 
right. Figure 5-20 gives you a look at ways to change the gradient.
Radial: The secret gradient
If you click the gradient swatches in the Swatches panel, you might notice that 
some gradients look like spheres or sunbursts — radial gradients. No amount 
of clicking and dragging with the Gradient tool — and no amount of moving 
gradient sliders — can make a radial gradient from the default Linear style.
 
 
Figure 5-20: First, moving the sliders closer together. Second, adding new color sliders. 
 
Third, moving the gradient midpoint.

118
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
The trick is in a hidden option in 
the Gradient panel. Click the little 
triangle in the upper right of the 
Gradient panel. The Gradient panel 
pop-up menu, with only one item 
(Show Options), appears. Choose 
this option to make several more 
options appear in the panel. The 
one you want is the Type option, 
which reveals two choices: Linear 
and Radial. Choose Radial. The 
beginning color is the center color. 
When you click and drag, the spot 
where you click sets the center of 
the gradient. Figure 5-21 shows the 
same gradient from Figure 5-16 in 
radial gradient form.

T
o change — edit — a path in Illustrator, you have to first select it. In fact, 
99 percent of the time, you can’t make any changes at all to a path unless 
it’s selected. Some exceptions are when you change Document Color 
Mode (see Chapter 1) and when you use the Pen tool to continue 
on an existing path (see Chapter 7). Every other action, 
though, requires that you make a selection first.
As I talk about earlier, making a selection in Illustrator 
says, “From this moment forward, I want to change 
this part of the artwork and nothing else.” You’re 
targeting a point, a path, an object, or objects for 
change. And with Illustrator’s wide variety of selec-
tion tools and commands, you can target every-
thing from a single point to your entire document. 
Changes you make — size, rotation, fill or stroke 
colors, and so on — simultaneously affect everything 
that you select. (If the term path makes you visualize 
a narrow walkway through a forest instead of a line with 
little dots and squares on it, head back to Chapter 2 for a 
quick refresher.)
This chapter tells you what you can do with those paths, as in how to 
select them and how to make changes to them.

120
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Selecting with the Illustrator Tools
Suppose you create a mondo-cool logo. With Illustrator, you can select
 
✓ The entire logo
 
✓ Any group of paths within the logo
 
✓ Any single path within the logo
 
✓ Any portion of any path or paths
All these possibilities might make selecting 
in Illustrator seem rather daunting. As if that 
weren’t enough, Illustrator gives you five dif-
ferent selection tools: namely, Selection, Direct 
Selection, Group Selection, Lasso, and Magic 
Wand. (I also talk about these a bit in Chapter 3.) 
See Figure 6-1.
 
Compared with Selection, the names of the other 
selection tools aren’t quite as accurate in describ-
ing their functions, but hey — Selection tool was 
already taken. To keep the confusion to a mini-
mum, I call the tools by their Adobe-given names. 
That way, you know what the cute label refers to when you pause the cursor 
over a tool in the Tools panel and see the name in the ToolTip.
The following sections describe these tools and what happens when you use 
them.
Figure 6-1: Illustrator has all 
sorts of selection tools.
Two oddities of selecting in Illustrator
When selecting in Illustrator, here are a couple 
of oddities.
 ✓ When you select just a point on a path, the 
point is all that you’ve selected. It shows up 
solid, but the rest of the points on the path 
remain unselected and show up as hollow. 
Then things get weird. Even though only one 
point is selected, any change that you make 
to the fill or stroke affects the entire path. 
(For more information on fills and strokes, 
see Chapter 5.)
 ✓ When you select a line segment, Illustrator 
never shows you that the line segment is 
selected. If you click a segment, all the points 
on its path show as unselected (hollow). 
Nothing appears on-screen to indicate that 
only the segment is selected — but once 
again, changing the fill or stroke affects the 
entire path.

121
 Chapter 6: Selecting and Editing Paths
Natural selection
Of the five selection tools in Illustrator, the Selection tool is (more or less) 
the main selection tool. It simply selects whatever you click. 
 
 You use the Selection tool to select objects or groups of objects. When you 
click a path, you select the entire path. If the path is part of a group, you 
automatically select that group as well. A group is two or more separate 
objects that are joined by choosing Object➪Group. You join objects into a 
group to get the advantage of selecting them all at once when you use the 
Selection tool to select them — and that saves all that tedious clicking. (The 
Object➪Group command is just one of the fiendishly clever ways you can 
organize things in Illustrator. Explore ’em all in Chapter 13.)
You can select onscreen items with the Selection tool in two ways:
 
✓ Click the object that you want to select. The object and any other 
object that’s grouped with it are selected.
 
✓ Click and drag with the Selection tool. As you do, a dotted rectangle — a 
marquee — appears. Anything inside or touching the marquee is selected, 
enabling you to select more than one object or group at a time, as shown 
in Figure 6-2. You’ll notice that a lot of blue points are highlighted that 
were originally outside the marquee that was drawn; that’s because at 
least a tiny bit of the objects with those highlighted points were touched 
by the edge of the marquee, and therefore the entire object was selected.
 
 
Figure 6-2: The Selection tool selects objects that are within 
 
(or touched by) the marquee.
 
If you click another path when one path is already selected, the path that 
you click is selected, and the previously selected path is deselected. If 
you click an empty area, everything is deselected. If you press the Shift key 
when you click another path when one path is already selected, the new 

122
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
path is selected while the original one is still selected. In this way, the Shift 
key allows you to add to a selection (and if you Shift-click on a path that is 
already selected, you’ll deselect just that path, letting you subtract from a 
selection as well). More details on adding and subtracting to selections below 
in the section “Selecting more or less of what you have.”
Also, if you click inside a path that’s filled with None, you can’t select that 
path. To select a path that has no fill, click the path itself. Similarly, when 
you’re in Outline view mode (a way of looking at your paths with all fill and 
stroke colors hidden, accessed by choosing View➪Outline), you click your 
paths to select them. (See Chapter 5 for more info on fills and strokes.)
Direct Selection tool
 
 The Selection tool selects entire paths or groups, while the Direct Selection 
tool selects exactly what you click on. Use the Direct Selection tool to select 
individual points, path segments, type objects, and placed images by clicking 
them one at a time. If you drag a marquee with the Direct Selection tool, 
everything that the marquee encloses gets selected — all placed images, type 
objects, and portions of paths. Figure 6-3 shows what’s selected when you 
drag the Direct Selection marquee around several objects. (Note especially 
the star in the very center of the selected objects at the right of the figure: 
Some of its points are included in the selection; others aren’t.) Since the 
Direct Selection tool allows points within objects to be selected, some points 
on some of the stars are selected (solid squares) while some are unselected, 
but visible (hollow squares).
 
 
Figure 6-3: A selection in progress with the Direct Selection tool.
 
With the Direct Selection tool, if you select the interior of a path (if it’s filled) 
rather than the edge or actual line of the path, you select the entire path 
rather than just the individual anchor point and path segments.

123
 Chapter 6: Selecting and Editing Paths
Group Selection tool
 
 Illustrator provides a special tool for selecting groups — Group Selection. 
(Go figure.) However, this tool selects groups a little differently. Whereas the 
plain ol’ Selection tool selects everything that’s grouped to the object that 
you select, the Group Selection tool selects only one subgroup at a time.
A subgroup is a group within a group. Remember Statistics 101? (Don’t make 
that face. What if it froze like that?) Suppose you want to create a graphic of 
a pencil. You start with the easy part — the lead. Then you go on to create 
something harder: that conical bit of wood that flares out around the lead 
and eventually becomes the rest of the pencil. After you get those two pieces 
positioned together the way you like, you want to keep them that way — so 
you group them together. (That way, you have to click only one of them with 
the Selection tool, and they move together.) Next, you create the rest of the 
pencil separately. After you bring all the pieces together, you want to keep 
them that way — so you group the lead and the cone with the rest of the 
pencil. All three objects are now a group, and the lead and the cone are a 
subgroup of that group.
You can continue grouping things, having as many subgroups as you want. 
Illustrator remembers the order in which you group things from the first 
subgroup to the last big group. When you click multiple times with the Group 
Selection tool, the first click selects the pencil lead, the second selects both 
the lead and the wood, and the third click selects the lead, the wood, and the 
rest of the pencil.
The Group Selection tool selects only one subgroup at a time, such as an 
object within a group, a single group within multiple groups, or a set of 
groups within the artwork. To find out how the Group Selection tool works, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Group Selection tool from the Toolbox.
 
2. Click a path that’s part of a group.
 
 The path is selected entirely (all the points are solid; none are hollow), 
but the other objects in the group are not selected. (This result is an 
oddity of the tool. It first selects a single object, even though an object 
isn’t really a group.)
 
3. Click the same path again.
 
 The next higher level of grouped objects is selected, as well as anything 
that’s already been selected. Each time you click, you select the next 
higher level of grouping, until finally the all-encompassing group-of-all-
groups is selected.

124
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
If you continue this crazed clicking, you wind up with groups of groups. For 
example, if you make several on-screen drawings of pencils, you can group 
them so that you can move them all at once, draw a pencil box, and then 
group the pencils with the box. The Group Selection tool lets you select “up” 
from a single object to the group that the object belongs to, and so on. Figure 
6-4 applies this principle to the objects that form a pencil when grouped 
together.
 
 
 Figure 6-4: The Group Selection tool selects first the path, then the group 
that the path is in, and then the group that the first group is in.
Selecting more or less of what you have
Suppose you want to select a path on the left side of your document, and you 
also want to select a placed image on the right side of your document, but 
lots of paths are in between. You can’t drag a marquee because you get all 
those unwanted paths in the middle. So you select the path on the left and 
then click the object on the right — and the path on the left becomes dese-
lected. Drat!
Use the Shift key to select more than one item at a time. If you hold down the 
Shift key and click a path with the Selection tool, you add that path to what-
ever is selected. If two paths are selected, pressing the Shift key and click-
ing another path results in all three paths being selected. You can also use 
the Shift key in conjunction with a selection marquee. The process is Shift-
clicking, and you can also use it to select fewer paths. For example, if you 
Shift-click one of the three selected paths shown in Figure 6-5, you deselect 
that path, leaving only two selected paths.
 
Shift-clicking also works with the Direct Selection tool except that this action 
adds or subtracts single points instead of complete paths — unless you 
click the interior of a filled path, in which case you add or subtract complete 
paths.

125
 Chapter 6: Selecting and Editing Paths
 
 
Figure 6-5: (Left) Three selected paths. (Right) Shift-clicking the middle 
 
path leaves only two paths selected.
Freeform selections: Lasso tool
 
 The Lasso tool acts similarly to dragging a selection marquee except that this 
type of marquee can be any shape (not just rectangular). To use the tool, 
click and drag around the area that you want to select. When you release the 
mouse button, all points in that area are selected.
 
Pressing the Shift key with the Lasso tool allows you to add selections to 
anything that’s already selected . . . but you probably guessed that already. 
What you haven’t guessed (unless you’re a bona fide psychic) is that you use 
Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) to subtract from a selection. If you accidentally 
select something, you don’t need to reselect. Just press Option (Mac)/Alt 
(Windows) and drag around the points you don’t want selected.
Magic Wand tool
 
 Use the Magic Wand tool to make selections based on similarities in various 
object attributes — exactly the same or based on a range of settings.
To use the tool, click the object, which can be either an open or a closed 
path (for example, a square or a line). Illustrator then goes out and selects all 
objects similar to the object you clicked. How similar do the objects have to 
be? Excellent question! Read on to get the scoop.
Choose Window➪Magic Wand or simply double-click the Magic Wand tool to 
bring up the Magic Wand panel, as shown in Figure 6-6. Here you find settings 
for Fill Color, Stroke Color, Stroke Weight, Opacity, and Blending Mode attri-
butes. Checking one or more of these attributes selects objects based on that 
particular attribute or attributes. The Tolerance setting establishes the range 
within which the attribute must fall to be selected.

126
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
For example, if you select a stroke weight with a Tolerance setting of 2 points 
(pt) and click an object with a stroke weight of 5 pt, all objects with a stroke 
weight between 3 and 7 pt will be selected (5 pt – 2pt, and 5pt + 2 pt). Similarly, 
if you select the Opacity option and set the Tolerance setting to 10 percent, all 
objects with an opacity between 40 percent and 60 percent are selected when 
you click an object with an opacity of 50 percent.
The Tolerance settings for Fill Color and Stroke 
Color range from 0–255, which equates to the 
number of brightness levels. Rather than go into 
the techno-geek definition of brightness levels, a 
lower Tolerance setting selects only colors that 
are very similar to the object you click, whereas 
a higher Tolerance setting selects a wider range 
of colors. The only attribute that must be exactly 
the same is Blending Mode. (For more on blend-
ing modes, see Chapter 10.)
Selecting without Tools: 
The Select Menu
Sometimes selecting objects in Illustrator without using tools is easier or 
more convenient than selecting with tools. Because selecting is so important, 
Illustrator provides a menu entirely devoted to selection commands.
Select menu options
Here are the options you can find 
on the Select menu, as shown in 
Figure 6-7:
 
✓ All: By far, the most common 
selection method in Illustrator 
is the keyboard command Ô+A 
(Mac)/Ctrl+A (Windows), which 
is the stalwart command for 
Select All. You can also choose 
Select➪All, but the keyboard 
command is so useful that you’ll 
probably memorize it in no time 
at all.
Figure 6-6: The Magic Wand 
panel offers Tolerance settings 
for object attributes.
Figure 6-7: The Select menu.

127
 Chapter 6: Selecting and Editing Paths
 
✓ All in Active Artboard: This command selects all the objects within 
whichever artboard is currently active. Objects that straddle multiple 
artboards will also be selected if a portion of that object is within the 
active artboard.
 
✓ Deselect: The opposite of All is the Deselect command, which deselects 
anything selected in the document (but you knew that). You don’t have 
to select everything to use the command. If you have just one thing 
selected from 100 objects, Deselect deselects it. The keyboard command 
is easy to remember: Ô+Shift+A (Mac)/Ctrl+Shift+A (Windows).
 
✓ Reselect: Using the Reselect command reselects whatever was last 
selected via the Selection menu. The keyboard command is Ô+6 (Mac)/
Crtl+6 (Windows).
 
✓ Inverse: Using the Inverse command selects the opposite of what’s 
selected. In other words, everything that’s selected becomes unselected, 
and everything else becomes selected. For example, if you select one of 
four squares, using the Inverse command selects the remaining three 
squares and deselects the original square. Hint: Inverse works only with 
entire paths. (The same goes for Reselect.) Using the same example, if 
you have only a single anchor point selected on the first square, using 
the Inverse command still selects the other three squares and ignores 
the unselected three anchor points on the first square.
 
✓ Next Object Above and Next Object Below: Using these commands 
selects objects based on their stacking order— how objects are 
placed  in front of other objects. For example, say you draw a square, 
a circle, and then a polygon. If you then select the square and choose 
Select➪Next Object Below, Illustrator selects the circle. If you choose 
the command again, Illustrator selects the polygon, and so forth.
 
 Same and Object: Using the Select➪Object➪Same commands selects 
everything that is the same as the currently selected object. Using the 
Select➪Object➪All on Same Layers command selects everything that 
resides on the active layer (the one that’s highlighted in the Layers 
panel).
 
 The Same and Object commands are described in more detail below. 
 
✓ Save Selection: Using the Save Selection command allows you to save 
selections. Select an object (or objects) and then choose Select➪Save 
Selection. In the Save Selection dialog box, name the selection and then 
click OK. The saved selection now appears at the bottom of the Select 
menu, just begging to be chosen. You can delete the saved selection 
or modify its name by choosing Select➪Edit Selection and making the 
necessary changes in the Edit Selection dialog box.

128
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Specialized selection functions 
for important occasions
The Select menu contains a lot of 
other selection functions besides 
those mentioned in the preceding 
section. Located under the Same 
and Object submenus, these func-
tions are designed to select objects 
that are similar in some way (such 
as style or fill color) to the object(s) 
already selected. Figure 6-8 shows 
what would happen if you went for 
the Same submenu.
These commands can be vastly help-
ful in streamlining the editing pro-
cess. For instance, if your client loves everything about the image except for 
that certain shade of blue, you can select one object that has that blue color 
in it, and then choose Select➪Same➪Stroke Color or Fill Color. With every-
thing in that color selected, you can edit them all at once! If you’re having 
trouble printing lines of a certain stroke weight, choose Select➪Same➪Stroke 
Weight and increase the stroke weight of all the lines. (See Chapter 5 for 
more information on fills and strokes.) Other commands select items that 
have a history of problems printing on certain printers, such as stray points, 
brushstrokes, and masks. Selecting such items lets you modify them before 
printing. (See Chapter 15 for more about printing.)
The four options that fall under the Object submenu are a bit less obvious:
 
✓ Brush Strokes: Selects all paths in the document that have brush 
strokes assigned to them.
 
✓ Clipping Masks: Selects paths used as masks in the document.
 
✓ Direction Handles: Selects the direction handles of the Bézier curves of 
selected objects. (For more on direction handles, see the next section on 
editing and adjusting points.)
 
✓ Stray Points: Selects paths in your document that contain only a single 
point.
Editing and Adjusting Points
After you go through the trouble of selecting specific points, what do you do 
with them? Well, you can move them and change the kinds of points they are. 
You can also adjust their handles to change the shape of a curve.
Figure 6-8: The Same sub-menu provides a 
whole slew of selection goodies.

 Chapter 6: Selecting and Editing Paths
A relocation bonus for points
You can move any selected point to 
any location. Because points (and 
not entire paths) are what you’re 
moving, use the Direct Selection 
tool. Click any point with the Direct 
Selection tool and then drag the 
point to move it. You can do this in 
one step (click and drag at once) 
or in two separate steps (click and 
release and then drag the point). 
Figure 6-9 shows a path with a point 
in its original location after it was 
moved with the Direct Selection tool.
 
To move points just a tiny little bit at 
a time — yet with precision — use the arrow keys to nudge selected points 
in the direction of the arrow. One keystroke moves the point by an exact, 
smidgen-sized unit of measurement (1/72 of an inch, or .3528 millimeters) — a 
unit of measure known in the design and publishing trades as a point.
Fine-tuning curves with direction points
If a point has direction points (those little gearshift-like line segments) sticking 
out of it, you can use the Direct Selection tool to adjust the direction points, 
which adjusts the curves that shoot out from the points where the direction 
points connect to the curves.
 
Incidentally, the line that joins the direction point to the curve is called the 
direction line. Don’t worry: Only you can see the direction lines. They don’t 
print or show up in the graphic when it’s on the Web. Their only purpose is 
to show which anchor point is currently under the control of the direction 
point. The combination of the direction line and direction point is also com-
monly referred to as direction handles or just plain handles.
You probably noticed already that 
sometimes you see those gearshift-
like direction lines and direction 
points sticking out of points and 
sometimes you don’t. When you click 
a point or a segment with the Direct 
Selection tool, you see the handles 
associated with that point or seg-
ment. However, if you Shift+click 
additional points, you lose those 
handles. Figure 6-10 shows what 
Figure 6-9: (Left) Original path. (Right) Path 
after you move the selected point with Direct 
Selection.
Figure 6-10: A selected curve reveals its 
direction points and direction lines.

130
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
happens when you use the Direct Selection tool to click (or enclose in a mar-
quee) a variety of different areas.
When you can see the handles that you want to move, click and drag them. 
Note that missing a handle is very easy if you aren’t really careful. (And 
making crude remarks when you do miss them is still considered bad form, 
even if no one else is around.) Figure 6-11 shows the path from Figure 6-10 
with the direction points moved to different positions.
 
You can change the size of 
those handles by choosing 
Edit➪Preferences➪Selection 
& Anchor Display. Just click on 
the appropriate picture showing 
the different handle and anchor 
point sizes, click OK, and you’ll 
have an easier (or harder if that’s 
your thing) time of clicking those 
anchor points.
Converting anchor points
Illustrator has four types of anchor points: corner points; smooth points; and 
two types of direction-changing points. Every path has at least one of these 
types, and in many situations, you’ll find that you need to change one type of 
anchor point into another, instead of going through the trouble of redrawing 
a path.
 
✓ Straight-corner anchor points are in the corners of squares or triangles. 
Two path segments join in a corner point when neither of the connect-
ing ends has a direction point associated with it.
 
✓ Smooth anchor points are used when two path segments continue 
smoothly, as in a circle or in a curving path. Both path segments have 
direction points linked so that when you move one point, the other point 
moves in an equal and opposite direction, preserving the smooth curve.
 
✓ A curved-corner anchor point has two direction points that move in differ-
ent directions, enabling you to impose abrupt changes in direction.
 
✓ A combination-corner anchor point has one direction point, allowing 
a straight line to join a curved line at an abrupt angle. (For more on 
anchor point types, see Chapter 7.)

the direction points are moved.

 Chapter 6: Selecting and Editing Paths
Use the Illustrator Convert Anchor Point tool (which looks like an acute 
angle, and is located in the same slot as the Pen tool) to change a point from 
one type into another. (For more about the types of anchor points and their 
usual behaviors, see Chapters 2 and 7.) To use the Convert Anchor Point 
tool, put it on a point and click. What you do next determines the resulting 
point type:
 
✓ To get a straight-corner anchor point: Click an anchor point and release 
to change it into a straight corner point with no direction points.
 
 This is a quick-retract method of point conversion.
 
✓ To get a smooth anchor point: Click an anchor point and drag it to 
change it into a smooth point with two linked direction points.
 
✓ To get a curved-corner anchor point: Click a direction point and drag. It 
moves independently of the opposite direction point.
 
✓ To create a combination-corner anchor point from a smooth point or a 
curved-corner anchor point: Click one of the direction points and drag 
it into the anchor point (leaving one direction point for the curved side 
of the point).
 
You can also quickly toggle back and forth between corner and smooth 
points by clicking the appropriate button in the upper left of the Control 
panel docked at the top of the work area. Click the corner-looking one to 
change the selected point(s) to a corner point, and click the curved-looking 
one to change the selected points(s) to a smooth point.
Adding and subtracting points (path math)
Illustrator has two tools that are used specifically for adding points to a path 
or for removing them. The Add Anchor Point tool adds points, and the Delete 
Anchor Point tool removes points. Both tools are located in the same slot as 
the Pen tool.
When you add an anchor point (or even several anchor points) with the Add 
Anchor Point tool, the path doesn’t change shape (as shown in Figure 6-12), 
but you can then move the point or points with the Direct Selection tool or 
convert them to other types of points by using the Convert Anchor Point 
tool.
When you remove a point with the Delete Anchor Point tool, the path can 
change shape — slightly or dramatically, depending on the shape. Figure 6-13 
shows what happens in two different circumstances.

Okay, have a squint at Figure 6-13 for a moment. (Ow, that’s gotta hurt. Not 
that hard.) You can probably tell immediately which anchor points were 
zapped with the Delete Anchor Point tool to change the image on the left into 
the upper- and lower-right images. In each case, only one point was removed. 
Powerful creatures, those anchor points.

ack in medieval times (circa 1982), straight and smooth-curved lines 
were drawn with elegant handheld implements, such as a Rapidograph 
pen (an unwieldy, blotch-making tool), a ruler, and a French Curve. If you 
never had to use these torturous instruments, consider yourself lucky. With a 
Rapidograph pen, you got bumpy globs of ink and huge splotches that goosh 
onto the page each time you paused or changed direction.
 
 Today, if you need a straight line or a curved one — or even if 
you want the appearance of bumpy globs of ink — use the 
Illustrator Pen tool. This tool is a bit intimidating at first, 
but after you grasp a few concepts, you’ll be drawing 
floor plans, customizing logos, and feeling really sorry 
for people who don’t have Illustrator.
Unlike its handheld, inky counterpart, the Pen tool 
is not intuitive. You can’t just pick it up and doodle; 
its functionality is far from obvious. This tool is 
unlike any drawing instrument in the world. But 
locked within the Pen tool are secrets and powers 
beyond those of mere physical ink. The Pen tool is 
a metaphysical doorway to the heavens of artistic 
exaltation; after you master the path of the Pen tool, all 
the riches of Illustrator can be yours. (You might even be 
unfazed by such hokey metaphors.)

Performing with the Pen, the Path, 
and the Anchor Points
No, this section isn’t a retro look at obscure rock bands; it’s about telling 
Illustrator where to go — that is, by creating the paths Illustrator relies on to 
create shapes and objects. Paths are instructions that tell your computer how 
to arrange straight- and curved-line segments onscreen. Each path is made 
up of anchor points (dots that appear on-screen). Between every two anchor 
points is the portion of the path called a line segment.
The Pen tool is probably as close as you ever get to calling up paths with 
the PostScript language — unless you’re an Adobe programming geek (in 
which case, the thought that you might need this book is frightening). For 
sanity’s sake, I assume otherwise and get right to the point. Make that points. 
Understanding the anchor points that make up paths is critical to using the 
Pen tool. Anchor points have the following traits:
 
✓ At least two anchor points are required for every path. “One point 
maketh not a path,” saith the sage.
 
✓ Any number of anchor points can appear on a path. You can have 
dozens, even hundreds, as long as that number is not one or zero. “Zero 
points make not a path, either, O wiseacre,” grouseth the sage.
 
✓ If an anchor point has a direction point (a blue box you can grab and move 
with the mouse), the line segment extending from the anchor point is 
curved.
 
✓ If an anchor point has no direction point, the line segment extending 
from the anchor point is straight. 
 
✓ You can use the Pen tool to create four types of anchor points 
(smooth, straight-corner, curved-corner, and combination-corner) to tell 
the computer how to get from one line segment to another. Care for a 
closer look? Coming right up.
Smooth anchor points
Smooth anchor points create a 
smoothly curved transition from 
one line segment to another. When 
you want a line that reminds you of 
the letter S (or some S-words, such 
as sinuous and snaky), use smooth 
anchor points. Figure 7-1 shows two 
direction points creating a smooth 
anchor point on a path. The curve 
bends to follow the two direction 
points.

 Chapter 7: Wielding the Mighty Pen Tool
If you want to create circles or free-form shapes — such as puddles, or 
shapes like those nonslip flower stickers for your bathtub — smooth anchor 
points are the way to go. To create a smooth anchor point, click and drag 
with the mouse while using the Pen tool. While you drag, direction points 
(connected to the anchor point by direction lines) appear on either side of 
the anchor point (one at the tip of the Pen, and the other on the opposite 
side of the anchor point). Think of those wacky direction points as magnets 
pulling the line segment toward them. The line segment bends to follow the 
direction point — just that easy, just that simple. (So far.)
Straight-corner anchor points
Straight-corner anchor points function as their name suggests and have both 
the following characteristics:
 
✓ One or two straight lines sticking out of them: In Figure 7-2, for exam-
ple, all the anchor points are Straight-corner anchor points.
 
✓ No direction points sticking out of them. (Remember, direction points 
make curves.)
Think of this type of anchor point as 
the corner of an angle that you draw 
with a pencil and a protractor. To 
create straight-corner anchor points 
with the Pen tool, click and release; 
do not drag. Promptly release the 
mouse button the second you hear 
it click.
Use straight-corner anchor points to 
draw objects with hard angles — think rectangles and triangles (note the 
whole “angle” theme here) — anything that consists entirely of straight lines 
and no curves. Snakes, clouds, and country roads are entirely out of the 
question.
Curved-corner anchor points
Think of the curved-corner anchor point (also referred to as a cusp point) 
as the m-curve anchor point, or the point where the two bumps on a lower-
case m are joined. If you look at this nice lowercase m through a magnifying 
glass, you can see a corner, between the two bumps, with curves coming out 
from it. The curved-corner anchor point might also remind you of a double 
fishhook turned upside down. You need these points to create not just lower-
case m’s, but also hearts (the Valentine variety, as shown in Figure 7-3).
Figure 7-2: Use straight-corner anchor points 
when you need straight paths.

136
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Consider the possibilities — clovers, 
moons (old-fashioned crescents-
with-little-noses), and other shapes 
you might see in a cereal bowl. 
(Okay, not the blue diamonds — 
those you draw with straight-corner 
anchor points.) Beware, though, that 
curved-corner anchor points are a 
little weird. To create one, you have 
to modify an existing anchor point 
by following these steps:
 
1. Create a smooth anchor point 
while you’re creating a path.
 
 This works best after you draw 
at least one line segment.
 
2. Press Option (Mac)/ Alt 
(Windows) and then click and 
drag the smooth anchor point.
 
 A direction point appears — 
totally independent of the 
anchor point — on the oppo-
site side of the point. This new 
handle controls where the double-fishhook corner goes. You can drag 
the new handle nearer to the first direction point (the one for the origi-
nal smooth anchor point) — or anywhere else — without affecting that 
first direction point.
Combination-corner anchor points
If you want to use the Pen tool to draw rounded-corner rectangles — such as 
what you see on classic TV screens, archways, cylinders, and your friendly 
neighborhood iPhone screen — you need combination-corner anchor points. 
The combination blends smooth and straight-corner anchor points. You can 
identify a combination-corner anchor point by what you find sticking out of 
it: two line segments but only one direction point. This handle curves one 
of the line segments while leaving the other segment straight. If you keep in 
mind that the handle is controlling the curved segment, not the straight seg-
ment, you’ll have less trouble getting these points to work for you.
Like with curved-corner anchor points (mutant versions of their straight-
corner cousins), you can’t just say, “I want one of those” and poof! have one 
appear on-screen. To create the exotic combination-corner anchor point, 
Figure 7-3: This heart shows two curved-
corner anchor points.

137
 Chapter 7: Wielding the Mighty Pen Tool
modify an existing smooth or straight-corner anchor point. Which type you 
modify depends on where you want the curve to go:
 
✓ If you want the curve before the anchor point (the existing line seg-
ment is curved), you modify a smooth anchor point.
 
✓ If you want the curve after the 
anchor point (the existing line 
segment is straight), you modify 
a straight-corner anchor point.
Figure 7-4 shows a combination-
corner anchor point in the middle 
of a path.
Starting with a smooth path
To create a combination-corner anchor point from a smooth one (so that the 
curve precedes the anchor point), follow these steps, shown in Figure 7-5:
 
1. Click and drag the Pen tool.
 
 Start in the upper-left quarter 
of a blank Illustrator document. 
When you’re there, click and 
drag up and to the right for your 
first drag.
 
2. Click and drag the Pen tool at 
another location to create a 
curved line.
 
 Start your second drag at a 
place roughly parallel to your 
original starting point and about 
an inch to the right, dragging 
down and to the right.
 
 To see what you’re doing, you have to draw at least one line segment 
before you change the anchor point. That’s the rule!
 
 When you complete Step 2, the most recent line segment ends in a 
smooth anchor point.
 
3. Click (don’t drag!) the smooth anchor point that appeared after you 
clicked and dragged in Step 2.
 
 The direction point (handle) that extended out from the anchor point 
disappears.

in Figure 7-4 when starting with a smooth path.

138
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
4. Move the mouse pointer to a place about an inch to the right of the 
most recent anchor point and click.
 
 A straight path segment (straight because it’s free from the influence of 
the direction point) appears. After you click, the two direction points 
(handles) disappear from the curved line that you drew in Step 2. The 
anchor point from which you drew your new straight segment is a com-
bination-corner anchor point.
Starting with a straight path
To create a combination-corner anchor point from a straight-corner anchor 
point (so the curve comes after the anchor point), follow these steps, as 
shown in Figure 7-6:
 
1. Using the Pen tool, click once 
and (without dragging) click 
again in a nearby location in 
the document.
 
 To get a path that resembles 
the straight path on the right 
side of Figure 7-4, start in the 
upper-right quarter of a blank 
Illustrator document, and click 
once.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer to the 
left and click (again without 
dragging).
 
 A straight path segment appears. You need this line segment so that 
you can see the difference in the path as you change the straight-corner 
anchor point to a combination-corner anchor point.
 
3. Click the straight-corner anchor point you just created; hold down the 
mouse button and drag.
 
 To get an image that resembles the one in Figure 7-4, drag up and 
slightly to the left.
 
 A new, single direction point (handle) extends from the anchor point.
 
4. Click in another location and drag away from the anchor point.
 
 Click a spot to the left of the previous anchor point, and then drag down 
and slightly to the left.
 
 A curved path segment appears. The anchor point between the straight 
and curved line segments is now a combination-corner anchor point.
4) Click and drag down and to the left

Creating Straight Lines with the Pen Tool
Using logic as valid as any followed by Holmes and Watson (not to mention 
Spock), you can deduce that you use straight-corner anchor points to draw 
straight lines with the Pen tool. Elementary. . . .
Harrumph. Elementary or not, you should jolly well see this marvel in action. 
To draw a triangle with the Pen tool using straight-corner anchor points (see 
Figure 7-7), just follow these steps:
 
1. With the Pen tool, click (do 
not drag) in the Document 
window.
 
 An anchor point appears after 
you release the mouse button. 
(Cute, isn’t it? But lonely; it 
needs friends.)
 
2. Click (don’t drag) somewhere 
below and a little to the right 
of the first anchor point.
 
 After you release the mouse 
button, a line appears between 
the first and second anchor 
points. They’re joined, open, 
and ready to rock. You created a fine-looking path.
 
3. Click (don’t drag!) somewhere a bit to the left of the second anchor 
point.
 
 A stunning-looking angle appears. Maybe it’s a skateboard ramp. Maybe 
it’s a less-than sign flopped over, worn out from all those equations.
 
4. Put your cursor on the first anchor point and click that puppy.
 
 You created a triangle! Congratulations! Euclid would be proud.
Well, okay, you’ve heard this tune before, but once more with feeling: Do 
not drag if you want straight lines. If you drag, you’re going to get curves. In 
fact, not dragging to get straight lines is probably harder than dragging to 
get curves. (If you want to take a break and go drag something, be my guest; 
you’ve earned it.)
 
You can create right angles and 45° angles with the Pen tool by holding down 
the Shift key when you click each point with the Pen tool. If you’re close to 
45° away from the last click, you’ll get a 45° angle. If you’re closer to 90° from 
the last click, you’ll get a 90° angle.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Open and Closed Paths
Paths in Illustrator are open or closed — one or the other, with nothing in 
between. Open and closed paths differ in the following ways:
 
✓ Open: An open path has endpoints. It starts in one place and ends in 
another place — clearly a line segment, and not a polygon.
 
✓ Closed: A closed path has no starting point and no endpoint. Like that 
psychotic bunny in the battery commercial, it just keeps going and going 
in the same place — clearly the boundary of a solid shape. (Think of 
complete circles, Möbius strips, and so forth.)
 
Creating artwork with the Pen tool is much easier if you set your fill color 
to None, regardless of the final color you’re going to fill your artwork with. 
(To set the fill color to None, click the Fill square in either the Tools panel 
or the Color panel and then click the box with a red slash in it.) When you 
use the Pen tool with a fill color selected, Illustrator treats every line you 
make as though it were a completed object by drawing a temporary, invisible 
line straight from the first anchor point in the path to the last anchor point, 
and then fills the enclosed area with the selected fill color. This is confusing 
at best because it hides parts of the path that you are creating and creates 
an object that appears to change shape completely with every click of the 
mouse. To avoid this mess, set your fill color to None while you create your 
path and change the fill color when the path is complete.
Creating Super-Precise Curves with the Pen Tool
The Illustrator Pen tool is a model of precision and accuracy. With it, you can 
draw virtually anything (or draw anything virtually). That is, of course, after 
you master drawing curves.
The Pen isn’t designed to be maddening (as far as I know), but using it to 
draw successful curves does seem to require a psychological breakthrough. 
Illustrator users who struggle to figure out the Pen tool by themselves, with-
out the handy guide you hold in your hands, might slog through months (or 
even years) of frustration before the breakthrough occurs. They happen 
upon shapes and curves that work for them — and then they finally “get it.”
Therefore, I vow to spare you the pain of all that trial and error. The following 
sections begin this noble quest, in which you find the knight. . . .
Taming the draggin’
(Sorry about the bad pun.) Where do you want your curve to go? Just drag in 
that direction. I know, I know, I told you not to drag. But in that situation, you 

141
 Chapter 7: Wielding the Mighty Pen Tool
were making straight lines. What’s even less helpful, dragging is perhaps the 
most anti-intuitive action imaginable for creating curves. Regardless, I charge 
into the fray.
If you click and drag with the intent to create a curve, you get what looks 
like a straight line, as shown in Figure 7-8. (Weird, isn’t it?) Oddly enough, 
the “line” you get is twice as long as the distance you drag, extending in 
two directions from the spot where you initially click. After you release the 
mouse button, this “line” is still a straight line and still no curve in sight.
At this stage, what do you suppose 
is the most natural thing in the world 
to do? Sure — it’s to drag in another 
direction (typically at a 90° angle) 
from where you last released the 
mouse. And what are the most natu-
ral results? An ugly, curvy bump; 
a new “straight” line extending in 
both directions from the second 
anchor point; and a sudden yearning 
to direct a few choice expletives at 
Illustrator.
The problem is the second anchor 
point. Instead of clicking and dragging at a spot near where you first released 
the mouse button (a big no-no), you always click and drag (you don’t have to 
drag, but I get to that later) away from where you released the mouse button 
which will get you a nice smooth curve like the one shown in Figure 7-9. You 
understood correctly — away. Weird, isn’t it?
 
 
Figure 7-9: A nice smooth flowing curve, generated by the Pen tool.
To create a lovely, flowing curve for your own purposes, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click and drag with the Pen tool.
 
 A line extends from the anchor point where you clicked. That’s okay; it’s 
supposed to happen that way.
Figure 7-8: When creating a curve, drag out 
a straight line; the arrow shows the direction 
of the drag.

142
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 The line you see is actually a set of two direction points (connected to 
the curve by direction lines), cleverly disguised as lines with little control-
handle boxes at each end. Whether you call them direction points or 
control handles, lines, or boxes, they don’t print out. They’re just tools 
for controlling the direction of the line segment that you’re drawing.
 
2. Without clicking, place your cursor away from both the anchor point 
and the direction points. Then click and drag in the direction oppo-
site the direction you dragged to create the first anchor point.
 
 At this stage, the best approach is to place that second click perpendicu-
lar to the direction lines. Note that as you drag, you can actually see the 
curve between the two anchor points take shape and change. If you drag 
the same distance that you dragged for the first anchor point, you create 
an even-looking curve.
 
3. Finally, place your cursor away from the second point, still moving 
away from the first anchor point, and click and drag back in the same 
direction you dragged for the first anchor point.
 
 After you release the mouse button, you see an S shape (or a backward 
S, depending on which way you first dragged). Rejoice! If you don’t see 
the S or reverse-S shape, breathe deeply, count to 10, and try again, 
exercising superhuman patience and care. Think Clark Kent.
 
Remember that whole song and dance about pressing the Shift key so that 
new anchor points appear angled at 45° relative to the last anchor point? 
Well, you can also use the Shift key to constrain the angle of control-handle 
lines to 45°, if you prefer. This action lets you make much more accurate 
curves than by drawing freestyle. Just don’t press and hold the Shift key until 
after you begin dragging with the Pen tool. If you press the Shift key before 
you drag — and release the key while you’re dragging — you get the 45° 
anchor point. If you continue to hold down the Shift key, you get the whole 
shebang: 45° control-handle lines as well as the anchor point.
Following the one-third rule
The optimal distance to drag a direction point from an anchor point is about 
one-third the distance you expect that line segment to be. So, for instance, if 
you plan to draw a curve that’s about three inches long, drag the direction 
point out about one inch from the anchor point.
The one-third rule is perfect for creating the most natural, organic-looking 
curves possible. Breaking the rule can have the following dismal results:
 
✓ If you drag too little, you get curves that are too shallow around the 
middle of the line segment and too sharp at the anchor points.
 
✓ If you drag too much, you get curves that are quite sharp (like Dead 
Man’s Curve) around the middle of the line segment and too straight 
around the anchor points (like that curve on the right in Figure 7-10).

143
 Chapter 7: Wielding the Mighty Pen Tool
Fortunately, on the left, Figure 7-10 shows a “perfect” curve created with the 
proper use of direction point lines set to one-third the length of the path. 
Because you can use the Direct Selection tool (the hollow arrow) to adjust 
the position of the direction points after they’re drawn, try to follow the one-
third rule whenever possible. Doing so might keep you out of trouble (and 
your vocabulary fit for sensitive listeners).
 
 
 Figure 7-10: (Left) Anchor points with direction point lines one-third the 
distance along the path. (Right) Dragging too much.
Following rules for the other two-thirds
The one-third rule is the most important rule when you’re using the Pen tool 
to draw curves. Of course, you still have to deal with the other two-thirds of 
the line segment; that’s where a few humble rules can serve you well. Even if 
you don’t plan to follow them right away — because you’re still at that awk-
ward, rebellious age — you at least want to be familiar with these rules:
 
✓ Drag in the direction of the path. Dragging back toward the line seg-
ment you just drew results in hard-to-control curves and awkward-
appearing line segments between the previous anchor point and the 
anchor point you’re working with. If you need to go back toward the line 
segment, place an anchor point closer to the previous anchor point you 
created. Figure 7-11 shows what happens to a path when you drag the 
wrong way . . . back towards the last point.
 
 
 Figure 7-11: The 2nd point (on the right) was created by dragging to the 
left, resulting in this odd path.

144
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Focus on the upcoming segment as well as the current one. You might 
notice that the line segment between the prior anchor point and the cur-
rent anchor point can distract you because it changes while you drag. 
If you concentrate only on this line segment, the direction point you’re 
dragging out for the next line segment probably won’t be the right length 
or angle. You must master the past, present, and future when you use 
the Pen tool. (Aside from that, it isn’t hard at all.)
 
✓ Don’t overcompensate for a misdrawn curve. If you mess up on that 
last outgoing direction point, don’t try to “fix” the line segment with the 
anchor point you’re currently dragging. Instead, focus on the next seg-
ment; try to ignore the goof-up for now. You can always use the Direct 
Selection tool to fix the poor thing after you finish the path. Chapter 6 
has the lowdown on how you can adjust your path after you draw it.
 
✓ Use different lengths for each direction point, as necessary. This rule 
is the exception to the previous two rules. (You knew there had to be an 
exception.) If you click and drag and get a segment just right — only to real-
ize that the next segment requires a longer or shorter control-handle line 
but the same angle — release the mouse button when the segment is just right.
 
 Then click the same anchor point again and drag in the same direction 
as you previously dragged. Note that as you change the angle of the 
direction point on the “other” side (where the previous segment is), 
you aren’t changing the length of that direction point line. And you can 
match the angle pretty easily because you can see both “before” and 
“after” versions of the previous line segment.
 
✓ Place anchor points at curve transitions. A curve transition is a place 
where the curve changes. Maybe it changes direction (going from clock-
wise to counterclockwise or vice versa). Maybe the curve gets smaller 
or larger. Figure 7-12 shows a nice curvy path with anchor points placed 
properly at the transitions.
 
 
 Figure 7-12: This path has points placed at the “correct” locations for the best possible curve.

145
 Chapter 7: Wielding the Mighty Pen Tool
 
✓ Be environmentally conscious in your anchor point usage. Don’t place 
anchor points where they’re not needed. This rule goes for all types of 
anchor points. The fewer you have makes editing sections of the path 
easier (keeping in mind the previous rule, of course). Fewer anchor 
points also allow for quicker and trouble-free printing.
 
Holding down the Ô key (Ctrl for Windows) changes the selected tool into 
whatever selection tool you used last. This is very handy when you’re draw-
ing with the Pen tool because it enables you to move points while keeping the 
Pen tool selected. Click the Direct Selection tool before you choose the Pen 
tool. If you click, start to drag, and then realize that you clicked in a spot that 
just isn’t going to work, just press Ô/Ctrl. This temporarily changes the Pen 
tool into the Direct Selection tool. Move your anchor point to a new location. 
Release Ô/Ctrl, and your anchor point moves to the new location, just like 
that, and your cursor changes back to the Pen tool automatically!
Drawing the tricky anchor points with the Pen tool
A bit of practice with curves and smooth anchor points might get you used to 
smooth transitions from one line segment to another. Those anchor points 
are fairly easy to create. Just click and drag a new point, and whammo! You 
have a smooth anchor point. Both the curved-corner anchor point and the 
combination-corner anchor point are a little trickier, though: They always 
require two steps. Still, they can’t scare a veteran of the draggin’ wars. Not a bit. 
Curved-corner anchor points revisited
Because curved-corner anchor points have two curves sticking out of them 
(one on each side), they need two direction points (one for each curve). But 
because these points are anchoring independent curves, you have to make 
those direction points independent of each other. Here’s the move: While 
you’re dragging out a smooth anchor point, you can quickly change it into a 
curved-corner anchor point by pressing and releasing the Option key (Alt for 
Windows). Doing so “breaks” the control-handle lines into independent lines.
Be sure to make your original line segment the proper length and angle 
before you press Option/Alt. After you press the key, the only way to edit 
the line is to stop drawing and modify it with the Direct Selection tool. See 
Chapter 6 for all sorts of great tips on how to get the most out of point adjust-
ment by using the Direct Selection tool.
Combination-corner anchor points revisited
Using a similarly fancy move, you can create combination-corner points from 
smooth or straight-corner anchor points — while you’re drawing. Here’s how:
 
✓ To go from a straight line into a curved line, while you’re drawing a 
smooth anchor point, press Option/Alt after you click but before you 
release the mouse button. This action lets you drag the direction point 

146
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
for the next line segment without affecting the previous segment, as 
Illustrator normally does. To create the curve, drag the direction point 
to wherever you need it.
 
✓ To go from one curved line into another (with a curved-corner point 
instead of a smooth point), click and drag as though you were creating a 
smooth point. After you have the first curve how you want it, but before 
you release the mouse button, press Option/Alt. As soon as you press 
Option/Alt, the second direction point moves independently of the first. 
Use this keyboard technique to move the direction point to wherever 
you need it.
These two techniques take a little practice because so much depends on the 
timing of when you press Option/Alt. Don’t worry, though. If you don’t get it right 
the first time, you always have the Convert Anchor Point tool to fall back on.
Drawing Shapes with the Pen Tool
This section walks you through drawing some other basic shapes. Knowing 
the best ways to do that can make the more complex shapes much easier to 
draw. Take, for example, a garden-variety circle — shapes don’t get any sim-
pler than that . . . or do they? When you draw one in Illustrator, you can get 
widely differing results with the Pen tool.
Drawing a sad, lumpy circle with the Pen tool
You’re probably saying to yourself, “Why would anyone be foolish enough to 
draw a circle by using the Pen tool when you can draw a perfect circle in a 
single step by using the Ellipse tool?” (which I cover in Chapter 4). A couple 
of reasons are
 
✓ Practice makes perfect. A circle is an object made entirely of smooth 
anchor points. Master the circle, and you’re the master of smooth curves!
 
✓ The Ellipse tool makes perfect circles every time. Sometimes you might 
want to be a little more creative than that, and drawing the imperfect 
circle you want with the Pen tool can be a lot faster than modifying a 
perfect circle created with the Ellipse tool.
So, without further ado, follow these steps, as shown in Figure 7-13:
 
1. Hold down the Shift key, and click and drag to the right with the Pen 
tool; extend the direction point line about 1/4 inch.
 
2. Still pressing the Shift key, click about 1/2 inch above and to the right 
of the first anchor point, and drag up about 1/4 inch.
 
 You’ve drawn an eye-pleasing arc — kind of a skateboard-ramp sorta thing.

147
 Chapter 7: Wielding the Mighty Pen Tool
 
3. Keep pressing the Shift key, click about 1/2 inch above the second 
anchor point (directly above the first anchor point), and drag left 
about 1/4 inch.
 
 You’ve drawn a lovely half circle. You’re actually more than halfway there.
 
4. With your left hand developing a cramp from holding down the Shift 
key, click about 1/2 inch to the left of the first anchor point and directly 
opposite the second anchor point, and then drag down about 1/4 inch.
 
 You can probably guess where I’m going with this last click.
 
5. Click the first anchor point, drag to the right about 1/4 inch, and then 
(finally) release the Shift key.
 
 Your creation is a perfectly lumpy circle! If your circle isn’t as round as 
you want, select the Direct Selection tool (the hollow arrow) and tweak 
the points and direction points until the circle looks less lumpy.
 
 
Figure 7-13: Drawing a circle (sort of) by using the Pen tool.
 
Congratulations — you just drew a circle! Try drawing a second circle by 
using the same steps. And another. You’ll find that not only does each circle 
get easier and better, but you’ll have much more control whenever you 
create a smooth curve anywhere.
Drawing a heart
Ah, a real challenge. None of this “circle” stuff for you! Still, similarities to the 
circle abound. You do need four anchor points — two of them smooth points. 
And most of the anchor points need to be in similar positions to the anchor 
points you drew for the circle. Hmmm. Figure 7-14 shows the procedure in all 
its glory. Just complete the following steps:
 
1. Click and drag up and to the right about 1/4 inch.
 
2. Move your cursor about 3/4 inch above and 1/2 inch to the right of the 
first anchor point, and then click and drag up about 1/4 inch. Use the 
Shift key to constrain the angle of the direction point.
 
3. Move your cursor about 1/2 inch to the left and above the first anchor 
point, and then click and drag down and to the left about 1/4 inch.
 
 This procedure is almost too easy, isn’t it? Well, take heart (so to speak). 
The next step tests your mettle.

148
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
Figure 7-14: Drawing a heart with the Pen tool.
 
4. Press Option/Alt, click the direction point you just created (that was 
extending from the anchor point), and drag up about 1/2 inch.
 
 This action breaks the two control-handle lines and sets you up for a 
nice, curved-corner point at the top of the heart.
 
5. Move your cursor about 1/2 inch to the left of the last anchor point, and 
then click and drag straight down about 1/4 inch.
 
 Again, you can press the Shift key to make sure you’re dragging a per-
fectly vertical line.
 
6. Move your cursor onto the first point, press Option/Alt, and then click 
and drag down and to the right about 1/4 inch.
 
 This completes the heart.

n the beginning, there was the Pen tool. And users said that 
the Pen tool was good. But the users also said that the 
Pen tool was too hard. And too frustrating. And ineffi-
cient for quickly creating paths. And the users griped. 
And behold! Adobe gave them the Pencil tool — the 
wondrous, magical Pencil tool that makes creating 
paths as easy as drawing with a, well, pencil. And 
there was great rejoicing. But Adobe wasn’t content 
to stop there, blessing users with three other tools: 
the Line Segment, Arc, and Spiral tools.
In this chapter, you find out all about the Pencil 
tool and its buddies, theSmooth, Path Eraser, Line 
Segment, Arc, and Spiral tools. You discover how to 
create and modify paths as well as customize these tools 
to match your personal drawing style. And then you can 
join in the rejoicing!

Using the Pencil Tool as a Pencil
 
 Computer mice (mouses?) have never been good drawing tools; you need a 
steady hand and more patience than the guy at the mall in the Santa suit. 
That was then. These days, the Illustrator Pencil tool makes even the most 
hopped-up-on-caffeine, impatient Picasso-wannabe into a computer artist. 
(Just looking at it makes you feel better about drawing, doesn’t it?)
Minimal effort and hefty stress reduction
The whole idea behind the Pencil tool is to let you draw exactly what you want — 
as quickly or slowly as you want. Regardless of the speed at which you draw, the 
resulting path appears the same (a nice thought for those of us on a deadline).
The Pencil tool can create smooth lines even when you’re jittering around. 
(Unless you don’t want it to — in which case it makes funky, jittery lines.) 
The Pencil tool is also intuitive. Not only does looks like a pencil, but when you 
click and drag with it, it creates a line that more or less follows where you dragged, 
pretty much like using a real pencil. (For contrast, look at the Pen tool. It looks like 
a pen, and yet it does nothing even remotely penlike!) And it allows you to fix your 
mistakes without ever having to push or pull a point or a handle.
The following steps (deftly illustrated in Figure 8-1) show you how to use the 
Pencil tool:
 
1. Choose the Pencil tool from its 
slot in the Tools panel.
 
 Your cursor changes into (sur-
prise!) a pencil.
 
2. Click and drag in the 
Document window. As you 
drag, a dotted line appears.
 
 Think of these dots as bread-
crumbs that show you where 
you’ve been.
 
3. Release the mouse button after 
you amass a nice little trail of 
breadcrumbs (dots).
 
 A path forms where the bread-
crumbs were. (If Hansel and 
Gretel had used the Pencil tool, 
that poor witch would be alive 
today.)
Figure 8-1: Drawing with the Pencil tool.

151
 Chapter 8: Creating Straight and Curved Lines without the Pen Tool
  If you stop drawing with the Pencil tool, you can just start up where you 
left off simply by clicking at the end of the path and continuing. Be careful, 
though. If you don’t click close enough to the end of the path, you start a 
whole new path. Fortunately, the Pencil tool tells you when you’re in the 
right place. When you’re creating a new path, a little X appears to the right of 
the tip of the Pencil (shown at the bottom in the margin). When you’re close 
enough to a selected path to add to it, the X disappears (shown at the top in 
the margin).
A few unexpected exceptions to all this bliss
You’re right. Using the Pencil tool does sound too easy. Although the Pencil 
tool is undeniably wonderful, it can cause frustration (or at least uncertainty) 
in the unwary. Here are instances to watch out for (and avoid if possible):
 
✓ You can’t continue your path. You need to select a path in order to add to 
it. For example, if you stop drawing, do something that deselects the path, 
and then return to drawing your path, you create a second path instead of 
extending the first one. To continue the path you were originally working 
on, you must select it before you start drawing again with the Pencil tool. 
Press the Ô key (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows) to access the Selection tool, then 
click the path, let go of the Ô key (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows) and then start 
drawing, starting at either end of the newly selected path.
 
 To get to the selection cursor right away, hold down Ô/Ctrl.
 
✓ You accidentally edit an existing path. If you start a new Pencil path 
near a selected path, you can edit the selected path instead of creat-
ing a new one. In fact, you can do so with any path that was created 
with the Pen, Pencil, Line Segment, Arc, Spiral, Star, or any other tool 
in Illustrator. You can edit any of them with the Pencil tool. (So is the 
Pencil versatile or overzealous? Your call.)
 
✓ You create a path that’s too lumpy or too smooth. You can set up the 
Pencil tool to be very smooth or very accurate. (In this case, accurate 
really means that it follows all the skittles and bumps you make as you 
draw). If someone you love changes the Pencil tool preferences (which 
you can access by double-clicking the Pencil tool), the Pencil retains those 
settings. Pencil tool preferences are loyal to the most recent user; they 
never return to their original settings unless you manually change them.
 
✓ You get a wacky fill or stroke while you draw. This situation really isn’t 
the Pencil tool’s fault, but it’s not exactly unknown to habitual Pencil tool 
users. If, before you start to draw, a nameless somebody sets the fill or 
stroke to something a little odd, boom! you get a mess. Fortunately, you 
can change the fill or stroke back to the default settings by pressing D. 
Before you know it, you’re back to normal. (Well, at least the path is. . . .)
 

152
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ You can’t close a path. Often when you use the Pencil tool in an attempt 
to create a closed path (by ending the path where you started), you 
wind up with two points that are very close to one another without 
actually being joined. For some reason, the Pencil tool has a hard time 
making a closed path if you draw the entire path with one continuous 
stroke. When you near the end of the path, hold down the Option key 
(Mac)/Alt (Windows) and then release the mouse with Option/Alt still 
pressed when the end of the line you’re drawing is near the beginning. 
The two ends of your path will be joined.
 
✓ You can’t draw a straight line. In Illustrator, pressing the Shift key 
doesn’t keep the Pencil tool on a horizontal or vertical plane. Just 
about every other tool in Illustrator draws or moves in straight lines at 
45° angles. In fact, just about every other tool in every Adobe product 
moves or draws in straight lines when you hold down Shift! But the 
Pencil tool can’t even think straight! Fortunately, you can switch over 
to the Pen tool to draw straight lines and then switch back to the Pencil 
tool to create the rest of the drawing.
Cherishing the Multipurpose Pencil Tool
If you ever had one of those pocketknives with enough blades to do or fix 
anything, you can appreciate how much more the Pencil tool does than a 
mere pencil! Use the amazing Pencil tool to edit existing paths, create new 
paths, append one path to another, and close existing paths.
 
 But wait, there’s more! You can tweak Pencil tool preferences to reflect how 
you want to draw. You can also use the Smooth tool and the Eraser tool 
(hidden in the Pencil toolslot), which are both handy variations on the Pencil 
tool. Use the Smooth tool (a striped pencil) to make paths less bumpy, with 
nary a smear. Use the Eraser tool (an upside-down pencil) to zap away por-
tions of paths, leaving no rubber crumbs to get into your keyboard.
Making the Pencil tool work just for you
Set preferences for the Pencil tool by double-clicking the Pencil tool in the 
Tools panel; this opens the Pencil Tool Options dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 8-2. Straight out of the box, the Pencil tool works pretty well. To be 
honest, although it’s really set up to work reasonably well for everyone, it 
might not be set up to work as well as it possibly can for you.
Hi-fi and lo-fi paths
The first slider under Tolerances (at the top of the dialog box; refer to Figure 
8-2) is Fidelity. Nope, nothing to do with divorce courts. This kind of fidelity 
 
 
 
 

153
 Chapter 8: Creating Straight and Curved Lines without the Pen Tool
affects how closely the path follows 
where you drag the Pencil tool. 
A high setting (slider toward the 
left) means that the path matches 
precisely what you drew with the 
Pencil, adding as many points and 
corners as necessary. A low setting 
(slider toward the right) means that 
the path loosely follows what you 
drew, making a smoother line with 
fewer points. Paths created with the 
Fidelity slider all the way to the left 
appear more natural and bumpy; 
paths drawn with the slider all the 
way to the right appear smoother 
but more computer-like.
Compare the images shown in Figure 8-3. The path on the left was drawn with 
a Fidelity setting of .5 pixel; the path on the right was drawn with a Fidelity 
setting of 20 pixels. This Fidelity setting isn’t just an arbitrary special effect; 
it’s a way to make the Pencil tool match your personal drawing style.
 
 
Figure 8-3: (Left) High Fidelity. (Right) Low Fidelity.
 
Fidelity is measured in pixels. A pixel can mean many things as a unit of mea-
surement. In this case, a pixel refers to a distance on your screen. (For more 
information, see the sidebar “Just how big IS a pixel?”)
Drawing with a mouse is about as easy as drawing with a brick; the lines you 
make tend to be pretty shaky. The Fidelity slider determines how shaky your 
Figure 8-2: Set Pencil tool attributes here.

154
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
hand can be and still produce a smooth line. When you use the Pencil tool, 
you create a breadcrumb trail (a dotted line). After you release the mouse 
button, your computer pauses for a split second to create an imaginary line 
that’s the average of all the movement you just made with the mouse. Then 
Illustrator compares that imaginary line with your breadcrumb trail and cre-
ates the actual path based on the Fidelity slider’s setting.
Suppose that your Fidelity setting is 20 pixels — the highest Fidelity set-
ting possible. As you draw your naturally shaky line, you move away from 
the imaginary average line. With a setting of 20 pixels, Illustrator assumes 
that everything less than 20 pixels away from that imaginary line is unin-
tentional shaking, induced by the unwieldy nature of the mouse (or by too 
much caffeine), so Illustrator just ignores that stuff when it creates the 
path. Everything more than 20 pixels away is considered intentional, which 
prompts Illustrator to put in a curve or a corner point.
All this is just an extended way of saying that if you’re at one with yourself 
and the Universe and are a Zen master of mouse movement, you want to keep 
your Fidelity settings high. That way, you move the mouse only to exactly 
where you want the path, and you don’t have Illustrator second-guessing 
what you really intended. However, if you have really shaky hands (as most 
of us do when we get too much caffeine and not enough sleep), you prob-
ably want to use a low Fidelity setting. More than likely, you fall somewhere 
between these two extremes. So just double-click the Pencil tool and set the 
Fidelity slider to match your style!
Now, that is smooth!
The second slider of the Pencil Tool Options dialog box (refer to Figure 8-2) 
is a little harder for most people to figure out. After all, it’s named Smoothness — 
but didn’t the first slider (Fidelity) smooth out the image? 
Just how big IS a pixel?
That question has no easy answer, my friend. 
In the olden days, a pixel was 1/72 of an inch 
because computer screens used a fixed grid of 
72 pixels x 72 pixels for every inch of screen. 
Nowadays, multisync monitors allow us to change 
the number of pixels on the screen. How big is a 
pixel? Take the current resolution of your moni-
tor, divide by its size, and then. . . . Better yet, 
forget all that and just pay attention to how the 
Pencil tool works with different Fidelity settings. 
Choose the one that works best for you, and 
don’t worry about the numbers!

155
 Chapter 8: Creating Straight and Curved Lines without the Pen Tool
Here’s the difference. Because drawing with the mouse can be pretty shaky, 
this setting helps compensate for the shakiness in a slightly different way 
from the Fidelity setting. The Fidelity setting helps Illustrator determine 
whether you drew the path because you meant to or because you had a 
shaky mouse. Comparatively, the Smoothness setting helps Illustrator figure 
out what kind of corner you meant to create when you deliberately changed 
the direction of the path.
When you change the direction of a path, you can make a sharp corner point 
or a smooth, curving point. When Illustrator converts your breadcrumb trail 
into a path, it must determine which of these points you truly intended to 
use. A low Smoothness setting (say, 0%) makes the Pencil tool use a corner 
point almost everywhere that the path changes direction. A high Smoothness 
setting (say, 100%) makes the Pencil tool use a smooth point in all but the 
most extreme path direction changes.
The setting that works best for you is a matter of your personal style. If your 
lines are as shaky as a balloon vendor at a porcupine convention, set your 
Smoothness setting to 100%. If your hands are as steady as a gunslinger in a 
Western movie, leave it set to 0%. Experiment until you find the right setting 
for you. Figure 8-4 shows the same image created with different Smoothness 
settings. Note how the settings change the way the drawings look.
 
 
 Figure 8-4: At left, a Smoothness setting of 0%; at right, a Smoothness 
setting of 100%.
At first glance, the differences between the drawings on the right in Figures 8-3 
(low Fidelity) and 8-4 (high Smoothness) appear minimal. However, looks can 

156
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
be deceiving. The Smoothness and Fidelity settings are actually two distinct 
approaches to making a path: A low Fidelity setting creates a simplified curve 
by following the path you draw more loosely and using fewer points; a high 
Smoothness setting creates a smoother curve by using different types of points 
(smooth points as opposed to corner points) to create the path. Which is 
better? It really depends on your drawing style — and some experimenting!
Tweaking the Pencil tool: It’s your option
Under the Options section of the Pencil Tool Options dialog box, you find 
three options: Fill New Pencil Strokes, Keep Selected and Edit Selected Paths. 
These settings determine what happens to the path after you draw it and 
how the Pencil tool interacts with that path (or with other selected paths).
 
✓ With Fill New Pencil Strokes checked: You end up with the fill color 
specified in the Tools panel as a fill for any path you draw with the Pencil 
tool. Uncheck this and your Pencil-drawn paths will have a fill of None.
 
✓ With Keep Selected checked: The path you just created with the Pencil 
tool stays selected after you finish drawing and release the mouse button.
 
✓ With Keep Selected unchecked: The path you just created doesn’t stay 
selected. (But you knew that.)
The Keep Selected option also determines how the Pencil tool affects 
selected paths, as follows:
 
✓ Edit Selected Paths: When you use the Pencil tool near any selected 
path (with the Keep Selected option checked), the path you just drew 
with the Pencil tool replaces the previous path. You can even adjust 
how close you need to be to that path to edit it; just tweak the Within 
setting, located just beneath the Edit Selected Paths option.
 
 When the Edit Selected Paths option is not checked, the Pencil tool works 
the same regardless of whether Keep Selected is checked or unchecked. 
When the Edit Selected Paths option is checked, it changes the way the 
Pencil tool works. Instead of moving on to create a new path when you 
draw near a selected path, you linger over the old one to modify it.
 
✓ With Keep Selected checked: You can start drawing a path, stop, and 
then continue where you left off. If you decide to replace the path, you 
can place the Pencil tool near the path you just drew and start drawing 
a new one. (Poof. The old one disappears.) But beware: You have forbid-
den the Pencil tool to draw multiple paths that are close together.
 
✓ With Keep Selected and Edit Selected Paths checked: Every stroke you 
make that’s close to another selected stroke replaces the old stroke with 
the new stroke.

157
 Chapter 8: Creating Straight and Curved Lines without the Pen Tool
 
✓ With Keep Selected unchecked: The Pencil tool can change only the 
paths you tell it to change (by first using a selection tool). By remov-
ing the check mark from Keep Selected, you enable the Pencil to draw 
hair or grass (for instance) with utter abandon. With Keep Selected 
unchecked you can also edit hair or grass, but don’t forget to select the 
part you want to edit (by first using a selection tool).
Changing the path not penciled
A really amazing attribute of the Pencil tool is that you can use it to edit 
any path, and not just the paths created with it. For example, you can edit a 
circle, star, or path drawn with the Pen tool. You can replace any portion of 
any path with the Pencil tool, provided that the path is selected and the Edit 
Selected Path option is checked in the Pencil Tool Preferences dialog box. 
(See “Making the Pencil tool work just for you” earlier in this chapter.) Just 
make sure that the path is selected, and then click and drag near the path to 
reshape it. The following steps walk you through the process of editing an 
existing path:
 
1. Using any selection tool, select the path you want to modify.
 
 The path need not have been created with the Pencil tool.
 
2. Select the Pencil tool.
 
3. Click near the part of the path you want to modify.
 
 When the little X at the bottom right of the Pencil tool disappears, you 
know that you’re close enough to click.
 
4. Click and drag a new shape for the part of the path.
 
 You can create any shape you want, but it must start and end near the 
existing path; otherwise, the new path won’t reconnect with the old path.
 
5. Release the mouse button.
 
 The path reshapes itself into the new path you just drew.
Working with the all-natural “Smoothie” tool
Use the Illustrator Smooth tool (found in the Pencil toolslot) to make your 
paths, well, smoother. (Not that you need me to tell you that, huh?) Use the 
Smooth tool to change how a path looks after it’s drawn, in the same way that 
the Pencil tool lets you change the way a path looks while it’s being drawn.
Drag the Smooth tool over any selected path to smooth it. You aren’t limited 
to smoothing paths drawn with the Pencil tool; you can smooth any path in 

158
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Illustrator. Your results, however, depend on the path that you’re smoothing 
(for example, if you try smoothing a path that’s already smooth, you aren’t 
going to see much difference) and on the Smooth tool preferences.
You access the Smooth tool preferences by double-clicking the Smooth tool. 
The only two settings are Fidelity and Smoothness. These settings function 
identically to the settings in the Pencil Tool Options dialog box. (See the ear-
lier section, “Making the Pencil tool work just for you.”) The only difference is 
that you apply these settings to lines that are already drawn. Just sweep over 
them with the Smooth tool, and the result is as if you drew those paths by 
using different Pencil tool preferences settings.
As you may expect, using the Smooth tool is pretty smooth. Here’s the drill 
(or is it a sander?), as shown in Figure 8-5:
 
1. Using any selection tool, select the path that you want to smooth.
 
2. Drag the Smooth tool on or near the path that you want to smooth.
 
 Et voilá! The path is smooth.
 
 
Figure 8-5: The Smooth tool in action.
 
The Path Eraser tool (also found in the Pencil toolslot) is so basic that it 
doesn’t even warrant its own section. To use the tool, simply click and drag 
the tool over the portion of the path you want to remove. It might take a 
couple of swipes to eliminate what you want, so be patient. The Path Eraser 
tool also works with any path — not just those created with the Pencil tool. 
Also, with the Path Eraser tool, you don’t have to set preferences.
In addition to the Path Eraser tool, there is also a regular Eraser tool in 
Illustrator. It’s easy to get them confused, but they do quite different things. 
The Eraser tool works more like a real eraser, erasing away portions of your 
artwork regardless of the paths below it. The Path Eraser tool just erases 
paths.

159
 Chapter 8: Creating Straight and Curved Lines without the Pen Tool
Using the Pen with the Pencil
The Pen and Pencil tools are the primary tools for drawing in Illustrator, and 
they work really well together. As you gain a knack for knowing which tool to 
use when, your work flows more smoothly, and your illustrations look more 
and more how you want.
Swapping one tool for another
A common technique that’s useful for combining the Pen and Pencil tools is 
to switch between them while drawing. You could click each tool whenever 
you decide to change from one to the other, but the really zippy way to do 
this is to press the key that corresponds to each tool. Just press the P key 
(on your keyboard) to switch to the Pen tool, and press N to switch to the 
Pencil tool.
As your drawing changes from free-flowing curves to precise straight lines 
and back, you want to change between the two tools: Just click the endpoint 
of the path you were previously drawing with the other tool and then con-
tinue drawing.
 
Watch those icons! Working with the Pen and Pencil tools together is much 
easier if you pay attention to what the icons are doing. When the Pen tool is 
over an endpoint, a little slash (/) appears to the lower right of the pen icon. 
When you’re about to close a path, a hollow circle appears beside the tool. 
When you have the Pencil tool in position to edit a path, its icon doesn’t have 
anything beside it. Both tools, however, get Xs beside them when they’re 
about to create a new path.
Precision versus speed: You make the call
Keep in mind the types of shapes and paths that are best drawn with each 
tool. Here’s a breakdown of the shapes and paths each tool draws best.
Shapes and paths best drawn with the Pen tool
To draw anything with straight lines, choose the Pen tool because the Pencil 
tool really can’t draw a straight line. To create a path or shape that has a 
smooth curve, you choose the Pen tool because the line the Pencil tool cre-
ates is just an average of the total strokes you make, which means absolute 
precision is impossible. Finally, to trace a logo or other scanned art that 
requires precision and accuracy, you’re better off choosing the Pen tool 
because it offers you precision down to the thousandth of a millimeter.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Shapes and paths best drawn with the Pencil tool
When speed is more important than accuracy in your drawing — when you 
need to put a lot of hairs onto your lovely kiwi-fruit illustration, for example, 
and the precise length and position of each and every hair doesn’t matter — 
choose the Pencil tool. For quick sketching, such as doodling an insulting 
picture of your favorite co-worker, choose the Pencil tool because you don’t 
have to worry about each and every point and handle the way you do with 
the Pen tool. The Pencil tool lets you focus on creating the lines where 
they should be — and lets Illustrator do the rest of the work for you. (Ah, 
progress.)
Lines Made Quick and Easy
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you know you can’t draw a straight 
line with the Pencil tool, and you’ve seen how tedious using the Pen tool can be. 
So, you’re probably thinking that drawing a line would be easier with that gloppy 
rapidograph pen and a metal ruler. Don’t fret! The powers-that-be at Adobe 
have bestowed yet another tool for pen-phobic users: the Line Segment tool. 
With the Line Segment tool, you can make lines quickly and easily.
Working with the Line Segment tool
 
 To create a line with the Line Segment tool, simply select the tool from the 
Tools panel, click at your desired starting point, drag, and then release at 
your desired ending point. (You can also click anywhere on your Artboard — 
the drawing area of the screen that will print, defined by a black border — 
with the Line Segment tool selected, then enter a desired angle and length in 
the Line Segment Tool Options dialog box that appears, and then click OK.)
Like most things that are super easy, the using Line Segment tool has its 
drawbacks. For example, you’re limited to creating a single line, as shown 
in Figure 8-6. You can’t create connecting lines like you can with the Pen 
or Pencil tools. You can, however, create lines that are perfectly vertical, 
horizontal, or at 45° angles. Just press the Shift key while you draw. You’ll 
discover that when you drag your cursor, your line constrains to a 45° angle. 
After you create your line, you can edit it by selecting and moving either end-
point with the Direct Selection tool.

Figure 8-6: Line Segment tool lines are easy, but limited to single strokes.
Setting the tool options
Double-clicking the Line Segment tool in the 
Tools panel brings up the Line Segment Tool 
Options dialog box, shown in Figure 8-7. Not 
exactly one of the feature-rich dialog boxes out 
there, the Line Segment Tool Options dialog box 
offers only three options: Length, Angle, and 
Fill Line. When you deselect the Fill Line option, 
the line appears with only a stroke, regardless 
of whether you have a fill selected in the Tools 
panel or the Color panel. After you complete the 
drawing of your line, the Fill swatch in both the Tools 
panel and the Color panel automatically reverts to None.

Tool Options dialog box.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Curvy with the Arc Tool
In Chapter 7, I tell you how to create a curve with the Pen tool — a some-
times painful two-step click-and-drag process. With the Arc tool (found in the 
Line Segment toolslot), all you do is just click and drag. The longer you drag, 
the larger the arc. The angle you drag affects the angle of the arc. That’s it. 
If only everything in life were so simple. To edit your arc, treat it is as you 
would any other curve. Use the Direct Selection tool to select and move 
either of the anchor points or direction points on the curve. See Chapter 6 for 
the complete editing lowdown.
Getting the arc you want
Maybe you’re the finicky type and 
not completely satisfied with the arc 
created by using the default settings. 
Fortunately, the options in the Arc 
Segment Tool Options dialog box are 
numerous. Double-click the Arc tool 
to bring up the dialog box shown 
in Figure 8-8. The best thing about 
this dialog box is that it gives you a 
preview of the settings as you adjust 
them.
The preview thumbnail gives a 
nice visual representation of what 
happens to the arc as you change the lengths of the X (horizontal) and Y 
(vertical) axes. You have the choice of the type of arc — open (like a rain-
bow) or closed (think a slice of pizza). You can also choose where the base 
of your arc is anchored — either the X or Y axis. The slope slider allows you 
to adjust how concave (pushed in) 
or convex (pushed out) your curve 
appears. Figure 8-9 shows examples 
of both concave and convex closed 
arcs. Deselect the Fill Arc option to 
create arcs with no fill, regardless of 
whether a fill is selected. The small 
square to the left of the OK button 
is a proxy box, which allows you to 
specify the point of origin for the arc.
 
When you select the Arc tool and click your Artboard, the Arc Segment Tool 
Options dialog box appears (just like it did when you double-clicked the Arc 
tool). When you click OK, an arc is drawn with the settings you established in 
the dialog box . . . no dragging required!

 Chapter 8: Creating Straight and Curved Lines without the Pen Tool
Spiraling out of control
Spirals are notoriously hard to draw — that is, without using the Spiral tool. 
With the Pen tool, you have to set up a complex grid and align points and 
direction points until the cows came home, had a good night’s rest, went to 
work for the day, and then came home yet again. It’s really, really hard. But 
the Spiral tool (found in the Line Segment toolslot) allows you to quickly 
create all sorts of snazzy-looking spirals from a loose-looking galaxy or whirl-
pool to the super-tight grooves on a 45 rpm record (ask your grandparents, 
kids). Figure 8-10 shows some spirally artwork created primarily with the 
Spiral tool.
 
 
Figure 8-10: Spirals created with the Spiral tool.
To customize a spiral, hold down one of the following keys while you drag:
 
✓ Up/Down Arrow: Adds or deletes the winds of the spiral as you’re 
drawing it.
 
✓ Ô (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows): Winds or unwinds the spiral (the outside 
moves, but the center stays where it is, making the spiral tighter or 
looser), which changes the number of winds.

164
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Spacebar: Allows you to move the spiral around with the mouse while 
you draw it.
 
✓ Tilde (~): Creates multiple spirals while you draw.
Click the Artboard with the Spiral 
tool selected (instead of clicking and 
dragging) to open the Spiral dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 8-11. Here 
are the options:
 
✓ Radius: This option sets the 
distance from the center of the 
spiral to its outermost point.
 
✓ Decay: This option determines 
how much larger or smaller 
each coil of the spiral is from 
the previous coil. Values close 
to 100% result in a tight spiral, 
and 100% results in a perfect 
circle. Figure 8-12 shows a spiral 
with a decay of 75% and one 
with 95%, with the exact some 
radius and segments.
 
✓ Segments: This option determines how many coils make up the spiral. 
Each wind of the spiral is made of four segments; thus, if you want five 
coils in your spiral, type 20 in the Segments field.
 
✓ Style: The Style options control whether the spiral is clockwise or 
counterclockwise.
 
 
 Figure 8-12: The green spiral on the left has a decay of 75%, while 
the purple spiral on the right has a decay of 95%.

box to set the spiral’s tightness.

Creating Magnificent Brushstrokes
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why the Paintbrush is unlike the Pen and Pencil tools
▶ Creating brushes from Illustrator artwork
▶ Looking at the four brush types
H
ardcore users of Illustrator would never call it a painting program. So 
what if you can mix colors and use a paintbrush tool? To hardcore 
users, painting programs are what you’d call 1980’s pixel-based, crudlike 
SuperPaint and MacPaint. Only drawing and illustration programs are vector 
based. Regardless of what the hardcore users think, Illustrator has some of 
the most powerful painting capabilities of any graphics program, vector- or 
pixel-based.
 
 
What, for example, would you call this tool in the margin? In Illustrator, its 
name is the Paintbrush tool, but it’s also at least one-third magic wand (the 
kind magicians use, not the Illustrator Magic Wand tool). In this chapter, you 
discover the magic of the Paintbrush tool and the wonders of 
vector-based brush strokes. You get to push the definitions 
of “brush” by creating brushstrokes of every conceivable 
size and shape, from brushes that make simple cal-
ligraphic strokes to brushes that make strokes using 
other Illustrator artwork.
Brushing Where No Stroke 
Has Gone Before
Brushes are wildly creative strokes that you can 
apply to paths. If you think of them this way, brushes 
become much easier to get a handle on (especially if 
they make you, er, bristle with frustration).
Brushes come in four types: Art, Scatter, Calligraphic, or Pattern 
brushes. Figure 9-1 shows (left to right) examples of painting with an Art 
brush, a Scatter brush, a Calligraphic brush, and a Pattern brush.

166
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
Figure 9-1: Art, Scatter, Calligraphic, and Pattern brush painting examples.
 
✓ Art brushes: Stretch a single piece of artwork along an entire path.
 
✓ Scatter brushes: Scatter artwork around a path. The artwork is repeated, 
scaled, and rotated randomly. The Scatter 
brush is oddly similar to the Symbol 
Sprayer, but you find distinct differences, 
which I point out later in this chapter.
 
✓ Calligraphic brushes: Emulate drawing or 
writing with a calligraphy pen.
 
✓ Pattern brushes: Repeat artwork along a 
path that you draw with the Paintbrush 
tool. Unlike the random Scatter brush, the 
Pattern brush repeats the artwork in a 
precise pattern.
The Illustrator Brushes panel, shown in Figure 
9-2, contains samples of each of the four brush 
types. (Choose Window➪Brushes to display the 
Brushes panel.) In addition, see the “Creating a 
New Brush” section later in this chapter for help 
on taking virtually anything that you create in 
Illustrator and turning it into a brush.
There’s also another brush, which isn’t a brush but still is called a brush, pre-
cisely to confuse you. It’s a Blob brush, which I discuss at the end of this chap-
ter. Until then, forget I even mentioned it.

 Chapter 9: Creating Magnificent Brushstrokes
Embracing your inner artist
Regardless of your artistic background or intentions, you can make astound-
ing artwork when using the Paintbrush tool with different brush types. Of 
course, someone with an utter vacuum of talent (or more than the legally 
allowed measure of bad taste) might face an uphill battle to create something 
that looks good. Even so, you can quickly whip up some snazzy images, like 
the one in Figure 9-3, by using the Paintbrush — even if you’re new to com-
puter graphics. (Your secret is safe with me.) Just follow these steps:
 
 
1. Choose the Paintbrush tool from the Tools panel.
 
 
 Your cursor changes into a little paintbrush.
 
2. Choose Window➪Brush Libraries➪Artistic➪Artistic Watercolor.
 
 After you release the mouse button, the Artistic Watercolor brush panel 
appears quicker than you can say Wassily Kandinsky. (Um, he was a 
famous Russian artist who used watercolors. Really.)
 
3. Click the topmost brush, “Light wash – thick.”
 
4. Click and drag with the Paintbrush tool to draw a path where you 
want your new stroke to be.
 
5. Release the mouse button.
 
 The path becomes the stroke of the brush that you chose. In this case, 
the Watercolor Art brush’s gray, watery stroke stretches along the 
entire length of the path. Change the stroke color and draw some more 
strokes. Because of the partial transparency of the Watercolor strokes, 
the effect is mesmerizing.
 
 
Figure 9-3: Create some wild and wacky strokes.

168
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
Because brushes reside on paths, you can change the position and dimen-
sions of any brushstroke just like you modify any path. You can use the 
Pencil tool to reshape an existing path. Or, if you’re really brave, you can use 
the Direct Selection tool to push and pull points and handles around until the 
brushstroke looks how you want.
The Paintbrush 
tool options
The Paintbrush tool offers several 
options that you can use to custom-
ize how it draws. All these options 
are found in the Paintbrush Tool 
Preferences dialog box, shown in 
Figure 9-4, which appears after you 
double-click the Paintbrush tool. 
These preferences function almost 
identically to the Pencil tool prefer-
ences, with one exception: the Fill 
New Brush Strokes option. When you 
leave the check box for this option 
unchecked (which I recommend), 
Illustrator automatically sets the Fill 
color option to None. For a more 
exhaustive and exhausting explanation 
of the other settings, refer to Chapter 8 
where I discuss the Pencil tool prefer-
ences. The options are exactly the 
same in both name and function.
 
Why set the Fill color option to None? The path you make with the 
Paintbrush tool can contain a fill color, but brushstrokes can also be ran-
domly placed pieces of artwork or have unique shapes. The stroke can 
appear partly inside and partly outside the fill color, which makes the fill 
seem random and unrelated to your stroke. Brushes work better when you 
don’t use a fill color with them.
Creating a New Brush
Although Illustrator ships with several hundred brushes, obsessively creative 
folks can’t stand to be limited to so few. To create your own brushes, go right 
ahead by using darn near any set of paths in Illustrator. (I’m using the art I 
created from Figure 9-3 as a new brush because I think it’ll be really nifty.) 
Furthermore, you can use the process to create a new Art, Pattern, or Scatter 
brush — just not a Calligraphic brush, which doesn’t require external artwork.
Figure 9-4: The Paintbrush Tool Preferences 
dialog box.

 Chapter 9: Creating Magnificent Brushstrokes
 
1. Create (or open a document with) artwork that you want to use as a brush.
 
2. Select all the paths in the document by choosing Select➪Select All.
 
3. Click the New Brush button or choose New Brush from the Brushes 
panel pop-up menu.
 
 This button, located at the 
bottom of the Brushes panel, 
looks like a piece of paper. Refer 
to Figure 9-2.
 
 The New Brush dialog box (as 
shown in Figure 9-5) appears 
and asks what type of brush you 
want to create.
 
4. Select New Art Brush, New Scatter Brush, or New Pattern Brush; then 
click OK.
 
 For this example, I select the New Art Brush option.
 
 The Art Brush Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-6.
 
 
Figure 9-6: Create a new brush here.
 
5. Click OK to accept the default settings.
 
 If you’d like, you can name the brush first, but I find that doing so gets 
you emotionally attached to the brush in ways that classically trained 
artists tend to frown upon.
Figure 9-5: The New Brush dialog box.

170
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
If you’re concerned about accepting the default settings in the Art Brush 
Options dialog box, you can always make changes to the Art Brush 
options by double-clicking the Art brush itself in the Brushes panel. I 
talk about all those different options in the upcoming section, “Working 
with the Different Brush Types.” These options have the same effect 
whether you’re creating a new brush or modifying an existing one.
 
 The new Art brush appears in the Brushes panel, ready for you to use.
 
You can create all sorts of interesting effects by using text as Art brushes. 
Because brushes can contain only paths (not text objects), you must first 
change the text into paths before you can make it into a brush. Select the text 
object with a selection tool and then choose Type➪Create Outlines to effect 
the transformation from text to path.
Working with the Different Brush Types
This section looks at the four brush types and examines some of the options 
you can use when painting with them.
Art brushes for times when you’re a bit wacky
Art brushes take any Illustrator paths and stretch them along a (different) 
path. Figure 9-7 shows the Art Brush I created in Figure 9-6 after I applied it 
along multiple paths.
You can use several Art Brush options to make Art brushes look exactly how 
you want. Figure 9-8 shows the Art Brush Options dialog box, accessed by 
double-clicking any Art brush in the Brushes panel.
In the Art Brush Options dialog box, you can find a variety of options to affect 
how the brush makes a stroke. The following list describes how to use some 
of those options:
 
✓ Name: Give the brush a descriptive name here. This name appears when 
you choose View by Name from the Brushes panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ Preview: Select the Preview option to see any stroke in your artwork that 
uses the brush stroke you’re changing. What you see is what you get: that 
is, the stroke as it will look if you apply the new changes. This doesn’t 
alter your actual artwork. This feature is extremely handy because you 
don’t have to remember what all the different settings do — just watch 
what happens after you change them!

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Width: Enter a scaling percentage in the Width box, if that fits your 
needs.
 
✓ Proportional: When you select this check box, the artwork grows wider 
as the path gets longer. Keep the check box clear, and the artwork 
stretches as the path gets longer.
 
✓ Direction: These options determine whether the graphic rotates clock-
wise or counterclockwise (relative to the path) as you stretch it.
 
✓ Flip: These options resemble the Direction options except that they 
invert the artwork instead of rotating it.
 
✓ Colorization: Brushes have fill and stroke colors of their own. They are 
ordinary Illustrator artwork endowed with the power to be brushes, 
meaning that distinct fill and stroke values are part of the deal. The 
Colorization setting determines whether the brush keeps the colors of 
the original artwork or replaces them with Fill and Stroke colors from 
the Tools panel. A Method setting of None preserves the original art-
work’s colors. Other settings blend the fill and stroke colors with the 
artwork. How they perform this miracle depends on the colors in the 
original artwork for the brush and on the specific options you choose. 
As for the Key Color option, it lets you select a color from within the 
brush to base all colorization changes on.
 
 
Click the Tips button (the little light bulb in the corner) for a visual illus-
tration of the various colorization settings.
Figure 9-9 shows an Art Brush applied to a bunch of different paths.
 
 
Figure 9-9: The same brush applied to different paths produces variations like these.
Scatter brushes for times when you’re a bit wacky
Scatter brushes are similar to Art brushes in that they are also made up of 
Illustrator paths. However, the similarities end there. Instead of stretching 
art along a path, Scatter brushes toss, fling, and, well, scatter art along a path. 
Figure 9-10 shows the result of using a Scatter brush.

173
 Chapter 9: Creating Magnificent Brushstrokes
 
 
Figure 9-10: This artwork is actually a single path used as a Scatter brush.
 
Scatter brushes have even more options than Art brushes, but Scatter 
brushes need more options. Imagine a brush of randomly scattered ladybugs 
becoming a brush of organized ladybugs that follow the path you create with 
the brush. To access the options of a Scatter brush, double-click any exist-
ing Scatter brush to view the Scatter Brush options dialog box. (You see the 
same options when you create a new Scatter brush.)
The Scatter brushes repeat and randomize artwork based on four vari-
ables: Size, Spacing, Scatter, and Rotation. You set the specific amounts for 
these options by dragging their respective sliders to the left or right. How 
the brush uses each of these values is determined by the method (Fixed, 
Random, or Pressure) that you select in the drop-down list boxes to the right 
of each slider. The following list describes how each method works:
 
✓ Fixed: This method uses the exact value in the associated text box, 
which you specify by using the slider.
 
✓ Random: This method gives you two sliders with which you can specify 
Minimum and Maximum amounts of variance in the associated option. 
For example, after you set the Size to a Minimum value of 50% and a 
Maximum value to 200%, the Scatter brush varies the artwork randomly 
between half its original size and twice its original size.
 
✓ Pressure: Like with Random, Pressure uses Minimum and Maximum 
amounts of variance in the associated option. This method works only 
when you have a pressure-sensitive tablet hooked to your computer. This 
feature is so cool that you might want to run out and buy one of these 
tablets, which is sort of using a mouse except that you draw with a pen-
like stylus. Instead of just painting or not painting (your only options with 
a mouse), the stylus recognizes just how hard you press. The Minimum 
and Maximum settings correspond to the amount of pressure. The lightest 
pressure uses the Minimum value; the hardest pressure uses the Maximum 
value. The values you get vary according to just how hard you press.

174
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Two versions of the Scatter Brush Options dialog box appear in Figure 9-11. Next 
to each version is a brushstroke created with the option settings shown in the 
dialog box.
 
 
 Figure 9-11: Two versions of the Scatter Brush Options dialog box and the artwork resulting 
from those options.

175
 Chapter 9: Creating Magnificent Brushstrokes
After you determine which method to use, set the sliders on the left of the 
dialog box to specify how you want the artwork repeated along the path. 
Here are the options:
 
✓ Size: This option controls the 
size of the scattered objects 
relative to the original.
 
✓ Spacing: This option controls the 
amount of space that appears 
between the scattered objects.
 
✓ Scatter: This option controls 
how far away objects can scat-
ter on either side of the path.
 
✓ Rotation: This option controls 
how the objects are rotated 
and whether they’re rotated in 
relation to the path or to the 
document. Figure 9-12 shows 
the difference between a Scatter 
brush rotation based on the 
path (left) and one based on the 
page (right). The Scatter brush 
on the left is set to rotate at 90° 
relative to the path; the one on 
the right is set to rotate at 90° 
relative to the page.
There are glaring similarities between using the Symbol Sprayer (discussed 
in detail in Chapter 4) and Scatter brushes. The results are often visually 
identical, and the process of making Scatter brushes is much like creating a 
symbol. Table 9-1 lists the differences between the two.

Pattern brushes — too cool and utterly wacko
Pattern brushes (see Figure 9-13) are too cool for words, so I can just move 
on. Okay, no weaseling. For openers, you can use five different pieces of art 
for Pattern brushes rather than just one! Of course, that fact can also make 
them difficult to create. You need a graphic for straight lines and curves, one 
for inside corners, one for outside corners, one for the start of a line, and one 
for the end of a line. However, the results are worth the time and effort to 
make sure that these five graphics work together.
 
 
Figure 9-13: A sampling of the Pattern brushes.
 
Well, okay, if making five pieces of art is too time-intensive, you can get away 
with using just one. The Side tile is the key pattern. If you don’t create five 
different graphics, the Pattern brush just repeats the Side tile for any missing 
pattern. But come on, now, that’s cheating. If you want eye-popping results, 
make those five graphics and take full advantage of what this wonderful 
brush can do.
Making the artwork for a Pattern brush
If you find creating a Pattern brush tricky and counterintuitive, you’re not 
alone; a lot of trial and error is par for the course, especially at first. The first 
step in building a Pattern brush is to create the five pieces of artwork. Before 
you can do that, however, you need to know just what these pieces of artwork 
are for. Double-click a pattern brush in the Brushes panel to open the Pattern 
Brush Options dialog box for a peek at the possibilities. Figure 9-14 shows the 
Pattern Brush Options dialog box, in which you tell Illustrator just where to put 

177
 Chapter 9: Creating Magnificent Brushstrokes
the artwork on a path. Pattern brushes are context sensitive: They know 
what the specific part of the path they are on is supposed to look like, so they 
use the graphic that corresponds to that part of the path.

Check out existing Pattern brushes. The Tile Options list in the Pattern Brush 
Options dialog box offers a sampling.
Setting Pattern Brush options
The Pattern Brush Options dialog box looks more complicated than it really 
is. Double-click any Pattern brush in the Brushes panel, and the Pattern 
Brush Options dialog box appears, displaying the following features:
 
✓ Name: Okay, you caught me. Naming your brush isn’t really a feature. 
But you can name it if you’d like. Again, doing so may cause you to 
become emotionally attached to it. Which is why I still tear up when 
anyone mentions the name Hildegard, as that was a beautiful Pattern 
brush that I used back in the 90’s . . . .

178
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Tiles: These squares are thumbnail representations of each piece of art-
work. Beneath each tile, a graphic shows the artwork’s position on the 
path. Click a thumbnail to modify it by using the Tile Options list.
 
✓ Tile Options: Click these options to change your pattern tiles. Click 
None to remove the selected tile’s graphic. (The Original option is 
already selected if you added your own graphics.) The remaining 
options correspond to the Pattern swatches in the Swatches panel. This 
arrangement enables you to use Pattern swatches as an alternative to 
creating your own tiles.
 
✓ Colorization and Flip: See the earlier section “Art brushes for times 
when you’re a bit wacky” for details on these options.
 
✓ Scale: Use the Scale option to enlarge or shrink the tiles as they run 
along the path.
 
✓ Spacing: If your tiles get too big and start to crowd one another, use the 
Spacing option to increase the distance between tiles.
 
✓ Fit: This option determines how the tiles get distorted to fit around 
spaces that don’t quite match the five different Tile types. The Stretch 
to Fit option distorts artwork the most, mashing it into whatever shape 
it needs to be to fit the path. The Add Space to Fit option adds space 
between tiles to distort them as little as possible. The Approximate Path 
option works only when the path is rectangular.
Positioning the artwork in the Pattern brush
After you create your graphics, think 
about what position each graphic 
is going to play. You might find it 
helpful to create a single guide that 
actually contains all five positions, 
as shown in Figure 9-15. (I created 
this by just drawing a dotted line in 
Illustrator — using the Stroke dash 
feature —  and then placing different 
pattern pieces in the appropriate 
places.) Use this graphic as a way 
of visualizing how each graphic ele-
ment is going to work at the different 
points.
Using the guideline, create five pieces of artwork to correspond to the posi-
tions on the path. Knowing exactly how each piece of the artwork needs to 
change in response to its position takes practice. Some differences can be 
subtle (such as between the starting art and ending art) or obvious (such as 
between the side piece and corner pieces), as shown in Figure 9-16.
Figure 9-15: Start by creating a guideline with 
all five pattern positions.

Figure 9-16: Left to right: Start, side, outside corner, inside corner, and end pieces.
After you have all the artwork, you’re ready to create the Pattern brush. Forward, 
intrepid artist! Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the artwork you want to use as your Side tile and click the New 
Brush button (it looks like a little piece of paper) in the Brushes panel.
 
 The New Brush dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the New Pattern Brush 
option and then click OK.
 
 The Pattern Brush Options dialog 
box appears, with the Side tile 
in the proper position. (For a 
refresher on how that looks, refer 
to Figure 9-14.)
 
3. In the dialog box, give the new 
brush a name (type it in the 
Name field) and click OK.
 
 The new Pattern brush shows 
up in the Brushes panel; see 
Figure 9-17. (Don’t worry about 
the other options right now. 
I come back to those!)
Technically, the new brush is ready to use right now. (The Side artwork fills in the 
other positions.) But true artists (no slackers here!) want to add the rest of the art-
work to the brush. Naturally, this part of the process gets tricky. Notice that the 
brush, as it currently appears in Figure 9-17, has six slots, two of which are filled 
by the Side artwork. The remaining four slots are for the remaining four pieces. 
The next set of steps creates them.
Here’s how true artists (the aesthetically dedicated) add the rest of the artwork to 
the brush, one piece at a time:
 
1. Select the next piece of artwork in line and press and hold down the 
Option key Mac)/Alt (Windows).
 
2. Drag the artwork onto the Pattern brush, over the appropriate slot, and 
then release the mouse button.
Figure 9-17: The new Pattern brush, awaiting 
the four remaining pieces.

Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 You can tell that you’re over 
a slot when a bold, dark line 
appears around the slot. Ah, 
but how do you know what the 
appropriate slot is? The brush 
has no label to tell you what’s 
what. The Pattern Brush 
Options dialog box obligingly 
labels the slots, but tragi-
cally, the order of the Pattern 
bushes in that dialog box does 
not correspond to the order 
in the Brushes panel. The only 
way to add a new brush to the 
Pattern brush is to hold down 
Option/Alt and drag it (kick-
ing and screaming) onto the 
slot in the Brushes panel. But 
you’re in luck! I labeled the 
slots in the brush for you in 
Figure 9-18. So feel free to use 
the figure as a map.
 
 
Nothing stops you from putting a corner piece into the straight section 
or vice versa — nothing but your concern for your artistic reputation, 
that is. Pay careful attention to where you drop your artwork when cre-
ating a pattern brush, or you can get some nasty-looking art as a result!
 
3. The Pattern Brush Options dialog box appears, displaying the artwork 
in its appropriate place. Click OK.
 
 Don’t worry about the other options for now.
 
4. Drag all the remaining graphics to their appointed places.
 
 Each time you add a graphic, the Pattern Brush Options dialog box 
appears again. Just click OK and keep going.
Testing your new Pattern brush
When you finally have all your graphics in place, you can test the new brush by 
applying it to open and closed paths: After making sure that the new brush is 
selected in the Brushes panel, create two simple graphics. Anything you create 
when a brush is selected uses that brush as its stroke, even when you aren’t 
using the Paintbrush tool. Any path will work, but because the Pattern brush

 Chapter 9: Creating Magnificent Brushstrokes
uses different artwork at corners, 
testing the shape on an object that 
has corners (such as a rectangle) 
is helpful. In this example, I use the 
Rectangle tool to create a square. 
With the new brush still selected, 
I choose the Pen tool and create a 
basic shape. This procedure shows 
how the corner and side tiles look on 
straight lines. Testing this way (as I 
did in Figure 9-19) gives you a good 
idea of whether all your artwork is 
working well in the new brush.
 
If any of your tiles aren’t working, 
tweak the original artwork, select it, 
and drag it back to the appropriate 
slot.
Calligraphic brushes for formal occasions
Calligraphic brushes create strokes 
that emulate the kinds of strokes 
you make with real calligraphic 
pens; the strokes they make vary in 
width depending on the direction 
of the stroke. As the only brushes 
that aren’t created by paths that 
you can drag into the Brushes panel, 
Calligraphic brushes are the noncon-
formist brushes in Illustrator. You 
set them up by using controls in the 
Calligraphic Brush Options dialog 
box (accessed by either creating a 
new brush or by double-clicking on an existing Calligraphic brush), as shown 
in Figure 9-20.
Although calligraphic brushes are deceptively simple, don’t let the name 
fool you. You can use them to create any type of artwork — not just 
calligraphy — and they’re especially good for emulating traditional pen 
and ink–type drawings.
 
Yep, the Calligraphic Brush tool seems a lot more like a real pen than the 
powerful-but-weird Pen tool. It may help to think of it this way: Calligraphy is 
an art practiced with brushes.
Figure 9-19: The new Pattern brush shown on a 
path.
Figure 9-20: The Calligraphic Brush Options 
dialog box.

182
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
To create a Calligraphic brush, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Brush icon (it looks like a tiny piece of paper) in the 
Brushes panel.
 
 The New Brush dialog box appears.
 
2. In the New Brush dialog box, select the New Calligraphic Brush option 
and then click OK.
 
 The Calligraphic Brush Options dialog box appears; refer to Figure 9-20. 
Although it might look intimidating, you have only the following three 
options to set (after you name the brush):
 
• Angle: If you were using a real-world brush (or pen, as the case 
may be), this setting would be the angle at which you’d be tilting 
the brush.
 
• Roundness: This setting enables you to change just how round the 
brush is — from a narrow ellipse to a circle.
 
• Diameter: This setting determines how large the brush is.
 
 The boxes in the middle column determine how (and by how much) 
those first three options may vary, if at all. Select one of three options 
in these drop-down list boxes to determine whether the preceding three 
options may vary not at all (Fixed), randomly (Random), or according to 
the amount of pressure you apply by using a pressure-sensitive stylus 
(Pressure).
 
 
The boxes in the third column enable you to set the amount by which 
those first three options may vary (if the method by which they may 
vary is either Random or Pressure). The higher the numbers, the greater 
the range of sizes the brush will produce. Figure 9-21 shows the same 
pattern using different calligraphic brushes. 
 
3. After you set your options, click OK.
 
 The new Calligraphic brush appears in the Brushes panel for you to use.
As you begin creating artwork with brushes, you discover that it’s just like 
painting with real paintbrushes — the best artwork requires a combination 
of several different brushes. Fortunately, you have an astonishing variety of 
brushes to choose from! The most well-stocked art supply store pales in com-
parison to the Brushes panel. Best of all, you don’t have to pay extra when-
ever you need a new brush. You can just build your own!

T
o say that in Illustrator, you can create just about anything you can imag-
ine isn’t an overstatement. The trick is to know which buttons to push 
to make your artistic vision become an Illustrator document. This chapter 
pushes fills and strokes to their limits, showing you how you too can create 
cool stuff. You know — the stuff that  makes you scratch your head and say, 
“How did they do that?” And then you wonder whether you’ll ever be able to 
create anything as artistic.
Well, it isn’t so hard. You just need to use some of the more 
arcane Illustrator tools (the Mesh tool, for example) and 
a few cantankerous menu commands that don’t want 
to do anything unless you apply them just right. This 
chapter shows you how to use them to get good 
results with the tools and commands that take 
center stage. Like temperamental sports cars, 
they’re a little tricky to use — but worth the effort!
Messing Around with Meshes
Illustrator is really great at filling areas with solid 
colors, continuous patterns, or gradients. Illustrator 
gets testy, though, when you try to create a continuous 
tone — such as the many skin tones that define a human 
face, or how colors fade into one another in a piece of folded 
fabric. However, you can use the Illustrator Mesh tool, even if it is a bit of 
a crotchety magician. Just talk nicely to it, and it can help you bend the rules 
a bit. With the Mesh tool, you can create amazing shading and tonal effects.

186
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
And gradient meshes overcome the limitations of gradients (the other 
Illustrator feature that enables you to blend colors; for more, see Chapter 5). 
Simple gradients fill areas with linear and radial color blends. Period. 
Comparatively, gradient Meshes have no such limitation. You can use them to 
assign colors to the specific points and paths that make up an object. Where 
the mesh lines cross, you can assign a different color to every line and every 
point. These colors blend with the colors of the other points. Take a look at 
Figure 10-1 for a sample of what you can do with a gradient mesh.
 
 
 Figure 10-1: The artwork that made up the Illustrator Venus was colored 
entirely with the Mesh tool.
Figure 10-1 might seem complex, but 
the difficulty lies much more in the 
artistry than in the technical aspects. 
The Mesh tool might seem daunt-
ing at first, but you can tackle it if 
you begin by adding a highlight to 
a simple shape, as shown in Figure 
10-2. Do that, and you’re well on your 
way to gradient mesh mastery, as 
spelled out in the next section.
Figure 10-2: Use the Mesh tool to create a 
highlight in a path.

187
 Chapter 10: Extreme Fills and Strokes
Adding a gradient mesh manually
To add a gradient mesh to a simple shape, just follow these steps:
 
1. Create a shape by clicking and dragging with any of the basic object 
tools (see Chapter 4 for more on basic objects) and fill the shape with 
a dark color.
 
 You can use any shape. For this example, I created a circle and colored 
it black.
 
2. Deselect the path (choose Select➪Deselect).
 
 Deselecting the path enables you to pick a different color for the Mesh 
tool. If you choose a different color with the path selected, you change 
the color of the object.
 
3. Set the fill color to any light color.
 
 Choose Window➪Color to open the Color panel. Click the Fill box and 
choose a light color to use as a highlight. (Gradient meshes use only fill 
colors and ignore stroke colors.)
 
 
4. Choose the Mesh tool from the Tools panel and click the object to 
which you want to add a highlight.
 
 
 As if by magic, two intersecting paths appear on the object, crossing at 
the spot where you clicked. (You can see this intersection back in Figure 
10-2 where all the blue lines are converging in the red middle of the 
star.) This intersection is the mesh point. These paths are the gradient 
mesh. The highlight appears where the paths intersect.
 
5. Click other areas within the path to add more highlights — as many as 
you want.
The paths that make up the gradient mesh can be edited the same as any 
other path. Click the mesh points in the path with the Direct Selection tool 
and move them to create different effects. Mesh points also have direction 
points, just like curved paths. (See Chapter 6 for more on paths.) These direc-
tion points can be moved to change the shape of the gradient mesh. You can 
also change the color of any point or path segment by clicking it and choos-
ing a different color in the Color or Swatches panels. Figure 10-3 shows differ-
ent effects made by mashing the gradient mesh around.
That’s really all there is to this tool! I moved those points by using the Direct 
Selection tool and then tweaked the colors by selecting a point or a path and 
choosing a new color in the Color or Swatches panels (accessible by choos-
ing Window➪Color and Window➪Swatches, respectively).

188
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
Figure 10-3: Same gradient mesh with mesh points moved.
Letting gradient mesh do the work for you
You can automate the process by clicking the object you want and choos-
ing Object➪Create Gradient Mesh. This method adds a gradient mesh to the 
object automatically. Illustrator does its best to estimate where the mesh 
paths should go by looking at the shape of the object and figuring out where 
the mesh paths should go to shade the object 
so that it looks three dimensional. You can even 
have the gradient mesh create the shading for 
you.
After you select the Create Gradient Mesh com-
mand, the Create Gradient Mesh dialog box opens 
(shown in Figure 10-4). Set your options, click OK, 
and the command does the mesh-y work for you. 
Here’s the all-star lineup of options:
 
✓ Rows and Columns: These options set the number of mesh paths that 
the command creates. The higher the number, the more control you 
have over the colors in your object (but the more complicated the 
graphic is to work with).
Figure 10-4: Set your Gradient 
Mesh here.

189
 Chapter 10: Extreme Fills and Strokes
 
✓ Appearance: Select one of three Appearance options. Figure 10-5 shows 
the differences between the three options.
 
• To Center: Lightens colors to place a highlight in the center of the 
object, creating the appearance that the graphic is being pulled 
outward
 
• To Edge: Places a highlight at the edges of the object, creating the 
appearance that the graphic is being pulled inward
 
• Flat: Doesn’t change any colors but still creates the mesh, so you 
can change colors on your own

Figure 10-5: The same gradient mesh: Flat, To Center, and To Edge.
 
✓ Highlight: When you select an Appearance option of To Edge or To 
Center, the Highlight setting determines the maximum amount that the 
colors lighten to create the 3-D effect.
In Figure 10-5, the two examples on the right show objects with a highlight 
applied to them using the Illustrator automatic highlighting process.
Creating soft bevels with Gradient Mesh
You can use the Mesh tool to create a soft-beveled object. The following  
steps illustrate a very basic, yet quite handy, method for creating bevels:
 
 
1. Create a square by choosing the Rectangle tool and then clicking the 
Artboard and dragging. Fill the square with a nice strong solid color, 
such as grass green or fire engine red.
 
 Other shapes work with this, but a square is the simplest.
 
 
2. Choose the Mesh tool, click just inside the upper-left corner, and then 
click again just inside the lower-right corner.

190
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 This creates a total of nine mesh 
patches on the square, as shown 
in Figure 10-6.
 
 
3. Using the Direct Selection tool, 
drag a marquee around the four 
points along the top edge of the 
square. Then press Shift and 
drag a marquee around the 
unselected three points on the 
left edge of the square.
 
 You have seven points selected 
now, around the top-left corner, all 
on the outside edge of the square.
 
4. Choose Window➪Color.
 
 The Color panel appears, as 
shown in Figure 10-7.
 
5. Holding down the Shift key, 
drag one of the right-most 
triangles to the left about half-
way. (In the example using 
the red color from Figure 10-7, 
you could choose either the 
Magenta or Yellow triangle.)
 
 The Shift key “tints” whatever 
color you selected in Step 1 
when you drag a slider in the 
Color panel.
 
6. Again using the Direct 
Selection tool, drag a marquee 
around the three rightmost 
points along the bottom edge 
of the square. Then press Shift 
and drag a marquee around 
the middle two points on the 
right edge of the square.
 
 With the lower-right points 
selected, you’re now ready to 
darken this corner of the square.
 
7. Drag the K slider on the Color 
panel to the right until you 
darken the lower-right edge to 
your liking.
 
 The result looks something like 
Figure 10-8.

the Mesh tool.

 Chapter 10: Extreme Fills and Strokes
Making Objects Partially Transparent 
and Blending Colors
By default, Illustrator creates objects that hide whatever is behind them. 
However, the Transparency panel enables you to change this situation. 
With the Opacity option, you can fade objects so that the underlying objects 
show through them. You can also blend the colors in the top graphics with 
the underlying graphics (in an astonishing variety of ways) by using blend 
modes.
One of the powerful features of the Transparency panel is that everything 
you do in it is live, meaning that your paths suffer no permanent changes 
after you make them transparent. You can change opacity again and again — 
or remove it altogether if you want — without changing your path data. This 
capability gives you tremendous room to play and experiment with different 
opacities.
Fade away with opacity
In Figure 10-9, a red “no” symbol is faded-out to 50% opacity to partly reveal 
details behind it. 
 
 
Figure 10-9: Original opacity (left) and faded to 50% (right).
To make something partially transparent, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object (or objects) that you want to fade.
 
 
When you select multiple objects, they all get the same opacity setting.

192
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
2. Choose Window➪Transparency.
 
 The Transparency panel appears, as shown 
in Figure 10-10.
 
3. In the Transparency panel, drag the Opacity 
slider until it shows the percentage of opac-
ity you want to give to the selected object(s).
 
 After you release the mouse button, the selected objects become par-
tially transparent.
 
By default, transparency applies evenly to both the fill and stroke. To assign 
the fill and the stroke independent Opacity values, use the Appearance panel. 
See Chapter 11 for details.
Big fun with math! Blending 
graphics with blend modes
Pssst! Listen very, very carefully while I tell you what’s really going on with 
blend modes. Here’s the scoop: Forget the math and pay attention to what 
the resulting artwork looks like.
 
Illustrator defines every color mathematically. You see that math when you 
drag sliders in the Color panel. A bright red color may be defined as R:216, 
G:20, and B:7 (in RGB) or C:20%, M:95%, Y:95%, and K:5% (in CMYK). Each of 
these numbers reflects a different amount of a component color; every differ-
ent color has its own color value.
Blend modes take the colors in an object and 
mix them with the colors in underlying objects, 
performing a mathematical calculation using 
numbers that identify the colors of the objects. 
Therefore, if the top object is red, the underlying 
object is blue, and you have the blend mode set to 
Multiply, red’s number gets multiplied by blue’s 
number. The resulting color is what you see. 
Other modes do more complex calculations. What 
does that mean? What’s blue times red? What’s 
the difference between yellow and mauve? 
What’s the sound of one hand clapping?
In short, it doesn’t matter. What the result looks 
like is what matters! Try this approach for your-
self: Select the top object and choose a differ-
ent blend mode. Blend modes hang out in the 
Transparency panel Blend Mode menu, as shown 
in Figure 10-11.

panel.

Mode pop-up menu in the

 Chapter 10: Extreme Fills and Strokes
Figure 10-12 shows three (of the 16 possible) blend modes at work on the 
same image — and they’re completely changeable. If you try one and don’t 
like it, just choose another from the menu.
 
 
Figure 10-12: Three blend modes in Illustrator.
Discovering How Strokes Work
Any path in Illustrator can pick up a stroke (. . . stroke . . . stroke! Sorry. Just 
daydreaming about going for a nice row on a lake). In Illustrator, a stroke is a 
line placed on a path. A stroke can be of any thickness, which Illustrator calls 
its weight. Strokes can be any color or pattern.
In Chapter 9, I discuss the specialized strokes that you can make with the 
Paintbrush tool. The Pen and Pencil tools also provide distinctive strokes of 
their own (Chapters 7 and 8, respectively).
In addition to color and weight, you can give strokes special attributes. These 
attributes include the specific look of corners (joins) and endings (caps) as 
well as whether the stroke has a pattern of dashes applied to it. To investi-
gate all the advanced ways you can modify strokes, look at the Stroke panel 
shown in Figure 10-13. (Choose Window➪Stroke and choose Show Options 

194
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
from the Stroke panel pop-up 
menu.) To change how a stroke 
appears, select a path and play 
around in the Stroke panel to see 
what happens. I won’t tell a soul.
Strokes are applied to the center 
of a path by default, which means 
that the strokes, especially those 
of larger weight, can ooze beyond 
the path. The path runs along the 
exact middle of the stroke. For 
more information on the relation-
ship between strokes and paths, 
see Chapter 5.
Caps, joins, and dashes
A stroke can be (and often is) a 
continuous line of color that fol-
lows a path, even if the path is as 
convoluted as a strand of cooked 
spaghetti. But paths can also appear chopped up into dashes. You can tweak 
the shape of the dashes all at once, without having to fuss over every single 
one. You can set the shape that an individual dash (the basic unit of an open 
path) begins or ends with (its cap) and the shape of its corner points (its 
join).
Strokes can have any of three different caps and any of three different joins 
applied to them. Combine these with the almost-limitless combinations pos-
sible for dash patterns and weights, and you can see the incredible versatility 
of strokes. To access these additional options, choose Window➪Stroke. In 
the Stroke panel that appears, select Show Options from the panel pop-up 
menu; refer to Figure 10-13.
Caps
Shaping the ends of the dashes that 
make up an open path can change 
the entire look of the path. For 
example, imagine a dashed line that’s 
500 dashes long. Then imagine that 
all 500 dashes have identical ends, 
shaped like one of the three shapes 
in Figure 10-14.

Figure 10-13: The Stroke panel displaying a full set

Figure 10-14: Three different caps on three 
paths.

195
 Chapter 10: Extreme Fills and Strokes
Depending on which Cap setting you choose, you get three noticeably differ-
ent capped lines. Here are the options:
 
✓ Butt Cap: Chops off the stroke at the ends.
 
✓ Round Cap: Extends the stroke past the ends (or around the dash loca-
tion) with semicircular ends. (The radius of each semicircle equals half 
the stroke weight.)
 
✓ Projecting Cap: Extends the stroke past the ends (or around the dash 
location) with squared ends. (The amount of each extension equals half 
the stroke weight.)
To change how a line is capped, select it with any selection tool, and then 
click the desired cap in the Stroke panel.
Joins
The Stroke panel offers three differ-
ent joins. Figure 10-15 shows how 
they appear on paths. Joins affect 
only corner points, not smooth 
points. (See Chapter 6 for more info 
on corner points.) They make cor-
ners appear sharp and pointy, blunt 
and rounded, or squared off.
Depending on which Join setting you 
choose, you get three noticeably dif-
ferent corners. Here are the options:
 
✓ Miter Join: Causes the outside corner of the stroke to come to a sharp 
point
 
✓ Round Join: Causes the outside corner of a stroke to come to a rounded 
or smooth curve
 
✓ Bevel Join: Cuts off the corner so that the width of the stroke is the 
same at the bevel as on the rest of the stroke
If these terms look familiar, you’re probably familiar with woodworking — or 
you actually paid attention in industrial arts class.
Dashes
Dashes break up the stroke into repeating segments of any length, with 
gaps between them, also of any length. You can set up to three different 
dash sizes — and three different gap sizes — in any stroke, as shown in 
Figure 10-16.
Figure 10-15: Three different joins on a path 
(left to right): Miter, Round, and Bevel.

196
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
Figure 10-16: Three different dash patterns and the settings used to create them.
Dashes work with the Cap settings. (What the heck, call it a labor-saving 
device.) Whichever Cap setting you use applies to the ends of all the dashes, 
not just to the ends of the path.
To create a dashed line, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Dashed Line option in the Stroke panel.
 
2. Set a dash size in the first dash box.
 
 Remember that the Round and Projecting Cap settings extend the dash 
from its center by half the width of the stroke. Therefore, if you use the 
Projecting Cap setting and your dash setting is 10 points (pt), on a line 
with a 20 pt stroke, the dash will be 30 pt long.
 
 Choose a Butt Cap setting when you want your dashes to be an exact 
length that doesn’t vary with the width of the stroke. If you want an 
exact circle for a dash (or a dot), use a 0 pt dash. That creates a dot the 
width of the stroke.
 
3. Set the gap size in the first gap box (the distance between the ends of 
the dashes).

197
 Chapter 10: Extreme Fills and Strokes
 
 
This setting can be a little confusing if you’re using the Round or 
Projecting Cap settings because these extend the length of the dash past 
the end of the dash and into the gap, based on the width of the stroke, 
creating a gap that looks smaller than what you specified. The width of 
the stroke also affects the gap size. If you want a gap of 20 pt and you’re 
using a 10 pt stroke, set the gap size to 30 pt.
Clipping Masks
No, clipping masks aren’t special headgear that the barber wears to entertain 
young customers. Clipping masks are simple, yet incredibly handy, Illustrator 
features. Simply put, they hide things. Like Effects and Transparency settings, 
Clipping Masks are live functions that make no permanent change to path 
data. They make things look different, but you can take them away with a 
single command, and your paths remain exactly as they were before.
Clipping masks use objects to hide other objects, as shown in Figure 10-17. 
The top object (the masking object) becomes completely transparent. The 
underlying objects become invisible except for where the mask object is. The 
number of objects beneath the mask doesn’t matter. Only the topmost object 
functions as the masking object. The top object’s fill and stroke also don’t 
matter, because the top object becomes invisible.
 
Clipping masks let you “fill” an object with any other object(s), making them 
the most extreme fill you’ll find in Illustrator.
 
 
 Figure 10-17: Original (left), the masking object in front of the artwork (middle), and the masked 
artwork (right).

198
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
To create a clipping mask, here’s the drill:
 
1. Create an object to be used as a mask.
 
 Masks can be any shape or color. You can even use text as a mask.
 
2. Position the object in front of whatever you want to mask out.
 
3. Select the object and all the objects behind it that you want to mask out.
 
 Shift-click with the Selection tool to select multiple objects.
 
4. Choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.
 
 The masking object and anything outside the mask disappear, leaving 
just what’s inside and behind the masking object.
 
The things that seem to disappear after you apply the mask aren’t really gone. 
They’re just hidden. You can bring them back by choosing Object➪Clipping 
Mask➪Release. Sometimes that’s more impressive than pulling a rabbit out of 
your hat.

B
ack in the twentieth century, Illustrator was a straightforward program 
that offered relatively few (and relatively obvious) choices. You knew 
when you looked at a pink rectangle that it was made with four corner points 
joined by four paths and was filled with a single, solid pink color. But 
those days of blissful innocence are past. Now that pink rect-
angle might really be a red rectangle that some fiend faded 
to 50% Opacity via the Transparency panel. And that 
rectangle might not be a rectangle at all, but a graphic 
of an old shoe that has been disguised as a rectangle 
using the Effect➪Convert to Shape➪Rectangle com-
mand. In this world of illusions, where anything 
can appear to be anything else and nothing is as it 
seems, what’s an artist to do?
The truth is, the ability of Illustrator to make 
objects look different without changing the original 
object is amazing. Illustrator lets you do incredibly 
powerful stuff that would be impossible otherwise, 
and more importantly, gives you incredible editability. 
Editability, you ask? That’s one of the primary reasons to 

200
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
use Illustrator in the first place. The ability to go back at any time to change a 
small aspect of your artwork without having to redo all the work you initially 
put in is incredibly valuable.
Effects (and transparency) let you change the appearance of your artwork 
easily (again, without changing the underlying object). Illustrator has dozens 
of them, giving you power and flexibility beyond anything you can dream of.
In this chapter, you also discover a wonderful tool for cutting through (and 
taking control of) the illusions of Illustrator: the Appearance panel. The 
Appearance panel enables you to see exactly what secrets your artwork is 
hiding. If that were all it did, it’d be worth its weight in gold. But it does so 
much more! Beyond just seeing what’s been done to an illustration, you also 
find out how to change the attributes of the illustration. For example, you can 
alter applied effects — or delete them altogether.
You also discover how to use the Appearance panel to target only the fill of 
an object (or just the stroke) when you apply Transparency or Effects set-
tings. You also use the Appearance panel to perform casual miracles, such as 
assigning multiple fills and strokes to a single object.
To make matters even better, this chapter shows you how to save all the 
Appearance settings as a style. Styles are saved in the Graphic Styles panel. 
You can apply a style to any object. In addition to being a quick way to 
apply all these attributes to objects, styles can be updated in a way that also 
updates all objects with those styles applied.
The Effect Menu
The Effect menu (shown in Figure 11-1) contains more amazing things than 
you see on a government-sponsored tour of Area 51 (okay, bad analogy . . . but 
there’s a lot of stuff there, really). Everything that you apply remains live — 
that is, changeable until you tell it to stop changing. Effects change the way 
an object looks but not the object itself. Applying effects is like telling the 
object to put on a specific costume, or changing the appearance of the world 
when you look through rose-colored glasses. No permanent change to the 
underlying object takes place.

201
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
 
Instead of rewriting the code for 
an object (which is what you tell 
Illustrator to do when you move a 
point), effects tack on extra code, 
leaving the original code untouched. 
You can change or remove the extra 
code, without affecting the original. 
It’s sort of like when you put on a 
nice outfit — you’re still the same 
person underneath, but you have 
snazzy duds on that make you look 
different.
Ah, yes, all things must change — 
and sometimes you get to change 
them. Contemplate the concept of 
infinite editability for a moment. 
An object in Illustrator is saying, 
“Turn me into anything.” Illustrator 
provides the capability of changing 
appearance without manipulating 
points. You can simply get rid of 
them at any time, without putting 
a scratch on your original artwork, 
without having to redo it, without 
having to resort to Edit➪Undo, and 
without having to growl at the dog. 
Now that’s progress.
Applying live effects 
to objects
Figure 11-2 shows the difference 
between manually changing an 
object as opposed to a live effect. A 
path (left) is manually “roughened” 
by adding points and moving them, 
and the same path (right) roughened with the Roughen effect. The big-
gest difference is that the path on the manually changed object shows the 
additional points you had to put on the path, and where you moved them. 
The Roughen effect, found under the Effects menu, leaves the original path 
untouched, but still looks roughened.
Figure 11-1: The Effect menu, fully of, erm, 
Effectiveness.

202
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
 Figure 11-2: A path (left) manually “roughened,” and the same path (right) 
with the Roughen effect.
To apply an effect to a path, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a path using a selection tool of your choice.
 
2. Choose an effect from the Effect menu.
 
 For example, you can choose Effect➪Distort & Transform➪Pucker & 
Bloat. A dialog box opens for that effect, and you can enter the specific 
settings.
 
 
You can always go back and change the settings if you don’t like the 
result. (If only I could do that in real life.)
 
3. Click OK to apply the effect to the path.
 
Some effects (many of these are in the second section of effects that starts 
with the Artistic effect) only work when the document is in RGB Document 
Color mode. (See Chapter 1 for more on the various modes.) If an effect is 
grayed out (unavailable) after you select an object, your document is prob-
ably in CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) mode. You can, however, 
work on artwork initially in RGB Document Color mode and change it to 
CMYK later.

3D Effects
Illustrator is technically a 2D product. Everything it creates exists (at least in 
final form) in 2D space. But hidden away amongst all the cool effects in the 
Effects menu is the 3D effect, which allows you to quickly extrude, revolve, 
and rotate items in 3D space. Figure 11-3 shows the 3D Extrude and Bevel 
dialog box, where you can see all sorts of fun 3D options (and there’s all sorts 
of other ones that are hidden)!
Going into all the options for 3D is beyond the depth <cough> of this book, 
but simply stated, select any path with a solid color fill, choose Effects➪
3D➪3D Extrude & Bevel and just start noodling around with the settings 
(make sure the Preview checkbox is checked) and you’ll see the wonder 
that is 3D. Figure 11-4 shows a simple path in its original drawn form next to 
the same path that has been extruded, another that has been revolved, and 
another that has been rotated in 3D space.

to you in 2D.

path and rotated path.
Removing and changing effects
To change or remove effects, use the 
Appearance panel, as shown in Fig-
ure 11-5. The Appearance panel is 
such an amazing panel that the major-
ity of this chapter is devoted to it. For 
now, though, I just want to show you 
how to use the Appearance panel to 
remove and change effects.
Appearances aside (so to speak), 
removing an effect is as simple as 
following these steps:
 
1. Select the object that has the 
effect that you want to remove. 
(Unless the object is grouped, 
you can use the regular (black) 
Selection tool for selecting the 
object.)
 
2. If the Appearance panel isn’t visible (it is by default), choose 
Window➪Appearance.
 
 In the Appearance panel, the selected object is listed as Object or Path. 
Beneath the object is a list that includes the stroke and fill of the object 
and all the effects applied to it.
 
3. In the list, click the effect that you want to discard.
 
4. Click the trashcan at the lower right of the Appearance panel.
 
 The effect disappears, and the object returns to its former appearance 
(before you applied the effect).
 
To change an effect, follow the preceding steps. However, instead of clicking 
the trashcan, double-click the effect in the Appearance panel. The particu-
lar effect’s dialog box opens, where you can enter new settings. Click OK to 
apply the effect with the new settings.
Figure 11-5: The roughened path from 
Figure 11-2 in the Appearance panel.

205
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
 
Do not go back to the Effect menu to change the settings of an effect that has 
been applied to an object, even if adding the effect is the last thing you did. 
Instead of changing the settings on the existing effect, you actually apply 
another effect to the object on top of the existing one. While applying mul-
tiple effects to objects is often desired, it isn’t if you’re trying to edit the exist-
ing effect. So, as my Tip above states, just go back and start all over again.
Rasterization effects
Not all effects can be generated from 
path-based artwork. That’s where 
the Rasterization effects come in. 
(Rasterization = the process of turn-
ing things into pixels or adding pixel-
based imagery to your artwork.) 
These effects either change the 
original artwork into pixels or add 
new pixel-based images to achieve 
the desired effect. The effects in the 
second section of the Effect menu 
(from the Artistic effect down), as well 
as Drop Shadow, Feather, Inner Glow, 
Outer Glow, and Rasterize use pixels 
to achieve the change in appearance.
You control various attributes of 
these rasterization-based effects by 
choosing Effect➪Document Raster 
Effects Settings. The Document 
Raster Effects Settings dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 11-6.
In the Document Raster Effects Settings dialog box, you can set the following 
options:
 
✓ Color Model: This setting determines the color model used by the 
resulting graphic. Try to use the color model of your target output as 
much as possible. If you’re creating a graphic print in grayscale, choose 
Grayscale. If you’re bound for the Web, choose RGB. Choosing Bitmap 
turns your art into harsh black and white tones, if you’re into that sort 
of thing. But most people aren’t, and you should stay away from that set-
ting. Refer to Chapter 1 for more about CMYK vs. RGB.
 
✓ Resolution: This setting determines how much information the resulting 
image contains. Try to match this setting with the graphic’s purpose. For 
the Web, select 72 ppi (pixels per inch). For most ink jet printers, 150 ppi is 
sufficient. For high-resolution printing, 300 ppi is a good, all-purpose size.
Figure 11-6: The Document Raster Effects 
Settings dialog box takes a bow.

206
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ Background: Pixel-based images are always rectangular. If the graphic 
you’re rasterizing is anything but rectangular, you have to add a back-
ground to make the graphic rectangular. The background can be white 
or transparent. White is fine for a stand-alone graphic, but if that graphic 
is in front of other objects, the white background obscures them. When 
that’s the case, choose the Transparent setting.
 
✓ Options: The Anti-Alias option adds a slight blurring wherever different 
colors meet. Believe it or not, this setting usually makes the resulting 
graphic look better. Results vary from graphic to graphic, of course, 
so try rasterizing with and without the Anti-Alias option selected. The 
Create Clipping Mask option matters only if you select white for the 
Background setting; see the preceding bullet. In Illustrator, a clipping 
mask is a special graphic that hides parts of other graphics. When you 
select the Create Clipping Mask option, a clipping mask is added to hide 
the white parts added to make the graphic rectangular.
 
✓ Add: Typing a numeric value in this option box adds extra pixels around 
the graphic, just in case you need them. Hey, you never know! Nobody 
wants to run short of pixels, and this option actually helps prevent 
objects, such as drop shadows and other offset pixels, from getting 
clipped on the edges.
 
✓ Preserve Spot Colors: Checking this box will allow you to use spot 
colors in your document if it contains transparency. If you’re using a 
spot color, keep this checked.
After you choose your settings, click OK. Any existing (or future) effects that 
use pixels will use these settings.
The Appearance Panel
The Appearance panel, shown in 
Figure 11-7, is where you go to see 
why your artwork looks the way 
it does. (However, the panel can’t 
explain why anybody would put 
neon-pink paisleys all over the place.) 
You can view the Appearance panel 
by choosing Window➪Appearance. 
When the Appearance panel wafts 
into view, it bears a vast treasure of 
option information. In its basic state, 
the panel displays Fill, Stroke, and 
Opacity settings. In its more complex 
state, the panel displays additional fills and strokes, and effects applied to 
those fills and strokes (as well as to the object itself).
Figure 11-7: The Appearance panel.

207
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
Not to worry: This wealth of information isn’t nearly as confusing as your 
income tax form. Here’s why: All along, in the course of creating your artwork, 
you’ve been putting all these informational tidbits into the Appearance panel. 
You tell Illustrator to add info to this panel every time you set an option that 
changes the way your object looks (such as stroke, fill, and transparency).
 
The Appearance panel faithfully records all this information all the time, even 
if you don’t look at it. (Good thing it doesn’t record everything appearance 
related, like that incredibly fashionable bathrobe you’re wearing as you read 
this.)
Reading the Appearance panel
The (much larger) Appearance panel 
shown in Figure 11-8 displays accu-
mulated information about a particu-
lar object. What does it all mean? Is 
it important? Why oh why did Natalie 
ever leave the Maniacs? I’ll answer 
the first questions, and leave the last 
one for a Behind the Music special.
To make sense of all the Appearance 
panel’s information, peruse the fol-
lowing list of its features:
 
✓ Target: This feature identifies 
the type of graphic that the 
information in the Appearance 
panel refers to. Typically this 
feature reads Object or Path, 
meaning the information in 
the panel refers to (or will be 
applied to) an appearance that 
is or will be applied to a single 
selected object. When you select 
a group or a layer, the target 
reads Group or Layer. If text is selected, the target reads Type. The 
target section is always at the top. A tiny thumbnail image emulates the 
appearance of the graphic.
 
✓ Global effects: These effects apply equally to, and affect all aspects of, 
the entire object. Whenever you apply Effects or Transparency settings 
(as I described earlier in this chapter) without using the Appearance 
panel, you apply the effects as global effects. Although they’re usually 
the first attribute you apply, they always appear near the bottom of the 
list in the Appearance panel.
Figure 11-8: The Appearance panel displays 
info about the object, such as stroke and fill 
data.

208
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 Another way to differentiate global effects from other effects is how 
they line up with other items listed in the panel. Global effects appear in 
alignment with the Stroke and the Fill listings. Effects applied to a spe-
cific stroke are indented beneath the listing for that specific stroke. In 
Figure 11-8, Roughen is the global effect.
 
✓ Strokes: Objects can have more than one stroke only when you add 
them through the Appearance panel. (See the section, “Adding fills and 
strokes,” later in this chapter.) Therefore, the first one (listed at the top) 
is typically the one also shown in the Tools panel. The target may have 
additional strokes listed here as well. Strokes can have effects applied to 
them specifically. In Figure 11-8, you see a single stroke with a weight of 
6 points. See Chapter 5 for more information on strokes.
 
✓ Stroke and Fill effects: Effects can be applied directly to strokes and 
fills, instead of to the entire object, group, or layer. In this figure, a drop 
shadow has been applied directly to the fill.
 
✓ Stroke and Fill Opacity: Each stroke and fill can have various Transparency 
settings applied to it. Here, the fill has an Opacity setting of 61%.
 
✓ Fill: Each object (group or layer) can have multiple fills (like it can have 
multiple strokes). Each fill can also have any number of effects applied to it.
 
✓ Eyeballs: Every single line in the Appearance panel has an eyeball next to 
it. Super creepy, I know. But each of those eyeballs can be used to hide 
any one line of info for the selected object, or the object itself. Say you’re 
working with an object that has three strokes, and you want to see the 
color of the middle stroke, but it’s hard to see ’cause the top stroke is 
covering it. No problem! Just click the eyeball next to the top stroke, and 
it won’t be visible while you’re working on that middle stroke.
 
✓ Opacity: This feature is the transparency appearance for the entire object, 
group, or layer. In Figure 11-8, the Opacity is set to 61%, meaning the entire 
object has been faded to 61%. If no special Transparency settings were 
applied, this would simply read Opacity: Default. See Chapter 10 for more 
information on the Transparency panel.
The top-to-bottom order of the fills and strokes in the Appearance panel reflect 
a front-to-back order in the graphic. Strokes and fills on top in the panel appear 
in front of the strokes and fills that are lower in the panel. Effects run from top 
to bottom in terms of which effect is applied to the graphic first.
Most of the items in the Appearance panel can be moved up and down through 
the list into different positions, and this change is reflected in the actual 
graphic. For instance, you can move the Feather effect applied to a stroke so 
that it’s applied to a fill. You can also move the Feather effect so that it applies 
to the entire object. To move something in the Appearance panel, drag it up 
and down through the panel, just as you move things in the Layers panel.

209
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
 
If a fill or stroke has an effect applied to it, the little disclosure triangle auto-
matically appears on the left and points down, listing the attributes of that 
fill or stroke. When you have a whole lot of different effects applied to a fill or 
stroke, the panel can get cumbersome. Clicking the disclosure triangle hides 
the list of effects. You can access the list at any time by clicking the disclo-
sure triangle again.
Adding fills and strokes
Chapter 5 explores fills and strokes in greater detail (and if you want to 
nip back there for more information, I can wait). When you apply a differ-
ent stroke or fill to an object without using the Appearance panel, the fill or 
stroke replaces any existing fill or stroke. You don’t have to settle for just one 
of each, though! From the Appearance panel, you can add as many fills and 
strokes as you want, as shown in Figure 11-9. This feature offers some inter-
esting possibilities. For example, you can give a path three different colored 
strokes of different sizes, to create a striped path. Or you can apply a pattern 
fill over a solid-color fill. The Appearance panel is shown next to this figure 
so you can see exactly how it is constructed.
 
 
Figure 11-9: Multiple fills and strokes on an object.

210
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
Just follow these steps to apply an additional fill and stroke to an object:
 
1. Create an object with a fill color and a thick stroke.
 
 In this example, I drew a simplistic rubber ducky shape using the Pen 
tool. (See Chapter 7 for more information on the Pen tool.) I filled it 
with a solid color by clicking the Fill box in the Tools panel, and then by 
adjusting the sliders in the Colors panel. I next added a 24-point black 
stroke to the ducky by clicking the Stroke box in the Tools panel, and 
then by clicking a black swatch in the Swatches panel, and finally by 
choosing 24 points from the Stroke panel. (For more info on fills and 
strokes, see Chapter 5.)
 
2. Choose the Add New Fill command from the Appearance panel 
pop-up menu or by clicking the white box at the bottom left of the 
Appearance panel.
 
 
Illustrator adds a fill, but you don’t see any difference because the new 
fill is identical to the fill already there. The new fill is highlighted in the 
Appearance panel, however, and as soon as you select a new fill from the 
Color panel or the Swatches panel, you see the new fill over the old one.
 
3. With the new fill still highlighted in the Appearance panel, change the 
fill to a pattern fill from the Swatches panel.
 
 For this example, change the fill to the pattern called “Polka Dot Pattern” 
by clicking it in the Swatches panel. Then click on the Opacity link under 
that fill and change the blend mode to Saturation.
 
 
If you don’t know which pattern is the Polka Dot pattern, pause your 
cursor for a moment above each swatch. Its name pops up.
 
4. Choose the Add New Fill command from the Appearance panel 
pop-up menu or by clicking the white box at the bottom left of the 
Appearance panel.
 
 Illustrator adds another fill on top of the second one you created. With 
the new fill highlighted, change the fill to a gradient by clicking on it in 
the Appearance palette. Then click on the Opacity link under that fill 
and change the blend mode to Color Dodge.
 
5. Choose the Add New Stroke command from the Appearance panel 
pop-up menu or by clicking the black framed square at the bottom left 
of the Appearance Panel.
 
 A stroke appears on top of the original stroke. Like with the added fill 
color, the new stroke uses the same settings as the previous stroke, so 
you don’t see an immediate difference.

211
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
 
6. In the Color panel, change the color of the new stroke to green and 
change its stroke width to 18 points (pt).
 
7. Choose the Add New Stroke command from the Appearance panel 
pop-up menu or by clicking the black framed square at the bottom left 
of the Appearance Panel.
 
 Another new stroke appears on top of the 2nd stroke. Change the color 
of the stroke to Yellow and change the stroke weight to 10 points.
After you add strokes and fills, you can move them around. Simply click 
them in the Appearance panel and drag up or down. While you drag, a black 
line appears in the panel, indicating where that fill or stroke will go after you 
release it.
 
Multiple fills and strokes work great with the Transparency panel. Each fill and 
stroke can have its own Transparency settings. This approach is a great way to 
blend fills and strokes together to achieve unique appearances. For example, if 
you apply a solid color fill over a pattern fill and then change the blend mode 
of the color fill to hue, you replace the color(s) in the pattern with the color of 
the solid color but still maintain all the detail of the pattern. See Chapter 10 for 
more information on the Transparency panel and blend modes.
Changing the appearance of groups and layers
You can change the appearance of groups or layers as well as objects. 
Groups are collections of separate objects that have been grouped together 
(using the Object➪Group command) so that they act like a single object 
when you select them with the Selection tool. (See Chapter 3 for more infor-
mation on the Group command.) Similar to grouping, layers are a method of 
organizing multiple elements of your graphic into separate areas. Chapter 13 
discusses layers in depth.
To change the appearance, you need to target those groups or layers first. 
Targeting is a method of selecting a group or layer so that any changes made 
to the appearance affect all the objects in the group or layer. Changing the 
appearance of groups or layers creates a global appearance for all objects in 
the group or on the layer. Objects still maintain their individual appearance 
settings, but any group or layer changes are added to all the objects.
To change the appearance of a group by adding an effect, just follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select a group by clicking it with the regular Selection tool.

212
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
2. Add an effect to the group.
 
 Any effect would work, but if I were you, I’d add a Gaussian blur by choos-
ing Effect➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur. In the Gaussian Blur dialog box that 
opens when you choose the effect, set the Radius to 5 and then lick OK.
 
 All the objects in the group become blurred. Just like that. Wow.
I applied the Gaussian Blur effect to the previous figure. (The figures for this 
book tend to be done in Illustrator, which is an amazing coincidence.) The 
panel (a placed image) and the original path were grouped and the effect was 
applied to it, resulting in the mess you see in Figure 11-10.
On the other hand, targeting a layer to apply an effect is a little more unusual, 
since you have to use the Layer palette to “select” a layer first, as shown in 
Figure 11-11.
 
 
Figure 11-10: This is perfectly clear. When was the last time you had your eyes checked?

213
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
 
Target Layer Appearance button
 
Figure 11-11: Targeting a layer to apply an effect.
Layers are a way to organize and arrange objects in your document. (Chapter 13 
talks about layers in depth.) Every time you add an object to a layer, the appear-
ance of that object changes to match the settings of the layer. When that object 
goes to another layer with different Layer Appearance settings, the object’s 
appearance changes again.
To target and apply an effect to a layer, just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Layers.
 
 The Layers panel opens (refer to Figure 11-11).
 
2. In the Layers panel, click the Target Layer Appearance button beside 
the layer that has the appearance you want to change.
 
 The Target Layer Appearance button is the circle to the right of the 
name of the layer in the Layers panel. Clicking this circle targets the 
layer, so your changes affect that layer.
 
3. Add an effect to the layer.
 
 For this example, choose Effect➪Stylize➪Feather. The Feather dialog 
box opens. Set the Feather Radius to 5 and then click OK. All the objects 
in the layer are feathered. (Lay in a large supply of birdseed. Just kid-
ding.). Figure 11-12 shows the Feather layer with the word “feather” 
feathered.

214
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
 
 Figure 11-12: The word “feather” has been placed on its own layer and 
the layer has been given a Feather effect.
Applying effects to strokes and fills
Normally, whenever you apply an effect, it’s applied to the entire object. 
However, to keep matters interesting (or confusing), you can also apply 
any effect to either a stroke or a fill. Whichever one you change, the other 
remains unaffected, as shown in Figure 11-13.
 
Fill
Stroke
 
Figure 11-13: The Pucker & Bloat effect applied to the stroke, but not the fill.

215
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
To apply an effect to a stroke only or to a fill only, just follow these steps:
 
1. Select an object by clicking it with the Selection tool.
 
2. Choose Window➪Appearance to open the Appearance panel.
 
3. In the Appearance panel, select the stroke or the fill to which you 
want to apply the effect.
 
 For this example, select the stroke.
 
4. Choose an effect from the Effect menu.
 
 For this example, choose Effect➪Distort & Transform➪Pucker & Bloat. 
The Pucker & Bloat dialog box opens. Drag the slider towards Pucker 
(to the left) or towards Bloat (to the right). The effect applies to the path 
and takes an appropriate place in the Appearance panel.
When you look at your artwork, you see that only the stroke has been puck-
ered (or bloated, depending on what you chose). If you want to apply an effect 
just to a fill, follow the preceding steps, but select a fill instead of a stroke.
Going back to adjust settings
Any effect previously applied to an object, group, or layer can be modified. 
You can edit the effect by double-clicking it in the Appearance panel. After 
you do, the effect’s dialog box appears, enabling you to edit the current 
values for that effect. If the effect dialog box has a Preview check box, place a 
check in it and watch your changes in real time!
 
Don’t try to edit an effect you just applied by selecting that effect again in the 
Effect menu. Doing so applies the same effect a second time over the same 
path. Instead, double-click the effect in the Appearance panel.
Removing appearances
If you’re tired of keeping up appearances (for example, you feel your artwork 
is too complex and want it to be cleaner and simpler, or you added so many 
effects that printing or drawing on-screen takes too long), Illustrator gives 
you three ways to remove them (from on-screen artwork, that is). You can 
take an appearance apart (one attribute at a time), trash the whole appear-
ance except the basics, or zap everything at once. Here’s how you accom-
plish each of these tasks:
 
✓ To get rid of a single effect, transparency setting, stroke, or fill: Select 
what you want to remove in the Appearance panel and then click the 
little trashcan icon at the bottom right of the panel.

216
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
✓ To get rid of all effects, extra fills and strokes, and transparencies: 
Click the Reduce to Basic Appearance button (the button with the circle 
with a slash running through it at the bottom center of the panel). This 
action strips away everything except one stroke and one fill color and 
resets the Default Transparency setting to a blend mode of normal and 
an Opacity setting of 100%. (See Chapter 10 for more details on blend 
modes and Opacity settings.)
 
✓ To clear everything: If you really want to clear the decks, leaving a path 
with no strokes or fills whatsoever, click the Clear Appearance button 
(the circle with a line through it at the bottom left of the panel).
 
Note that the Appearance panel always shows a Fill color, Stroke color, 
and default Opacity setting for an object, even after you throw them away. 
Throwing away a fill or stroke automatically sets it to None; throwing away a 
transparency sets it to the default Opacity setting, which is a blend mode of 
Normal and an Opacity setting of 100%.
 
If you’re wondering what the last three buttons in the Appearance panel 
do, here’s the skinny. The FX button provides superfast access to the Effect 
menu (the entire menu magically appears right at the button!). The dog-eared 
page icon is the Duplicate button. Select the appearance effect or attribute 
(stroke or fill) you want and click this button to create a duplicate. The trash 
can icon will delete any line item(s) you choose in the appearance palette.
Killing live effects until they’re dead
Sometimes, you want to preserve the way an object looks, but get rid of all the 
things in the Appearance panel. One reason to do this is that all these multiple 
fills, strokes, and effects can take tremendous processing power when they are 
live. This situation can result in long print times, or long times redrawing when-
ever you make a change to your graphic. The drawback to live effects is that 
they are previews and need to be recalculated every time you make a change. 
You can kill these live effects so that they permanently change your graphic. 
You can no longer make individual adjustments to them or remove them, but 
all the calculations have been made and the graphic has been permanently 
changed. This results in a much simpler, if limited, graphic.
To permanently set all the live effects, choose Object➪Expand Appearance. 
The object expands, which is a completely counterintuitive way of saying the 
object gets simpler. All the settings made in the Appearance panel are really 
just previews. They haven’t been applied to the graphic. Every time you make 
a change, that appearance needs to be completely recalculated. Expanding the 

217
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
object applies all those changes to it permanently, so the calculations don’t 
have to be made again. The graphic is simpler, if less editable. Figure 11-14 
shows the difference between live and, um, dead objects.
 
 
Figure 11-14: A live effect (left) and after Expand Appearance is applied (right).
Figuring Out Styles
Styles are collections of colors, transparency settings, effects, and additional 
fills and strokes that can be applied to any path, group, or layer. Just think of 
all that information in the Appearance panel. Saving it and applying it to dif-
ferent objects (without having to re-create all those settings) can significantly 
reduce the time and effort you spend. That’s the advantage of using styles.
Another advantage is that any update in the style changes all the objects to 
which you apply that style. For instance, if you apply a style with a red fill 
and black stroke to a path, and later you update the style to an orange fill, the 
object you previously applied that style to changes to an orange fill and black 
stroke.
Applying styles to objects
Illustrator comes with a whole slew of premade styles that are stored in the 
Graphic Styles panel and in premade libraries that ship with Illustrator (see 
Figure 11-10), ready for you to use with just a click.

218
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
To apply a style to an object, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select an object.
 
2. Choose Window➪Graphic 
Styles.
 
 The Graphic Styles panel 
appears. Figure 11-15 shows 
styles from the default Style 
library as well as styles from 
other libraries included with 
Illustrator.
 
3. Click a thumbnail style in the 
Graphic Styles panel.
 
 Doing so automatically applies 
all the settings to the selected 
object.
Creating and editing 
styles
You can create a style from any selected object in the document. You can 
also create a style based on the current Appearance panel settings. (The 
Appearance panel contains the settings for the last object selected, even if 
that object isn’t currently selected.)
 
1. Select an object (or not, as the case may be).
 
 If you don’t select a path, the style you create adopts the current set-
tings in the Appearance panel.
 
2. Open the Graphic Styles panel by choosing Window➪Styles.
 
 The Graphic Styles panel (shown in Figure 11-16) appears.
 
3. Click the New Style button (the middle button at the bottom right of 
the Graphic Styles panel) or simply drag your object onto an empty 
space in the Graphic Styles panel.
 
 A thumbnail representation of the new style appears in the Graphic 
Styles panel.
Figure 11-15: Styles examples.

Break Link to Style button
New Style button
 
Figure 11-16: The Graphic Styles panel.
You have more than one method available to edit an existing style. Regardless 
of the method you use, Illustrator automatically updates all the objects that 
have that style applied to them to match the new style. The basic way to edit 
an existing style is to redefine it.
 
After you apply a style to an object, you can click the Break Link to Style 
button on the Graphic Styles panel to prevent Illustrator from updating the 
object to a new style if you redefine the existing one.
To redefine an existing style, just follow these steps:
 
1. Create a basic shape and apply a style to it.
 
 In this instance, I created a triangle by using the Basic Shapes tool. Then 
I chose Window➪Graphic Styles and applied the style Bermuda to the 
triangle by clicking that style in the Graphic Styles panel.
 
2. Edit the selected object as you normally would to create the new 
appearance that you want.
 
 Change the fill and stroke, and/or add effects. In this case, I chose a darker 
fill color and added two strokes of different colors to the triangle by using 
the Add New Stroke command in the Appearance panel pop-up menu 
(which I describe in the “Adding fills and strokes” section of this chapter).

220
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
 
3. After you’re satisfied with the changes, open the Appearance panel by 
choosing Window➪Appearance. With the altered object still selected, 
choose Redefine Graphic Style Style Name from the Appearance panel 
pop-up menu, accessed by clicking the triangle in the upper-right 
corner of the Appearance panel and shown in Figure 11-17.
 
 
Figure 11-17: Redefining an existing style.
 
 You’re replacing a style, but you have to do it through the Appearance 
panel. Go figure! Because the name of the style I edited in this example 
was Scribble, the menu reads Redefine Graphic Style “Scribble.” The menu 
changes to whatever name the style has been given.
 
 Illustrator updates the style in the Graphic Styles panel with the changes — 
and updates any object in the document that has that same style applied 
to it.
Another way to edit an existing style is to replace it with another set of 
Appearance settings. Set the fill, stroke, and effects for an object to make it 
look the way you want. Then hold down the Alt key (Option on a Mac) and 
drag the object over the thumbnail of the style that you want to replace 
in the Graphic Styles panel. It might look as if you’re dragging that entire 
object into the Graphic Styles panel, but you’re just dragging its fill, stroke, 
and effects settings (in other words, its appearance). To let you know that 
the object is in the proper position to replace the existing style, a black 
border appears around the style. Release the mouse to update the style to 
the Appearance settings of the selected object. Illustrator also updates all 
objects that share the style.

221
 Chapter 11: Effectively Keeping Up Appearances, with Style(s)
Spotting the difference between graphic 
and text styles
The Illustrator graphic styles are different from its text styles. (Text styles 
are discussed in Chapter 14.) Graphic styles specify graphic attributes, such 
as fill color, stroke color, transparency, additional strokes and fills, and 
any applied effects. Text styles (Illustrator has two types: Character and 
Paragraph) specify text attributes, such as font, size, leading, alignment, and 
other Character panel and Paragraph panel settings.
The Illustrator graphic styles don’t allow you to save text attributes, such as 
font and alignment, with them. However, you can apply graphic styles to text 
and text objects; the graphic styles just don’t apply any text-specific attributes.
Applying graphic styles to text
Illustrator looks at text as a picture of letters and numbers — not as letters 
and numbers — and then applies a graphic style to that picture, as shown in 
Figure 11-18.
 
 
Figure 11-18: Text before (top) and after (bottom) a graphic style is applied to it.

222
Part II: Drawing and Coloring Your Artwork 
To apply a graphic style to text, just follow these steps:
 
1. Select text by using the Selection tool.
 
2. Display the Styles panel by choosing Window➪Graphic Styles.
 
3. Click a thumbnail in the Graphic Styles panel to apply that style to the 
text.
 
 Illustrator applies the graphic style you select to the text object.
You can quickly apply a style to text or other objects by selecting the style 
you want and then clicking with the Paint Bucket (which is located in the 
same Tools panel slot as the Eyedropper tool) on anything you want to 
change to that style. (It’s so much easier than dragging a real paint bucket. 
And you don’t have to worry about the carpet. Is Illustrator great, or what?)

pixels, anyway? But you’ll keep quiet on that 
around them and just continue to amaze and

A
rt that you create in Illustrator can be modified in a number of ways. 
Perhaps the most powerful of these ways are transformations and dis-
tortions. These enable you to bend, move, and manipulate paths and other 
Illustrator objects like silly putty, shaping them to your every whim. (Power 
mongers, rejoice!)
In this chapter, you find out how to use the many Illustrator trans-
formation tools to alter the shape of your artwork in any way 
you desire. For the more extreme stuff — we’re talking real 
distortion here – check out Bonus Chapter 1, available 
for download from the Web site associated with this 
book. 
Understanding the Five 
Transformation Sisters
You can do five fundamental things to paths: move, 
scale, rotate, reflect, and shear. Each of these trans-
formations has both a tool and a dialog box associated 
with it. Move actually has three tools, if you count all the 
arrow tools (each of which are used to move selections).

226
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
The key to using all these tools (and their control-freak dialog boxes) is to 
select what you want to change first and then to apply the transformation. 
Use the Selection tool when you want to transform an entire object (Shift-
click with the Selection tool to transform multiple objects simultaneously) or 
use the Direct Selection tool to transform just a few points at a time.
Move
Illustrator enables you to move objects simply by clicking and dragging them 
with any of the selection arrows. Figure 12-1, for example, shows an object 
moved from one spot to another. The original illustration (left) is modi-
fied (right) by using the Selection tool to move Joey the chit up into the air. 
(Suddenly the chit seems to defy gravity.)
 
 
Figure 12-1: The original illustration (left) is modified (right) by using the Selection tool.
Sometimes, you need to move a selection a specific amount. Suppose you 
draw a flower (or a weed, if your drawing skills aren’t quite up to par yet), 
and you want to move this flower exactly one inch to the right.
To specify how much you want to move your object, follow these steps:
 
1. Select your artwork and choose Object➪Transform➪Move.
 
 The Move dialog box appears (see Figure 12-2).
 
 You can also double-click any of the three arrow tools to access the 
Move dialog box.

227
 Chapter 12: Pushing, Pulling, Poking, and Prodding
 
2. In the Distance field, type how far you want 
the object to move; in this case, type 1 in.
 
3. Type 0 in the Angle field.
 
 Setting the Angle field at 0 ensures that the 
object moves directly to the right without 
shifting up or down. Leave the other fields at 
their default settings.
 
4. Click OK to exit the Move dialog box.
 
Okay, so you might wonder how Illustrator 
knows to move the flower just an inch to the  
right, instead of to the left. Well, Illustrator knows 
because the number you entered in the text field 
is a positive number. If you enter a negative number, the object moves to the 
left. In fact, the only way to move something to the left in the Move dialog 
box is to enter a negative number in the Horizontal text field. If you do that, 
the Angle field automatically changes to 180 degrees, which is to the left (0 
degrees is to the right).
 
Tell Illustrator the appropriate measurement unit with these symbols: in for 
inches, p for picas, pt for points, cm for centimeters, mm for millimeters, or 
px for pixels.
Scale
To make something bigger or smaller in Illustrator, you scale it. Illustrator has a 
Scale tool, a Scale dialog box, and a Scale function as part of the bounding box 
that surrounds an object after you select it with the Selection tool. Not only can 
you make an object bigger or smaller, but you can also squish an item to change 
its size. For instance, you can make an item twice as high but the same width as 
it was originally. Figure 12-3 shows what happens when you scale an object.
 
 
 Figure 12-3: The original artwork (left) scaled smaller (center) and larger (right).
Figure 12-2: The Move dialog 
box.

228
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
 
The easiest way to scale art is not to use the Scale tool but to use the bounding 
box that appears around objects after you select them with the Selection tool. The 
bounding box enables you to scale and rotate artwork. To scale artwork, click and 
drag the handles (big, black squares) around the outside of the artwork.
If you hold down the Shift key while you drag the bounding box handles, you 
constrain the sizing of the bounding box (and the artwork) so that the width 
and height are scaled proportionately. This is typically a good thing because 
it prevents your artwork from getting really, really fat or really, really skinny 
while you scale it.
 
Holding down the Shift key while you use any of a variety of tools keeps the 
object constrained. For instance, with the Rotate tool, holding down the Shift 
key constrains rotation to 45° increments (a nice angle sideways, another 
nice angle upside down, another nice angle sideways the other way, and 
finally one more lovely angle straight up).
The bounding box is nice and all, but you don’t find Illustrator Knights of the 
Galaxy using it because they like doing things the hard way (you know, greater 
evidence of artistic prowess, more prestige). The Scale tool is definitely more 
difficult to use than the bounding box for resizing artwork, but the Scale tool also 
has all sorts of capabilities that the bounding box doesn’t have, such as scaling 
from a specific origin, using specific values, and copying as you scale. Locate 
these buried treasures by double-clicking the Scale tool in the Tools panel.
As a certain short, green, levitating philosopher once said, “Try not. Do. Or 
do not. . . .” Well, okay, you can just try the technique, as shown in Figure 
12-4, if you want to. (The galaxy isn’t at stake here.) Figure 12-4 shows the 
original artwork selected (left); the light blue preview that appears when you 
drag with the Scale tool (center); the final scaled artwork (right).
To scale your artwork with the Scale tool, just follow these steps:
 
1. Select your artwork using the regular Selection tool.
 
 
2. Choose the Scale tool.
 
 
 The Scale tool icon is supposed to look like a small box being resized 
into a bigger box. Really. (Call it artistic license.)
 
3. Click at the corner of the artwork and drag.
 
 By default, the Scale tool scales from the center of the selection. When 
you drag, a light blue preview of your artwork appears, indicating the 
size and shape that your graphic will be after you release the mouse.
 
 Drag away from the graphic to enlarge it; drag toward the center of the 
graphic to shrink it.
 
4. Release the mouse button when the art is the size you want.
 
 The artwork scales to that size.

229
 Chapter 12: Pushing, Pulling, Poking, and Prodding
 
 
 Figure 12-4: Original artwork (left), light blue preview (center), and the final scaled artwork (right).
 
All you accuracy addicts out there (you know who you are) can double-click the 
Scale tool in the Tools panel to indulge your habit: The Scale dialog box appears 
and offers a nice blank space in which you can type an exact scale percentage. 
(Some folks just have a hankering to know what an object looks like at 183 per-
cent or 0.5597 percent of its current size.) You can also access this dialog box by 
choosing Object➪Transform and choosing your desired transformation.
But wait, there’s more! You also have an option for choosing a Uniform or Non-
Uniform scale change. Well, no, choosing Uniform won’t dress up the object 
in khakis. Instead, the object acts as if you pressed some super Shift key and 
ends up looking like a bigger or smaller version of the original, identically pro-
portioned (nary a squish anywhere). A Non-Uniform scale change enables you 
to enter separate scale percentages for horizontal or vertical measurements. 
In addition to scaling objects themselves, you can also scale patterns and/
or strokes and effects, if your object(s) contains any of these attributes. See 
Chapter 5 for more on patterns and strokes and Chapter 11 for more on effects.
 
Not content with scaling from the center? The two-click method of using the 
Scale tool might soothe your yearning for alternatives. It enables you to move 
the origin point around the screen before scaling. The origin point is a place 
tacked to the Artboard around which the rest of the artwork scales. Normally, 
the origin point is in the middle of the selection, but you can put the origin point 
anywhere, even outside the selection! Just select the Scale tool from the Tools 
panel and click once before you do the click-and-drag routine to scale the object. 
Illustrator resets the origin point to the location where you single-clicked.

230
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
 
If you drag back across the origin point (or the middle if you didn’t set one) 
while using the Scale tool, you might well flip the artwork over. That’s a little 
disconcerting, but as long as you don’t release the mouse button, you can 
always drag back and fix it. If you do release the mouse button, you can undo 
(choose Edit➪Undo).
Rotate
Spinning your artwork around in circles is a good way to whittle away an 
afternoon. Sometimes, I just sit, click, and spin, watching the artwork rotate 
on-screen. It’s mesmerizing. Then again, I don’t really get out all that much.
 
 You can use the funky corner arrows in the bounding box (which shows up 
when you have something selected with the regular Selection tool) to rotate 
things around or you can use the aptly named Rotate tool. The Rotate tool 
(like the Scale tool) enables you to set the origin point, which is the location 
the artwork rotates around. Double-clicking the Rotate tool also enables you 
to set a specific angle of rotation. Figure 12-5 shows artwork before and after 
it’s rotated with the Rotate tool.
 
 
Figure 12-5: The original artwork (left) and after it’s rotated (right).
Reflect
With the Reflect tool, you can flip a selection over any axis, making a mirror 
image. Figure 12-6 shows original artwork before and after it’s flipped over a 
90° axis.

231
 Chapter 12: Pushing, Pulling, Poking, and Prodding
 
 
Figure 12-6: Reflecting the artwork with the Reflect tool.
To use the Reflect tool to create a mirror image, just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the artwork to be reflected.
 
 
2. Choose the Reflect tool from the Tools panel.
 
 
3. Press and hold the Shift key. (Release it after you release the mouse 
button in Step 5.)
 
 The Shift key constrains the reflection to a 45° angle, which makes a 
horizontal reflection easier to accomplish. (Who knew it took so much 
work to be a beam of light? Other than Einstein. . . .)
 
4. Click the far-right edge of the selected artwork and drag to the left.
 
5. Release the mouse button (and then the Shift key) after the artwork 
“flips” over.
But that’s not all! If you act now and double-click the Reflect tool, you get the 
Reflect dialog box (shown in Figure 12-7) absolutely free! Here are its exciting 
capabilities:
 
✓ Horizontal: Select this radio button to flip the image upside down while 
you reflect it.
 
✓ Vertical: Select this radio button to flip the image over while you reflect it.
 
✓ Angle: Select this radio button to rotate the image to a specified, um, 
angle while you reflect the image.

232
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
Shear
Most programs call this skew, but Illustrator 
takes the high road and uses a lofty aviation term. 
It’s commonly used for creating cast shadows 
(the kind that fall away from an object, like your 
own shadow does on a sidewalk on a sunny 
afternoon, also known as perspective shadows) 
or cast reflection (like a still lake reflecting 
autumn trees).
The Shear tool can be tricky to use because it can 
quickly zip out of control and turn your artwork from a mild-mannered logo 
into something resembling Timothy Leary’s nightmares. When you click and 
drag with the Shear tool, everything on the side of the origin point moves 
to where you drag it while everything on the other side of the origin point 
moves an equal distance in the opposite direction. The artwork between dis-
torts accordingly, and you get a slanted version of your artwork. If you drag 
too far or in the wrong direction, it’s back to the land of funky spastic visions 
of inkblots.
 
To make the Shear tool easier to use, always use the two-click method. 
Before you drag with the Shear tool, click at the edge of the selected artwork 
to set the origin point. When you do this, you have to pay attention only to 
your artwork shearing in one direction. The overall effects are the same, but 
you don’t have to worry about the artwork shearing in both directions.
To use the Shear tool
 
1. Select the artwork to be sheared.
 
 
2. Choose the Shear tool from the Tools panel.
 
 
 The Shear tool hides behind the Scale tool in the Tools panel. Click and 
hold the Scale tool, and the Shear tool pops out from behind it.
 
3. Click once at the edge of the 
artwork to be sheared.
 
 This sets the origin point, 
making the Shear tool easier to 
control.
 
4. Drag with the Shear tool.
 
 The artwork shears, or distorts, 
to look slanted, as shown in 
Figure 12-8.

box.

shearing (right).

Additional Transformation Tidbits
All this transforming might seem like some pretty amazing stuff. What’s really 
amazing is the bevy of little extras that Illustrator has thoughtfully provided 
to make transforming easier and faster. The following sections in this chapter 
show you how to use these extras. Here’s a list of what you can do:
 
✓ Use the Transform panel. This panel keeps all the transformations in 
one handy place, where you can apply them by typing in numerical 
values.
 
✓ Copy while you transform. Rotate a copy of your artwork.
 
✓ Transform each piece of artwork separately. The Transform Each 
dialog box enables you to apply transformations to individual objects, 
instead of to everything at once. This feature is useful, believe it or not.
 
✓ Repeat the last transformation. Do it again . . . and again . . . all with a 
simple menu command (or keystroke).
 
✓ Transform a portion of a path. That’s right, you can select just a few 
points and move, scale, rotate, reflect, or shear them. (This capability is 
especially useful if you want to give that virtual caterpillar a Mohawk.)
The Transform panel
The Transform panel, shown in Figure 12-9, is a one-stop shopping location 
for all your transformation needs. Access the panel by choosing Window➪
Transform. The panel’s quite powerful, as long as you don’t mind the math.
By entering values in the Transform panel’s fields, artwork can be moved, 
scaled, rotated, and sheared. The panel pop-up menu has options for reflect-
ing (Flip Horizontal and Flip Vertical) as well as options for scaling strokes 
and effects and transforming the object, the pattern, or both. The W and H 
(width and height) fields can take both absolute 
measurements (sizes specified in inches, centime-
ters, and so on) or relative measurements defined 
by percentages. Just type the little extra bit after 
the number that specifies what kind of measure-
ment the number represents — in for inches, cm 
for centimeters, or % for a percentage. You can 
also type in the rotation and shear degrees in the 
two boxes at the bottom (or choose a preset from 
the drop-down menus).
 
If you hate to crunch numbers, rejoice! The Transform panel does the math 
for you! For instance, if you want an object to be one-third as wide as it cur-
rently is, just type /3 after the current value in the text box for width, and the 
artwork will shrink to 1/3 of its original width.
Figure 12-9: The Transform 
panel in all its glory.

234
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
Copying while transforming
All five Illustrator transformation functions enable you to copy objects as well 
as transform them. To accomplish this dazzler, Illustrator applies the trans-
formation to a copy of the original selection, just as if you used cut-and-paste 
to copy the object, pasted it directly on top of the original, and applied the 
transformation. In Illustrator, you can do all that in one step.
When using the transformation tools, you can press Alt (Option on a Mac) to 
make a copy of your selection while transforming. Just press Alt (Option on 
a Mac) after you start dragging (not before) and hold it down until after you 
release the mouse button. Illustrator creates a duplicate of the selection.
 
Illustrator users do this sort of thing so often that they invented a couple of 
terms (Alt-drag for PCs, Option-drag for Macs) to mean copy an object. (Nine 
times out of ten, it means move a copy.)
Figure 12-10 shows how a sample of type looks after you transform it with the 
Shear tool while holding down Alt (Option on a Mac). To get this cool cast 
shadow with the Shear tool, I copied the text object and filled with a gradient. 
The result is a cast shadow that appears in front of the original type (which 
Illustrator treats as an object). 
 
 
Figure 12-10: Get a cool cast shadow with the Shear tool.
 
If you’re using a dialog box to accomplish a transformation, click the Copy 
button instead of OK to create a transformed duplicate of the object. The origi-
nal artwork stays untransformed.
Transform Each
The Transform Each dialog box (see Figure 12-11), accessed by choosing 
Object➪Transform➪Transform Each, does two things: First, it brings most 

235
 Chapter 12: Pushing, Pulling, Poking, and Prodding
of the transformations together into 
one dialog box. Second, it applies 
transformations to each of the 
selected objects separately, instead 
of all at once.
Oddly enough, this approach results 
in an effect that bears almost no 
resemblance to transforming every-
thing at once. Figure 12-12 shows 
the results of regular rotation versus 
the results of rotation using the 
Transform Each dialog box. (Just 
don’t say I didn’t warn you.)
Transform Again
After you transform something, you can repeat the transformation quickly by 
choosing Object➪Transform➪Transform Again; the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+D 
(Ô+D on a Mac). This action simply repeats the previous transformation — 
whether by tool or dialog box or panel — and applies that transformation to 
the current selection. You can even deselect something, select something 
else, and apply the same transformation to the new selection.
 
 
 Figure 12-12: Original artwork (left) after it’s rotated with the Rotate tool (middle) and using the 
Transform Each dialog box (right).
Figure 12-11: The Transform Each dialog box.

236
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
The Transform Again command also 
works with copying selections, as 
shown in Figure 12-13. Here, the little 
“Clarks” around the circle were made 
with the Transform Again function 
by rotating a copy around the center 
in 18° increments.
Partial transformations
If you select just a section of a path, 
you can apply the five basic trans-
formations to it, just as you do with 
an entire object. The result can be 
quite ordinary (as when you move a 
few points around) or rather unex-
pected (as when you scale, shear, 
or reflect just a few points), as 
shown in Figure 12-14.
 
 
Figure 12-14: Moving and scaling a portion of a path.
The following steps select, move, and scale just a few points on a path (with 
some interesting results):
 
1. Using the Direct Selection tool, click and drag over a portion of a path.
 
 While you click and drag with the Direct Selection tool, a rectangular 
marquee appears. Only the points inside this marquee are selected.
 
2. With the Direct Selection tool still selected, click a selected (solid) 
point and drag.
 
 All the selected points move along with the one you click and drag. Be 
sure to click directly on a point that you selected (indicated by a solid 
point); otherwise, you’ll accidentally drop the selection and select some-
thing else.
Figure 12-13: Repeat a transformation to the 
current selection.

 Chapter 12: Pushing, Pulling, Poking, and Prodding
 
 
3. Release your mouse, choose the Scale tool, and then click the same 
point as Step 2 and drag.
 
 
 Dragging toward the middle of the selected points brings the points 
closer together. Dragging away moves them farther apart.
 
 Don’t click too near the middle of the points, or they get all cantanker-
ous and hard to control.
Blending: The Magic Transformation
This section covers what may well be the oddest feature in Illustrator. 
Illustrator can blend one path into another. For instance, you can blend the 
shape of a fish into a lowercase letter f. The result is a series of paths that 
slowly transform from one path into another. In addition to the shape changing 
from one path to another, the color (and style, if one exists) changes as well.
 
Sound familiar? No surprise. The results look a lot like the morphing effect 
you see in every werewolf-vampire-alien-shapeshifter movie made in the past 
20 years.
Only paths can be blended together. The paths can be open (lines, curves) 
or closed (shapes such as circles and squares). They can also contain either 
solid colors or gradients. You can select any number of paths and blend them 
together, as shown in Figure 12-15.
 
 
Figure 12-15: Creating a blend between three objects.
To create a blend that takes the artwork from one path to another, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Create two paths on opposite sides of the document.
 
 
2. Choose the Blend tool from the Tools panel.

238
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
 
3. Click one path, click the other 
path, and watch the blend 
appear.
 
 The number of objects between 
the two original paths depends 
on how different the colors are.
 
4. (Optional) To specify the 
number of steps between the 
paths, double-click the Blend tool.
 
5. In the Blend Options dialog box that appears, as shown in Figure 
12-16, select Specified Steps from the Spacing drop-down menu and 
enter the number of steps you want between the two paths. Click OK.
 
 Illustrator creates the number of objects you specify between the two 
original paths.
Other options are available in the Blend Options dialog box besides the 
Specified Steps option. The Smooth Color option lets Illustrator automatically 
calculate the number of steps for the blend, which allows for a smooth transi-
tion of color and shapes. The Specified Distance option specifies the distance 
between steps in the blend based on the edge of one object to the edge of the 
next object. You can also specify the orientation of your blend — either with 
the Align to Page orientation or the Align to Path orientation. The icons for 
each give you a visual of each orientation.
 
You can also edit your blends with selection tools, such as the Arrow or Lasso 
tools, or with the Rotate or Scale tools. If the blend still doesn’t meet your 
expectations as you make your edits, you can undo a blend by choosing 
Object➪Blend➪Release.

▶ Aligning objects
A
good way to think about how Illustrator objects relate to one another is 
to consider Illustrator objects like construction paper cutouts. You can 
arrange them any way you want, but in all likelihood, some will overlap. Each 
piece of paper can then be tucked behind another piece or pulled out in front 
of another piece. Doing so results in totally different results, even 
though the paper cutouts never really change.
In this chapter, I focus primarily on stacking objects — 
tucking them behind each other or bringing them for-
ward to upstage each other — and show you how to 
deal with stacking as easily as possible. In addition, 
a later section scrutinizes precision placement and 
aligning of objects. 
Stacking Illustrator Artwork
Illustrator automatically accomplishes front-to-back 
positioning for you in a straightforward, logical way. 
Each new object that you draw, place, or paste is posi-
tioned in front of the last object that you drew, placed, or 
pasted, resulting in a stack of artwork.

240
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
Unless you apply transparency 
(as I detail in Chapter 10), objects 
positioned in front of other objects 
tend to knock out the portions of 
the objects that they overlap. Figure 
13-1 shows Illustrator objects (cards) 
stacked in three different arrange-
ments. The cards are in the same 
locations, but their stacking order 
is different. The result is completely 
different artwork in each example.
Stacking order
Illustrator treats on-screen objects 
as if they were playing cards stacked 
neatly on a table (or not so neatly, 
as in Figure 13-1). (Think of yourself 
as standing next to the table and 
looking straight down on them. All 
the individual cards cannot be seen. 
You only see the topmost card.) 
Stacking order is the order of objects 
in the stack. The order of the objects 
in the stack is typically determined 
by when they’re created or placed in the document, although you can 
change this order by using an Object➪Arrange command. (Read more on the 
Arrange commands in the upcoming section “Moving art up (front) or back 
(down) in the stacking order.”) The first object created sits at the bottom of 
the stack. In Illustrator, this is referred to as the Back. The next object cre-
ated is in front of that object, and the most recent object created sits on top 
of all the others. The topmost position is considered to be the Front.
Figure 13-2 shows a top down view of a stack of cards and an imaginary side-
edge view of that same stack as it would appear from the side.
Even when two objects appear visually side by side and don’t overlap in any 
way, Illustrator still considers one object to be in front of the other — as if 
each object that you create in Illustrator were painted on a separate piece of 
transparent plastic. Often, the only time you can know the stacking order is 
when you move one object in front of another. That’s the only time you need 
to know the stacking order because stacking order makes a difference only 
when objects overlap. When objects overlap improperly (like if a big yellow 
triangle hides the word YIELD that you really want in front of the triangle), 
you turn to the Arrange commands to change stacking order, as spelled out 
in the next section.
Figure 13-1: These arrangements of cards 
are a result of changing the stacking order of 
the objects.

241
 Chapter 13: Organizing Efficiently
 
 
Figure 13-2: From above (left) and from the side (right).
Moving art up (front) or back (down) 
in the stacking order
Illustrator offers the following five commands to move objects up and down 
through the stacking order:
 
✓ Object➪Arrange➪Bring to Front: This command brings selected art-
work to the top of the layer you’re working on (more about layers in the 
next section) by putting that artwork in front of the other objects.
 
✓ Object➪Arrange➪Send to Back: This command moves selected artwork 
to the bottom of the layer you’re working on by putting that artwork 
behind the other objects.
 
✓ Object➪Arrange➪Bring Forward: This command brings selected art-
work forward (that is, upward in the stack) one step at a time.
 
✓ Object➪Arrange➪Send Backward: This command puts the selected art-
work farther back (that is, downward in the stack) one step at a time.
 
✓ Object➪Arrange➪Send to Current Layer: This command moves the 
selected artwork from the layer it resides on to the layer selected in 
the Layers panel. For more on layers, see the section “Using the Layers 
panel” coming up in this chapter.
 
Illustrator uses stacking order to keep track of all the objects on-screen, even 
when they don’t overlap. The Bring Forward and Send Backward commands 
affect the stacking order, regardless. Whether you send an object backward 
or bring it forward, you may not see any difference if nothing’s overlapping. 
Don’t panic! The object really did move in the pecking order.

242
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
Managing the Mess
Although the commands for moving artwork may seem fairly flexible at first, 
that’s true only if you keep the number of objects limited. After you start 
creating artwork with dozens (or even hundreds) of objects in it, the first 
four commands start showing their limitations and causing frustration. For 
instance, think of the hassle of putting an object in a precise order when you 
have a hundred different levels in the stack (“Move it from level 94 to level 
63? Sure, no problem.” Right.), not to mention the challenge of selecting one 
object from among hundreds!
That situation is where the Layers panel comes in. Not only does it enable 
you to organize your artwork into layers, but it also gives you a much more 
flexible method of arranging your artwork within the stacking order. You 
can also do fiendish things to layers, such as hiding them so you can’t see 
them, or locking them so you can see them but can’t change them or dupli-
cate them (along with their artwork) in a different document. This flexibility 
brings a great deal of sanity to working with complex illustrations.
Imagine that you’re creating an image of a flock of birds in a maple tree. Your 
client wants to see the tree change according to the four seasons. She also 
wants to see the tree with and without the birds. You have 1 tree, 50 birds, and 
hundreds of leaves — and the whole image is set in spring. Oh, and the client 
is coming over to see the finished artwork in 15 minutes! Do you panic? No, 
you use layers! You separate the tree, birds, and leaves into separate layers. 
Then you can hide and reveal the bird layer to show the tree with and without 
the birds. Hide the layer with the leaves on it, and you have your maple tree in 
winter! To simulate seasons, duplicate the leaves layer twice. Then, again using 
the Layers panel, you can select all the leaves in one layer and change the 
fill colors to summer colors. Then go to the third leaf layer and change those 
colors to fall colors. By showing one layer while hiding the other two, you can 
create your fall, spring, and summer trees. There you have it! Eight pieces of 
artwork from one piece, in about as much time as it takes to describe it!
Using the Layers panel
The Layers panel, shown in Figure 13-3, provides you with the means to do as 
much (or as little) organization as you want. You can split your artwork into 
layers, sublayers, and sublayers of those sublayers. Then you can view, hide, 
select, rearrange, or delete any number of the layers and sublayers.
Thumbnails
The thumbnails on the Layers panel show what objects are on each layer. You 
can quickly select everything on that layer by clicking the Target circle. In addi-
tion, clicking the Target circle (to the right of each layer) enables you to apply 
Transparency settings and effects to that layer, as I discuss in Chapter 10.

243
 Chapter 13: Organizing Efficiently
 
Is the thumbnail too small to get an 
accurate view of the artwork? Select the 
Panel Options option from the Layers 
panel pop-up menu. The thumbnail size is 
determined by the row size. Choose from 
small, medium (the default size), or large; 
or choose the Other setting and type in 
any pixel size for your thumbnails.
I call it layer cake . . .
If you haven’t opened the Layers panel 
before, you might be surprised to find 
that you’ve been working with layers all 
along. Whenever you create a new docu-
ment, Illustrator automatically creates a 
layer to contain your artwork.
When you work with multiple layers, 
you might have to get accustomed to the 
Arrange commands, such as the Bring 
Forward and Send to Back commands. 
These commands work within layers but 
don’t move objects from one layer to 
another. After you select an object and 
choose Object➪Arrange➪Bring to Front, 
Illustrator brings the object to the front of the layer that it currently occupies — 
but not all the way to the front of the document. So, if another object is hanging 
around in a layer in front of the selected object and you use the Bring to Front 
command, the selected object might still be behind another object in the docu-
ment. If this happens, you can use the Object➪Arrange➪Send to Current Layer 
command, or you can use Steps 3 and 4 in the following list to move artwork into 
another layer.
A good way to get a feel for the Layers panel is to break a piece of existing 
artwork into several layers, as shown in Figure 13-4.
To separate your artwork into multiple layers, just follow these steps:
 
1. Decide how you want to organize your artwork.
 
 You might want to split it into similar elements — such as type, pixel 
images, graphics, and a background.
 
2. Create the additional layers you need for your artwork by clicking the 
Create New Layer button — click once for each additional layer.
 
 The Create New Layer button is the third button from the left at the bottom 
of the Layers panel; it looks like a sheet of paper with the bottom-left corner 
folded up to reveal a second sheet of paper underneath it. You can also 
choose the New Layer option from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
Figure 13-3: The Layers panel with multiple 
layers.

244
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
 
3. With the Selection tool, select the graphic element in your artwork 
that you want to move to one of the other layers.
 
 After you select the art, a little square appears to the right of the layer 
that currently contains the selected artwork.
 
4. To move the art to another layer, click and drag the little square up or 
down in the Layers panel to the layer you want.
 
 When you release the mouse button, the artwork has already changed 
layers. You might not see any apparent change in the artwork, but 
moving the artwork into a new layer changes the color of the selection 
highlights (the tiny, on-screen squares and lines that appear along the 
points and paths after you select something with any selection tool). 
The color changes to the selection highlight color for the new layer. It’s 
a dead giveaway. Figure 13-5 shows a document (with objects selected) 
right next to the Layers panel for that document. Note how the color 
paths/points for objects on each layer have the same color as their cor-
responding layers in the Layers panel.
 
5. Repeat the previous two steps until all your artwork is in the correct 
layers.
 
Create New Layer button
 
Figure 13-4: Placing existing artwork into multiple layers.
Changing the stacking order of layers
Layers, like individual objects, have a stacking order. This order is reflected in 
the Layers panel. The contents of layers at the bottom of the panel appear in 
back of the contents of layers at the top of the panel. To change the stacking 
order of a layer, click the name of the layer or its thumbnail and drag upwards 
or downwards in the Layers panel. While you drag, a black bar appears 
between layers to indicate where the layer will be moved to after you release 
the mouse. When this black bar is at the position you want the layer to occupy, 
release the mouse. The layer and all its contents move to that position.

245
 Chapter 13: Organizing Efficiently
 
 
 Figure 13-5: The objects on each layer have paths and points colored the 
same as the layer that they are on.
Lock and Unlock, View and Hide
Well, no, I’m not suddenly writing rhythm-and-blues lyrics. You can lock 
layers by clicking the Lock/Unlock toggle button (the square just to the right 
of the eyeball icon — it’s empty when unlocked and shows a little padlock 
when locked). Clicking it causes it to do the opposite of whatever it’s cur-
rently doing. If a layer is unlocked, for example, clicking the Lock/Unlock 
button locks the layer. If a layer is already locked, clicking the Lock/Unlock 
button unlocks the layer. So far, so good. But potential frustrations lurk.
When a layer is locked, you can see it, but you can’t select it or alter it in any 
way. If you try to select anything in a locked layer, you select only the object 
behind it. After you get accustomed to this state of affairs, you find that 
layers are a great way to get things out of the way that you aren’t working on 
and to preserve any artwork that you don’t want accidentally changed.
Just to the left of the Lock/Unlock button is the View/Hide button (which 
looks like an eye). Why hide all that work? One word: safety. This button 
not only hides the artwork in the layer, but it also locks the artwork so you 
can’t accidentally change it. The View/Hide button is also a great way to get 
things out of the way and to prevent accidents. It’s also a great way to create 
multiple versions of artwork by showing and hiding different elements. (You 

246
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
know — trees with several sets of leaves for different seasons, or football 
players with several uniforms, depending on their contracts. . . .)
 
Hidden artwork is always locked artwork. If it weren’t locked, you could 
change that poor, hapless object without meaning to — because you can’t 
see hidden artwork. (Wow. Sometimes obvious stuff is so comforting.)
Copying layers (quickly and completely)
You can copy a layer — along with all the artwork it contains — by clicking 
the layer and dragging it on top of the Create New Layer button, which is just 
waiting around at the lower edge of the Layers panel, hoping that somebody 
will give it something to do. This technique is a great way to create multiple 
versions of artwork. You can duplicate one element many times, and then 
change the appearance for each layer. Show and hide the layers to compare 
and contrast the different versions.
 
To create a new sublayer (a layer within a layer), click the Create New 
Sublayer button at the bottom of the Layers panel (the little piece of paper 
directly to the left of the trash can icon), or select the New Sublayer option 
from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
Viewing objects and groups
When you click the little triangle to the far left of 
a layer’s name, you see an instant panorama of 
the groups and objects on that layer, as shown 
in Figure 13-6.
Using your options on layers, 
groups, and objects
You can give each layer, group, and object in 
Illustrator a name. If you don’t name them, they 
wander around despondently, lugging their 
default names (such as <path> and Layer 1). 
Naming layers can be a great help for locating dif-
ferent objects. (Those teensy thumbnails can be 
awfully hard to distinguish.) Naming the layers 
provides you with instant recognition.
To change a layer’s name, double-click that 
layer in the Layers panel. To change the name 
of a group, double-click that group in the Layers 
panel. And finally, to change the name of an 
Figure 13-6: View a layer’s 
contents.

247
 Chapter 13: Organizing Efficiently
object, double-click that object in 
the Layers panel. (Is there an echo 
in here? Nope, just consistency — 
part of good software design.) The 
Layer Options dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 13-7.
The Layer Options dialog box offers 
several other options beyond just 
naming layers:
 
✓ Name: Use this text box to type in a descriptive name for the layer.
 
✓ Color: Set the selection highlight color here. Changing this option 
doesn’t change any color in the artwork — just the color used to show 
that something is highlighted.
 
✓ Template: Selecting this check box enables you to give the layer a spe-
cial designation and the following unique set of behaviors (which tells 
you that the layer is a template):
 
• The layer is automatically locked so nothing on it can be selected or 
changed.
 
• By default, pixel-based artwork shows as dimmed, which allows you 
to focus on your own artwork better while still being able to see 
the template artwork. Think of the layer as virtual tracing paper. 
You can, however, uncheck (deselect) this option if you so desire.
 
• The names of the Template layers are italicized, so they’re easy to 
spot in the Layers panel.
 
• Template layers do not print, and they aren’t included with your art-
work when you use the Save for Web & Devices command.
 
• You can create a different version of a particular piece of artwork 
and put the existing artwork in a Template layer where it’s out of 
the way. It won’t print, but you can still see it.
 
✓ Lock and Show: These options can be checked and unchecked to enable 
you to perform the same function as selecting the Lock/Unlock and 
View/Hide buttons in the Layers panel.
 
✓ Preview: Selecting this check box allows you to see your artwork in 
Preview mode. When unchecked, it displays the current layer’s artwork 
in Outline view; all other artwork in the document remains in Preview view.
 
✓ Print: This option can be checked or unchecked to make the layer print-
able or not printable.
 
✓ Dim Images To: This option enables you to dim pixel-based artwork 
to any set percentage. You might want to do so for tracing purposes 
so that you can focus on your Illustrator artwork while using the faded 
pixel artwork as a guide.
Figure 13-7: The Layer Options dialog box.

248
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
 
You can move objects, groups, and layers around inside the Layers panel, 
doing all sorts of strange things to your artwork. You can move objects from 
one layer to another, move groups inside other groups, and even nest layers 
by dragging them inside each other. Try doing this and watch out for surprises.
Imposing Slavish Conformity with Groups
Grouping objects is a great way to organize your artwork because it gives 
several objects a common address, so to speak, where Illustrator can find 
them. After you click any one of them with the Selection tool, you automati-
cally select all the objects in the group.
To create a group of objects, select the objects that you want to include 
and then choose Object➪Group. You won’t see any physical change in the 
artwork, but from that point onward, all objects in the group are selected at 
once (provided that you use the regular Selection tool to select them).
 
The main difference between layers and groups is that grouping organizes 
objects by their relationships to other objects rather than by their position inside 
a layer. As any former high-school student can tell you, belonging to a group 
means having to conform to its rules. Consider these rules, for example:
 
✓ Grouped objects must exist in the same layer. You accomplish this by 
selecting two objects in different layers and grouping them. The bottom-
most object gets moved into the layer that the topmost object inhabits.
 
✓ Groups can be grouped. You accomplish this by selecting two or more 
groups and choosing Object➪Group. If you have two groups called 
Football Team and Cheerleaders, for example, you can group them in 
another group called Stadium.
 
✓ Grouped objects can be ungrouped. You accomplish this by selecting 
the group and choosing Object➪Ungroup. (Or maybe you can get an 
object in the group to do something uncool. . . .)
See Chapter 6 for more information on selecting groups.
Lining Up
Illustrator provides several ways to make things line up as neatly as possible. 
Instead of just eyeballing the things in the line (which sounds sort of icky), 
you can have Illustrator help you make sure everything lines up just right. In 

249
 Chapter 13: Organizing Efficiently
fact, so many ways to align things exist that you don’t need to figure out all 
the different methods. Just pick the one that makes sense to you and use it.
Two of the more-arcane-but-useful functions in Illustrator are tricky to find 
and use, but are worth the effort:
 
✓ Snap to Point: This function (choose View➪Snap to Point) snaps your 
cursor to a nearby point (on a path) whenever you’re near to it. This 
function is perfect for butting objects up against each other.
 
✓ Constraining via Shift. This function (hold down the Shift key after you 
make your selection) constrains movement of objects to 0, 45, or 90 
degrees (and all sorts of combinations thereof).
 
 If you want your objects to move in a constrained fashion, make sure 
that you hold down the Shift key after you make your selection and keep 
holding it down until after you release the mouse button. If you hold the 
Shift key down before you make your selection, you add that selection 
to anything else you already selected. If you let go of the Shift key before 
you let go of your mouse button, you release the constraint, and the 
object is positioned someplace far from where you want it to be.
Guides that are truly smarter than most of us
What if Illustrator knew what you were thinking? Science fiction? Maybe. But 
Illustrator is smart enough to know what you want to align — if you turn on 
Smart Guides, that is (by choosing View➪Smart Guides). These little help-
ers come out and start drawing temporary guides for you all over the place. 
Suddenly you can align objects in all sorts of ways.
Here’s how this feature works. When the Smart Guides feature is on, it 
watches you work. When your cursor passes over different objects, Smart 
Guides draws lines from the points that you drag over, showing you how they 
align, and highlights the paths of objects as you pass over them. Beware, 
though: After you start using them, it’s really, really hard to stop. Figure 13-8 
shows the highlighting of a path when the cursor is placed over it. The cursor 
was placed over the collar object, causing it to “light up” with the layer color 
(red) because Smart Guides was turned on. 
Let the rulers guide you . . .
You can create a guide of your own if you drag out from one of the rulers 
(click the ruler and drag it into the document). Think of these guides as indi-
vidual grid lines. You can use them to align artwork horizontally or vertically 
wherever you want without having your whole screen become littered with 
grid work like you do whenever you choose View➪Show Grid.

250
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
 
 
Figure 13-8: Using Smart Guides.
Unlike Smart Guides, the guides you create on your own give you no addi-
tional information about your artwork. They’re just lines that hang out 
behind your artwork to use as a point of reference, like the blue ones shown 
in Figure 13-9. When View➪Snap to Grid is turned on, objects snap to guides 
as well (even if you aren’t using a grid).

251
 Chapter 13: Organizing Efficiently
 
 
 Figure 13-9: Guides (bright blue lines) were used to keep objects lined 
up while being placed.
You can drag out as many of these guides as you want or need. To move a 
guide that you dragged out, choose View➪Guides➪Lock Guides and toggle 
the option off. Then click and drag the guide that you want to move. You can 
also press the Delete key after clicking a guide to remove it altogether. This 
action lets you customize your guides so that they’re in the exact position 
you need to help you with the specific artwork you’re creating.

252
Part III: Taking Your Paths to Obedience School 
 
Lock your guides after you move them by choosing View➪Guides➪Lock 
Guides and toggling the option on.
I’m a path, I’m a guide
You can turn any path into a guide by selecting the path and choosing 
View➪Guides➪Make Guides. That means circles, squares, wavy lines, or an 
entire logo can be used as a guide . . . basically anything you might want to 
quickly align to. You can also turn any guide back into a path (even the ruler 
guides) by selecting it and choosing View➪Guides➪Release Guides. Guides 
need to be unlocked and selected for this to work. 
If you need to move or delete a single guide, you can press Ctrl+Shift (Ô+Shift 
on a Mac) and then double-click the guide to unlock it and change it into a 
path. (Just press the Delete key afterward to make it disappear.)
 
You can always clear out all the guides in a document by choosing 
View➪Clear Guides.
Alignment
The Illustrator Align panel enables 
you to align and distribute selected 
objects just by clicking a button. 
Open the Align panel (shown 
in Figure 13-10) by choosing 
Window➪Align. The little pictures on 
each button in the panel show what 
the button does after you click it.
The top row of buttons aligns 
objects. You can align objects hori-
zontally or vertically. If you align 
objects horizontally to the left, 
Illustrator aligns the leftmost points 
in the objects. If you center objects 
horizontally, Illustrator aligns the centers of the objects.
The final location of the objects might seem a little random at times because 
the Align command aligns them to a point that is the average of the loca-
tions of the objects. For instance, if you align two objects vertically by their 
centers — and one object is on the right side of the page and the other is on 
the left side — the objects will align somewhere near the center of the page. 
To get them exactly where you want them, you may need to click and drag 
Figure 13-10: The Align panel.

253
 Chapter 13: Organizing Efficiently
the objects with the Selection tool after you align them. Still, the Align panel 
saves you a whole lot of time getting there.
The bottom row of buttons distributes objects. In other words, these but-
tons move selected objects so that they are the same distance apart. The 
Distribute Objects option takes the two objects that are the farthest apart 
and distributes the remaining objects between these two objects.
Using the Align panel is a good way to align things you created in Illustrator 
and simply need to straighten up a bit. If everything you created is all helter-
skelter (or just helter work with), Align adjusts your artwork until it looks 
just right. Or left. Or centered. (It’s pretty handy and politically neutral.)
If you think the buttons on the Align panel look familiar — that you’ve seen 
them before — you’re probably right. Most of the Align panel buttons are 
available in the Control panel at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 
13-11. For most of your aligning work, you can simply click the button you 
need there, without ever having to open the Align panel.

Practically 
Speaking: Type, 
Print, and Files

O
ne picture is worth a thousand words. But if 
you create those words in Illustrator, each 
word — no, each letter — is a work of art. Which 
means a sentence is worth about 17 billion words. 
(I’m estimating, seeing as how I don’t have a calcu-
lator handy.)
In this part, you master creating type, and then 
you’ll become the expert you always knew you 
could be when it comes to the practicality of 
printing, taking your art to the Web, and working 
with other applications.
If you do the math of pictures being worth words, 
and words being knowledge, and knowledge being 
power, then by the end of this part, you’ll be the 
most powerful person in the universe!

T
ype is undoubtedly one of Illustrator’s strongest areas. All the things that 
Illustrator does best — logos, advertisements, posters, and Web-page 
graphics — depend upon text and typography. Many Illustrator fea-
tures interact with type in some way; and the program’s type 
capabilities are pretty straightforward — that is, after you 
know where they are and what they can do.
In this chapter, I discuss Illustrator type. (If you’re 
already familiar with controlling type in Microsoft 
Word or some other piece of word-processing soft-
ware, you’re already familiar with many of these 
terms.) To ease the journey, this chapter covers 
locating the Illustrator controls — and deciphering 
the Illustrator way of doing things. Finally, I describe 
how to get the most out of type and how to turn 
Illustrator from a glorified word-processor into an 
astounding type-modifying tool that can do just about 
anything to type you could think of.

258
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Using the Word Processor from Outer Space
If you think of Illustrator type capabilities as an extended word-processing 
program, you’re in the right ballpark; people frequently mention Illustrator’s 
amazing typographical control. The basics of type (such as fonts, size, and 
alignment) work much the same in Illustrator as they do in most software 
programs. Illustrator also packs some advanced typographical capabilities, 
such as saving files in four of the most universally recognized file formats 
(PDF, EPS, GIF, and JPEG). What sets this program apart from the rest is that 
you can do wonderful things with type and use it just about anywhere. 
Controlling type in Illustrator
Illustrator has a variety of places where you can work with type options, such 
as the Type menu; and the Character, Paragraph, Character Style, Paragraph 
Style, and OpenType panels. Ninety-five percent of what you need, however, 
resides on the Character and Paragraph panels, shown in Figure 14-1. These 
two panels are essential knowledge for Illustrator users, which is why I devote 
much textual real estate to them later in this chapter. For now, though, I’d like 
to point out that a good grasp (so to speak) of the Type tool(s) in the Tools 
panel is equally important. The next section tells why.
 
 
Figure 14-1: The Character and the Paragraph panels.
The Type tool(s)
You don’t need anything but the Type tool to create type although the Type 
tool by itself won’t let you change anything about your type.
Several type tools hide behind the standard Type tool. Although they’re con-
venient for quickly creating type on a path, area type, or vertically oriented 
type, you can get away with using only the standard Type tool — if you know 
a few clever shortcuts. To make type on a path with the standard Type tool, 

259
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
just click any open path with it; the type flows on the path. To make type flow 
within an area, just click a closed path with the standard Type tool, and your 
type fills the path.
Starting with the Type tool, follow these steps to create type:
 
 
1. Choose the Type tool (which looks like a letter T ) from the Illustrator 
Tools panel.
 
2. Click where you want the text to start.
 
 A flashing insertion point appears. (If you accidentally click and drag at 
this point, you create a text box that contains your type. For more infor-
mation on the text box, see the next series of steps.)
 
3. Start typing.
This process is the most basic way to create type. What you actually do in 
the preceding steps is create point type, which is a single line of type that 
doesn’t wrap (move to the next line) automatically, as shown in Figure 14-2. 
You have to press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) if you want to add a line 
beneath this line; otherwise, the line you’re typing continues to infinity.
 
 
Figure 14-2: Point type in Illustrator.
You can also create area type (type that’s confined within a closed shape) 
with the Type tool, like the type shown in Figure 14-3. Just follow these steps:
 
 
Figure 14-3: Area type in Illustrator.
 
1. Choose the Type tool from the Tools panel.

260
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
2. Click and drag with the Type tool.
 
 While you drag, a rectangular marquee grows from the cursor. You can 
type text only inside the area of the marquee.
 
3. Release the mouse button.
 
 A flashing insertion point appears in the upper left of the text box.
 
4. Start typing.
 
 When you reach the right edge of the text box, the text wraps to the next 
line.
In both cases, you create a type object. You can treat this type object like any 
other Illustrator object. (After you select it, the familiar path and point sym-
bols show up to indicate the selection.)
 
With both point type and area type, you can always get to the next line by 
pressing Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) on the keyboard.
The Character panel
The Character panel (choose Window➪
Type➪Character) is where you make 
changes to individual characters (let-
ters, numbers, and punctuation). Figure 
14-4 shows the expanded Character 
panel (all options displayed) with all the 
pieces labeled. The drop down menus 
next to each entry field allow for quick 
access to commonly-used values.
To make text changes via the 
Character panel, first select the text 
you want to change. You can select 
text in three ways:
 
✓ Click the text with the regular 
Selection tool. This action selects 
all the text in the text object. Even 
though the text isn’t highlighted 
(rather, it has a simple underline, 
or the outline of a rectangle), you 
can still change the size, font, and 
alignment.
 
✓ Click and drag the Type tool 
across the type that you want to select. When you click and drag, a black 
box appears behind the selected text to indicate that the text is selected 
(highlighted). Only highlighted text is changed.

 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
 
 
If you click and drag too far away from your targeted text, you make a 
new text box instead of selecting the text.
 
 Pay attention to the Type tool cursor because it always alerts you as 
to what the tool is going to do. When the cursor is in position to create 
a new text box, a dotted rectangle appears around it. If it’s in the right 
place to select text, the dotted rectangle disappears. To select text, click 
and drag when you see only the I-beam text tool cursor with no box 
around it.
 
✓ Double- or triple-click with the Type tool. Double-clicking a word 
selects the entire word. Triple-clicking selects the entire paragraph in 
which the word appears.
The Paragraph panel
The Paragraph panel (shown in 
Figure 14-5) is where you make 
type changes that affect whole 
paragraphs. If you haven’t dealt 
with this feature in other soft-
ware, you might be in for a bit of a 
tussle. To view the panel, choose 
Window➪Type➪Paragraph. Then 
things start to get a little strange.
To Illustrator, a paragraph consists 
of the type contained between 
hard returns, which typically look 
like this: ¶. Even if you type only 
one letter, press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac), and type another 
letter, Illustrator considers 
each of those letters as separate 
paragraphs.
 
You don’t have to select an entire paragraph for the Paragraph panel func-
tions to make changes. Paragraph panel changes affect the entire paragraph, 
regardless of what you select. For instance, even if you highlight only a single 
letter, changing a paragraph option affects the entire paragraph — not just 
that single character. In fact, you don’t even need to select anything to make 
paragraph changes. Just click the paragraph you want to change with the 
Type tool (you see a blinking insertion point where you click), and para-
graph changes you make then affect the entire paragraph. All options in the 
Paragraph panel are designed to affect an entire paragraph, regardless of the 
selection, and are discussed later in this chapter in more detail.

Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Introducing the Strange Land of Type
Although much of Illustrator might seem new and different, it describes type 
with a language steeped in centuries of tradition (not to mention years of 
Illustrator history), so while some of the terms may sound strange, feel confi-
dent that you could discuss a lot of these concepts with Gutenberg’s buddies.
Fonts, typefaces, and font families
Although maybe you’ve heard these terms used interchangeably, fonts, type-
faces, and font families actually have distinct meanings. For this book’s pur-
poses, I deal primarily with fonts. Fonts are sets of common letterforms that 
give consistent, distinct designs to the entire alphabet, all the numbers, and a 
boatload of symbols. Figure 14-6 shows a variety of fonts.
 
 
Figure 14-6: Several different fonts.
You change fonts in Illustrator quite easily by following these steps:
 
1. Using either the Type tool or a selection tool, select the type you want 
to modify.
 
2. Choose Window➪Type➪Character.

263
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
 
 The Character panel appears. 
The family name of the selected 
font appears at the upper left of 
the Character panel. Below the 
Font Family name is the Font 
Style box, with a downward-
pointing triangle just to the right.
 
3. Click the downward-pointing 
triangle next to the Font 
Style box.
 
 A pop-up menu presents you 
with a list of all the fonts on 
your computer, as shown in 
Figure 14-7.
 
4. Pick a font from the list and 
click its name.
 
 After you release the mouse 
button, the selected text 
changes to the font you chose.
 
Illustrator doesn’t have buttons for making fonts bold and italic. (Grumble.) 
However, programs with such features are usually faking it because not 
every font family has genuine bold and italic versions. If a program takes the 
non-italic version and tilts it (or the non-bold version and thickens it), the 
resulting false impression can waste money. The faux bold and italics might 
look okay on-screen, and even print out okay on an inkjet printer. But when 
an image-setter (a professional high-resolution printer) rejects them as fake, 
they show up on the page as the ordinary non-bold, non-italic fonts that they 
are — after you had costly films made.
While you peruse the list of fonts, notice that the font styles appear in sub-
menus of the main list. This feature shows you related versions of a particular 
font. For instance, Figure 14-8 shows samples of three font styles in the Myriad 
Pro font family. All are in the same submenu of the Myriad Pro menu item. Font 
styles in the same font family have a similar look and work well together.
 
 
Figure 14-8: These font styles are part of the Myriad Pro font family 
 
and look good placed together.
Figure 14-7: A scrollable list of fonts appears 
in the Character panel.

264
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Serif and sans serif
Fonts are generally divided into two categories: serif and sans serif. Serif 
fonts have little doohickeys — serifs — on the tips of letters and numbers. 
Sans serif fonts don’t have them. (In this case, sans means “not gonna happen 
here.”) Figure 14-9 shows examples of serif and sans serif fonts.
 
 
Figure 14-9: Serif (top) and sans serif (bottom) fonts.
Why choose serif or sans serif? Traditionally, serif fonts are used for large areas 
of small text because the serifs make the text easier to read. Sans serif fonts are 
used for larger type in headlines because they stand out more boldly. However, 
as wider ranges of fonts have become available to wider ranges of users, more 
people are breaking the traditional font-choice rules. Traditional usage isn’t always 
the case anymore. Books and magazines still use serif fonts (more than sans serif 
fonts) for long passages of text, but you can find many exceptions to the rule. Sans 
serif type is often easier to read on-screen; those little serifs are frequently just too 
small to display properly on low-resolution computer screens.
 
When you’re creating for print, a wise idea is to print your Illustrator text 
throughout the creative process. The printed page can differ slightly from 
what you see on-screen. If you’re creating text for Web graphics, consider 
yourself lucky; when you have your graphics and the text looking good on-
screen, mission accomplished!
 
To make Illustrator show as closely as possible what your text will look like 
on the Web, choose View➪Pixel Preview.
The biggest Don’t Do It that I can think of
Back in 1987, when Illustrator and PageMaker just hit the scene, many com-
puter users without an artistic bone in their bodies created documents and 
graphics. They got carried away with the computer’s magnificent ability to 
mix and match fonts. The printed results often looked short of professional: 
busy, trashy, and hard to read. Lately, font madness has struck again — with 
Web pages — so your loyal author makes this impassioned plea:
Don’t use too many fonts on the same page the way I just did.

265
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
What’s too many? Well, the awful no-no I just inflicted on the page has five. 
If you run out of fingers (on one hand) while counting fonts, you have too 
many. The classic limit is three fonts (including any bold or italic versions of 
the main font you’re using).
Exploring Size, Leading, and Other 
Mysterious Numbers
The world of type has a lot of measuring associated with it. You have to keep 
in mind point size, leading, x-height, kerning, baseline shift, tracking, hori-
zontal scale, vertical scale, em-width, and other matters that only the Secret 
Brotherhood of Typesetters really cares about. All these numbers affect the 
appearance of your type. Some of these measurements are important; some 
of them aren’t. The following sections let you in on which is which — and 
on how to understand and use each type setting in Illustrator. Figure 14-10 
shows the Character panel settings for each of the different blocks of type, 
using an abbreviated view of the Character panel.
Measuring can be just plain odd
The size of type is measured in points. An inch has 72 points (pt). A quarter-
inch is 18 points (pt). That’s the easy part. The hard part is that type isn’t 
measured from top to bottom. Rather, type is measured from its ascenders 
and descenders for the entire font. You know those cute little tails that hang 
down from the lowercase g, j, p, q, and y? Well, those tails are descenders; the 
ascenders are the upper parts of letters, such as the tall parts of lowercase d 
and k and of UPPERCASE letters.
Some words, such as anon (all lowercase, no ascenders or descenders), 
seem to have a smaller type size than words such as Mr. Ripley, even though 
they’re the same type size. Type is measured from the uppermost point to 
the lowermost point that is possible to create using that font. Even if you 
aren’t using any ascenders and descenders in the words that you’re typing, 
the font size has to leave room for them (see Figure 14-11) in case words, 
such as Rumpelstiltskin or syzygy, show up in the sentence.
Things get really wacky when you mix different fonts. Each font can have com-
pletely different heights for its ascenders and descenders, creating the appear-
ance of completely different font sizes, even though the actual space from the 
topmost point to the lowest point for both entire alphabets is identical.
 
For another example, sneak a peek at the mishmash of fonts I stuck in the 
earlier section, “The biggest Don’t Do It that I can think of.” They’re all 
12 pt fonts.

266
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
 
Figure 14-10: Character panel settings for different type blocks.
You can set the point size of your type in the Character panel, right below 
the font. Pick a value from the pop-up menu or type in a value in the field pro-
vided and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac).
Two good guidelines are that capital letters are about two-thirds the point 
size, and lowercase letters without descenders or ascenders (like a lowercase 
a) are about one-half the point size. So if you want a letter a that’s one inch 
(72 pt) high, you have to specify it as 144 pt (two inches) tall.

267
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
 
Ascenders
Descenders
 
 Figure 14-11: Font size allows enough space to accommodate all the possible ascenders and 
descenders in a font.
Measuring can be just plain annoying
The space between rows (lines) of letters has an even stranger story. This 
space is its leading. Second, the space is measured not between the descend-
ers of the line you’re on and the ascenders of the line below (which would 
make sense), but rather, between the baseline of the line you’re on and the 
baseline of the line above the line you’re on. The baseline is the line on which 
most letters rest (those that don’t have descenders). Figure 14-12 shows how 
leading appears in a typical paragraph.
 
 
Figure 14-12: Leading is the space between the baselines of type.
You set the leading in the spot to the right of the font size in the Character 
panel. If a number appears in parentheses, that’s the automatic value of the 
leading — 120 percent of the point size, rounded up to the next half point.

268
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
If the amount of leading matches the point size, the descenders of one line 
touch the ascenders of the line below. In the majority of cases, that’s a large 
no-no.
Spacing out while staring at type
Yet another thing to worry about (or ignore, if you choose to) is the space 
between individual letters that are next to each other. This space can be 
called two things (specifically to confuse the novice):
 
✓ Tracking: The space between letters in a series of letters
 
✓ Kerning: The space between two specific characters
Figure 14-13 shows the difference (sorta) between these two.
 
 
Figure 14-13: Tracking (top) and kerning (bottom, between the K and e).
Change the kerning by placing your cursor where you want to change the 
space between two characters. Change the tracking by highlighting a series 
of characters. Then change the appropriate field in the Character panel, as 
indicated in Figure 14-14.
Typically, you can leave these values alone. However, when setting short sets 
of large type, for example, the type can look much better when it’s kerned 
more tightly. Many rules and guidelines exist for proper kerning and tracking, 
but the best designers set these by eye. If the type looks good, it’s probably 
kerned correctly.

269
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
Putting type on the rack
You can stretch your type to make 
it wider or taller. By changing the 
values in the Vertical Scale and 
Horizontal Scale boxes (shown 
in Figure 14-15), you can reshape 
type into all manner of oddness. (If 
you don’t see these boxes in the 
Character panel, double-click the 
title tab of the panel to expand it.)
 
In general, this sort of modification is 
frowned upon, unless used sparingly 
and only to produce a small degree 
of change. Stretching type distorts it, 
making it more difficult to read, and 
also tends to really irritate the origi-
nal designer of the typeface. 
Moving on up and down
Whereas leading sets how far apart 
the lines of text are, the baseline 
shift controls the vertical position 
of the text after it’s been moved via 
the leading value. Use the field at the 
bottom of the Character panel to change the baseline shift. Positive numbers 
move selected text up; negative numbers move selected text down. Figure 
14-16 shows a paragraph with a word of text that has a shifted baseline.

Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Adjusting Entire Paragraphs
The Paragraph panel provides controls for modifying all the text in a para-
graph at once. These controls are quite different from those in the Character 
panel. (Don’t want any silly old consistency to spoil the fun, now do we?)
Changing the alignment of a paragraph
At the top of the Paragraph panel are seven buttons that set the alignment 
of paragraphs. Although the buttons are tiny, if you squint hard enough at 
them, you can see that the tiny graphic image on each one mimics the align-
ment that they create. Position the cursor over the button without clicking 
and a tooltip appears and tells you what it is.
To align a paragraph, click anywhere inside it with the Type tool; then click the 
alignment button in the Paragraph panel. By default, paragraphs align to the 
left side with their right edge ragged (uneven). Choose the Align Right setting, 
and the opposite is true (right edge smooth, left edge ragged). Try the Align 
Center setting for ragged left and right edges with centered lines of text. Use 
the Justify Full Lines setting for straight left and right edges (except for the 
last line if it’s not a full line). Finally, the Justify All Lines setting keeps all lines 
(including the bottom one) even on both the left and the right. Figure 14-17 
shows examples of these alignments.
Changing the space around the paragraph
The Paragraph panel in Illustrator offers options for adjusting the space 
around a paragraph, plus an option to set how far from the left edge of the 
paragraph the first line starts. Figure 14-18 shows these options.
Use the Left Indent setting for modifying the position of the left edge of 
the paragraph. The larger the number, the farther to the right the left edge 
moves.
Use the First Line Left Indent setting to move the first line of the paragraph left 
or right relative to the left edge of the paragraph. Use a negative number to make 
the first line come out from paragraph’s left edge, as shown in Figure 14-19. Use a 
positive number to push the first line in to the right of the paragraph’s left edge.
Use the Right Indent setting to adjust the paragraph’s right edge. The larger 
the number, the farther to the left the edge moves.
Use the Space Before Paragraph setting adjusts the amount of space before 
the current paragraph. If you select a bunch of paragraphs, changing this set-
ting puts space between each one of the paragraphs.

271
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
 
 
Figure 14-17: Text results of different text alignments in Illustrator.
Use the Space After Paragraph setting 
to adjust the amount of space after 
the current paragraph. If you select 
a bunch of paragraphs, changing 
this setting puts space between each 
one of the paragraphs. If you enter 
a value for Space Before and Space 
After, you’ll get the sum of both 
values between your paragraphs.

With the basic options available in Character panel and the Paragraph panel, 
you can create astounding feats of typestry. These two panels provide the 
core for nearly everything you do with type in Illustrator. Using them, you 
can equal or surpass just about anything you can create on a single page in 
any word-processing or page-layout application.
Using Type as a Mask
Illustrator enables you to do a remarkable number of things to your type, but 
some modifications seem forbidden. For example, if you try to fill type with a 
gradient (read through Chapter 5), the type just turns black. And what if you 
want to get really fancy and fill text with another piece of artwork that you 
create in Illustrator? There’s just no way you can do that!
Or is there?
By using the Clipping Mask feature (read more about this in Chapter 10), you 
can create the appearance that text is being filled with a gradient, artwork, or 
anything that you can put the text in front of. And what can’t you put text in 
front of? Absolutely . . . nothing! (Say it again, y’all. . . .)
A clipping mask is a special feature of Illustrator: It uses the front-most object 
(the clipping object) to hide the objects behind it in a unique way. Everything 
outside the clipping object is hidden, and the fill and the stroke of the clip-
ping object become transparent, enabling you to see whatever’s behind and 
apparently filling the clipping object. A type mask is what you get when you 
use type as your clipping object. This might sound strange but makes a lot 
more sense after you create a type mask of your own.

273
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
Creating a type mask is simple. Here’s how:
 
1. Create the artwork you want to fill your type with.
 
 
This can be absolutely anything. The only catch is that it must be bigger 
than the type that you want to use as fill.
 
 For example, if you want to fill your text with a gradient, create a rect-
angle (or any other object, provided that it’s larger than your type) and 
fill it with a gradient (see Chapter 5), or create the artwork that you 
want to fill the type with. You can even use a pixel-based image, such 
as a scanned photograph of your loved one. The only stipulation is that 
whatever you fill the text with must be larger than the text. Think of 
the text as a cookie cutter and the object you’re filling the text with as 
cookie dough. You cut away everything outside the text.
 
2. Create type in front of whatever you want to fill the text with.
 
 Create your type by using the ordinary Type tool. From the Character 
panel, choose a font size large enough that the type is almost (but not 
quite) as large as the artwork behind it. If you already created your type, 
select it with any selection tool and choose Object➪Arrange➪Bring to 
Front and drag it in front of your object.
 
3. Use any selection tool to select the text and the object or objects 
behind the text and then choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.
 
 To select multiple objects, just hold down the Shift key while clicking 
each of them with any selection tool.
 
 After you choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make, the fill and stroke of the 
text disappear and are replaced by the contents of whatever is behind 
the text. Anything outside the area of the text becomes invisible, or 
masked-out, like the example in Figure 14-20.
 
With type masks, the text is still ordinary text. You can highlight the text, 
change the font, type in different words, and so on, while retaining the mask-
ing properties.
Any time you want to make the text stop masking out what’s behind it, select 
the text and choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Release.

type area.
Converting Type to Paths
The type possibilities in Illustrator are nigh infinite. To make them truly infi-
nite, you need take only one step — convert the type to paths. You gain abso-
lute control over every point of every letter of every word of type.
 
Edit carefully and spell-check the text before you convert it. After you con-
vert text to a path, you can’t edit it as type. You also can’t highlight it with 
the Type tool and retype it, change the font, or anything editorial like that.
Here are some reasons why you’d want to make this conversion:
 
✓ To manipulate type like you do any other object in Illustrator: Type 
stops being type and becomes just another Illustrator path, at which 
point you can do absolutely anything to it that you can do to other 
paths, specifically using the Direct Selection tool on individual points 
and segments of those paths.
 
✓ To bypass the need for the font files associated with the type: If you 
give someone a graphic file containing a font that isn’t installed on the 
recipient’s computer, the graphic won’t display or print properly if 
opened in Illustrator or placed into a page-layout program. However, 
converting the type to paths creates a file that displays and prints 
exactly as you created it, regardless of the fonts installed on the recipi-
ent’s computer.

275
 Chapter 14: Introducing Letters and Such (Type 101)
 
 This action is also a good way to make sure that the text can’t be 
retyped. You should always convert text to paths for any logo that you 
send to other people, which helps guarantee that the logo always looks 
how you created it.
To convert type to paths, as shown in Figure 14-21, follow these steps.
 
 
1. Use the Selection tool to select the type that you want to convert to a 
path.
 
 Okay, you’re altering type, so you should be able to do this by using the 
Type tool — but you can’t. This is just one of those little frustrations 
that have been around for years in Illustrator.
Figure 14-21: Left: The letter A as type. Right: The letter A converted to paths.
 
2. Choose Type➪Create Outlines.
 
 All the points that make up the 
type suddenly appear, enabling 
you to edit the type as you would 
edit any other object in Illustrator 
(as shown in Figure 14-22). Here’s 
the same letter A from Figure 
14-21 after the points are moved 
and a gradient fill is applied. Why 
the name Create Outlines? Only 
some long-gone Adobe program-
mer knows for sure. A better name 
may be Create Paths from Text, 
which is what this command really 
does.

points are moved and a gradient fill is

Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Type Styles
Illustrator has the concept of styled type, through paragraph and character 
styles. Styles are just a fancy name for a collection of character or paragraph 
attributes that allow you to make several changes at once.
For instance, maybe you want to use the exact same font, point size, and jus-
tification for all your type in a document. Instead of changing each of the set-
tings each time you create a type object, use a style to change all the settings 
at once. Even better, if you decide that the initial font, or size, or justifica-
tion needs changed, simply update the style, and all the type with that style 
applied changes instantly!
Of the two types of type styles in Illustrator, Paragraph styles are much more 
common and powerful. Not only do they contain all the attributes you find in 
the Paragraph panel, but also all the character attributes as well. Character 
styles contain only character attributes (and are useful for type within para-
graphs, where you don’t want an entire paragraph to change).
To unleash all that power, you’ll first need to call up the Paragraph Styles 
panel by choosing choose Window➪Type➪Paragraph Styles from the main 
menu. Then, to actually create a 
paragraph style, set up your type 
just the way you want it to appear, 
and then click the New Style button 
in the Paragraph Styles panel (the 
little piece of paper directly to the 
left of the trash can icon; see Figure 
14-23). To apply that style to type, 
select a type object or make a selec-
tion with the Type tool, and then 
click the name of the style once in 
the Paragraph panel.

W
hen designing your artwork, keep in mind how it will look if it will be 
printed. If you know what medium you’re going to print your artwork 
on, you can save yourself time in the long run. For instance, say you create a 
stunning logo, full of vibrant colors and subtle hues and reflections. Well, you 
probably can’t use that logo in a black-and-white context. In this chapter, I 
provide some great ideas to keep in mind while you create your artwork — and 
you can also refer to this chapter when you arrive at the printing process.
If you just want to print, read the next section. If you want to dis-
cover all the stuff behind what goes into printing, check out 
the upcoming section “What You See Is Roughly What 
You Get.” Or, if you want the nitty-gritty about setting 
up Illustrator for printing (plus even more details on 
printing), skip ahead to the section “Setting Up Your 
Page to Print (You Hope).”
Printing Quickly
If you have a printer hooked up to your computer or 
network, you can print just about anything that you 
can create in Illustrator.
Before you print, make sure that your artwork is inside 
the printable area, which is indicated by a dotted gray line. 
Anything outside the dotted line doesn’t print. If you don’t see a dotted gray 
line, choose View➪Show Page Tiling. To hide the line, choose View➪Hide 
Page Tiling.

278
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
To print your artwork, choose File➪Print. When the Print dialog box appears, 
press Enter (Return on a Mac), or click the Print/OK button. You now have a 
printed version of your Illustrator creation. Pressing Enter (Return on a Mac) 
without adjusting any settings in the Print dialog box is known in the trade 
as running with the defaults. Defaults are settings that are made automatically 
when you install Illustrator, and they work just fine for printing artwork from 
Illustrator. When your creations don’t print as you expect them to, however, 
you need to adjust the other settings, which I discuss throughout this chapter.
What You See Is Roughly What You Get
Whatever you create on-screen, you can print (theoretically). And what you 
print looks pretty much like what you see on your monitor. Note that I say 
pretty much and not exactly. Here’s why:
 
✓ Resolution differences: Your monitor resolution is much lower than 
your printer resolution. If you think everything you print will look better 
than it does on-screen, you’d be correct — in most cases. 
 
✓ Aliasing differences: By default, Illustrator displays art and text on your 
monitor as anti-aliased (the edges where colors meet blend together, 
producing a more visually appealing image on-screen). Printed pages are 
not anti-aliased, and images print crisply and cleanly, with no blurring of 
edges. Figure 15-1 shows the crisp edges of Rocky the Meeple on the left, 
compared with a zoomed-in screen representation of Rocky. Note that 
the pixelized edges on the right image are anti-aliased, smoothing out 
the curved edges of the blue meeple.
 
 
Figure 15-1: Crisp printed meeple, left vs. blurred anti-aliased screen meeple, right.

279
 Chapter 15: Printing Your Masterpiece
 
✓ Color differences: Your monitor displays color images by lighting up 
little red, green, and blue phosphorescent squares called pixels, whereas 
printing produces color images by applying dots of ink on paper. 
Creating colors by completely different physical processes causes a 
major difference between what you see on-screen and what you get in 
print.
With these points in mind, you should regularly print your artwork during the 
creation process to make sure that the printed result is as close as possible 
to what you’re designing on-screen. That way, you can modify your artwork 
to avoid surprises when you print the final product. After some practice, you 
develop an eye for what a printout will look like, even when you’re working 
entirely on-screen.
Setting Up Your Page to Print (You Hope)
Long ago in the Dark Ages, people slaved over drafting tables, among matte 
knives and ink bottles, struggling to create graphics while gagging on glue 
fumes. At last, at the dawn of the new millennium, computer systems forever 
replaced those ancient torture devices. These days, you can whip up a docu-
ment in Illustrator, feed pure white paper into a printer, and let ’er rip! (Uh, 
maybe I ought to rephrase that.)
Quick printing
Use the Document Setup dialog box (shown in Figure 15-2) to set up your 
page so that it prints properly. You can view the Document Setup dialog box 
by choosing that option from the File menu.
The easiest way to print is to choose File➪Print and press Enter (Return on a 
Mac) after the Print dialog box appears.

Changing Artboard size
 
 To change the size of your document, you can either click the Edit Artboards 
button in the Document Setup dialog box, or click the Artboard tool in the 
Tool panel. Doing either action makes your screen look decidedly unusual, as 
shown in Figure 15-3.

281
 Chapter 15: Printing Your Masterpiece
 
 
Figure 15-3: Adjusting page size in Illustrator is an unusually disturbing grayed-out experience.
Here, you can drag any of the handles along the edge of the page to adjust 
the size of the Artboard, or enter in values along the Control Panel (at the top 
of the work area) in the W and H fields, for width and height, respectively. 
When you’re done making changes, click any other tool in the Tools panel to 
be returned to the normal, healthy-looking Illustrator screen.
Printing Mechanics
After you make sure that your page size settings are correct (typically they’re 
fine unless — ahem — somebody mucks them up), you’re ready to commit 
your masterpiece to paper.

282
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Printing composite proofs
Printing a composite proof is really printing what you see on-screen to a 
single sheet of paper. You do this kind of printing all the time. If you have a 
color printer, your result looks really close (hopefully) to what’s on-screen. 
If you have a black-and-white printer, you get a black-and-white version of 
what’s on-screen.
The other kind of printing is called printing separations, which means generat-
ing a separate sheet of paper (or, more likely, film) for each ink to be used 
when the artwork is printed. I discuss separations in more detail in the sec-
tion “All about Way-Scary Separations” later in this chapter.
You can print composite proofs by following these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print from the menu.
 
 The Print dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-4.
 
 
Figure 15-4: The Print dialog box.

283
 Chapter 15: Printing Your Masterpiece
 
2. Select the appropriate printing options (as I detail in the next section 
“Important printing options”).
 
3. Click Print.
Important printing options
The Print dialog box has all sorts of options, but only a few of them are 
worth noticing. Fortunately, the default settings are usually what you want 
anyway — for example, one copy of whatever you send to the printer of your 
choice. However, for situations in which the current setting is not what you 
want, the following handy options are lurking in the Print dialog box:
 
✓ Name (Windows)/Printer (Mac): This drop-down menu near the top of 
the Print dialog box indicates the printer that you intend to use. If you 
have only one printer, this setting is most likely correct all the time. If 
you have more than one printer, you can see which one you’re currently 
using. You can change the printer setting here as well.
 
✓ Number of Copies (Windows)/Copies (Mac): This option shows the 
number of copies of your artwork that you want to print, each on a sepa-
rate sheet.
 
✓ Range: This option controls which Artboards (sure, they’re pages, but 
Illustrator is more sophisticated than that and calls them Artboards) 
will print. If you plan on printing all artboards, leave the All radio button 
selected.
All about Way-Scary Separations
Separations print a separate page for each color of ink that you use in a docu-
ment. Printing separations is a good way to double-check your work before 
you send it to a service bureau to be made into film or plates. If you never do 
that, skip this section.
 
If you do send your work to a service bureau to be made into film or plates, 
printing separations can save you a lot of time. For example, suppose you 
plan to print a job using black ink and the spot color Pantone 185. After print-
ing separations, you get pages for cyan, magenta, yellow, and Pantone 185, 
rather than just pages for black and Pantone 185. You know immediately that 
some of the colors you used were created as cyan, magenta, yellow, black 
(CMYK) process colors, not as spot colors. On closer examination of the 
pages, you see that the black type you used exists on all pages, and you know 
that the type was specified as Registration, not as Black. Registration and 
Black look identical on-screen, but Registration is a special color that’s used 

284
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
exclusively by printers (for those little marks that help center the content on 
the page). Registration is totally unsuitable for artwork. (Ack! No! Don’t print 
that ink drawing in Registration! You’ll only get a page full of gunk.)
I could fill a book with information about looking at separations to find out 
information about potential problems in your artwork. The book would be 
painfully long and boring, however, and one I don’t want to write. My advice: 
Print separations and leave it at that. Perhaps the best place to find out more 
about separations is your service bureau. The people there can help you 
examine your separations. In fact, many service bureaus require that you 
provide laser print separations when you place a print order so they know 
the file is properly prepared.
The concept behind printing separations from Illustrator is straightfor-
ward. Because printing in color requires different inks, which are applied to 
paper sequentially on a printing press, each ink gets its own printing plate. 
Illustrator generates film, paper, or even the individual plates themselves — 
one for each color of ink.
Traditionally, full-color artwork is printed using four different inks (and there-
fore four plates): cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CYMK). If you have a 
CMYK document in Illustrator, you’re working in the environment that’s per-
fect for full-color printing. Check out Figure 15-5 for a composite image and 
the four separations used to create it.
 
 
Figure 15-5: The original artwork (center) shown as four separations.

285
 Chapter 15: Printing Your Masterpiece
Separations are not in color
Separations don’t print in color; they print in black and white. It doesn’t 
matter to the printing press what color each plate is because the color is 
determined by the ink that’s used with a particular plate.
Printing separations
Okay, anybody except a jet pilot might find the Output section of the Print 
dialog box (shown in Figure 15-6) a bit intimidating. Don’t panic at the sight 
of that very strange list that appears, though. Instead, create the artwork that 
you want to separate. (Be sure to save any changes before you continue.) 
Then use the following steps to set up your document for separation printing.
 
 
Figure 15-6: Use the Output section of the Print dialog box for printing 
 
separations.
 
1. Choose File➪Print and click Output from the list on the left.
 
 The Output options in the Print dialog box appear.

286
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
2. Choose the Separations (Host-Based) option from the Mode drop-down 
menu.
 
 The ink check boxes become enabled.
 
3. Make sure that the settings (Emulsion, Image, and Printer Resolution) 
are correct.
 
 If you aren’t sure whether they’re correct, leave the default settings as 
they are and check with the representative from your offset printing 
company.
 
4. Click the icon to the left of any color that you want to print.
 
5. Click the Print button after you finish making changes.
By the way, if you need a quick refresher on the uses of CMYK and RGB (red, 
green, blue), sneak a peek at Chapter 1. I won’t tell a soul.

Moving Files Into and 
Out of Illustrator
In This Chapter
▶ Placing different files into an Illustrator document
▶ Managing linked files
▶ Exporting graphics from Illustrator
▶ Working with Photoshop files in Illustrator
A
lthough you can certainly take a file from concept to final printing using 
only Illustrator, you probably shouldn’t. It’s a specialized program, cre-
ated to be one small (but vitally important) part in a production cycle.
In a typical production cycle, text is created in a word-processing program 
(such as Microsoft Word), scanned images are edited in an image-editing pro-
gram (such as Photoshop), and vector-based graphics are created 
in Illustrator. Finally, all these elements are combined in a page 
layout program (such as Adobe InDesign) or a Web-design 
application (such as Adobe Dreamweaver).
Attempting to make Illustrator perform all aspects of 
the production cycle is like trying to build a house 
with only a hammer. Yeah, you could probably do 
it, but the task takes you a lot more time to com-
plete, the result looks really awful, and you’re a lot 
more tired and frustrated than if you’d used the 
right tools for the job in the first place.
Don’t get me wrong. Illustrator is a strong link in 
that production cycle. You can save Illustrator files 
in nearly three dozen different file formats! If you create 
something in Illustrator and save it properly, you can open 
your creation in just about any application that ever supported 
graphics on any platform — even bizarre and forgotten computer 
platforms, such as Amiga!

288
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
The bottom line is that Illustrator is designed to create files for use in other 
programs as well as to receive graphics files created in other programs. 
Harnessing the full power of Illustrator means making the program work well 
(and play nicely) with other programs — in other words, getting files into and 
out of Illustrator.
In this chapter, you find out how to make Illustrator play well with others by 
bringing files that weren’t created in Illustrator into your Illustrator docu-
ment and by moving Illustrator files into other applications.
Bringing Files Into Illustrator
You can bring graphics or text into Illustrator in several different ways, but 
the most straightforward, Joe-Friday way is to use the Place command from 
the File menu. Every type of graphic or text that can be inserted in Illustrator 
can be placed with this command, making it the one-stop location for all file 
importing. The “Getting Files Out of Illustrator” section (later in this chap-
ter) contains a list of the most common file formats that Illustrator can both 
export and import.
When you place artwork into Illustrator, you usually have the option of either 
embedding or linking the artwork. Each of these processes has different impli-
cations for file size and storage:
 
✓ Embedding: Makes the placed artwork part of the Illustrator file, even 
though the artwork was created elsewhere. That way, you need only the 
single Illustrator file for your artwork to print properly.
 
 Embedding can dramatically increase the file size.
 
✓ Linking: Creates a link in the Illustrator document to the placed artwork. 
The file size of the Illustrator document is smaller as a result, and any 
change to the linked file is automatically reflected in the Illustrator docu-
ment. Linking also enables the file to be updated outside of Illustrator 
(while maintaining the link). In order for linked files to print properly, 
both the Illustrator file and all linked files must be present.
To place a graphic in an Illustrator document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Place.
 
 The Place dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-1, from which you 
choose the file that you want to place.

289
 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
 
 
Figure 16-1: Select a document to embed or link with the Place 
 
dialog box.
 
2. Select the file that you want to place.
 
 If you don’t have any files lying around, look in the Sample Files folder 
(located in the Adobe Illustrator application folder) and pick one of 
those files.
 
3. Choose whether to link or to embed the file.
 
• To create a link between the file you want to place and the Illustrator 
file, make sure that the Link check box (lower left) is selected.
 
 Creating a link is the default setting.
 
 To embed the file you want to place in the Illustrator file, deselect 
(clear) the Link box.
 
4. Choose whether to use the graphic as an artistic element (the default) 
or a template.
 
 If you select the Template check box (lower left), Illustrator creates a 
special layer for the pixel-based image. (See Chapter 13 for more on 

290
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
layers.) This layer is locked (you can’t change anything on the layer); 
and the graphic is dimmed in the document after it is placed, making the 
graphic 50 percent lighter. Template layers also don’t print and aren’t 
included in the artwork when you use the Save for Web & Devices com-
mand. Template layers are especially useful when you plan to use the 
pixel-based image as a guide for tracing in Illustrator.
 
5. Choose to replace an already placed graphic or add the graphic 
as new.
 
 This check box option is available only after you place a graphic in the 
file and that graphic is selected. You have the option of replacing that 
graphic with the graphic that you’re about to place or bringing the new 
graphic in as a separate graphic. Just select the Replace check box to 
replace the selected graphic, or leave the check box clear to leave the 
selected graphic alone.
 
6. Click the Place button.
Deciding whether to link or embed
If you’re just playing around to see how the program works, it doesn’t matter 
whether you link or embed. If you’re working on a production with tight 
deadlines and making rapid changes to your document and money is on the 
line, I recommend that you link whenever possible. Linking makes the chore 
of changing placed images much easier.
When you embed something, it exists totally within a single Illustrator file: 
Your artwork is locked down. You can’t do anything to it other than move 
it, scale it (and other such transformations), or run a Photoshop filter/effect 
on it. That’s all, folks — and that isn’t much. You can’t edit your artwork in 
another application; because it’s embedded in Illustrator, it won’t respond to 
other applications. The term embedding is quite literal — it’s stuck in there. 
You can’t get your artwork out unless you pry it out with the Export com-
mand. (More on that in the section “Getting Files Out of Illustrator,” later in 
this chapter.)
Here’s an example. You send a completed job to your service bureau, but 
it can’t be printed because your five pixel-based images are embedded — 
two in RGB (red, green, blue) mode and the rest in CMYK (cyan, magenta, 
yellow, black). The images need to be in CMYK for the job to print properly. 
Illustrator can’t convert pixel data from RGB to CMYK. (Illustrator can only 
convert vector data.) You need to use Photoshop to convert the pixel images. 
If the images are linked, however, the folks at your service bureau can change 
them by opening the image in Photoshop, making the change, and then 
updating the link — a quick process that takes about a minute on a fast 
computer.

291
 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
Because the images are embedded, however, you have two options. You can 
deliver the original pixel-based graphics to the service bureau (assuming that 
your company has one, that you didn’t send the job over at the last minute, 
and that the service bureau is still open). Or you can rack up bad karma if 
you make the staff at the service bureau do this for you. This situation entails 
separating each image into its own layer in Illustrator, exporting the entire 
document as a Photoshop file; opening the document in Photoshop; deleting 
all the other layers; cropping the image to the right size; changing the color 
mode; saving the image; going back to Illustrator; and replacing the graphic. 
Whew! And this assumes that the service bureau staff actually knows how to 
do this, which not many people do.
 
If you know beyond a doubt that your images are perfect, pristine, and final, 
and never need changing in any way, you can embed them. If your feet touch 
the earth like the rest of ours do, link your images.
 
The only hassle that comes with linking is that you have to provide all the 
linked images with your Illustrator file whenever it leaves your computer 
because your file won’t print properly without them. This procedure is a 
minor hassle, however, considering the amount of hassle it saves!
Managing links
Whenever you place an image into Illustrator 
and link it, the image isn’t actually in your 
document — just like how Katie Couric isn’t 
actually in your house when you watch the 
news on TV. What you see in Illustrator is a 
preview of the file — an image of the image, 
so to speak. Think of the actual file as broad-
casting an image of itself to Illustrator while 
the file itself sits somewhere else on your 
hard drive. You look at the preview on-screen; 
and when the document prints, the actual file 
supplies the image for the document. If the 
actual file gets moved, modified, or deleted, 
you have a problem — especially if you’re 
printing — because Illustrator uses the pre-
view image instead of the real file. The pre-
view image in Illustrator contains just enough 
info to be displayed on-screen, but not nearly enough info to print with any 
quality. Fortunately, Illustrator provides you with a powerful tool to help 
you manage links: the Links panel. You can find the Links panel by choosing 
Window➪Links. What you get looks remarkably like Figure 16-2.
Relink
Go to Link Update Link
Edit Original
Figure 16-2: Use the Links panel for 
total link control.

292
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
The Links panel shows you all the placed images in your document; alerts 
you if anything is amiss; and enables you to update, edit, or replace the 
images — all with the click of a mouse.
 
The Links panel includes embedded images as well, even though they aren’t 
technically links.
To use the Links panel, you must first understand what the panel is telling 
you. The Links panel informs you about the status of the graphic through 
alerts. Alerts are tiny icons that appear beside the names of the graphics in 
the Links panel. They look a little like buttons, but they are strictly informa-
tive: Alerts warn you when a potential problem exists with the link. You can 
fix most problems by clicking the graphic within the Links panel, and then by 
clicking the Replace Link or Update Link buttons at the bottom of the panel 
(more on these options in just a second).
The alerts provide the following information:
 
✓ Embedded: The Embedded icon (a rectangle overlapping a triangle) 
indicates that the image data is completely contained within the 
Illustrator document and is not linked to an external file. This situa-
tion isn’t necessarily a problem, but it can be. See the earlier section, 
“Deciding whether to link or embed.” No “un-embed” button exists. The 
only way to turn this embedded image into a linked file is to click the 
Update Link button at the bottom of the panel, locate the original file on 
the hard drive, and replace the file with the Link option checked.
 
✓ Missing: A question mark inside a red octagon (or stop sign) shows 
that the actual image file is missing. This information is good to know 
because the linked image still shows up in Illustrator even if the infor-
mation that the file needs to print properly is missing. You can fix 
this image by clicking the Replace Link button. (More about this in a 
moment.)
 
✓ Modified: A triangle with an exclamation point (sort of like an emphatic 
yield sign) indicates that the actual linked image has been changed out-
side of Illustrator. This information is also vital because Illustrator still 
displays the original image.
 
✓ No icon: Everything is okay. Okay, so this isn’t really an alert. (Yeah, 
that would be pretty silly — Warning! Everything is normal!) Still, it’s 
worth noting that when nothing is wrong with a linked image, the panel 
shows just the filename of the image, its thumbnail, and nothing else.
After you identify the problems with the linked graphics, you can manage 
them by using the buttons along the bottom of the Links panel (refer to 

293
 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
Figure 16-2), by clicking the problem graphic in the Links panel, and then by 
clicking one of the following four buttons:
 
✓ Relink: This is the first button from the left. Click this button when your 
image is missing or when you want to swap the selected graphic with 
another graphic on your hard drive. After you click this button, the 
Place dialog box opens. Choose a different file or locate the missing file 
on your hard drive, and then click Place. The new image replaces the 
old one.
 
✓ Go to Link: Second from the left, this button is handy for locating and 
selecting linked graphics. Click the linked graphic in the Links panel and 
click the Go to Link button. This action selects the graphic in the docu-
ment as if you clicked it by using the Selection tool. Clicking this button 
also centers the view on the graphic, making the graphic easy to spot 
whenever you have a lot of other graphics in the document.
 
✓ Update Link: Click this third button whenever you see the Modified 
warning beside a link. This action updates the selected link with the 
latest information from the original file.
 
✓ Edit Original: This fourth button is available only for linked images — 
not for embedded images. After you click this option, the selected image 
opens in the original application that created it.
 
The Edit Original option is a great way to modify images. After you place a 
Photoshop image, for example, click this button to launch Photoshop and 
open the image. In Photoshop, you can make the necessary changes and then 
save your image. When you go back to Illustrator, it asks whether you want 
to update your modified image. Click OK to update the information.
Your goal, as you work with placed images, is to avoid all question marks and 
exclamation points in your Links panel. Fix these problems by using the but-
tons at the bottom of the panel.
The Links panel offers a few more tidbits through its pop-up menu to help 
you manage links. Click the triangle in the upper-right corner of the panel 
(refer to Figure 16-2) to access the Links panel pop-up menu. Here you find 
Replace, Go to Link, Update Link, and Edit Original commands that duplicate 
the functions of the buttons along the bottom. You also find various Sort 
commands, such as Sort by Name, which alphabetizes the linked images 
within the panel. You can also reorganize the panel by using Show com-
mands, such as Show Embedded, which hides all linked graphics. The Show 
and Sort commands are useful only when you have several linked images, 
which is rare in an Illustrator document. The two most useful things in the 
Links panel pop-up menu (shown in Figure 16-3) are the Embed Image and 
Information commands. Here’s how you use them:

294
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
✓ Embed Image: Click a linked image in the 
Links panel and choose the Embed Image 
command to embed the image into the 
Illustrator file.
 
✓ Information: Click an image in the Links 
panel and choose the Information command 
to open the Link Information dialog box. 
This dialog box is strictly informative. You 
can’t make any changes here, but you find 
out lots of information about the selected 
graphic, such as the image’s location on the 
hard drive, the image’s file size, the image’s 
file type, when the image was created, and 
a whole lot more. You can also access this 
dialog box by double-clicking the name of 
the link.
Getting Files Out of Illustrator
Files that are native to Illustrator (files saved in 
the Illustrator format within Illustrator) can’t be 
read by every application. However, these files 
are Portable Document Format (PDF)–based, so 
any application that can read PDFs generated 
by Acrobat 5 or a later version can also read 
Illustrator files. For the applications that can’t 
read Illustrator-native files, Illustrator can export 
a number of different file formats.
To decide which format to use, consider the 
eventual use of the file. For instance, if you’re posting your artwork on a 
Web page, you probably want to use either JPEG or GIF formats. (Find out 
more about these formats in Chapter 17.) If you want to place your file in a 
Microsoft Word document, you can use EPS, EMF, or BMP formats. (More on 
those formats in a moment.)
 
Typically, the manual that accompanies your software describes which file 
formats it accepts. Illustrator supports the export of 20 different formats 
(including variations of individual formats), so just choose a format that 
works in the target application from the list of available formats.
Figure 16-3: The Links panel 
pop-up menu.

295
 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
To export your artwork in a certain format, choose File➪Export from the 
File menu, choose the format you want from the Format list, and save the 
file. Some Export formats open an additional dialog box for that specific file 
format after you click Save. You’ll also find various file formats under the 
Save for Web & Devices command, such as PNG, GIF, and SVG as well as JPEG 
and SWF, which are also found under the Export command.
 
Not all file formats support vector-based data! (See Chapter 2 for details.) If 
you use EPS, PDF, Flash, or SVG, you preserve your paths; but most other for-
mats convert your Illustrator files to pixels.
The following list is a brief summary of the most useful file formats available 
in Illustrator:
 
✓ EPS: Encapsulated PostScript files are accepted by most software pack-
ages. Raster and vector-based data are preserved in EPS files.
 
 For more information about vector-based and pixel-based graphics, see 
Chapter 2.
 
✓ GIF: Graphics Interchange Format files are commonly used on the Web 
for files with few colors (good for solid-color logos and text).
 
✓ JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group files are highly compressible 
files that are used on the Web. They’re especially good for photographs.
 
✓ PNG: Portable Network Graphics files are the most flexible of the Web 
formats, providing support for compression and detail in a single file 
format.
 
✓ TIFF: Tagged Image File Format files are the industry standard for pixel-
based images for print work.
 
✓ PDF: Portable Document Format files are designed to keep the look and 
feel of the original artwork and can be read by anyone with a copy of the 
free Adobe Acrobat Reader (www.adobe.com).
 
✓ PICT: PICT files are the built-in Macintosh pixel format. Export any 
graphics to be viewed on Mac screens as PICT files.
 
✓ BMP: BMP files are the built-in pixel format of Windows. Use the BMP 
format to export any graphics that will be viewed on Windows screens.
 
✓ EMF: Enhanced MetaFile formatted files are perfect for embedding 
graphics in Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint.
 
✓ PSD: Photoshop Document files are native Photoshop files, which can 
contain Photoshop layer information.
 
✓ Flash: Flash files are a vector-based graphic format for the Web.
 
✓ SVG: Scaleable Vector Graphics files are the up-and-coming Web stan-
dard of vector-based graphic formats.

296
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
Whenever you export files, use the same name as the original document file 
but with a different extension (the two, three or four letters after a filename, 
traditionally required by Windows and DOS computers). These letters tell 
you the format of the file just by looking at its name.
Working with Illustrator and Photoshop
Illustrator and Photoshop, both from Adobe, provide unique and useful inte-
gration capabilities. You can take files from either application and put them 
directly into the other application in five ways: dragging and dropping; copy-
ing and pasting (almost identical to cutting and pasting); placing; exporting 
and importing; or opening. Each method produces slightly different results 
to meet your every need, whim, or desire. (Well, okay, just the desires that 
center on moving files between graphics applications. You have those all the 
time, right?)
Making life easy: Copy and paste, drag and drop
The copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop methods of getting a file from one 
program to the other are incredibly easy. Open a file in Photoshop, and then 
open a file in Illustrator. Make a selection in either program, choose Copy 
from the Edit menu, and then go to the other application and choose Paste 
from the Edit menu. Or simply click a selection in either program and drag 
the selection from that one application into an open window in the other 
application. In Illustrator, you can use any selection tool to do the dragging. 
In Photoshop, you need to use the Move tool.
After you move graphics this way, they appear at the height and width that 
they were when created in the other program. After you drag a graphic from 
Illustrator to Photoshop, the graphic rasterizes automatically. (Rasterize is a 
two-dollar word for the process that converts vector-based data into pixel-
based data.)
Whenever you copy and paste a graphic from 
Illustrator into Photoshop, the Paste dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 16-4. Choose from 
the four radio buttons there to select your past-
ing preference: Smart Object, Pixels, Paths, or 
Shape Layer.
Your first impulse might be to paste the graphic 
as paths. After all, Illustrator uses paths — not 
pixels — so you expect this method to preserve 
Figure 16-4: Pasting Illustrator 
data into Photoshop.

297
 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
your original Illustrator files as they are. Unfortunately, although Photoshop 
uses paths similar to Illustrator’s paths, they work very differently in Photo-
shop than they do in Illustrator. For example, paths in Photoshop can’t 
have strokes or fills, although paths can be used to fill or stroke an image in 
Photoshop and to do other important Photoshop-specific things. You just 
can’t use the path to print or display information on the Web.
Another option is to paste your graphics as a shape layer, which allows 
vector-based data to be retained without rasterization. In order to retain the 
vector-based data of shape layers, however, they must reside in a layered 
file, which limits your file formats to TIFF, PDF, or native PSD. Paste the 
Illustrator graphic as pixels if your end goal is to create and save a pixel-
based Photoshop image.
The best option tends to be Smart Object. This allows the pasted object 
to remember that it’s from Illustrator. If you double-click the object in 
Photoshop, you can edit it in Illustrator, paths and all. So while the illustra-
tor objects display in Photoshop as existing in pixel-space, there are really 
vector objects in there that can be changed.
Copying and pasting or dragging and dropping from Photoshop to Illustrator 
is easier than going from Illustrator to Photoshop (and that’s pretty darn 
easy). You don’t have to worry about the paths-to-pixels issue. Just make 
your selection and drag it by using the Move tool; or copy the image, go to an 
open Illustrator document, and paste the image. That’s it!
Don’t assume (even if it is quite logical) that because moving Illustrator files 
into Photoshop rasterizes the files, moving Photoshop files into Illustrator 
must “vectorize” them. This isn’t the case. The pixels in a Photoshop file 
stay pixels, subject to all the laws and limitations of pixels anywhere else. 
For example, Illustrator vector-based data prints out at the highest quality 
no matter how much you scale, skew, rotate, or distort the data. Pixel-based 
data within Illustrator starts to degrade (data gets blurry or worse) if you 
enlarge it or shrink it. Rotating, skewing, or distorting the pixel-based data 
has similar negative effects. Although you don’t have to worry about resolu-
tion for vector-based data, you do have to make sure that your pixel data has 
a high enough resolution: namely, 72 points (pt) per inch (ppi) for the Web 
and anywhere from 150 ppi to 300 ppi or higher for print.
When you drop or paste into Photoshop, the artwork appears inside a 
preview box, as shown in Figure 16-5. I cannot overstate the handiness 
of this preview box. While inside the preview box, the graphic isn’t really 
in Photoshop yet. You can position the graphic, rotate it, and then scale 
the preview. Then double-click inside the preview box (or press Enter for 
Windows, or Return for Mac), and Photoshop rasterizes the graphic at the 

298
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
best quality pos-
sible. If you rotate 
and scale the 
image after it’s 
been rasterized, 
you blur and oth-
erwise degrade 
the image.
 
Photoshop 
graphics that 
are dragged 
and dropped 
or copied and 
pasted into 
Illustrator files 
are always 
embedded.
Placing files
Placing files into Photoshop or Illustrator is one of the more versatile ways to 
bring data into the application. Each application provides a variety of options 
that aren’t available by using any other method.
Placing Illustrator files in Photoshop
To place an Illustrator file into Photoshop, open a Photoshop file and choose 
File➪Place. Select a saved Illustrator file (it doesn’t need to be open) from the 
Place dialog box and click OK. The file opens in Photoshop inside a preview 
box just like it does when pasting or dropping, which you can read about in 
earlier sections.
Placing Photoshop files in Illustrator
Placing Photoshop files into Illustrator is identical to placing any other 
graphic into Illustrator. See the section “Bringing Files Into Illustrator,” earlier 
in this chapter.
Now opening in an application near you
Native files can be read by the “opposite” application. In other words, 
Photoshop can read Illustrator files, and Illustrator can read Photoshop files. 
One advantage of this capability is that you don’t need to have any document 
already open.
Figure 16-5: The Place preview box in Photoshop.

299
 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
To open a Photoshop file in Illustrator, choose Open from the Illustrator File 
menu and select the Photoshop file. The Photoshop file opens in a new docu-
ment within Illustrator, in the color mode of the Photoshop file.
To open an Illustrator file in Photoshop, choose Open from the Photoshop 
File menu and select the Illustrator file. The Photoshop Import PDF dialog 
box appears, as shown in Figure 16-6. If you saved a file as an EPS or if you 
exported it in an Illustrator 10 or earlier format, this dialog box’s name is 
Rasterize Generic EPS Format. If you save the file in Illustrator CS format, this 
dialog box is Rasterize Generic PDF. Otherwise, these dialog box options are 
identical, no matter which name you see.
 
 
Figure 16-6: Use the Import PDF dialog box to refine your 
 
graphic settings.
In the Import PDF dialog box, you set the resolution and color mode of 
your graphic. Your exact settings should reflect, as closely as possible, the 
final purpose of the graphic. You should determine whether the graphic is 
going to be viewed on-screen (Web, multimedia) or if it’s going to be printed 
(desktop or offset). The more you alter these settings after you rasterize the 
graphic, the more you degrade it.
Exporting a graphic
Exporting is almost the opposite of placing. Instead of bringing a graphic into 
an application, you’re getting it out of an application. Exporting has two big 
advantages. First, you don’t need a copy of the other application to create 
the graphic in that format. Second, Illustrator layers export as separate 

300
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Photoshop layers, instead of as one flattened graphic. (Layers don’t stay 
intact when pasting, dragging, or placing an Illustrator file into Photoshop. 
See Chapter 13 for more info on Illustrator layers.) Sadly, Photoshop layers 
don’t export to layers in Illustrator although you can get Photoshop layers by 
using the Open command on a Photoshop file.
You can export any path that you create in Photoshop as an Illustrator file. 
To export paths from Photoshop, choose File➪Export➪Paths to Illustrator. 
The Export Paths dialog box opens from which you specify those paths to 
export. Select a path and click Save, and an Illustrator file is created that con-
tains your path.
Exporting from Illustrator is much more powerful than exporting from 
Photoshop because you can choose to export all your Illustrator layers as 
separate Photoshop layers. This option provides great versatility in case you 
want to further edit your graphics in Photoshop.
To export your Illustrator graphic 
as a Photoshop file, choose File➪
Export. Name the file in the Name 
field and choose Photoshop (PSD) 
as your format. After you click OK, 
the Photoshop Export Options dialog 
box appears, as shown in Figure 16-7.
In the Photoshop Export Options 
dialog box, you determine color 
model; resolution (for more on reso-
lution and which is best for what pur-
pose, see Chapter 2), anti-aliasing; 
and whether to export the graphic as 
a single, flattened layer or as multiple 
layers. Select the Write Layers radio 
button to export the Illustrator layers 
as Photoshop layers. If you instead 
opt for the Flat Image option, you 
export the file as a single, flattened 
layer. 
 
When in doubt, select the Write Layers option. You can easily delete or flat-
ten the layers in Photoshop (by using the Photoshop Layers panel) if you 
decide you don’t want them.
You also have the option of exporting your file with slices and image maps 
for use on the Web. For more on Illustrator and the Web, see Chapter 17. 
Also, you can export your image with compound shapes. When you bring 
compound shapes into Photoshop, they become editable clipping masks. 
Conversely, your Photoshop clipping masks become editable compound 
shapes when brought into Illustrator.

Export Options dialog box.

 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
Using Adobe Illustrator with Nearly 
Everything Else
Illustrator works great with Photoshop and InDesign. But what happens when 
you want to use Illustrator with other products? To make your Illustrator files 
compatible with as wide a range of applications as possible, you need to go 
with the standards. Standard file formats are the formats that the majority 
of applications can use. Whenever you save something using a standard file 
format, you’re almost guaranteed that anyone can open it, regardless of plat-
form or application, just as long as he or she is using an industry standard 
application, even if it isn’t one from Adobe, such as QuarkXPress.
For Web graphics, the standard formats are GIF, JPEG and Flash. As of this 
writing, PNG and SVG don’t have the universal acceptance needed to declare 
them standards. Keep an eye on them, however; times change fast. For more 
information on saving files in these formats, see Chapter 17.
For printing hard copy, the original 
standard format for vector-based 
graphics was EPS, but it’s now 
shifted to the more-flexible PDF. The 
Illustrator options for EPS appear in 
the EPS Format Options dialog box 
(see Figure 16-8). Virtually all page 
layout, word-processing, and graph-
ics applications accept EPS files. 
InDesign and QuarkXPress accept 
EPS files and work well with the file 
format.
Fortunately, saving EPS files is vastly 
simpler than saving for the Web. 
Choose File➪Save As, name the file 
there, and choose Illustrator EPS for 
the format. Click Save, and the EPS 
Format Options dialog box opens. 
(Refer to Figure 16-8.) Typically, run-
ning with the defaults (just click OK 
without changing any settings) works 
fine. In case you want something dif-
ferent, bone up on the other settings 
in this dialog box:
Figure 16-8: Set compatibility, preview, and 
other options in the EPS Format Options 
dialog box.

302
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
✓ Compatibility: You can open and edit Illustrator EPS files just like you 
do any other Illustrator files. Suppose a friend is helping out with a 
graphics project and doesn’t have the latest version of Illustrator. To 
give an EPS file to this person for editing, set the Compatibility option to 
match whatever earlier version your friend is using. Otherwise, leave the 
file set to the current version of Illustrator that you’re using.
 
 Saving your file to be compatible with an earlier version can alter your 
graphic. For example, Illustrator 3 doesn’t support gradients. If you used 
gradients, they get broken up into separate objects for every different 
color in the gradient. The graphic looks the same, but editing can be 
a problem. The fact that you can save files in the Illustrator 3 format 
is a testament to Illustrator’s compatibility with other applications. 
Illustrator 3 was outdated back in 1993! (That’s the computer equivalent 
of being fluent in ancient Greek.)
 
✓ Preview: Use these options to set how the Preview image displays 
when linked (Format) and whether the Preview image is transparent or 
opaque.
 
• Format: This option determines how you create the Preview 
image, which displays when the graphic is linked to a document 
in another application. Preview doesn’t affect how the image is 
printed — only how it displays on-screen. Choose the TIFF (8-bit 
Color) setting for Windows (which most Mac applications can 
read) or the Macintosh (8-bit Color) setting for Macs (which most 
Windows applications can read). However, if your PC has prob-
lems reading the Mac file, change your preview to the TIFF (8-bit 
color) setting.
 
• Transparent or Opaque: These radio button options exist only when 
you choose the TIFF (8-bit color) setting for your Preview image. 
Select one to determine how transparent areas in your graphic are 
handled. Typically, you want to set this to the Transparent option, 
but if you’re using the graphic in any Microsoft Office application, 
you need to select the Opaque option for full-compatibility.
 
✓ Include Linked Files: Select this check box to embed any linked files in 
your image.
 
✓ Include Document Thumbnails: In the Open dialog box of some appli-
cations, you get a thumbnail picture of the file, which lets you see the 
picture before you open the file. Select this check box to create one of 
those thumbnails.
 
✓ Include Document Fonts: Select this check box to build any fonts that 
you use in your document into the EPS file. Although selecting this 
option increases file size, it also ensures that your document displays 

303
 Chapter 16: Moving Files Into and Out of Illustrator
and prints properly if the fonts don’t exist on the computer used to open 
the file.
 
✓ CMYK PostScript: If you use any RGB colors in your document, this 
option enables them to print on a four-color, CMYK PostScript printer. 
This check box is a good one to select, just in case.
 
✓ PostScript: Choose levels here to set the PostScript level at which the 
file prints. PostScript is the language that printers use. You want to use 
the highest level that the printer is capable of. Today’s printers support 
Level 3, but these files don’t print properly on really old (pre-2000) print-
ers. If the file doesn’t print, try using a lower level. Be aware that lower 
levels can print more slowly and with less quality than Level 3. (But hey, 
that’s better than not printing at all!)
 
 If you save your file with Illustrator CS4 compatibility, you can’t save it 
with Level 1 PostScript. Export the file as an Illustrator 8 file (or an ear-
lier version) to change to Level 1.
 
✓ Transparency: This setting appears whenever you set the Compatibility 
option to any version prior to Illustrator 9. (Transparency was intro-
duced in Illustrator 9. See Chapter 10 for more info.) This feature enables 
you to make an object semitransparent so that an object beneath it 
shows through as a blend of the two objects. (Think of a semitranspar-
ent red circle overlapping a blue circle, making the overlapped portion 
appear purple.) Because this is an Illustrator 9 feature, earlier versions 
don’t support it. When you save an Illustrator CS4 file as Illustrator 8 or 
earlier, use a Transparency option to determine how to translate trans-
parent objects into something that earlier versions can understand.
 
 Choose from two radio buttons to either discard or flatten transparency: 
Preserve Paths and Preserve Appearance, respectively. The Preserve 
Paths option discards transparency altogether, keeping the same shapes 
that you originally created but making the graphic look very different. 
For example, a red and blue overlapping circle would look just like 
that, with no purple area where the two overlap. Select the Preserve 
Appearance option to create new shapes to maintain the look of the 
transparency. For instance, new paths are created for the purple area 
where the two circles overlapped. The Preserve Appearance option is 
almost always the way to go; it keeps your artwork looking exactly the 
way you created it.
 
If you use the Transparency option when you save an Illustrator document in 
an older format, you might get some strange and unexpected results. Save in 
the latest format (Illustrator CS4) if you can.

304
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
After you complete your settings, click OK. Your Illustrator file is saved as an 
EPS file, ready to use just about anywhere!
After you master saving your Illustrator artwork as an EPS, you can create 
graphics that are compatible with every major print publishing applica-
tion available. Saving graphics as GIFs or JPEGs (which I cover in Chapter 
17) enables you to make artwork that can be displayed in nearly every Web 
browser in existence. Add the ability to move files back and forth between 
Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as the many export options, and you can 
create graphics that work anywhere.

I
llustrator is the perfect tool for creating and designing graphical elements 
for Web pages. That statement might surprise you seeing as how most 
Web graphics are pixel-based, whereas Illustrator is a vector-based graph-
ics tool. In Illustrator, however, the big advantage to creating Web graphics 
is in the resolution independence of vector-based graphics (as I discuss in 
Chapter 1). You can create a graphic once, scale it to be any size you need 
it to be (even use it for print in addition to the Web), and it will always be a 
high-quality rendition of your creation.
In this chapter, you peer into the myriad ways of preparing 
Illustrator graphics for the Web and see how to deter-
mine the options that best meet the needs of individual 
graphics. You also find out about how vector-based 
file formats, such as Flash and SVG, help you put 
vector-based graphics on the Web while preserv-
ing the advantages of vector-based graphics (such 
as small file size and maximum quality, no matter 
at what size you view or print the graphics) in the 
process.
From Illustrator to the Web
When you create a graphic in a pixel-based program, such 
as Photoshop, you have to decide upfront how big you want the 
graphic. If you want to enlarge the graphic, you add pixels; if you want 

306
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
to make the graphic smaller, you throw away pixels. Either way, messing with 
the size means you end up with a blurry, lower-quality image like the zoomed-
in eye section of the otherwise incredibly handsome face on the left in Figure 
17-1. With Illustrator, though, you don’t have these problems. Even though 
you ultimately create pixel-based graphics, your graphics don’t become pixel-
based until you save or export them. You can save the Illustrator file many 
times at different sizes, and each one will be at the best possible quality!
 
 
Figure 17-1: Left: Standard size and resolution. Right: Zoomed in for lower resolution.
The differences between creating for the Web and creating for print happen 
when you save your graphic. Whenever you create artwork in Illustrator for 
the Web, you work like you always would. The key difference is in how you 
save your work after you create it. The only other difference that you might 
find is in the color choices whenever you create a graphic for the GIF file 
format. (More on that in a moment.) Otherwise, the creative processes for 
Web and print are identical.
Because you view Web graphics on-screen, you have a much better idea of 
how they will look after you put them on a Web site than you would if you 
were going to print them. Colors on-screen (and on the Web, which is always 
displayed on a screen) consist of red, green, and blue (RGB) pixel combina-
tions. So if you create graphics just for the Web, RGB documents are your 
best bet. If you create things for both screen and print, RGB gives you the 
greatest flexibility. (For more on RGB, see Chapter 1.)

307
 Chapter 17: Putting Your Art on the Web
Using Web colors only
Suppose you’re in a room full of Web designers, and you hear them talk 
about Web-safe color space and the Web panel. You look around discreetly. 
A dapper man in a dark suit steps out from behind the potted plant and tells 
you, “You’re traveling through another dimension . . .” and a weird piano riff 
starts to play.
Granted, Web design can seem pretty weird. At least the number of colors 
is relatively small. Web-safe color refers to a set of 216 colors that look the 
same in all Web browsers and on all computer platforms. If you’ve been 
creating for print for any length of time, you might be used to using an almost 
unlimited range of colors. Comparatively speaking, a mere 216 colors might 
seem limited at first, but there’s method in the madness.
One key benefit of the GIF file format is that you can specify exact colors to 
use in your artwork after the artwork is created. The catch is that you can 
only choose from the 256 colors that the GIF format supports. (Other modes, 
such as RGB support up to 16.7 million colors. Yikes!) So how do you get 216 
out of 256? Well, unfortunately, only 216 colors actually display the same on 
all Web browsers and computer platforms. That’s what makes them Web safe. 
So, what happens if you use a color outside of those 216? Whenever a com-
puter encounters a color it can’t display, it dithers the colors. The computer 
takes the colors that it can display and tries to emulate the missing color, 
putting alternating squares of the colors that it can display close together. If 
you look at the monitor from a distance and squint, you see a color that looks 
very similar to your original color.
Dithering is especially noticeable in large areas of solid color. The effects 
vary from computer to computer and browser to browser. Sometimes the 
effects aren’t noticeable at all. Sometimes you get an obvious plaid or striped 
pattern. Other times, you get plaids and stripes together (and that is such a 
fashion faux pas).
 
Bottom line: If it’s critical that your colors dis-
play consistently (and without dithering) to as 
many viewers as possible (as in the case of a 
corporate logo on a home page), use Web-safe 
colors. Use these Web-safe colors when you 
save your Illustrator graphic for the Web or 
when you first create your graphic in Illustrator. 
You can change the colors in your previ-
ously created Illustrator artwork by choosing 
File➪Save for Web & Devices. Or you can start 
out using Web-safe colors to build your artwork 
(which might save some hassle down the line) by choosing Window➪Swatch 
Libraries➪Web. Doing so gets you the Web color panel shown in Figure 17-2, 
home to the 216 Web-safe colors.
Figure 17-2: The Illustrator Web 
color panel.

308
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Just click any color in this panel and add it to your Swatches panel so that 
you can use it just as you do any other color. If you use colors only from this 
panel, you ensure that your artwork uses only Web-safe colors. However, 
many Illustrator features (such as blends, color filters, and transparencies) 
can quickly turn even these colors into unsafe colors. Illustrator likes mil-
lions and millions of colors . . . 
Don’t let all this talk of Web-safe colors make you gun-shy. In some situations, 
Web-safe colors are vital: in logos and large on-screen areas of solid color, for 
example. In other situations, though, they just don’t matter. Dithering is most 
obvious in large areas of solid color; if your graphic comprises many small 
parts, the dithering won’t really be noticeable.
 
 
Using the Save for Web command enables you to decide at any time whether 
to use Web-safe colors when you save your illustration. (See the section later 
in this chapter, “Creating Web-Specific Pixel Graphics.”)
Working in Pixel Preview mode
The majority of graphics created for the Web are pixel-based. The two 
most widely supported graphics file formats on the Web are JPEG and GIF, 
and these formats save only pixel data, not vector data. (See Chapter 2 for 
more on this crucial distinction.) When your graphics are in either of these 
formats, the majority of Internet users will be able to view your graphics. 
Fortunately, Illustrator can save graphics as both JPEGs and GIFs. Because 
pixel-based and vector-based images can look quite different, Illustrator 
has a special preview mode designed for when you’re creating graphics 
for the Web: Pixel Preview mode. In Pixel Preview mode, you can see what 
your vector artwork will look like when it’s turned into pixels for display on 
the Web. That way, you get a better idea of what the final artwork will look 
like on the Web (rather than waiting to be surprised when you see it in the 
browser for the first time).
To turn on Pixel Preview mode, choose View➪Pixel Preview. You might not 
notice anything different on-screen until you zoom in closer than 100%. Try 
200% to really see the pixel detail. Figure 17-3 shows Pixel Preview turned off 
and turned on at 200%.
This approach is much more convenient than using the File➪Save for Web & 
Devices command to convert your graphic into pixels to see how it will look, 
and then having to resave it if it looks awful. With Pixel Preview mode, you 
can edit the graphics “live” while you’re viewing the pixels.

Choosing a file format
Deciding what file format to use is almost as perplexing as picking between 
paper and plastic in the checkout line. Annoyingly, no single correct answer 
exists when you have to decide which file format to use for the Web. What 
works best for your purpose normally turns out to be a compromise between 
what you want and what you can have.
Well, okay, what can you have? You can choose from five file formats to put 
your graphics on the Web: GIF, JPEG, PNG, Flash (SWF), and SVG. The basic 
difference is in how each format presents your artwork. Consider this thumb-
nail comparison:
 
✓ GIF, JPEG, and PNG require that vector-based files be converted to 
pixel-based artwork. The results look sketchier but load faster since the 
files are compressed.
 
✓ Flash (SWF) and SVG preserve the paths you create in Illustrator even 
though sometimes they come with gigantic file sizes.
Each format has unique benefits and drawbacks. And here they come now.

Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
GIF file format
GIF is a great format for traditional Illustrator graphics — which means 
almost no gradients, blends, or fine details. GIF (Graphics Interchange 
Format) uses a maximum of 256 colors, but typically, you want to use even 
fewer. The fewer colors you use, the smaller your files.
GIF works best with simple graphics that have large areas of solid color. GIF 
compression encodes an area of solid color as if it were one big pixel. The 
more solid colors you have (almost regardless of how much on-screen area 
they cover), the smaller the file size. If you use gradients, soft drop shadows, 
or really complex graphics, you introduce more instructions into the file, and 
the file gets a lot bigger.
In the process of compressing all the different colors in your image (some-
times thousands or millions) down to 256 or fewer, you can get banding and 
dithering. Banding happens when a range of different colors gets compressed 
into one solid color and looks like a big stripe in your image where you didn’t 
intend to put one. Dithering is Illustrator’s way of simulating missing colors 
by putting tiny squares of the remaining colors close together, as shown in 
Figure 17-4. This type of dithering is separate from any additional dithering 
that happens when you don’t use Web-safe colors; see the previous section, 
“Using Web colors only.”
 
 
Figure 17-4: This image was saved with fewer colors, resulting in dithering.
GIF files differ from JPEG files in two important ways: GIFs can have transpar-
ent areas, and you can specify the exact colors you want (such as Web-safe 
colors) when you save the file.
 
GIF is one of the most widely recognized graphics formats for the Web. If you 
use a GIF file, you virtually guarantee that all your site’s visitors can open it 
in their browsers.

311
 Chapter 17: Putting Your Art on the Web
JPEG file format
JPEG is among the most widely recognized graphics formats for the Web. 
Anything that you save in JPEG format can be viewed by almost everyone. 
The JPEG format (created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group) provides 
the best compression possible for digitized photographs by throwing infor-
mation away. Don’t fret too much about this situation. JPEG does so intelli-
gently: examining the image and removing data where the human eye is least 
likely to notice the absence. What this amazing feat of mathematics means to 
you as an artist, however, is that your graphics files should start out with a 
lot of information — so that if you have to throw out a lot of the information, 
you still have a lot left. Unlike GIFs, JPEGs can’t have transparent areas and 
offer no way to specify exact colors.
 
Complex images with lots of gradients, blends, and soft shadows make 
good JPEGs. Alas, this format is really lousy for graphics that have big 
areas of solid color. You can’t hide the loss of information. Basically, if the 
image looks good as a GIF, it might look bad as a JPEG — and vice versa. 
Fortunately, you can decide which format works best by using the Save for 
Web command.
PNG file format
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format has a split personality — PNG-8 
and PNG-24. The graphics quality that you can get with simple GIFs is also 
available with PNG-8 graphics. PNG-24, on the other hand, is as adept at han-
dling complex images as JPEG. PNG-8 and PNG-24 files can have transparent 
areas. Also, PNG-24 compression is lossless, which means no reduction in 
image quality. Lossy compression actually has less detail, substituting pixels 
when it is shown on screen; lossless keeps each pixel intact and simply uses 
math for the compression.
Why don’t you just use PNG for everything? Well, first, PNG offers no way 
to control how much compression is applied to the image; you can’t make 
the image smaller (like you can with a JPEG). More importantly, PNG isn’t as 
universal as JPEG and GIF; you don’t see PNG format nearly as often on the 
Web. If you use this format, not all your visitors can view the graphic on their 
browsers. Some visitors with older browsers might need to install a special 
piece of software (a plug-in) so their browsers can read PNG graphics. This 
situation creates enough hassle that some visitors turn away from Web pages 
using PNG graphics to avoid downloading and installing the PNG plug-in.
 
If your primary concern is image quality, use PNG-24. If you want the maxi-
mum number of people to view your work on the Web and the maximum con-
trol over file size, use GIF or JPEG.

312
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Flash (SWF) file format
The Flash (or SWF) file format, created by Macromedia, is one of the cooler 
things that happened on the Web. Flash (now owned by Adobe) is the cur-
rent standard for vector graphics on the Web. Not only does it support 
vector-based graphics, but it also supports animation, sound, and interactiv-
ity. Of course (as per Murphy’s Law of Innovation), something so cool can’t 
be perfect, and Flash has its blemishes, too. Nearly every browser requires 
a plug-in to view a Flash file, which limits your audience from the start. Last, 
Flash files don’t play well with others. If you try to tie the Flash files into 
other non-Flash aspects of your Web site, you might run into difficulty.
SVG file format
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format was a proposed standard for vector 
graphics that has slowly been fading away since Adobe purchased Macromedia. 
Like with Flash graphics, most browsers need a plug-in to read SVG files.
So which file format is best, already?
Sorry, but I can’t tell you which file format is the best choice for you to use. 
That answer depends on what you need the file format to do and what trade-
offs you’re willing to live with. That’s the most practical answer for now. 
However, a summary can help ward off the Too-Many-Choices headache, so 
here goes:
 
✓ Maximum compatibility: Use GIFs and JPEGs if you want maximum com-
patibility with as many people as possible.
 
✓ Simplicity: Use GIFs for simple graphics with large, solid colors or for 
transparency.
 
✓ Complexity: Use JPEGs for more complex graphics with gradients and 
images and so forth.
 
✓ Maximum quality: Use PNG for maximum-quality complex graphics and 
transparency when compatibility isn’t an issue.
 
✓ Web considerations: Use Flash when you need to publish vector-based 
graphics on the Web and want as much compatibility as possible (but 
don’t require as much compatibility as with GIFs and JPEGs).
 
✓ La vida loca: Use SVG when you want as many bells and whistles as pos-
sible and are willing to throw compatibility to the wind.
If we’re all lucky, everyone will eventually adopt SVG as the standard, and 
we won’t have to worry about issues, such as which file format to use. (Of 
course, you gotta ask yourself: Do I feel lucky?) Until then, choosing the right 
file format is a juggling act that balances features, quality, and compatibility.

313
 Chapter 17: Putting Your Art on the Web
Creating Web-Specific Pixel Graphics
Most graphics on the Web are not vector-based but pixel-based because of 
compatibility issues due to different browser versions and different platforms 
(Mac, Windows, etc) out there. Regardless of which pixel format you use, 
Illustrator gives you the same dialog box from which to export your artwork. 
Choosing File➪Save for Web & Devices displays the Save for Web & Devices 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-5.
Even if the Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears a bit intimidating at 
first, it’s actually quite easy to use. Although you do have to wade through a lot 
of settings, the dialog box provides you with a preview of the image so you can 
see how the settings affect the image’s quality. The dialog box also gives you 
the file size and an estimate of how long the graphic will take to download — 
both important considerations when creating graphics for the Web.
The dialog box is slightly different, depending on the file format you’re working 
with, but the following few features remain consistent in any format you use:
 
Slice Select tool
 
Figure 17-5: Preview your image in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.
 
✓ Original, Optimized, 2-Up, 4-Up: These tabs let you view the image at 
different settings. Click the Original tab to view the image before any set-
tings are applied. Click the Optimized tab to see how the image will look 
after you save it with the current settings. Click the 2-Up and 4-Up tabs 

314
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
to see the image at multiple settings at once. These last views are the 
most useful. Your goal when saving your image, no matter what format 
you use, is always to come up with a version that resembles the original 
as closely as possible while maintaining the smallest file size (and lowest 
download time). The ability to compare the image at different settings 
with the original is vital to achieving this goal. To use the 2-Up and 4-Up 
settings, click either of the tabs. Then click one of the images to select it. 
Any settings you make apply only to that selected image. Click a differ-
ent image to apply different settings. Illustrator saves whatever image is 
selected (at whatever settings) after you click OK.
 
✓ File Size and Download Time: These features tell you how large your 
file is and how long that file will take to download over different connec-
tion types. This information is very important. Think of every second 
required for a graphic to download as another second the viewer has 
to get bored and click away from your page. Weigh this download time 
against the quality of the graphic and ask yourself whether having those 
extra colors, a little less banding, or a better-looking graphic is worth 
the download time.
 
✓ File Format: This drop-down menu is where you choose the format — 
GIF, JPEG, PNG-8, PNG-24, SWF, or SVG.
 
✓ The remainder of the settings: The remainder of the fields around the 
File Format menu deal with the file settings and the unique settings of 
that format. After you choose a format, the remainder of the settings 
change to match the features of that format. These settings are covered 
in depth under each file format in the next few sections of this chapter.
 
✓ Color Table: This tab shows you the exact colors used when you save 
the file in GIF or PNG-8 format. Here you can delete colors (or shift non-
Web-safe colors to Web-safe colors).
 
✓ Image Size: This tab lets you set the size (in pixels) of the image as you 
save it. This setting is the actual physical size of the image as it displays 
in the browser, not the file size.
 
✓ Layers: Illustrator allows you to export your file as Cascading Style 
Sheet (CSS) layers. An advanced feature, CSS layers, enables you to 
selectively hide or show layers on your Web page. They also allow for 
transparent overlapping slices. 
 
✓ Slices: The Slice Select tool, located below the hand on the left side of 
the Save for Web & Devices dialog box, enables you to select slices you 
made to your object in Illustrator. Slicing your artwork divides your art-
work into individual pieces allowing your file to load in sections on your 
Web page. Slices also enable you to assign features, such as rollovers 
and links, to individual slices.

 Chapter 17: Putting Your Art on the Web
Saving a graphic as a GIF file
To save your graphic as a GIF, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save for Web.
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. Select GIF from the File Format drop-down menu (refer to Figure 17-3).
 
3. Click the 2-Up or 4-Up tab at the top of the graphic.
 
 After you choose either 2-Up or 4-Up, the first graphic is your origi-
nal image and the second is selected as the Optimized image. As you 
change your file settings, this graphic updates to preview those changes. 
Clicking the third or fourth graphic (in 4-Up view) lets you make differ-
ent settings and simultaneously compare and contrast them to find the 
best settings. Adjust your settings to find the best balance of small file 
size and best image quality. Every setting you change affects both of 
those things. Watch the image carefully to see how the changes affect it.
 
4. Adjust the settings for the graphic, as shown in Figure 17-6:
 
• Color Reduction Algorithm: This delightfully descriptive setting (the 
drop-down menu beneath the File Format menu) simply means 
that you take the many colors in your image and reduce them to 
256 or fewer colors. How do you want to do that? Your choices are 
Perceptual, Selective, Adaptive, Web, or Custom. The first three 
are pretty much the same. The Perceptual setting makes the colors 
as close as possible to whatever colors the human eye perceives 
in the original image (so they say). The Selective setting does the 
same thing but uses as many Web-safe colors as possible. The 
Adaptive setting makes the remaining colors as mathematically 
close to the original as possible. The Web setting uses the closest 
Web-safe colors to the colors that are in the image. The Custom 
setting is for power users who want to create their own color-
reduction algorithms.
 
 Your choices are really between the Perceptual and Web settings. 
The Perceptual setting gives you an image as close as possible to 
your original creation. The Web setting gives you an image that 
looks the same no matter what computer or Web browser it’s on. 
Unfortunately, the Perceptual setting usually looks great, whereas 
the Web setting dithers things substantially. But look at the Web 
choice this way: This is as bad as the image is going to look. With 
any other setting, the graphic is going to look better or worse 
un predictably. With the Web setting, you know exactly how much 
dithering is going on, and nothing more will happen to the image — 
and the file size is definitely a little smaller.

316
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
• Dithering algorithm: This is the actual shape of the dithering pat-
tern. The No Dither setting won’t dither the image at all. The 
Diffusion setting randomizes the dithering pattern to make it less 
noticeable. The Pattern setting dithers in a fixed grid. The Noise 
setting is even more random than the Diffusion setting, making 
any dither even less noticeable. Sadly, the settings that produce 
the least noticeable dithering also create the highest file sizes. The 
Noise setting produces the largest files, and the Diffusion setting 
the second largest. The Pattern setting produces small files with 
noticeable stripes. The No Dither setting produces obvious bands of 
color in the image. Notice the weird curved shapes in Figure 17-6. A 
No Dither setting causes these to appear. Here again, your goal is to 
strike a balance between the smallest size and the best quality.
 
 
 Figure 17-6: Saving a GIF with a limited number of colors and the No Dither option enabled.
 
• Transparency: How do you want to treat the parts of your image 
that have no graphics? Do you want them to be transparent or 
filled with the Matte color (explained later in this list)? Check this 
box to make them transparent.
 
• Interlaced: This setting makes the file larger so that it seems to be 
downloading faster, which seems like a contradiction. When a graphic 
is interlaced, it first loads a very low-resolution version to the Web 
browser, and then the full-resolution version. Graphics seem to load 
faster, but the Interlaced setting is just soothing the user by showing 
something useful happening. Without interlacing, the whole page has 

317
 Chapter 17: Putting Your Art on the Web
to download before you can look at it. (The page actually loads faster 
this way; it only seems to take forever.) Impatient people may want to 
select this box (unless, of course, they already skipped this list).
 
• Lossy: This setting reduces file size by as much as 40 percent by 
eliminating pixels (at the expense of image quality). Use as much 
Lossy as you can get away with, but don’t ruin your image.
 
  The Lossy setting won’t work with the Interlacing setting turned on.
 
• Colors: This setting is the total number of colors used in the image. 
Sometimes, reducing the number results in a smaller image, but 
doing so doesn’t usually have as much effect as the Dither and 
Lossy settings.
 
• Dither: If you select the Pattern, Noise, or Diffusion settings for a 
dither method, you can use this setting to turn down the amount 
of dithering. Lower amounts result in smaller graphics with more 
noticeable dithering patterns.
 
• Matte: If you don’t choose the Transparency box, the Matte color fills 
areas of your image where there are no graphics. If you’re using trans-
parency and know what color you plan to use for the background 
of the Web page, you can set the Matte color to the background 
color, and the pixels at the edge of your graphic will blend with the 
background, creating a more visually appealing image. If you don’t 
know what the background color will be, set the Matte color to None. 
Otherwise, the edge pixels might blend to a different color from your 
background, producing an obvious fringe around the graphic as if it 
were snipped hastily out of a different background.
 
• Web Snap: If you aren’t using the Web setting for your color reduc-
tion algorithm, you can use the Web Snap setting to convert some 
of the colors (starting with those used most in the image) to 
Web-safe colors. This setting is a great way to achieve a balance 
between quality and compatibility. By changing just the largest 
areas of color to Web-safe colors, you can avoid the dithering 
problem in places where it will be most noticeable. The higher the 
setting, the more colors Illustrator converts to Web-safe colors.
 
 After you make your settings on several images and decide which image 
works best for you, click that image, and then click OK. The graphic 
saves as a GIF, ready for you to use on your Web page.
Saving a graphic as a JPEG file
In Illustrator, JPEGs are easier to make than GIFs. You need to worry about 
only one setting: Quality. Of course, quality can be specified in two ways. 
(Simplicity? Well, almost.)
To save your artwork as a JPEG, follow these steps:

318
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
1. Choose File➪Save for Web.
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose JPEG from the File Format drop-down menu.
 
3. Click the 2-Up or 4-Up tab at the top of the graphic.
 
 For more on viewing options, see the earlier section, “Saving a graphic 
as a GIF file.”
 
4. Choose a Quality setting.
 
 You can choose the Quality setting in two ways, but the effects are iden-
tical: by choosing it from the Quality drop-down menu, or by entering a 
number into the Quality field.
 
• The Quality drop-down menu: The menu offers you a choice of four 
preset values: Maximum, High, Medium, and Low. These options 
refer to the quality level of the image, not the amount of compres-
sion applied. A Maximum quality level produces (as you may 
expect) the largest file sizes and the highest-quality images.
 
• The Quality field: In this field, just to the right of the drop-down 
menu, you type in any value from 100 (maximum quality) to 0. 
Use the lowest Quality setting possible that doesn’t destroy your 
image. You might notice that the loss of quality in your image 
shows up as weird patterns that weren’t there before. These pat-
terns are especially noticeable where two large areas of different 
colors meet. Notice the weird horizontal and vertical bands (arti-
facting) in Figure 17-7. A little of this is tolerable in the name of 
smaller files, but too much becomes distracting.
 
 Note: Entering settings in the Quality field is identical to choosing values 
from the Quality drop-down menu. In the menu, the values of Maximum, 
High, Medium, and Low correspond (respectively) to settings of 80, 60, 
30, and 10 in the Quality field.
 
5. Adjust the other settings.
 
• Progressive: Like interlacing for GIFs, the Progressive setting cre-
ates the illusion that the image loads faster on Web browsers by 
loading a low-resolution version of the graphic first and then turn-
ing it into a higher-resolution image. In actuality, the image takes 
longer to load because Progressive files are larger, but viewers feel 
as though the download is going faster because they see things 
happening while they wait, rather than waiting for the whole down-
load before they see anything.
 
• Blur: Blur is a fairly useless setting. The goal is to reduce the 
artifacting in the image by blurring it. Unfortunately, the setting 
blurs the whole image, not just the artifacts, creating problems 
where none existed before. Leave this set to 0 (zero) and ignore it. 
(Unless, of course, you’re feeling a little misty.)

319
 Chapter 17: Putting Your Art on the Web
 
 
Figure 17-7: Saving a JPEG from the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.
 
• Matte: JPEGs can have no transparent areas, so wherever no graphic 
exists, Illustrator fills in with this color. A setting of None fills in with 
white.
Saving a graphic as a PNG-8 or PNG-24 file
The settings for PNG-8 are identical to those for GIF except you don’t get a 
Lossy option. (Read through the earlier section, “Saving a graphic as a GIF 
file.”) Put PNG-8 wherever you see GIF. No settings exist for PNG-24, except 
Transparency, Interlacing, and Matte options; what you get is what you get. 
Choose the PNG-24 file format, and the compression scheme does its thing. 
Either you like the result (and click OK), or you don’t (and choose GIF or 
JPEG instead).
Creating Web-Specific Vector Graphics
Vectors have several advantages over pixels. One of the chief advantages is 
their small file size, especially for basic graphics such as logos and buttons. 
Another advantage is their ability to be scaled without any loss of quality.

320
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
Saving a graphic as a Flash file
Flash is a very versatile format developed by Macromedia (which Adobe 
acquired, so it’s now Adobe Flash). Not only can you use Flash to show vector 
graphics on the Web, but you can also animate and add sound and interactiv-
ity to them. In Illustrator, you can create the graphic and do limited anima-
tion with it. Beyond that, you have to use another application (such as Adobe 
Flash or Adobe After Effects) to take full advantage of the format. For this 
reason, the Flash (SWF) setting in the Export dialog box is really intended to 
prepare artwork for export to one of these other applications, rather than to 
create artwork to go directly to the Web. Not that you can’t put a Flash file 
created in Illustrator directly on the Web. You certainly can, but then you’re 
tapping into just a fraction of what Flash can do.
Still, if you want your Illustrator artwork on the Web as vector data, Flash is the 
way to go. The one drawback to the format is the need for a browser plug-in in 
order for people to see your graphic in their browsers. This situation can make 
your graphic inaccessible to some people. However, Flash is such a popular 
format that most people have the plug-in installed in their browsers. Chances are 
quite good that many people will be able to see your work without problems.
If your primary concern is that your graphic appears on the Web with no-
holds-barred top quality (and print with the best possible quality to boot), 
use the Flash format.
To save a graphic in Flash format, just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box appears.
 
2. Specify a name, location, and file format for your document.
 
 In this case, choose Flash (SWF) from the file format drop-down menu.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The SWF Options dialog box appears.
 
4. After you complete all your settings, click OK to save your file in Flash 
format.
 
You can export Flash (SWF) files that include symbols. When opened in 
a Flash application, the symbols are included in the Symbol library of the 
 application.
Saving a graphic as a SVG file
SVG files, once heralded as the Next Big Thing by Adobe have faded away at 
this time, as Adobe focuses on supporting their Flash format. However, some 
mobile devices and most browsers with the required plug-ins support SVG. 
Here are the steps for saving a graphic as an SVG file:

321
 Chapter 17: Putting Your Art on the Web
 
1. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Save dialog box appears. The SVG file format can be saved directly 
rather than exported. You can also open an SVG file directly into 
Illustrator. And if that isn’t enough, Illustrator lets you open SVG files 
that were created in other SVG-savvy applications.
 
2. Choose SVG (SVG) from the Format drop-down menu. Specify a name 
and location for your document.
 
3. Click Save.
 
 The SVG Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-8.
 
 
Figure 17-8: Saving an SVG file with the SVG Options dialog box.
 
4. Establish your desired settings and click OK to save your file in SVG 
format.
Slicing and Dicing Your Graphics
If you’re an avid Web surfer, you’ve probably encountered a site or two 
where the graphics appear on-screen in separate chunks. In the Web world, 
these chunks are referred to as slices. 
 
 In Illustrator, slices can be applied to objects (vector- or pixel-based or text), 
groups of objects, or layers. And when any of these are edited, the slices are 
automatically updated. While Illustrator provides several methods for creating 
slices, the easiest is by dragging the Slice tool (found in the bottom half of the 
Tools panel) and dragging it around areas that you’d like to create slices out 
of. The on-screen result in Illustrator will look something like Figure 17-9.

322
Part IV: Practically Speaking: Type, Print, and Files 
 
 
Figure 17-9: Dragging the Slice tool around objects in your illustration results in an onscreen 
 
display of slices.
When you save via the Save for Web & Devices dialog box, the slices will be 
saved with your image.

f you can picture something, you can probably create it in Illustrator. The 
only trick is knowing how to create it. People who use Illustrator 
rely on thousands of little tricks to make their lives easier, 
make production faster, avoid unnecessary hassle and 
expense, and generally make their world a better place 
to live. Well, those thousands of tricks might not all fit 
in one book, but here are ten simple ways to jazz up 
your use of Illustrator.
Punching Holes
Take a close look at the two blue circles in Figure 
18-1. The hole in the center of the left circle is actu-
ally a white circle that obscures the background. In 
Illustrator, white is a color that is really “there” — and 
it blocks anything behind it. In the circle on the right, 
the hole in the center really is a hole, revealing the image 
behind it. 

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 
Figure 18-1: Use Compound Paths to create a “hole.”
How do you accomplish this remarkable feat? If you set the fill color for the 
white circle to None, just the little circle becomes transparent, revealing the 
blue circle behind it — so that won’t work. The trick is to use compound 
paths. The Compound Paths command joins two or more paths in such a 
way that wherever the paths overlap, you get a hole revealing whatever lurks 
behind the paths. Incidentally, this is how the holes in letters, such as O and 
P, are created so that when you run type over an object, you see the object 
through the holes.
All you need to create a compound path is two objects — one to serve as a 
cutting tool and the other to serve as a place to put the hole. Then follow 
these handy do-it-yourself steps (no safety goggles required):
 
1. Place the object that you’ll be using to make a hole in front of the 
object in which you want to cut the hole.
 
 In my example, the white circle is the cutter, and the blue circle is the 
cuttee.

327
 Chapter 18: Ten Production-Enhancing Tips
 
2. Select both objects with any selection tool.
 
3. Choose Object➪Compound Path➪Make.
 
 Where the paths overlap, you get a see-through area — you know, a 
hole.
 
To make the paths behave normally again, select the objects and choose 
Object➪Compound Path➪Release.
 
Perform the same feat by using the Pathfinder panel and choosing the 
Subtract from Shape Area command from the Shape Modes section. For 
more details, see Chapter 4.
Use Photoshop Effects in Illustrator!
Photoshop Effects (accessed at the bottom of the Effect menu) are always 
“live” in Illustrator, meaning that you can change them at any time. In addi-
tion, you can always change the attributes of your Illustrator artwork, 
making the artwork fully editable. If you were to take that same artwork into 
Photoshop, it would be difficult to maintain the same level of editability and 
scalability as you have in Illustrator.
When White Isn’t Nothing
Double negatives aside, here’s a little tip that can save you beaucoup bucks 
whenever you use gradients and spot colors in artwork you’re creating for 
print.
If you work with print publishing, you come to think of the color white as 
being nothing. In most of the familiar printing techniques, specifying the color 
white means don’t put down any ink (or toner, or dye, or any of the methods 
for putting color on paper) for anything colored white. White ink doesn’t 
exist except in rare situations (and no, correction fluid doesn’t count). The 
white that you see in print publications is just the white of the paper.
 
This approach depends on an actual, tangible piece of paper to provide the 
white for the image. To save yourself untold woe, don’t use the technique 
I describe here if your artwork is destined to live on the Web. It’s strictly a 
hard-copy issue.
Suppose you’re creating a two-color publication using black ink and a nice 
blue Pantone 9344 ink. The publication might be pretty dull in only two 

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
colors, but that’s all you have a budget for, so you decide to spice things up 
by using gradients. You create lovely gradients by blending Pantone 9344 
into white (assuming that white means no ink). Unfortunately, in terms of 
gradients, Illustrator thinks of a blend as a whole new CMYK (cyan, magenta, 
yellow, black) color (see Chapter 1), so the blend between white and a spot 
color (such as Pantone 9344) involves much more complicated instructions 
to the computer than you might have intended.
Sure, your graphics look perfect, but unbeknownst to you, your job has 
mutated from a two-color job to a five-color job. Usually, you discover this 
after your job is already at the printer, and then you have to pay hundreds of 
extra dollars for a mistake you didn’t even know you made.
The trick is to use the same Pantone color for all steps of the gradient (see 
Figure 18-2). Just follow these steps:
 
 
Figure 18-2: The same color is used at two different tint percentages, 
 
specified in the Color panel.
 
1. Choose Window➪Gradient.
 
 The Gradient panel appears.
 
2. Choose Window➪Swatch Libraries➪Pantone Coated (or another 
swatch library of your choice).
 
 The Pantone swatch library opens.

329
 Chapter 18: Ten Production-Enhancing Tips
 
3. Click the color of your choice in the Pantone library and drag the 
color from the Library onto a color stop in the Gradient panel.
 
 A color stop is the icon that looks like a little house; it represents a color 
in the gradient.
 
 Repeat this until all color stops in the Gradient panel are the same color. 
(See Chapter 10 for more information on gradients.)
 
 At this point, the gradient is one solid color. Not a gradient at all, really. 
But wait!
 
4. Double-click a color stop in the Gradient panel.
 
 The Color panel opens, showing the Pantone color set to 100%.
 
5. Set the tint of the Pantone color to 27%.
 
 This action gives you true, one-ink spot-color gradients that use the 
paper as “white” in that good old traditional way. See Chapter 10 for 
more info on gradients.
Expanding to Get to the Root of the Artwork
If you piled on the effects to some artwork, sometimes making adjustments 
to the end result is hard. If you’re absolutely sure that you’ll never need to 
go back and edit the original artwork, you can expand the artwork into “tra-
ditional” artwork that includes all the pieces necessary to create the appear-
ance you see on-screen.
To expand an object, follow these steps and examine Figure 18-3, which 
shows the original object with a gradient fill (top left) is expanded (bottom 
left) to 20 objects (with paths showing) and the final object (bottom right):
 
1. Select the object with any selection tool.
 
2. Choose Object➪Expand.
 
3. In the Expand dialog box that opens, choose to expand the fill, the 
stroke, and the object (if you selected an object blend) by selecting 
those check boxes.
 
 Select the Fill check box to expand the fill and simplify gradients. Select 
the Stroke box to create custom brushes, and select the Fill or Stroke 
box to create patterns — or just leave all three selected to cover all your 
bases. You can also specify what the gradient is expanded to: either a 
gradient mesh object or individual path objects.

Quick! Hide!
Simply hiding things can greatly improve your productivity in Illustrator. 
Otherwise, you might have a hard time seeing your current creation with all 
the floating panels and interface elements in the way.
You can hide all open panels and the Tools panel by pressing the Tab key 
(unless the Type tool is selected and a blinking I-beam cursor is on your 
page — then you just insert a Tab into your text). Press the Tab key again to 
bring everything back.
If you’re creating exclusively for the Web, hide the Artboard and the Page 
Tiling feature. These features show you the size of the page you’re printing 
to and the printable area on that page. This information is useless if you’re 
never going to print! Choose View➪Hide Artboard and View➪Hide Page Tiling 
to make them go away, respectively.
Have you ever made an object that contains so many points that after you 
select it you can’t tell what the object is anymore for all the highlighted 

331
 Chapter 18: Ten Production-Enhancing Tips
points and lines? You can hide these, too, while keeping the object selected. 
Choose View➪Hide Edges to make the highlights disappear.
You can hide everything you have open on your computer (including your 
desktop) except for the current Illustrator document by clicking the Full 
Screen Mode with Menu Bar button in the Tools panel. To hide everything 
including the Menu bar, click the Full Screen Mode button. (You can toggle 
through these modes by pressing the F key on your keyboard; this works for 
both PCs and Macs.) To get a completely unobscured view of your artwork, 
switch to the Full Screen Mode view and press the Tab key to hide your 
panels. Real power-users work this way, using keyboard shortcuts to access 
all the tools and menu items.
Taking a Tip from Illustrator
Illustrator offers ToolTips as a very helpful feature. Hover your cursor over a 
tool for a moment, and a little yellow box of text pops up telling you what the 
tool is. If the tool has a keyboard shortcut, that shortcut appears in parenthe-
ses after the name.
ToolTips, despite their name, don’t work with tools alone. (And they don’t 
give you tips — just the names of things. Go figure.) They work just about 
anywhere in Illustrator that you can position a cursor. Hover over a color 
swatch, and the ToolTip tells you the name of that color. Hover over a brush, 
and it tells you the name of the brush. Not sure what a cryptic icon in the 
Pathfinder panel means? Just let the ToolTip tell you.
ToolTips are invaluable whenever you’re using the program because there 
are just too many things to remember. With ToolTips, you don’t have to!
 
To toggle ToolTips off or on, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General and select 
(check) or clear (uncheck) the Show ToolTips check box.
Changing Your Units Whenever You Want
Do you feel that no matter what you do, your units of measure seem to be 
wrong? Are they always set to points, for example, when you really want 
inches? (Sometimes centimeters are easier to work with.) Fortunately, 
Illustrator lets you change your mind on the fly.
To see your measurement options, choose View➪Show Rulers and then 
right-click in Windows (Control-click on a Mac) any location on the rulers at 

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
the top and side of your screen. You get a drop-down menu that shows all 
the units of measurement that Illustrator understands. Choose the unit you 
desire; from that moment on, Illustrator uses that unit of measurement.
 
You can reposition rulers by clicking and dragging out from where the rulers 
meet at the upper-left corner. To reset them, double-click that corner.
However, you don’t have to change your unit of measurement to use a dif-
ferent one. In any field where you specify an amount (such as the Height and 
Width options in the Rectangle dialog box), just type in the amount you want, 
followed by the abbreviation of the unit of measurement that you want to 
use. If you don’t know the abbreviation, just use the whole name. Illustrator 
makes the conversions for you.
 
Want to impress your friends with a great power-user tip? You can cycle 
through the different measurement units by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+U 
(Ô+Option+Shift+U on a Mac). It helps to have your rulers up when 
doing this so you can see what the current measurement system is.
Reusing Your Brushes, Swatches, and Libraries
Has this ever happened to you? You go through the trouble to create custom 
brushes, beautiful colors, and outstanding appearances; save them in the 
Styles panel; and later discover that they’re all specific to the document that 
you created them in. Rats! To prevent that from happening to you again, you 
can open the swatches, brushes, and styles that you created in one docu-
ment in any other document.
For example, to get the brushes from another document, choose Window➪
Brush Libraries➪Other Library. In the Open dialog box that appears, choose 
the document with the brushes that you want to add to the current docu-
ment, as if you were going to open it. Click Open. Instead of opening that doc-
ument, Illustrator opens the custom brushes in their own panel, ready for you 
to use. Follow the same steps, choosing Window➪Swatch Libraries➪Other 
Library or Window➪Style Libraries➪Other Library to add your swatches or 
styles.
Avoiding Russian Dolls
Have you ever seen those cute Russian dolls? You know, the hollow doll that 
you open to find another smaller doll inside? And then you open that one to 
find an even smaller doll inside? And then you open that doll. . . .

333
 Chapter 18: Ten Production-Enhancing Tips
Illustrator enables you to create the digital equivalent of those Russian dolls. 
You place a Photoshop image into Illustrator, rotate the image, add text over 
the image, and save the whole thing as an Illustrator file. To add more, create 
a new document in Illustrator, placing the previously created Illustrator 
graphic (which also contains within it a Photoshop file) into the new docu-
ment by using the File➪Place command. You save this Photoshop file within 
an Illustrator file within another Illustrator file as an EPS file and place it 
within a page layout document. You have a Photoshop file now embedded 
four layers deep within the page layout document. (Dizzy yet?)
Although nothing prevents you from creating the digital equivalent of a 
Russian doll, editing the file is very difficult. A better method is to open 
Illustrator files and then copy and paste them into a document rather than 
placing them, especially if you want to do edits later on.
 
Subscribe to the KISS method: Keep It Simple, Silly Goose! Avoid going more 
than three places from the original file (such as a Photoshop file placed 
inside an Illustrator file, placed inside an InDesign document, with scaling 
happening in only one of those places). Two places are even better if you can 
limit yourself. If you need to bring Illustrator data from one Illustrator docu-
ment to another, open both documents and copy and paste the info rather 
than place it.
Selecting Type When You Want
If you work with type and objects, you might discover how annoying it is 
to select an object that’s lurking behind type. Even when you click where 
there’s obviously no type, you still select the type instead of the object 
behind it. This happens because one of Illustrator’s most annoying features is 
turned on. The Type Area Select feature automatically selects type when you 
click anywhere in its area — not just when you click directly on the type or 
its path.
Turn off this (ahem) feature by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Type & Auto 
Tracing. In the Type & Auto Tracing Preferences dialog box, remove the 
check mark from the Type Area Select check box. Click OK. Breathe easier. 
Henceforth, type shall be selected whenever you click directly on a letter or 
on its path, and at no other time, by royal proclamation of the user.

Ten (Or So) Ways to Customize 
Illustrator
In This Chapter
▶ Telling panels where to go
▶ Setting up custom keyboard shortcuts
▶ Getting easier access to tools
▶ Changing the start-up documents
▶ Tweaking the default settings
▶ Editing preferences
▶ Creating Actions
K
eyboard commands are great shortcuts — you gotta love ’em, finger 
cramps and all — but what if you could make them easier to use? Or 
maybe you have some styles that you use all the time and you want 
them to be (gasp) available all the time. And how about that 
quirky default page size that each new document shows 
up wearing? Well, if you itch to tinker, adjust, and fine-
tune (but you misplaced your ball-peen hammer), you 
came to the right place. This chapter shows you how to 
adjust, redefine, and yes, customize the way Illustrator 
works for you.
 
Before you go on a feature-tweaking rampage, consider 
this: You’re changing how Illustrator works globally. 
So a word to the wise: Read first. Then, if you like 
what you see, make a change and try it out for a while 
before you change anything else. Return to default 
settings if you make a mistake.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Positioning Panels
Illustrator saves all panel positions just as they were when you quit Illustrator. 
The next time you use Illustrator, the panels appear right where you left 
them. This structure is handy most of the time, but your panels can get a bit 
disorganized if you move them all over the place while chasing a creative 
inspiration. If you want to get them back to Square One with no fuss, read on.
You can save a set or sets of panel positions for later use by saving a 
Workspace, located at Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace. Whenever you 
need to reset the panels to their convenient locations, just choose the work-
space from the Window➪Workspace list. If you’d like to get back to the origi-
nal Illustrator “factory settings,” choose Window➪Workspace➪Essentials.
The Flexible Tools Panel
Give each tool in the Tools panel its own keyboard shortcut. For example, 
pressing the V key brings up the Selection tool, and pressing the Z key brings 
up the Zoom tool.
 
To change the keyboard shortcut for a tool (or to add shortcuts for tools 
that don’t have any), choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts. In the Keyboard 
Shortcuts dialog box, shown in Figure 19-1, choose Tools from the drop-down 
menu at the top left of the dialog box (if it’s not already selected), find the 
tool you want to change (or add), and then highlight the current command. 
Type a new shortcut and then click OK to make the new shortcut available.
 
 
Figure 19-1: Use the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box to customize tool commands.

337
 Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Ways to Customize Illustrator
If the shortcut has been assigned to another command, you’ll see a warning 
message that there’s a conflict, what the conflict is, and you’ll have the ability 
to undo your proposed change at that time.
Changing the Items on the Menu
You can customize keyboard shortcuts to all Illustrator menu commands 
by using the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box (refer to Figure 18-1). Go to this 
dialog box by choosing Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts.
You can redefine even the most common commands, such as Open and New, 
with different keyboard shortcuts. To add a new keyboard shortcut, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts.
 
 The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box opens.
 
2. Choose Menu Commands from the drop-down menu at the top left of 
the dialog box (the default name is Tools).
 
 A list of all Illustrator menus appears. Click the arrow beside the menu 
name to open the complete list of items under that menu. If the item 
already has a keyboard shortcut, you find it listed to the right of the 
menu item, in the Shortcut column.
 
3. Change the keyboard shortcuts by highlighting the current keyboard 
shortcut, typing a new shortcut, and pressing Enter.
 
 If the item has no keyboard shortcut assigned to it, you can give it one. 
To highlight the empty space, click in the Shortcut column (to the right 
of the menu item) and type in your shortcut there.
You can also print out a big sheet of all the keyboard shortcuts, even if you 
haven’t changed any of them. To print out all the keyboard shortcuts, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts.
 
 The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box opens.
 
2. Click the Export Text button at the middle right of the Keyboard 
Shortcuts dialog box.
 
 A Save dialog box opens.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Name the text file that you want to contain your keyboard shortcuts, 
specify a location for it on your hard drive, and then click OK to save 
the text file.
 
4. Open any word processing program on your computer, choose 
File➪Open, open the text file you just created, and print it.
 
You can always return to the original keyboard commands by choosing 
Illustrator Defaults from the Set drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of 
the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box.
Changing the Default Settings
You can change how the entire Illustrator application works. Assuming 
that you have a plan (handy to have at a time like this), choose Illustrator 
(icon)➪Preferences➪General (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences➪General (Windows). 
Behold: The Preferences dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-2, with 
the General settings already displayed for you.
 
 
Figure 19-2: Set preferences here.
The General tab of the Preferences dialog box is just the first of several 
Preferences tabs containing a multitude of options for you to change. Each 
change affects how that the application works, and Illustrator saves these 
changes when you quit the program, regardless of the documents that you’re 
working in.

339
 Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Ways to Customize Illustrator
 
Don’t start changing preference settings all helter-skelter when you first 
stumble across this dialog box. Doing so might cause unexpected behaviors 
in the application, such as Illustrator printing your letterhead in hieroglyph-
ics. A better idea is to look at the list of items and change only one at a time, 
testing each item after you change it, even writing down what you did so you 
can remember the changes. If the results of a change aren’t up to snuff, then 
be sure to change the preference back to its original setting.
Changing Hidden Commands 
You Never Knew About
In addition to those nice, respectable, visible menu commands and tool 
shortcuts, all sorts of nifty shortcuts just hang around in Illustrator without 
a single menu item or tool associated with them. These shortcuts are handy 
commands, such as Increase Type Size: Ctrl+Shift (Windows)/Ô+Shift (Mac). 
Even better, every one of these commands can be customized. Simply scroll 
through the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box to find every command that 
exists in Illustrator. (Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts to get there.) If you 
find one that looks as though it might prove useful, give it a new shortcut. 
Figure 19-3 shows some keyboard commands you might not have known 
about that you can change easily.

Action Jackson
Have you ever found yourself doing 
things again and again (such as 
typing the word redundant dozens of 
times)? Have you ever wished that 
your computer could do some of this 
tedious work for you? Well, that’s 
where Actions come in. Actions 
make Illustrator do the grunt work 
while you get to do all the fun stuff.
Illustrator comes with hundreds of 
Actions although only a dozen are 
installed with the software. You 
can find the rest on your Illustrator 
application CD-ROM, which you’ll 
have to insert and copy after you 
install. Better yet, you can make 
your own Actions! Actions can be 
virtually any series of Illustrator 
activities, such as scaling, rotating, 
changing colors, or bringing selec-
tions to the front. You can even use 
Actions to select objects if they have 
specific names.
 
One of the handiest uses for Actions 
is creating compound keyboard 
shortcuts. For example, you can per-
form a set of procedures at the same 
time — such as Create New Layer, 
Place, and Scale — without even 
wrenching your wrist. Instead of 
performing all three keyboard com-
mands individually, you can easily 
set up an Action to do all three 
simultaneously. Result: One key-
board command does three tasks! 
You just smile and watch. Choose 
Window➪Actions, and meet the 
friendly Actions panel in Figure 19-4.
To use any Action, click it in the 
Actions panel and then click the 
Play Current Selection
Create New Action button
Figure 19-4: The Actions panel puts power at 
your virtual fingertips.

341
 Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Ways to Customize Illustrator
Play Current Selection button (the right-pointing arrow) at the bottom of the 
panel.
Creating your own Action feels something like taping your voice or image and 
then playing it back. When you record an Action, Illustrator watches what 
you do and records every step as closely as possible. (This procedure is a lot 
like creating a macro in Word.)
 
Computers have no imagination; you have to tell them exactly what to 
do. Therefore, your recorded Actions must use precise values. Anything 
that requires a level of human interaction does not get recorded. In effect, 
Illustrator says, “That’s not my department. So there.” For example, creating 
a one-inch rectangle is a precise action. Drawing a squiggly line is not. You 
can’t always know in advance whether Illustrator can record all the actions 
you perform — but you know for certain after you play it back. Hey, it’s not a 
program; it’s an adventure.
To create your own Action, just follow these steps:
 
1. Open a new document in Illustrator and choose Window➪Actions.
 
 The Actions panel opens.
 
2. Click the Create New Action button.
 
 The New Action dialog box opens.
 
3. Name the Action, click OK to close the New Action dialog box and 
then click the Record button on the Actions Panel.
 
 For example, type the name Red Rectangle for the Action. After you 
click the Record button, the Action records everything you do, tapping 
your phone, and transmitting that information back to Adobe where 
they’re keeping a file on you. Just kidding. Honest.
 
4. Perform a series of actions with the keyboard or the mouse.
 
 For the example, select the Rectangle tool and drag out a rectangle in 
the document. Then choose a red swatch from the Swatches panel for 
the Fill color.
 
5. Click the Stop Playing/Recording button.
 
 The Action shows up on the Actions panel, ready for, um, action. Great 
gung-ho attitude, eh? But hold on a minute. . . .
 
6. Prepare to test your Action.
 
 In this case, delete your original rectangle. This finishing touch pre-
vents the Action from creating another rectangle of the exact same size, 
shape, color, and position.

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
7. Test your Action by clicking the name of the Action and then clicking 
the Play Current Selection button.
 
 If the Action does exactly what you planned, it’s ready for duty.
 
The preceding example is a simple Action. With a bit of practice, you can 
create infinitely more complex Actions. This wonder results from a simple 
fact: An Action records (nearly) everything you do from the time you start 
recording to the time you click Stop. The Action can be a simple menu com-
mand or something as complex as the creation of some amazing artwork, as if 
by magic.
Sticky Settings
Some of the things that you do in Illustrator remain “sticky” until you quit 
the application. For example, if you create a rectangle that’s 1 x 2 inches, the 
next time you click with the Rectangle tool, the values are automatically set 
to 1 x 2 inches. All the dialog boxes in Illustrator remember what you did last 
during your current Illustrator session. (But don’t worry; they won’t tell a 
soul.)
 
Between sessions, the entries in the Preferences dialog box and the positions 
of the panels are all that remain constant. Oh, well. At least something does.
