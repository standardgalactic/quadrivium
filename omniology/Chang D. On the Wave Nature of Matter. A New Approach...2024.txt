Preface 
What is this book about? This book is to introduce a new approach for explaining 
the foundation of quantum physics and to resolve the conﬂict between quantum 
mechanics and relativity. At present, there are many deep questions in modern physics 
that have not been satisfactorily resolved. For example,
• What is the physical basis of wave-particle duality? The quantum particle is 
supposed to behave like a point mass, why does it sometimes behave like a wave?
• What is the origin of matter? How can particles be created in the vacuum? How 
can energy be converted into mass?
• What is the meaning of matter wave? The movement of quantum particles 
can be described accurately using the quantum wave equations (e.g., Schrödinger 
equation). However, it is not clear what is the physical meaning of the quantum 
wave function. Does it represent a physical wave or a wave of probability?
• What is the physical meaning of mass? Could a photon have mass? Why does 
the moving mass of a particle change with speed?
• How to resolve the conﬂict between quantum physics and relativity? What is 
the physical property of the vacuum? Is the vacuum empty? There is a serious 
conﬂict on the view of the vacuum between quantum mechanics and relativity. 
The vacuum in quantum mechanics is not empty; it is just the ground state of 
the quantum system. However, the vacuum in special relativity must be an empty 
space; otherwise, the vacuum will provide a universal reference frame to tell which 
inertial frame is stationary and which one is in motion. 
To resolve these deep questions, one needs to take a brave new approach that 
is fundamentally different from the conventional thinking. In the past one hundred 
years, physicists have been using a “particle” approach to explain the quantum world. 
In this traditional view, our material world is made up of point-like particles called 
“fermions”. This “particle” view, however, has great difﬁculty in explaining the

observation of wave-particle duality. How can a quantum particle (such as an electron 
or neutron) behave like a light wave in a diffraction experiment (or in a double-
slit experiment)? Furthermore, how can a point-mass-like particle be created from 
nowhere or annihilated in the vacuum? 
These observations give us a hint: Could the quantum particle be a quantized 
excitation wave, just like the photon? This hint stimulated us to think: Can this 
wave approach help us to overcome the previous difﬁculties? Could one use a wave 
hypothesis to resolve some of the outstanding questions encountered in modern 
physics? Over the past decade, we have conducted a series of investigations to explore 
this possibility. The results have been highly encouraging. 
This book is a comprehensive review of our work in using the wave approach 
to understand the foundation of quantum physics. Our hypothesis is called the 
“Quantum Wave Model”, in which we propose that the vacuum is a dielectric medium 
according to the Maxwell theory, and the quantum particles are quantized excitation 
waves of the vacuum medium. Thus, matter in our universe is really made of waves. 
Based on this idea, one can easily explain the physical basis of wave-particle 
duality. At the microscopic level, the quantum particle is a wave; but at the macro-
scopic level, the wave packet behaves like a particle. Using this model, the known 
quantum wave equations, including the Klein-Gordon equation, the Dirac equation, 
and the Schrödinger equation can be directly derived based on vacuum excitation. 
Furthermore, this model provides a clear physical meaning of energy, momentum, 
and mass based on the geometrical properties of the vacuum. Some well-known 
“relativistic effects” can also emerge naturally from this model. Thus, this model can 
provide a comprehensive explanation for most of the existing mysteries in quantum 
physics. 
The model discussed in this book is not a theory of everything. However, it can 
provide useful hints for the future studies of particle physics or cosmology. The 
ﬁnal part of this book (Part VI) is an in-depth discussion of the open questions and 
remaining challenges in this regard. 
This book is written for people curious in science. Its purpose is to provide a big 
picture view. It discusses the foundations of quantum theory and relativity in a way 
that undergraduate physics students and advanced research physicists can understand. 
The focus of this book is on physical concepts and logical thinking. Readers do not 
need advanced mathematical training to enjoy this book. 
This book is written on a semi-technical level. Some of the more technical discus-
sions are presented in the Appendix. For readers who are not mathematically inclined, 
they can skip reading the derivation of equations. The results of most mathematical 
derivation are summarized in the Chapter Summary given at the end of each chapter.

Chapter 1 
Introduction: The Particle World Versus 
the Wave World 
Our material world is basically composed of matter and radiation. According to 
the current quantum theory, both matter and radiation are made up of “particles”. 
These particles are quantum objects, which behave in a very strange way. In clas-
sical physics, a particle is a corpuscular object (a rigid point mass); it behaves like 
a tiny billiard ball. The quantum particle, however, behaves very differently from 
the classical particle. It behaves as both a corpuscular object and a wave (e.g., 
“matter wave”). Over the past one hundred years, physicists have developed a highly 
successful theory called “quantum mechanics” to describe the interactions between 
these quantum particles (e.g., electrons and photons). However, they cannot explain 
why the quantum particle behaves differently from the classical particles. This has 
become a big mystery. 
Philosophically speaking, a physical object might be viewed as a particle or a 
wave. For example, several hundred years ago, Newton and Huygens had an active 
debate on the physical nature of light; they showed that the behavior of light can 
be explained either based on a particle perspective or on a wave perspective. In the 
nineteenth century, it was clearly demonstrated that light is an electromagnetic wave. 
But at the beginning of the twentieth century, it was shown by Planck and Einstein 
that light can also be considered as a stream of particles (called “photon”). This 
strange property of light is called “wave-particle duality”. 
Even more interestingly, it was discovered later that not only massless particles 
such as photons can exhibit the property of wave-particle duality; massive particles 
(such as electrons or neutrons) can also exhibit both corpuscular and wave properties. 
This new understanding was ﬁrst proposed by de Broglie and later veriﬁed in a series 
of diffraction experiments [1–3]. Nowadays, many physical events at the atomic level 
are found to be associated with wave behavior [4–9]. 
In view of the discovery of wave-particle duality, one could interpret the quantum 
world from a particle view or from a wave view. But historically, the development of 
quantum physics was mainly based on the particle view. In fact, such an approach has 
achieved great success in the past one hundred years. However, the particle theory of

quantum physics also encountered some major conceptual challenges, which even 
the most brilliant physicists do not see any way out. (For details, see below.) In this 
book, we would like to explore a new approach by interpreting the quantum world 
from a wave point of view. We found this new approach can indeed overcome some 
of the major conceptual limitations of the current quantum theory. The objective of 
this book is to give a detailed explanation on how one can use the wave model 
to resolve the quantum mysteries encountered today. 
1.1 
The Current Quantum Theory is a Particle Theory 
In the quantum physics theory used today, it is basically taking a particle view. Most 
physicists regard the quantum system as a mechanical system composed of particles, 
each of which behaves like a point mass. For example, we know the building blocks 
of matter are atoms. In most textbooks, an atom is depicted as a miniature solar 
system (see Fig. 1.1), where electrons move around the nucleus like tiny planets. In 
this picture, not only the nucleus is viewed as a tiny massive particle, each electron 
is also regarded as a corpuscular object. 
Today, the branch of physics that studies the interaction between sub-atomic 
particles is called “particle physics”. Its mainstream theory, the so-called “Stan-
dard Model”, proposes that all matters in the world are made of a sub-set of particles 
called “fermions”, and the interacting forces between these fermions are carried by 
another sub-set of particles called “bosons”. For example, the atom is made up of 
protons, neutrons, and electrons, which are fermions. The particle carrying electro-
magnetic interactions is supposed to be the photon, which is a boson. In fact, the 
force-mediating bosons could be very massive. For example, the particles carrying 
the weak force (W± and Z particles) and the particles carrying the strong force 
(gluons) are very heavy particles.

where electrons move around the nucleus like tiny planets. In this picture, each electron is regarded 
as a corpuscular object

What is the Problem with the Current View 
of Quantum Physics? Why Do We Need a Paradigm 
Shift? 
The quantum theory used today is generally referred to as the “quantum ﬁeld theory”, 
which is a combination of quantum mechanics, special relativity, and the classical 
ﬁeld theory. Quantum mechanics, of course, is a highly successful theory. It provides 
the basis for the development of many branches of modern physics, including atomic 
physics, molecular physics, condensed matter physics, etc. In fact, most of the modern 
technology we use today, including all electronic devices, computers, mobile phones, 
and communication networks, all depends on quantum mechanics and quantum 
electrodynamics. 
Then, why are we not satisﬁed with it? 
That is because there are serious fundamental problems with the current version 
of quantum theory. These problems include: 
(1) After more than one hundred years of development, the physical foundation of 
quantum mechanics is still not well understood; it remains a deep mystery. 
(2) There is a serious conﬂict between the fundamental assumptions of quantum 
mechanics and that of relativity. 
(3) There are still many unanswered fundamental questions in the current quantum 
theory. It is not clear that the current model can take us to a deeper understanding 
of our physical world. 
In the following, let us review these problems one by one. 
1.2.1 
Lack of Understanding on the Physical Basis 
of Quantum Mechanics 
Today, there is still a lot of mystery in quantum mechanics. First, the current theory 
cannot explain why a quantum particle has both corpuscular and wave properties 
(wave-particle duality). Second, unlike the equations of motion in classical physics, 
which are based on well-established physical laws, the derivations of quantum wave 
equations (the Schrödinger equation and the Dirac equation) were based mainly on 
conjectures; the strongest justiﬁcation is that these wave equations can lead to results 
consistent with experiments [6, 10–12]. This is not very satisfactory. In the physics 
tradition, we always want to know the physical basis behind a working theory. 
Finally, there is serious confusion about the physical meaning of the quantum 
wave function. Is it a real physical wave or just a statistical parameter that gives the 
probability of ﬁnding the particle? There was a famous debate between Bohr and 
Einstein about this question almost one hundred years ago. We still do not have a 
clear answer today [13].

Introduction: The Particle World Versus the Wave World
Fig. 1.2 Richard Feynman. Richard Feynman (1918–1988) was a famous theoretical physicist 
in the US. He made important contributions in the development of quantum electrodynamics. He 
invented the technique of “Feynman diagram” for analyzing the interaction of particles. Feynman 
was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He was a scientist of great personality. “The 
Feynman Lectures on Physics” was based on his lectures given at Caltech, which has become a 
widely used textbook for many top universities in the United States. According to a 1999 poll 
conducted by the British magazine “Physics World”, Feynman was named one of the ten greatest 
physicists of all time. Photo Credit: The Big T (Yearbook of California Institute of Technology);

In the past one hundred years, many leading physicists have been aware of these 
problems. For example, Richard Feynman (see Fig. 1.2), a very well-known physicist 
in the twentieth century, had a famous quote: “I think I can safely say that nobody 
understands quantum mechanics”. [14] 
In his famous book entitled “The Feynman Lectures on Physics”, he further 
elaborated why he thought quantum physics is beyond human understanding: 
Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difﬁcult to get used to 
and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced 
physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly 
reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human 
intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small 
scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or 
imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience. [15] 
Feynman was totally pessimistic about any hope for physicists to understand the 
foundation of quantum mechanics. Feynman was by no means the only pessimistic 
physicist in this regard; many leading physicists had expressed similar views and 
admitted that the foundation of quantum mechanics is very mysterious. For example, 
Roger Penrose, a mathematical physicist in Cambridge University who won the Nobel 
Prize of physics in 2020, once wrote:

1.2 What is the Problem with the Current View of Quantum Physics? Why …

I should begin by expressing my general attitude to present-day quantum theory, by which 
I mean standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The theory has, indeed, two powerful 
bodies of fact in its favour, and only one thing against it. First, in its favour are all the 
marvellous agreements that the theory has had with every experimental result to date. Second, 
and to me almost as important, it is a theory of astonishing and profound mathematical beauty. 
The one thing that can be said against it is that it makes absolutely no sense! [16] 
1.2.2 
Fundamental Conﬂict Between Quantum Mechanics 
and Relativity 
The current quantum theory is a combination of quantum mechanics, special rela-
tivity, and classical ﬁeld theory. There seems to be a serious contradiction between 
these theories on the concept of vacuum. More speciﬁcally, the vacuum in quantum 
mechanics is not empty; it is just the ground state of the quantum system. However, 
the vacuum in special relativity must be an empty space; otherwise, the vacuum will 
provide a universal reference frame to tell which inertial frame is stationary and 
which one is in motion. This would defeat the principle of relativity. This is a serious 
discrepancy. Yet, this problem has been overlooked entirely in the development of 
the current quantum theory. 
1.2.3 
Important Questions that the Current Quantum Theory 
Cannot Resolve 
Furthermore, there are many more important questions about fundamental physics 
that the current quantum theory cannot resolve. For example, 
• Where do the particles come from? How can matter be created from energy? In 
most textbooks, it is frequently stated that energy-mass convertibility is based on 
special relativity. However, many careful literature reviews had shown that this 
is not the case (see Chap. 11). Furthermore, nothing is known about the physical 
mechanism that allows energy to be converted into matter and vice versa. 
• According to the current quantum ﬁeld theory, the creation of particles in the 
vacuum is based on a process that converts virtual particles into real particles. 
However, it is not clear why virtual particles can pre-exist in the vacuum. If  
one thinks the vacuum is an empty space (as it is assumed in special relativity), 
how can something come out from nothing? 
• In the current version of quantum ﬁeld theory, it is hypothesized that a quantum 
particle is an excitation of its own quantum ﬁeld. It is not clear that, between 
particle and ﬁeld, which one is more fundamental? Furthermore, we know 
there are many types of quantum particles; why does nature need so many 
different ﬁelds?

Introduction: The Particle World Versus the Wave World
Apparently, the current version of quantum theory has serious limitations; it is 
not clear that it can take us to a deeper understanding of our physical world. 
1.2.4 
The Particle Physics Establishment Had Given 
up Hopes to Resolve the Fundamental Issues 
To make things worse, not only we do not understand these fundamental issues, 
the physics community today has given up hope to understand such issues; they 
are not interested in this kind of research. For example, Sean Carroll, a physicist 
in Caltech who is also a popular scientiﬁc writer, stated explicitly in the Prologue 
of his recent book [17]: “You might think …that the quest to understand quantum 
mechanics would be the single biggest goal in all of physics. Millions of dollars of 
grant money would ﬂow to researchers in quantum foundations, the brightest minds 
would ﬂock to the problem, … Sadly, no. Not only is the quest to make sense of 
quantum mechanics not considered a high-status specialty within modern physics; 
in many quarters it’s considered barely respectable at all, if not actively disparaged. 
Most physics departments have nobody working on the problem, and those who 
choose to do so are looked upon with suspicion”. 
Today, the physics establishment teaches only theories that ﬁt the current views. 
In most physics textbooks, they try to shy away from discussing any discrepancy 
within the established theories. Most physicists treat quantum mechanics as a useful 
tool, but do not wish to be bothered with ﬁnding out where this tool comes from. 
There was a famous quote about the common attitude of today’s physicists when 
they are asked by their students to explain quantum physics. Their answer could be: 
“Shut up and calculate!”.1 
This is not a very satisfying situation. To overcome the problems facing quantum 
theory today, perhaps we should explore the use of alternative approaches to develop 
quantum theory. In other words, should we be considering a paradigm shift? Would 
it be more effective to use the wave view rather than the particle view to explain 
physical events at the sub-atomic level? 
1.3 
The Basic Idea of the Quantum Wave Model 
We agree with Feynman that the microscopic world is indeed vastly different from 
the macroscopic world. However, we believe it is still possible for humans to under-
stand the physical mechanisms in the microscopic world if we are willing to care-
fully study nature. Our proposal is that physicists should give up the traditional
1 This quote was often attributed to Feynman. But according to David Mermin, he was the ﬁrst one 
to make this quote. He wrote in Physics Today in 1989: “If I were forced to sum up in one sentence 
what the Copenhagen interpretation says to me, it would be “Shut up and calculate!”. 

1.3 The Basic Idea of the Quantum Wave Model

concept of regarding the sub-atomic particle (such as an electron) as a corpuscular 
object. Instead, one needs to realize that the electron is more like a quantized exci-
tation wave instead of a tiny billiard ball (see Fig. 1.3). The motion of the quantum 
particle is governed by wave mechanics which should be developed based on the 
wave properties of the vacuum medium. 
Unlike the particle view used in mainstream quantum physics today, we proposed 
that all sub-atomic particles are quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium. 
Thus, not only the photon is a quantized excitation wave, the electron is also an 
excitation wave in the microscopic view; it behaves like a particle only in the macro-
scopic view (see Fig. 1.3). In fact, in our model, sub-atomic particles like proton and 
neutron are also quantized excitation waves. Thus, the atom is composed of quan-
tized excitation waves instead of corpuscular particles. This implies that the entire 
material world is composed of quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium. 
We call this new theory “the quantum wave model”; it is based on three simple 
hypotheses: 
(1) The vacuum is a wave medium. 
(2) The quantum particle is a quantized excitation wave of the vacuum 
medium. 
(3) Different types of quantum particles are represented by different excitation 
modes of the vacuum medium. 
Here, the quantum particles include all sorts of “elementary particles”, such 
as photons, electrons/positrons, muons, and neutrinos. Hadrons, like protons and 
neutrons, are slightly more complicated because they are composite particles. We
Fig. 1.3 Classical view versus the quantum view of a particle. The classical particle is generally 
thought to be a corpuscular object, just like a tiny billiard ball; the position and momentum of this 
particle can be independently deﬁned. In the case of a quantum particle, it is more like a quantized 
excitation wave instead of a tiny billiard ball; its position and momentum cannot be independently 
determined

Introduction: The Particle World Versus the Wave World
believe they are also quantized excitation waves, but their wave structures could be 
highly complicated (see Chap. 17). 
From this hypothesis, it is predicted that the equation of motion for a quantum 
particle is essentially determined by the physical properties of the vacuum medium. 
Thus, we expect that the wave equation of photon and the quantum wave equation 
of electron can both be derived based on the same wave excitation mechanism of the 
vacuum medium (see Part 2). 
1.3.1 
Justiﬁcation for the Hypotheses of the Quantum Wave 
Model 
Is there any supporting evidence for the above hypotheses? Yes, our model is based 
on well-established experimental facts, for example: 
1. The concept of vacuum being a medium is a well-based idea in physics. Before 
the twentieth century, it was widely believed that the vacuum is ﬁlled with an 
aether-like medium. This understanding was based on the studies of light and 
electromagnetism. Although the original aether hypothesis was later disfavored, 
there was strong evidence indicating that vacuum is not an empty space (see 
Appendix A). 
2. We know at least one quantum particle, i.e., the photon, is a quantized physical 
wave. 
3. The phenomena of particle-wave duality are well demonstrated in experiments. 
Particularly, the diffraction experiment indicated that the electron behaves very 
similarly to a photon. Thus, the electron must also be a quantized physical wave. 
4. A very important ﬁnding in modern physics is that particles can be created or 
annihilated in the vacuum. This fact suggests that quantum particles could be 
excitation waves of the vacuum medium. 
5. In the experimental study of particle physics, it is frequently observed that one 
type of particle can be converted into other types of particles during collision 
or decay. These observations suggest that different particles could be different 
excitation modes of the vacuum medium. 
6. It is well known that all particles have the same traveling speed limit. That is, 
no particle can travel faster than the speed of light, which is c. Since the speed 
of wave traveling in a medium is determined entirely by the physical properties 
of the wave medium, the fact that the speed limits for all particles are the same 
suggests that all quantum particles could be excitation waves of the same medium. 
These points will be discussed in detail in the following chapters of this book.

1.4 
How Can the Quantum Wave Model Help to Resolve 
the Problems Encountered in the Current Quantum 
Theory? 
Using this quantum wave model, we will show that it is possible to resolve the 
“mystery” of quantum mechanics. First, the quantum wave model can directly 
explain the phenomenon of wave-particle duality. According to our hypothesis, 
photons and electrons are both excitation waves of the vacuum; this explains why 
they behave similarly in the double-slit or diffraction experiments. 
Second, by using the wave approach instead of the particle approach, one can 
explain more easily the physical basis of particle creation/annihilation. If parti-
cles are excitation waves of the vacuum, the vacuum will be free of particle when 
it is at its resting state. Then, when the vacuum is excited with an energy stimulus, 
particles will be created due to the generation of new waves. Similarly, in the process 
of wave-wave interactions, some waves may be destroyed in order to create new 
waves. This may explain why particles can be converted into different types during 
interactions. 
Third, there is a clear advantage of a conceptual uniﬁcation between light wave 
and matter wave. As we will show later, from the Maxwell theory and Helmholtz 
decomposition, one can derive not only the wave equation of photons, but also the 
quantum wave equations for electrons (e.g., the Dirac equation and the Schrödinger 
equation). The only assumption here is that both the matter wave and the radiation 
wave are excitation waves of the vacuum medium. (For details, see Chaps. 7, 8 and 
9). 
Finally, to further demonstrate the usefulness of the wave approach, we will use 
the quantum wave model to address a number of deep questions in fundamental 
physics. For example: 
• What is the physical basis of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle? (See Chap. 3) 
• What is the physical property of the vacuum? Can the vacuum satisfy the physical 
requirements of being a wave medium? (See Chap. 6) 
• Can one use the wave excitation mechanism in the vacuum to derive the quantum 
wave equations for a massive particle (such as an electron)? (See Chaps. 8 and 9) 
• How can a wave have mass? (See Chap. 11) 
• Why can energy and mass be converted between each other? (See Chap. 11). 
• Why is mass speed-dependent? (See Chap. 12) 
• Why do all particles have the same traveling speed limit? (See Chap. 12) 
• How can a wave behave like a particle in the macroscopic world? (See Chap. 11) 
• If matter is composed of waves, how can the waves generate gravity? (See 
Chaps. 12 and 15) 
In the following chapters of this book, we will try to answer these questions in 
detail one by one. These discussions are based on a series of research papers published 
by the author in recent years [18–28].

The Birth of Quantum Mechanics: 
Arriving of the Photon Concept 
Before the twentieth century, the concepts of particle and wave are entirely indepen-
dent. A particle is supposed to be a mechanical object like a point mass, while the 
wave is a spread-out oscillation of a medium. The concepts of “particle” and “wave” 
thus are totally different. 
At the end of the nineteenth century, physicists discovered that this conventional 
thinking may not be entirely true. This was mainly due to the study of blackbody 
radiation by a German scientist, Max Planck. 
As we all know, light is a form of radiation. In classical physics, the distribution 
of energy in the radiation wave is supposed to be continuous. However, Planck 
discovered that the energy of light cannot be continuous. Light is transmitted in an 
undividable package of energy, which was later called a “quantum”. Such behavior 
is very much like that of a particle. So, Planck’s ﬁnding suggested that light could 
have both particle and wave properties. 
2.1 
Is Light a Wave or a Particle? How Do We Know 
that Light is a Wave? 
In fact, even before Planck’s study, there had been a historical debate on the physical 
nature of light. The modern study of light probably started in the seventeenth century. 
There were two major contributors in studying the physics of light: One is Isaac 
Newton and the other is Christiaan Huygens. In Newton’s view, light is composed 
of particles or corpuscular objects. His major argument was that light always travels 
in straight lines, while waves will bend around obstacles. Another argument is that 
Newton’s theory could predict the reﬂection of light. When light is reﬂected on a 
smooth surface, the incoming angle and the outgoing angle is exactly the same. This 
is just like bouncing a ball. Because Newton was such an inﬂuential physicist at that

time, his theory regarding light as particles played a dominant role in the seventeenth 
century. 
2.1.1 
The Double-Slit Experiment 
Around the same time, another well-known physicist Huygens proposed a different 
model of light. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of 
waves in a medium called the luminiferous aether [1, 2]. The debate between the 
particle view of light and the wave view of light carried on for the next two centuries. 
Finally, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the wave nature of light was 
clearly demonstrated in the results of the double-slit interference experiment. This 
experiment was conducted by Thomas Young in 1801 [3, 4]. The design of this 
experiment was very simple: Let a beam of light pass through a partition with two 
small slits, and then project it onto a screen behind the partition. By looking at the 
interference results on the screen, one can tell whether the light is a particle or a 
wave. 
What is the experimental principle of this double-slit interference experiment? If 
a light beam is composed of individual particles (like a train of tiny bullets), when it 
passes through a slit, it will just appear as a bright line on the screen. When another 
beam of light passes through another slit, it will also appear as a bright line behind 
the slit. So, if light is composed of particles, the light beam passing through the 
double-slit can only leave two bright lines on the screen behind the double-slit. (See 
Fig. 2.1). 
Now, if light is a wave, it will exhibit an interference phenomenon (see Fig. 2.2). 
A series of alternating light and dark bands will appear on the screen. This is called 
“interference fringes”. The principle of the double-slit interference experiment is 
very simple. When Thomas Young conducted this light double-slit experiment, he

mechanical particles. 
According to the double-slit 
interference experiment 
designed by Thomas Young, 
if light were made of 
particles like steel balls, they 
would not interfere, so there 
would only be two bright 
lines on the detection screen.

observed that light indeed produced interference fringes after passing through the 
double-slit, so he demonstrated that light was a kind of wave [3, 4]. 
2.1.2 
The Bragg Diffraction Experiment 
Another strong evidence to indicate that light is a wave is the result of the Bragg 
diffraction experiment. Following the double-slit experiment, physicists later discov-
ered one can generate an interference pattern from the refraction of light from a crystal 
surface. This is called the Bragg diffraction. The Bragg diffraction was proposed by 
Lawrence Bragg and his father Henry Bragg in 1913 to explain their discovery that 
crystalline solids produced peculiar patterns of reﬂected X-rays [5]. They found 
that these crystals produced intense peaks of reﬂected radiation at certain speciﬁc 
wavelengths and incident angles. 
The principle of Bragg diffraction is very simple. It is based on the summa-
tion of two light beams diffracted from two neighboring rows of atoms in a crystal. 
Depending on the diffraction angle, the combination of these neighboring light beams 
could be constructive or destructive based on their phase difference. And thus, an 
alternating light-and-dark pattern could be observed in the diffracted plate. Construc-
tive interference occurs when the path difference between two adjacent reﬂecting 
light beams equals to an integer multiple of the wavelength of the radiation; this is 
called the “Bragg condition”. Since the diffraction of X-ray can be fully described 
by the Bragg diffraction, it was convincingly concluded that X-ray must be a wave.

2.1.3 
Maxwell and Hertz Showed that Light is a Kind 
of Electromagnetic Wave 
The most convincing argument for light being a wave comes from the work of 
Maxwell and Hertz. In the middle of nineteenth century, Maxwell worked out a 
very inﬂuential treatise on the study of electromagnetic waves [6]. In his theory, he 
predicted that light is a kind of electromagnetic radiation, one of the evidence he 
cited is that based on his mathematical calculation, the speed of the propagation of 
the electromagnetic wave is identical to the speed of light that was experimentally 
determined at that time. A few years later, Hertz experimentally conﬁrmed Maxwell’s 
theory by building an experimental device that can generate and detect radio waves 
between two location points [7]. He demonstrated very convincingly that the electro-
magnetic radiation wave behaves exactly like light. So, from then on, people clearly 
recognize that light is a wave. 
2.2 
The Discovery of Light Wave Behaving like a Particle 
2.2.1 
Quantization of Light 
At the end of the nineteenth century, there was a remarkable conceptual change 
regarding the physical nature of light. As we discussed above, light is clearly a wave 
in the classical view. But with the emerging of quantum physics, people started to 
realize that light is composed of discrete packages of energy, each of which could be 
regarded as a particle. (This particle-like quantum of energy is now called “photon”). 
The birth of quantum mechanics is commonly attributed to the discovery of Max 
Planck (see Fig. 2.3). In order to explain black-body radiation, Planck postulated that 
the radiation energy is transmitted in package (called “quantum”) [8]. Einstein later 
studied the photoelectric effect and also came up with the conclusion that the energy 
of light is not transferred continuously as in a classical wave, but in small “packets”. 
Einstein’s explanation for these observations was that light itself is quantized. The 
size of these “packets” of energy was the same as Planck’s “energy element”, which 
was found to be proportional to the frequency ν of the radiation wave. This relation 
is now called the Planck’s relation: 
up pe r E equals h nu period
The constant “h” here is called the “Planck’s constant”. When the Planck’s relation 
was ﬁrst proposed in 1900, h was thought to be just a proportional constant between 
the minimal increment of energy E (of a hypothetical linear oscillator in a black body 
radiation cavity) and the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave [8]. Later 
in 1905, in a study of photoelectric effect, the value E was theoretically associated

by Einstein with quantum energy of the electromagnetic wave itself [9]. The light 
quantum behaved in some aspects like a particle, which was later named the “photon”. 
2.3 
How Did Planck Derive the Planck’s Relation? 
How did Planck develop his revolutionary idea? It was closely related with the study 
of black-body radiation. In 1894, Planck was commissioned by electric companies 
to improve the efﬁciency of lightbulbs. At that time, it was known that the intensity 
and color of the light emitted by a black body (a perfect absorber, also known as 
a cavity radiator) is closely related to its temperature. But no theoretical treatment 
was found to agree with experimental data. Before Planck’s work, Wilhelm Wien in 
1896 had proposed a model to describe the spectrum of thermal radiation [10, 11], 
u S ubscript nu Baseline equals StartFraction 8 pi h nu cubed Over c cubed EndFraction exp StartFraction minus h nu Over k upper T EndFraction comma

u S u
bscript nu Baseline equals StartFraction 8 pi h nu cubed Over c cubed EndFraction exp StartFraction minus h nu Over k upper T EndFraction comma
where h is an empirical ﬁtting constant. The Wien’s law correctly predicted the 
radiation behavior at high frequencies but failed at low frequencies. In 1900, a British 
physicist John Rayleigh proposed another model to describe thermal radiation which 
was later developed to become the Rayleigh–Jeans law [12, 13], 
u Subscript nu Baseline d nu equals StartFraction 8 pi nu squared k upper T d nu Over c cubed EndFraction period
u S
u
bscript nu Baseline d nu equals StartFraction 8 pi nu squared k upper T d nu Over c cubed EndFraction period
This model was able to ﬁt the data well at low frequencies but failed badly at high 
frequency (known as “UV catastrophe”) (See Fig. 2.4).
Planck realized that if he can interpolate the Wein’s Law with Rayleigh-Jeans 
Law, he might be able to ﬁnd a correct theory to describe the black-body radiation. 
Planck’s original argument was very complicated, which was hidden in cumber-
some formulism of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics [11]. A more compre-
hensible treatment of Planck’s argument was put forward by Debye in 1910 [11,

14]. In the following, we will brieﬂy review Planck’s derivation of h using Debye’s 
cleaned-up version as outlined by John Slater [11]. 
Planck’s theory was basically to treat the emitter in the black-body radiation as a 
linear oscillator, 
up pe r E eq ua ls upper T plus upper V equals StartFraction p squared Over 2 m EndFraction plus StartFraction m omega squared Over 2 EndFraction q squared period

up per 
E equals upper T plus upper V equals StartFraction p squared Over 2 m EndFraction plus StartFraction m omega squared Over 2 EndFraction q squared period
Here, E, T and V represent the total energy, kinetic energy and potential energy, 
respectively; q is the generalized coordinate and p is the generalized momentum; m 
and ω are the mass and frequency of the oscillator. If one maps the energy distribution 
in the phase space, one will ﬁnd that the contour of a constant energy is an ellipse 
(Fig. 2.5a), since Eq. (2.3) can be reduced into 
StartFraction p squared Over a squared EndFraction plus StartFraction q squared Over b squared EndFraction equals 1 comma

be

bution in phase space. Here, q is the generalized coordinate and p is the generalized momentum. 
The energy distribution is given by Eq. (2.3). The contour of a constant energy is an ellipse. When 
energy is increased from E to E + ΔE, the corresponding incremental area in the phase space is ΔA 
= ΔE/v (shadowed area). b Planck’s step-wise energy distribution model for emitter in black-body 
radiation. The smooth curve was assumed to become a step-wise function with a constant jump of 
magnitude ΔE (dotted lines). Credit: This ﬁgure is reproduced from an earlier publication of the

Then, when the energy is increased from E to E + ΔE, the corresponding 
incremental area in the phase space is (see Fig. 2.5a) 
nor ma l upp
er Delta upper A equals normal upper Delta upper E divided by nu period
Planck then made the following formal assumptions: The energy distribution of 
the emitter in reality does not follow a smooth curve as described in Eq. (2.3). Instead, 
it is a step-wise function with a constant jump of magnitude ΔE. (See Fig. 2.5b.) The 
reason that ΔE is constant is because nature somehow partitions the phase space of 
the emitter in constant incremental areas (ΔA), which can be called “h”. (i.e., ΔA 
= h, see Fig. 2.5a). According to Eq. (2.6), Planck’s assumptions implied that 
nor ma l u
pper Delta upper E equals h nu period
(This is now called the “Planck’s relation”). With the above assumption, one can 
calculate the average energy of a black-body radiation emitter oscillating at frequency 
v using the Boltzmann distribution, that is,

Since we know the number of energy states per unit volume and per unit frequency 
range in the radiation ﬁeld is 8 pi nu squared divided by c cubed, the energy distribution in the radiator then is

u Subscript nu Ba
seline equals StartFraction 8 pi h nu cubed Over c cubed EndFraction StartFraction 1 Over exp left parenthesis h nu divided by k upper T right parenthesis minus 1 EndFraction period
This equation is now known as the “Planck’s law”. It ﬁtted the experimental data 
of black-body radiation as reported by Lummer and Pringsheim very well. One 
can see easily that at low frequency, Planck’s law can be reduced to become the 
Rayleigh-Jeans law. And, at high frequency, Planck’s law becomes Wien’s law. 
From the above review, one can see that in Planck’s original model, h can be inter-
preted as a hypothetical constant incremental area in the phase space of the emitter. If 
the value of h is very small, this model will become the classical equipartition model 
as used in the derivation of Rayleigh-Jeans Law. So the basic difference between the 
quantum model and the classical model of black-body radiation is essentially whether 
the magnitude of h is signiﬁcantly large or not. Based on experimental observations, 
Planck estimated that the value of h was 6.55 × 10 − 34 J s [8], which is within 1.2% 
of the present value (6.62607 × 10–34 J s) [15]. This value is proven sufﬁciently large 
so that we cannot ignore the quantum effects in radiation. 
2.4 
Further Evidence Supporting the Idea of Photon 
2.4.1 
The Photo-Electric Effect 
Although Planck was the ﬁrst one to suggest that light energy was emitted in packets, 
Einstein (see Fig. 2.6) was the ﬁrst person to realize that light energy is transmitted and 
absorbed in packets (now called “photons”) [9]. Such quantum behavior of photon 
was demonstrated in his analysis of the photoelectric effect. Einstein’s idea was very 
straight forward. Based on Planck’s result, he simply assumed that the energy of a 
photon is E = hv. When light is shined on an object, some of the electrons within that 
solid object will absorb part of the light energy. Einstein assumed that the energy of

Fig. 2.6 Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was probably the most famous physicist 
in modern times. He made important contributions in many ﬁelds, including photoelectric effect, 
special relativity, general relativity, statistical mechanics, and more. He was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect. As a legendary ﬁgure, Einstein 
was a social activist. He was inﬂuential both in political thinking and in philosophy. Photo Credit:

the entire photon is absorbed by one electron. Such energy can be used to (a) knock 
out the electron from the solid; and (b) provide the excited electron with kinetic 
energy. Thus, 
Kinetic energy of the electron equals h 
nu minus upper W comma
where the “work function” W is the amount of work required to move an electron from 
the solid to its surface. This idea can be tested by conducting a simple experiment. 
The kinetic energy of the excited electron can be measured by surrounding the solid 
with a conducting cage with a negative potential (V). When eV equals to the kinetic 
energy of the excited electron, no electron can leave the cage. In this situation, 
e u pper V eq
uals h nu minus upper W period
This relation predicted by Einstein was shown to agree well with experiments 
[16, 17]. 
The study of the photoelectric effect was an important demonstration of the 
quantum nature of light. Einstein, however, did not try to examine the physical 
meaning of h in his study. He simply used the Planck’s relation to obtain the value 
of the energy quanta.

2.4.2 
The Compton Scattering 
Another evidence showing that light could behave like a corpuscular object is the 
Compton scattering experiment [18]. This experiment was carried out by Arthur 
Compton in 1923 at Washington University. The Compton scattering experiment 
basically studied the inelastic scattering of light by an electron. The wavelength 
of the scattered light is different from that of the incident radiation. In Compton’s 
original experiment, he used X ray as the light source and treated the electrons as 
free particles after the scattering. In his experiment, he measured mainly two things: 
(1) Change of the wavelength between the incident light and the scattered light; 
and (2) the angle between incoming light and the scattered light. He explained his 
experimental data using a model which treated the X ray photon as a classical particle. 
In the Compton scattering experiment, the photon and electron are treated as 
corpuscular objects [18]. Compton used classical mechanics to explain the interac-
tion between the incoming X ray photon and the recoil of the targeted electron. He 
worked out a simple formula called the “Compton scattering”. The result of his exper-
iment was highly consistent with his calculated result. The success of the Compton 
scattering experiment convinced physicists that light can be treated as a stream of 
particle-like objects called “photon”; and, the energy of the photon is proportional 
to the frequency of the light wave as predicted by the Planck’s relation. 
From then on, the photon was regarded as an elementary particle in the mainstream 
physics community.

Chapter 3 
Derivation of the Planck’s Relation, 
the de Broglie Relation, and Heisenberg’s 
Uncertainty Principle Based 
on the Maxwell Theory 
As we summarized in the last chapter, the arrival of quantum physics began with 
the discovery that the energy of light appears to be quantized. Based on the study of 
black-body radiation, Max Planck found that the energy of light is not transmitted 
continuously as in a classical wave, but in small “packets” [1]. Later, Einstein studied 
the photoelectric effect and inferred that the absorption of light by an atom is also 
quantized. From then on, the idea of energy quantization of light is widely accepted. 
It is generally believed that light (a radiation wave) is carried by a stream of particles 
(“photons”). The energy of each photon is proportional to the frequency ν of the 
radiation wave as given by the Planck’s relation 
upper E equals h nu
The physical basis of this relation, however, remains unclear. Although Planck 
was able to derive the Planck’s relation using a simple “step-wise oscillator energy” 
model (see Chap. 2), he realized that his original proposal was somewhat arbitrary. 
Also, he was not able to identify the physical meaning of h based on any well-
established physical laws. In this chapter, we will show that those deﬁciency can be 
overcome. We believe that there should be a connection between quantum mechanics 
and classical electrodynamics. All quantum relations, including the Planck’s relation, 
the de Broglie relation, and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, can ﬁnd a root in 
the classical Maxwell theory.

Derivation of the Planck’s Relation, the de Broglie Relation …
3.1 Why is Light Quantized? What is the Physical Meaning 
of the Planck’s Constant? 
3.1.1 
Planck Was not Satisﬁed with His Original Derivation 
At ﬁrst, Planck thought that the idea of energy quantization was only “a purely formal 
assumption … actually I did not think much about it…” [2]. He was fully aware that 
this assumption was not compatible with classical physics. Thus, Planck spent the 
rest of his life trying to grasp the meaning of energy quanta. Planck was concerned 
that his black-body radiation theory had a number of problems, including: 
• He did not directly calculate the radiation energy of the electromagnetic wave 
emitted from the black body. Instead, his model only calculated the energy distri-
bution of the radiation emitter which was modeled as a linear oscillator. Such 
modeling needs to be justiﬁed. 
• He assumed that the energy distribution of the emitter does not follow a smooth 
curve as described by the linear oscillator; instead, it is a step-wise function with 
a constant jump of magnitude ΔE. This assumption of partitioning the phase space 
(of the oscillator) in equal incremental area was somewhat arbitrary. 
• There was a lack of understanding on the physical basis of the Planck’s constant, h. 
He could not derive the physical meaning of this constant based on ﬁrst principle. 
Planck spent subsequent years trying to justify his theory on better physical 
grounds but was not successful [3]. “My unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate 
the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me 
much trouble” [4]. 
So, although the Planck’s relation was a great success, Planck was not satisﬁed 
with the physical meaning of h as he derived it. The other major contributors of 
quantum physics did not give much help in this regard. For example, the study of the 
photoelectric effect was an important demonstration of the quantum nature of light; 
Einstein, however, did not try to examine the physical meaning of h in his study. 
He simply used the Planck’s relation to obtain the value of the energy quanta. Like 
Einstein, de Broglie did not try to re-examine the physical origin of the Planck’s 
constant.

3.2 Derivation of the Planck’s Relation Based

3.2.1 
Energy and Momentum of the Electromagnetic Wave 
The Planck’s relation was originally postulated based on phenomenological consid-
erations rather than ﬁrst principles. In order to have a better understanding of this 
relation, we believe that it should be derived based on a more solid physical founda-
tion, such as the Maxwell’s theory [5]. In this chapter, we will uncover the physical 
meaning of h by treating the photon as a wave packet of electromagnetic radiation 
and directly calculating the total energy and momentum contained within the wave 
packet.1 More explicitly, 
• We will regard the photon as a wave packet which is made up of an oscillating 
electromagnetic ﬁeld. 
• The energy (E) and momentum (p) of the electromagnetic ﬁeld contained within 
the wave packet can be calculated based on the Maxwell theory. 
• We will examine whether E is proportional to the oscillating frequency v. If yes, 
the proportional constant will be identiﬁed as the Planck’s constant. 
The energy density of an electromagnetic ﬁeld is known to be [6]

Here, ρ is the mass density of the string, and uper F 1 is the tension of the string [7]. One 
can immediately see that, in the electromagnetic system, Ax appears to play the role 
of a propagating ﬁeld, just like the displacement phiin the stretched string.

3.3 Calculating the Energy Contained Within a Wave 
Packet Based on Fourier Transform 
To ﬁnd the physical meaning of the Planck’s constant, we need to calculate the 
total energy left angle bracket upper U right angle bracketcontained within the wave packet representing one single photon. 
This energy can be obtained directly by integrating the energy density described in 
Eq. (3.10) over the entire volume of the wave packet:

In order to carry out this integration, one must know the structure of a photon. In 
the literature, a photon is usually described by Eq. (3.5). This, however, is not strictly 
correct since it represents a continuous wave, which spreads over the entire space 
and time. The photon should have a limited size along its trajectory (z-axis) and in 
the transverse plane (xy plane). It should be a wave packet, which is constructed by 
superposition of multiple wave components. Figure 3.3 shows three basic types of 
traveling waves: (a) A continuous wave. The wave frequency is a ﬁxed constant. (b) 
A wave packet with limited spread on the space and time dimensions (Δ ω is very 
small). (c) A wave packet with a narrow spread over space and time (Δ ω is very 
large). What does a photon look like? Since a coherent light (such as a laser) has

where upper A 0 left parenthesis x comma y comma z comma t right parenthesisdescribes the envelope of the wave packet. Since the photon

upper
 Q equals StartFraction omega Over normal upper Delta omega EndFraction period 
The value of the Q factor is determined by the properties of the transmitting

Determination of the Planck’s Constant 
Next, we need to calculate the value of rho Subscript Sub Subscript upper T. Its value can be easily determined if one 
knows the functional form of upper A Subscript upper T. As we had discussed earlier, the size of the wave 
packet in the transverse plane cannot be inﬁnite. The simplest way to model upper A Subscript upper T is 
to assume that it has a constant value up to a cut-off radius (r 0). upper A Subscript upper T then vanishes 
when r > r 0. A more reasonable model, however, is to assume that upper A Subscript upper T follows a 
bell-shaped Gaussian distribution (see Fig. 3.4), i.e., 
upper A  S ubscript upper 
T Baseline left parenthesis r comma theta right parenthesis equals a e Superscript minus r squared divided by 2 sigma squared Baseline comma
where a is the amplitude of the envelope function. From Eqs. (3.20) and (3.26),

3.4 Derivation of the de Broglie Relation: Total Momentum

By treating the photon as a wave packet of electromagnetic radiation, we can also 
calculate the total momentum contained within the wave packet. It is well known 
that the energy ﬂow of the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be described by the Poynting 
vector S: [6]

Since it can be shown that in a radiation system, StartAbsoluteValue bold upper E EndAbsoluteValue equals c StartAbsoluteValue bold upper B EndAbsoluteValue, then,

Therefore, the Planck’s constant derived by us not only satisﬁes the Planck’s

3.5 Derivation of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle 
One of the most important relations in quantum mechanics is the “Uncertainty Prin-
ciple” proposed by the German physicist, Werner Heisenberg (see Fig. 3.5). Based on 
the wave packet model, not only can we derive the Planck’s relation and de Broglie’s 
relation, but we can also easily derive Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.

cist. He introduced the use of matrix into quantum mechanics and developed a set of quantum 
mechanical equations. During his work at the University of Copenhagen with Bohr, he published

Derivation of the Planck’s Relation, the de Broglie Relation …
If one accepts that a photon is a wave packet of oscillating electromagnetic ﬁeld, 
which follows a Gaussian distribution along the particle trajectory, the half-width of 
the wave packet in the time domain can be directly determined from the linewidth 
of the radiation wave. From the condition of Fourier transform, we know 
sigma Su bscr
ipt omega Baseline dot sigma Subscript t Baseline equals 1 comma
where sigma Subscript omega and sigma Subscript t are the standard deviations in the frequency domain and the time 
domain. Since we know the half-width of the wave packet is normal upper  Delta t equals 2.355 sigma Subscript t and the 
linewidth of the oscillation frequency is normal upper  Delta omega equals 2.355 sigma Subscript omega, Equation (3.18) implies
norma l upper Delta omega dot normal upper Delta t equals left parenthesis 2.355 right parenthesis squared . From the Planck’s relation, E = italic h over two pi omega, we have
norma l upper Delt a uppe r E dot normal upper Delta t equals italic h over two pi normal upper Delta omega dot normal upper Delta t equals StartFraction h Over 2 pi EndFraction left parenthesis 2.355 right parenthesis squared equals 0.8827 h period
normal upper Delta upper E dot normal upper Delta t equals italic h over two pi normal upper Delta omega dot normal upper Delta t equals StartFraction h Over 2 pi EndFraction left parenthesis 2.355 right parenthesis squared equals 0.8827 h period 
This suggests that the product of linewidths in the energy and time domains for a 
single photon is very close to h. Such a result agrees with Heisenberg’s conjecture 
that
norma l upper 
Delta upper E dot normal upper Delta t almost equals h period 
Thus, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle can be interpreted as a direct result of 
the fact that a photon is a wave packet which follows a Gaussian distribution. 
Using this wave packet model, we can also easily obtain the Uncertainty Principle 
between normal upper Delta pand normal upper Delta z. Recall from the de Broglie relation, no rmal upper Delta p equals italic h over two pi normal upper Delta k equals italic h over two pi left parenthesis 2.355 sigma Subscript k Baseline right parenthesis. 
The half-width of the wave packet is norm al upper  Delta z equals 2.355 sigma Subscript z. From the conditions of the 
Fourier transform, 
sigma Su bscr
ipt k Baseline dot sigma Subscript z Baseline equals 1 period 
Then, the above relations give
norma l upper  Delt a p do t normal upper Delta z equals italic h over two pi normal upper Delta k dot normal upper Delta z equals StartFraction h Over 2 pi EndFraction left parenthesis 2.355 right parenthesis squared sigma Subscript k Baseline sigma Subscript z Baseline equals 0.8827 h period
normal upper Delta p dot normal upper Delta z equals italic h over two pi normal upper Delta k dot normal upper Delta z equals StartFraction h Over 2 pi EndFraction left parenthesis 2.355 right parenthesis squared sigma Subscript k Baseline sigma Subscript z Baseline equals 0.8827 h period 
This agrees with the conjecture of Heisenberg that norma l upper Delta p dot normal upper Delta z almost equals h[9].

3.6 The Principle of All-Or-None: Physical Meaning 
of the Planck’s Constant as Derived from the Maxwell 
Theory 
In the foregoing sections, we demonstrated that one can directly calculate the energy 
of a photon based on the Maxwell’s theory. Based on this result, the Planck’s constant 
is given by 
h equals 13.113 upper Q StartRoot StartFraction epsilon Over mu EndFraction EndRoot normal zeta squared period 
/ h equals 13.113 upper Q StartRoot StartFraction epsilon Over mu EndFraction EndRoot normal zeta squared period
h equals 13.113 upper Q StartRoot StartFraction epsilon Over mu EndFraction EndRoot normal zeta squared period 
Apparently, the Planck’s constant is dependent on the physical properties of the 
vacuum, e.g., the dielectric permittivity ε and magnetic permeability μ. The quality 
factor Q is also a property of the vacuum, since it is dependent on the transmitting 
medium. At this point, we do not know enough about the detailed properties of the 
vacuum to directly calculate Q. But the value of Q can be determined by experiment. 
One can use an optical device to directly measure the linewidth of a photon with 
known frequency. In the literature, there were already some hints about the value of 
Q. For example, it was reported that a solid-state dye laser (at 590 nm) could have a 
linewidth around 350 MHz [10]. This suggests that the Q factor is about 1.45 × 106. 
Our work may motivate more accurate measurement of Q in the future. 
The remaining problem is to consider whether zeta squared can be regarded as a constant 
and what does that mean. From Eq. (3.28), zeta is deﬁned as the integrated area of 
the vector potential at the center of the wave packet. The requirement for ζ being a 
constant means that: Regardless of the oscillating frequency, in order to generate a 
sustainable oscillating wave, nature requires a ﬁxed amount of disturbance in the 
electromagnetic ﬁeld. 
This situation may be understood using an analogy; it is somewhat similar to 
the generation of a nerve impulse. We know that a neuron can transmit a signal to 
its downstream target along its nerve ﬁber (called “axon”). This signal is called an 
“action potential” [11]. It is well known that the generation of action potential has 
the property of “all-or-none”. That means, when the stimulus to the axon is below a 
threshold, no action potential can be generated. But when the stimulus is higher than 
the threshold, a full size action potential will be generated. This action potential will 
propagate along the axon with a constant amplitude (about 100 mV) [12]. In another 
word, one cannot generate an action potential with arbitrarily small amplitude. And, 
no matter how large is the stimulus; one cannot generate an action potential which 
is much larger than 100 mV. That is why people called it “all-or-none”. 
As it turns out, this principle of all-or-none is applied in multiple aspects of 
nature. Not only the transmission of a nerve impulse is all-or-none, the transmission 
of the electromagnetic radiation is also all-or-none. The radiation energy is apparently 
transmitted in small packets (photon), each of which has a limited size and is not 
sub-dividable. Either one can generate a complete photon or generate no photon at 
all. In another word, if the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is smaller than a critical

Derivation of the Planck’s Relation, the de Broglie Relation …
Fig. 3.6 Integrated area of the transverse component upper A Subscript upper T along the x-axis (denoted by “ζ”) 
is a constant during wave propagation. A and B represent the transverse components of two 
different wave packets with different oscillation amplitudes (a) and widths (σ ). Nature requires 
that their integrated areas ( 
√
StartRoot 2 pi EndRoot a sigma) to be the same, i.e., Area A = Area B. Credit: This ﬁgure is 
reproduced from an earlier publication of the author: D. C. Chang, Chin. Phys. B 26, 040301 (2017) 
value, it will not be able to trigger a transmissible excitation wave traveling as a wave 
packet. Instead, the energy will just dissipate in the surrounding. 
This requirement of “all-or-none” means that ζ should have a ﬁxed cut-off value; 
it cannot be arbitrarily small. Thus, although the size of the wave packet is not ﬁxed, 
the total amount of disturbance in the electromagnetic ﬁeld (as measured by ζ) is  
ﬁxed (see Fig. 3.6). If the diameter of the wave packet is very small, the oscillation 
amplitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld within the wave packet must be large enough 
to make ζ reach the threshold value. Alternatively, if the oscillation amplitude of the 
wave packet is small, the size of the wave packet must be large enough to compensate 
it so that the integrated area reaches the threshold value. 
Besides the above considerations, there is another reason suggesting that zeta squared should 
be a constant. Recall that zeta squared was deﬁned by 
rho  S

Sub Subscript upper T Subscript Baseline equals integral Subscript 0 Superscript normal infinity Baseline integral Subscript 0 Superscript 2 pi Baseline StartAbsoluteValue upper A Subscript upper T Baseline left parenthesis r comma theta right parenthesis EndAbsoluteValue squared r d theta d r equals one half normal zeta squared period

As we pointed out earlier, the vector potential (A) in an electromagnetic radiation 
system is equivalent to the amplitude of an oscillation wave in a one-dimensional 
vibrating string. Thus, if one wants to write down the wave function of a photon 
(phi), one can guess that phimust be related to A (with a normalizing factor). Since the 
absolute square of the wave function StartAbsoluteValue phi EndAbsoluteValue squared is usually interpreted as the probability of 
ﬁnding the particle, this suggests that the absolute square of the vector potential of the 
wave packet, 
StartA
bsoluteValue upper A Subscript w p Baseline EndAbsoluteValue squared , is proportional to the probability of ﬁnding the photon. Recall 
that 
StartA

as a measure of “the total probability of ﬁnding the photon at the center of the wave 
packet”. So long as the wave packet represents a single photon, this probability 
should remain constant as the wave packet travels along the trajectory of the photon. 
Thus, the requirement of normal zeta squared being a constant essentially means that, in an optical 
measurement, the probability of ﬁnding the photon at the center of the wave packet 
is always the same. 
In conclusion, we showed that the energy and momentum of a photon can be 
determined by treating the photon as a wave packet of electromagnetic radiation. 
We found the energy of a photon is indeed proportional to its oscillation frequency, 
as postulated in the Planck’s relation. Using the Maxwell theory, one can explicitly 
derive the Planck’s constant h. Furthermore, by treating the photon as a quantized 
wave packet of electromagnetic wave, one can also derive the de Broglie relation and 
Heisenberg’s Uncertainly Principle (see Table 3.1) 
Therefore, the observation of radiation transmitted in discrete energy quanta does 
not mean that the photon is a corpuscular object. Instead, the phenomenon of energy 
quantization only means that the photon is a wave packet which has a critical size; the 
wave packet cannot be arbitrarily small. And, emission and transmission of radiation 
energy must follow the principle of all-or-none.

Derivation of the Planck’s Relation, the de Broglie Relation …
3.7 Chapter Summary 
• In this chapter, we showed that there is a logical transition from classical physics 
to quantum mechanics. 
• More speciﬁcally, the fundamental quantum relations, including the Planck’s rela-
tion, the  de Broglie relation, and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, can all be 
derived based on the classical Maxwell theory. 
• From these derivations, one can identify the physical meaning of the Planck’s 
constant, which is shown to be dependent on the physical properties of the vacuum. 
• The quantization of light is a manifestation of the principle of all-or-none in the 
transmission of the electromagnetic radiation; it means that the wave packet has a 
minimum size and is not sub-dividable. When the vacuum is excited, it can either 
generate a complete wave packet (a photon) or generate no transmittable wave at 
all. 
• Thus, the photon is a wave in nature; it behaves like a particle only in the sense 
that it carries a package of energy which is not sub-dividable. Furthermore, its 
momentum is also quantized following the de Broglie relation. 
• Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle can be interpreted as a direct result of the fact 
that the quantum particle (such as a photon) is a wave packet, the energy content 
of which follows a Gaussian distribution.

The Merging of the Particle and Wave 
Concepts: Evidence Suggesting 
that the Sub-atomic Particle is 
a Quantized Excitation Wave 
As we mentioned above, one of the most amazing discoveries in quantum physics is 
that a quantum particle can behave both like a corpuscular object and a wave. How 
did this concept of wave-particle duality develop? It was based on both theoretical 
predictions and experimental veriﬁcations. In the nineteenth century, it was well 
known that light is an electromagnetic wave. However, it was discovered later that 
light can have the properties of particle too. As we mentioned in the last two chapters, 
this new understanding was mainly due to the works of three scientists, namely: Max 
Planck’s work on black-body radiation [1], Einstein’s photoelectric effect [2], and 
Compton’s X-ray scattering experiment [3]. Their work demonstrated that the light 
wave could behave like a particle. The next surprising discovery in quantum physics 
is that the opposite can also be true; namely, a particle can behave like a wave! 
We know the electron is a particle with rest mass. Surprisingly, it was found in 
some experiments that the electron can sometimes behave like a wave. This creates 
a problem that has troubled physicists for a long time. This problem is generally 
known as the “wave-particle duality”.

already known that a photon has momentum, which is

alized by extending it to all material particles and notably to electrons” [5]. Thus, 
in de Broglie’s mind, radiation waves and matter waves could have similar physical 
properties. 
De Broglie’s hypothesis was too innovative at the time. A professor who reviewed 
his doctoral dissertation, Paul Langevin, was not sure if that was reasonable. After 
reading de Broglie’s doctoral dissertation, he was very hesitant to let de Broglie pass. 
So he wrote a letter to Einstein, along with de Broglie’s thesis, to seek for his opinion. 
Einstein wrote a short message to Langevin, giving a positive evaluation of the thesis. 
Because of that, de Broglie was able to successfully get his doctorate degree. [6]

4.1.2 
Conﬁrmation of the de Broglie Relation Using Bragg’s 
Diffraction Experiments 
When de Broglie proposed his hypothesis in 1924, it attracted some attention in 
the European physics community; there were some interests to test his hypothesis 
experimentally. If de Broglie’s hypothesis is correct, electrons would have wave 
properties and will exhibit a diffraction pattern similar to light. 
The early twentieth century was a golden age of new discoveries in physics. 
Several years before de Broglie put forward his hypothesis, some experimental physi-
cists had already started doing diffraction experiments using electrons. In 1921, a 
physicist at the Western Electric laboratory (later becomes the “Bell Labs”) in the 
United States, Clinton Davisson, had conducted diffraction experiments by using 
electrons to hit different metal surfaces [7]. The original purpose of the experiment 
was to gain a better understanding of the structure of atoms. Inspired by Ruther-
ford’s 1911 experiment in striking gold foil with alpha particles, Davisson thought 
that using electrons for bombardment could yield more information because the elec-
tron is much smaller than alpha particles. He placed a piece of metal in a vacuum 
tube, shot it with an electron beam, and used a movable electron detector to record 
the spread of the diffracted electrons. However, the results he got only supported the 
atomic model of Rutherford; he had no new discoveries. 
In late 1924, Germer joined Davisson’s group and they resumed the diffraction 
experiments. The progress of their experiment was still very slow. Later, an accident 
in their equipment gave them an unexpected inspiration. They found out that if they 
switched their metal sample to single-crystal nickel, they could obtain much clearer 
diffraction experimental results than before [7]. 
In the summer of 1926, Davisson took a vacation to Britain. During this trip, 
Davisson stopped by Oxford to attend an academic conference. At that time, Europe 
was the center of physics. After de Broglie put forward the hypothesis of matter 
waves in 1924, Schrödinger in 1926 had just published the wave equation of elec-
trons (Schrödinger equation). Being far away in America, Davisson didn’t know 
much about these new developments. Davisson attended a lecture by Max Born at 
the Oxford conference in which it was mentioned that de Broglie’s theory of matter 
waves could be tested experimentally. One of the experiments cited by Max Born was 
the diffraction experiment Davisson did in 1923. This surprised Davisson. After this 
meeting, Davisson returned to his laboratory and decided to change the purpose of his 
experiment to verifying the wave theory of electrons. Through rigorous and meticu-
lous work, Davisson and Germer ﬁnally found clear electron diffraction results. Its 
characterization is similar to that obtained by diffraction using X-rays, which fully 
agrees with de Broglie’s relation. They published their experimental results in Nature 
in 1927, clearly demonstrating the wave properties of electrons and thus supporting 
the theory of matter waves as proposed by de Broglie [8]. 
One month after Davisson and Germer’s article was published, a British physi-
cist George Thomson also published the results of their experiments verifying the 
properties of electron waves in Nature [9]. They shot electrons to a sheet of metal,

behind which there was a detection plate. They found that the detection plate showed 
a pattern of diffraction with co-centric rings. This image was very similar to using 
X-rays to shine on a sheet of metal. 
Davisson and Thomson shared the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discov-
eries of electron diffraction and thus conﬁrming that electrons have wave properties. 
Later, it was demonstrated that many massive particles besides electrons could also 
exhibit wave properties. These particles include neutrons, helium, neon, argon, etc. 
[10–15]. 
4.1.3 
Double-Slit Experiment for a Single Electron 
Although the diffraction experiment of electrons has conﬁrmed the wave nature of 
electrons, a more direct experiment to show that electrons are waves would be the 
double-slit interference experiment. Feynman had proposed such a thought experi-
ment in his “Feynman Lectures on Physics” [16]. This double-slit interference exper-
iment can clearly demonstrate that an electron does not behave like a classical particle 
(i.e., a point mass). 
Feynman’s electron double-slit interference experiment was inspired by the 
double-slit experiment of light (see Fig. 4.2). Previously, the wave nature of light was 
demonstrated based on the results of the double-slit interference experiment of light 
as proposed by Thomas Young. Now, if one uses an electron beam instead of a light 
beam to conduct the double-slit interference experiment, one can easily determine 
if the electron has wave properties or not. For example, if an interference pattern is 
produced on the screen behind the double-slit, one will know that the electron is a 
wave. 
Fig. 4.2 A double-slit experiment using electrons yields a pattern of interference fringes. 
From the known wave-particle duality property of electrons, Feynman proposed that if a double-slit 
experiment was performed with electrons, the pattern of interference fringes would be obtained.

of 6235 electrons; it shows a clear interference pattern. Image credit: R. Bach et al. New J. Phys.,

At the time when Feynman proposed the electron double-slit interference experi-
ment (in the 1960s), it was technically difﬁcult to do. Since the de Broglie wavelength 
of electrons is much shorter than that of photons of ordinary visible light, one must 
narrow the slits to a very small size. In recent years, with the development of semicon-
ductor chips, scientists can use micro-fabrication technology to do the nano-scale 
engraving work. Now, the double-slit interference experiment for electron can be 
easily demonstrated [17] (see Fig.  4.3). 
The double-slit experiment not only demonstrated that the electron behaves like 
a wave, the most amazing thing about this experiment is that the generation of such 
interference fringes does not come from the mutual interference between different 
electrons, but an electron itself can interfere with itself. How do we know that? When 
doing a double-slit interference experiment, the researcher can reduce the density of 
electrons shooting at the double-slit to less than one electron per second. One can still 
observe the interference fringes on the screen behind the double-slit (see Fig. 4.3). 
If we treat the electron as a particle (like a tiny bullet), an electron can only pass 
through one of the two slits. There should be no interference, since it is impossible for 
the electron to pass through the other slit at the same time. The observed interference 
phenomenon implies that a single electron must pass through both slits at the same 
time. How can the electron do that? This really puzzled scientists. 
So, this double-slit experiment demonstrated a very strange phenomenon; in one 
way, the electron seems to behave like a particle (i.e., producing a single spot at the 
detector); but in another way, it can’t be an individual particle; it must behave like a 
wave (i.e., producing an interference pattern). This has really puzzled scientists for 
a long time. 
Therefore, Feynman made the following conclusion in his Lectures on Physics: 
“And no one has ﬁgured a way out of this puzzle. So at the present time we must limit 
ourselves to computing probabilities. We say “at the present time,” but we suspect

very strongly that it is something that will be with us forever—that it is impossible 
to beat that puzzle—that this is the way nature really is” [16]. 
4.2 
How to Explain Wave-Particle Duality? The Statistical 
Interpretation of the Copenhagen School 
When de Broglie ﬁrst proposed the wave-particle duality of electrons in 1924, most 
scientists were skeptical about it. But with the results of Davisson and Thomson’s 
electron diffraction experiments, it became widely accepted that electrons have the 
properties of waves. In 1926, Schrödinger published his famous quantum wave equa-
tion for the electron, which is highly successful in explaining the structure of atoms 
and many other microscopic properties of physical systems [18]. The wave function 
(ψ) in the Schrödinger equation is called the “matter wave”. Then, it became a big 
challenge for physicists to explain what the physical meaning of the matter wave is. 
How can one connect the concept of “matter wave” with the presence of the electron? 
In 1927, a group of physicists working at the Copenhagen University (including 
Bohr and Heisenberg) proposed an explanation for the physical meaning of matter 
waves [19, 20]. They suggested that the electron itself is a point-mass-like particle, 
but its distribution could appear in the form of a wave. Therefore, the so-called 
“matter wave” is not a real wave, but a “probability wave”; it mainly reﬂects the 
probability of the particle appearing at a certain time and location. 
According to this statistical point of view, the wave function (ψ) in the Schrödinger 
equation is directly related to the probability of an electron appearing at certain time 
and position. More speciﬁcally, they argue that the square of the absolute value of 
the wave function represents the probability of a particular electron appearing in a 
certain space–time position: 
The probability of an electron appearing at a certain space–time = StartAbsoluteValue psi left parenthesis x comma t right parenthesis EndAbsoluteValue squared. 
Here x is the position and t is the time. The leader of this theory was Bohr (see 
Fig. 4.4). In 1918, he founded an Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of 
Copenhagen (later called the “Niels Bohr Institute”). The institute began operating in 
1921, and Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. His institute attracted 
many quantum physicists to visit and work there. Therefore, their interpretation of 
matter waves was known as the “Copenhagen Interpretation”.
4.2.1 
Debates on the Probabilistic Interpretations 
The Copenhagen interpretation subsequently became the mainstream theory in 
quantum mechanics. In fact, the interpretation of the Copenhagen School was later 
given a philosophical extension. It seemed to imply that the microscopic world is a

theory. Photo Credit: Photograph by A. B. Lagrelius and Westphal, courtesy AIP Emilio Segrè

probabilistic world; everything is uncertain. In theory, a microscopic system can have 
several possible states; the quantum state is just a superposition of these different 
states. The result obtained from a quantum mechanical calculation simply gives the 
probabilities of ﬁnding the various states. The physical state of a system can only be 
determined when one conducts an experiment to measure a certain physical property 
of the system. 
The Copenhagen School basically looked at electrons from a particle point of 
view. While their interpretation of the quantum wave function succeeded in giving 
a plausible explanation for matter waves, not all scientists accepted it. Some promi-
nent physicists have expressed doubts about the probabilistic world implied by this 
Copenhagen interpretation [21]. Some scientists believe that matter waves should be 
real waves with physical properties, not just an elusive probability. 
Einstein had always been skeptical of the concept of probability waves. He has a 
famous saying “God does not throw dice”[22], which is a criticism of the Copenhagen 
interpretation. Another well-known physicist, Schrödinger, was also not satisﬁed 
with the statistical probability explanation advocated by the Copenhagen School. As 
the inventor of the quantum wave equation for electrons, he has always been interested 
in what the physical nature of matter waves is. In the 1930s, he had several exchanges 
with Einstein on this topic. In 1935, Einstein proposed a thought experiment using 
“gunpowder” as an example in a letter to Schrödinger [6]. Imagine there is a stack 
of gunpowder, some of which are unstable and could cause an explosion. If we use 
a quantum mechanical equation to represent this state, according to the Copenhagen 
interpretation, the state represented by the wave function is just a superposition of 
several probabilities. So, for this pile of gunpowder, does its wave function include 
both the part of the gunpowder that hasn’t exploded and the part of the gunpowder that 
has already exploded? This is impossible in reality. “Because in reality gunpowder 
cannot exist in an intermediate state between exploded and unexploded” [6].

Quantum mechanics has been continuously developed and applied in modern 
times; its success is beyond doubt. But controversy over the interpretation of quantum 
wave functions has not stopped. Is the matter wave a real physical wave or just a 
probabilistic wave? What is the physical meaning of the quantum wave function? 
Even today, scientists are still trying to come up with different ideas to answer those 
questions. 
4.3 
Evidence Suggesting that the Electron is a Physical 
Wave 
4.3.1 
Why Do We Think Elementary Particles Are Waves? 
At present, we know at least one elementary particle (photon) is a physical wave. 
From the Maxwell theory, we know the photon is an oscillation of the EM ﬁeld; it 
is a quantized wave packet. For visible light waves, their wavelength is from 400 to 
700 nm. Since the size of a wave packet must span over multiple wavelengths, this 
means the width of a photon is quite large (>10 microns). The photon is clearly not 
a point-like object. 
Is the electron a point-like object or a wave? In many ways, an electron behaves 
just like a photon. Such similarities between electrons and photons had been recog-
nized by many physicists. For example, according to Richard Feynman: “…electrons 
behave just like light. The quantum behavior of atomic objects … is the same for all, 
they are all ‘particle waves,’…so what we learn about the properties of electrons… 
will apply also to all ‘particles,’ including photons of light” [16]. 
A large amount of experimental evidence had indicated that the electron has wave 
properties. For example, as we have discussed in the above, electrons can be diffracted 
by a crystal following the Bragg’s Law [8]. If the electron is a point-like object, it can 
only bounce from one atom in the crystal and thus should not form an interference 
pattern following the Bragg’s Law. Furthermore, it is known that a single electron 
can pass through two near-by slits to give an interference pattern [17]. How can a 
point-like electron do that? If the electron is really a corpuscular object, it can only 
pass one of the slits at one time and thus could never form an interference pattern. 
According to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, the length of the elec-
tron orbit within an atom must equal to an integral number of electron wavelength 
[21]. This suggests that the electron inside an atom is a resonating wave. Further-
more, if the electron is a point-like object, the atom will be vastly empty. How can an 
atom behave like a hard sphere? Also, how can the point-like electrons hold atoms 
together to form molecules? Can a “probability wave” form chemical bonds between 
atoms and hold them together? 
The only logical explanation is that the electron must be a wave in nature. It should 
be a physical wave instead of probability wave. In fact, it is this wave property of the 
electron that allows us to build an electron microscope [23–25]. If the electron is a

51
corpuscular object and its wave property is only associated with a “probability” of its 
distribution, how can one explain the principle of a transmitting electron microscope? 
Another strong reason for us to believe that the electron is a wave is the fact that 
an electron can be created or annihilated in the vacuum. It is well known in quantum 
electrodynamics that an electron–positron pair can be created by an energetic photon. 
Conversely, an electron and a positron can be annihilated to give a photon. It is very 
difﬁcult to explain these observations, if one regards the electron as a massive point 
object. On the other hand, such observations can be explained very easily if one 
believes that the electrons (and the positrons) are excitation waves of the vacuum. 
Finally, not only de Broglie’s relation, all quantum relations of photon, including 
Planck’s relation and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principles, are also shown to be appli-
cable to massive particles. This implies that particles with or without masses are the 
same thing; that is, they are quantized physical waves! 
4.4 
Hints from the Collider Experiments: How Can 
Particles Be Created from Nowhere? 
In modern physics, many sub-atomic particles (including electrons, neutrons, and 
alpha particles) were ﬁrst discovered through the study of different types of radiation. 
Later, many new particles were discovered in collider experiments. Starting from 
the 1930s, scientists started to use accelerators to accelerate particles to very high 
speeds and bombard them with a target [26]. Later, these accelerated particles were 
directed to collide with each other. Using some highly sophisticated detectors, the 
collision products can be analyzed in detail. Occasionally, some new particles could 
be discovered from these collision products (see Fig. 4.5). 
Fig. 4.5 Schematic representation of the collider experiment. Scientists use accelerators to 
accelerate particles to very high speeds and then direct them to collide with each other. Special 
detectors are used to analyze the material produced after the collision. In this example, the colliding 
particles are protons

The Merging of the Particle and Wave Concepts: Evidence Suggesting …
The original idea behind these collider experiments was very simple. It was 
designed to ﬁnd out what the particle is made of. Suppose an alien (“superman”) 
comes to Earth for the ﬁrst time and he sees cars running on the road, but he doesn’t 
know what cars are made of. He could use his super power to accelerate two cars to 
a high speed, and then make them collide with each other. After the cars crashed, 
many parts will fall out. By analyzing the fallout parts, the alien could roughly 
ﬁgure out what are the basic materials that make up cars on Earth. The experimental 
particle physicists had a similar idea; they used particle colliders to smash one type 
of particle against another type of particle, and hope to ﬁnd out the particle’s building 
blocks from the debris. In the past few decades, they had indeed found a lot of useful 
experimental results from the products of particle collisions, allowing us to know the 
composition of some particles (see Fig. 4.6).
However, this method of analyzing parts by smashing an object into pieces has 
practical limits. In many more recent particle collision experiments, the interpreta-
tion of the results is far more complicated than the above-mentioned car collision 
experiment. In fact, we found a very strange phenomenon, that is, after two particles 
collide, it will produce many new species of particles whose rest masses are much 
larger than the original particles. This is as if that, when the alien mentioned above 
collided two cars, he found that the objects coming out were not car parts; instead, 
the fallout objects are very big and far heavier than the cars. For example, such fallout 
objects could be heavy tanks, ﬁghter jets, etc. (see Fig. 4.7).
Particle physicists today are facing the same problem. Why did particle collision 
produce particles of new species with far greater masses than the original particles? 
Where do these new particles come from? 
To answer this question, physicists basically have two choices: (1) the new parti-
cles already exist in the vacuum beforehand; (2) all particles are excitation waves of 
the vacuum; when energy is applied to the vacuum, new waves can be generated. 
Traditionally, most particle physicists seem to favor the ﬁrst explanation. For 
example, the ﬁrst theory to predict the existence of anti-particles for electrons 
is Dirac’s electron theory, which assumed the existence of an inﬁnite number of 
negative-energy electrons in space [27, 28]. (This scenario is called the “Dirac ocean” 
of negative-energy electrons.) When a photon (such as a gamma ray) hits this “ocean”, 
it excites a negative-energy electron to become a positive-energy electron, which can 
move freely. This creates a hole in the negative-energy state. This hole would behave 
like an anti-particle of the electron (i.e., positron). In other words, the positron is 
just a hole in the Dirac’s ocean of the negative-energy electron. Particle physicists 
of the past have relied on this theory to explain why photons can create a pair of 
electron and positron in the vacuum. The same theory can be used to explain how 
new particles are created in the collider experiment. 
This theory, however, has certain problems. First, the vacuum in this theory is very 
complicated; the vacuum must be ﬁlled with an inﬁnite number of negative-energy 
electrons. These negative-energy electrons cannot be directly observed. 
Second, there are not only electrons in our world, but also many other elementary 
particles. If one uses Dirac’s negative-energy electron ocean theory to explain the 
origin of all these particles, then the vacuum must be ﬁlled with an inﬁnite number

Fig. 4.6 Metaphor of the 
principle of the collider 
experiment. The analogy in 
the design of the particle 
collider experiment is similar 
to that of colliding two cars 
to learn what parts a car is 
made of
of all kinds of negative-energy elementary particles, including all kinds of fermions. 
The vacuum becomes a very crowded place. Furthermore, the Dirac theory cannot 
explain why bosons have anti-particles; the bosons do not obey Pauli’s exclusion 
principle, and thus, their energy levels cannot be fully occupied. 
To avoid these problems, particle physicists later developed the quantum ﬁeld 
theory, which provides a new explanation for the creation of particles in the vacuum. 
They propose that there are countless “virtual particles” in the vacuum in a very short 
time scale [29]. Usually, you can’t see or touch these virtual particles, but when the 
vacuum is excited, some of these virtual particles could transform into real particles

Fig. 4.7 Puzzling result of 
the collider experiment. 
Surprising results of the 
collider experiment. In the 
particle collision experiment, 
when the colliding particles 
are accelerated to very high 
energy, the collision will 
produce a variety of new 
species of particles whose 
masses are much larger than 
the original particles. This is 
like when two cars collide 
against each other, objects 
that appear after the collision 
are not car parts, but new 
objects much heavier than 
the original car. It is 
impossible to explain such a 
ﬁnding using the 
conventional particle view
and appear in space. However, it remains unexplained why nature should be ﬁlled 
with unlimited numbers of various kinds of virtual particles. 
By comparison, the conceptual picture of the wave model is far simpler. If 
we regard all particles (including particles and anti-particles of different mass) as 
different excitation waves of the vacuum, there is no need to assume the pre-existence 
of an inﬁnite number of particles occupying the negative-energy states (or virtual 
particles) [30]. Furthermore, from the wave model, one can see that different species

4.5 The Idea of Solitons
55
of particles are just different excitation modes of the same vacuum. This can simply 
explain why particles can be converted from one species to another. 
4.5 
The Idea of Solitons 
In the quantum wave model discussed above, the quantum particle is regarded as 
an excitation wave of the vacuum medium; it behaves like a “particle” only at a 
macroscopic view. The idea that a wave can behave like a particle is not totally 
new. For example, in the ﬁeld of particle physics, many people are engaged in the 
research of solitons. Their aim is to develop various physical or mathematical models 
that could generate some speciﬁc “waves” that could mimic traveling “particles”. 
The idea of solitons was inspired by the observations that a wave sometimes could 
behave as a non-dissipating traveling object. For example, in a certain river or water 
channel, one can observe some of the tidal waves that could travel in a long distance 
without being dispersed. Similarly, in some of the topological mechanical systems, 
one can also observe traveling waves that are commonly referred to as “solitons”. 
The soliton phenomenon was ﬁrst described in 1834 by a Scottish engineer, John 
Russell, who observed a solitary wave in the Union Canal in Scotland [31]. He 
later reproduced a similar phenomenon in a wave tank. In modern days, the soliton 
phenomenon has inspired many physicists to come up with speciﬁc mathematical or 
physical models to mimic a particle with a wave packet. The crucial step is to propose 
a speciﬁc form of nonlinear wave equation that can counter-act the dispersion effect 
of the wave medium, so that the shape of the wave packet could be maintained when 
the wave packet travels a long distance. 
In most cases, solitons are the solutions of a widespread class of weakly nonlinear 
dispersive partial differential equations describing a chosen physical system. In many 
physical models, one could develop a wave equation that has soliton solutions. Some 
known cases include the Korteweg-De Vries equation, the nonlinear Schrödinger 
equation, and the sine–Gordon equation [32–35]. 
Another way to maintain the soliton stability is to impose certain topological 
constraints, such that the solution of the wave equation is limited in such a form that 
the wave packet cannot be widely dispersed. In this class of solitons, the constraints 
arise mainly because the solution of the wave equations must obey a set of speciﬁc 
boundary conditions. 
We believe the research on solitons and the quantum wave model discussed here 
could share the same philosophical approach. Both of their works are based on the 
thinking that the physical nature of the quantum particle is a wave. The challenge 
now is to ﬁnd out what are the physical properties of the wave medium and what are 
the mechanisms for making the excitation wave in a non-disperse state.

Chapter Summary 
• In the early 1920s, it was discovered that a massive particle (e.g., an electron) 
can behave like a wave. This discovery was mainly due to a bold hypothesis 
put forward by de Broglie. He proposed that not only waves can have particle 
properties. Particles with mass might also have wave properties. 
• This hypothesis was soon conﬁrmed in experiments. Davisson and Germer 
reported that the electron diffraction results were similar to that obtained by 
diffraction using X-rays. Their ﬁndings suggested that electrons have wave 
properties as proposed by de Broglie. 
• The double-slit experiment also demonstrated that the electron behaves like a 
wave. The most amazing thing about this experiment is that the generation of the 
interference fringes does not come from interference between different electrons, 
but an electron itself can interfere with itself. 
• How to explain wave-particle duality? In 1927, a group of physicists working at 
Copenhagen University proposed an explanation. They suggested that the electron 
itself is a point-mass-like particle, but its distribution could appear in the form of a 
wave. Therefore, the so-called “matter wave” is not a real wave, but a “probability 
wave”; it mainly reﬂects the probability of the particle appearing at a certain time 
and location. 
• Many physicists did not agree with the statistical interpretation of the Copenhagen 
school. A large amount of experimental evidence had indicated that the electron 
has wave properties (including the electron diffraction experiment and the double-
slit experiment). Besides that, according to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization 
condition, the length of the electron orbit within an atom must equal an integral 
number of electron wavelength, suggesting that the electron inside an atom must 
behave like a resonating wave. 
• Another strong reason to believe that the electron is a physical wave is the fact 
that an electron can be created or annihilated in the vacuum. It is very difﬁcult to 
explain these observations if one regards the electron as a massive point object. 
On the other hand, such observations can be explained very easily if one believes 
that the electron is an excitation wave of the vacuum.

Wave Excitation in the Vacuum: What are 
the Physical Properties of Matter Wave?

Chapter 5 
The Mechanism of Wave Excitation 
and the Physical Nature of the Vacuum 
Medium 
As stated above, we believe that a quantum particle (such as an electron) is an 
excitation wave in the microscopic view; it behaves like a point object only in the 
macroscopic view. We will show in the following that the quantum wave equation 
for the electron can be naturally derived if we treat the electron as an excitation wave 
of the vacuum. Our approach is to regard quantum mechanics as a natural extension 
of classical physics. We will ﬁrst review the physical basis of wave excitation in 
a mechanical system (such as a ﬂexible string or an elastic solid). We will show 
that the equation of motion for the excitation wave is entirely dependent on the 
physical properties of the medium. Then, we will analyze the wave mechanism in 
the vacuum system. The key questions are: What are the physical properties of the 
vacuum medium? Can we derive the equation of motion based on the vacuum’s 
physical properties? Finally, can this approach lead us to derive the correct quantum 
wave equations for the matter wave? 
5.1 
Useful Analogy: Wave Propagation in a Classical 
Mechanical System 
To study the physical meaning of the wave function, let us ﬁrst review what happens 
in a classical mechanical system. Here, the basic requirement for generating a wave 
motion involves two types of forces: (a) Inertial force, which is related to the change 
of momentum and thus the kinetic energy; (b) Restoring force, which is related to the 
change of the potential energy. The inertial force is basically described by Newton’s 
second Law: F = ma. The restoring force is generally described by Hooke’s Law: 
upp er F equals minus kappa x. It is the interaction between these two forces that generates an oscillation 
in a mechanical system. In the following, we will brieﬂy review three different cases 
as examples. From these examples, one can see clearly the physical meaning of the 
wave function.

5.1.1 
Wave in a Harmonic Oscillator 
The simplest example of wave generation in a mechanical system is the one-
dimensional harmonic oscillator. One can easily set up the equation of motion by 
equalizing the inertial force with the restoring force. Using Newton’s Law, we know 
upper F equals m a equals m StartFraction d squared x Over d t squared EndFraction period

where om ega equals StartRoot kappa divided by m EndRoot √omega equals StartRoot kappa divided by m EndRoot. In this case, the wave function apparently represents the 
displacement in the harmonic oscillator. 
5.1.2 
Wave Propagation in a One-Dimensional String 
In the above example, the solution of the wave equation is not a moving wave. Thus, 
it is not a proper example to demonstrate the generation of a propagating wave. 
The simplest example to demonstrate wave propagation in a mechanical system is a 
one-dimensional stretched string. 
This string can be modeled as a string of beads, in which the mass of one segment 
of the string (Δz) is lumped together to become a bead. (See Fig. 5.1a). Each pair 
of neighboring beads is then connected by a massless string. The beads can undergo 
harmonic oscillation. The wave propagating along the string is generated by coupling 
the harmonic oscillation of neighboring beads.
Using such a simpliﬁed model, one can easily describe the wave propagating 
mechanism. First, the inertial motion of each bead is governed by the Newton’s law. 
Second, the restoring force is governed by the Hooke’s law, which is applied to the 
string connecting two neighboring beads. These two forces interact with each other 
to allow the wave to travel along the string.

(a stretched string). a The 
wave propagation on a string 
can be modelled as coupled 
harmonic oscillations of a 
string of beads. b In the more 
reﬁned model, each “bead” 
becomes a tiny segment of 
the string. Credit: This ﬁgure 
is reproduced from an earlier 
publication of the author: 
D. C. Chang, arXiv preprint 
physics/0505010v2 (2017)
In this system, it is more convenient to derive the equation of motion using the 
Lagrangian formulation. (See Appendix B). Instead of describing the system using 
the (position and velocity) coordinates of each bead, one can describe the motion of 
the string using a “basic ﬁeld” concept. 
From Newton’s Law, we know the kinetic energy of a small segment of the string 
(length of Δz) is nor ma l upper Delta upper T equals one half left parenthesis rho normal upper Delta z right parenthesis v squared
norm al upper Delta upper T equals one half left parenthesis rho normal upper Delta z right parenthesis v squared, where ρ is the mass density of the string. Let 
us denote the vertical displacement of the string as phi, which is the basic ﬁeld of this 
system; the kinetic energy is

In this case, the wave function apparently represents the transverse displacement 
of the string. 
5.2 
Wave Propagation in a 3-Dimensional Elastic Solid 
In the above example, the wave function is a direct representation of the movement of 
the wave medium. In a more complex mechanical system, however, it is sometimes 
more convenient to use the potential functions (which indirectly describes the move-
ment of the wave medium) as the wave function. Such a process can be accomplished 
with the use of the Helmholtz decomposition theorem (see Appendix C). 
As an example, let us consider the mechanism of wave propagation in a 3-
dimensional elastic solid. Here, we will denote the displacement and velocity ﬁelds 
of a differential solid element (normal upper Delta upper V ) as  ri and ui (i = 1, 2, 3). From Newton’s Law, 
the time derivative of the momentum (density ρ × velocity vector ui) is equal to the 
surface/traction force T i and the body force f i applied [1, 2],

traction force T i is known to be related to the second-order stress tensor σ ij, i.e., T i 
= σij nj, where n = {ni} is the normal unit vector with respect to the surface S [1]. 
It can be shown that [3]

These wave equations have a similar form as the vibrating string as shown in 
Eq. (5.8). The meanings of the wave functions, however, are slightly different. In the 
case of the 1-D string, the wave function represents a transverse displacement of the 
string. But in the case of an elastic solid, the wave functions φ and ψ do not directly 
represent the displacement of the solid element. Instead, they represent potential 
functions, the derivatives of which are related to different modes of displacement 
according to the Helmholtz decomposition.

Mechanism of Wave Excitation in the Vacuum Medium 
Now, let us examine the mechanism of wave propagation in the vacuum system. 
In the above, we reviewed the wave propagation mechanisms in the mechanical 
system. It is clear that the mechanical waves are clearly physical waves, i.e., their 
wave function represents a physical movement of its wave medium. In quantum 
mechanics, particles with mass are known to exhibit some wave properties. The 
wave associated with an electron is called “matter wave” [7]. It has been debated on 
whether this matter wave is a physical wave or not. In the early parts of this book, 
we had presented experimental evidence indicating that the electron is an excitation 
wave of the vacuum; so, the matter wave should be a physical wave. 
From the above section, it is clear that the equation of motion for the excitation 
wave in a mechanical system is entirely determined by the physical properties of the 
medium. Now, if the matter wave of an electron is an excitation wave of the vacuum 
system, what are the physical properties of the vacuum medium? Can we derive 
the proper equation of motion for the matter wave based on the vacuum’s physical 
properties? 
5.3.1 
How does Wave Propagate in the Vacuum? 
Based on the above discussion, it appears that one might model the vacuum as an 
elastic solid. Such attempts had been made previously and some interesting results 
were reported [3, 8–10]. We, however, decided to take a different approach. This

decision was based on two considerations. First, the hint from the photon. Second, 
the lack of proper mechanical properties in the vacuum. Unlike the elastic solid, 
Newton’s law and Hooke’s law cannot be applied in the vacuum medium. Since the 
vacuum has no rest mass, there is no inertial force. Furthermore, there is no restoring 
force because there is no mechanical coupling between the neighboring volume 
elements of the vacuum. Thus, it is extremely difﬁcult to set up a wave equation like 
the Navier equation in the vacuum. 
Then, the vacuum system must use a different mechanism to generate a propa-
gating wave. To ﬁnd out such a mechanism, we followed the hint of a photon. It is 
well known that electromagnetic wave can propagate in the vacuum. By studying 
how the electromagnetic wave is driven, we will be able to gain some insight about 
the wave propagation mechanism in the vacuum system. 
For the electro-magnetic wave, the wave regenerating mechanism is entirely based 
on the Maxwell’s equations, more speciﬁcally, the Ampere’s law and the Faraday’s 
law.

This shows that E and H can cross interact with each other in the vacuum. When 
E changes with time, it generate a change in curl H in the vicinity; and when H 
changes with time, it would induce E around it to change. This cross interaction 
allows the electro-magnetic wave to propagate in the vacuum. 
Hence, it seems that there is a close analogy between the wave-generating mech-
anism in the mechanical system and that in the electro-magnetic system. In the 
mechanical system, it is the interactions between the general coordinate (q) and the

What is the Physical Nature of the Vacuum? The Aether 
Hypothesis 
From the above discussions, we have some ideas about the wave generating mech-
anism in the vacuum for the electromagnetic wave. However, it is not clear whether 
the same mechanism works for the matter wave. First, we have not yet identiﬁed the 
basic ﬁeld for the matter wave; we do not think the electric or magnetic ﬁelds are 
the proper basic ﬁeld. Second, we know very little about the physical nature of the 
vacuum medium. Unlike those cases in the mechanical systems (such as the stretched 
string or elastic solid), it is not possible to associate any wave function with the local 
movement of the wave medium in the vacuum system. 
The physical nature of the vacuum is a controversial topic in the study of physics. 
Historically, the perception of vacuum changed with time. In classical mechanics, 
the vacuum is regarded as an empty space, with nothing inside it. This view is based 
on the fact that a mechanical object free of applied force can move in straight line at a 
constant speed. There is nothing in the vacuum that can impede such a motion. But at 
later time, with the discovery of the electro-magnetic ﬁeld, many physicists started to

The Mechanism of Wave Excitation and the Physical Nature …
Fig. 5.2 Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1928) was a famous theoretical physicist in the Netherlands. 
He was a major contributor to the aether hypothesis. He derived the “Lorentz transformation” to 
connect the space–time coordinates in two inertial frames. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 
Physics in 1902 for his work explaining magnetic effects in atomic spectroscopy. Photo Credit: AIP

assume that there must be a medium that carries the electro-magnetic radiation. This 
medium is called “aether”, which is supposed to occupy all space between matter 
[11]. The basic thinking was that, in order for any wave to propagate, a medium is 
required. Since it had been demonstrated that light is a wave, there must be a carrying 
medium for it. 
The Aether hypothesis was a widely accepted physical theory during the eigh-
teenth and nineteenth century. (For details, see Appendix A). Many well-known 
physicists and mathematicians, including Faraday, Helmholtz, Maxwell, Stokes, 
Cauchy, Poisson, Gauss, Riemann, and Lorentz (see Fig. 5.2), had made contributions 
to such a theory [11]. 
The idea of aether was clearly summarized by Maxwell at the end of his famous 
book: A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, Vol. 1: 
We have seen that the mathematical expressions for electrodynamic action led, in the mind 
of Gauss, to the conviction that a theory of the propagation of electric action in time would 
be found to be the very key-stone of electrodynamics. Now we are unable to conceive of 
propagation in time, except either as the ﬂight of a material substance through space, or 
as the propagation of a condition of motion or stress in a medium already existing in 
space…. 
But in all of these theories the question naturally occurs:—If something is transmitted from 
one particle to another at a distance, what is its condition after it has left the one particle 
and before it has reached the other? If this something is the potential energy of the two 
particles, as in Neumann’s theory, how are we to conceive this energy as existing in a point 
of space, coinciding neither with the one particle nor with the other? In fact, whenever energy 
is transmitted from one body to another in time, there must be a medium or substance in 
which the energy exists after it leaves one body and before it reaches the other, for energy, 
as Torricelli remarked, ‘is a quintessence of so subtile a nature that it cannot be contained in 
any vessel except the inmost substance of material things’. Hence all these theories lead to 
the conception of a medium in which the propagation takes place, and if we admit this 
medium as an hypothesis, I think it ought to occupy a prominent place in our investigations. 
[12]

5.5 Evidence Indicating that the Vacuum is Not an Empty Space
71
The aether hypothesis, however, was later disfavored. That was because it had 
many serious problems. The most severe one was its inconsistency with experimental 
observations. In late nineteenth century, many scientists attempted to use optical 
interferometers to detect the movement between aether and the Earth. The most 
famous one was the Michelson-Morley experiment [13]. None of such measurements 
was able to detect any movement between Earth and the hypothetical aether. 
Furthermore, the aether hypothesis was later thought to be unnecessary. In 1905, 
Einstein proposed the Special Theory of Relativity (STR) and showed that one can 
explain the null results easily without the assumption of aether [14]. So, this aether 
hypothesis was totally abandoned in the early twentieth century. 
5.5 
Evidence Indicating that the Vacuum is Not an Empty 
Space 
The disfavoring of the aether hypothesis, however, does not imply that the vacuum 
is proven to be an empty space. In the more recent development of modern 
physics, including the emerging works of quantum mechanics, particle physics and 
cosmology, the view of regarding the vacuum as an empty space is clearly unaccept-
able. For example, in quantum electrodynamics, every oscillation mode of radiation 
is supposed to have a zero-point energy [7]. Such energy is assumed to be a part of 
the vacuum system. In fact, in the quantum ﬁeld theory, the vacuum is just regarded 
as the ground state of the quantum system [15]. An empty vacuum is not consistent 
with the current theories of quantum physics. “The quantum theory asserts that a 
vacuum, even the most perfect vacuum devoid of any matter, is not really empty. 
Rather, the quantum vacuum can be depicted as a sea of continuously appearing and 
disappearing [pairs of] particles that manifest themselves in the apparent jostling 
of particles that is quite distinct from their thermal motions. These particles are 
‘virtual’, as opposed to real, particles. …At any given instant, the vacuum is full of 
such virtual pairs”. [16] 
In the Standard Model of cosmology today, the vacuum has even more complicated 
features; the presence of our entire universe is supposed to come from the quantum 
ﬂuctuations of the vacuum [17]. 
Finally, the idea of a non-empty vacuum is well supported in experiments. For 
example, the interaction between the vacuum and the electron was demonstrated in 
the famous experiment of Lamb shift [18]. In the Dirac theory, the energy levels of 
2S1/2 and 2P1/2 of a hydrogen atom are degenerate [19]. There should be no energy 
shift between them. But if the vacuum is not empty, the vacuum energy ﬂuctuations 
can interact with the electrons in different orbitals. It would cause a very small 
energy shift. Such a shift was detected by Lamb and Retherford in 1947 [18]. In 
fact, the experimental value of this “Lamb shift” agreed well with the calculation of 
H. A. Bethe, who applied Kramers’ idea of mass renormalization to account for the 
interactions between a free electron and the radiation ﬁeld [19]. The Lamb shift has

72

since played a signiﬁcant role in demonstrating the importance of including vacuum 
energy ﬂuctuations in theoretical calculations. 
In addition to the Lamb shift, non-empty properties of the vacuum were also 
demonstrated in several other types of experiments, including spontaneous emission, 
vacuum polarization and the Casimir effect [20–22]. Today, we can no longer treat the 
vacuum as emptiness, although its physical properties are still not well understood or 
agreed upon. In fact, understanding the physical properties of the vacuum is a very 
important topic in modern physics today; it is currently under active investigation 
[3, 23–26]. 
In this work, we will simply regard the vacuum as a wave medium, the excitation 
wave of which will appear as elementary particles. This vacuum medium can be 
regarded as a modernized quantum model of the classical aether hypothesis. The 
major differences between this vacuum medium and the original aether concept are 
that, 
(1) Not only radiation wave (photons) is the excitation of the vacuum, matter waves 
(quantum waves representing massive particles) are also excitation waves of the 
same vacuum. 
(2) The excitation wave of the vacuum medium is quantized, so that the emission 
and absorption of the excitation wave obeys the principle of all-or-none. 
(3) The excitation wave representing a massive particle satisﬁes the same quantum 
wave relations of a photon, including the Planck’s relation, the de Broglie 
relation, and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle. 
The physical properties of this vacuum medium will be discussed in detail in the 
next Chapter. 
5.6 
Chapter Summary 
• We propose that a quantum particle (such as an electron) is a quantized excitation 
wave of the vacuum. To understand the wave excitation mechanism, we start by 
reviewing the mechanism of wave excitation in a classical mechanical system 
(such as a ﬂexible string or an elastic solid). It is evident that the equation of 
motion for the excitation wave is entirely determined by the physical properties 
of the medium. 
• To generate a wave motion in a mechanical system, two types of forces are 
needed:(a)Inertial force, which is related to the change of momentum and thus the 
kinetic energy; (b) Restoring force, which is related to the change of the potential 
energy. The inertial force is basically described by Newton’s second Law. The  
restoring force is described by a generalized Hooke’s Law. Interaction between 
these two forces can generate an oscillation in a mechanical system. 
• In the case of the 1-D string, the wave function represents a transverse displace-
ment of the string. But in the case of a 3-D elastic solid, the wave functions φ and 
ψ do not directly represent the displacement of the solid element. Instead, they

represent potential functions, the derivatives of which are related to different 
modes of displacement according to the Helmholtz decomposition theorem. 
• Unlike mechanical systems, the vacuum system uses a different mechanism 
to generate a propagating wave. In the mechanical system, it is the connection 
between the general coordinate (q) and the general momentum (p) as described in 
Newton’s Law and Hooke’s Law that generates an oscillating wave. The vacuum 
system, on the other hand, relies on the cross interactions between the electric 
ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld H to generate a propagating electro-magnetic wave. 
• The physical nature of the vacuum is a controversial topic in physics. In classical 
mechanics, the vacuum was regarded as an empty space. But with the discovery 
of the electro-magnetic ﬁeld, physicists realized that there must be a medium 
for carrying the electro-magnetic radiation. This medium was called “aether”, 
which is supposed to occupy all space between matters [11]. The Aether hypoth-
esis was a widely accepted physical theory during the eighteenth and nineteenth 
century. (For details, see Appendix A). Many well-known physicists and mathe-
maticians, including Maxwell, Faraday, Lorentz, Gauss, and Riemann, had made 
contributions to such a theory. 
• In the fundamental studies of modern physics, including quantum ﬁeld theory, 
particle physics, and cosmology, the vacuum is not regarded as an empty space. 
In fact, the idea of a non-empty vacuum is well supported in experiments. For  
example, the interaction between vacuum and electron was clearly demonstrated 
in the famous experiment of Lamb shift [18]. In addition, non-empty properties of 
vacuum were also demonstrated in several other types of experiments, including 
spontaneous emission, vacuum polarization, and the Casimir effect.

Potential Z 
At present, our knowledge about the quantum vacuum is still limited. In the nineteenth 
century, it was widely believed that the space between matters is ﬁlled with a medium 
called “aether”. The aether hypothesis, however, had some serious difﬁculties and 
thus became disfavored later (For a more detailed discussion of the aether hypothesis, 
please see Appendix A). Nevertheless, the disfavoring of the aether hypothesis does 
not mean that the vacuum is an empty space. Many recent studies suggested that the 
vacuum must have speciﬁc physical properties. Our proposal of the vacuum being a 
wave medium is not a simple revival of the classical aether hypothesis. Instead, we 
are aiming to develop a new theory of quantum vacuum which will accommodate 
the major features of the Maxwell theory, the special theory of relativity, and the key 
concepts of quantum physics. 
There are fundamental differences between our model of quantum vacuum and 
the traditional aether hypothesis. First, the  aether was a hypothetical medium ﬁlling 
only the space between matters. Our concept of vacuum, on the other hand, is a pre-
existing medium that ﬁlls the entire space of the universe. Second, the aether was 
assumed to be a medium for carrying the electromagnetic waves only. In this work, 
we propose that all particles found in nature (with or without rest mass) are excitation 
waves of the same quantum vacuum. Finally, our quantum vacuum hypothesis can 
avoid the known problems of the aether hypothesis (For details, see Appendix A). 
6.1 Physical Nature of the Vacuum: Implications 
from the Maxwell Theory 
A key challenge in this work is to determine the physical properties of the quantum 
vacuum. We discovered an important hint from the work of a great physicist, James 
Maxwell (see Fig. 6.1). That is, the Maxwell theory appears to have a hidden assump-
tion; namely, the vacuum should behave like a dielectric medium (see below). This

The Vacuum is a Dielectric Medium According to the Maxwell Theory …
Fig. 6.1 James Clerk Maxwell. James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) was a Scottish physicist who 
developed the modern theory of electromagnetism. The Maxwell theory provides the foundation of 
electrodynamics and has very profound inﬂuence in physics and engineering. Einstein described 
Maxwell’s work as the “most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the 
time of Newton”. Photo Credit: digitized from an engraving by G. J. Stodart from a photograph by

is a very important discovery which had been overlooked by most physicists today. 
Thus, let us have a careful review of Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory in detail. 
6.1.1 Implication of Maxwell’s Introduction of the Electric 
Displacement Concept 
It is well known that a major contribution of Maxwell was his introduction of the 
electric displacement D into electrodynamics [1–3]. His original purpose to do so 
was to make Ampère’s Law consistent with the condition of charge conservation [4]. 
In the nineteenth century, the original Ampère’s Law was 
n a bla tim
es bold upper H equals bold upper J comma
where J is the electric current density and H is the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding it. 
This equation had a problem; it is not consistent with the condition of conservation 
of charge, 
n a bla d ot bold upper J equals minus StartFraction partial differential rho Subscript e Baseline Over partial differential t EndFraction period
nab l
a dot bold upper J equals minus StartFraction partial differential rho Subscript e Baseline Over partial differential t EndFraction period
In order to ﬁx this problem, Maxwell proposed to add a new term pa
r
tial differential bold upper D divided by partial differential t into 
the right-hand side of Eq. (6.1), where D is called “electric displacement” which is 
proportional to the electric ﬁeld E, i.e.,

bold up

His argument was that: When an external electric ﬁeld is applied to a dielectric 
medium, it will cause a displacement of the dielectric charges [1, 4]. The time deriva-
tive of these displaced charges would produce a displacement current (pa
r

should be included into the Ampère’s Law, i.e., 
n a bla times bold upper H equals bold upper J plus StartFraction partial differential bold upper D Over partial differential t EndFraction period
nabl
a times bold upper H equals bold upper J plus StartFraction partial differential bold upper D Over partial differential t EndFraction period
Now, the revised Ampère’s Law (Eq. 6.4) will be consistent with the condition of 
charge conservation (i.e., Eq. 6.2). In the literature, D sometimes is called “electric 
induction”, since it mirrors the magnetic induction B, which is proportional to the 
magnetic ﬁeld H, i.e., 
bo ld up
per B equals mu bold upper H period
(In the above equations, ε and μ are the dielectric permittivity and magnetic 
permeability, respectively. In the vacuum, mu equa l s mu 0 comma epsilon equals epsilon 0) 
This revised Ampère’s Law was included in the ﬁnal form of the Maxwell’s 
equations. Later, Oliver Heaviside used vector calculus to further simplify them into 
four equations [5], which are

6.1.2 Maxwell’s Theory of Light Propagation Implied That 
the Vacuum is a Dielectric Medium 
When Maxwell used his equations to construct the theory of light propagation, he 
assumed that the external current vanishes in the vacuum, (i.e., J = 0), but the 
displacement current (pa
r
tial differential bold upper D divided by partial differential t) does not vanish. This can be justiﬁed only if the 
vacuum is a dielectric medium! If the vacuum is an empty space, there is no dielectric 
charge in it; then D should automatically equal to zero. 
In most standard electrodynamics textbooks used today, it is simply stated that 
bold upper D equals epsilon Subscript o Baseline bold upper Ein the vacuum, but offers no explanation why D should not vanish in the

vacuum. This negligence is probably because the physical nature of the vacuum is 
not well understood and people tried to avoid discussing it. 
With the hidden assumption that the vacuum is a dielectric medium, Maxwell 
hypothesized that there is a non-zero displacement current in the vacuum, and 
Ampere’s Law now becomes 
n a bla times bold upper H equals StartFraction partial differential bold upper D Over partial differential t EndFraction period
nabl

Then, one can relate the variations between E and H in the vacuum by using bold upper D equals epsilon Subscript o Baseline bold upper E, 
that is 
StartFraction partial differential bold upper E Over partial differential t EndFraction equals StartFraction 1 Over epsilon Subscript o Baseline EndFraction nabla times bold upper H period

By combining the above two equations, one can easily derive the wave equations for

From this review, it is clear that the Maxwell theory of light propagation required 
that the vacuum must behave like a dielectric medium. If the vacuum is an empty 
space, D must automatically equal to zero. It will then be impossible to derive the 
wave equation of light. 
6.2 Structure of the Vacuum Medium According 
to Maxwell’s Hypothesis 
Hence, according to Maxwell theory of electromagnetism and light propagation, 
the vacuum must behave like a dielectric medium. Conceptually, such a dielectric 
medium could be like what is shown in Fig. 6.2. Namely, the dielectric medium is 
most likely to be composed of two types of constituents with opposite charges.

6.2 Structure of the Vacuum Medium According to Maxwell’s Hypothesis
79
Fig. 6.2 Vacuum as 
dielectric medium. An 
important implication of the 
Maxwell theory of 
electromagnetic radiation is 
that the vacuum is a medium 
composed of dielectric 
charges 
Here, we should point out that, the dielectric medium making up the vacuum must 
be very different from ordinary dielectric materials, which is composed of electrons 
and ions. The vacuum cannot be composed of massive particles. First, the vacuum has 
no rest mass and thus cannot contain any material with non-zero rest mass. Second, 
the vacuum must be composed of very tiny materials. If particles are excitation 
waves of the vacuum medium, the components making up the vacuum must be far 
smaller than the wavelength of any quantum particles. Hence, one can only assume 
that the vacuum is ﬁlled with some sort of primordial dielectric charges, which 
are massless, highly reﬁned, isotropic, and uniformly distributed. (The detailed 
nature of the vacuum will be a very important topic for future studies of physics.) 
Here, we propose that the dielectric medium of the vacuum is composed of two 
types of components: (1) a negatively charged “n-type medium” (n-med) and (2) a 
positively charged “p-type medium” (p-med). Each of these medium is composed of 
very reﬁned primordial dielectric charges (see Fig. 6.3). 
Fig. 6.3 Vacuum is a dielectric medium composed of two types of components. In a simpliﬁed 
model, the vacuum can be thought of as the superposition of two oppositely charged mediums, the 
negatively charged “n-type medium” (n-med), and the positively charged “p-type medium” (p-med)

The Vacuum is a Dielectric Medium According to the Maxwell Theory …
Fig. 6.4 An electric ﬁeld will emerge at the location where the n-type medium and the p-type 
medium are separated. The vacuum medium is electrically neutral in the absence of any electric 
ﬁeld; its positive charges and negative charges are evenly distributed. When the vacuum is excited, 
the charges start to separate. The distribution of the n-type medium and the p-type medium is no 
longer entirely overlapping. Then, an electric ﬁeld will emerge at the location where the charges 
are separated 
In the absence of any electric ﬁeld, the vacuum is free of displacement charge, 
and the n-type medium and the p-type medium are evenly distributed; there is no net 
charge in the vacuum medium. But when the vacuum is under a disturbed state, such 
as the application of an external electric ﬁeld or the passing of an electromagnetic 
radiation wave, the charges start to separate. The distribution of the n-type medium 
and the p-type medium is no longer entirely overlapping. Then, an electric ﬁeld 
will emerge at the location where the n-type medium and the p-type medium are 
separated (see Fig. 6.4). The magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the 
“charge displacement” (i.e., bold upper D equals epsilon bold upper E). 
6.3 What is the Basic Field of the Vacuum Excitation Wave? 
Based on the above discussions, we can formally hypothesize that: Matter waves 
and radiation waves are both excitation waves of the vacuum; different types of 
free particles are represented by different excitation modes of this medium. If this 
is the case, the wave function of a free particle must represent a local movement of 
the vacuum medium; such a movement can be characterized by the variation of a 
“basic ﬁeld”. As we had discussed in the last chapter, this ﬁeld is not the same as 
the “classical ﬁeld” (such as the electric ﬁeld or the magnetic ﬁeld). The physical 
meaning of our basic ﬁeld is more closed to the “quantum ﬁeld” used in the quantum 
ﬁeld theory today (For details, please see Appendix B).

6.3 What is the Basic Field of the Vacuum Excitation Wave?

6.3.1 What is Its Basic Field of the Photon? 
The simplest quantum particle associated with the vacuum excitation wave is the 
photon. From classical electrodynamics, we know the photon is an electromagnetic 
wave. Indeed, from Eqs. (6.12) and (6.13), one can see that the wave equation of a 
photon directly describes the variation of E or H. Thus, one may think that the basic 
ﬁeld for a photon is either the electric or magnetic ﬁeld. However, this thinking is not 
correct, because there are certain additional requirements for the basic ﬁeld. In the  
quantum ﬁeld theory, the Lagrangian density of an excitation wave is known to be 
composed of the quadratic terms of the ﬁrst derivatives of the basic ﬁeld, so that one 
can apply the Euler-Lagrange equation on the Lagrangian density to obtain the wave 
equation [6]. For example, for a one-dimensional string, the Lagrangian density is 
known to be

Here, phiis the basic ﬁeld which represents the vertical displacement of the string, 
ρ is the mass density of the string, and uper F 1 is the tension of the stretched string (see 
Fig. 6.5). Since the Lagrangian density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the vacuum is

E or H does not appear to be suitable for playing the role of a basic ﬁeld. 
Then, what else can play the role of a basic ﬁeld for the photon? According to the 
Maxwell theory, E and H can be derived from the scalar potential Φ and the vector 
potential A. One may guess that these potential functions might play the role of the 
basic ﬁeld. It is well known that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are derivatives of Φ
and A [7], such that

the photon. Indeed, in the standard treatment of the quantum ﬁeld theory today, A is 
commonly regarded as the quantum ﬁeld of the photon. The Lagrangian density of 
the vacuum associated with a photon is written as [6]

(Here, we use the notation of contravariant and covariant four vectors, μ or ν equals 
0, 1, 2, 3 to represent the four-dimensional time–space; the  Einstein summation 
convention is also applied here.) 
A more careful examination of the wave excitation mechanism, however, 
suggests that the vector potential A is not the most appropriate basic ﬁeld [8]. In 
the following section, we will show that, it is the electric vector potential, instead of 
the magnetic vector potential, which can be justiﬁed to represent the displacement 
of the vacuum medium during wave excitation.

6.3 What is the Basic Field of the Vacuum Excitation Wave?
83
6.3.2 Origin of the Concept of Vector Potential: The Theorem 
of Helmholtz Decomposition 
In order to determine whether A is a proper measure of the vacuum displacement, let 
us ﬁrst review the original meaning of A. In the Maxwell theory, the vector potential 
A was deﬁned from the magnetic ﬂux B based on the relation 
bol d  u ppe
r B equals nabla times bold upper A period
According to the literature, Maxwell proposed Eq. (6.16) because he wanted to inter-
pret Faraday’s concept of “electro-tonic state” using the concept of vector potential 
introduced by Thomson [9]. However, from a mathematical point of view, one may 
recognize that Eq. (6.16) could be originated from the theorem of Helmholtz decom-
position. According to this theorem, any sufﬁciently smooth vector ﬁeld in a three-
dimensional space can be resolved into the sum of an irrotational (curl-free) vector 
ﬁeld and a solenoidal (divergence-free) vector ﬁeld. (For details, see Appendix C). 
For example, when one studies the motion of sound waves in an elastic solid, one 
can use the Helmholtz decomposition to separate the longitudinal wave movement 
from the transverse wave movement. That is, the displacement of a volume element 
(r) in the elastic solid can be decomposed as: 
bol d r e q ua ls 
minus nabla phi plus nabla times bold psi comma
where phi is called the “scalar potential”, and bold psiis called the “vector potential”. 
The curl-free component of a vector ﬁeld is often referred to as the “longitudinal 
component” and the divergence-free component is referred to as the “transverse 
component”. [10] 
One may recognize that Eq. (6.16) is just an analogy of Eq. (6.20). Since B is a 
vector ﬁeld, it can be decomposed based on the Helmholtz theorem. From experi-
mental observation, we know the magnetic ﬁeld is divergence-free [see Eq. (6.8)]. 
Thus, its curl-free term must be zero. One can then automatically obtain B = n abla times bold upper A. 
Here, A plays the role of bold psiin Eq. (6.20), while B is the counter part of r in the same 
equation. 
So, from a mathematical consideration, one could regard the vector potential A as 
a basic ﬁeld. However, if one considers the problem from a physical point of view, 
one may come to a different conclusion. In the following section, we will explain 
why the vector potential A is not the most appropriate basic ﬁeld representing the 
wave movement in the vacuum.

The Vacuum is a Dielectric Medium According to the Maxwell Theory …
6.4 The Excitation Wave of the Vacuum is Characterized 
by the Variation of the Electric Vector Potential Z 
From the analogy of sound wave transmission in an elastic solid, we know the exci-
tation wave is carried by the displacement of a volume element [which is represented 
by r in Eq. (6.20)]. In the case of wave transmission in the vacuum, what could play 
the role of the displacement of a volume element? Clearly, B could not play the role of 
being a displacement of the vacuum medium, since that would imply that the vacuum 
is composed of magnetic monopoles. Up to now, there is no experimental evidence 
to support the existence of magnetic monopoles in our universe. On the other hand, 
as we pointed out earlier, the vacuum behaves as a dielectric medium according to 
the Maxwell theory. Thus, the physical parameter representing the displacement of 
the vacuum medium should be the electric displacement D instead of the magnetic 
ﬂux B. 
In another word, if we want to model wave propagation in the vacuum in analogy 
to wave propagation in a physical medium, D should be the counter part of r. Thus, 
we may apply the Helmholtz decomposition theorem to decompose D into a curl-free 
component and a divergence-free component, i.e., 
bol d upp e r D e
quals minus nabla phi plus nabla times bold upper Z comma
where n a bla dot bold upper Z equals 0. We may call Z the “electric vector potential”. (From now on, A 
will be referred to as the “magnetic vector potential”.) In the vacuum, there is no 
free charge, rho  Subscript e Baseline equals 0. Thus, n a bla dot bold upper D equals minus nabla squared phi equals 0. This can be satisﬁed by choosing 
nabla phi equals 0. Equation (6.21) then becomes 
bol d  u ppe
r D equals nabla times bold upper Z period
From this relation, it is clear that the dynamic change of Z is a measure of the variation 
of the electric displacement D, which in turn represents the local movement of the 
vacuum medium. 
It can be shown that the electric vector potential Z can easily satisfy the mathe-
matical requirement of being a basic ﬁeld. From Eq.  (6.22) and the relation bold upper D equals epsilon Subscript o Baseline bold upper E, 
we see 
bold  upper E equals StartFraction 1 Over epsilon 0 EndFraction nabla times bold upper Z period
bol
d  upp
er E equals StartFraction 1 Over epsilon 0 EndFraction nabla times bold upper Z period
From the revised Ampère’s Law and Eq. (6.21), we can get

Thus, one can see that the electric ﬁeld E is a spatial derivative of the electric vector

above two equations into Eq. (6.15), we have

This Lagrangian density has a similar form as that of a one-dimensional string if one 
equates Z with the wave amplitude phi. Thus, we may identify the basic ﬁeld for the 
excitation wave of the vacuum as the electric vector potential (Z). 
6.4.1 Mechanism of Wave Propagation in the Vacuum 
as Driven by Z 
In the Maxwell theory, the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld H can cross-interact 
with each other. In fact, such cross-interactions are responsible for generating the 
electromagnetic radiation waves. From our analysis given in the preceding section, we 
found Z and A can also cross-interact with each other. In fact, such cross-interactions 
are fully capable to generate propagating waves in the vacuum.

where c equals StartRoot 1 divided by epsilon 0 mu 0 EndRoot √c equals StartRoot 1 divided by epsilon 0 mu 0 EndRoot is the speed of light. Thus, the variation of Z follows a wave 
equation that is similar to the wave equation of light. This supports our proposal that 
Z can represent the motion of the vacuum medium during wave excitation. 
6.5 Comparison Between Wave Excitations 
in the Mechanical System and the Vacuum Medium 
From the above discussions, one can see that there is a close analogy between the wave 
generating mechanisms in a mechanical medium and those in the vacuum. Table 6.1 
is a detailed comparison between different types of wave generating mechanisms. 
When a mechanical medium (such as an elastic solid) is undergoing an excitation, 
its strain is represented by a displacement vector r, and its stress (local force/ﬁeld) 
is a tensor related to the strain via the generalized Hooke’s Law. Similarly, when the 
vacuum medium is undergoing an excitation, it produces an electric displacement 
D; the local electric ﬁeld E is related to D through a relation analogous to Hooke’s 
Law, bold  upper E equals StartFraction 1 Over epsilon 0 EndFraction bold upper D
bol
d upper E equals StartFraction 1 Over epsilon 0 EndFraction bold upper D. Furthermore, the displacement vector r can be decomposed into a 
curl-free component φ and a divergence-free component ψ. Similarly, the electric 
displacement vector D can also be decomposed into a curl-free component nabla phiand 
a divergence-free component n a bla times bold upper Z. The only difference is that here nab la phi equals 0 in 
the vacuum. This means that, unlike the elastic solid, the vacuum medium has no 
longitudinal wave; it can only generate transverse waves.
From Table 6.1, one can see that, regardless of the nature of the wave medium, 
wave propagation requires a cross-interacting mechanism. For wave propagation in 
an elastic solid, the cross-interaction is mediated through two coupling equations, 
i.e., the Newton’s Law and the generalized Hooke’s Law. For the vacuum medium, 
the coupling equations appear to be the Ampere’s Law (as modiﬁed by Maxwell) and 
Faraday’s Law. But at a deeper level, we ﬁnd the coupling equations are more like 
the cross-interactions between the electric vector potential Z and the magnetic vector 
potential A, i.e., StartFraction partial differential bold upper Z Over partial differential t EndFraction equals StartFraction 1 Over mu 0 EndFraction nabla times bold upper A

that generated the excitation wave. 
Another interesting point one can see from Table 6.1 is that, no matter for mechan-
ical medium or vacuum medium, all wave equations appear to have the same form. 
They are highly symmetrical. For later reference, we may call these wave equations

equations in different systems look the same, their wave functions represent very 
different basic ﬁelds. Such ﬁelds are associated with different measurements of the 
medium displacement. 
6.6 Chapter Summary 
• We discovered that the Maxwell theory had a hidden assumption; namely, 
the vacuum should behave like a dielectric medium. A major contribution of 
Maxwell was his introduction of theelectricdisplacement D into electrodynamics. 
Maxwell’s theory of light propagation required that the vacuum must behave

like a dielectric medium. If the vacuum is an empty space, D must automatically 
equal to zero. It will then be impossible to derive the wave equation of light. 
• Then, one can only assume that the vacuum is ﬁlled with some sort of primordial 
dielectric charges, which are massless, highly reﬁned, isotropic, and uniformly 
distributed. Here, we propose that the dielectric medium of the vacuum is 
composed of two types of components: (1) a negatively charged “n-type medium” 
and (2) a positively charged “p-type medium”. Each of these media is composed 
of very reﬁned primordial dielectric charges. 
• The wave function of a free particle represents a local movement of the vacuum 
medium; such a movement can be characterized by the variation of a “basic 
ﬁeld”. Since the vacuum behaves as a dielectric medium, the physical param-
eter representing the displacement of the vacuum medium should be the electric 
displacement D instead of the magnetic ﬂux B. 
• By applying the Helmholtz decomposition theorem to decompose D, one can 
show that bol d  upper D equals nabla times bold upper Z, where Z is a newly deﬁned parameter called the “electric 
vector potential”. The dynamic change of Z is a measure of the variation of the 
electric displacement D. One can identify Z as the “basic ﬁeld” of the vacuum, 
since it represents the local movement of the vacuum medium. 
• Based on our analysis, one can see that there is a close analogy between the wave 
generating mechanisms in a mechanical medium (such as an elastic solid) and 
those in the vacuum. But unlike the elastic solid, the vacuum medium has no 
longitudinal wave; it can only generate transverse waves.

Derivation of the Quantum Wave 
Equations and the Physical Meaning 
of the Quantum Wave Function

Chapter 7 
Derivation of the Quantum Wave 
Equations Based on Wave Excitation 
in the Vacuum 
In the last chapter, we showed that based on the Maxwell theory, the quantum vacuum 
is found to behave like a dielectric medium. The excitation wave of the vacuum 
is carried by a newly deﬁned electric vector potential, Z, the variation of which 
characterizes the local movement oftheelectricdisplacement D. Using the Helmholtz 
decomposition theorem, one can show that the electric ﬁeld E is associated with the 
curl of Z, while the magnetic ﬁeld H is associated with the time derivative of Z. 
Therefore, Z is a direct measure of the dynamic changes of the local electric and 
magnetic ﬁelds of the vacuum. 
In wave mechanics, the excitation wave is often described by an oscillation of a 
basic ﬁeld, which represents the movement of the wave medium. Since we believe 
the matter wave is an excitation wave of the vacuum, we expect that the basic ﬁeld 
for the matter wave should be the electric vector potential (Z). In the following, we 
will show that this is indeed the case. 
Furthermore, it can be shown that the known quantum wave equations (for parti-
cles with or without mass) can be derived directly from the wave equation of the 
vacuum. In this chapter, we will show that both the wave equation of a photon and 
the Klein–Gordon equation can be derived directly from the wave equation of Z.1 
Most interestingly, such derivation also suggests a way to connect the concept of 
“rest mass” to a wave property.

7.1 The Wave Equation of the Quantum Vacuum 
7.1.1 
Identifying Z as the Wave Function of the Excitation 
Wave in the Vacuum 
Our proposal to identify the electric vector potential Z as the basic ﬁeld of the 
vacuum excitation waves is mainly based on the following considerations: 
First, Z is a direct measure of the displacement of the vacuum medium. From  
the Maxwell theory, we showed that the quantum vacuum behaves like a dielectric 
medium. During wave propagation, the motion of this vacuum medium is represented 
by the dynamic change of the electric displacement D, which is characterized by the 
vector potential Z based on the Helmholtz theorem. Thus, Z is a direct measure of 
the motion of the vacuum medium. 
Furthermore, Z satisﬁes the mathematical requirement of being a basic ﬁeld. 
If one uses the Lagrangian formulism to derive a wave equation for the vacuum, 
the wave function should represent a basic ﬁeld, which must satisfy certain criteria. 
One of these criteria is that the Lagrangian density for the system is composed of 
quadratic terms of the ﬁrst derivatives of the basic ﬁeld. Z can clearly satisfy this 
requirement. In fact, this can be demonstrated clearly using the 4-vector notation [1]. 
We can write upper Z Superscript mu Baseline equals left parenthesis 0 comma bold upper Z right parenthesisand deﬁne a tensor

As shown in Appendix B, one can use this Lagrangian density and the Hamilton’s

This equation is identical to the wave equation of the vacuum as derived from the

In the following sections, we will show that the dynamic change of Z not only 
can give the correct wave equation for a photon, but it can also give the quantum 
wave equation of a massive particle.

7.1.2 
Connecting Z with the Quantum Wave Function 
of a Particle 
In this model, we propose that both the radiation wave and matter wave are excitation 
waves of the same quantum vacuum. Then, not only Z can represent the wave function 
of light, it can also represent the wave function of the matter wave. To connect the 
vector potential Z with the quantum wave function (ψ) of a particle, we can consider 
a simple case in which Z is polarized in a ﬁxed direction, that is, 
bold uppe r Z  left pa

where Ek is a polarization factor which speciﬁes the orientation of Z. Let us denote 
the position vector as x = (x1,x2,x3) and choose the axis x3 as parallel to the motion 
of the particle, i.e., bold italic x 3 double vertical bar bold italic k (see Fig. 7.1a). Since Z is a transverse wave, Ek can be 
written as

where a1, a2 and θ 1, θ 2 are amplitudes and phase angles; they are ﬁtting constants 
(see Fig. 7.1b). By substituting Eq. (7.5) into Eq. (7.4), we have

nabla squared psi minus StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction StartFraction partial differential squared psi Over partial differential t squared EndFraction equals 0 period nabla squared psi minus StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction StartFraction partial differential squared psi Over partial differential t squared EndFraction equals 0 period 
From now on, we will call this the “Wave Equation of the Vacuum (WEV)”.

7.3 Deriving the Wave Equation of a Massive Particle 
One may note that the plane wave solution is only the simplest solution of WEV. The 
general solutions of the WEV are more complicated. Could some of these complex 
solutions of the WEV represent the matter wave of certain massive particles? The 
quantum mechanical wave equations for some massive particles are already known. 
For example, the quantum wave equation for a scalar particle is the Klein–Gordon 
equation, while the quantum wave equation for the electron is the Dirac equation. 
Can one derive these quantum wave equations based on the wave equation of Z? In  
the following, we will show that this is indeed possible.

7.3.1 
Physical Nature of the Wave Function Representing 
a Massive Particle 
Since a massive particle behaves like a point object in the macroscopic scale, we 
expect that it should be found mainly along its trajectory. That means its wave function 
is concentrated near the center of its pathway. In another word, the wave function 
should vary not only along the coordinate parallel to its trajectory (i.e., Mod ifyingAbove bold italic k With caret dot bold italic x), but 
also in the transverse plane (Mod ifyingAbove bold italic k With caret times bold italic x). Therefore, the wave function representing a free 
particle can be written in the following form,

where psi Subscript upper T is the transverse component of the wave function, while psi Subscript p a t h is the 
longitudinal component of the wave function that describes the motion of the traveling 
wave along the particle’s trajectory. Substituting Eq. (7.10) into Eq. (7.7), and recall

(where ak is a normalizing constant). As expected, the wave function of a free particle 
behaves like a traveling wave along the direction of its trajectory. Because of the phase

decreases in an oscillating manner in the transverse direction. It behaves almost like 
a vortex (see Fig.  7.2) .
A very important outcome in our solution of the wave equation of the vacuum 
(WEV) is the restriction on the parameter n in Eq. (7.15). Mathematically, in the 
“Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind” (upper J Subscript n), the parameter n can be either an integer 
or a half-integer. When n is an integer, the phase factor e Superscript plus or minus i n theta is a normal rotating 
function. It is straightforward that θ and θ + 2π give the same point. But if n is a 
half-integer, such as n = ½, the rotation of the particle is more complicated, since 
θ and θ + 2π do not give the same point. The phase factor must rotate two cycles 
in order to return to its original point. For example, the full cycle of the transverse 
wave function for a particle with n = ½ is plotted in Fig. 7.3.
Since the wave function (having an integer n) and the wave function (having a 
half-integer n) have very different topological features, it is reasonable to suspect

that these two types of wave functions may represent particles of different kinds. 
Indeed, from Eq. (7.16), it is clear that the parameter n speciﬁes mainly the rotation 
of the wave function along the particle trajectory; one may identify n as the “spin” 
of the particle. If this interpretation is correct, then particles represented by the 
wave function having an integer n would be “bosons”, and particles represented by 
the wave function having a half-integer n would be “fermions”. The mathematical

condition of our solution thus predicts that all particles in nature must be either 
bosons or fermions; there is no possibility of having a third kind of particles (such 
as having a spin of 1/3 or other fractional numbers). 
7.4 Identifying the Physical Meaning of Parameters Within 
the Wave Function 
The wave function shown in Eq. (7.16) contains four parameters, ω, k, script l, and n. From  
the discussion above, we know n could be related to the spin of the particle. What are 
the physical meanings of the other parameters? We can get some idea by comparing 
this wave function with that of a photon. In the case of a photon wave function 
(Eq. (7.8)), it is well known that ω and k are related to the energy (E) and momentum 
(p) of the particle, as described by the Planck’s relation and the de Broglie relation. If 
we compare the traveling wave component of Eq. (7.16) with Eq. (7.8), it is easy to 
see that ω and k should have the same meanings, i.e., upp e r E equals italic h over two pi omegaand bo l d  italic p equals italic h over two pi bold italic k. (In fact, 
according to the quantum wave model, both the Planck’s relation and de Broglie’s 
relation hold for a wave function representing a free particle with mass) [2]. 
Now, what is the physical meaning of script l? Our recent work suggested that script l is 
related to the rest mass of the particle [3]. This can be easily shown. From the 
Planck’s relation and de Broglie’s relation, Eq. (7.14) becomes 
upper E squared equals c squared left parenthesis p squared plus italic h over two pi squared script l squared right parenthesis period 
upper E equals StartRoot c squared p squared plus c squared italic h over two pi squared script l squared EndRoot period
√
upper E equals StartRoot c squared p squared plus c squared italic h over two pi squared script l squared EndRoot period

m 0 equals StartFraction italic h over two pi script l Over c EndFraction period 
m 0
 equals StartFraction italic h over two pi script l Over c EndFraction period 
Substituting this into Eq. (7.17), one can see that the dispersion relation now leads 
to 
upper E squared equals p squared c squared plus m 0 squared c Superscript 4 Baseline period 

7.4 Identifying the Physical Meaning of Parameters Within the Wave Function

Thus, by identifying the wave parameter script l with the rest mass mo, one can naturally 
obtain the energy–momentum relation of a free particle. By combining Eq. (7.18) 
and (7.19), one can also see that the mass of a particle is speed dependent 
m e
quals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period 
√
m equals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period 
By combining Eqs. (7.20) and (7.21), and p equals m v, one can further obtain 
upper E equals m c squared period 
This result suggests that the famous mass-energy conversion relation is really a 
consequence of the fact that the quantum particle is an excitation wave of the vacuum 
medium. 
Our ﬁnding that the wave parameter script l is associated with the rest mass is not 
totally surprising. Since both momentum and energy of a free particle are known to 
be connected with “wave vector/wave number” (inverse of wavelength) in the spatial 
and temporal dimensions, it is reasonable to speculate that the rest mass may be 
connected with some sort of “intrinsic wave number” too. This is indeed the case. 
The asymptotic form of the Bessel function is known to be

Thus, script l can be regarded as the “transverse wave number” of the free particle. In fact, 
from Eqs. (7.23) and (7.19), one can easily see that the wavelength of this transverse 
oscillation is 
lam da Subscript upper T Baseline equals StartFraction 2 pi Over script l EndFraction equals StartFraction h Over m 0 c EndFraction comma
l am da Subscript upper T Baseline equals StartFraction 2 pi Over script l EndFraction equals StartFraction h Over m 0 c EndFraction comma
lamda
 Subscript upper T Baseline equals StartFraction 2 pi Over script l EndFraction equals StartFraction h Over m 0 c EndFraction comma
which is identical to the so-called “Compton wavelength” (lamda Subscript c) of the particle [5]. 
Our ﬁnding that the rest mass is associated with the oscillation periodicity in 
the transverse direction appears to make very good sense. It is closely parallel to 
the Planck’s relation and the de Broglie relation, which show that the energy and 
momentum are related to the periodicity of oscillation of the vacuum medium. More 
speciﬁcally, E is shown to be related to the periodicity of oscillation in the time 
dimension, while p is related to the periodicity of oscillation in the spatial dimension 
along the direction of the particle trajectory. In essence, these results suggest that 
energy, momentum, and mass have very similar physical meanings; all of them are 
related to the oscillation periodicity in different dimensions of space–time.

equation [4, 6, 7]. Using the results obtained in the last section, one can easily derive 
the Klein–Gordon equation directly from the wave equation of the vacuum. As shown

7.6 Chapter Summary 
• We proposed that both the radiation wave and matter wave are excitation waves 
of the same quantum vacuum, the wave function of which is represented by the 
vector potential Z. The dynamic change of Z is described by the wave equation 
of the vacuum, which can be derived using the Maxwell theory.

• The quantum wave equation of a photon can be derived based on the dynamic 
change of Z. The simplest solution of this wave equation is a plane wave. 
• For a massive particle, its wave function not only varies along the coordinate 
parallel to its trajectory, but also in the transverse plane. Thus, the wave function 
can be written as the product of a transverse wave function left parenthesis psi Subscript upper T Baseline right parenthesisand a longitudinal 
wave function
l
eft p
arenthesis psi Subscript p a t h Baseline right parenthesis
, and the latter describes the motion of the traveling wave 
along the particle’s trajectory. 
• One can then solve the wave equation of the vacuum by using the technique 
of separation of variables. The wave function of the free particle behaves like 
a traveling wave along the direction of its trajectory; its transverse component, 
however, oscillates following the Bessel function upper J Subscript n Baseline left parenthesis script l r right parenthesis. Thus, the wave function 
representing a massive particle propagates in a helical fashion and behaves like a 
vortex. 
• The parameter n in the Bessel function can either be an integer or half-integer. One  
can identify n as the spin of the particle. Then, particles represented by the wave 
function having an integer n would be “bosons”, while particles represented by the 
wave function having a half-integer n would be “fermions”. The mathematical 
condition of our solution thus predicts that all particles in nature must be 
either bosons or fermions. 
• The wave function contains four parameters, ω, k, script l, and n. Besides n being identi-
ﬁed with the spin, ω and k are identiﬁed with the particle’s energy and momentum, 
based on the Planck’s relation and the de Broglie relation. The wave parameter
script l is identiﬁed with the rest mass. From these results, the so-called “relativistic 
energy–momentum relation” can be directly obtained from the dispersion relation 
of the particle wave function. 
• The Klein–Gordon equation can be derived directly from the wave equation of 
the vacuum. This derivation required that the wave function of the Klein–Gordon 
equation describes only the longitudinal component of the matter wave, i.e., the 
motion of the particle along its trajectory

Derivation of the Dirac Equation 
from the Wave Equation of the Vacuum 
In the last chapter, we showed that the wave equation of a photon can be easily derived 
from the wave equation of the vacuum. This is no surprise. The more interesting 
ﬁnding is that, the quantum wave equation for a massive particle can also be derived 
from the wave equation of the vacuum medium. This equation is called the “Klein– 
Gordon equation”, which is known to describe the movement of a quantum particle 
with spin = 0 (i.e., a boson). Since matter is made of atoms and the physicochemical 
property of an atom is determined by the state of the electrons, the more important 
quantum wave equation would be the quantum wave equation for an electron (e.g., the 
Schrödinger equation or the Dirac equation). Could such quantum wave equation for 
spin = ½ particle be derived from the wave equation of the vacuum? In the following, 
we will show that this is indeed the case. That is, not only the Klein–Gordon equation, 
but the Dirac equation can also be derived directly from the wave equation of the 
vacuum. 
8.1 
Derivation of the Quantum Wave Equation 
for an Electron 
The Schrödinger equation was the ﬁrst quantum wave equation to describe the wave 
function of an electron. But it was designed for a non-relativistic case. Thus, another 
theoretical physicist, Paul Dirac (see Fig. 8.1), decided to develop a new quantum 
wave equation to cover the relativistic situation. His approach was trying to linearize 
the quantum wave equation and to develop a quantum commutation relation in 
analogy to classical mechanics [1–3]. The following is a concise review of Dirac’s 
original approach in deriving his famous equation. Then, we will show how to derive 
the Dirac equation based on the quantum wave model. One will see that our derivation 
based on the wave model is more straightforward.

8.1.1 
How did Dirac Derive his Equation Originally? 
In the early twentieth century, physicists were mainly trained in classical physics, 
and thus, their view of the sub-atomic particles was heavily inﬂuenced by the clas-
sical mechanical concepts. This was no exception for Dirac. So, when he started to 
develop his quantum theory of the electron, he naturally regarded the electron as a 
point mass. He based his development of the quantum theory on an analogy with 
classical mechanics [1]. Dirac’s derivation of his quantum wave equation involved 
the following steps. 
First, Dirac tried to identify the energy operator p 0 and the momentum operators 
p 1, p 2, p 3 based on an argument that the commutation relations between p’s and 
q’s are similar between the quantum conditions and the classical conditions. (Here, 
q is the canonical coordinate and p is the momentum.) That is, he assumed that in 
quantum mechanics, the p’s and q’s should obey the commutation relations:

Dirac called these commutation relations the fundamental quantum conditions. 
Then, Dirac argued that, since the linear operators minus i italic h over two pi partial differential slash partial differential q Subscript r and q’s satisfy the 
same commutation relations as the fundamental quantum conditions between the p’s 
and q’s, he identiﬁed p 0  equals i italic h over two pi partial differential slash partial differential x 0 and p S u bscript r Baseline equals minus i italic h over two pi partial differential slash partial differential x Subscript r, where r = 1, 2, 3. 
One may notice that these identiﬁcations are similar to what Schrödinger used 
earlier in his development of the quantum wave equation. 
Next, he deduced from quite general arguments that the relativistic quantum wave 
equation must be linear in the operator partial differential slash partial differential t and partial differential slash partial differential x Subscript r, that is, the correct wave

where p 0 is the energy operator and p 1, p 2, p 3 are momentum operators, the α’s and 
β are coefﬁcients independent of the p’s, the value of which will be determined later. 
Here, he used the four-vector notation (x0, x1, x2, x3), which corresponds to (t, x, y, 
z). 
Finally, to identify the α’s and β, Dirac argued that the linear wave equation 
proposed by him (i.e., Eq. (8.1) should be consistent with the relativistic energy– 
momentum relation, that is, the wave equation for the electron should obey

Thus, by multiplying the Eq. (8.1) by the operator left  brac e p  0 pl us alpha  1 p 1 plus alpha 2 p 2 plus alpha 3 p 3 plus beta right brace
on the left, he obtained

By comparing this equation with (8.2), he could identify the values of the α’s 
and β. As it turns out, the α’s and β are shown to be associated with a vector σ 
represented by 4 × 4 matrix. Dirac interpreted σ as the origin of spin of the particle. 
The Eq. (8.1) is subsequently called the “Dirac equation”. 
The Dirac equation is a highly successful equation that provides a theoretical 
basis for calculating the quantum effects of electrons. However, one may see that, 
Dirac’s original derivation was very complicated and involved a number of theoretical 
assumptions and conjectures, some of which could be debatable. Such complication 
is probably because it is very difﬁcult to develop a quantum wave equation based on 
the classical mechanical view. In the following, we will show that the Dirac equation 
can be derived more naturally based on the quantum wave model. In fact, one can see 
that the Dirac equation is a direct consequence of the wave equation of the vacuum 
(WEV). 
8.2 
Derivation of the Dirac Equation Based 
on the Quantum Wave Model 
In the quantum wave model, we hypothesize that all particles are excitation waves 
of the vacuum medium, thus, they should obey the same vacuum wave equation 
regardless of mass and spin. In the last chapter, we showed that the wave equation of 
the vacuum (WEV) is Eq. (7.7). Different particles are expected to be represented by 
its different solutions. In fact, we showed that both the wave equation of a photon and 
the wave equation of a massive particle (the Klein–Gordon equation) can be derived

Derivation of the Dirac Equation from the Wave Equation of the Vacuum
directly from the wave equation of the vacuum. Now, since the WEV is a general 
wave equation for all particles, it is not only valid for scalar particles, but it should 
also be valid for spin = ½ particles. 
This means that one should be able to derive the wave equations for an electron 
from WEV. In the following, we will show that the WEV can indeed lead to the Dirac 
equation. 
8.2.1 
To Derive the Dirac Equation by Factorizing 
the Klein–Gordon Equation 
In order to derive the Dirac equation from the WEV, we make use of three 
considerations: 
(a) We hypothesize that, like the Klein–Gordon equation, the Dirac equation may 
represent only the longitudinal component of the matter wave. That is, the wave 
function of the Dirac equation is connected to the psi Subscript p a t h component of psi Subscript ModifyingAbove bold italic k With bold caret. 
(b) If this is the case, one may be able to show that the Dirac equation is a special 
case of the Klein–Gordon equation. Since we already knew the Klein–Gordon 
equation is a special case of the WEV, then, the solution of the Dirac equation 
should automatically satisfy the WEV. 
(c) The wave function representing a matter wave is not necessarily a scalar func-
tion. Depending on the spin of the particle, the wave functions may have 
different mathematical forms. Some can be scalars, while others can be vectors 
or matrices. For particles with spin equals 0, the solution can simply be a scalar 
function. In the case of an electron, the situation could be more complicated. 
Since it has a spin = ½, its full wave function (as shown in Eq. (7.16) cannot 
be a single-valued function in respect to θ. Thus, it may be more appropriate to 
use a matrix to represent it. 
If we denote ψ as a special solution of the Klein–Gordon equation that represents 
a free electron, ψ should satisfy

One can see that, in order to make Eq. (8.5a) equal to Eq. (8.4a), the parameter α 
and β must satisfy the following conditions:

These conditions post a restriction on the possible mathematical form of the param-
eters α and β. If α and β are ordinary numbers, it is impossible for them to satisfy 
Eq. (8.8). In order to satisfy those conditions, both α and β must be treated as a 4 × 
4 matrix. It can be shown that the conditions Eq. (8.8) can indeed be satisﬁed if one 
deﬁnes the matrices α and β as [4]

Derivation of the Dirac Equation from the Wave Equation of the Vacuum
From the above analysis, it is clear that, if one wants to make the Dirac equation 
to satisfy the Klein–Gordon equation, α and β must be treated as 4 × 4 matrices [5]. 
In other words, the Dirac equation must be treated as 4 × 4 matrix equation. In the 
literature, the Dirac equation can also be expressed using a set of 4 × 4 gamma Subscript mumatrices 
[4], which are given by

These 4 × 4 matrices gamma Subscript muare called the gamma matrices or the Dirac matrices. Using  
these gamma matrices, the linearized equation (Eq. (8.6)) now can be rewritten as

where μ = 1, 2, 3, 4. This is another common form of the “Dirac equation” [4]. 
A major advantage of the Dirac equation is that it naturally brought in the spin 
concept through the incorporation of Pauli’s spin matrices. It can be shown that, by 
making use of Pauli’s two-component theory, the spin of the particle can be included 
in the energy of the electron [4]. 
8.3 
Physical Meaning of the Dirac Wave Function 
It is now clear that the Dirac equation is a special case of the Klein–Gordon equation, 
which in turn is a special case of the WEV. Thus, any solution of the Dirac equation 
should also satisfy the WEV. This means that all electron wave functions obtained 
from the Dirac equation should automatically satisfy the wave equation of the vacuum 
[5]. 
Since the Dirac equation is a matrix equation, the wave function ψ must become 
a four-component column matrix (which is called a “spinor”).

In current literature, the four-component column matrix ψ is called the “Dirac 
spinor” [4], psi Subscript Sub Subscript upper L is called the left-hand spinor and psi Subscript Sub Subscript upper R is called the right-hand spinor. 
The Dirac equation has been shown to be highly successful in describing the motion 
of an electron. In fact, the modern quantum ﬁeld theory of electrons is almost entirely 
based on the Dirac equation. From the above review, one can see clearly that the Dirac 
equation is a derivative of the Klein–Gordon equation. But since the Klein–Gordon 
equation itself is a derivative of the WEV, it is obvious that the Dirac equation is also 
a derivative of the WEV. Thus, the wave function representing an electron is just a 
special solution of the WEV of the matter wave. 
Why is the wave function representing an electron a spinor instead of a scalar? 
It is probably because it is a particle with n = 1/2. This makes the wave function 
not returning to the original values when θ is rotated by 2π. That means the wave 
function cannot be a single-valued function. It should have at least two values: (a) ψ 
(θ = 0 to 2π); (b) ψ (θ = 2π to 4π). This implies that ψ can be a column matrix 
with at least two components. But since the phase for the wave equation can take 
on plus or minus i n theta, the wave function can rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The 
wave function could be a mixture of a left-hand matrix and a right-hand matrix. This 
may explain why the wave function representing a free electron should have four 
components as shown in Eq. (8.10). 
From the above analysis, one can see that, the wave functions of different types 
of particles are represented by different solutions of the vacuum wave equation (see 
Table 8.1). For example, the photon can be represented by a plane wave; the scalar 
particle can be represented by a cylindrically symmetrical vortex wave, while the 
electron can be represented by a 4-column matrix (spinor).

Derivation of the Dirac Equation from the Wave Equation of the Vacuum
8.4 
Dirac’s “Hole Theory” and the Prediction 
of Anti-Particle 
Today, the Dirac equation has become the foundation of the quantum ﬁeld theory of 
electrons; it is used to describe all spin-1/2 massive particles, called “Dirac particles”, 
such as electrons and all leptons. The Dirac equation is also credited with predicting 
the existence of “anti-particles”. Such a “great discovery”, however, involved some 
bold interpretations. 
When Dirac ﬁrst derived his equation, he encountered a big problem. His equation 
not only gives positive-energy solutions, it can also generate negative-energy solu-
tions [6]. How to interpret the negative-energy solutions of his equation becomes a 
problem. Mathematically speaking, there seems to be no reason for him to reject the 
negative-energy solutions. Then, any electron occupying a positive-energy eigen-
state would decay into a negative-energy state of successively lower energy. That 
means the electron can keep on emitting photons and we cannot have stable atoms 
to construct our world. 
To cope with this problem, Dirac introduced a very bold hypothesis, known as the 
“hole theory” [6, 7]. He argued that all the negative-energy electron eigenstates are 
occupied. Because of the Pauli exclusion principle, any additional electron would 
be forced to occupy a positive-energy eigenstate. In essence, he assumed that the 
vacuum is ﬁlled with an inﬁnite number of negative-energy electrons. This “sea” of 
negative-energy electrons is called the “Dirac sea” [8]. 
Dirac further reasoned that, if one of these negative-energy electrons is knocked 
off by a gamma ray, the knock-off electron would gain energy to become a positive-
energy electron; the unﬁlled vacancy—called a hole—would behave like a positively 
charged particle, with the same mass as the electron [9]. This hole therefore behaves 
like an anti-particle of the electron (called “positron”). (See Fig. 8.2). The particle 
positron was experimentally discovered by Carl Anderson in 1932 [10]. 
Fig. 8.2 The Dirac sea of 
negative-energy electrons. 
In Dirac’s theory, the 
vacuum is pre-ﬁlled by a sea 
of negative-energy electrons. 
An energetic gamma ray can 
kick out one of the 
negative-energy electrons to 
become a positive-energy 
electron. The hole left 
behind can be regarded as 
the anti-particle of the 
electron, i.e., the positron

8.5 Chapter Summary
111
Although Dirac was given big credit for predicting the existence of the anti-
particle, the assumption of an inﬁnite “Dirac sea” of negative-energy electrons is 
troublesome. There is just no experimental evidence that our vacuum is ﬁlled with 
an inﬁnite number of negative-energy electrons. This assumption appears to be ad 
hoc and arbitrary. 
In fact, when Dirac ﬁrst proposed his hole theory, most physicists did not take 
it seriously. For example, W. Pauli had expressed criticism on Dirac’s hole theory: 
“Recently Dirac attempted the explanation, already discussed by Oppenheimer, of 
identifying the holes with antielectrons, particles of charge plus StartAbsoluteValue e EndAbsoluteValueand the electron 
mass. Likewise, in addition to protons, there must be antiprotons. The experimental 
absence of such particles is then traced back to a special initial state in which only 
one of the two kinds of particles is present. We see that this already appears to be 
unsatisfactory because the laws of nature in this theory with respect to electrons and 
antielectrons are exactly symmetrical. Thus γ -ray photons (at least two in order to 
satisfy the laws of conservation of energy and momentum) must be able to transform, 
by themselves, into an electron and an antielectron. We do not believe, therefore, that 
this explanation can be seriously considered” [11]. Since electrons and positrons are 
symmetrical in the view of nature, based on Dirac’s argument, one could also assume 
that the vacuum is ﬁlled with a “Dirac sea” of inﬁnite number of negative-energy 
positrons, and electron is the hole left behind when a negative-energy positron is 
excited. Thus, Dirac’s hole theory would have its own trouble. 
Such trouble can be totally avoided in our quantum wave model. In our deriva-
tion of the Dirac equation based on the wave view, there was no assumption of any 
pre-existing negative-energy electron sea in the vacuum. The Dirac equation only 
provides the quantum wave equation governing the movement of the excitation wave 
with ½ spin. The negative-energy solution means that the frequency has a negative 
sign, i.e., ome ga equals minus StartAbsoluteValue omega EndAbsoluteValue. That could just indicate that the wave packet is moving back-
ward. This model does not require the assumption of a “Dirac sea” of negative-energy 
particles.

Chapter Summary 
• Dirac’s original derivation was very complicated and involved a number of conjec-
tures. He regarded the electron as a point mass and developed his quantum theory 
on an analogy with classical mechanics. First, he identiﬁed the energy operator 
and the momentum operator, based on a hypothetical “fundamental quantum 
condition”. Next, he deduced from quite general arguments that the relativistic 
quantum wave equation must be linear in the operator partial differential slash partial differential t and partial differential slash partial differential x Subscript r. Finally, he 
arrived at a linearized wave equation by assuming that the quantum wave function 
of an electron is a spinor. 
• We show that the Dirac equation can be derived more naturally (and more easily) 
based on the quantum wave model. In fact, one can see that the Dirac equation is 
a direct consequence of the wave equation of the vacuum.

Derivation of the Dirac Equation from the Wave Equation of the Vacuum
• Since the electron is a massive particle, according to our model, the Dirac equa-
tion should be a special case of the Klein–Gordon equation. Its wave function 
represents only the longitudinal component of the matter wave. In the case of an 
electron, its wave function can be represented by a 4-component column matrix. 
Then, it is easy to see that the Dirac equation is a linearized wave equation which 
can be obtained directly by factorizing the Klein–Gordon equation. 
• A major advantage of the Dirac equation is that it naturally brought in the spin 
concept through the incorporation of Pauli’s spin matrices. 
• In current literature, the 4-component column matrix ψ is called the “Dirac 
spinor”, which is made up of two sub-components: psi Subscript Sub Subscript upper L is called the left-hand 
spinor and psi Subscript Sub Subscript upper R is called the right-hand spinor. In our model, the wave functions 
of different types of particles are represented by different solutions of the vacuum 
wave equation (see Table 8.1). For example, the photon can be represented by a 
plane wave; the scalar particle can be represented by a cylindrically symmetrical 
vortex wave, while the electron can be represented by a 4-column matrix (spinor). 
• The Dirac equation is credited with predicting the existence of “anti-particle”. 
Such a “great discovery”, however, involved some bold interpretations. Dirac 
assumed that the vacuum is ﬁlled with an inﬁnite number of negative-energy 
electrons (called the “Dirac sea”). If one of these negative-energy electrons is 
knocked off by a gamma ray, the knock-off electron would gain energy to become 
a positive-energy electron; the unﬁlled vacancy—called a hole—would behave 
like a positively charged anti-particle of electron (called “positron”).

Derivation of the Schrödinger Equation: 
What is the Physical Meaning of Its Wave 
Function? 
From the previous chapter, one can see that the quantum wave equation of the electron 
(the Dirac equation) is really a derivative of the wave equation of the vacuum, which 
describes the motion of the electric vector potential Z. Once the Dirac equation is 
derived, one can further derive the Schrödinger equation from the mechanism of 
vacuum excitation. It has been shown that, under the condition where the Coulombic 
energy and the kinetic energy of the electron are much smaller than the electron’s 
resting energy (mc2), the Dirac equation can be reduced into the Schrödinger equation 
[1]. Thus, the work shown in the above not only demonstrated that the Klein–Gordon 
equation and the Dirac equation can be derived from the wave equation of Z, it  
suggested that the Schrödinger equation can also be derived from the wave equation 
of Z as well. 
From a historical perspective, however, the Schrödinger equation was derived 
before the Dirac equation. Thus, we will not try to derive the Schrödinger equation 
from the Dirac equation. Instead, we will trace the derivation of the Schrödinger 
equation based on the Klein–Gordon equation. Furthermore, since the wave function 
in the Dirac equation is a spinor, while the wave functions in the Schrödinger equation 
and Klein–Gordon equation are both scalar, it is more natural to connect the last two 
equations together. In this way, it is easier to see the physical meaning of the wave 
function.

of a system and describe how it changes dynamically in time. The Schrödinger equa-
tion is used very widely nowadays. In fact, it is the major tool for most calculations 
conducted in atomic physics, molecular physics, quantum optics, condensed matter 
physics, etc. Most of the modern technologies used today can be attributed to the 
development of the Schrödinger equation. 
Historically, the Schrödinger equation was derived by Erwin Schrödinger (See 
Fig. 9.1) based on his conjecture in a classical mechanical view, instead of from 
ﬁrst principle [2–6]. According to Richard Feynman, the key step in Schrödinger’s 
derivation of his equation was purely conjecture. “Where did we get that from? 
Nowhere. It’s not possible to derive it from anything you know. It came out of the mind 
of Schrödinger, invented in his struggle to ﬁnd an understanding of the experimental 
observations of the real world” [7]. 
In this chapter, we will show that the Schrödinger equation can be derived more 
naturally from the quantum wave model. 
9.1.1 
Development of the Correspondence Rules 
In order to derive the Schrödinger equation, one needs to ﬁrst introduce the 
“correspondence rules” (see Table  9.1). Historically, these rules were developed 
based on the Hamiltonian framework in classical mechanics [8, 9]. We, however, 
think it is more natural to develop the quantum wave equation based on the analogy 
between the wave mechanisms of radiation wave (photon) and matter wave (massive 
particle) [10]. In this work, we proposed that both the photon and massive parti-
cles are quantized excitation waves of the vacuum; their wave function along the

These relations suggest that, if one wants to associate the particle property E and p

Physical Meaning of the Quantum Wave Function

From the above derivation, one can easily see the physical meaning of the quantum 
wave function of the Schrödinger equation. Its wave function left parenthesis psi Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisis directly related 
to the wave function of the Klein–Gordon equation left parenthesis phi right parenthesis; they differ only by a phase

, which describes the traveling wave of the electron. 
From the above discussions, we see that all known quantum wave equations can 
be derived based on the wave equation of the vacuum. In other words, particles 
of different types (i.e., photons, scalar particles, and electrons) are all excitation 
waves of the same vacuum medium; all quantum wave functions are associated with 
the longitudinal component (i.e., path component) of the vector potential Z (see 
Table 9.2).
9.2.1 
All Quantum Wave Equations Can Be Traced 
to the Wave Equation of the Vacuum 
In this work, we showed that in both the mechanical medium and the vacuum medium, 
the wave equations always appear as a 4-D Laplace equation. We call this equa-
tion the “Wave Equation of the Vacuum” (WEV) where the wave medium is the 
vacuum. We think all free particles are excitation waves of the vacuum medium, and

different particles are just different excitation modes. If the matter wave is described 
by the WEV, then different solutions of the WEV would represent different particles. 
These particles could have different mass or spin, but their wave functions should 
all satisfy the WEV. In the conventional theories, different particles are thought to 
satisfy different quantum wave equations. For example, the photon is supposed to 
satisfy the wave equation of light, the scalar particle is supposed to satisfy the Klein– 
Gordon equation, and the electrons are supposed to satisfy the Dirac equation (or 
the Schrödinger equation). In order to reconcile our matter wave model with the 
conventional quantum theories, one must demonstrate that all conventional quantum 
equations for different particles are derivable from the WEV. In Chaps. 7–9 of this 
book, we showed that this expectation can indeed be fulﬁlled. In other words, one 
could say that the WEV is the mother of all quantum wave equations. To demon-
strate this point more clearly, we have summarized the relationship between the wave 
equations and wave functions of different types of free particles in Table 9.3.

Transition from Classical Physics to Quantum 
Mechanics: The Mechanical View Versus the Wave View  
It is generally believed among physicists that classical mechanics is a limiting case 
of quantum mechanics. So, one should be able to derive the equation of motion in 
quantum mechanics by extending what we know from classical physics. There can 
be two different conceptual approaches for deriving the quantum wave equation: 
(1) The mechanical approach. Here, the physical system is treated as a dynamic 
system composed of many mechanical particles, with their positions and 
momentums speciﬁed by q’s and p’s. The formalism of quantum mechanics was 
developed based on classical Newtonian mechanics, particularly the Lagrange’s 
and Hamilton’s form of classical analytical mechanics. 
(2) The wave approach. Here, the system is treated as excitation waves in the 
vacuum. The formalism is wave mechanics based on the Maxwell theory. 
Historically, the mechanical approach was the mainstream view in quantum 
mechanics. However, this approach had great difﬁculties to explain certain quantum 
phenomena [11]. This is because the behavior of matter in the microscopic quantum 
system is different from the macroscopic mechanical world. For example, a particle’s 
position coordinate q and its conjugating momentum p cannot be accurately deﬁned at 
the same time. Also, the mathematical procedures in connecting classical mechanics 
to quantum mechanics are often complicated and must involve bold assumptions [9]. 
In this work, we proposed to use the wave approach to derive the quantum wave 
equations. Here, we showed that the transition from classical physics to quantum 
physics can be based on a conceptual uniﬁcation between light wave and matter 
wave. From the Maxwell theory and Helmholtz decomposition, one can derive not 
only the wave equation of photons, but also quantum wave equations for massive 
particles (e.g., electrons). The only assumption here is that both the matter wave and 
the radiation wave are excitation waves of the quantum vacuum [12]. 
In this approach, the quantum conditions come from the understanding that, like 
the photon, massive particles also obey the Planck’s relation and the de Broglie 
relation. For example, one can show p r igh t arrow minus i italic h over two pi partial differential slash partial differential xwhen it operates on a traveling

wave in the form of e Superscript i left parenthesis bold italic k dot bold italic x minus omega t right parenthesis. This  correspondence rule simply reﬂects the de Broglie 
relation bo l d italic p equals italic h over two pi bold italic k. Similarly, the correspondence rule up pe r E right arrow i italic h over two pi partial differential slash partial differential t is mainly a 
reﬂection of the Planck’s relation. 
There are further advantages in choosing the wave approach over the mechanical 
approach. For example, one can explain more easily the physical basis of particle 
creation/annihilation. If particles are excitation waves of the vacuum, the vacuum 
will be free of particles when it is at its resting state. Then, when the vacuum is 
excited with an energy stimulus, particles will be created due to the generation of 
new waves. Similarly, in the process of wave-wave interactions, some waves may 
be destroyed in order to create new waves. This may explain why particles can be 
converted into different types during interactions. 
By comparison, it is far more difﬁcult to explain particle creation/annihilation 
using the mechanical approach. In Dirac’s theory of the electron, the creation of an 
electron was based on an assumption that the vacuum is ﬁlled with a sea of inﬁnite 
number of negative-energy electrons [13]. When the system is stimulated with an 
energy input (such as the absorption of a γ ray), a negative-energy electron will gain 
energy and escape from the Dirac’s sea to become a positive-energy electron, while 
the hole left behind becomes the anti-particle (positron). Although this hypothesis 
could explain pair creation of electron/positron, its assumption is difﬁcult to be 
justiﬁed; there is no experimental evidence showing that the vacuum is ﬁlled with 
an inﬁnite number of negative-energy particles at the resting state [14].

Chapter Summary 
• Historically, the Schrödinger equation was derived by Erwin Schrödinger based 
on his conjecture in a classical mechanical view. It was very difﬁcult to explain 
the origin of the Schrödinger equation based on ﬁrst principle. In this chapter, 
we showed that the Schrödinger equation can be derived more naturally from the 
quantum wave model. 
• In order to derive the Schrödinger equation, one needs to ﬁrst introduce the 
“correspondence rules” (see Table 9.1). Historically, these rules were developed 
based on the Hamiltonian framework in classical mechanics. In this work, we 
proposed that both the photon and massive particles are quantized excitation 
waves of the vacuum; they obey the Planck’s relation and the de Broglie relation. 
Then, one can show that the correspondence rules simply reﬂect the operation of 
the de Broglie relation and the Planck’s relation on a traveling wave. 
• Once one knows how to develop the correspondence rules, one can derive the 
Schrödinger equation by following the example of using the correspondence rules 
to derive the Klein–Gordon equation. 
• The physical meaning of the quantum wave function of the Schrödinger equation 
is similar to the wave function of the Klein–Gordon equation; they differ only by 
a phase factor as shown in Eq. (9.11). In our model, all known quantum wave 
equations can be derived based on the wave equation of the vacuum. Particles

A New Understanding on Wave-Particle 
Duality: Comparing the Quantum Wave 
Model with the Copenhagen 
Interpretation and Other Alternative 
Models 
During the development of quantum mechanics, there was a dilemma in interpreting 
the physical meaning of the quantum wave function. In the mind of the traditional 
physicists, the electron is a physical particle (like a point mass); the quantum wave 
equation, on the other hand, can only describe the motion of a wave (matter wave). 
Thus, the physical identity of the two does not match! How to explain this dilemma 
becomes a big problem. 
One major idea to resolve this problem was the Copenhagen interpretation. Niels 
Bohr and his colleagues (including Heisenberg and Pauli) thought that the connection 
between the concepts of “particle” and “matter wave” can be through the statistical 
interpretation. That is, the electron would remain behaving as a classical particle 
(like a point mass), while the matter wave would give the probability of ﬁnding the 
electron at a particular position in space–time. 
Other leading scientists, including Einstein, Schrödinger, and de Broglie, however, 
did not agree with this statistical interpretation. They thought the matter wave should 
be a real physical wave. In fact, Einstein had several active debates with Bohr on this 
topic during the 1920s [1]. But neither man was able to convince the other. 
Subsequently, many physicists tried to propose alternative models to replace the 
Copenhagen interpretation; these include the pilot wave theory [2, 3] and the many-
world theory [4, 5]. These alternative theories, however, could not compete with the 
statistical interpretation proposed by Bohr. Today, the Copenhagen interpretation is 
still the leading theory for interpreting the quantum phenomenon of wave-particle 
duality. 
Now, with the development of the quantum wave model discussed in this book, 
we will show that one can have a better understanding of the wave-particle duality 
in comparison to the Copenhagen interpretation and its alternative models.

10.1 Bohr’s Statistical Interpretation Can Be Explained 
by the Quantum Wave Model 
Based on the understanding of our quantum wave model, one may say that both 
Einstein and Bohr could be partially right. From a philosophical point of view, 
Einstein’s thinking was in the right direction; he knew intuitively that the matter 
wave must be a physical wave. However, from a technical point of view, Bohr’s 
proposal was not unreasonable; his statistical interpretation can be quite useful for 
comparing quantum calculation with experimental results. In fact, it is possible to 
explain the statistical interpretation based on the quantum wave model presented in 
this book. 
10.1.1 
Why Can a Physical Wave Function Give 
the Probability of Detecting the Quantum Particle 
During Its Measurement? A Case Study Using 
the Photon as an Example 
Let us ﬁrst use a photon to demonstrate the above point. When a photon travels 
in the vacuum, it is in the form of a wave packet. As we pointed out earlier, the 
size of this wave packet is much larger than an atom (e.g., the size of the photon 
of visible light could be 104 times bigger than an atom).1 When one conducts an 
experiment to detect a photon, the photon can simultaneously interact with many 
atoms within the detector. However, only a single atom among them can absorb the 
entire quantum energy of the photon. This is due to the principle of all-or-none during 
the photon-absorption process [6]. (More speciﬁcally, the photon is absorbed by one 
single electron within this “lucky” atom). 
Therefore, there is a sudden change of energy distribution for the photon during 
the measurement process. Before the detection, the photon travels in the form of 
a wave packet; its energy is distributed over a relatively large volume (as large as 
the size of the wave packet). But as soon as the photon hits the detector, the entire 
quantum energy of the wave packet will suddenly be transferred into a single sub-
atomic electron. In another word, the wave packet of the photon suddenly collapses 
(into a sub-atomic size) during the measurement process (see Fig. 10.1). The photon 
is now appearing as a small dot on the screen, and thus can be interpreted as a tiny 
particle.
To demonstrate this conceptual interchange of wave and particle during the 
measurement process, we can use a well-known magical story as an analogy. In a
1 For example, a photon of visible light has a wavelength of about 0.5 µm. Since the photon is a 
wave packet, its width must be many times of its wavelength. Suppose the wave packet contains 
about 10 oscillating cycles, the wave packet will be about 0.005 mm long. Such a photon is about 
104 times bigger than an atom.

(photon) is an excitation wave of the vacuum; it travels as a wave packet. The size of this wave 
packet is far larger than an atom. During measurement, the entire photon is absorbed by a single 
electron inside the target atom. Thus, the energy of the wave packet is suddenly concentrated into 
a very small volume (of an electron) during the absorption process. In another word, the quantum 
wave function of the photon appears to collapse during a measurement, where the photon energy 
hv is transferred to the orbital electron to allow its energy level to jump from E1 to E2. Credit: This

famous novel called “One Thousand and One Nights”, there is a story about Aladdin 
and the magic lamp. Aladdin accidentally got a magic lamp, in which lived a magical 
genie. When Aladdin wiped the lamp, the genie would emerge from the lamp and 
appear as a giant (see Fig. 10.2). The giant genie is omnipotent; no matter what 
Aladdin wishes; the genie can help him to accomplish it. After the genie completed 
the requested task, he would shrink back into the lamp at once. The size of the 
returning genie is now much smaller than the lamp.
In the physical world, the behavior of a photon is almost like the magic genie 
in the above story. When a photon is emitted from an atom, the wave packet of the 
photon is about ten thousand times larger than the atom. When the photon is absorbed 
by an atom, all its energy is instantly transferred to an electron inside the atom. This 
process is like that the entire wave packet of the photon would suddenly collapse 
into a small volume. This is similar to the situation of the genie in the Aladdin story 
when it shrinks back into the lamp (see Fig. 10.2). 
Certainly, such magic performance of the photon is not due to the “magic power” 
as depicted in the Aladdin’s lamp story. It is really due to the “principle of all-
or-none” during energy transfer in the quantum world. That is, based on Planck’s 
discovery, light emission or absorption is in “quanta”; either the entire package of 
energy of the photon is transferred (between the atom and the vacuum), or no energy 
is transferred at all. 
By the way, there is one major difference between the photon emission/absorption 
and the magic lamp of Aladdin. In the Aladdin story, there was only one magic lamp;

Fig. 10.2 The analogy of photons being absorbed by electrons and the magic lamp story. 
The process of photons emission/absorption can be illustrated using an analogy from the story 
of Aladdin’s magic lamp. a When a photon is outside of an atom, its wave packet is hundreds 
of thousands of times larger than that of the atom. This situation is like the genie in the story of 
Aladdin’s lamp. When this genie emerged from the lamp, he was a giant and his size was far bigger 
than the lamp. b But when the genie ﬁnished the task and returned to the lamp, he would suddenly 
shrink to a small size and become a part of the lamp. It is a process of collapse, which is analogous 
to the process of photon absorption by an atom. When the photon is absorbed by the atom, all its 
energy is instantly transferred to one of the electrons inside the atom. It’s as if the photon’s wave 
packet collapsed into a tiny volume in an instant
the genie could come out from this lamp and later return to the same lamp. But in 
the photon emission/absorption case, there are many atoms in the quantum system, 
each of which is capable of emitting a photon. The emitted photon does not need to 
return to the original atom; it can be absorbed by any atom along its pathway. 
Because the photon wave packet is very large, many atoms inside the detector can 
interact with it. All of them will have a chance to absorb the photon. Which one can 
be the lucky atom? This involves a probability during the absorption process. 
It is not difﬁcult to see that the chance of an atom to absorb the photon is dependent 
on the relative position between the photon and the atom. For example, those atoms 
locating at the center of the photon wave packet would have a better chance of 
absorbing the photon. For those atoms located at the periphery of the wave packet, 
they would have less chance to absorb the photon. What is the factor that determines 
the probability of detecting the photon? It is most likely to be the energy carried by 
the excitation wave! In another word, those atoms that expose to the largest energy 
density of the wave packet would have a better chance to absorb the photon. 
It is not difﬁcult to calculate the energy distribution of a photon wave packet. From 
the Maxwell theory, we know the radiation energy is proportional to the square of 
the electric ﬁeld. Earlier, we have shown that E is proportional to Z, the amplitude 
of which is represented by the wave function ψ. Thus, the probability of detecting 
the photon is proportional to the square of the wave function, i.e.,

127
This relation is similar to the “Born rule” used in the Copenhagen interpretation, 
which proposed that the probability of detecting a quantum particle is proportional 
to the amplitude square of the wave function. 
10.1.2 
Similarly, the Probability of Detecting an Electron 
at a Particular Location Is also Related 
to the Amplitude of the Electron’s Wave Function 
From the above discussion, it is easy to see that a similar argument can be applied to 
an electron. According to our quantum wave model, the free electron is an excitation 
wave of the vacuum, just like the photon. When the free electron is traveling in the 
vacuum, it is in the form of a wave packet, the size of which is often bigger than 
an atom. For example, the electrons used in Davisson’s diffraction experiment had 
an energy in the order of 100 electron-volts. The wavelength of such an electron 
is about 1.2 × 10–8 cm. Since the wave packet of the free electron contains many 
cycles of oscillations, the length of the wave packet should be many times of the 
wavelength. Thus, the size of the electron wave packet is likely to be larger than 
10–7 cm. This would allow the free electron to interact simultaneously with many 
atoms in the detector. 
Once the incoming electron is captured by an atom in the detector, the electron 
wave packet will suddenly collapse and transfer its entire energy to the target atom. 
Due to the principle of all-or-none, the entire electron can only interact with a single 
atom within the detector. 
When one tries to measure the position of an incoming electron using a detector, 
the chance of detecting the electron by a particular atom is proportional to the energy 
density of the electron wave packet at the position of the target atom. According to 
our quantum wave model, the free electron is an excitation wave of the vacuum. The 
energy of the matter wave is proportional to the amplitude square of the electric vector 
potential, Z, which is represented by the wave function ψ. Thus, the probability of 
detecting the electron is proportional to the square of the wave function, i.e., 
Probability of detecting the electron at (x, t) tilde StartAb soluteValue bold italic upper Z left parenthesis bold italic x comma t right parenthesis EndAbsoluteValue squared equals StartAbsoluteValue psi left parenthesis bold italic x comma t right parenthesis EndAbsoluteValue squared
This relation is in good agreement with the “Born rule” used in the Copenhagen 
interpretation (see Fig. 10.3).
Hence, from a technical point of view, the statistical interpretation proposed by 
Bohr could be partially justiﬁed. However, its classical view of treating the electron 
as a point-mass-like particle is not correct. As we showed in the earlier chapters, the 
electron is an excitation wave of the vacuum; it is a physical wave. The collapse of 
the wave function during measurement is really due to the fact that, the absorption 
process of an electron wave must obey the principle of all-or-none (i.e., an atom can 
absorb either one whole electron or no electron at all).

10.2 The Statistical Interpretation Does Not Work 
for the Electron Wave Function Inside an Atom 
From the above discussion, one can see that, for an electron traveling outside of the 
atom, the quantum wave function can be related to the probability of ﬁnding the 
electron at a particular space and time. The situation, however, is very different 
for an electron inside an atom. According to the quantum wave model, the electron 
is a quantized wave packet; it is not a point mass. For an intra-atomic electron, the 
size of the electron wave packet is comparable to the size of the atom (see below). 
Thus, an intra-atomic electron could ﬁll most of the space inside an atom. Under 
this situation, it is not possible to specify the exact location of an electron within the 
atom. 
In the traditional literature, it is often stated that the “electron cloud” calculated 
based on quantum mechanics within an atom represents the probability of ﬁnding 
an electron at an inﬁnitesimal element of space surrounding a given point. This 
view is a misunderstanding. The Copenhagen interpretation cannot be applied for an 
intra-atomic electron due to the following reasons:

10.2 The Statistical Interpretation Does Not Work for the Electron Wave …
129
(1) The electron is not a point-mass-like object; it is a wave packet, the size of 
which is comparable to the atom. Thus, the electron cannot be localized in “an 
inﬁnitesimal element of space” within an atom. 
(2) There is no physical way to detect the presence of “an electron located within 
an inﬁnitesimal element of space within an atom”. Such measurement is 
impossible. 
(3) And because there is no measurement process to detect the location of an electron 
inside an atom, there is no “wave function collapse” (as observed when an 
external electron is absorbed by an atom). 
Therefore, our interpretation based on the quantum wave model is different from 
the traditional view. We think it is more reasonable to interpret the electron cloud 
as representing the charge distribution (of the electron) inside the atom instead 
of a probability of ﬁnding a point-mass-like electron at a particular inﬁnitesimal 
element of space. 
How does one know that the size of an intra-atomic electron is comparable to the 
size of an atom? First, one can estimate the longitudinal wavelength of an electron 
(lamda Subscript upper L) from the Bohr’s atomic model of hydrogen, 
2 pi r equa
ls n lamda Subscript upper L Baseline comma
where n = 1, 2, 3, … is a quantum number, r is the radius of the electron orbit within 
the atom. It can be shown from the Bohr’s model that [7]

Thus, even for the most inner orbital of the hydrogen electron, its radius is already 
comparable to the size of the hydrogen atom (its diameter is about 10–10 m). 
From Eq. (10.1), one can see that the longitudinal wavelength of the orbital elec-
tron is also comparable to the atomic size. Since the width of the electron wave packet 
is usually many times of its wavelength, one can estimate that the length of the wave 
packet representing the orbital electron is far greater than the length of the atomic 
orbit. 
Furthermore, the quantum wave function of the electron inside an atom (such as 
hydrogen) can be calculated directly using the Schrödinger equation. The results are 
well known [8–10]. The solution of the Schrödinger equation in the hydrogen atom 
(in polar coordinates) is given as

plot of the various quantum wave functions of electrons in a hydrogen atom based on 
the solutions of the Schrödinger wave equation. These wave functions are generally 
referred to as the “electron cloud” of the atom. 
From the above analysis, it is clear that the quantum wave function representing 
an intra-atomic electron is widely distributed. In fact, it can be shown from the 
solution of the Schrödinger equation that the size of the electron wave function is 
comparable to the size of an atom. According to the quantum wave model, the electron 
is a quantized wave packet; its wave function represents the dynamic variation of 
the vacuum medium as characterized by the electric vector potential Z. Thus, one 
should interpret the electron cloud as a physical distribution of charge density of the

electron instead of representing the probability of ﬁnding a point-mass-like electron 
at a particular location. 
In fact, this new interpretation of the electron cloud has several advantages. First, 
it can provide a physical basis to explain why two adjacent atoms cannot be pushed 
too close together (i.e., the Van der Waals force). Second, this can also explain 
the formation of molecular bonding between atoms. When two atoms form a bond 
between them, it is due to their sharing of the physical electronic wave functions. If 
their wave functions only represent probabilities, it would be difﬁcult to explain the 
physical mechanism behind the bonding. 
10.3 Controversy About the Different Interpretations 
of Quantum Mechanics 
10.3.1 
Skepticism About the Copenhagen Interpretation 
The Copenhagen interpretation has long been regarded as the orthodox explanation 
of quantum mechanics. It contains at least 4 major assumptions: 
(1) The quantum system is non-deterministic, instead, the quantum state of the 
system is only a superposition of multiple possible physical states. 
(2) The calculation based on the quantum wave equation only gives the probability 
of ﬁnding the particle at a particular physical state. 
(3) Before a measurement is made, the physical state of the system is unknown. 
When the measurement is made, the system will collapse into one of the possible 
physical states. 
(4) The probability of ﬁnding the quantum particle in a particular physical state 
is governed by the Born rule (i.e., the probability of ﬁnding the particle in 
a particular state is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave 
function). 
These assumptions need to be justiﬁed. In the above, we have pointed out that the 
points (2) and (4) of the Copenhagen interpretation can be easily explained using 
our quantum wave model. The points (1) and (3), however, are based not so much 
on the understanding of physics, but more on the philosophy of the physicists in 
the Copenhagen School. Some prominent physicists had expressed doubts about the 
probabilistic world implied by this Copenhagen interpretation. They believed that 
matter waves (the wave function in the Schrödinger equation) should be a real wave 
with physical properties, not just an elusive probability. 
Einstein was one of the most well-known critics of the Copenhagen interpretation. 
He had always been skeptical of the concept of probability waves; he had a famous 
saying “God does not throw dice” to dramatize his view. At two well-known Solvay 
conferences (in 1927 and 1930), he debated this issue vigorously with Bohr and 
others. According to Pauli’s recollection, Einstein once said: “One cannot build a

132
10

theory on many ‘possibles’. Even if the theory is empirically and logically right, it 
is actually wrong”. Heisenberg recalled that every morning at breakfast, Einstein 
would come up with a thought experiment to challenge Bohr’s quantum theory. By 
dinner time, Bohr and his collaborators would have presented counter-arguments and 
got Einstein to throw in the towel. The next day, Einstein would come up with new 
thought experiments to continue the challenge. In this cycle, the two sides debated 
for several days. But Einstein ultimately failed to convince Bohr [11]. 
Although Einstein could not win the debate with Bohr, he always believed that 
the statistical interpretation of quantum wave functions would not stand the test of 
time. Later at the Solvay Conference in 1930, Einstein engaged in a new round of 
debate with Bohr more openly at the conference. Although Einstein failed again, he 
was still not convinced [11]. 
Another well-known physicist, Schrödinger, was also not satisﬁed with the statis-
tical probability explanation advocated by the Copenhagen School. As the inventor 
of the quantum wave equation for electrons, he has always been interested in what 
the physical nature of matter waves is. In the 1930s, he had several exchanges with 
Einstein on this topic. Inspired by Einstein, Schrödinger proposed a “thought exper-
iment” to illustrate that the Copenhagen interpretation of the micro-world situation 
would contradict the macroscopic world observation [12]. Supposed that a cat is kept 
in a box containing a highly toxic gas; a control system in the box decides whether 
or not the gas is to be released. The switching of this control system depends on a 
quantum phenomenon (when a sample of isotopes decay in the box) (see Fig. 10.5). 
During this experiment, if the observer did not open the box, it was impossible for 
him to know whether the gas was being released, and whether the cat was alive or 
killed by the gas. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the state of the cat 
during the experiment is the superposition of the probabilities of the two states. It 
was as if the cat died at the same time and was alive at the same time. This cannot be 
true. When Schrödinger told Einstein about the idea, Einstein liked it a lot. Einstein 
called this problem “Schrödinger’s cat”, and thought the example pointed out the 
paradox of using the Copenhagen interpretation to explain quantum mechanics.
Of course, other mainstream physicists who supported the Copenhagen interpre-
tation could give a counter-argument. They said the outcome will only be known 
when the ﬁnal measurement is made. Only then does the wave function collapse 
into one of several possible states. Therefore, it is meaningless to discuss the results 
before taking the measurements. 
Quantum mechanics has been continuously developed and applied in the past 
century; its success is beyond doubt. But controversy over the interpretation of 
quantum wave functions has not stopped. Even today, many scientists are still not 
satisﬁed with the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics as proposed by the 
Copenhagen School. Particularly, many physicists are skeptical about Bohr’s assump-
tions of “superposition of states” and “the collapse of wave function upon measure-
ment”. Thus, they tried to propose alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics. 
Among them, the most well-known ones are the pilot wave theory proposed by de 
Broglie and Bohm, and the many-world interpretation proposed by Everett.

10.3 Controversy About the Different Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics

Fig. 10.5 Schrödinger’s cat. Suppose a cat is kept in a box containing poisonous gas stored in 
a glass bottle. There is a control mechanism in the box that decides whether to break the glass 
bottle or not. This control mechanism is triggered by a random event determined by the decay of a 
sample of radioactive isotope. Before the box is opened, it is impossible to know whether the gas 
was released or not, and thus, it is not certain whether the cat was alive or dead
10.3.2 
The Many-World Interpretation of QM 
A major dissatisfaction with Copenhagen interpretation is that before a measurement 
is made, the system is supposed to be a superposition of multiple quantum states, 
which are not reality. Now, when a measurement is made, the system suddenly 
collapses into one of the quantum states which now becomes real (i.e., observable). 
So there are two questions concerning this aspect of the Copenhagen interpretation: 
(1) Are the unobservable quantum states before measurement physically meaningful? 
(2) When the system collapses into one speciﬁc quantum state upon the measurement, 
what happen to the other quantum states? Where do they go? 
In the 1950s, a student of John Wheeler at the Princeton University, Hugh Everett 
III, proposed an idea to solve the above two problems in his Ph.D. thesis, entitled 
“Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics” [5]. He proposed that the entire 
universe is described by a gigantic wave function that contains within it an inﬁnite 
number of increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel quantum worlds. The  
universal wave function is objectively real, and all possible outcomes of quantum 
measurements are physically realized in some worlds. When an observer makes a 
measurement, he would only observe one of the possible physical results. The other 
possible quantum states are still there; they did not disappear upon measurement. 
They just go on with their own destiny in different worlds. Therefore, the wave 
function did not collapse upon measurement, it just made a choice of which world 
to go to. 
The Everett’s interpretation implies that there are an inﬁnite number of worlds 
coexisting at the same time. It is one of many multiverse hypotheses in physics 
and philosophy. The theory proposed by Everett was later renamed the Many-
World Interpretation (MWI) by Bryce DeWitt, who was responsible for making 
this interpretation of quantum mechanics more popular in the physics community.

MWI views time as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum 
outcome can be realized. The observer, of course, can observe only one of the 
outcomes in his chosen world. This interpretation is aimed to resolve the measure-
ment problem of the Copenhagen interpretation, such as the example of Schrödinger’s 
cat. The MWI would argue that in some worlds, the cat was alive, while in other 
worlds, the cat was dead. When the observer opens the box, he would discover the 
cat is either alive or dead, depending on which world he is going to branch into. 
When Everett presented his theory in 1956, he was totally rejected or ignored by 
the mainstream physicists [4, 13]. Subsequently, Everett left academia in 1956 and 
John Wheeler was not enthusiastic in promoting MWI at that time. However, in the 
1970s, MWI suddenly became more popular owing to the effort of DeWitt. In addi-
tion, several inﬂuential physicists, including David Deutsch and Sean Carroll, also 
helped to actively promote the MWI. As a result, MWI became more known in later 
days. There was indication that MWI is now the second-most popular interpretation 
of quantum mechanics, just behind the Copenhagen interpretation [14]. 
10.3.3 
The Pilot Wave Theory 
Another alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics is the so-called “pilot wave 
theory”, which was originally developed in the 1920s by de Broglie. He presented 
this pilot wave theory at the 1927 Solvay Conference but was criticized by Wolfgang 
Pauli. After that, de Broglie gave up this theory. Later, David Bohm, dissatisﬁed with 
the prevailing orthodoxy of the Copenhagen interpretation, rediscovered de Broglie’s 
pilot wave theory in 1952 [2, 3]. 
The pilot wave theory was developed to avoid the “measurement problem” found 
in the Copenhagen interpretation. In the pilot wave theory, it was hypothesized that 
the quantum system involves two separate but related components, i.e., the propaga-
tion of the wave function and the motion of the particle along its trajectory. The wave 
function only plays the role of guiding the motion of the particle. The movement of 
all particles is governed by the common physical laws. The evolution of the wave 
function over time, on the other hand, is given by the Schrödinger equation. 
The pilot wave theory is highly complicated and explicitly non-local: the velocity 
of any one particle depends on the value of the guiding equation, which depends on 
the conﬁguration of all the particles under consideration. Theoretically, the motion 
of one particle depends on the positions of all other particles in the universe. 
The pilot wave theory was rejected by most mainstream theorists, mainly because 
of its explicit non-locality. Many authors also expressed critical views of pilot wave 
theory by comparing it to Everett’s many-worlds approach. Since many proponents 
of pilot wave theory interpreted the universal wave function as physically real, one 
could interpret the pilot wave theory as having the same many worlds as Everett’s 
theory.

10.4 How Did These Different Theories Explain the Double-Slit Experiment …
135
In the Everettian view, the Bohm particles are superﬂuous entities. Everett’s 
comment on Bohm’s 1952 paper was: “Our main criticism of this view is on the 
grounds of simplicity—if one desires to hold the view that is a real ﬁeld, then the 
associated particle is superﬂuous, since, as we have endeavoured to illustrate, the 
pure wave theory is itself satisfactory” [4]. 
10.4 How Did These Different Theories Explain 
the Double-Slit Experiment for Electrons? 
10.4.1 
The Double-Slit Experiment 
The various theories discussed in the above are all aimed to explain the observations 
of wave-particle duality in quantum physics. One of the most clear-cut examples 
in demonstrating wave-particle duality is the double-slit experiment. Thus, one can 
illustrate the different approaches of the above theories by examining how these 
different theories explain the results of the double-slit experiment. 
In the double-slit experiment, a beam of electrons travel through a barrier that 
has two slits. If one puts a detector screen on the side beyond the barrier, one could 
observe an interference pattern of the detected particles. It shows interference fringes 
characteristic of waves arriving at the screen from two sources (the two slits). The 
interference pattern, however, is made up of individual dots corresponding to particles 
that had arrived on the detecting screen. If one modiﬁes this experiment so that one slit 
is covered by placing another detector behind it, no interference pattern is observed 
at the screen. Thus, the state of both slits affects the ﬁnal results. In this experiment, 
the system seems to exhibit the behavior of both waves (interference patterns) and 
particles (dots on the screen) (Fig. 10.6). 
Fig. 10.6 A double-slit experiment with electrons yields a pattern of interference fringes. 
From the known wave-particle duality property of electrons, Feynman proposed that if a double-slit 
experiment was performed with electrons, the pattern of interference fringes would emerge. Image

How did the different theories of quantum mechanics interpret the results of the 
double-slit experiment? 
Explanation by the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI). The Copenhagen interpre-
tation states that the particles are not localized in space until they are detected. 
Therefore, if no detector is placed at each slit, there is no information about which 
slit the particle has passed through. Since the particle detection is normally done at 
the detection screen behind both slits, its wave function is a superposition of two 
separated wave functions representing particles passing through either slit. So, the 
interference pattern is mainly caused by the superposition of wave functions; the 
dots on the detecting screen is caused by a collapse of the wave function during the 
measurement process. 
If one slit has a detector on it, then the wave function collapses due to that detection. 
In that case, the particles reaching the detecting screen behind the double-slit barrier 
can only go through the slit not blocked by the detector. 
Explanation by the Pilot Wave Theory (PW). In the pilot wave theory, the system is 
thought to involve two separate but related movements, i.e., the propagation of the 
wave function and the motion of the particle along its trajectory. The wave function 
plays the role of guiding the motion of the particle. The wave function is deﬁned at 
both slits, but each particle has a well-deﬁned trajectory that passes through exactly 
one of the slits. The ﬁnal position of the particle on the detector screen and the slit 
through which the particle passes is determined by the initial position of the particle. 
Such initial position is not knowable or controllable by the experimenter, so there is 
an appearance of randomness in the pattern of detection. 
In Bohm’s 1952 papers, he used the wave function to construct a quantum potential 
that, when included in Newton’s equations, gave the trajectories of the particles 
streaming through the two slits [2, 3]. In effect, the wave function interferes with 
itself and guides the particles by the quantum potential in such a way that the particles 
avoid the regions in which the interference is destructive and are attracted to the 
regions in which the interference is constructive, resulting in the interference pattern 
on the detector screen. 
Explanation by the Many-World Interpretation (MWI). In the many-world inter-
pretation, many quantum worlds can coexist at the same time; they are separated 
only when the measurement is taken. So, in the case of the double-slit experiment, 
there are particles that can pass through both slits. Because there is no measurement 
taken at the slit, it is not possible to know which slit the electron passes through. 
When the particle reaches the detecting screen, a measurement is taken place. The 
experimenter can observe only one of many possible results. That is, the measure-
ment only gives the result of one single electron passing through a speciﬁc slit. This 
does not mean that the electrons with different trajectories are absent, they simply 
just cannot be detected in this quantum world; they can be detected in other quantum 
worlds. 
Explanation by the Quantum Wave Model (QWM). In the quantum wave model 
discussed in this book, the explanation for the double-slit experiment is far simpler

than the traditional quantum interpretations. It proposes that the quantum particle 
(such as an electron) is a quantized excitation wave. When the electron travels in 
the vacuum, its wave packet has a relatively large size; it is large enough to allow 
the electron wave to travel through both slits. Thus, a single electron can interfere 
with itself. When the electron hits the detecting screen, the entire wave packet of the 
electron will be absorbed by a single atom at the screen. There is a sudden collapse 
of the wave function of the electron during the measurement process. This collapse 
is really due to the principle of all-or-none in the electron absorption process. 
10.5 Conclusion: Only the Quantum Wave Model Can 
Fully Explain the Quantum Phenomenon 
of Wave-Particle Duality 
In order to fully explain wave-particle duality, a quantum theory must be capable to 
address the following key questions in a convincing manner: 
(1) What is the physical meaning of the matter wave? Is it a physical wave or not? 
According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the matter wave is not a physical 
wave; it only has statistical signiﬁcance, i.e., it gives the probability of ﬁnding 
the particle. In that case, it is very difﬁcult to explain why a “probability wave” 
can propagate in the vacuum like a traveling object. What is the driving force 
for this “probability wave” anyway? 
(2) How to explain the wave behavior of the electron in the double-slit experiment? 
If one regards the electron as a point mass, how can a single electron pass 
through two separated slits to generate an interference pattern? 
(3) How to explain why an electron behaves like a particle at the detection screen 
in the double-slit experiment? 
(4) When a measurement is made, why does the probability of detecting the particle 
is proportional to the amplitude square of the wave function? 
(5) What is the physical basis of deriving the quantum wave equation for the matter 
wave? According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the matter wave is not a 
physical wave; it only represents the dynamic changes of the superposition of 
different quantum states. In that case, it is not possible to explain the physical 
basis of deriving the quantum wave equation. Can such a theory derive the 
Schrödinger equation based on the ﬁrst principle? 
From the discussion presented above in this chapter, one can see that only the 
quantum wave model can offer a logical basis to answer all ﬁve questions. (The 
comparison between different theories is summarized in the following Table 10.1). 
For example, in the case of Copenhagen interpretation (CI), although it can 
partially address Question #2 (by proposing a superposition of different quantum 
states), Question #3 (by proposing a collapse of the wave function during the measure-
ment process), and Question #4 (by assuming the Born rule), it fails to answer 
Questions #1 and #5.

In the case of the Many-World interpretation (MWI) and the Pilot Wave theory 
(PW), they have even more problems. Not only can’t they answer Questions #1 and 
#5, it is not clear that they are capable of addressing Question #2. Furthermore, 
these theories involved many artiﬁcial assumptions; their arguments were also very 
complicated and appeared to be unnatural. 
The quantum wave model (QWM), on the other hand, is very straightforward. It 
is based on the well-tested physical principles (i.e., the Maxwell theory, the quantum 
relations of Planck and de Broglie, and the Helmholtz decomposition theory). As 
we have shown in this chapter, the quantum wave model can directly address all 
key questions listed above. Furthermore, it has the advantage of simplicity and its 
assumptions and logic are far simpler than the other competing theories. Most impor-
tantly, the quantum wave model is the only model that can allow the quantum wave 
equation (the Schrödinger equation) to be derived based on the ﬁrst principle! (see 
Chaps. 7–9). 
10.6 Chapter Summary 
• Explaining wave-particle duality is an outstanding problem in quantum 
mechanics. Niels Bohr and his colleagues (including Heisenberg and Pauli) 
proposed that the connection between the concepts of “particle” and “matter 
wave” can be through statistical interpretation. That is, the electron would remain 
behaving as a classical particle (like a point mass), while the matter wave would 
give the probability of ﬁnding the electron at a particular position in space– 
time. This statistical interpretation can be quite useful for comparing quantum 
calculation with experimental results. 
• Such a statistical interpretation can be partially justiﬁed based on the quantum 
wave model presented in this book. When the free electron is traveling in the 
vacuum, it is in the form of a wave packet, the size of which is often bigger 
than an atom. Once the incoming electron is captured by an atom in the detector, 
the electron wave packet will suddenly collapse and transfer its entire energy to 
the target atom. Due to the principle of all-or-none, the entire electron can only 
interact with a single atom within the detector. The probability of detecting the

electron is proportional to the square of the wave function, in agreement with the 
“Born rule” used in the  Copenhagen interpretation. 
• The situation, however, is very different for an electron inside an atom. We showed 
that the electron cloud really represents the charge distribution (of the electron) 
inside the atom instead of a probability of ﬁnding a point-mass-like electron at a 
particular location. 
• Today, many scientists are still not satisﬁed with the orthodox Copenhagen 
interpretation. People are particularly skeptical about Bohr’s assumptions of 
“superposition of states” and “collapse of wave function upon measurement”. 
Thus, they tried to propose alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics. 
Among them the most well-known ones are the pilot wave theory proposed by de 
Broglie and Bohm, and the many-world interpretation proposed by Everett. 
• None of these theories, however, can offer a logical basis to fully explain the 
results of the double-slit experiment. Neither can they provide a physical basis to 
derive the quantum wave equation for the electron. At this time, only the quantum 
wave model can fully explain the quantum phenomenon of wave-particle duality. 
This model can also easily explain why the wave function suddenly collapses 
during a measurement.

The Physical Meaning of Mass and Energy 
From a Wave Perspective

Chapter 11 
Why Can Mass and Energy Be Converted 
Between Each Other? Energy, 
Momentum, and  Mass Have Geometrical 
Meanings in the Wave View 
In classical physics, energy and mass are totally different physical concepts. It was 
a great surprise when physicists in the twentieth century discovered that energy 
and mass can be converted between each other. What is the physical basis of this 
discovery? 
In popular science literature, it is often stated that the reason for mass-energy 
conversion is due to the special theory of relativity (STR). Such a claim, however, 
was a misunderstanding. Many recent reviews of the scientiﬁc literature had clearly 
shown that, the relation of mass-energy conversion had nothing to do with STR 
(see the session below and Appendix E). According to the quantum wave model 
discussed in this book, the reason for mass-energy conversion is due to the fact 
that the particle is a quantized excitation wave. 
This new understanding is not surprising. In fact, it offers a useful hint to explain 
how matter could be created in our world. The logic of this thinking is very simple: 
(1) Matter is made up of sub-atomic particles. 
(2) Sub-atomic particles are excitation waves of the vacuum medium. 
(3) Energy can be used to generate excitation waves. 
(4) Thus, energy can be converted to matter. 
In this chapter, we will explain in detail why the reason for mass-energy conversion 
is due to quantum physics instead of relativity. Furthermore, we will also try to answer 
the following questions: 
• What is the physical meaning of mass? 
• Why should mass be treated on the same footing as energy and momentum? 
• How can a wave have  mass? 
• What are the meanings of energy, momentum, and mass in the wave perspective?

Why Can Mass and Energy Be Converted Between Each Other? Energy …
11.1 
The Discovery of Energy-Mass Equivalence Was Not 
Based on Special Relativity 
The mass-energy equivalence relation E = mc2 is one of the most well-known 
formulas in modern physics. In many textbooks, this relation is often thought to be 
arisen from the principle of relativity (PR) [1–5]. Such thinking, however, was not 
correct; it does not stand up if one conducted a careful examination of the literature 
[6–12]. Although Einstein was an active supporter of the mass-energy equivalence 
idea, he was not the inventor of this concept. 
First, the concept of mass-energy equivalence had been suggested by many 
other scientists before Einstein proposed STR [13–17]. At the end of the nineteenth 
century, several European physicists had proposed that mass can be related to the 
energy-content of an object. For example, in 1881, J. J. Thomson showed that the 
magnetic ﬁeld generated by a moving charged sphere could induce an effective mass 
on the sphere [13]. Oliver Heaviside in 1889 further suggested that the effective 
mass m should be proportional to upper E divided by c squared [14]. Wien and Max Abraham called this 
the “electromagnetic mass” [18, 19]. The energy-mass relation up pe r E equals m c squared was ﬁrst 
mentioned by Poincare in a paper published in 1900 [16]. In 1904, Fritz Hasenöhrl 
also proposed the concept relating energy with mass in a series of papers entitled 
“On the theory of radiation in moving bodies” [20, 21]. According to W. Fadner, 
there were many discussions on the topic of mass-energy equivalence before 1905 
[8]. 
Second, Einstein’s arguments were not based on the principle of relativity; 
instead, his arguments for E = mc2 were mostly based on demonstrations in 
special hypothetical situations (he called them “thought experiments”) [3, 8–12]. 
For example, the ﬁrst publication of Einstein on this topic was a very short paper 
published in 1905, in which he considered an object sending out two identical pulses 
of light at opposite directions [22]. The energy of each of these light pulses is desig-
nated ½L as measured in the stationary frame S. After the emission of the light pulses, 
the total energy of the object was measured in the stationary frame S and moving 
frame S’. He argued that, the difference between the energy measured in the S and 
S’ frames is equal to the kinetic energy K of the object. Using the Taylor expansion 
and ignoring higher-order terms, he showed that, if a body gives off the energy L 
in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c2 [22]. (Details of this thought 
experiment and its critique are given in Appendix E). 
His derivation, however, had several problems: (1) It was not a general derivation, 
instead, it was a result obtained from a special hypothetical situation. (2) The obtained 
result E = mc2 was an approximation; it only applied when the moving speed of the 
object is much smaller than c. (3) His assumption that the total energy is a linear 
sum of the resting energy and the kinetic energy is incorrect for an object moving 
at high speed. (4) His hypothetical “thought experiment” was unrealistic; it cannot 
be performed in practice [9, 12]. (5) Finally, as pointed out by H. E. Ives, Einstein’s 
1905 paper on E = mc2 was based on a circular logic [7].

11.2 Why Mass and Energy Are Convertible? It is a Quantum Wave Effect
145
Third, Einstein was aware of the shortcomings of his derivation and thus wrote 
many more papers on this topic in the following years [23–29]. However, most 
of Einstein’s thought experiments had nothing to do with the principle of relativity; 
instead, they were mainly based on his intuitive thinking that radiation and 
matter could behave similarly [3, 12]. For example, Einstein proposed another 
thought experiment in 1906 based on a center-of-gravity argument [23]. (For details, 
see Appendix E). This thought experiment suggested that the radiation wave can 
have an effective mass equal to its energy divided by c2. 
In this thought experiment, Einstein’s derivation of the mass-energy relation was 
based on the idea that radiation wave can behave like a material object. His thought 
experiment actually violated the basic principle of STR, since it assumed the entire 
box move simultaneously when a burst of radiation wave was emitted from its left 
end at t = 0. That would imply that information can be transmitted faster than the 
speed of light. This problem was recognized by Einstein himself in his later paper 
[30]. 
Finally, a large number of historical reviews on the derivation of the mass-
energy relation had been published in recent years; they concluded that Einstein 
failed to derive the mass-energy relation [7–11]. For example, one review had 
explicitly pointed out that Einstein was aware of the shortcomings of his derivation 
(in 1905 and 1906) and tried to write more papers to patch things up but arguably 
never succeeded [11]. Recently, a series of elaborated reviews of Einstein’s attempt 
to derive the mass-energy relation was published by E. Hecht [9, 31]. His conclusion 
was that: “Einstein produced about 18 virtuoso derivations and demonstrations all 
aimed at establishing the mass-energy principle. … although each of them gave 
evidence for the applicability of E0 = mc2 to a particular set of circumstances, 
no one derivation, or collection of them taken together, succeeded in providing a 
deﬁnitive proof of its complete generality” [9]. According to Hecht, “The fact that 
Einstein continued to create demonstrations of the efﬁcacy of E0 = mc2 up to 1946 
tells us that he knew the deﬁnitive proof had not been accomplished” [9]. 
A detailed summary of recent reviews on the derivation of the relation E = mc2 
is given in Appendix E at the end of this book. For readers who are interested in this 
issue, this summary may provide a useful reference. 
11.2 
Why Mass and Energy Are Convertible? It is 
a Quantum Wave Effect 
One may then ask: If the relation of mass-energy equivalence was not derived from 
STR, what can be its physical basis? As we will show in the following, the concept 
of mass-energy equivalence is a consequence of quantum effect. More speciﬁcally, 
the mass-energy equivalence is really due to the fact that matter is made of 
quantized excitation waves [32].

11.2.1 
The Relation of Mass-Energy Equivalence for Photon 
is Clearly a Quantum Effect 
It can be easily shown that the relation of mass-energy equivalence for a photon is 
a consequence of its quantum property. We know photon and electron can behave 
as a particle as well as a wave. Such a wave property can make the particle behave 
differently from a point mass. This means that, a quantum object can have properties 
that are not found in classical mechanics. As shown in the following, if one treats the 
photon as a quantized wave packet, one can easily derive the mass-energy equivalence 
based on well-known quantum relations. 
Let us ﬁrst recall what the deﬁnition of “mass” is. From Newtonian mechanics, 
we know the mass (m) of an object is related to its momentum (p), 
p equal
s m v period
In the case of a photon, its speed is c. From the de Broglie relation, we know the 
momentum of a photon is p e quals italic h over two pi k. (Here italic h over two pi is Planck’s constant divided by 2π). So, 
the “mass” of a photon can be deﬁned as 
m equals p div
ided by c equals italic h over two pi k divided by c period
Since k equals 2 pi divided by lamda equals omega divided by c, using Planck’s relation, the above equation becomes 
m e quals italic  h over 
two pi k divided by c equals italic h over two pi omega divided by c squared equals upper E divided by c squared period
Hence, if one regards the quantized light wave as a particle, one can easily derive the 
mass-energy conversion relation of a photon, i.e., 
upper E e
quals m c squared period
In the case of a photon, its mass is the “effective mass”, not “rest mass”. Since 
this effective mass is derived from the particle’s momentum, we may call it the 
“inertial mass”. Recently, we demonstrated that this inertial mass is also equal to 
the “gravitational mass” of the photon [33]. 
Thus, at least in the case of a photon, one can easily show that the mass-energy 
equivalence is a consequence of the quantum relations of Planck and de Broglie. 
For particles with non-zero rest mass, it is more complicated to derive the mass-energy 
equivalence relation. Nevertheless, as shown in the following, such a relation can 
indeed be derived based on the wave properties of the particle.

The Physical Meaning of Mass: Mass Should Be 
Treated on the Same Footing as Energy 
and Momentum 
11.3.1 
Where Does Mass Come From? The Physical 
Meaning of Mass According to Newton 
What is the meaning of mass? This is an important question in the history of physics 
[10]. Newton is probably the ﬁrst one to give a scientiﬁc concept of mass. In his 
famous work “Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy” [34], he thought 
“mass” is “the quantity of matter”. He found that for any two objects, the ratio for 
their inertia and the ratio for their weight are the same. This implies that the inertia 
mass and the mass associated with weight are equal. Then, people could measure the 
mass of a body by determining its weight. 
Furthermore, Newton proposed that the weight of an object is just a measure of 
the gravitational force for that object. He thus concluded that the inertia mass and 
the gravitational mass are the same thing. 
In Newtonian mechanics, the mass is regarded as an intrinsic property of an object. 
Nowadays, the concept of mass is mainly deﬁned by relating it to momentum, that 
is, 
p equal
s m v period
Thus, mass has a clear meaning, that is, m is the proportional constant between 
the momentum p and the velocity v. Although this deﬁnition was originated from 
Newton, it is widely accepted by most physicists, including Einstein.

How Can a Wave Have Mass? 
11.4.1 
The Meaning of Mass in the Wave View 
As we stated earlier, one great discovery in modern physics is that an elementary 
particle can sometimes behave like a wave. In the case of photon, there is no doubt 
that it is a light wave. But even for particles with rest mass, such as electrons or 
neutrons, they can also behave like a wave. Then, one must ask: How can a wave 
have mass? 
This question can be answered if one accepts the deﬁnition of mass as outlined in 
Eq. (11.1), i.e., “mass” is only the proportional constant between p and bold italic v. We know 
that the quantum wave representing a particle has a momentum which is proportional 
to the wave number k:

p e qua

where k = 2 pi divided by lamda(lamdais the wavelength). We also know that a wave packet has velocity, 
that is its group velocity, which is given as 
v equals StartFraction d omega Over d k EndFraction period
v eq
uals StartFraction d omega Over d k EndFraction period
The energy of the quantum wave packet is proportional to its frequency, i.e., 
upp er 
E equals italic h over two pi omega period
We can calculate v easily once we know the dispersion relation of the quantum wave 
packet (i.e., omega  equals omega left parenthesis k right parenthesis). Substituting Eqs. (11.5) and (11.6) into Eq. (11.1), we have 
m eq uals StartFraction p Over v EndFraction equals italic h over two pi k divided by StartFraction d omega Over d k EndFraction period
m e quals StartFraction p Over v EndFraction equals italic h over two pi k divided by StartFraction d omega Over d k EndFraction period
m eq
uals StartFraction p Over v EndFraction equals italic h over two pi k divided by StartFraction d omega Over d k EndFraction period
Thus, the mass can be calculated explicitly. This explains why a quantum wave packet 
can have mass. 
From the above equation, it is easy to see that mass is not necessarily a constant. 
Since the dispersion relation omega  equals omega left parenthesis k right parenthesisis not linear in general, m is a function of k 
according to Eq. (11.8). That means the mass should vary with momentum change. 
Thus, it is not a mystery that the mass of a particle would change with speed. Instead, 
it is a natural expectation if one accepts that the particle is a quantized excitation 
wave.

Origin of the Energy–Momentum Relation 
of a Quantum Particle 
11.5.1 
In the Teaching of Relativity, the Rest Mass is Simply 
an Integration Constant for Deriving 
the Energy–Momentum Relation 
As we pointed out in the earlier parts of this chapter, although Einstein knew that 
E is related to mc2, he was not able to derive the mass-energy equivalence relation 
from ﬁrst principle. Furthermore, his 1905 STR paper gave the wrong prediction 
for the speed-dependence of mass [35]. He failed to derive the correct relation of 
m equa
l
s m 0 left parenthesis 1 minus v squared divided by c squared right parenthesis Superscript negative 1 divided by 2. But today, many textbooks of relativity proclaim otherwise. 
They somehow maintain that both the mass-energy equivalence relation and the 
speed-dependence of mass are derived from STR.

11.5 Origin of the Energy–Momentum Relation of a Quantum Particle
149
How could they do that? The trick of these textbooks is to ignore Einstein’s 
original argument in 1905 and invented alternative ways to obtain the correct relation 
of mass-energy equivalence (or speed-dependence of mass). Their derivations often 
have nothing to do with STR. 
As a demonstration of this new argument, let us brieﬂy review the derivation of 
these so-called “relativistic relations” in some current standard textbooks. A widely 
used textbook (which is part of The MIT Introductory Physics Series) is  Special 
Relativity by A.P. French [3]. Its derivation of the relation E = mc2 is given in its 
Chap. 1, before the principle of relativity is taught. In the following, let us summarize 
the essential steps of its derivation. 
Its derivation starts by pointing out that, for a photon, its energy–momentum 
relation is 
StartLa

Then, one can get
d up p er E equals c d p period
By multiplying both of these equations together, one has 
u pp er E d  up
per E equals c squared p d p period
Although the above relation was derived from the energy–momentum relation of 
light, the author argued that this same relation is also valid for matter [3]. By 
integration of Eq. (11.10), one can obtain, 
up er E squ ared 
equ
als c squared p squared plus upper E 0 squared comma
where up
er E 0 squared is a constant of integration. 
Recall that the particle speed is v eq uals StartFraction partial differential upper E Over partial differential p EndFraction
v equals StartFraction partial differential upper E Over partial differential p EndFraction. One can differentiate both sides of 
Eq. (11.11) with respect to p and obtain 
v equals StartFraction partial differential upper E Over partial differential p EndFraction equals StartFraction c squared p Over upper E EndFraction period
v e quals  StartFraction partial differential upper E Over partial differential p EndFraction equals StartFraction c squared p Over upper E EndFraction period
v e

At low speed (v  much less than c), upper E right arrow upper E 0, the above equation becomes 
p eq uals StartFraction upper E 0 Over c squared EndFraction v period
p e qu

Since we know at low speed, the momentum is equal to the rest mass times the 
velocity, 
p equals

from the above two equations, one can get

m 0  e quals StartFraction upper E 0 Over c squared EndFraction period
m 0  
equals StartFraction upper E 0 Over c squared EndFraction period
This suggests that upper E 0 divided by c squared is playing the role as a “rest mass”. So, m 0 is just a measure 
of the resting energy upper E 0, which, is originally an integration constant of the E versus 
p relation. 
From the above relation, one can get the mass-energy relation in the more familiar 
form, 
up er E 0 eq
uals m 0 c squared period
From this summary, one can see that, the classical derivation of the energy-mass 
relation is not really based on the principle of relativity. Instead, it is based on a 
conceptual assumption that the variation of E vs p can be similar between matter 
and radiation. It only demonstrated that the rest mass is related to an integration 
constant of the E versus p relation. 
11.5.2 
In the Quantum Wave Model, the Energy–Momentum 
Relation of a Particle Is Originated 
from the Dispersion Relation of the Quantum Wave 
Function 
From the above, one can see that, in the derivation given in the relativity textbooks, 
the rest mass of an object is just an integrating constant in the energy–momentum 
relation; it has no clear physical meaning. This is not very satisfactory. In contrast, 
the rest mass in the quantum wave model has a clear physical meaning. As we  
showed in Chap. 7, the energy–momentum relation of a particle originated from 
the dispersion relation of the quantum wave packet. In that case, the rest mass m0 
is related to an effective “wave number” in the direction perpendicular to the 
particle’s trajectory. This “wave number” is characterized by the parameter script l which 
describes the lateral oscillation motion of the quantum wave function. This ﬁnding is 
consistent with our new understanding that mass, energy, and momentum should be 
treated on the same footing. It is well known that energy and momentum are related 
to the frequency and wave vector, it is not surprising that mass could be related to a 
“wave number”. 
Recall that from Chap. 7, the quantum wave function describing a massive particle 
is given in Eq. (7.16), which contains several wave parameters, ω, k, and script l. Here, ω 
and k are the frequency and wave vector of the traveling longitudinal wave, while script l
is the transverse wave number characterizing the oscillation of the Bessel function, 
which describes the movement of the vacuum medium in the transverse direction. 
The dispersion relation of the quantum wave function is

which is exactly the so-called “relativistic energy–momentum relation” of a  
massive particle. Of course, our derivation was based on the quantum wave nature 
of the particle instead of relativity. So, this relation should be more correctly 
called “quantum energy–momentum relation”, or “energy–momentum relation” of a  
quantum particle. 
Furthermore, by combining the above two equations with p eq uals m v, one can 
directly show that the total energy of a particle is proportional to its moving mass, 
upper E e
quals m c squared period
Thus, this demonstrated that the mass-energy equivalence relation really originated 
from the wave properties of the particle. In addition, from the energy–momentum 
relation as expressed in Eq. (11.25), it is obvious that, when the particle is at rest (p 
= 0), the rest-energy of a particle is proportional to its rest mass, i.e., 
up er E 0 e
quals m 0 c squared period
Hence, the mass-energy equivalence relation is not only applicable for a photon, as 
we showed earlier, it also holds for a particle with non-zero rest mass. 
11.6 
Energy, Momentum, and Mass Are All Related 
to the Curvature of Bending the Vacuum Medium 
From the above discussion, it is apparent that the resting energy uper E 0 is contributed 
solely from the rest massm 0, which in turn is related to the parameter script l in the wave 
function. This provides a very useful hint about the physical nature of the rest mass. 
This in fact suggests that the rest mass could be related to a geometrical property of 
the vacuum. 
To understand this point, let us ﬁrst review the physical nature of energy and 
momentum according to the view of wave-particle duality. From the Planck’s relation 
and the de Broglie relation, it is easy to see that the energy and momentum of a 
free particle are related to the periodicity of oscillation of the vacuum medium. 
More speciﬁcally, from up p er E equals italic h over two pi omega, we know energy is related to the periodicity 
of oscillation in the time dimension, and from p e quals italic h over two pi k, momentum is related to 
the periodicity of oscillation in the spatial dimension along the direction of the 
trajectory. Our ﬁnding that m 0 equals italic h over two pi script l divided by c 
suggests that the rest mass can be associated 
with some sort of oscillation periodicity too. Indeed, from Eq. (7.16), we know that 
the transverse component of the free particle wave function is described by a Bessel 
function, the asymptotic form of which is

(The variation of Bessel function for n = 0 is shown in Fig. 11.1.) Thus, script l can be 
regarded as the “transverse wave number” of the free particle, i.e., it is the inverse 
of the wavelength in the transverse oscillation, s cr ipt l equals 2 pi divided by lamda Subscript upper T (see Fig. 11.1). Thus, 
Eq. (11.23) means that the rest mass of a particle is associated with the oscillation 
periodicity of the wave function in the transverse plane. 
This result appears to make very good sense. In essence, our analysis suggests 
that energy, momentum, and mass are all related to the oscillations of the 
quantum wave function, which characterize the curving of the vacuum medium 
in different dimensions. More speciﬁcally, if one uses the natural unit (c = 1), one 
can see:

These imply that, the energy (E) is inversely proportional to the wavelength in the 
time dimension; the momentum (p) is inversely proportional to the wavelength in the 
longitudinal spatial dimension; and the rest mass (m0) is inversely proportional to the 
wavelength in the transverse spatial dimension. Since “the inverse of wavelength” is  
a measure of the curvature of bending the wave medium, the above results suggest 
that, the particle properties including energy, momentum, and rest mass, are  all  
related to the curvature of bending the vacuum medium during the propagation 
of the excitation wave. Such bending curvatures are just taking place in different 
dimensions.

Why Can Mass and Energy Be Converted Between Each Other? Energy …
This ﬁnding is highly interesting. We know both energy and mass must be created 
by “work”. When there is no excitation wave, there is no stress in the vacuum medium; 
its curvature is zero. When an excitation wave emerges, it creates stress at a local 
region of the vacuum medium. Since it takes work to bend the wave medium, the 
larger the bending curvature, more work is required. This is true for bending the 
medium in all dimensions (spatial and temporal). Thus, a shorter wavelength of a 
propagating wave should always associate with a higher “energy state”, which may 
be reﬂected in an increase in energy, momentum, or “mass” of the excitation wave. 
11.6.1 
The Resting Energy and the Kinetic Energy 
of a Single Particle Appear to Form 
a Two-Dimensional Hilbert Space 
The energy–momentum relation as given in Eq. (11.25) provides an important insight 
about the physical nature of energy of a free particle. Namely, it suggests a special 
geometrical linkage between the particle energy and its momentum and rest mass. 
For a moving particle, there are two types of energies associated with it: (1) The 
“kinetic energy”upper E Subscript upper K, which associates with the momentum, i.e., upp er E Subscript upper K Baseline equals c p, and (2) 
The “resting energy” up er E 0 equals m 0 c squared, which is the intrinsic energy of a particle that does 
not depend on its momentum. However, the total energy of the particle (E) is not 
a linear combination (algebraic sum) of upper E Subscript upper K and upper E 0, instead, they form a triangular 
relationship following the Pythagoras law, i.e., 
up er  E squ ared 
eq uals

This suggests that the kinetic energy upper E Subscript upper K and the resting energy uper E 0 form a two-
dimensional Hilbert space. The particle energy (E) is a vector sum of upper E Subscript upper K and uper E 0
(see Fig. 11.2).

rical relationship between the wave parameters ω, k, and script l. (Here we use the natural unit, c = 
1)

11.7 How Can an Excitation Wave Behave Like a Particle?
155
This relationship can be understood easily from a wave perspective. Recall that 
Eq. (11.25) was derived from the dispersion relation of a free particle, i.e., Eq. (11.17). 
Using the natural unit (c equals 1), the dispersion relation can be rewritten as 
left p arenthes is italic
 h over two pi omega right parenthesis squared equals left parenthesis italic h over two pi k right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis italic h over two pi script l right parenthesis squared period
It suggests that èω is a “vector sum” of two perpendicular vectors with amplitudes 
equal to èk and èscript l (see Fig. 11.2b). We know k is the wave vector parallel to 
the trajectory of the particle, while script l is a “wave number” that characterizes the 
oscillation of the wave function in a plane transverse to k. Thus, the directions of 
oscillations in the vacuum characterized by k and script l apparently are associated with 
two perpendicular axes. We have demonstrated that italic h over two pi script l is associated with the rest 
mass and thus the resting energy, and, from the de Broglie relation, we know that italic h over two pi k
is associated with momentum and thus the moving energy. Hence, it is not surprising 
that the resting energy uper E 0 and moving energy upper E Subscript upper K may form a two-dimensional 
Hilbert space. Naturally, their vector sum becomes the total energy of the particle. 
This provides a simple explanation to the physical nature of the mechanical prop-
erties of a particle [37]. This geometrical interpretation suggests that the physical 
natures of energy and mass are very similar; they are all related to the curvatures 
of bending the wave medium. There is no wonder why energy and mass can be 
converted between each other. 
11.7 
How Can an Excitation Wave Behave Like a Particle? 
Based on the discussion in this chapter, we believe that at the quantum level, all 
particles are excitation waves of the vacuum medium. Thus, not only photons, but all 
sub-atomic particles, including electrons, protons, neutrons, etc., are all quantized 
wave packets. Because their creation and annihilation must follow the “principle of 
all-or-none”, they look like individual particles. 
11.7.1 
The “Quantum” Phenomenon is Just a Manifestation 
of the “Principle of All-or-None” 
Let’s ﬁrst review what a “quantum phenomenon” is. As we mentioned in Chap. 3 of 
this book, the discovery of quantum phenomena began with Planck’s work on black-
body radiation. Planck discovered that the radiant energy of light is not distributed 
continuously, but consists of many undividable small units. The smallest unit of 
this radiated energy is called a “quantum” of light. From the results of these works, 
it is believed that light transfers energy from one object to another in the form of 
“photons”. That is, it seems that light is transmitted in the form of “particles”.

156
11
Why Can Mass and Energy Be Converted Between Each Other? Energy …
A few years later, when Einstein studied the photoelectric effect, he discovered 
that when an electron in an atom absorbs the energy of light, it also has a smallest 
unit; this smallest unit is equal to the quantum of light discovered by Planck. So, 
when an atom is illuminated with light, the electrons inside it either absorb the entire 
quantum energy of a photon, or they do not absorb any light energy at all. 
Conversely, when an electron inside an atom jumps from a high-energy level to a 
low-energy one, it produces a photon. And the energy of the photon is exactly equal 
to the potential energy difference between the two levels of the electron. That is to 
say, all the energy released by the electron goes to the newly generated photon. 
Thus, in nature, light behaves in a quantum form. In this process, the light energy 
involved has a smallest unit (that is, a “photon”) and cannot be sub-divided. We can 
say that the energy contained within the photon shares the same destiny: either to live 
or to die together. Thus, either the entire photon is absorbed by a quantum particle 
(such as an electron), or it is not absorbed at all. In another word, a photon is like a 
digital object; it can only exist in two states, either “1” or “0”. 
Thus, the quantized light wave can be regarded as a kind of “particle”. In fact, this 
is not only true for photons, but also for electrons. The same goes for the electron’s 
anti-particle, the positron. We can even generalize this conclusion to all particles in 
the universe. 
Furthermore, not only the creation and annihilation of the quantized excitation 
wave is “particle-like”, the wave packet can also have particle properties such as 
energy,momentum, velocity,andmass(see Fig. 11.3). It is well known that the velocity 
of the quantized excitation wave is equal to the group velocity of the wave packet. 
We have also shown earlier in this chapter that the wave packet has an effective mass 
which is equal to the ratio between its momentum and speed. In the macroscopic view, 
this effective mass behaves just like the inertial mass of a mechanical object. In fact, 
we showed recently that such an effective mass can generate the same gravitational 
effect as the gravitational mass of an object [33].
Since the excitation wave of the vacuum can have well-deﬁned particle properties, 
including energy, momentum, velocity, and mass, it will look like a particle in the 
macroscopic view (i.e., in the classical limit) (see Fig. 11.3). 
11.7.2 
There is a One-to-One Correspondence Between 
the Particle Properties and the Wave Properties 
One nice thing about the wave model is that it makes things very simple. In the 
quantum wave model, a particle is a quantized excitation wave of the vacuum. One can 
look at a quantum particle from two different perspectives, i.e., either from a particle 
view or from a wave view. For the particle view, one can talk about the energy of the 
particle, the momentum of the particle, and the rest mass of the particle. But for a 
wave view, one can talk about the frequency, the wave vector, and the transverse wave 
number. (The “transverse wave number” is the oscillation in the transverse plane.)

11.8 Chapter Summary
157
Fig. 11.3 Wave-particle duality. There is a one-to-one correspondence between particle properties 
and wave properties in the quantum view
From the discussions above, one can easily see that, there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between the particle properties and the wave property (see Fig. 11.3 above). 
For example, energy is related to the frequency, and the rest mass m0 is related to the 
transverse oscillation of the wave packet. Therefore, energy, momentum and mass 
are basically the same thing. All of them are a measure of the curvature of bending 
the vacuum medium. The physical properties of a particle now have their own 
geometrical meanings! Naturally, a sharper bending of the medium is associated 
with more work, and thus requires more energy. These geometrical relations explain 
why mass and energy are equivalent.

Chapter Summary 
• The discovery of energy-mass equivalence was not based on special relativity. 
According to recent literature reviews, Einstein failed to derive the mass-energy 
relation based on STR (see Appendix E). 
• Why mass and energy are convertible? It is a quantum wave effect. The relation of 
mass-energy equivalence is really due to the fact that matter is made of quantized 
excitation waves. In the case of a photon, one can easily show that the mass-energy 
equivalence relation is a consequence of the quantum relations of Planck and de 
Broglie. For particles with non-zero rest mass, we can also show that the mass-
energy equivalence relation is derived from the wave properties of the quantum 
particle.

Why Can Mass and Energy Be Converted Between Each Other? Energy …
• Mass should be treated at the same footing as energy and momentum. In Newtonian 
mechanics, mass is regarded as an intrinsic property of an object. The concept of 
mass is mainly deﬁned by relating it to momentum, that is, m is the proportional 
constant between the momentum and the velocity. 
• What is the physical meaning of mass? In the teaching of relativity, the rest mass is 
simply an integration constant for deriving the energy–momentum relation. In the  
quantum wave model, the energy–momentum relation of a particle is originated 
from the dispersion relation of the quantum wave function. Mass is related to a 
wave property. 
• Our analysis suggests that energy, momentum, and mass are all related to the 
oscillations of the quantum wave function, which characterize the curving of 
the vacuum medium in different dimensions. More speciﬁcally, the energy (E) is  
inversely proportional to the wavelength in the time dimension; the momentum (p) 
is inversely proportional to the wavelength in the longitudinal spatial dimension; 
and the rest mass (m0) is inversely proportional to the wavelength in the transverse 
spatial dimension. Since “the inverse of wavelength” is a measure of the curvature 
of bending the wave medium, the above results suggest that particle properties 
including energy, momentum, and rest mass, are all related to the curvature of 
bending the vacuum medium during the propagation of the excitation wave. 
• How can an excitation wave behave like a particle? The  “quantum” phenomenon 
is just a manifestation of the “principle of all-or-none”. Since the excitation 
wave of the vacuum can have well-deﬁned particle properties, including energy, 
momentum, velocity, and mass, it will look like a particle in the macroscopic view.

How to Resolve the Conﬂict Between 
Quantum Physics and Relativity?

Chapter 12 
The Quantum Origin of the So-Called 
“Relativistic Relations” 
As shown in many textbooks, the foundation of modern physics is built on two theo-
ries, i.e., quantum mechanics (QM) and the special theory of relativity (STR). These 
textbooks, however, often fail to mention that there is a major conﬂict between QM 
and STR; their assumptions about the vacuum are totally different. According 
to STR, the vacuum must be empty; otherwise, it will provide a reference frame 
to determine which inertial frame is stationary and which one is not. This would 
violate the principle of relativity. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, requires 
the vacuum to be not empty. The vacuum is regarded as the ground state of the 
quantum system; it has very rich physical properties. Thus, the vacuum cannot be 
empty as assumed in the STR. 
Now, we are facing with a dilemma: Do we chose to believe QM or STR? Or, 
can we ﬁnd some way to reconcile between the two? In this chapter, we will show 
that many of the so-called “relativistic effects” can indeed be explained based on 
quantum physics. 
In classical physics, our physical world is described using Newtonian mechanics. 
However, it was discovered in the early twentieth century that the movement of sub-
atomic particles (e.g., photon and electron) appears to follow different rules. These 
observed deviations from Newtonian mechanics were often attributed to be due to 
relativity. It was claimed that the physical concepts used in the Newtonian mechanics 
are only low-speed approximations; they are no longer valid when the speed of the 
object is increased to approach the speed of light. Thus, many physicists called these 
non-Newtonian relations “relativistic relations”. 
This conclusion, however, is a misinterpretation. It fails to recognize that the 
sub-atomic particles behave differently from Newtonian mechanics is because the 
quantum physics in the microscopic world is different from the classical physics 
in the macroscopic world. For the sub-atomic particles, the observed deviation 
from Newtonian mechanics was not due to relativity. Instead, it is because the 
quantum particles making up matters are excitation waves.

The Quantum Origin of the So-Called “Relativistic Relations”
In this chapter, we will examine in detail the physical basis of the various so-called 
“relativistic relations”. We will show that these relations have a clear root in quantum 
physics. 
12.1 The Quantum Basis of the So-Called “Relativity 
Relations” 
In the last chapters, we had shown that the relation of mass-energy equivalence 
was not arisen from relativity; instead, it is a direct consequence of the fact that 
the quantum particle is an excitation wave of the vacuum. Furthermore, the so-called 
“relativistic energy–momentum relation” is really arisen from the dispersion relation 
of the quantum wave function. 
In the following, we will show in detail that the other so-called “relativistic rela-
tions” are also due to the wave nature of the quantum particles. At present, there 
are many important questions about fundamental physics, including: (1) Why is the 
speed of light constant? (2) Why can no particle travel faster than light? (3) Why is 
the mass of a particle not constant? Why is mass speed-dependent? These questions 
are often explained using STR. In this chapter, we will show that the above questions 
can be explained more easily based on the quantum wave model. 
12.2 Why is the Speed of Light Constant? 
One advantage of the quantum wave model is that it can provide a clear physical basis 
to explain why light must travel at a constant speed of c and no particle can travel 
faster than c. In classical mechanics, the vacuum is just an empty space. In principle, 
a particle (including photon) should be able to travel at any speed. Also, the speed of a 
particle should appear to be different in different moving frames. The results of many 
light speed measurement experiments, however, indicated that the speed of light is 
constant [1, 2]. Furthermore, results of Michelson-Morley experiment suggested that 
the speed of light appears to be the same in all inertial frames [3]. These observations 
are not consistent with the general expectation of a classical mechanical system. 
In order to make his relativity theory agree with the experimental results, Einstein 
simply assumed that light must travel at a constant speed c in all inertial frames. He 
did not know the physical basis of this assumption, so he just called it a “postulate” 
[4]. 
In our quantum wave model, there is no need to assume that the speed of light 
is a constant, since this is a prediction of the theory. Here, the photon is just a 
quantized excitation wave. Like all waves, its traveling speed is determined by the 
physical properties of the wave medium. The wave equation of light was derived 
from the Maxwell’s equations. The velocity of the excitation waves in the vacuum

12.3 Why Can No Particle Travel Faster Than Light?
165
is c equals 1 divided by StartRoot mu 0 epsilon 0 EndRoot√c e quals 1 divided by StartRoot mu 0 epsilon 0 EndRoot . Hence, c is entirely determined by the physical properties of the 
vacuum medium. Because the Maxwell equation of light transmission is Lorentz 
invariant, it remains the same form in different inertial frame. The value of c does 
not change with the transformation. Thus, the speed of light should be the same 
in all inertial frames. Therefore, the postulate of STR about the constant speed of 
light is not a truly required “postulate”; it can be predicted based on Maxwell’s 
electromagnetic theory of light. 
12.3 Why Can No Particle Travel Faster Than Light? 
In the STR, it requires that no particle can travel faster than the speed of light, 
otherwise the theory would breakdown. However, one needs to give a physical reason 
to justify why a particle cannot travel faster than light. In STR, Einstein simply 
regarded that as a conjecture; he just hypothesized that Nature somehow does not 
allow any object to travel faster than the speed of light. 
The quantum wave model, on the other hand, clearly predicts that no particle can 
travel faster than the speed of light. The reason is because all particles are quantized 
excitation waves of the vacuum medium. Their speed of transmission is entirely 
determined by the physical properties of the wave medium. Since all particles are 
excitation waves of the same medium (i.e., the vacuum), they must have the same 
speed limit. 
This point can be easily demonstrated mathematically using the results we 
obtained in Chap. 7. Because the particle is a wave packet, we know its traveling 
speed is its “group velocity” instead of its “phase velocity”. The group velocity is 
determined by partial differential omega divided by partial differential kand is generally slower than the phase velocity left parenthesis omega divided by k right parenthesis. 
For photon, its dispersion relation is given by Eq. (7.9), 
omega equals c k period
Its group velocity happens to be the same as its phase velocity, c equals 1 divided by StartRoot mu 0 epsilon 0 EndRoot√c equals 1 divided by StartRoot mu 0 epsilon 0 EndRoot. Thus, 
the photon always travels at the speed c. 
For particles with non-zero rest mass, their energy–momentum relation is based 
on the dispersion relation of the excitation wave, which is given in Eq. (7.14), 
ome g

 sq u are
d eq
uals left parenthesis k squared plus script l squared right parenthesis c squared comma
where script l is proportional to the rest mass. From this dispersion relation, one can directly 
calculate the traveling speed of the particle, which is equal to the group velocity of 
the wave packet, i.e., v equals StartFraction partial differential omega Over partial differential k EndFraction
v equals StartFraction partial differential omega Over partial differential k EndFraction. From Eq.  (12.1), its group velocity is

The Quantum Origin of the So-Called “Relativistic Relations”
For a massive particle, m 0 not equals 0; according to Eq. (11.23), s cript l not equals 0. This explains why 
the speed of a massive particle is not constant and its maximum speed cannot exceed 
the speed of light, c. 
Thus, particles in general must travel at a speed less than the speed of light (c); 
and c is the ultimate speed for all particles. Unlike STR, this conclusion is not a 
postulate; it is a consequence of the fact that all particles are excitation waves of the 
quantum vacuum. 
Finally, there is an important point that one should not overlook. The fact that 
the maximum speeds for all particles (with or without rest mass) are the same 
strongly suggests that, the wave medium carrying the excitation waves of all particles 
(including massive particles and photons) must be the same (i.e., the same vacuum 
medium). In another word, all particles are different excitation waves of the same 
vacuum medium! 
12.4 Why is Mass Speed-Dependent? 
In classical mechanics, the mass of an object is considered to be an intrinsic mechan-
ical property of that object, and it is a constant. At the beginning of the twentieth 
century, a number of experiments had been conducted to measure the mass of an 
object at different speed [5–7]. It was found that the mass appears to increase with its 
speed. Later, many particle accelerators were built to study particle physics. It was 
fully veriﬁed that the mass of a particle is not a constant; instead, it increases with 
the speed in the following manner: 
m e
quals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period
√ 
m equals S t
artFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period
This phenomenon can be explained very easily using the quantum wave model. In 
fact, we have explicitly derived the above relation in Chap. 7 (see Eq. (7.21)). Using 
this wave model, it is not difﬁcult to explain why mass should increase with the 
speed of the particle. 
Recall that in our model, all sub-atomic particles are quantized excitation waves 
of the quantum vacuum. Hence, their limiting speed of propagation is determined by 
the physical properties of the vacuum medium, which is the speed of light c. Thus, 
no particle can travel faster than c. When the particle speed v is much smaller than 
c, one can easily apply force to accelerate the particle. The energy received by the 
particle is used mainly to increase the particle speed. But this situation will change 
when the particle speed approaches the speed of light, because it will become very 
difﬁcult to further increase the speed of the particle. That means, the particle cannot 
be accelerated as before using the same amount of force. It thus appears that the 
inertial mass of the particle increases dramatically at high speed. In another word, 
the input energy is no longer used fully to increase the speed of the particle, instead, 
it seems that part of the input energy is used to increase the particle mass.

12.4 Why is Mass Speed-Dependent?
167
Therefore, if one understands that particle is just a wave, one will expect that 
the particle cannot be accelerated in a linear manner. For a wave packet, the general 
relationship between p and v is not a straight line. In Chap. 7, we showed that the 
energy–momentum relation of a quantum particle is 
up er E squ ared

Recall that the velocity of the particle is the group velocity of the wave packet,

v e quals StartFraction partial differential omega Over partial differential k EndFraction equals StartFraction partial differential upper E Over partial differential p EndFraction period
v equals StartFraction partial differential omega Over partial differential k EndFraction equals StartFraction partial differential upper E Over partial differential p EndFraction period
Using these two relations, one can easily show that

Figure 12.1 is a plot of the momentum p versus the speed v for the Newtonian model 
and the wave model. 
In physics, the momentum p is deﬁned as the product of mass m and speed v, i.e., 
p equal
s m v period
Thus, the mass m is deﬁned as the slope of the line connecting the origin with the 
p versus v curve. From Fig. 12.1, it is apparent that this slope can vary with v. In  
the quantum wave model, the p vs  v curve appears as a straight line only when v

The Quantum Origin of the So-Called “Relativistic Relations”
is much smaller than c. When the speed of the particle is increased to approach the 
speed of light, the p vs v curve quickly bends upward; this explains why the mass 
of a quantum particle increases rapidly when the speed of the particle increases to 
near c (see Fig. 12.1). In fact, from the above two Eqs. (12.5) and (12.6), one can 
explicitly obtain 
m e
quals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period
√ 
m equals S t
artFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period
Therefore, the mass of a particle under acceleration is not constant. This relation 
agrees exactly with the results of experiments (i.e., Eq. (12.3)). 
From the above discussion, it is clear that the particle view used in classical 
mechanics is not an accurate description of the dynamic process in the microscopic 
world. This is because at the sub-atomic level, a quantum particle is a wave packet 
instead of a point mass. Thus, its energy, momentum, and mass relationships are 
different from that of Newtonian mechanics. In the old days, people thought that the 
mass is an intrinsic physical entity of an object, thus, m should be a constant. But 
such an impression is just an illusion at low speed. 
12.5 The Physical Basis for the Speed-Dependence of Mass 
Was Not from STR 
In many physics textbooks, it is often claimed that the discovery of mass being speed-
dependent is attributed to Einstein [8–10]. For example, in the textbook Feynman’s 
Lectures on Physics (Vol 1, Chap. 15), it was explicitly stated: “For over 200 years 
the equations of motion enunciated by Newton were believed to describe nature 
correctly, and the ﬁrst time that an error in these laws was discovered, the way to 
correct it was also discovered. Both the error and its correction were discovered by 
Einstein in 1905. 
Newton’s Second Law, … was stated with the tacit assumption that m is a constant, 
but we now know that this is not true, and that the mass of a body increases with 
velocity. In Einstein’s corrected formula m has the value m e
quals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction
√
m equals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction , where the 
“rest mass” m0 represents the mass of a body that is not moving…” [9] 
Such teaching is aimed to promote Einstein as a genius; this practice is quite 
common nowadays. However, it is not clear whether such textbook statements were 
based on facts. A careful examination of the literature record would indicate other-
wise. First, it is not true that Einstein was the ﬁrst one to discover that mass is not a 
constant. The discovery of mass varying with speed had been known from theoret-
ical and experimental studies many years before Einstein published his ﬁrst relativity 
paper in 1905 (see below). Second, Einstein’s derivation of the speed-dependent mass 
relations did not give the right results [4]. The correct relation of speed-dependent

12.5 The Physical Basis for the Speed-Dependence of Mass Was Not from STR
169
mass was not discovered by Einstein. In the followings, let us examine the historical 
records in detail. 
At the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists were interested in studying 
the electrodynamics and kinematics of an electron in the electromagnetic ﬁeld. They 
found that the electromagnetic contents of a charged particle could be related with 
its “inertial mass”. In 1899, Lorentz applied his modiﬁed aether theory to show 
that, the mass of a charged particle is not constant. Instead, the mass appears to 
be dependent on the speed of the particle, and, such speed-dependence is different 
between the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction [11]. Later in 1904, 
Lorentz explicitly showed that, the mass of an electron parallel to the direction of 
motion is m  S ub script Sub Subscript upper L Baseline equals gamma cubed m 0 and the mass perpendicular to the direction of motion is 
m S ubscript Sub Subscript upper T Baseline equals gamma m 0, where ga mma equals 1 divided by StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot
√ 
ga mma equals 1 divided by StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot is called the “Lorentz factor” [12]. 
In 1902, Max Abraham also published a paper entitled “PrinciplesoftheDynamics 
of the Electron”, in which he showed that the “transverse electromagnetic mass” of 
an electron is also dependent on the speed of the particle [13]. Although his formula 
was slightly different from Lorentz’s results, it also showed that the ratio of m Subscript Sub Subscript upper T Baseline divided by m 0
is a function of v squared divided by c squared. 
At about the same time, several experimental physicists tried to test the theories of 
Lorentz and Abraham by measuring the variation of mass as a function of speed. In 
1901 and 1902, Kaufmann published two papers on this topic [5, 6]. He demonstrated 
in experiment that the mass of a particle is indeed speed-dependent. In Kaufmann’s 
experiment, the mass to velocity relation was obtained by measuring the deﬂection 
of high-speed electrons emitted from a radioactive isotope (radium) in an electric and 
magnetic ﬁeld. The momentum of the electron was determined from the magnetic 
deﬂection, and its kinetic energy was determined by the electric deﬂection. Thus, both 
the velocity v and the e/m ratio can be determined for the electron in his experiment. 
(His experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 12.2).
The results of Kaufmann’s experiments clearly demonstrated that when the 
velocity of the electron increases toward the speed of light, its mass increases rapidly 
(see Fig. 12.3). Several years later, more experiments on the speed-dependence of 
mass were conducted by Bucherer, as well as Guye and Lavanchy [7, 14]. Their 
results are also plotted on Fig. 12.3. Taking these results together, it appears that all 
of their data could ﬁt with the so-called “Lorentz relation”: 
m e
quals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction
√ 
m equals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction
which is identical to the mass versus speed equation derived in the quantum wave 
model, i.e., Eq. (12.7). 
Following the works of Lorentz and Kaufmann, Einstein was aware that the mass 
of an object could vary with speed. He tried to derive such a relation in his 1905 paper 
on relativity [4]. Like Lorentz, Einstein thought that the mass of an object could be 
sub-classiﬁed into “longitudinal mass” and “transverse mass”; and they are speed-
dependent. From his calculation, Einstein showed that the mass of an “electron” can 
change with its traveling speed, such that

These predictions were later shown to be incorrect; they did not agree with the 
experimental data shown in Fig. 12.3. Many experiments had been conducted since 
the beginning of the twentieth century to measure particle mass at different speeds [5– 
7, 14]. These experimental results generally supported the prediction of Eq. (12.7), 
but not the results of Einstein’s 1905 paper (see Fig. 12.3). 
In conclusion, the experimental ﬁndings are entirely consistent with the 
quantum wave model but not with STR. From the wave perspective of our model, 
it is not difﬁcult to understand the physical foundation behind the speed-dependence 
of mass. This is because the quantum particle is a quantized excitation wave; its 
traveling speed cannot exceed the phase velocity of the vacuum medium, which is c. 
When the speed of the particle approaches the speed of light, it will become harder 
and harder to be accelerated; thus, the mass will appear to be heavier and heavier. 
12.6 Newtonian Mechanics is a Limiting Case of Wave 
Mechanics for a Quantum Particle 
In the traditional physics teaching, it is often said that the deviation from Newtonian 
mechanics at high speed is due to relativity. Now we have a new understanding. 
According to the quantum wave model, the reason for the particle behaving differently 
from Newtonian mechanics is because the quantum object is an excitation wave in 
nature; it looks like a particle in the macroscopic view. This wave packet will behave 
like a Newtonian particle only at certain physical limit, namely, when the longitudinal 
wave vector is much smaller than the transverse wave vector, i.e., k le ss than less than script l. 
12.6.1 
The Speed of the Quantum Particle Depends 
on the Ratio of k and script l
From the dispersion relation of the quantum wave function representing a massive 
particle, one can directly calculate the particle’s traveling speed, which is the group 
velocity of the wave packet, 
v equals StartFraction partial differential omega Over partial differential k EndFraction equals StartFraction c k Over StartRoot k squared plus script l squared EndRoot EndFraction period

v  equals StartFraction c k Over StartRoot k squared plus script l squared EndRoot EndFraction almost equals c StartFraction k Over script l EndFraction less than less than c period
Thus, the speed of the particle is far smaller than the speed of light when the 
longitudinal wave vector is much smaller than the transverse wave vector. 
On the other hand, in the opposite case that k gr eater than greater than script l, the speed of the particle can 
approach (but not exceed) the speed of light, 
v e
quals StartFraction c k Over StartRoot k squared plus script l squared EndRoot EndFraction less than or equals c period
√

Recall that k is related to the particle’s momentum p and script l is related to the particle’s 
rest mass mo, the above relation implies that: (1) The speed of a particle with no 
rest mass (script l = 0) must always travel at the speed of light. (2) The particle’s speed 
will approach the speed of light when the longitudinal wave vector is much larger 
than the transverse wave vector, (i.e., when the kinetic energy contributed by the 
momentum is much larger than the resting energy contributed from the rest mass). 
One may notice that this conclusion is independent of the absolute value of script l (i.e., the 
rest mass of the particle). This explains why all particles must have the same speed 
limit c regardless of their rest mass. It is a consequence of the fact that all particles 
are excitation waves of the same vacuum medium, and the physical properties of the 
vacuum determine the ultimate speed of wave transmission.

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is identiﬁed as the “resting energy”, which is a 
constant for a given particle. The second term on the right-hand side is the kinetic 
energy of the particle as given in Newtonian mechanics. Thus, from Eq. (12.12), one 
can clearly see that, the dispersion relation of the quantum particle can be reduced 
into the energy–momentum relation of Newtonian mechanics when k le ss than less than script l. Further-
more, it also gives the kinetic energy formula as used in the Newtonian mechanical 
theory (see Eq. (12.13)). 
One may wonder what is the physical meaning of the condition k le ss than less than script l. As we  
showed earlier, k is related to the momentum p of the quantum particle. This is just 
the de Broglie relation. In Chap. 11, we also showed that script l is related to the rest mass 
of the particle. From an energy perspective, the condition k le ss than less than script l would mean that 
the kinetic energy is much smaller than the resting energy of the particle. 
12.7 Modiﬁcation of Newton’s Gravitation Law Based 
on Our New Understanding of Mass in the Wave View 
As we know, the gravitational theory in classical mechanics was developed by 
Newton (see Fig. 12.4), a giant ﬁgure in physics. The original formula proposed 
by the Newtonian gravitational theory had an ambiguity; it is not clear whether the 
“mass” deﬁned in that equation represents the rest mass or the moving mass of an 
object. In the day of Newton, people did not know that mass can change with speed. 
So they thought there is only one type of mass, and which is a constant. With our 
knowledge today, we know the understanding of Newton’s time is not correct.
Now, we must decide whether the mass term in the Newtonian gravitational law 
represents the moving mass or the rest mass. The answer is not that difﬁcult to ﬁnd. In 
the Newtonian mechanics, the mass is deﬁned from the momentum. So the mass there 
is called “inertial mass”, which is equivalent to the “moving mass” we understand 
today. In the Newtonian theory, the gravitational mass should be identical to the 
inertial mass. Thus, the gravitational mass included in Newton’s gravitational law

on Newton’s gravitational theory and Newton’s laws. Furthermore, he had contributed to a wide 
range of topics including optics and calculus. Photo credit: Portrait of Isaac Newton (1642–1727)

must be equal to the moving mass instead of the rest mass of that object. This means 
that in the Newtonian gravitational law, we should identify the two masses involved 
(M and M’) as the  moving masses. In another word, we can generalize Newton’s 
gravitational law by identifying

movement of the two interacting objects. In another word, the generalized Newton’s

future experiments. One can carefully analyze the movement of objects around a star 
or movements of stars in a galaxy. One may ﬁnd that the movement could deviate 
slightly from the calculation based on the original Newton’s law. Such deviations 
can be tested against the predictions of the revised Newton’s law as described in 
Eq. (12.14).

12.8 Gravity Can Be Understood as a Consequence 
of Energy-Attracting-Energy 
Now, since the moving mass is not a constant of the object, it does not enjoy a 
special role as an inherent property of that object. In Newton’s gravitational law, the 
gravitational force between two objects is supposed to be generated by their masses. 
If mass is no longer regarded as an intrinsic property of the particle in the wave view, 
could one ﬁnd a deeper reason for the generation of the gravitational force? 
A possible answer could be that: Newton’s gravitational law can be rewritten 
based on the energy of the object rather than the mass of the object. Since the mass 
m is proportional to the energy of a particle E by the relation E = mc2, we can express 
Newton’s gravitational law as 
upper F equals upper G StartFraction m 1 m 2 Over r squared EndFraction equals StartFraction upper G Over c Superscript 4 Baseline EndFraction StartFraction upper E 1 upper E 2 Over r squared EndFraction equals upper G prime StartFraction upper E 1 upper E 2 Over r squared EndFraction comma

where G’ = G/c4. In another word, we can interpret the source of the gravitational 
force as energy-attracting-energy instead of mass-attracting-mass! 
This energy here is the total energy of the object, which includes both the resting 
energy uper E 0 and the kinetic energy cp. Thus, for particles that have no resting energy, 
they can still be attracted in a gravitation ﬁeld. This explains why light can be bent 
when it passes through the vicinity of a massive object. It has been observed in astro-
nomical studies that when light passes through a galaxy, it can generate a “lensing 
effect” [15–17]. This is a convincing demonstration that the massless photon can 
interact with a gravitational ﬁeld. 
12.8.1 
Speed of Gravitational Wave Equal c Implies 
that Gravitational Force Is Transmitted Through 
the Vacuum Medium 
Another major question about gravity is: what is the medium that transmits the 
gravitational force? In our model, the vacuum is ﬁlled with only one type of medium, 
that is, the quantum vacuum. Therefore, the simplest physical assumption is that, 
like the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force is also transmitted through the 
same quantum vacuum. In fact, there is an important piece of evidence for supporting 
this assumption. According to the current understanding, the gravitational force is 
transmitted at a speed equal of c (the speed of light) [18]. Therefore, it is highly 
possible that the gravitational force is transmitted through the same medium as the 
transmission of light. This may further suggest that the mechanism of the gravitational 
transmission could also be based on a similar mechanism related to the excitation of 
the quantum vacuum.

The Quantum Origin of the So-Called “Relativistic Relations”
12.9 Chapter Summary 
• There is a serious conﬂict between quantum mechanics and relativity. In relativity, 
the vacuum must be empty; otherwise, it will provide a reference frame to deter-
mine which inertial frame is stationary and which one is not. Quantum mechanics, 
on the other hand, regards the vacuum as the ground state of the quantum system, 
which cannot be empty. 
• Why is the speed of light constant? This is because the photon is a quantized 
excitation wave of the vacuum, its traveling speed is determined by the physical 
properties of the wave medium. From the Maxwell’s theory, the velocity of light 
in the vacuum is c equ
als 1 divided by StartRoot mu 0 epsilon 0 EndRoot√c e quals 1 divided by StartRoot mu 0 epsilon 0 EndRoot , which is a constant regardless of the chosen 
coordinates. 
• Why can no particle travel faster than light? This is because all particles are 
excitation waves of the vacuum; their traveling speed v is determined by the 
group velocity of its wave packet. According to the dispersion relation obtained 
in the quantum wave model, the group velocity of a massless particle (photon) is 
c, while the group velocity of a massive particle cannot exceed c. 
• Why is the mass of a particle speed-dependent? This is because the quantum 
particle is a wave, its traveling speed cannot exceed the speed of light c. Suppose 
the particle is accelerated using a ﬁxed amount of force. When the particle speed 
v is much smaller than c, one can easily accelerate the particle. This situation 
changes when the particle speed v approaches the speed of light, it will be very 
difﬁcult to further increase v. It thus appears that the inertial mass of the particle 
increases dramatically at high speed. 
• Since the gravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass, which is speed-
dependent, the Newton’s gravitational law needs to be revised to accommodate 
this new ﬁnding. We propose that the gravitational force will depend not only on 
the rest masses of the interacting objects and the distance between them, but it 
will also depend on the speeds of movement of the two interacting objects. 
• Conceptually, gravity can now be understood as a force of energy-attracting-
energy, instead of mass-attracting-mass. Finally, the recently reported ﬁnding 
that the speed of gravitational wave equals to c suggests that the gravitational 
force, like the electromagnetic force, is transmitted through the vacuum medium 
(i.e., the quantum vacuum).

The Physical Basis of Lorentz 
Transformation and Minkowski’s 
Four-Dimensional Space–Time 
In the special theory of relativity (STR), the coordinates in a stationary inertial 
frame and the coordinates in a moving frame can be converted between each other 
using the Lorentz transformation. Thus, many people thought the applicability of 
Lorentz transformation is a veriﬁcation of STR. Such thinking is not true. The Lorentz 
transformation was ﬁrst proposed by Hendrik Lorentz at the end of the nineteenth 
century based on his aether theory; it was developed to explain the ﬁnding of the 
Michelson-Morley experiment that the propagation of light is unchanged in different 
moving frames [1–3]. Later, Einstein showed in 1905 that one could greatly simplify 
the derivation of the Lorentz transformation using STR [4]. However, his derivation 
was not unique. In many models, Lorentz transformation can be derived based on 
the requirement that the equation of motion of light does not change between two 
different inertial frames. 
Therefore, the derivation of the Lorentz transformation does not require the 
assumption of an empty vacuum. There is a clear difference between Lorentz invari-
ance and the principle of relativity. In the case of Lorentz invariance, it only requires 
that a transformation of coordinate from (t, x, y, z) into (t’, x’, y’, z’) would not 
change the mathematical form of the equation of motion. It is purely a mathematical 
concept; it does not prove whether the universe has a ﬁxed resting frame or not. The 
principle of relativity is far more stringent; it assumes that there is no ﬁxed resting 
frame in our universe. Thus, the vacuum must be an empty space. In such a case, any 
inertial frame can be chosen as a stationary frame. 
In the quantum wave model discussed in this book, the vacuum of course is not 
empty. In fact, we hypothesize that the quantum vacuum is a dielectric medium. In 
this chapter, we will show that, with this non-empty vacuum, one can easily derive 
the Lorentz transformation.

13.1 
The Measurements of Space and Time in a Wave 
Propagating System 
13.1.1 
How to Deﬁne Space and Time? The Particle View vs 
the Wave View  
Our physical world can be described as four-dimensional, i.e., three dimensions in 
space and one dimension in time. For an inertial system, how can one deﬁne the 
length in time or space? Apparently, one needs some sort of measuring ruler (i.e., a 
reference system) to do that. Then, what sort of reference system can one use? 
In the classical mechanical system, the basic building blocks of the material world 
are particles, which can move freely in an empty space following certain mechanical 
laws, such as Newton’s Laws. There is no natural reference system for measuring the 
length of space and time. The situation is different in a wave system. For example, 
in the view of the quantum wave model discussed in this book, our Universe is ﬁlled 
with a vacuum medium; the “particles” are excitation waves of the vacuum. In this 
case, there is a natural reference system to measure the time and space. For instance, 
one can use the propagation of light (photon) to deﬁne the length of time and space. 
More speciﬁcally, time can be determined from the frequency of a speciﬁc type of 
light, while the space can be measured using the wavelength of this light. 
In this case, one can easily see that space and time could appear as relative in a 
wave propagating system. We know from the Doppler effect that the frequency of a 
wave can shift in a moving frame in comparison to a stationary frame. Hence, if one 
uses a wave system as the reference for an inertial system, it is not surprising that 
one will ﬁnd the time and space are not absolute; they can vary depending on the 
motional state (speed) of the inertial system.

Graphical Analysis of the Changes of Space and Time 
Between a Stationary Frame and a Moving Frame. 
The Physical Basis of Time Dilation and Lorentz 
Contraction from the Wave View 
Why can time and space vary in different inertial frames? It is basically like an 
“optical Doppler effect”. Let us use a concrete example to demonstrate this point. 
Suppose S is an inertial frame which is stationary relative to the vacuum; S’ is an  
inertial frame that moves at a speed v relative to the stationary frame S (see Fig. 13.1).
In the stationary frame S, light wave is propagating in the way shown in the 
Fig. 13.2. For simplicity, we assume light wave is a plane wave. This light wave has 
regular frequency and wavelength. Suppose there is a clock attached to the inertial 
frame S, how can one measure the time in the S frame using the wave system? One

13.1 The Measurements of Space and Time in a Wave Propagating System
181
Fig. 13.1 A stationary frame S and a moving frame S’ with a speed v
can count the number of oscillations within a ﬁxed time period (normal upper Delta tau); suppose this 
number is n. Then, one can deﬁne one unit of time (normal upper Delta t) in the  S frame as the time 
period that contains n number of oscillations of the wave, i.e.,
normal upper  Delta t eq uals a tim e period for observing n oscillations period
Now, for an observer located in the moving frame S’, he will also observe that the 
light wave is propagating as a series of plane waves. But because S’ is moving, these 
plane waves become slightly compressed (See Fig. 13.2). That means the observed 
frequency of light wave in the S’ frame is higher than that of the S frame. Suppose a 
clock identical to the clock in S frame is attached to the S’ frame, one can measure 
the time in the S’ frame by counting the number of oscillations of the light wave 
within the ﬁxed time period normal upper Delta tau. Suppose this number is n’. Then, the unit of time 
in the S’ frame  (normal upper Delta t prime) is determined to be
nor mal upper  Delta t Su perscript pr ime Baseline equals a time period for observing n prime oscillations period

dilation in the moving 
frame S’ compared to the 
stationary frame S. 
Suppose an identical plane 
wave light is propagating in 
the S frame and S’ frame. 
The frequency of light waves 
observed in the S frame and 
S’ frame would appear to be 
different. This could be 
interpreted as that the clocks 
in the S and S’ frames may 
run at different rates

Fig. 13.3 The length 
contraction in the moving 
frame S’ in comparing to 
the stationary frame S. The 
wavelength is denoted λ in S 
frame and λ’ in  S’ frame. As 
indicated by the blue arrows 
in the ﬁgure, one can see that 
λ > λ’. This could explain 
the Lorentz contraction for 
the moving frame 
Since the observed oscillation frequency in the S’ frame is higher than that in the 
S frame, the number of oscillations within the ﬁxed time period (normal upper Delta tau) observed in 
the S’ frame (n’) is larger than the number of oscillations observed in the S frame 
(n), i.e., n prime greater than n. Thus, based on the above analysis, it would appear that nor m al upper Delta t Superscript prime Baseline greater than normal upper Delta t. 
This explains why one may observe a “time dilation” in the moving frame. 
Similarly, if one compares the wave oscillation in the spatial domain between the S 
frame and the S’ frame, one should also ﬁnd that the wave oscillation in the moving S’ 
frame is compressed in comparison to the wave oscillation observed in the stationary 
S frame (see Fig. 13.3). Suppose the light wave is propagating along the z-direction, 
along which the S’ frame is moving away from the S frame. The length of space (in 
the z-direction) in each inertial frame can be determined from the wavelength of the 
oscillation wave (lamda). Due to the compressing of the oscillation wave in the moving 
frame, one will ﬁnd that the wavelength in the S’ frame is shorter than the wavelength 
in the S frame. This explains why the length of space appears to be contracted in a 
moving inertial frame; this observation is called “Lorentz contraction”.

This requirement that the wave equation must appear the same in the S1 frame as in 
the S2 frame is called “Lorentz invariant”. (Note: In the literature, this is sometimes 
called “Lorentz covariant”.) The transformation of left parenthesis bold italic x 1 comma t 1 right parenthesis right arrow left parenthesis bold italic x 2 comma t 2 right parenthesisis called the 
“Lorentz transformation”. 
Without saying, since the transformation of the wave equation from S1 frame 
to S2 frame is Lorentz invariant, the solution of this wave equation is also Lorentz 
invariant. That means when the wave function is transformed from the S1 frame to 
S2 frame, the wave function would look exactly the same in form.

trajectory of the photon. We know light is a propagating wave. In order to follow the

easy to see that, in the S1 frame, the peaks of psi  1 tilde e Superscript i left parenthesis z 1 minus c t 1 right parenthesisis moving in a way that

Derivation of the Lorentz Transformation 
in the Quantum Wave Model 
In order to meet the requirement of invariance of light propagation in different inertial 
frames, one must transform both the spatial coordinate z and the time dimension t 
during the “Lorentz transformation”. Since S2 frame is moving with velocity v in the 
z-axis relative to S1 frame, their spatial coordinates in the transverse direction (i.e., 
x and y axes) do not need to change, i.e.,

In summary, the Lorentz transformation between the coordinates in the S1 frame 
and S2 frame is given in the Table 13.1. 
From the above discussions, one can see that the Lorentz transformation is really 
based on the requirement of invariance of the propagation of light in different inertial 
frames. Such a requirement is reﬂected in the results of the optical interferometer 
experiments and the Maxwell theory of light wave propagation. The derivation of 
the Lorentz transformation does not require the vacuum to be empty. 
13.3.1 
How Does the Quantum Wave Model Differ from STR 
on Lorentz Transformation? 
From the above analysis, one can see that the Lorentz transformation can be easily 
derived based on the quantum wave model. There is a major difference between 
the results shown above and the results of STR. In the case of STR, it excludes the 
aether model and regards the vacuum as an empty space. Hence, any frame could be 
regarded as a stationary frame. 
In the quantum wave model, the argument is different. We showed that, in order 
to explain the optical Doppler effect, a two-dimensional coordinate transformation is 
required. From the requirement of invariance for light propagation in different frames, 
one can derive the Lorentz transformation. Thus, the coordinate transformation does 
not imply the absence of a wave medium. In our derivation of Lorentz transformation, 
it never requires the light wave to propagate in an empty space. (In fact, if the 
vacuum is empty, it will be impossible to support the propagation of the light wave.) 
The Lorentz transformation is between any two arbitrary inertial frames; it does not 
require one of these frames to be the stationary frame.

13.4 The Four-Dimensional Space–Time as Proposed by Minkowski
187
In Einstein’s original paper published in 1905, he stated that his theory of relativity 
is based on two postulates [4]: 
(1) The same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of 
reference. 
(2) Light is always propagated in empty space with a deﬁnite velocity c which is 
independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. 
Later, as the theory of relativity became more popular, the ﬁrst postulate was 
greatly expanded to cover all physical laws. Thus, in the modern-day version of the 
STR, it is claimed to be built on two postulates [6, 7]: 
(1) All inertial frames are equivalent with respect to the laws of physics. 
(2) The speed of light in empty space always has the same value c. 
As we had shown in the above, it is not necessary to have these postulates for 
deriving the Lorentz transformation. 
First, Postulate 1 is an unsubstantiated over-claim. What one needs to show 
is that the propagation of light appears to be the same in different inertial frames. 
This can be accomplished based on the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment. 
Certainly, the optical interferometer results only implied that light propagation is 
independent of the inertial frame, they did not imply that all laws of physics are the 
same in all inertial frame. 
Second, Postulate 1 cannot be true if the vacuum is a wave medium. In this case, 
one can determine which frame is stationary. 
Finally, Postulate 2 is unnecessary. It does not need to have the status of a 
“postulate”, since it is a direct result of the Maxwell theory of light and the Michelson-
Morley experiment. We know c equals StartRoot 1 divided by epsilon 0 mu 0 EndRoot√c equals StartRoot 1 divided by epsilon 0 mu 0 EndRoot, which is determined by the physical 
properties of the vacuum. Thus, it is obvious that the speed of light should not change 
in different inertial frames. 
13.4 
The Four-Dimensional Space–Time as Proposed 
by Minkowski 
One attractive feature of STR is the concept of four-dimensional space–time. This 
concept is made famous by Minkowski’s proposal of treating space–time in a four-
vector framework. His proposal of using the matrix tensor to connect the covariant 
four vector with the contravariant four vector is now a standard treatment in particle 
physics. 
The beautiful mathematical framework proposed by Minkowski has helped 
tremendously for the acceptance of STR in general public. But in reality, is our 
world a truly four-dimensional world? Actually, there is room for debate. As we will 
show in Appendix F, if one uses the Hilbert space (which appears more natural in 
comparing to human perception) to describe a multi-dimensional world, time is not 
exactly a real dimension, like what we experience in the axis of a rectangular system.

188
13
The Physical Basis of Lorentz Transformation and Minkowski’s …
It may be more appropriate to call time as a “pseudo-dimension”. If one chooses to 
use the mathematical framework of Minkowski, then, the wave equation of light 
propagation may look like a four-dimensional world of space–time. (For details, see 
Appendix F.) 
The Lorentz transformation is the basis for the establishment of Minkowski’s four-
dimensional space–time framework. But in reality, the proposal of regarding time 
as the 4th dimension was ﬁrst made by Poincare in around 1906 [8]. A short history 
on the development of the four-dimensional space–time concept is summarized in 
Appendix F. 
13.4.1 
Mathematical Physics and Reality 
In the development of a physical theory, it usually involves two parts: (1) the physical 
concept and (2) the mathematical framework. A good mathematical framework can 
help to make the physical theory look simple or beautiful. Usually, in the eye of the 
readers, people tend to accept more easily a theory if it can be expressed in a very 
compact form in mathematics, or, if the mathematical presentation looks beautiful, 
e.g., the notation or equation is highly symmetrical. That is why sometimes a certain 
mathematical physics work can become very popular although its physical concept 
might be highly questionable. 
One way to make a physical concept look simple is to use a matrix to describe the 
physical entities in different dimensions of space–time. In this regard, Minkowski 
(and later Einstein) had done a very successful job. 
Of course, physics is for the understanding of nature, it is more than a beautiful 
theory of mathematical physics. To evaluate the validity of an important physical 
theory, one must carefully test its postulates in experiment. There is no exception for 
STR. So, in order to test the validity of STR, one must design some critical experi-
ments. Recently, we have proposed such an experiment based on a precise measure-
ment of the moving mass of a particle [9]. This experiment will be summarized in 
the next chapter. 
13.5 
Chapter Summary 
• In the quantum wave model discussed in this book, our Universe is ﬁlled with a 
vacuum medium; the particles are excitation waves of the vacuum. In this case, 
there is a natural reference system to measure time and space. For instance, one 
can use the propagation of light (photon) to deﬁne the length of time and space. 
More speciﬁcally, time can be determined from the frequency of a speciﬁc type 
of light, while space can be measured using the wavelength of this light.

• Then, both space and time could appear as being relative. We know from the 
Doppler effect that the frequency of a wave can shift in a moving frame in compar-
ison to a stationary frame. Hence, if one uses a wave system as the reference for 
an inertial system, it is not surprising that one will ﬁnd the time and space are 
not absolute; they can vary depending on the motional state (speed) of the inertial 
system. 
• Based on the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, we know light prop-
agation is independent of the inertial frame. That means the wave equation of 
light in the vacuum should be unchanged between two inertial frames moving at 
different speeds. This requirement that the wave equation must appear the same 
in the S1 frame as in the S2 frame is called “Lorentz invariant”. 
• The Lorentz transformation can be easily derived based on the quantum wave 
model. Unlike the derivation in STR, which regards the vacuum as an empty 
space, and hence any frame could be regarded as a stationary frame, the quantum 
wave model uses a different argument. We showed that, in order to explain the 
optical Doppler effect, a two-dimensional coordinate transformation is required. 
From the requirement of invariance for light propagation in different frames, one 
can easily derive the Lorentz transformation. Thus, the coordinate transformation 
does not imply the absence of a wave medium.

Experimental Tests on the Principle 
of Relativity and the Twin Paradox 
Both quantum mechanics and relativity are important theories in modern physics. 
However, there is a serious conﬂict between them, namely, their views on the vacuum 
are totally different. In quantum mechanics, the vacuum is not regarded as an empty 
space; the vacuum is just the ground state of the quantum system, which is thought 
to have very rich physical properties. The special theory of relativity (STR), on the 
other hand, requires that the vacuum must be an empty space, otherwise, the vacuum 
would become an absolute resting frame in our universe. Using such a reference 
frame, one can easily determine which inertial frame is at rest and which one is 
moving. This would defeat the Principle of Relativity. 
Physicists today are thus facing with a dilemma: which view of the vacuum should 
one believe? In science, all important questions must be settled in experiment. There-
fore, there is a strong need for us to design new experiments to test whether there is 
an absolute resting frame in our universe or not. 
In this chapter, we will discuss two new experiments for testing the Principle of 
Relativity. The ﬁrst experiment is to test whether the speed-dependence of moving 
mass is the same in different inertial frame. The second experiment is to test the 
famous Twin Paradox using extra-terrestrial clocks. 
14.1 Experimental Test #1: Is There a Universal Resting 
Frame in Our World? Measuring the Particle’s Mass 
in Different Moving Frames 
A simple experiment to test whether there is a resting frame in our universe or not 
would be to measure the moving mass of a particle in an inertial frame oriented in 
different direction in reference to the solar system. Detailed design of this proposed 
experiment had been reported in our earlier paper [1].

where M is the moving mass and m 0 is the rest mass. When the speed of the particle 
increases, the moving mass of the particle will also increase. Using such a principle, 
it is possible to determine if a laboratory frame is in motion relative to the resting 
frame of our universe. 
The basic experimental setup is shown in Fig. 14.1. For simplicity, the charged 
particles used for this measurement could be electrons. Using an accelerator, the 
electrons are accelerated to a speed u. The speed of the outgoing electrons can be 
measured using a Time-of-Flight device. Using a switching magnet, the electron 
beams can be directed either to a spectrometer at the right or a spectrometer at the 
left. The masses determined in these two spectrometers (MR and ML, respectively) 
are then compared. 
This experiment will be repeated at different time of the day, and in different 
days of the year. We will examine if any non-zero reading for nor ma l u pper Delta upper M equals upper M Subscript upper R Baseline minus upper M Subscript upper L
can be detected, and whether the measured normal upper Delta upper M will vary with the orientation of the 
laboratory frame. 
If the STR is correct, all inertial frames will be equivalent. Then, the laboratory 
frame can be regarded as the stationary frame. The moving mass should be the same 
regardless of the particle’s moving direction. But if the vacuum is a dielectric medium 
as proposed in the quantum wave model, there is a resting frame in our universe. One 
will observe a difference in the moving mass when the particle changes its traveling 
direction. This is because the speed of the particle is a vector sum of the particle’s

difference between particles going to the left or going to the right. The measured moving mass of 
the two particles will be the same. Credit: This ﬁgure is reproduced from an earlier publication of

Fig. 14.2 The basic idea of 
our proposed experiment. 
If the vacuum is a universal 
resting frame, the particle 
traveling to the right should 
have a combined speed faster 
than the particle traveling to 
the left. The measured 
moving mass of the two 
particles will be different 
velocity relative to the laboratory frame and the velocity of the laboratory frame 
relative to the vacuum (see Fig. 14.2). 
We proposed to conduct this experiment in a way similar to the Michelson-Morley 
experiment. Since the experimental apparatus is ﬁxed at the surface of the Earth, 
its orientation depends on the Earth’s rotation. Thus, the direction of the particle 
movement will change at different times of the day or in different seasons of the 
year (see Fig. 14.3). This means that the observed difference in the moving mass will 
change with the hours of the day.
The speed of the Earth can be estimated from the Earth’s orbital speed, the speed 
of the Sun in our galaxy, and the speed of the Milky Way vs the rest of the universe. 
We estimated that the mass variation due to the change of apparatus orientation can be 
as high as StartFraction normal upper Delta m Over m 0 EndFraction almost equals 2 times 10 Superscript negative 4
Sta rtFr a ction normal upper Delta m Over m 0 EndFraction almost equals 2 times 10 Superscript negative 4 [1]. Such a change of particle mass should be measurable 
using existing technology.

on a precise measurement of particle mass”, Eur. Phys. J. Plus  132, 140 (2017)). 
14.2 Experimental Test #2: Can Any Inertial Frame Be 
Regarded as the Stationary Frame? 
A second set of experiments to test the Principle of Relativity can be based on the 
“Twin Paradox”. In the special theory of relativity (STR), it is hypothesized that all 
inertial frames are equal (the so-called “principle of relativity”); thus, any inertial 
frame can be regarded as the stationary frame [2, 3]. There was a famous challenge 
to this hypothesis; it was called the “Twin Paradox” (or  “Clock Paradox”) [3–7].

14.2.1 
The Twin Paradox: A Challenge to the Principle 
of Relativity 
One of the most peculiar results of STR is its prediction of time dilation. More  
speciﬁcally, based on the Lorentz transformation, it was predicted that time would 
become slower in a moving frame in comparison to the stationary frame. The elapse 
times between two events measured in the stationary frame and the moving frame 
are related by
nor mal  up p
er Delta t Superscript prime Baseline equals gamma normal upper Delta t equals StartFraction normal upper Delta t Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction comma
√ 
no rmal up e
r Delta t Superscript prime Baseline equals gamma normal upper Delta t equals StartFraction normal upper Delta t Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction comma
where v is the speed of the moving frame and c is the speed of light, the factor γ is 
called “the Lorentz factor” which is always larger than 1. This relation implies that 
the time interval measured in a given clock is less in the rest frame of the clock than 
in any other frame. Thus, it would appear that “the moving clocks run slow” [3, 7]. 
This prediction of STR raised a serious challenge [7]. It was argued that, if two 
identical twin brothers (A and B) travel in different ways, they will have conﬂicting 
age expectations. Suppose twin brother A stays on the Earth while twin B travels in

14.2 Experimental Test #2: Can Any Inertial Frame Be Regarded …

a rocket moving away in space. After sometime, B returns to the Earth. A thinks B 
is the moving twin. Due to the time dilation predicted by STR, B should be younger 
than A (see Fig. 14.4). But according to the principle of relativity, B could think he is 
the stationary one and regard A as the moving twin, so A should be younger than B. 
These two conclusions are contradicting. Thus, there is a paradox. (This is generally 
referred to as the “Twin Paradox” or “Clock Paradox”). 
Many physicists had dismissed this paradox by pointing out that, it is easy to 
determine who the moving brother is, because the twin in the rocket would experience 
acceleration and deceleration, but the twin staying on Earth would not [3, 7]. Thus, 
there is no paradox. 
The above argument, however, cannot entirely dismiss the paradox. What happens 
if we modify the arrangement of traveling for the two twin brothers? Suppose both 
the twin brother A and twin brother B ride on rockets to travel in opposite directions. 
After a certain time period, both of them return to Earth (see Fig. 14.5). In this 
case, both of them would experience the same acceleration and deceleration. Their 
experiences are symmetrical, so each one can claim that the other brother is moving 
relative to himself.
Alternatively, what happens if the twin brothers are placed on different planets 
of the solar system? In this case, they are clearly staying in different inertial frames, 
and none of them would experience acceleration and deceleration. Then, which one 
of the twin brothers will age slower? 
In order to clearly test the principle of relativity, we propose to conduct an exper-
iment to examine the Twin Paradox using extra-terrestrial clocks. For example, we 
can compare the time readings between two sets of atomic clocks placed separately 
in Mars and Earth. The detailed experimental design will be discussed in the later 
part of this chapter.
Fig. 14.4 An illustration showing the basic arrangement of the twin paradox. Suppose twin 
brother A stays on the Earth while twin brother B travels in a rocket moving away in space. After 
sometime, B returns to the Earth. A thinks B is the moving twin. Due to the time dilation predicted 
by STR, twin B should be younger than twin A. However, according to the principle of relativity, B 
can regard A as the moving twin. Then, twin A should be younger than twin B. There is a paradox

Re-Examining the Previous Experiments on the Twin 
Paradox: Did They Ask the Key Questions? 
Previously, a number of experiments had claimed to test the Twin Paradox [5, 8]. 
However, most of them were designed to test time dilation instead of the principle 
of relativity. To fully test the Twin Paradox, the experiment needs to answer two 
independent questions: 
(1) Will the moving twin be younger than the stationary twin? This is to test 
whether time is different in different reference frames and this difference agrees 
with the Lorentz transformation. 
(2) Caneithertwinberegardedasthestationarytwin? This is to test the principle 
of relativity: Could any inertial frame be taken as the stationary frame? Will it 
create a paradox? 
Most previous experiments were designed to test Question #1 but not Question 
#2. For example, a very well-known experiment claiming to test the Twin Paradox 
was an experiment conducted by Hafele and Keating [8, 9], in which a set of clocks 
was carried by commercial airlines around the Earth; then, times were compared 
between these traveling clocks and clocks located in the laboratory (see Fig. 14.6). 
More speciﬁcally, four atomic clocks were ﬂown around the world on commercial 
jet ﬂights during October 1971, once eastward and once westward. They observed 
directionally dependent time differences. Relative to the atomic clocks staying on 
ground, the ﬂying clocks lost 59 ns during the eastward trip and gained 273 ns 
during the westward trip. Their observed results appeared to be in good agreement 
with predictions of conventional relativity theory. Thus, they claimed that their results 
“provide an unambiguous empirical resolution of the famous clock ‘paradox’…” [8].
A careful examination of the Hafele-Keating experiment, however, raises a ques-
tion on whether they had truly tested the Twin Paradox. Their experiment only demon-
strated that the times between the laboratory clocks and the moving clocks were

different and were in agreement with the prediction of STR. Their experiment did 
not test whether any inertial frame can be regarded as the stationary frame. In fact, 
in their experiment, they could only use the virtual clock in the center of the Earth 
as the stationary frame to ﬁt their data. If they chose either the clock ﬂying Eastward 
or the clock ﬂying Westward as the stationary clock, the result would not ﬁt with the 
prediction of STR. 
This point could be easily overlooked because there was a technical bias in their 
experimental design; it is obvious that the clocks carried in airplanes could not be 
regarded as a stationary frame. Since the movement of an airplane involved accelera-
tion, taking off and landing, the airplane is not an inertial frame. So, one can naturally 
choose the virtual clock at the center of the Earth as the only inertial frame. The design 
of their experiment had excluded the possibility of testing the second question in the 
Twin Paradox, i.e., can either twin brothers be regarded as stationary? 
Similar limitations also existed in other experiments designed to test time dilation. 
For example, Bailey et al. measured the relativistic time dilation for positive and 
negative muons in a circular orbit within the CERN Muon Storage Ring [10]. Their 
results were found to be in accordance with the prediction of special relativity. In 
this experiment, the laboratory was taken as the stationary frame, while the stored 
muons were taken as the moving frame. So, such experiment could not test whether 
any inertial frame can be chosen as the stationary frame.

14.3 Testing the Twin Paradox Using Extra-Terrestrial 
Clocks 
Therefore, in order to truly test the Twin Paradox, we need to design a new experiment 
to address Question #2 speciﬁcally. That is, the clocks must be placed in two different 
inertial frames, where there is no acceleration and deceleration. The symmetrical 
arrangement would allow one to assume either one of these inertial frames as the 
stationary frame. One can then test whether there is a time dilation between these 
clocks as predicted by the STR. 
Since both the Earth and Mars are rotating around the Sun at almost constant 
speeds, each of them can be regarded as an independent inertial system in their own 
right. Furthermore, the moving speeds of the Earth and Mars are high enough and 
thus can easily generate a large time dilation effect which is not difﬁcult to measure. 
This is a very ideal situation to test the Twin Paradox (see Fig. 14.7). 
With the current technology, it is not difﬁcult to put an experimental clock on 
Mars and compare its time with a clock stationed on Earth. In the past two decades, 
several space agencies, including NASA, ESA, and CNSA, had already launched 
many exploratory probes to Mars. These probes include land rovers and orbiters. 
Many of them are known to carry highly precise clocks. Some of these clocks could 
be used as the Mars clock in this experiment.

system, the Earth moves at a higher speed than Mars. b If one regards the Earth as the Stationary 
frame, the Mars is a moving frame with a speed of (vMars − vEarth). c Alternatively, if one regards 
the Mars as the Stationary frame, the Earth is a moving frame with a speed of (vEarth − vMars)

14.3.1 
Key Models to be Tested 
The experimental results will be used to compare with the predictions of three 
different theoretical models: 
(1) The Galilean model, which represents the view of classical mechanics. Time 
is supposed to be the same in every inertial frame. 
(2) The special theory of relativity (STR), in which the Earth is assumed to be the 
stationary frame. 
(3) The special theory of relativity (STR), in which Mars is assumed to be the 
stationary frame. 
We propose to conduct this experiment by putting one clock on Mars and 
comparing its time with a laboratory clock staying on Earth. We can then use the 
measured time dilation data to test the three models discussed above. 
Based on the Lorentz factors, one can calculate the theoretical values of time 
dilation between the Mars clock and the Earth clock according to different theoretical 
models. We know the moving speed of Earth around the Sun (v Subscript upper E) is 29.78 km/s; 
the moving speed of Mars (v Subscript upper M) around the Sun is 24.07 km/s; the rotation speed 
at the surface of Earth (v Subscript upper R upper E) is 465 m/s; the rotation speed of the Mars surface 
(v Subscript upper R upper M) is 240 m/s. Using these known values, we can calculate the time difference 
between different clocks using the relevant Lorentz factors. The predicted values 
of the effective time dilation factors in the above three models are summarized in 
Table 14.1. 
Since the effective time dilation factor ModifyingAbove gamma With quotation dash values are very close to 1.0, it may 
be more convenient to see their differences using another representation. Thus, we 
introduce a new term called “Time Dilation Ratio” (TDR), which is deﬁned as

also included in Table 14.1. 
14.3.2 
Calculation of the Total Time Dilation by Including 
the Gravitational Redshift Effect 
In the current literature, it has been proposed that time dilation can have multiple 
physical origins. That is, not only the relative motion between two inertial frames can 
give rise to time dilation (due to the “Lorentz factor” as discussed in the above); time 
dilation can also be resulted due to the gravitational potential difference of the two 
clocks. This understanding is based on the gravitational redshift effect. It has been 
demonstrated that, when an electromagnetic wave travels from a lower gravitational 
potential position to a higher gravitational potential position, its frequency becomes 
redshifted, such that,
StartFraction normal upper Delta nu Over nu EndFraction equals minus StartFraction normal upper Delta normal upper Phi Over c squared EndFraction
St a rtFraction normal upper Delta nu Over nu EndFraction equals minus StartFraction normal upper Delta normal upper Phi Over c squared EndFraction
Sta
rtFraction normal upper Delta nu Over nu EndFraction equals minus StartFraction normal upper Delta normal upper Phi Over c squared EndFraction
where normal u pper Delta nu equals nu Subscript upper B Baseline minus nu Subscript upper A is the difference in the light frequency, and no r mal  uper Delta normal upper Phi equals normal upper Phi Subscript upper B Baseline minus normal upper Phi Subscript upper A is 
the difference of the gravitational potential between the two points. This phenomenon 
is called “gravitational redshift of light” [11–16]. 
In general relativity, the gravitational redshift effect is interpreted as a conse-
quence of time dilation due to gravitational potential difference [11, 12]. It was 
thought that the clock at a higher gravitational potential runs faster than an identical 
clock located at a lower gravitational potential [11, 12]. Their clock rate difference is 
determined by the factor normal upper Delta normal upper Phi divided by c squared. In the quantum wave model discussed in this book, 
we have a different explanation for the gravitational redshift effect [17]. Recently, we 
showed that the gravitational redshift effect can also be explained based on quantum 
physics [17]. The key point is that, the gravitational mass of a photon is not its rest 
mass; instead, it is its quantum mass which can be determined from its momentum 
as described by the de Broglie relation [18]. Thus, the gravitational mass of a photon 
is not zero. Then, the condition of energy conservation will require a frequency shift 
when the photon travels between two points with different gravitational potentials. 
Therefore, the gravitational redshift of light is essentially a quantum effect [17]. (For 
details, please see Chap. 15). 
In the condition that the speed of the moving object is far less than the speed of 
light and the gravitational energy is far less than the resting mass energy, the time 
dilation caused by the gravitational redshift effect can be combined with the time 
dilation caused by the Lorentz factor [16], that is,

Fig. 14.8 A simpler 
experimental design for the 
clock paradox. Clock A is 
placed in a laboratory on 
Earth; Clock B is placed on a 
satellite that orbits the Sun in 
the opposite direction from 
Earth. One can compare the 
time dilation between Clock 
B (on the satellite) and Clock 
A (on Earth) 
Thus, if one includes the gravitational redshift effect into the calculation of time 
dilation between the Mars clock and the Earth clock, the result would be somewhat 
different from those presented in Table 14.1. Nevertheless, the STR prediction for 
the Earth-based view will still be different from that of the Mars-based view. So, the 
measured time dilation can clearly differentiate these two views. 
Technically, it is highly feasible to do this proposed experiment. Based on our 
calculation, the predicted time dilation between the Mars clock and the Earth clock is 
quite large. There is no problem for most atomic clocks to detect such time difference. 
Furthermore, if one wants to make the data analysis simpler, one can remove the 
gravitational redshift effect by launching a satellite ﬂying in the opposite direction 
of the Earth orbit. One can then compare the clocks on the satellite with those in the 
Earth laboratory (see Fig. 14.8). 
This experiment in fact is simpler to conduct and involves less technical chal-
lenges. The cost of doing this experiment is also less than that of comparing clocks 
between Mars and Earth. So, the proposed experiment as outlined in Fig. 14.8 is 
highly feasible. 
14.4 Chapter Summary 
• In this chapter, we discussed two proposed experiments for testing the Principle of 
Relativity. The ﬁrst experiment is to test whether the speed-dependence of moving 
mass is the same in different inertial frame. The second experiment is to test the 
famous Twin Paradox using extra-terrestrial clocks.

Experimental Tests on the Principle of Relativity and the Twin Paradox
• In the ﬁrst experiment, we propose to measure the moving mass of a particle 
traveling in different directions in reference to the solar system. We know the 
mass of a particle is not constant; it is dependent on its traveling speed. If the 
STR is correct, the moving mass should be the same regardless of the particle’s 
moving direction. But if the vacuum is a dielectric medium as proposed in the 
quantum wave model, there is a resting frame in our universe. One will observe a 
difference in the moving mass when the particle travels in different directions. 
• We predicted that the observed difference in the moving mass will change with 
the hours of the day if the vacuum is a universal resting frame. 
• The second proposed experiment is to test the Principle of Relativity based on 
the “Twin Paradox”. In the special theory of relativity, any inertial frame can be 
regarded as the stationary frame. There was a famous challenge to this hypothesis; 
it was called the “Twin Paradox”. 
• Previously, a very well-known experiment claiming to test the Twin Paradox was 
the experiment conducted by Hafele and Keating (in 1972), in which a set of 
clocks was carried by commercial airlines around the Earth; then, times were 
compared between these traveling clocks and clocks located in the laboratory. 
This experiment had certain limitations. In order to truly test the Twin Paradox, 
one needs to design a new experiment. That is, the clocks must be placed in two 
different inertial frames, where there is no acceleration and deceleration. 
• Since both the Earth and Mars are rotating around the Sun at almost constant 
speeds, each of them can be regarded as an independent inertial system in their 
own right. Furthermore, the moving speeds of the Earth and Mars are high enough 
and thus can easily generate a large time dilation effect which is not difﬁcult to 
measure. This is a very ideal situation to test the Twin Paradox.

A Quantum View of Photon Gravity: 
Implications of the Quantum Wave 
Model on General Relativity 
Today, it is well known that the theory of general relativity (GR) is incompatible with 
quantum mechanics (QM) [1–6]. First, QM is supposed to be a theory for explaining 
physical events in the microscopic world; it is applicable at the atomic or sub-atomic 
level. GR is a physical theory for explaining the macroscopic world; it is applicable 
at the cosmological level. Thus, the objects to be described by these two theories are 
very different. 
Second, all attempts to develop a quantum theory of gravity had failed. That is 
because the particle supposed to carry the gravitational force in the GR (graviton) 
has a spin equals to 2; it could not be renormalized. Thus, no one could develop a 
quantum gravitational theory based on GR. 
Finally, the concepts of vacuum in these two theories are very different. General 
relativity, as a classical theory, treats the vacuum as an empty space. In fact, it must 
assume that there is no resting frame in our Universe. Otherwise, one can use this 
universal resting frame (i.e., the vacuum) to determine whether an object is in motion 
or not. This would allow one to differentiate between an object under acceleration 
and an object resting under gravity. This would violate the principle of equivalence 
(PE). 
On the other hand, quantum mechanics treats the vacuum as the ground state of a 
complex physical system [7]. As shown in the quantum wave model discussed in this 
book, the vacuum has very rich physical properties. Furthermore, in the Standard 
Model of particle physics today, it is thought that virtual particle pairs can be created 
or annihilated instantly in the vacuum. When energy is provided, the virtual particles 
can become real particles. If the vacuum is just an empty space, it is not possible to 
explain where these real particles come from. 
Thus, there is a conceptual conﬂict between the empty vacuum assumption in GR 
and the non-empty vacuum assumption in QM. Now, we are facing a big problem. 
Which theory should we believe? In the past one hundred years, we know QM is 
supported by countless experimental evidence. There is no doubt about its validity. 
But GR also appears to be well supported too. In the literature, there had been many

experimental tests on the principle of equivalence of GR. All of them claimed that 
their results support the prediction of GR. Then, we must carefully review these 
experimental tests and to see if their original interpretations are indisputable or not. 
For example, could some of these experimental results be explained by more than 
one theory? Particularly, could these experimental observations be explained based 
on quantum physics instead of GR?1 
15.1 Does a Quantum Particle with no Rest Mass Interact 
with Gravity? 
One of the most convincing evidence for supporting the theory of general relativity 
(GR) is the discovery that light does not travel in a straight line in a gravitational 
ﬁeld. This ﬁnding is often cited as a deﬁnitive proof that space–time is curved by the 
presence of mass, as suggested by GR [8, 9]. In fact, many experiments aiming to test 
the GR were based on determining the gravitational effects of light, including (a) the 
observation of light bending near a star [10, 11], (b) lensing effect of a galaxy [12–15], 
(c) gravitational redshift of electromagnetic wave [16–19], and (d) discovery of black 
holes [20, 21]. All of these experiments involved measuring the behavior of light in 
a gravitational ﬁeld. So far, results of these experiments all claimed to be supportive 
of the GR [10–23]. However, there is still a question on whether such interpretation 
is unequivocal. Are there possible alternative interpretations? Can these observed 
gravitational effects of photon also be explained based on other physical principles? 
15.1.1 
What is the Gravitational Mass of a Photon? 
Thus, we have undertaken a careful investigation on whether the reported gravita-
tional effects of photon can be explained based on quantum physics. Most of the 
previous experimental tests in support of GR were based on the assumption that light 
has no gravitational mass and thus should not interact with gravity. Their methods 
were to examine the pathway of light near a gravitational ﬁeld. If light is observed 
to be bended near a gravitational source, it would indicate that the space–time is 
curved by the gravitational ﬁeld, as suggested by GR [10, 11, 15, 24]. For example, 
a very well-known experiment claiming to support GR was the experiment done by 
Eddington during a solar eclipse [10]. He reported that star light passing the edge of 
the Sun was bended by an angle consistent with Einstein’s calculation based on GR 
(see Fig. 15.1a). Similar experiments conducted later using radio-frequency wave 
also conﬁrmed that electromagnetic wave is bended near a star [11].

Another class of light-bending experiments is the observation of the “lensing 
effect” of certain galaxies [12–14, 25]. Many people had used such lensing effect to 
support GR [9, 18]. This lensing effect demonstrated that light passing a gravitational 
ﬁeld is not in a straight line. Thus, such ﬁndings are consistent with the prediction 
of general relativity which proclaims that space–time can be curved by the presence 
of mass. 
The design of these experiments, however, involved a questionable hidden 
assumption. That is, they assumed that, because photon has no rest mass, it should 
not interact with the gravitational ﬁeld; thus, light should travel in a straight line near 
a star according to Newton’s theory. 
But, is this assumption really correct? The key question here is: What is the 
gravitational mass of a particle? Is it the rest mass or the moving mass? 
According to the Newtonian theory of mechanics, the gravitational mass of an 
object is identical to the inertial mass of the same object. This understanding was 
also supported by Einstein [26–28]. Since the inertial mass of a particle is its moving 
mass, there should be no doubt that the gravitational mass of a quantum particle 
should be its moving mass. 
In Newton’s day, people thought the mass of an object is a constant. This under-
standing has changed now [29–32]. As we showed in Chap. 12, the inertial mass (m) 
of a particle increases with speed such that

where m 0 is the rest mass of the particle and v is the velocity of the particle as measured 
against a stationary frame [33]. For a massive particle, which is usually modeled as 
a point mass in the classical view, it is easy to calculate its inertial mass using the 
above equation. For a quantum particle such as the photon, the situation is slightly

208

more complicated. This is because the photon has no rest mass (i.e., m 0  equals 0). One 
may think that m 0  equals 0 implies m equals 0 according to Eq. (15.1). But this is not correct, 
because the speed of light is equal to c, so both the denominator and numerator of 
Eq. (15.1) are zero. The zero rest mass does not mean the moving mass (m) of a  
photon is zero. Then, we need to ﬁnd another way to calculate the inertial mass of a 
photon. 
Let us review ﬁrst on what is the meaning of mass in physics. In Newtonian 
mechanics, 
p equal
s m v comma
mass (m) is simply the proportional coefﬁcient between the particle’s momentum (p) 
and its velocity (v). In quantum mechanics, we know the momentum of a photon is 
given by the de Broglie relation, 
p e qua
ls italic h over two pi k comma
where k is the wave vector. We also know the speed of light is always c. Then, from 
Eqs. (15.2) and (15.3), we have 
m c  eq
uals italic h over two pi k
Thus, the inertial mass of a photon is 
m e quals StartFraction italic h over two pi k Over c EndFraction period
m e
quals StartFraction italic h over two pi k Over c EndFraction period
So, it is clear that, for a quantum particle with no rest mass (such as photon), it 
can still have a non-zero inertial mass; we may call it the “effective mass” or the  
“quantum mass”. 
Then, the gravitational mass of a photon is simply its quantum mass as given in 
Eq. (15.5). 
15.1.2 
The Quantum Interpretations of Light Deﬂection 
and Lensing Effects 
If one realized that the gravitational mass of a photon is not zero, one would 
expect that photon should naturally interact with a gravitational ﬁeld; that means the 
trajectory of light should not be a straight line near a star (see Fig. 15.1a). Thus, the 
design of the light-deﬂection experiments was on a faulty basis. Their experimental 
results could be explained either by the non-zero gravitational mass of a photon or 
by GR. It was ambiguous. (Of course, in the day of Eddington, people knew very

15.1 Does a Quantum Particle with no Rest Mass Interact with Gravity?
209
little about quantum mechanics; Eddington probably did not know that the quantum 
mass of a photon is not zero.) 
The realization of photon having a non-zero gravitational mass can also easily 
explain the observations of the “lensing effect” caused by certain galaxies [12–14, 25] 
(see Fig. 15.2). Many studies had used such lensing effect as evidence for supporting 
the prediction of GR that gravity is caused by space–time bending. Their conclu-
sions, however, were also based on a faulty assumption similar to the light-deﬂection 
experiment; namely, they assumed that the photon has no gravitational mass. But as 
we pointed out in the above, their assumption was wrong. The lensing effect of a 
galaxy can be easily explained based on the fact that photon has a non-zero quantum 
mass and so it can be deﬂected in the gravitational ﬁeld of a galaxy (see Fig. 15.1b). 
Once one recognizes that the photon has a non-zero gravitational mass, one can 
immediately predict that a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies can produce a lensing effect 
to light rays emitted from distant stars. In most galaxies, a large amount of matters 
(including ordinary matters as well as dark matters) are concentrated at the center; 
their distribution is almost disk-like. This produces a gravitational ﬁeld gradient. 
Since a photon has gravitational mass, its pathway will be bent by the galaxy’s 
gravitational force when a light ray passes through the galaxy. As a result, the galaxy 
would appear to act as a lens (see Figs. 15.1b and 15.2). 
Such lensing effect in fact is quite common in modern astrophysical studies. It 
was ﬁrst observed in the double-imaged quasar in 1979 [12]. Later, hundreds of 
gravitational lensing effects were reported by different groups [13]. For example, a 
strong lensing galaxy in the cluster IRC 0218 was identiﬁed using the Hubble Space 
Telescope. Due to its lensing effect, the image of the distant galaxy behind it was 
distorted to produce a counter image [24].

15.2 Origin of Black Holes 
In the literature, another type of evidence for supporting GR is the discovery of black 
holes. The black hole is an object that generates a very strong gravitational force such 
that even light cannot escape from it. In the last 30 years, many black holes have 
been observed in different places of our universe [20, 34]. Some of the black holes 
at the center of galaxies were found to be very massive, about many million times of 
the mass of our Sun [20]. 
The existence of black hole was reported to be one of the predictions given in 
GR [18, 34–36]. Thus, the observation of black holes is considered to be a strong 
evidence for supporting GR. However, with the realization that the photon has a non-
zero gravitational mass (m), one can also predict the existence of black hole based 
on the Newtonian gravitation theory. 
The behavior of photon in a gravitation ﬁeld is no different than an ordinary 
particle with mass. Suppose a massive object has a mass Mb, a particle (with moving 
mass m) ﬂying nearby this object will experience a gravitational force. Suppose the 
velocity of this moving particle is u and the perpendicular distance between the 
particle and the massive object is R (see Fig. 15.1c). In order for the particle not to 
fall into that object, it needs to have a centrifugal force at least equal to that of the 
gravitational force, i.e., 
StartFraction m u squared Over upper R EndFraction equals upper G StartFraction m upper M Subscript b Baseline Over upper R squared EndFraction comma

e
quals StartRoot StartFraction upper G upper M Subscript b Baseline Over upper R EndFraction EndRoot period
This is the velocity required for the moving particle to counter act the attractive 
gravitational force of the massive object; it is called the “escape velocity”. Now, if 
this escape velocity is equal to (or larger than) the speed of light (i.e., u greater than or equalsc), no 
particle (including photon) can escape the gravitational ﬁeld of this massive object. 
Since the maximum velocity for any particle is c, all ﬂying-by particles (including 
photons) will be captured by the massive object, which now becomes a “black hole” 
(see Fig. 15.3).
From Eq. (15.7), one can calculate the size of a black hole; its radius is 
up per R equals StartFraction upper G upper M Subscript b Baseline Over c squared EndFraction period

r R equals StartFraction upper G upper M Subscript b Baseline Over c squared EndFraction period
This radius is equivalent to the “event horizon” commonly used in describing a 
black hole. Thus, the existence of black holes not only can be explained based on 
GR, it can also be explained based on the non-zero quantum mass of a photon (and 
the Newtonian theory).

15.3 The Quantum Interpretation of Gravitational 
Redshift in Electromagnetic Waves 
15.3.1 
Gravitational Redshift of EM Wave According to GR 
In the literature, the most strong evidence cited for supporting the principle of equiv-
alence (PE) of GR was based on the measurements of the gravitational redshift of 
electromagnetic waves [16–19]. According to GR, time can be affected by gravity; 
and thus, it predicts that there should be a gravitational redshift of light [37]. Suppose 
a beam of laser light is transmitted from a ground station (point A) to a receiver in 
a satellite (point B) orbiting above the Earth (Fig. 15.4). The theory of GR predicts 
that the light ray will experience a gravitational redshift [38]

where v’ is the frequency of light at the satellite, v is the initial light frequency at 
the ground station, normal upper Delta phiis the difference of gravitational potential between point A 
and point B. Since the photon energy is much larger than the change of gravitational 
potential energy (i.e., c s qu ared greater than greater than normal upper Delta phi), one can apply Taylor’s expansion to the above 
equation and obtain

Now, denoting the change of frequency as normal upper Delta nu equals nu prime minus nu, the above relation gives

This is the well-known relation of gravitational redshift; it had been used in many 
experiments to test the validity of GR [16–18]. Such a relation is actually used in 
satellite communication today. For example, many receiver systems designed for 
satellite navigation are now incorporating the gravitational redshift effect as given 
in the above [39]. 
15.3.2 
Explanation of the Gravitational Redshift Effect 
Based on Quantum Physics 
So far, many experiment tests on the principle of equivalence (PE) were based on 
measuring the gravitational redshift effect of photon. Their data were all consistent 
with the prediction given in Eq. (15.11). Thus, it was claimed that the PE is well 
veriﬁed [18, 19, 23]. However, we found that the gravitational redshift effect can 
be explained in more than one way; besides the GR explanation, the gravitational

15.3 The Quantum Interpretation of Gravitational Redshift …
213
redshift effect can also be explained by the fact that the gravitational mass of a 
photon is not zero [40]. 
With the understanding that photon has a non-zero gravitational mass, one can 
easily explain why the frequency of light will change in a gravitational ﬁeld. Since 
a photon has moving mass, it can interact with the gravitational ﬁeld. This implies 
that, 
StartL ayout 1 st Ro w 1st C olumn Total en ergy of
 a pho ton 2nd Column  equals It s quantum energy 2nd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column plus Its gravitational potential energy period EndLayout
The quantum energy of a photon is given by Planck’s relation; its gravitational 
potential energy can be calculated based on the Newton’s Law. Thus, the total energy 
of a photon within a gravitational ﬁeld is 
upper E  Subscript
 total Baseline equals h nu plus m phi comma
where m is the quantum mass of the photon as given in Eq. (15.5), phiis its gravitational 
potential at a particular position. 
According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy of a photon 
moving freely in space should be conserved. When a photon moves from point A to 
point B and there is a gravitational potential difference between these two points, the 
photon will change its frequency from v to v’ in order to satisfy the requirement of 
conservation of energy. That is,
normal u pper Delta upper
 E Subscript total Baseline equals h normal upper Delta nu plus m normal upper Delta phi equals 0 comma
where normal upper Delta nu equals nu prime minus nu, and normal u pper Delta phi equals phi Subscript upper B Baseline minus phi Subscript upper A is the difference of the gravitational potential 
between point A and point B. By substituting Eq. (15.5) into Eq. (15.13), we get
StartFraction normal upper Delta nu Over nu EndFraction equals minus StartFraction normal upper Delta phi Over c squared EndFraction period
St a rtFraction normal upper Delta nu Over nu EndFraction equals minus StartFraction normal upper Delta phi Over c squared EndFraction period
Sta r
tFraction normal upper Delta nu Over nu EndFraction equals minus StartFraction normal upper Delta phi Over c squared EndFraction period
Thus, one can predict that the photon must be redshifted when it moves from 
the Earth surface to a satellite above the Earth (see Fig. 15.4). Hence, the gravi-
tational redshift of electromagnetic wave is a consequence of the fact that the 
gravitational mass of a photon is not zero. 
Very interestingly, our theoretical result obtained based on the quantum mass of 
a photon (i.e., Eq. 15.14) is identical to the theoretical result based on GR (i.e., 
Eq. 15.11). That means the gravitational redshift effect can be explained either 
based on GR or quantum physics. Thus, the observation of gravitational redshift 
cannot be regarded as an unequivocal evidence for supporting GR.

15.4 Testing the Principle of Equivalence by Measuring 
the Mass Variation Due to Speed Changes 
From the above discussions, one can see that most of the supporting evidence for GR 
are not unequivocal; they can also be explained by quantum physics. Thus, in order 
to critically evaluate the validity of GR, one needs to propose new experiments to 
directly test its basic hypothesis, the principle of equivalence (PE). 
Recently, we suggested that one possible way to test the principle of equivalence 
is to measure the moving mass of an object over time. We know the inertial mass of 
a particle is its moving mass, which varies with the particle’s velocity, 
m e

where γ is called the “Lorentz factor”. One can use the above relation to determine if a 
particle is at rest or under acceleration. The design of such an experiment is relatively 
simple. Suppose an object (with rest mass m0) is placed on top of a sophisticate 
“electronic balance” inside a rocket. The weight of this object is determined by 
the gravitational force and/or by the acceleration of the rocket. Let us consider two 
different motional states for the rocket (see Fig. 15.5): 
(A) The rocket is resting in a gravitational ﬁeld (gravitational acceleration = g). 
(B) The rocket is accelerating in space (acceleration = a) where there is no 
gravitational force. 
If the acceleration a = g, the weight of the object will appear the same in both 
Case A and Case B. This is the basis for PE. However, if one can continue to measure

situations: a The rocket is resting in a gravitational ﬁeld, and b the rocket is under acceleration 
without gravity; its acceleration rate a is the same as the gravitational rate g in a. According to GR, 
all physical experiments conducted within these two rockets should give identical results. Credit:

the weight of the object over a long period of time, it will be possible to determine 
whether the rocket is under acceleration or not. 
In this proposed experiment, the weight of the object will be measured as a func-
tion of time and see if there is any change in this weight. At the beginning of the 
experiment, one cannot differentiate if the rocket is in motion or not. One could 
think the rocket is resting in a gravitational ﬁeld (i.e., Case A) or under acceleration 
(with a = g) (i.e., Case B). But as time goes by, the speed of the rocket in case 
B should increase with time, while the speed of the rocket in Case A will remain 
unchanged. That means the moving mass of the object in Case B should increase 
with time, while the moving mass of the object in Case A should remain constant 
(see Fig. 15.6). Based on such a measurement, one can determine whether the rocket 
is resting under gravity or accelerating without gravity. 
One may worry that whether this proposed experiment is technologically feasible. 
The experimental design for measuring the moving mass of an object could be rela-
tively simple. For example, one can use a magnetic force (or electric force) to deter-
mine if the mass of an object inside the rocket has changed or not. The design of 
such an experimental apparatus is shown in our recent publication [41]. There could 
be other experimental designs for detecting whether the mass of an object inside the 
rocket can change due to acceleration. For example, one could use the Coulombic 
force between two charged objects to balance the gravitational force (or acceleration). 
A more sophisticated experiment can be done by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio 
of a charged particle using a mass spectrometer or a Penning trap [42, 43]. Using the
Fig. 15.6 Differentiation between an accelerating rocket and a rocket sitting in a gravitational 
ﬁeld. By measuring the mass variation over time, one can determine whether the rocket is under 
acceleration or resting in gravity. The red dashed line represents the Case A scenario that the rocket 
stays at rest in a gravitational ﬁeld. The blue solid line represents the Case B scenario that the rocket 
accelerates in space without gravity. Credit: This ﬁgure is reproduced from an earlier publication

advanced technology available at present, one can determine the mass-to-charge ratio 
of an electron to a precision of 10–8 [44]. This is more than sufﬁcient to determine 
whether the Lorentz factor γ would change due to rocket acceleration. 
In summary, there are multiple ways to determine the moving mass (inertial mass) 
of an object when this object is placed inside a rocket in motion. Since the moving 
mass is a function of speed as given in Eq. (15.15), it is not difﬁcult to differentiate 
whether an object is resting in gravity or accelerating without gravity. Under this 
situation, one can experimentally determine whether the principle of equivalence is 
true or not. 
15.5 Re-examination of Eddington’s Eclipse Expedition 
Experiment: Did It Prove that GR is the Correct 
Gravitational Theory While the Newtonian 
Gravitational Theory is not? 
In the above discussion, we followed the modern practice that the test of general 
relativity is based on whether light can pass through a gravitational ﬁeld in a straight 
line or not. This is a standard argument today. For example, Stephen Hawking wrote 
in his famous book “A Brief History of Time”: 
the fact that space is curved (according to general relativity) means that light no longer 
appears to travel in straight lines in space. So general relativity predicts that light should be 
bent by gravitational ﬁelds [6]. 
Some people may take issue with this statement, because according to the famous 
Eddington experiment conducted during the 1919 eclipse expedition, it was claimed 
that the predicted difference between Newton’s Law and general relativity is not 
whether light will be deﬂected in a gravitational ﬁeld; the difference is the degree of 
deﬂection [10]. And this was what Eddington’s experiment tried to determine. It was 
widely reported that their experimental results clearly supported the gravitational 
theory of Einstein over the gravitational theory of Newton [10]. 
This report had tremendous inﬂuence on people’s subsequent acceptance of the 
GR. So, let us re-examine it carefully in detail. 
15.5.1 
What Did Eddington’s Experiment Really Test? 
The ﬁrst serious test of Einstein’s theory of general relativity was the light deﬂec-
tion experiment conducted by Arthur Eddington’s team in 1919 [10]. In the Newto-
nian theory of gravity, light should travel in straight lines in the gravitational ﬁeld. 
Einstein’s general relativity, however, predicted that light should be bent near a 
gravitational source, such as the Sun. This prediction can be tested by measuring the

217
position of stars near the Sun during an eclipse. This was the goal of the experiment 
conducted by the British astronomer, Arthur Eddington at 1919 [10]. 
More speciﬁcally, the Eddington experiment was designed to test three possibil-
ities: (1) the classical light theory, (2) the general relativity proposed in Einstein’s 
1911 paper, and (3) the general relativity proposed by Einstein’s 1916 paper (see 
Table 15.1) [10]. 
In Einstein’s 1911 paper entitled “On the inﬂuence of gravity on the propagation 
of light” (Über den Einﬂuß der Schwerkraft auf die Ausbreitung des Lichtes, Annalen 
der Physik, 35, 1911) [37], he predicted that based on the principle of equivalence, 
light could be deﬂected near a gravitational source (such as the Sun). His prediction 
of light deﬂection near the gravitational ﬁeld was not based on the realization that the 
photon has non-zero gravitational mass. Instead, Einstein thought that the speed of 
light would change in the gravitational ﬁeld due to the principle of equivalence. Thus, 
“by means of Huyghens’s principle, that light-rays propagated across a gravitational 
ﬁeld undergo deﬂexion” [37, 45]. This is somewhat similar to the observation of light 
deﬂection at the air–water boundary. Einstein acknowledged that this thinking of light 
speed change could be in conﬂict with the 2nd postulate in his 1905 special relativity 
paper [46]. 
This prediction is different from the conventional Newtonian theory, which 
predicts that light should not be bent. So, one can test it. After the publication of 
the 1911 paper [37], Einstein had actively searched for astronomers to conduct the 
experimental test of his calculation result. A young astronomer from Berlin named 
Erwin Freundlich was interested in the project and took the job. They planned to 
conduct their measurement for the eclipse to be taken place on August 21, 1914, 
in the Crimea. Unfortunately, just twenty days before the eclipse, the World War I 
started and Germany declared war on Russia. Freundlich and his German colleagues 
were captured by Russian soldiers. This experimental test was abolished [47]. 
Later, when Einstein developed a more completed theory of general relativity in 
1916 [26], he found the predicted deﬂection angle was twice as large as what he 
predicted in the 1911 paper [26, 37]. 
At 1918, a team of British astronomers, including Arthur Eddington and Sir Frank 
Dyson, decided to conduct an experiment to test Einstein’s theory of general rela-
tivity. So, they organized an expedition to measure the deﬂection of star light by the

Sun during the May 29, 1919, eclipse. They sent out two teams to do the measure-
ment. One team went to Sobral in Brazil while the other team went to Principe near 
the equator in Africa [10]. 
When the expedition experiment was done, they found the result was closer to the 
prediction of Einstein’s second paper. When they publish their report in 1920, they 
somehow changed the emphasis of their experiment. Particularly, they changed the 
model #2 of Table 15.1 (i.e., the prediction of Einstein’s general relativity in 1911) 
to the prediction of Newtonian gravitation theory. In their words, Possibility #2 
became: “The energy or mass of light is subject to gravitation in the same way as 
ordinary matter. If the law of gravitation is strictly the Newtonian law, this leads 
to an apparent displacement of a star close to the sun’s limb amounting to 0"·87 
outwards” [10]. 
This description is clearly different from what Einstein discussed in his 1911 
paper [37]. First, in Einstein’s 1911 paper, light was treated as an electromagnetic 
wave; it was not treated as “ordinary matter”. Second, the calculation of deﬂection 
angle in Einstein’s 1911 paper was based on the principle of equivalence, not based 
on “strictly the Newtonian law”.2 As to why Eddington mis-represented the essence 
of Einstein’s 1911 paper, we are highly curious. One possible reason is for generating 
sensational publicity. Indeed, the expedition experiment was widely reported in many 
major press with very sensational headlines, such as “Revolution in science” and 
“New Theory of the Universe: Newtonian Ideas Overthrown” [48]. 
Another problem with Eddington’s report on the 1919 solar eclipse experiment 
is that the quality of their data was really not conclusive. As pointed out by Stephen 
Hawking, “It is ironic, therefore, that later examination of the photographs taken 
on that expedition showed the errors were as great as the effect they were trying to 
measure. Their measurement had been sheer luck, or a case of knowing the result 
they wanted to get, not an uncommon occurrence in science” [6]. 
In conclusion, if their data were accurate, it may conclude that the 1911 version of 
Einstein’s GR is wrong. The measurement made by Eddington in the 1919 expedition 
experiment only showed that Einstein’s 1916 GR paper gave a better prediction than 
Einstein’s 1911 GR paper. 
15.6 Outstanding Questions on GR that Need to Be 
Investigated 
GR is a very important theory today, particularly in cosmology. Thus, in the future it 
will be highly worthwhile to design new experiments to critically test it. Currently, 
there are several key questions about GR that need to be investigated:
2 In the calculation, Einstein also made use of the common relation n o r mal upper Phi equals minus k m divided by r, which is from 
the Newtonian theory. 

15.6 Outstanding Questions on GR that Need to Be Investigated
219
(1) How can mass curve space–time? What is the physical mechanism? A major 
proposal by Einstein in his 1916 paper is that the space–time of our Universe can 
be curved by the presence of mass. This is a very bold assumption. Is there any 
experimental evidence that the space–time of our Universe is indeed curved? 
Are we living in a ﬂat four-dimensional space–time or a curved space–time? 
Furthermore, why and how can the presence of mass or energy change the 
curvature of our space–time? This is a conjecture proposed by Einstein. But 
to prove a conjecture, one needs solid physical evidence. What is the physical 
basis for the curving of space–time by mass or energy? Einstein did not explain 
that in his original paper. After one hundred years, we still have not found its 
physical basis. So, whoever wants to use general relativity as a law of nature 
will have the burden to explain what is the physical basis to make the presence 
of the mass to curve the space–time. 
(2) Is PE correct? Einstein started his general relativity based on the principle of 
equivalence. As we pointed out above, up to this time, we have not yet found 
unequivocal evidence to verify the validity of PE. Of course, many experiments, 
including light bending experiment, lensing experiment, etc., had claimed to 
verify the principle of equivalence. But, as we show in this chapter, these exper-
imental results can also be explained by the fact that the gravitational mass of 
a photon is not zero. Another class of experiments which claimed to support 
the principle of equivalence is gravitational redshift. However, as shown in the 
above sections, that can also be explained based on quantum physics. Thus, the 
experiments claiming to support PE were unequivocal. Therefore, in order to 
fully verify the principle of equivalence, future scientists must come up with 
some critical experiments to test that. 
(3) Can PE be applied to other forces? In the original paper of Einstein, the prin-
ciple of equivalence was proposed to connect between the acceleration of an 
inertial system and the presence of gravitational force. Since all forces involve 
acceleration, not only gravitational force, other forces such as electromagnetic 
forces also involve acceleration. Would the principle of equivalence also apply 
to these other forces? In fact, the gravitational force is the weakest force among 
the known four forces in nature. The electric force is 1038 times stronger than 
the gravitational force. That means the acceleration involved for electric force 
is very strong. Is there any experimental evidence indicating that the principle 
of equivalence may be applied to electric force? 
(4) Would electric or magnetic charge also curve the space–time? If the principle 
of Equivalence is a law of nature, it would suggest that other forces can also be 
equivalent to acceleration. In that case, if the gravitational force is explained by 
the presence of the mass curving the space–time, should the presence of electric 
charge also curve the space–time? We know the electric force is much stronger 
than the gravitational force; that means the ability of the electric charge to curve 
the space–time should also be much stronger than the gravitational mass. Since 
one can measure the results of a much stronger effect more easily than a much 
weaker effect, should we have already observed many experimental evidence

that the space–time around the electric charge or a magnetic charge is highly 
curved? Do we have that evidence? 
15.7 Chapter Summary 
• Most of the previous experimental tests in support of GR were based on the 
assumption that light has no gravitational mass and thus should not interact with 
gravity. This assumption was not correct. The gravitational mass of a photon is 
its inertial mass, which is not zero. 
• The momentum of a photon is given by the de Broglie relation and the speed of 
light is always c. So, the photon has a non-zero inertial mass, which is equal to 
m = èk/c. 
• If one realizes that the gravitational mass of a photon is not zero, one expects 
that photon should naturally interact with a gravitational ﬁeld; that means the 
trajectory of light is not a straight line near a star. It should be bent. 
• The realization of photon having a non-zero gravitational mass can also explain 
the “lensing effect” observed in some galaxies. Furthermore, with the knowledge 
that light has non-zero gravitational mass, one can predict the existence of black 
holes based on the Newtonian gravitation theory. 
• In the literature, the strongest evidence for supporting the GR was based on 
the observations of gravitational redshift in electromagnetic waves. This effect, 
however, can also be explained by quantum physics. It can be shown that the 
gravitational redshift of electromagnetic wave is a consequence of the fact that 
the gravitational mass of a photon is not zero and the requirement of energy 
conservation when photon travels between two points with different gravitational 
potentials. Therefore, the gravitational redshift effect can be explained either 
based on GR or quantum physics. 
• The general theory of relativity (GR) is based on the principle of equivalence 
(PE). We proposed a new experiment to directly test the validity of PE. The key 
is to measure the mass of a moving object over time. There are multiple ways to 
determine the moving mass of an object when this object is placed inside a rocket. 
Since the moving mass is a function of speed, it is not difﬁcult to differentiate 
whether an object is resting in gravity or accelerating without gravity. Under this 
situation, one can experimentally determine whether the principle of equivalence 
is true or not. 
• We re-examine the famous eclipse expedition experiment conducted by 
Eddington’s team in 1919. It had been widely reported that this experiment clearly 
proved that GR is the correct gravitational theory while the Newtonian gravita-
tional theory is not. Our re-examination showed that this claim could not be 
substantiated. 
• Finally, we listed a number of outstanding questions on GR that need to be 
investigated.

Further Thoughts on Quantum Physics 
The quantum wave model discussed in this book is intended to provide a funda-
mental understanding of quantum physics at the sub-atomic level. For things on 
smaller scales, at the subnuclear level, today’s physics community relies on quantum 
ﬁeld theories, commonly referred to as the “Standard Model of Particle Physics”. 
This Standard Model has been shown to be very successful in agreeing with exper-
imental observations. However, today’s Standard Model still cannot fully explain 
many fundamental questions. For examples: 
• What is the origin of rest mass in the elementary particle? 
• According to the Standard Model, the mass of an elementary particle is obtained 
from a coupling between its quantum ﬁeld and the Higgs ﬁeld. Is this Higgs 
mechanism consistent with general relativity? How can a coupling constant with 
the Higgs ﬁeld curve the space–time, as proposed in the GR? 
• What is the physical meaning of anti-mass? What is its origin? 
• Why are particle and anti-particle created in pair? Does it imply that the vacuum 
is ﬁlled with a “Dirac sea” of an inﬁnite number of negative-energy particles? 
• What is the origin of electric charge? Why can some particles have electric charge? 
Where does the negative charge or positive charge come from? 
In this chapter, we would like to explore if the quantum wave model can offer 
some useful ideas to help to resolve the above questions. 
16.1 
Essence of the Standard Model of Particle Physics 
The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing our current under-
standing of elementary particles. It was developed in the second half of the twentieth 
century through the work of many scientists worldwide. The current formulation was 
completed around the mid-1970s.

Further Thoughts on Quantum Physics
The development of the Standard Model was driven by both theoretical and exper-
imental particle physicists. The Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum ﬁeld 
theory. More speciﬁcally, it is a gauge quantum ﬁeld theory based on the internal 
symmetries of the unitary product group SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1). In 1954, two young 
theoretical physicists, C.N. Yang and R. Mills, proposed to use nonabelian groups for 
the gauge theory to explain strong interactions [1]. Their work inspired others to use 
the nonabelian groups to investigate the weak force. In 1961, S. Glashow combined 
the electromagnetic and weak interactions [2]. In 1967, S. Weinberg [3] and A. Salam 
[4] incorporated the Higgs mechanism [5–7] into Glashow’s electroweak interaction, 
giving it its modern form. 
The Standard Model describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental 
interactions using mediating gauge bosons (see Fig. 16.1). The species of gauge 
bosons are photons, W−, W + and Z bosons, and eight gluons. The Standard Model 
also has 24 fundamental fermions (12 particles and their associated anti-particles), 
which are the constituents of all matter. The quarks can combine to form composite 
particles, accounting for the hundreds of species of particles that were observed in 
experiment so far. The Higgs mechanism is believed to give rise to the masses of all 
elementary particles in the Standard Model. This includes the masses of the W+− 
and Z bosons, and the masses of fermions (i.e., the quarks and leptons).
The Standard Model has been shown to agree with almost all experimental tests 
conducted up to now. However, many particle physicists believe that it is an incom-
plete description of nature, and a more fundamental theory will be discovered in the 
future. Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent, 
it leaves a lot of physical phenomena unexplained. There are still many questions 
remaining to be answered. It is well aware in the physics community that the Standard 
Model (in the present form) has certain limitations. For example: 
• It cannot explain the observed predominance of matter over anti-matter. 
• It cannot explain gravitation. 
• The model does not contain any viable particles that can constitute dark matter. 
• It does not explain the recent ﬁndings of neutrino oscillations and their non-zero 
masses. 
• Many scientists consider the Standard Model to be ad hoc in nature, requiring 19 
numerical parameters whose values are arbitrary and can only be determined by 
experiments [8]. 
• It is believed that explaining neutrino mass will require an additional 7 or 8 ﬁtting 
parameters for the Standard Model [9]. 
Thus, there is still a long way to go for physicists to develop a comprehensive 
theory that can explain our physical world from the subnuclear scale to the cosmos 
scale. There is no wonder why many physicists in recent years are exploring new theo-
ries beyond the Standard Model (e.g., string theory, brane theory, super-symmetry, 
etc.). These new theories, however, are not supported by experiments in spite of many 
years of trying. There were doubts on whether these theories could work [10–12].

Conceptual Difference Between the Standard Model 
and the Quantum Wave Model: Particle Versus 
Waveticle 
Today, there are still many unanswered questions about fundamental physics. They 
cannot be answered by the current version of the Standard Model. As we have shown 
in the earlier chapters of this book, some of these questions can be answered using 
new ideas suggested in the quantum wave model. (For details, see the following 
discussions.) 
The Standard Model and the quantum wave model use very different starting 
points. In the Standard Model, particle is conceptually regarded as a “point mass”. 
In the quantum ﬁeld theory, the particle is an excitation of its own ﬁeld. For example, 
photons are excitations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and electrons are quantum exci-
tations of the electron ﬁeld. Since there are many different types of sub-atomic 
particles, one must assume the existence of many different quantum ﬁelds. Then, 
people must wonder: Why does nature need so many different quantum ﬁelds?

228
16
Further Thoughts on Quantum Physics
Where do these quantum ﬁelds come from? What is the physical nature of all these 
quantum ﬁelds? So far, these questions have not been satisfactorily answered. 
In the Standard Model, the properties of the particle, including rest mass, electric 
charge, and spin, are pre-existing inherent properties of the particle. They cannot be 
derived from the model. 
In the quantum wave model, it was hypothesized that all free particles are exci-
tation waves of the vacuum; they just represent different excitation modes. In this  
way, one does not need to deal with many different ﬁelds; one can only deal with one 
common wave medium, i.e., the vacuum medium. Here, all particles are quantized 
excitation waves in the form of solitons. Not only photons, but all sub-atomic parti-
cles, including electrons and neutrinos, are quantized wave packets of the vacuum 
medium. 
In this case, the inherent properties of the so-called “particle” could be derived 
from the model. For example, as we have shown in Chaps. 7 and 11, the mass of the 
particle is found to be associated with the wavelength in the transverse oscillation 
of the traveling wave packet. This gives the mass a physical meaning at the same 
footing as energy and momentum. 
We think it is misleading to call the quantum object a “particle”. The word 
“particle” implies that the sub-atomic particle behaves as a “point mass”, some-
what like a tiny billiard ball. This is clearly not true [13–15]. In the case of photon, 
we know it is a quantized electromagnetic wave. In the case of electron, the Bragg 
diffraction experiment and the double-slit experiment clearly indicated that it does 
not behave like a point mass in the classical sense [16, 17]. 
A second reason for rejecting the name “particle” is that an electron cannot be 
described as a point object in the classical way. In classical mechanics, one can 
describe an object by both its position and momentum. But in quantum mechanics, 
the position and momentum of an electron cannot be determined simultaneously [18]. 
The only explanation is that the quantum object is a wave packet rather than a point 
mass [13] (see Fig.  16.2).
Therefore, it is misleading to call the electron or photon a “particle”. We need 
to ﬁnd a better term to describe such quantum objects. One may call them “wave/ 
particles”. However, this name is a little bit long; thus, we suggest simplifying it by 
calling them “waveticles”. With this new name, the quantum nature of wave-particle 
duality for electrons and photons becomes more clear (see Fig. 16.2). 
In the following discussion, we will use the word “waveticle” to describe the 
quantum particle according to the quantum wave model.

Fig. 16.2 Conceptual view of a particle in the Standard Model of particle physics versus that 
in the quantum wave model. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the particle is like a point 
mass. The mass of the particle is acquired from the interaction between the particle ﬁeld and the 
hypothetical Higgs ﬁeld. In the quantum wave model, the quantum particle is a quantized excitation 
wave of the vacuum medium. It is more appropriate to call it a “waveticle”. The mass of the waveticle 
is determined from the dispersion relation of the excitation wave
16.3 
What is the Origin of the Rest Mass? What is 
the Physical Meaning of Anti-Mass? 
We know the universe is made up of particles; most of which have a rest mass. Where 
does this rest mass come from? Do particles obtain their mass from interaction with 
the Higgs ﬁeld, as suggested in the Standard Model? 
In the quantum ﬁeld theory, a particle is regarded as an excitation of a ﬁeld. Then, 
how can a particle acquire mass? According to the Standard Model, the mass of the 
particle is acquired through their interaction with the Higgs ﬁeld, the excitation of 
which is a scalar particle called “the Higgs boson” [19]. In the Standard Model, the 
gauge ﬁeld is introduced solely to allow the Lagrangian density to be invariant under 
a local gauge transformation [20]. The excitations of this ﬁeld are the gauge bosons. 
The gauge boson originally has no mass. The gauge boson acquires mass due to its 
interaction with a hypothetical Higgs ﬁeld with a broken symmetry. This mechanism 
was proposed by Higgs and others in the mid-1960s [5–7]. According to the Standard 
Model, not only the gauge boson particles (W+, W − and Z) acquire their rest mass 
due to their interaction with the Higgs ﬁeld, leptons and quarks also acquire their 
mass in a similar way [3, 4, 21]. 
The Higgs particle had been theorized for a long time but was not veriﬁed in 
experiment until ten years ago. Experiments to hunt for the Higgs boson started at 
CERN around 2008 using the newly built Large Hadron Collider (LHC). On July 
2012, two experimental groups at LHC reported independently that they found a new 
particle with a mass of about 125 GeV, which could be the Higgs boson [22, 23].

Further Thoughts on Quantum Physics
There was a lot of excitement in the physics community about their ﬁndings. Their 
results were considered to be a major triumph of the Standard Model! 
16.3.1 
What is the Problem with the Higgs Model of Mass 
Acquisition? 
In the Higgs model, the rest mass of a particle is just a parameter associated with 
the strength of coupling between the particle ﬁeld and the Higgs ﬁeld. This thinking 
raises several conceptual problems. First, the physical meaning of the rest mass m 
deﬁned in this way would be intrinsically different from energy E or momentum p. 
This does not seem to be very satisfactory in view of our traditional understanding 
of the physics concept. 
Second, the Higgs mechanism does not seem to be consistent with the hypothesis 
of GR. How can a coupling constant between the particle ﬁeld and the Higgs ﬁeld 
cause a curving in space–time? 
Third, how can the mass generated from Higgs convert to energy, or vice versa? 
Fourth, the origin of the Higgs ﬁeld is entirely based on conjecture. It is very 
strange. What is the physical origin of the Higgs ﬁeld? What is the physical meaning 
of the Higgs particle? It is neither a kind of matter, nor is it a kind of force-carrier. 
Finally, there seems to be a conceptual difﬁculty in the Higgs model. It is very 
difﬁcult to use common-sense ideas to explain to a layman how particle may acquire 
mass through the Higgs mechanism. In the last 40 years, various analogies have 
been invented to describe the particle’s interaction with the Higgs ﬁeld, including 
analogies with a number of symmetry-breaking effects, such as the formation of 
rainbow from sunlight, separation of color using a prism, and resistance affecting 
some objects moving through syrup or snow [24]. However, none of these analogies 
appears to be satisfactory. In fact, analogies based on simple resistance to motion are 
misleading, since the Higgs ﬁeld does not work by resisting motion of the particle. 
Furthermore, what is the physical meaning of anti-mass according to the Higgs 
model? In the Standard Model, the particle itself does not have rest mass. The rest 
mass comes from the interaction between the particle and the hypothetic Higgs ﬁeld. 
Then, how can one explain the origin of anti-mass. We know nature has both particles 
and anti-particles. The anti-particles do not carry “mass”; they carry “anti-mass”. 
What does anti-mass mean according to the Higgs mechanism? We know mass is 
related to energy. If one believes the particle behaves like a point mass, does anti-
mass mean negative energy? Can the Higgs mechanism within the Standard Model 
explain that?

16.3 What is the Origin of the Rest Mass? What is the Physical Meaning …
231
16.3.2 
The Explanation of Mass and Anti-Mass 
in the Quantum Wave Model is Far Simpler 
In the quantum wave model, this question can be answered in a more natural way. 
We have shown in Chaps. 7 and 11 that the rest mass of a particle is actually associ-
ated with script l, the  “transverse wave number” of the free particle. Recall that a quantum 
wave packet is undergoing both the translational motion and the transverse oscillation 
following the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. The transverse oscillation is charac-
terized by a “transverse wave length” (lamda Subscript upper T ). The rest mass of the particle is shown 
to be proportional to the “transverse wave number”, which is deﬁned as s cr ipt l equals StartFraction 2 pi Over lamda Subscript upper T Baseline EndFraction
script l equals StartFraction 2 pi Over lamda Subscript upper T Baseline EndFraction
. 
This interpretation actually makes good sense, because now the energy, momentum, 
and mass can all mean similar things: the energy (E) is inversely proportional to 
the wavelength in the time dimension; the momentum (p) is inversely proportional 
to the wavelength in the longitudinal spatial dimension; and the rest mass (m0) is  
inversely proportional to the wavelength in the transverse spatial dimension. Since 
“the inverse of wavelength” is a measure of the curvature of bending the wave 
medium, the particle properties, including energy, momentum, and rest mass, are  all  
related to the curvature of bending the vacuum medium during the propagation of 
the excitation wave. Thus, the meaning of mass will be at the same footing as energy 
and momentum. 
Now, what about anti-mass? Can one explain anti-mass according to the quantum 
wave model? The answer is yes. Since the rest mass of the waveticle is related to 
the transverse wave number script l, it would suggest that the anti-mass is associated with 
the negative transverse wave number negative script l. One may recall that in the quantum wave 
model, the wave packet representing a massive particle (i.e., the waveticle) looks 
like a vortex wave. In the direction perpendicular to the trajectory of the particle, the 
wave packet oscillates following the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. This transverse 
wave number is script l. So, for the particle (waveticle) with anti-mass, it simply means 
that it has a negative transverse wave number negative script l. That would mean the oscillation of 
the excitation wave in the transverse direction is in an opposite phase (see Fig. 16.3).
Since the waveticle with positive and negative script l oscillates following the same 
Bessel function with identical wavelength, the magnitudes of the mass and anti-mass 
are the same. But because they oscillate at opposite phase, their ± signs become 
opposite. 
Thus, the quantum wave model not only explains the origin of mass for the 
quantum particles, but also explains the physical basis of anti-mass.

comparing to a particle. They 
both follow the same Bessel 
function
16.4 
What is the Origin of Electric Charge in a Quantum 
Particle? 
A quantum particle (such as an electron) not only has mass and spin, it also has 
electric charge. What is the origin of charge? 
In the conventional quantum ﬁeld theory, the origin of charge is totally unknown. 
It regards “electric charge” as an inherent property of the particle. Thus, the origin 
of charge cannot be explained in the Standard Model. 
This question can be answered in the quantum wave model discussed in this book. 
Here, we can ﬁnd a way to explain the origin of electric charge in a quantum particle. 
The key is that the charge comes from the vacuum medium. 
According to the quantum wave model, the vacuum behaves like a dielectric 
medium. That means, the quantum vacuum is composed of a mixture of very reﬁned 
primordial positive charges and negative charges. Thus, the quantum vacuum can be 
regarded as a superposition of two charged mediums, i.e., the negatively charged “n-
type medium” and the positively charged “p-type medium”. (For details, see Chap. 6.) 
Since the vacuum contains exactly the same amount of n-type medium and p-type 
medium, it has zero net charge at the resting state. The vacuum is entirely electrically 
neutral. 
In the quantum wave model, the elementary particles are simply quantized exci-
tation waves of the vacuum medium. (The “particle” is now called a “waveticle”.). 
When there is an excitation wave generated in the vacuum, the primordial charges 
will be separated at the point of excitation. There can be three different possibili-
ties: (1) The excitation wave could contain an equal amount of n-type medium and 
p-type medium, and thus is electrically neutral. This is like the case of a photon. 
(2) The excitation wave may contain mainly the n-type medium, and it will have a 
negative charge; the waveticle will become a particle with negative charge (such as 
an electron). (3) The excitation wave may contain mainly the p-type medium, and 
the waveticle will become a particle with positive charge (such as a positron).

16.5 What is the Origin of Anti-Particle? What is the Physical Basis …
233
Thus, the charge of the waveticle depends on whether it is a wave packet primarily 
generated from the n-type medium or the p-type medium. 
In the quantum wave model discussed in this book, one can explicitly calculate 
the charge contained within the quantized wave packet in theory. As we showed in 
Chap. 7, the  wave function of the quantum wave equation ψ essentially represents 
the electric vector potential Z, which is related to the charge displacement D by the 
relation, bo l d  u pper D equals nabla times bold upper Z. Now, using the Gauss Law n a bla  dot bold upper D equals rho Subscript e Baseline commaone can associate the 
quantum wave function ψ with the charge density rho Subscript e. Thus, it is possible to calculate 
the charge contained within a waveticle. 
16.5 
What is the Origin of Anti-Particle? What is 
the Physical Basis of Pair-Creation? 
In nature, every type of particle has its own anti-particle. Why does nature need to 
have anti-particles? Furthermore, particle and anti-particle are often created in pair, 
why? 
Historically, the origin of anti-particle was ﬁrst proposed by Dirac. In Dirac’s 
model, he assumed an inﬁnite number of negative-energy electrons are pre-existing 
in the vacuum. When this “Dirac sea” of negative-energy electrons are excited by a 
sudden energy input, such as an incoming gamma ray, one of the negative-energy elec-
trons can be kicked up to become a positive-energy electron, with a hole left behind. 
This hole will behave like an anti-particle of electron. Since an electron carries 
negative charge, the hole will have the opposite electric charge; it now becomes a 
positively charged positron. This is the explanation of the origin of anti-particles. 
In the quantum wave model, there is no need to assume the pre-existence of an 
inﬁnite “Dirac sea” of negative-energy electrons. It is easy to explain the origin of 
anti-particles from the wave view. According to the quantum wave model, the vacuum 
is a dielectric medium which is composed of a superposition of the negatively charged 
n-type medium and the positively charged p-type medium. At the resting state, the 
positive charges and the negatives charges are exactly balanced so that the vacuum 
medium is electrically neutral. When the vacuum is excited to generate a nega-
tively charged waveticle representing an electron, the unbalanced positive charges 
left behind will form another waveticle with opposite charges, which becomes the 
anti-particle positron (see Fig. 16.4).
So, the creation of anti-particle is mainly for satisfying the requirement of conser-
vation of charge in the vacuum. In fact, the pair-creation of particle and anti-particle 
also can satisfy the requirements of conservation of momentum and conservation of 
spin. When a negatively charged excitation wave is created in the vacuum, another 
excitation wave with positive charges must also be created. These two wave packets 
have opposite momentum. They travel at the same speed but in opposite directions, 
when one waveticle goes to the left, the other waveticle goes to the right. They also 
carry opposite spins.

234
16
Further Thoughts on Quantum Physics
Fig. 16.4 Pair-creation of particle and anti-particle. Pair-creation of particle and anti-particle is 
mainly due to the requirements of conservation of charge, momentum, and spin. This is a conceptual 
illustration of the pair-creation of electron–positron pair from the vacuum medium. The excitation 
of the vacuum medium in the middle generates a wave packet of a positron to the left (red) and a 
wave packet of electron to the right (green)
From the foregoing argument, one can easily see why in nature, particle and 
anti-particle must be created in pairs. If a particle is created without generating an 
accompanying anti-particle, it will be impossible to satisfy the condition of conser-
vation of charge in the vacuum. The amount of net charge in the non-exciting vacuum 
must always be kept at zero due to the exact balance between the negatively charged 
“n-type medium” and the positively charged “p-type medium”. 
16.6 
Chapter Summary 
• In this chapter, we discuss the similarity and difference between the basic ideas 
of the quantum wave model and the Standard Model of particle physics. 
• At present, there are still many important questions that the Standard Model cannot 
fully explain. The quantum wave model may offer some new ideas for inspiration. 
• Unlike the Standard Model which assumes that nature has many different quantum 
ﬁelds, the quantum wave model hypothesizes that all free particles are excitation 
waves of one single wave medium, i.e., the vacuum. 
• We point out that a quantum particle such as an electron is not like a point mass. It is  
a quantized excitation wave of the vacuum medium. Thus, it is more appropriate to 
call the quantum object (such as an electron) a “waveticle” instead of a “particle”.

Chapter 17 
Investigating the Quantum Properties 
of Nucleons from a Wave View 
In this book, we proposed that free particles are excitation waves of the vacuum. 
These free particles (we call them “waveticles”) include photons, electrons, and 
other leptons. They are stand-alone particles with no internal sub-component. On the 
other hand, we know other sub-atomic particles (such as protons and neutrons) are 
composed of sub-particles (quarks). These composite particles are called “hadrons”. 
Are these hadrons excitation waves of the vacuum too? 
We think the answer is “yes”. However, there are basic differences between the 
elementary particles discussed so far and the hadrons. The size of the photons and 
electrons is apparently relatively large (in comparison with an atomic nucleus). Their 
wave packet could be very long (say, in the order of nanometer or longer). The size 
of a hadron is very small; the size of a proton is estimated to be less than 10–15 m. 
Apparently, the size of quarks must be even smaller. (Note: the current estimated 
size of the quark is in the order of 10–18 m.) 
In nature, there are long-range and short-range forces. We think the photon/ 
lepton and the hadron/quark belong to two different types of excitation waves of the 
vacuum. Photons and leptons are excitation waves driven by the long-range force, 
which is the electromagnetic force. The hadrons and quarks are quantized excitation 
waves of the vacuum driven by the short-range forces, which include the strong and 
weak nuclear forces. 
At present, we have very good knowledge about the physical properties of the 
long-range force. They are basically described by the Maxwell equations. Thus, we 
can derive the wave equations for the free particles associated with the excitation 
waves of the long-range force. For the short-range forces, their physical properties 
are not yet clearly known. At this time, it is not possible to write down the quantum 
wave equations for hadrons or quarks. Thus, there are many outstanding questions 
about the structure and properties of the nucleons (for details, see below).

Investigating the Quantum Properties of Nucleons from a Wave View
17.1 
The Building Blocks of Nature: What is 
an Elementary Particle? 
17.1.1 
Elementary Particles versus Composite Particles 
In our universe, most matters are in the form of atoms, which are composed of elec-
trons and nucleons (protons and neutrons). In the old days, all sub-atomic particles are 
called “elementaryparticles”. Now, it is no longer true. In the study of particle physics 
using colliders, it was found that new particles can be created during the collision, 
and some particles can decay to other particles. These observations suggested that 
some of the sub-atomic particles can be composed of other particles. They should 
be called “composite particles”. Protons and neutrons are found to belong to this 
class. On the other hand, leptons, including electron, muon, tau, and neutrinos, are 
not composite particles. They remain to be classiﬁed as “elementary particles”. 
With the development of the Standard Model in the later part of the twentieth 
century, it became widely accepted that nucleons are composed of more elementary 
particles called “quarks”. Scientists now believe that there are six different quarks 
which can be grouped into 3 generations (up/down, strange/charm, top/bottom). 
Furthermore, each quark can have three different “colors” (red, green, and blue). 
This so-called “color” here is not a real color, but a hidden degree of freedom for the 
quarks. Each quark also has its own anti-particle. All together, we have 36 quarks. 
Besides protons and neutrons, many new particles were found to be composed of 
quarks. Particles formed by 3 quarks are called “baryons”, while particles formed 
by 2 quarks are called “mesons”. Together they are called “hadrons”. 
From now on, we will call all sub-atomic particles found in nature as “quantum 
particles”. These quantum particles are classiﬁed into two categories: (1) Elementary 
particles, which includeleptons andgaugebosons (such as photon), as well asquarks. 
(2) Composite particles, which include mainly hadrons (see Fig. 17.1). 
In the Standard Model of particle physics today, “elementary particles” can be sub-
divided into “fermions” and “bosons”. Fermions are the building blocks of matters, 
which can be sub-divided into leptons and hadrons, while bosons are thought to be 
mediators of forces. For example, photons are the mediator of electromagnetic force,
Fig. 17.1 Classiﬁcation of 
elementary particles. 
Elementary particles can be 
classiﬁed into free particles 
and bound particles. Gauge 
bosons, leptons, and quarks 
are elementary particles; 
hadrons are composite 
particles made up of quarks 

17.2 Long-Range Force versus Short-Range Forces in the Vacuum Medium
239
Z and W± are mediators of the weak nuclear force, while gluons are the mediators 
of the strong nuclear force (see Fig. 16.1 in the last chapter). 
17.1.2 
Free Particles versus Bound Particles 
In our physical world, not all elementary particles are free particles, and not all 
free particles are elementary particles. For particles that we have discussed so far, 
like electrons and photons, they are elementary particles, and they can travel in the 
space freely. Other elementary particles, such as quarks, cannot travel freely; they 
can only be conﬁned with other quarks to form a complex structure. They are not 
free particles. Some sub-atomic particles, such as protons and neutrons, on the other 
hand, can travel freely by themselves. But they are not elementary particles. They 
are “composite particles”. 
So, the elementary particles can be sub-divided into “free elementary particles” 
and “bound elementary particles”. In the quantum wave model discussed in this 
book, it is proposed that all free elementary particles (such as photons and electrons) 
are quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium, which are driven by the long-
range force. We will further hypothesize that the bound elementary particles (quarks) 
and their composite particles (hadrons) are also excitation waves of the same vacuum 
medium, but they are driven by the short-range forces. Using our terminology, they 
are all “waveticles”! 
Why do we think hadrons are wave? This hypothesis is based on the following 
reasons. First, if the hadron is not a wave, one cannot explain why it can be created 
in the vacuum or annihilated into nowhere. Second, we know most hadrons are not 
stable; they can decay to give leptons and photons. This decaying process suggests 
that hadrons are also excitation waves of the vacuum. 
17.2 
Long-Range Force versus Short-Range Forces 
in the Vacuum Medium 
In our model, there is one major difference between the leptons and the hadrons. We 
know there are four different types of forces in nature, the electromagnetic force, 
the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, and gravity. The electromagnetic 
force is long-range, while the strong and weak nuclear forces are short-range (in the 
order of 10–15 m or less). In nature, a force must be transmitted through a medium. 
So, what are the media for transmitting the long-range and short-range forces? We 
know the vacuum is a mediator for the electromagnetic force. It is very likely that 
the same vacuum is the mediators also for the strong and weak forces. Otherwise 
the space of our Universe must be ﬁlled with multiple media, which would make 
the nature far more complicated. In the quantum wave model, we proposed that the

Investigating the Quantum Properties of Nucleons from a Wave View
free elementary particles (such as photons and electrons) are quantized excitation 
wave of the vacuum medium driven by the long-range force. That is why the 
quantum wave equation of electron can be derived from the Maxwell theory. For 
the bound elementary particles (quarks), they are excitation waves driven by the 
short-range nuclear forces (see Table 17.1). At this time, it is not yet known how 
to model the action of short-range forces on the vacuum medium. That requires a 
set of equations different than Maxwell equations. We know very little about it. This 
will be the work of the future. 
In summary, there could be two different types of excitation waves transmitted 
through the vacuum: The ﬁrst type is driven by the long-range force; photons, 
scalar particles, electrons, and other leptons all belong to this type. They appear as free 
elementary particles. The second type is mainly driven by the short-range forces. 
It includes all quarks; they appear as bound elementary particles. Interestingly, since 
the free elementary particles are driven by the long-range force, their wavelength is 
usually very long (say, from Å to meters). Conversely, since the bound elementary 
particles (quarks) are driven by the short-range forces, their wavelength usually is 
very short (estimated to be far less than 10–15 m, the size of a nucleus). For the 
composite particles such as the hadrons, they can be in a bound state (inside a 
nucleus) or in a free state (outside of a nucleus). They may be driven by both the 
short-range and long-range forces within the vacuum.

17.3 Internal Structure of Nucleons and the Atomic Nucleus
241
17.3 
Internal Structure of Nucleons and the Atomic 
Nucleus 
17.3.1 
Current Understanding Based on the Particle View 
Hadrons are believed to be composed of quarks. For example, a proton is thought to 
be composed of two up quarks (each with electric charge 2/3 e) and one down quark 
(with −1/3 e) (see Fig.  17.2). Each of these quarks is supposed to have a different 
“color”, so that the combined “color” of the hadron is zero (i.e., “white”). 
The quarks within the proton are supposed to be held together by the short-range 
nuclear force called “strong interaction”. In the Standard Model, this strong inter-
action is mediated by a massless gauge boson called “gluon”. Gluon is considered 
to be a quantum particle associated with the “color” force between quarks [1]. It is 
thought that gluons couple to the color charges of the quarks according to the theory 
of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). 
Quarks only account for a small amount of mass. Most of the hadron mass is 
contributed by the binding energy through gluons. For example, a proton is thought 
to be made up of twoup quarks and onedown quark. The resting energies of the quarks 
only account for a small fraction of the rest mass of the proton (see Table 17.2). The 
majority of the proton rest mass is thought to be contributed by the binding energies.
Starting from the early days of nuclear physics, it has been believed that the atomic 
nucleus is made up of individual protons and neutrons. These nucleons are thought to 
be held together by the strong nuclear force. Since gluon is the only known mediator 
of the strong force, it would imply that protons and neutrons are held together in the 
nucleus by gluons. The detailed mechanism, however, is not yet clear. 
Hadrons in general are not stable. With the exception of proton, all “free” hadrons 
(not bound within an atomic nucleus) are unstable. They will eventually decay into 
other particles. Proton is the only hadron that is stable either in a free state or bound 
within an atomic nucleus. Neutron, by comparison, is stable only inside the atomic

to be composed of two up

17.3.2 
Speculation from the Wave View 
According to the Standard Model, hadrons are composite particles composed of 
quarks. In the wave view, quarks are also excitation wave of the vacuum. But unlike 
the free elementary particle (such as the electron), the quark is a bound particle which 
does not travel freely in space. It is supposed to be trapped inside a small space within 
a hadron. In our model, we proposed that the vacuum can have two different types 
of waves. The ﬁrst type is a propagating wave. The second type is a localized wave, 
like a vortex. The free particle such as an electron is a waveticle like the ﬁrst type. 
The quark is a waveticle more like the second type. As an analogy, we can think 
of the second type of wave (localized wave) as a vortex-like structure (e.g., water 
whirlpool, tornado or hurricane) (see Fig. 17.3). In fact, the idea of vortex had been 
used to model a wide variety of physical objects, from the tiny Majorana fermion to 
the huge structure of a galaxy [4, 5]. In our view, the quantum wave function of the 
quarks should represent a displacement of the vacuum medium, just like the other 
elementary particles (waveticles).
Since the nucleon is made up of multiple quarks, a nucleon at rest would look like 
a complex wave structure composed of multiple vortex-like quarks (see Fig. 17.4). 
But unlike an individual quark, the composite particle (such as a proton or neutron) 
can travel freely in space with high speed. It is a free waveticle.
How can the quarks be held together inside a hadron? In the Standard Model, they 
are held together by the exchange of gluons. In our wave model, it is not clear whether 
gluons really exist or not. We know the strong force is responsible for holding the 
quarks together. But how this works is still unclear. In fact, there is no direct evidence 
showing the existence of gluon, since the gluon cannot be isolated from the hadron. 
The conﬁrmation of the gluon concept can only rely on indirect evidence.

vacuum. Vortex models are commonly used to model a wide range of physical systems, from 
a very microscopic Majorana fermion to b the very macroscopic galaxy formation. In this work, we 
propose that the bound elementary particle (quark) can also be modeled as a vortex. Image Credit:

17.3.3 
Could the Atomic Nucleus be an Aggregation 
of Quarks Instead of an Aggregation of Nucleons? 
In the traditional view, the atomic nucleus is thought to be an aggregation of nucleons 
(protons and neutrons) (see Fig. 17.5a). But this may not be the true picture. Since 
nucleons are supposed to be held together by the force of strong interaction, and 
so are the quarks within an individual nucleon, there may not be a clear boundary 
between neighboring nucleons. Quarks belonging to different nucleons could interact 
just like quarks within the same nucleon. If this is the case, the entire atomic nucleus 
is just an aggregation of interacting quarks, instead of a cluster of individual protons 
and neutrons.
Take the helium nucleus as an example. It is not necessary to be a composite of 
two individual protons and two neutrons. It can be a “cage” containing 12 quarks (6u 
and 6d); these quarks are moving rapidly inside it (see Fig. 17.5b). In other words, 
the atomic nucleus is just an aggregation of entangled quarks; there is no individual

nucleus. b One may regard the helium nucleus as an aggregation of entangled quarks
proton or neutron inside it. The proton and neutron may appear as individual particles 
only when they are ejected outside of the nucleus. 
From such a view, there is no conceptual difference between the nucleus of helium 
atom and the nucleus of hydrogen atom (i.e., a proton). They are all composite 
particles of quarks. This can also be true for nuclei of higher atomic numbers. This 
means that a nucleus can be generally regarded as a composite particle. Indeed, 
for radioactive isotopes emitting alpha particles, the radiation particle is identical to 
the nucleus of the helium atom. 
Thus, we can expect that a nucleus under motion will have similar wave properties 
as a hadron. This expectation is indeed conﬁrmed in experiments. Diffraction exper-
iments using particle beams had indicated that, like protons and neutrons, the nuclei 
of helium were also found to behave as waves and follow the de Broglie relation 
[6, 7]. 
17.4 
Outstanding Questions in Particle Physics 
17.4.1 
What Hold Nucleons Together in a Nucleus? 
Most nuclear physicists today agree that nucleons inside an atomic nucleus are held 
together by the strong force. So how to explain the strong force in the nucleus? In 
the 1930s, a Japanese physicist named Hideki Yukawa (see Fig. 17.6) proposed a 
model to describe the strong force. He hypothesized that the strong force between 
protons and neutrons is expressed through the exchange of an intermediary particle. 
This idea could be inspired by the implication of the quantum ﬁeld theory of electron 
at that time. After the establishment of Dirac’s electron theory, the quantum ﬁeld 
theory (called “quantum electrodynamics”) was soon developed. In this theory, the 
interaction between electrons can be explained by the creation and annihilation of

17.4 Outstanding Questions in Particle Physics
245
photons. This was interpreted as the start of a new idea that “the interaction between 
electrons is through the exchange of photons”. 
In Yukawa’s model, he proposed that the intermediary particle responsible for the 
nucleon-nucleon interaction is a kind of “meson” (mediating particle) [8]. According 
to the distance that the strong force can exist, he estimated that the mass of this meson 
is about hundreds of times that of an electron, and much smaller than that of a proton. 
At that time, no such particles were found. In 1936, a new particle called “muon” 
was discovered from the observation of cosmic rays [9]. The mass of the muon 
(~100 meV) is about 200 times the mass of the electron. Since the muon mass is 
between the mass of an electron and a proton, it ﬁts Yukawa’s prediction. People at 
that time thought that this muon was the meson predicted in the Yukawa’s model. 
Later experiments, however, found that the muon is a lepton and does not partici-
pate in the strong interaction; it cannot be the “meson” predicted in Yukawa’s model 
[10]. 
After World War II, the energy of accelerators became larger and larger, and more 
and more new particles were discovered. A new particle called “pion” was discovered 
in 1947 by C F Powell and his colleagues [11]. Its mass is larger than that of muons 
(~140 meV), and its properties are more in line with the predictions of Yukawa’s 
model. So, people thought that the pion is the “meson” predicted in Yukawa’s model 
[10]. Yukawa was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1949; Powell also won the Nobel Prize 
in 1950. 
Ironically, people later discovered that the pion is actually a hadron composed of 
two quarks, it is not a particle for mediating force. Therefore, the earlier identiﬁcation 
of the pion being the transmitter of the strong force between nucleons was just another 
misunderstanding.

the 1930s, Yukawa proposed a model to explain the strong force; namely, the nucleons are held 
together by exchanging a force mediating particle called “meson”. The idea that force is transmitted 
by particles had a great impact on the development of particle physics. His model won him a Nobel 
Prize in Physics in 1949. Photo Credit: General Atomic Division of General Dynamics Corporation

Later, Murray Gell-Mann and others developed the quark model, which proposed 
that the strong force is transmitted through a gauge boson called “gluon” [12]. This 
quark theory is now generally accepted. However, although Yukawa’s strong force 
model was proven to be incorrect, the view that “forces are mediated through 
the exchange of intermediary particles” has become a mainstream idea in particle 
physics. 
17.4.2 
Could Quarks be Composed by Even More 
Elementary Objects? Could the Concept of Particle Go 
Away at Higher Energy? 
In the last century, physicists have made tremendous progress in understanding the 
way how nature works. The Standard Model of particle physics is no doubt one of 
the triumphal achievements in the study of physics. However, the subject of under-
standing nature in the most microscopic scale is an exceedingly difﬁcult challenge. 
The Standard Model was developed mainly half a century ago. In comparing the 
human history of studying nature, half a century is a very short time. So, it is not 
surprising that we are still far from getting the last answer of how nature works. No 
matter how good or how reasonable the model we are building today, it still requires 
many experimental tests and theoretical reﬁnements. 
Take the Standard Model of elementary particle for example. How good is it now? 
According to one of the leaders in this ﬁeld, Steven Weinberg (see Fig. 17.7), we are 
still very far from getting the ﬁnal theory. For example, in one of Weinberg’s paper 
entitled “What is An Elementary Particle?”, he said: “I would have to admit that no 
one really knows” [13]. According to Weinberg: 
From this point of view, we are entitled only to say that the quarks and gluons are more 
elementary than nucleons and pions, because their ﬁelds appear in a theory, the Standard 
Model, that applies over a much wider range of energies than the effective ﬁeld theory that 
describes nucleons and pions at low energy. We cannot reach any ﬁnal conclusion about the 
elementarity of the quarks and gluons themselves. The Standard Model itself is probably 
only an effective quantum ﬁeld theory, which serves as an approximation to some more 
fundamental theory whose details would be revealed at energies much higher than those 
available in modern accelerators, and which may not involve quark, lepton, or gauge ﬁelds 
at all [13].
About whether quark could be composite of more elementary particles, Wein-
berg thought that is highly likely: “The fact that we see no structure in the quarks 
and leptons only tells us that the energies involved in their binding must be quite 
large—larger than several trillion electron volts. But so far no one has worked out 
a convincing theory of this sort” [13]. 
Many physicists are now wondering whether the Standard Model of particle 
physics today is going to be replaced by a more complete theory in the future. At this

point, the so-called “elementary particles” may not be elementary at all. According 
to Weinberg: 
We will not be able to give a ﬁnal answer to the question of which particles are elementary 
until we have a ﬁnal theory of force and matter. When we have such a theory, we may ﬁnd 
that the elementary structures of physics are not particles at all. Many theorists think that 
the fundamental theory is something like a superstring theory, in which quarks, leptons, etc. 
are just different modes of vibration of the strings [13]. 
17.4.3 
Could the Problem be Solved by the String Theory? 
In order to go beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and to solve the well-
known problem that the quantum theory is incompatible with general relativity, some 
physicists started to develop a new theory called “string theory” about half a century 
ago. The string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles in 
the Standard Model are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. Instead of 
treating sub-atomic particles as the fundamental building blocks of matter, the string 
theory proposed that everything is made of extremely tiny strings, whose vibrations 
produce effects that we interpret as atoms, electrons, and quarks. 
At the early stage, the String theory was promoted in a very high-proﬁle manner. 
It was called the “theory of everything” [14]. That is, it is a single mathematical 
framework capable of describing the entirety of the known universe. 
In order for that to work, string theory has to make several radical assumptions 
[14]. For example, it hypothesized that we must be living in a world with 10–11 
dimensions. Some versions of the theory would require even higher number of dimen-
sions of space–time. Furthermore, it assumes that these extra dimensions are curled 
up so tightly so that we will not notice them in the ordinary life. 
The string theory was highly popular among some of the particle physicists and 
cosmologists during the past 30 years. Its popularity has subsided more recently due 
to two reasons. First, so far, it has failed to make any substantial predictions that

248
17
Investigating the Quantum Properties of Nucleons from a Wave View
could supply a breakthrough on the current theory. Second, it is exceedingly difﬁcult 
or even impossible to design experiment to test the predictions of this theory. 
To construct models of particle physics based on string theory, physicists typically 
begin by specifying a shape for the extra dimensions of space–time. Each of these 
different shapes corresponds to a different possible universe, or “vacuum state”, with 
a different collection of particles and forces. The current version of string theory has 
an enormous number of vacuum states, estimated to be around 10500 [15]. Although 
this could be an advantage for using the string theory to model a multiverse theory, 
it is sufﬁciently diverse to accommodate almost any phenomenon. Many physicists 
regard this proﬂigacy as string theory‘s fatal ﬂaw. If a theory makes so many different, 
contradictory predictions, then almost any set of observations could be found to 
conﬁrm it. In other words, that makes it almost impossible to falsify the theory. 
Many critics of string theory have expressed concerns about the large number of 
possible universes described by the string theory [15–17]. For example, in a recent 
book entitled “Not Even Wrong”, it was argued that the large number of different 
physical scenarios will make the string theory useless as a framework for constructing 
models of particle physics [15]. 
17.5 
The Mass of a Composite Particle 
In Chap. 11, we proposed that the origin of mass in a free particle (such as an electron) 
is associated with a transverse wave number. For the mass of a composite particle, 
it is much more complicated. This is because the internal structure of a composite 
particle is not clearly known. 
At present, it is not possible to write down a simple quantum wave equation for 
hadrons. But this may not prevent us to get some ideas on their basic properties. 
Based on experimental observations and from general analogies between free parti-
cles (simple and composite), we can still obtain some basic information about the 
relationship between energy, momentum, and mass for the composite particles. The 
most important thing is that, like the free elementary particles, composite particles 
also behave like waves. As we showed earlier, electrons can be diffracted from a 
crystal following the Bragg diffraction law [18]. It was found later that neutrons and 
protons can also be diffracted in a similar manner [6, 7]. This implies that composite 
particles also have wave properties like the electron and they follow the de Broglie 
relation too. 
This similarly allows us to speculate that the energy–momentum relation for a 
composite particle is similar to that of a free elementary particle. In Chap. 11, we  
already showed that, for a free particle such as an electron, the resting energy and 
moving energy of a single particle appear to form a two-dimensional Hilbert space. 
The total energy of the particle is the vector sum of these two energies. We propose 
that the same is true for a composite particle. That is, Eq. (11.29) of Chap. 11 is also 
applicable for the composite particles,

17.5 The Mass of a Composite Particle
249
upper E squared equals c squared p squared plus upper E 0 squared period 
Here, uper E 0 is the zero-point energy of the composite particle, which is the amount of 
energy possessed by the particle when there is no translational motion. What is the 
source of the resting energy? A natural expectation is that it must be contributed by 
the intrinsic energy of individual quarks and their binding energies. 
Once we know the relation between energy and momentum, we can derive the 
relationship between energy and mass. This can be done by differentiating Eq. (17.1) 
versus p, 
2 upper E StartFraction d upper E Over d p EndFraction equals 2 c squared p
2 u p er E  StartFraction d upper E Over d p EndFraction equals 2 c squared p
Since the particle is a wave packet, d upper E slas h d p equals d omega slash d k equals v. Recall that p = mv, 
the above equation becomes 
uppe r E equals m c squared period 
At v = 0, p  = 0, then 
upper E 0 equals m 0 c squared period 
Thus, no matter whether a free particle is a simple particle or a composite particle, 
one can always deﬁne a rest mass which is directly related to the resting energy. And, 
by substituting Eq. (17.3) into Eq. (17.1), we can obtain the “relativistic” energy– 
momentum relation for a composite particle, 
upper E squared equals c squared p squared plus m 0 squared c Superscript 4 Baseline period 
Using Eq. (17.2) and p = mv, this can further give 
m e
quals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period 
√
m equals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction period 
By comparing Eqs. (17.2)–(17.5) with Eqs. (11.24)–(11.27) in Chap. 11, it is clear 
that the relations between E, p, and m are the same for both free elementary particles 
and composite particles. 
17.5.1 
Origin of Rest Mass for a Composite Particle 
The origin of the rest mass is different between a free elementary particle and a 
composite particle. As we had discussed in the earlier chapters, for the free particle

250
17
Investigating the Quantum Properties of Nucleons from a Wave View
(such as an electron), the rest mass is associated with a transverse wave number script l. 
For the composite particles (such as a proton or neutron), the rest mass is apparently 
associated with the internal energy of the constituents which make up the composite 
particle. For example, a proton is thought to be made up of two up quarks and one 
down quark. Each of these quarks is an elementary particle; it has its own resting 
energy (rest mass). But in addition to that, there are also binding energies between 
quarks. These energies are associated with the strong force needed to hold the quarks 
together. In fact, the resting energies of the quarks only account for a small fraction 
of the rest mass of the proton (see Table 17.2). The majority of the proton rest mass 
appears to be contributed by the binding energies. 
Finally, one may ask: What is the relation between E, p, and m for the atomic 
nucleus? We know the nucleus of the hydrogen atom is made up of a single proton. 
This suggests that there can be some sort of similarity between a nucleus and a 
hadron. Indeed, as we discussed in the earlier part of this chapter, the atomic nucleus 
can be regarded as an aggregation of interacting quarks instead of a cluster of protons 
and neutrons (see Fig. 17.5b). In another word, the nucleus can be thought of as a 
soup of quarks. 
Thus, we can expect that a free nucleus could have similar wave properties as a 
hadron. This suggests that Eqs. (17.1)–(17.5) are applicable also to the nucleus of an 
atom. The relationships between energy, momentum, and mass are no different 
between an atomic nucleus and a hadron particle. Then, we can conclude that, 
for free particles of different kinds, including elementary particles like photons and 
electrons, and composite particles like protons and atomic nuclei, they all follow the 
same energy–momentum relation, i.e., 
upper E squared equals c squared p squared plus upper E 0 squared period 
In our model, all types of free particles are waveticles; they have similar energy– 
momentum relations, which appear as parallel lines in the E2 versus p2 plot (see 
Fig. 17.8). The only difference between particles is that their intersects with the 
vertical axis are not the same. That means, the resting energy uper E 0 for different particles 
is different. Since the resting energy is directly related to the rest mass by upper E 0 equals m 0 c squared 
, 
this reﬂects that the rest mass is different for different kinds of free particle.
The predictions shown in Fig. 17.8 are fully consistent with observations in exper-
iments conducted so far. The fact that the slope of the energy–momentum relation is 
the same for all particles (slope = c2) suggests that both the “simple particles” (i.e., 
free elementary particles) and the composite particles are excitation waves of the 
same medium. We know the propagation speed of a wave is determined by the phys-
ical properties of the wave medium. It can be shown easily that the ultimate speed 
of a waveticle is determined by the slope of the E2 versus p2 plot. Since the slope 
of photons is the same as that of electrons and hadrons, there is no basic difference 
between the radiation wave and the matter wave. They are just different excitation 
modes of the vacuum medium! Thus, the results plotted in Fig. 17.8 are consistent 
with the basic assumption of the quantum wave model that all free particles in our 
universe are excitation waves of the same quantum vacuum.

Chapter Summary
• According to the quantum wave model, free particles are excitation waves of the 
quantum vacuum (here we call them “waveticles”). There are two different types 
of waveticles: The ﬁrst type is driven by the long-range force; photons, scalar 
particles, electrons, and other leptons all belong to this type. The second type is 
driven by short-range forces. It includes all quarks and hadrons.
• The electromagnetic force is the long-range force. The short-range forces include 
the strong interaction and the weak interaction.
• The ﬁrst type of quantum particles, such as photons, electrons, and other leptons, 
are stand-alone elementary particles with no internal sub-component. They can 
travel freely in space.
• Quarks are elementary particles of the second type. They are bound particles and 
cannot travel freely in space.
• Hadrons, including protons and neutrons, are not elementary particles. Instead, 
they arecompositeparticles made up of quarks. Except for proton, these composite 
particles are unstable outside of the nucleus.
• Is the Standard Model the ﬁnal theory? Many leading physicists suspect that it is 
the approximation of a more fundamental theory.
• One could think of the atomic nucleus as a large composite particle; it is just an  
aggregation of interacting quarks, instead of a cluster of individual protons and 
neutrons.
• The energy–momentum relation for a composite particle is similar to that of a 
free elementary particle.

Exploration in Cosmology 
from the Quantum Wave View: Is There 
a Beginning or an End to Our Universe? 
The quantum wave model discussed in this book is not a theory of everything! It is  
mainly used for explaining the physical phenomena in the quantum world. However, 
it can also give some useful hints to explain what we observed in the cosmos, for 
example, the origin of dark matter (see below). 
Cosmology is undoubtedly a very important ﬁeld of study. From the early days in 
human history, people have already wondered what our world is made of. Modern 
cosmology is a very young ﬁeld; many powerful observational tools, such as high-
resolution telescopes and satellites, only emerged in the last century. As a result, 
people have very limited time to build the fundamental theory. Many current models 
are based on conjectures from research in particle physics or general relativity. 
Naturally, modern cosmological theories are dominated by the views of particle 
physicists. As we pointed out in earlier chapters of this book, the particle view has 
certain limitations. For future cosmological research, it may be helpful to explore 
new ideas based on alternative approaches, such as the idea of the quantum wave 
model. This chapter is an exploration of such an approach. 
The Standard Model of cosmology today is far from the ﬁnal theory. There are still 
many challenges that need to be addressed. Therefore, future cosmology researchers 
should have plenty of opportunities. The most mysterious things in cosmology at 
present are dark matter and dark energy. No one knows what they are. So, it might 
be interesting to see if the quantum wave model can shed light on this problem. 
At the end of this chapter, we will also discuss brieﬂy a very important question: 
Is there a beginning or an end to our universe?

18.1 What is Dark Matter Made of? The View 
of the Quantum Wave Model 
In recent study of cosmology, it was discovered that our universe is not only composed 
of visible matters, but also dark matters and dark energy [1, 2]. The name “dark 
matter” implies that it is invisible. This is because dark matter is transparent to 
electromagnetic radiation and thus cannot be detected using current imaging tech-
nologies. Its existence is indirectly inferred mainly from its gravitational effects on 
the universe‘s large-scale structure, such as the rotational motions of stars around 
galaxies and gravitational lensing [3, 4]. 
The primary evidence for dark matter was from calculations showing that many 
galaxies would behave quite differently if they did not contain a large amount of 
unseen matter. The ﬁrst proposal of “dark matter” is often attributed to Fritz Zwicky’s 
work in the 1930s [5, 6]. Based on the study of the Coma Cluster, Zwicky obtained 
evidence of unseen mass (“dark matter”). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the 
motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its 
brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated the cluster had far more mass than 
was visually observable. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, further evidence was obtained using galaxy rotation 
curves based on measurements of the velocity curve of spiral galaxies; Rubin and 
Ford showed most galaxies must contain about six times dark matter in additional to 
visible mass [7]. 
Later, radio astronomers also made use of new radio telescopes to map the 21 cm 
line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of interstellar 
atomic hydrogen often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible 
by optical studies, extending the sampling of rotation curves [8]. Results of these 
measurements also suggested very large values of mass-to-light ratio in the outer 
parts of the galaxy (see Fig. 18.1).
How to explain such strange phenomena became an important topic in cosmology 
in the 1980s. Cosmologists called this invisible matter “dark matter”. The Standard 
Model of cosmology at present indicates that the total mass/energy of the universe 
contains about 5% ordinary matter, 26% dark matter, and 69% dark energy [1, 2]. So, 
the amount of dark matter is about ﬁve times of that of visible matter. At this point, 
very little is known about the nature of dark matter. There are two major questions 
waiting to be answered: (1) What is dark matter composed of? Is it composed of 
particles? What could these particles be? (2) Why are there more dark matters than 
visible matters? 
The early proposed dark matter candidates include neutrinos and exotic particles 
in high-energy particle physics [9]. Other suggested candidates include axions and 
supersymmetric particles such as photinos (the supersymmetric partner of photon) 
[10], and massive compact halo objects such as black holes [11]. 
At present, the leading hypothesis about dark matter is that it is composed of 
weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) which interact only through gravity 
and the weak nuclear force [12]. These WIMPs are supposed to be new particles in the

Fig. 18.1 Rotation curve of spiral galaxy Messier 33. The observed rotation curve of spiral 
galaxy Messier 33 is represented by the yellow and blue points, and the predicted rotation curve 
from distribution of the visible matter is shown as the dashed line. The discrepancy between the two 
curves can be accounted for by adding a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy. (For details, see

100 GeV mass range. So far, none of the experiments designed to detect WIMPs has 
produced any evidence for their existence [11, 13–15]. Currently, there are several 
ongoing projects attempting to detect the WIMPs either directly or indirectly [16, 17]. 
We think the quantum wave model discussed in this book may provide a basis 
for searching new sources of dark matter. According to our model, all particles 
in nature are excitation waves of the vacuum (here we call them “waveticles”). 
Some of these excitation waves could behave as dark matter. These waveticles do 
not interact easily with other particles because they have certain speciﬁc properties, 
such as: 
• Having no electric charge. The dark matter (DM) particles have no electric 
charge. Thus, they do not interact with other charged particles through electro-
magnetic interactions. That means these DM particles will not interact with the 
electrons or nucleus of any atom. Also, because they have no electric charge, 
the DM particles will not interact with electromagnetic radiation, including light. 
Thus, they will look dark. 
• Having no color charge, i.e., not being composite particles. These DM particles 
are unlikely to be hadrons. Since hadrons are made of quarks, any hadron can 
interact strongly with the atomic nuclei when it passes through an ordinary object. 
For example, neutron is a hadron without electric charge. It does not behave like 
dark matter because it can interact easily with the atomic nuclei of visible matters. 
• With small cross section. For the dark matter not to interact with visible matter, 
its interaction cross section with particles of ordinary matters must be very small. 
That means, the DM particle may behave like neutrino, which has very small 
interaction cross section.

256

• Possessing very short wavelength. Why the dark matter is dark? That is because 
we cannot see it. But what is seeing? It involves either absorption or scattering 
of the particle by the atoms. Take the photons for example. We see light because 
EM wave can interact with the orbital electrons of the atoms in our retina (or in a 
light sensor). For light to be absorbed by an orbital electron, it requires a matching 
of the particle energy (up p er E equals italic h over two pi omega) with the electron transition energy (the energy 
difference between the initial state and the ﬁnal state of the electron, normal upper Delta upper E Subscript electron). 
In another word, absorption or emission of light requires ital ic h over two pi omega almost equals normal upper Delta upper E Subscript electron. For  
most condensed matters, the energy level of an orbital electron (or electron bands) 
is in the order of several electron volts. If the energy of the incoming particle is 
much larger than the electron energy, the chance of absorption is extremely small. 
The particle will just pass by without interacting with the atom. This is why X-ray 
is more transparent to matter than visible light. If the DM particles have a very 
short wavelength, it will not interact easily with the orbital electrons of an atom 
or the band electrons of a solid. It thus would appear as “dark”. 
The properties listed above are not unusual. It is reasonable to expect that many 
excitation waves in the vacuum can satisfy the above requirements. Thus, the 
number of particles meeting these criteria could be very large. We did not notice 
them before because we cannot observe them. Also, since these DM particles have 
no charge, they cannot form atoms. And thus, they cannot aggregate together to form 
bulb objects. 
Our model can also shed some light on the second question: How can there be 
more dark matters than visible matters? According to the quantum wave model, 
all particles are excitation waves of the vacuum medium. Each particle represents a 
different excitation mode. Since there can be many different excitation modes, the 
number of possible particle types in nature can be very large. Some of them may 
satisfy the required properties listed above. So, the number of candidates for dark 
matter could be quite large according to the wave view. 
Furthermore, since particles are excitation waves of the vacuum, they normally do 
not interact with each other. Take the sound waves for example. Each sound can be 
transmitted independently without interference by other sounds. Imagine that when 
we talk with a friend in a noisy marketplace, there are many different sounds. Yet, 
we can still hear the voice of our friend. Hence, according to the wave model, it is 
the norm that particles without electric charge or color charge do not interact with 
each other. They would appear as “dark”. 
Therefore, it is possible to use the quantum wave model to explain the origin of 
dark matter. A more difﬁcult challenge is “dark energy”. The Standard Model of 
cosmology at present assumes that our Universe is ﬁlled with dark energy, a totally 
unknown object. Why do scientists need to hypothesize its existence? As explained 
in the following, it is a concept originated from the development of the Big Bang 
model, which plays a major role in the modern studies of cosmology.

18.2 Is Our Universe Expanding? The Big Bang Model 
The Big Bang model is the prevailing cosmological theory that explains the origin 
and evolution of the universe. The theory is based on the observation made by Edwin 
Hubble in the 1920s that the universe is expanding. The Big Bang model suggests 
that the universe began as a single point of inﬁnite density and temperature (called a 
“singularity”). After that, the Universe has been expanding ever since. 
18.2.1 
Hubble’s Observation in 1929 
In 1929, Edwin Hubble reported the ﬁrst evidence for the expansion of our universe 
based on his study of 24 extra-galactic nebulae [18]. Using the largest telescope at the 
time (at Mount Wilson Observatory), Hubble noted that light from faraway galaxies 
appeared to be stretched to longer wavelengths, a phenomenon called redshift. He 
discovered that the more distant a nebula is from us, the faster it appears to move 
away (see Fig. 18.2). This implies that the universe is expanding uniformly in all 
directions. 
Hubble plotted the velocity-distance relation of these nebulae and calculated the 
slope (now called the “Hubble’s constant K”). He found that the value of the constant 
K from the 24 individual nebulae was about 500 km/sec per million parsecs. (The 
Hubble’s constant is often denoted as H0 in modern cosmology). Hubble‘s discovery 
suggested that our Universe is not static, as scientists had always believed; instead, 
our Universe is expanding.

18.2.2 
The Story of Einstein’s Cosmological Constant 
When Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, he thought that the 
universe was neither expanding nor contracting, in another word, the universe was 
static. In order to account for this, Einstein modiﬁed his theory of general relativity 
in 1917 by introducing a cosmological constant term into his equations. This cosmo-
logical constant represented a repulsive force that counteracted the gravitational 
attraction between matters, preventing the universe from collapsing under its own 
weight. 
When Edwin Hubble published his observation that distant galaxies were moving 
away from us at a speed proportional to their distance, scientists started to realize 
that the universe was expanding, and the idea of a static universe was abandoned. 
Physicists at that time were very excited about Hubble’s observation. Einstein even 
went to Mount Wilson to visit Hubble in 1931 and happily played with the telescope 
which led to Hubble’s discovery of the expanding universe. 
Hubble’s discovery made a big impression on Einstein. If our universe is not static, 
the cosmological constant Einstein added earlier to the general relativity equation to 
make the universe static is no longer needed. Einstein thus renounced the cosmolog-
ical constant, saying it is “a term which was not required by the theory as such, nor 
did it seem natural from a theoretical point of view” [19]. It was said that Einstein 
later wrote: “Since I introduced this term, I had always a bad conscience.... I am  
unable to believe that such an ugly thing is actually realized in nature” [20]. 
George Gamow recalled that Einstein regarded the introduction of the cosmolog-
ical constant to be the “biggest blunder” in his life [21]. It was a big surprise that 
Einstein’s “biggest blunder” would revive after more than half a century later. 
18.2.3 
The Rise of the Big Bang Model 
With the knowledge of the expansion of the universe, scientists proposed that, by 
extrapolating back in time, there should be a beginning of the universe. The early 
universe should be much denser and hotter. The Big Bang model suggests that the 
universe began as a singularity, which expanded rapidly, and the temperature dropped 
from almost an inﬁnite value to a few billion degrees. As the universe cooled, sub-
atomic particles began to form, and eventually, atoms formed. The formation of 
atoms allowed light to travel freely, and the universe became transparent [22]. 
The early proponents of the Big Bang model include Georges Lemaître and George 
Gamow. In 1931, Georges Lemaître published a short paper in Nature entitled “The 
Beginning of the World from the Point of View of Quantum Theory”. He wrote: “If 
we go back in the course of time we must ﬁnd fewer and fewer quanta, until we ﬁnd 
all the energy of the universe packed in a few or even in a unique quantum” [23].

18.2 Is Our Universe Expanding? The Big Bang Model
259
In the 1940s, Gamow, Alpher, and Herman proposed the existence of the relics 
of radiations from early hot universe. They used the Big Bang idea to explain how 
different elements formed [24]. They also calculated that the present relics of the 
early radiation should be around 5 K [25]. This was called the cosmic background 
radiation [26]. 
At that time, the competing model of the Big Bang is called “Steady State Model”. 
It believed that matters in the universe were created under rather constant rate (in a 
steady state), and there was no singularity (or a “Big Bang”) in the early universe. 
This model was championed by astronomer Fred Hoyle [27]. 
The debates between these two models lasted for several years. The Big Bang 
model was ﬁnally becoming the preferred choice of the cosmology community. This 
was mainly due to the observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation 
in 1964. The CMB was interpreted as relics of radiation from the early hot universe. 
It was regarded as strong evidence for the Big Bang model. 
18.2.4 
Cosmic Microwave Background: Evidence of the Big 
Bang Model 
In the past century, the most important experimental observation in cosmology is 
probably the measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), 
which was thought to be the leftover radiation from the Big Bang; it was emitted 
when the universe was only 380,000 years old. 
In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs built a large horn antenna 
to detect radio waves from the sky. However, they found some background noise at 
about 3 K which cannot be eliminated [28] (see Fig.  18.3). At the same time, a group 
of cosmologists led by Robert Dicke in Princeton University were actively trying to 
detect the cosmic background radiation but without success.
The Princeton team visited Penzias and Wilson to see their measurement and the 
large horn equipment. They were very excited and thought that the background noise 
Penzias and Wilson found was the cosmic background radiation leftover from the 
Big Bang of the Universe. But Penzias and Wilson were more cautious about the 
interpretation of their measurement. So, the two teams decided to publish their papers 
side by side in the Astrophysical Journal in the form of letters to the editor. Penzias 
and Wilson’s paper entitled “A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 
Megacycles per Second” simply reported the measurement of the background noise 
radiation [29]. In the Dicke’s group paper entitled “Cosmic Black-body Radiation”, 
they argued that the Big Bang theory implied the existence of cosmic microwave 
radiation following the black-body spectrum [22]. They suggested that the cosmic 
microwave background radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson was an important 
experimental support to the Big Bang theory [22]. 
Since the Big Bang theory had dominating inﬂuence in the cosmology community, 
Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978 for detecting

at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, was built in 1959 for pioneering work in 
communication satellites for the NASA ECHO I. The horn was later modiﬁed to work with the 
Telstar Communication Satellite frequencies as a receiver for broadcast signals from the satellite.

the microwave background noise from their antenna. [28]. Since then, the CMB has 
been extensively studied using satellites. The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) 
satellite was launched in 1989 to study the CMB in detail. COBE made precise 
measurements of the CMB, which conﬁrmed its uniformity and showed that the 
CMB does follow strictly the rule of black-body radiation (see Fig. 18.4). Their data 
also provided the ﬁrst evidence for tiny variations in its temperature. These variations 
are thought to be the seeds of the large-scale structure of the universe, such as galaxies 
and clusters of galaxies.
Later, other satellites such as the WilkinsonMicrowaveAnisotropyProbe (WMAP) 
and the Planck satellite have made more precise measurements of the CMB (see 
Fig. 18.5). These measurements generally conﬁrmed the predictions of the Big 
Bang model and allowed scientists to obtain detailed information about the age, 
composition, and structure of the universe. [1, 2]

18.3 Is Our Universe Expanding in an Accelerating Rate? 
The Idea of Dark Energy 
18.3.1 
Observations on Type Ia Supernova Suggested 
that the Universe is Expanding in an Accelerating 
Rate 
The most recent supporting evidence for the Big Bang theory is the discovery of 
accelerating expansion of the universe based on studies of Type Ia supernovae [30– 
32]. This type of supernova occurs in a binary star system where one star is a white 
dwarf. The white dwarf could accumulate matter from its companion star. When it 
eventually reaches a critical mass, it undergoes a catastrophic explosion, releasing 
an enormous amount of energy (see Fig. 18.6). 
Fig. 18.6 Type Ia supernovae. The heart of a vast cluster of galaxies called MACS J1720 + 35 is 
shown in this image, taken in visible and near-infrared light by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. 
The small white box at upper right marks the location of an exploding star called a supernova, located 
behind the cluster. An enlarged view of the supernova, catalogued as SCP/SN-L2, is shown in the 
inset image at top right, taken during July 2012. An arrow marks the location of the supernova, 
which resides near the bright core of the host galaxy. The supernova is seen as it appeared 7.7 
billion years ago. The inset image at top left, taken in March 2012, shows the same region before 
the supernova blast. This image underscores the transient nature of exploding stars. The supernova 
is a member of a special class of exploding star called Type Ia, prized by astronomers because it 
provides a consistent level of peak brightness that is useful for making distance estimates. Credit:

18.4 The Standard Model of Cosmology Today and Some of Its Current Debates
263
Since the Type Ia Supernova explosions are extremely bright and visible billions 
of light-years away, astronomers realized that they could be used as a “standard 
candle” for measuring distance. In the 1980s, the Supernova Cosmology Project, 
led by Saul Perlmutter at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, began searching 
for Type Ia supernovas. In the 1990s, the High-Z Supernova Search team, led by 
Brian Schmidt of the Australian National University and Adam Riess of the Space 
Telescope Science Institute, also joined the search. They expected to observe the 
deceleration of supernovas caused by the gravitational attraction of mass, according 
to Einstein’s gravitational theory. 
However, both teams soon found that the Type Ia supernovas they observed were 
fainter than expected from Hubble’s Law, suggesting that the universe was not decel-
erating but accelerating. Both teams quickly announced their ﬁndings. In January 
1998, the Supernova Cosmology Project announced at a press conference that they 
had analyzed 40 supernovas and found that the universe‘s expansion would continue 
forever, and that the data could be explained by a cosmological constant. In February, 
the High-Z team presented their supernova data at a conference, also showing that 
the expansion of the universe is accelerating and interpreted that the acceleration was 
driven by the energy of the vacuum which they thought was Einstein’s “cosmological 
constant”. 
Later that year, cosmologist Michael Turner coined the term “dark energy” to  
describe this mysterious repulsive force, in analogy with the invisible dark matter 
that makes up most of the matter in the universe. The ﬁnding of an accelerating 
expanding universe was surprising, yet it was soon accepted. In December 1998, 
Science magazine selected the discovery of accelerating expansion of the universe 
as the Breakthrough of the Year. 
18.4 The Standard Model of Cosmology Today and Some 
of Its Current Debates 
Today, the Standard Model of cosmology is known as the Lambda-Cold Dark 
Matter (ᴧCDM) model [11]. This model is based on Einstein’s theory of general 
relativity (GR). The term “Lambda (ᴧ)” stands for Einstein’s “cosmological 
constant”, a term which Einstein once considered the “biggest blunder” in his life. 
The Lambda-CDM model is a combination of the Big Bang model and the 
theory of cosmic inﬂation. It suggests that the universe began at a tiny point called 
“singularity”; the universe was in a state of inﬁnite density and extremely high 
temperature. At this point, the laws of physics as we know them do not hold. 
During the ﬁrst fraction of a second after the Big Bang, the universe underwent 
a period of rapid expansion known as inﬂation. During this period, the size of the 
universe increased by a factor of 1026 in 10–35 s [33]. After inﬂation, the universe 
continued to expand and cool, and energies were converted into particles. These early 
particles included quarks, which combined to form protons and neutrons. These

Fig. 18.7 Composition of matter and energy in our Universe according to the Lambda-CDM 
model. Estimate of the composition of our universe according to the Lambda-CDM model based 
on Planck’s high-precision cosmic microwave background map: Normal matter that makes up stars 
and galaxies contributes just 4.9% of the Universe‘s mass/energy inventory; dark matter, which 
is detected indirectly by its gravitational inﬂuence on nearby matter, occupies 26.8%, while dark 
energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the Universe, 
accounts for 68.3% 
particles then combined with electrons to form atoms, speciﬁcally hydrogen and 
helium. The formation of atoms marks the end of the “cosmic dark ages” and the 
beginning of the era of recombination, which occurred about 380,000 years after the 
Big Bang. 
From then on, the universe continued to expand and cool, and the ﬁrst stars and 
galaxies formed. The ﬁrst stars were likely massive and short-lived, exploding as 
supernovae and releasing heavy elements into the universe. These heavy elements 
provided the building blocks for the formation of subsequent generations of stars and 
planets. 
Using a six-parameter ﬁtting for the CMB data, the Lambda-CDM model suggests 
that the universe is currently composed of approximately 68% dark energy, 27% 
dark matter, and 5% normal matter [2] (see Fig.  18.7). Dark energy is believed to 
be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe, while dark matter is 
thought to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. 
18.4.1 
Some Current Debates on the Standard Model 
Despite the remarkable success of the Big Bang theory and the Lambda-CDM model 
in explaining astronomical observations, there are still many unanswered questions. 
For example, the nature of dark matter and dark energy remains a mystery. These 
phenomena require an extension of our current understanding of particle physics or 
suggest a breakdown of general relativity on cosmological scales [34]. 
Proposing the breakdown of physical laws at the early universe is also not a very 
attractive hypothesis. Thus, many leading investigators in cosmology had expressed

18.5 New Ideas for Cosmological Research from the Quantum Wave View
265
concerns on whether the current theory is examining nature from the right direction. 
For example, Michael Turner, who ﬁrst coined the term “dark energy”, suggested 
that the current questions about dark matter, dark energy, and inﬂation may not 
be the right ones to ask. It is possible that dark energy is a mirage, and the real 
explanation for cosmic acceleration could lie in a replacement for general relativity 
[35]. Inﬂation, in its current form, is another major challenge. Its loose ends, such 
as the prediction of multiverse (multiple universes), and its lack of a clear driving 
mechanism, may also make it out of touch with reality. 
One early proponent of theinﬂation model, Paul Steinhardt, criticized the Standard 
Model of cosmology in a 2005 paper [36]. He argued that many key questions remain 
unanswered, particularly, the anthropic principle advocated by some cosmologists is 
unreliable. Paul Steinhardt published another paper entitled “The Inﬂation Debate” 
in 2011, in which he argued that the original inﬂation theory was incorrect, and the 
current theory is difﬁcult to test experimentally. Steinhardt notes that bad inﬂation 
is more likely than good inﬂation, and obtaining a ﬂat universe without inﬂation is 
more likely than with inﬂation. He concludes that the inﬂation theory is problematic, 
and there is a need for alternative theories to explain the origins of the universe [37]. 
Another problem with the Standard Model is the discrepancy between the 
observed vacuum energy density and the energy required for driving the accelerated 
expansion of the Universe. As we discussed earlier, the studies of Type Ia supernovae 
led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe. In the Standard 
Model, this expansion was thought to be driven by dark energy. Vacuum energy is the 
leading candidate for dark energy, and it is mathematically equivalent to the cosmo-
logical constant “lambda” that Einstein introduced in 1917 [30, 34, 38]. According 
to some of the existing quantum theories, vacuum ﬂuctuations, or virtual particles 
created and annihilated in the vacuum, provide energy to the vacuum. However, theo-
retical calculations suggest that the energy density associated with these ﬂuctuations 
is at least 1055 times greater than the energy density measured by cosmologists [34, 
39]. If the vacuum energy density were truly that high, all matter in the universe 
would instantly ﬂy apart, and galaxies would never have formed. This discrepancy 
has been referred to as “the worst embarrassment in all of theoretical physics” [34]. 
18.5 New Ideas for Cosmological Research 
from the Quantum Wave View 
From the above discussion, one can see that there are many challenging questions 
for the current version of the Standard Model of cosmology. For example, 
• The Big Bang model is based on extrapolating what we observed in recent time 
to the very early time of the Universe. How reliable is this extrapolation? 
• At present, there are too many big mysteries in the Standard Model of cosmology. 
For example, we know nothing about the nature of dark energy or the mechanism 
of inﬂation.

266

Exploration in Cosmology from the Quantum Wave View: Is There …
• The Lambda-CDM model is based on the theory of general relativity (GR). 
However, there is a conceptual conﬂict between them. The GR assumes the 
vacuum is an empty space. But the Lambda-CDM model assumes that the vacuum 
is the ground state of a quantum system, which contains a tremendous amount of 
energy. How to reconcile between the two? 
Thus, there is a strong need to explore new ideas to resolve these mysteries. The 
quantum wave model discussed in this book could offer some help. This model 
examines nature in a different philosophical point of view in comparison with the 
traditional particle view. It can offer a new approach to understand our Universe. In 
the following, we will explore some new ideas for the future studies of cosmology. 
18.5.1 
Is There a Need to Re-Examine the Idea of Big Bang? 
We think there is a need to re-examine if our Universe is truly expanding or not. 
So far, the proposal of an expanding Universe was based mainly on observations of 
nearby galaxies moving away from us [18, 20]. From the quantum wave point of 
view, these observations do not directly imply that the Universe is expanding. 
First, according to the quantum wave model, matter is made of excitation waves 
of the vacuum. Thus, the movements of material objects, including hydrogen atoms, 
stars, nebula, or galaxies, are all movements of excitation waves. The movement of 
excitation waves does not mean a movement of the wave medium. Take the sound 
wave as an example, a sound wave propagating in the sea does not mean the sea water 
is moving in the same direction or speed as the sound wave. So, the observation of 
the material objects (galaxies) moving away from us does not imply that the vacuum 
is expanding. In the quantum wave model, the vacuum is a medium that ﬁlls the 
entire Universe. So, it is the vacuum that is directly connected to the Universe, not 
the excitation waves of the vacuum. Then, the observed movement of the material 
objects could not imply whether the Universe itself is expanding or not. 
Second, observations of distant galaxies moving away were made in nearby astro-
nomical regions. This means they are very local phenomena. We know the largest 
structure of our Universe is the cosmic web, in which billions and billions of galaxies 
are distributed in a non-uniform way (see Fig. 18.8). The structure of the cosmic web 
is expected to be dynamic; there are local movements and ﬂuctuation within it. Thus, 
there will be local stretching and contraction. It is not surprising for an observer 
within a local area to observe nearby objects moving away or moving inward. 
Since the observations of Hubble and the measurements of Type Ia supernovae both 
represent local events observed within the cosmic web, it is questionable whether 
these local observations can be extrapolated to the entire Universe.
Finally, there are technical issues on the reliability of the reported observations 
of galaxies moving away from us. For example, in the original study reported by 
Hubble, he did not have reliable “standard candles” to measure the distance of extra-
galactic nebulas. So, he just used some brightest stars in the nebula and assumed

their apparent luminosities had a maximum. He used them as a measure of distance. 
In fact, according to his original data, Hubble estimated that the age of the universe 
is only a few billion years, which is younger than our solar system. It does not make 
sense. Hubble also recognized that. He said that apparently one had to be careful 
when using the redshift to measure the age of the universe [18]. 
Then, what about the observations suggesting that our Universe is expanding in an 
accelerating rate? This ﬁnding was based on observations of the Type Ia supernova. 
In the circle of cosmology, Type Ia supernova was commonly used as a “standard 
candle” to calculate its distance from Earth. But these “candles” were found recently 
not to be so standard [40, 41]. For example, a recent study found evidence that super-
novae can arise by two different processes, which would give different brightness. 
This raised suspicion that standard candles are not so standard after all [41]. Another 
study examined the local environment of 28 Type Ia supernovae and found those with 
more elements heavier than helium (so-called “metals”) were dimmer than their less 
metallic counterparts [40]. Therefore, Type Ia supernova may not be a very reliable 
“standard candle”. Apparently, more extensive studies are needed to substantiate the 
earlier ﬁndings of accelerated expansion. 
18.5.2 
Is Extrapolation in Time Justiﬁed? 
Extrapolation in time is a dangerous game, it is not scientiﬁc. There is no assurance 
that one observed in the world for a short period will be applied for all times. Take 
the history of mankind for example. One cannot judge the trend of the stock market 
by extrapolation. One also cannot use extrapolation to judge the historical trend; it 
is well known that empires could rise and fall. In the case of cosmology, we do not 
yet know the mechanism behind the moving away of nearby galaxies at the present

268

time. Is it a perpetual effect or a temporary trend? Big Bang is certainly a bold idea; 
it will need very strong evidence to support it. 
So, unless we have overwhelming evidence that our Universe was created by a 
Big Bang, there is no need to hypothesize the existence of dark energy. Then, what 
about the recent claim that dark energy accounts for most of the matters/energy in 
our world? This was based on the analysis of CMB using the Lambda-CDM model. 
It is a model-dependent estimate. In science, one needs to carefully differentiate an 
estimate from a fact. 
18.5.3 
Should Time Be Continuous? 
Time should be continuous; there is no evidence that it has a beginning or an end. 
Hence, the idea of time having a beginning and an end is an artiﬁcial assumption, 
whoever suggested that will have the burden of proof. The current version of the 
Standard Model of cosmology has not yet produced overwhelming evidence for 
proving that time has a beginning or an end. 
According to the quantum wave model discussed in this book, all matters are 
quantized excitation waves of the vacuum. How long has the vacuum been there? 
Naturally, the vacuum should exist with our world from whatever time our world 
exists. Since the material objects in our world are excitation waves of the vacuum 
medium, they should have plenty of time to interact with each other. This would 
suggest that the material objects in our world should have been at some sort of 
thermal equilibrium a long time ago. 
This could explain why the distribution of matter in our present world is so homo-
geneous (in the large scale) and why the temperature of CMB appears to be so 
uniform. This problem is commonly referred to as the “horizon problem”. One of 
the major reasons for the proposal of the inﬂation theory is to solve the horizon 
problem. With the realization that time is continuous and the age of the vacuum in 
our Universe can be far longer than the model predicted by the Big Bang theory, the 
horizon problem is not a problem. Then, there is no need to propose the inﬂation 
theory. 
18.5.4 
What Could Be the Origin of CMB? 
From the above discussion, one can see that the Big Bang model is far from convinc-
ingly proven. There are still multiple challenges for it. One may raise the question 
of CMB. Had the studies of CMB already proven beyond doubt that the Big Bang 
model is correct? 
The presence of CMB was important evidence for supporting the Big Bang Model. 
However, we do not think this evidence is overwhelming. The major problem is that

18.5 New Ideas for Cosmological Research from the Quantum Wave View
269
no one knows exactly what the origin of CMB is. Can one prove that the CMB 
is indeed the relic of radiation from the Big Bang? Could one exclude the other 
alternative sources for the cosmic background radiation? 
For example, can one exclude the contribution of local thermal radiation from 
the observed CMB? We know in any thermal system, there should be background 
radiation within it. The space environment we live in, such as the solar system, can 
be regarded as a “thermal cavity” (see Fig. 18.9). Furthermore, our Sun is located 
at a spiral arm of the Milky Way; the aggregation of nearby stars in this spiral arm 
could also form a bigger “thermal cavity”. Thus, one can expect that there will be 
background radiation in the thermal cavity we live in. As we had discussed in Chaps. 2 
and 3, the electromagnetic radiation within a thermal cavity can be described by the 
formula of black-body radiation as worked out by Planck. In fact, based on the COBE 
satellite measurements, the CMB observed outside of the Earth ﬁts exactly with the 
prediction of black-body radiation. This may suggest that the cosmic background 
radiation observed by mankind could be originated from the thermal radiation in the 
local space environment near Earth. 
In order to test whether CMB originated from local thermal radiation or from 
the remnants of the Big Bang, we need to measure the CMB outside of the solar 
system, and preferably, outside of the Milky Way. If the CMB is indeed representing 
the remnants of the Big Bang, its distribution should appear the same regardless of
Fig. 18.9 Cavity of the solar system Heliosphere. The Sun’s stellar wind bubble, known as the 
heliosphere, is a region of space dominated by the Sun. Its boundaries are located at the termination 
shock, approximately 80–100 AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and approximately 
200 AU from the Sun downwind of the interstellar medium. Here, the solar wind collides with the 
interstellar medium, forming a huge elliptical structure called the heliosheath. The outer boundary 
of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is the point where the solar wind ﬁnally ends and interstellar 
space begins. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath at 
94 and 84 AU from the Sun, respectively. Image Credit Wimmer-Schweingruber, R.F., McNutt, R.,

18.6 Is There a Beginning or an End to Our Universe? The 
Model of an Endless Recycling Universe 
The study of the origins and the ultimate fate of the universe is a topic of great interest 
to scientists. At present, there is no clear evidence on whether there is a beginning or 
an end of our universe. The mainstream model of cosmology at present assumes that 
there is a beginning, i.e., the Big Bang, but it has no clue on whether there is an end. 
Depending on the different estimates of dark energy, many exotic end models of the 
universe had been suggested, including “Big Freeze” and “Big Crunch” [42, 43]. In 
the “Big Freeze” scenario, the universe will continue to expand forever, eventually 
becoming so spread out that all matter is too far apart to interact with each other, 
resulting in a cold, dark, and lifeless universe. In the “Big Crunch” scenario, the 
universe will stop expanding and then start to contract, eventually collapsing in on 
itself in a massive explosion. 
Another possibility is the “Big Bounce” model, which suggests that the universe 
goes through an inﬁnite number of cycles, with each cycle beginning with a Big Bang 
and ending with a Big Crunch. After the Big Crunch, a new universe is born from 
the remnants of the old one, leading to an endless cycle of creation and destruction 
[44]. 
We, however, think that a more probable scenario is that the universe has no 
beginning and no end; it simply goes on continuously without dramatic events such 
as the Big Bang or Big crunch. Our thinking is that, at the macroscopic level, the 
universe is roughly at a steady state. But of course, in different local regions of the 
universe, various astronomical objects could undergo a variety of recycling processes. 
For example, 
• Recycling of Energy and Matter 
According to the quantum wave model, matter and radiation are just different forms 
of energy; they are all excitation waves of the vacuum. Hence, matter and energy 
will convert between each other almost constantly. It is well known that intense 
radiation can be generated when matter is destroyed in various forms of explosions, 
and massive particles can be created in the vacuum when the vacuum is irradiated 
with energetic radiation. Also, exotic particles with high energy can be created during 
particle–particle collisions. Such energetic particles will eventually decay into stable 
particles like electrons and protons, which can combine to form hydrogen atoms. 
• Recycling of Atoms 
Atoms are the building blocks of matter, and they are constantly recycled in the 
universe. When a star explodes, it releases not only radiation energy but also matter

18.6 Is There a Beginning or an End to Our Universe? The Model …
271
in the form of atoms. These atoms can be used to create new stars, planets, and 
everything on top of them. For example, the iron atoms in our blood were created by 
nuclear fusion in the cores of massive stars, which later exploded as supernovae and 
spread their contents into space. 
Furthermore, heavier elements can be created within the neutron stars or during 
supernova explosions; they can also be broken down to become light elements 
through nuclear ﬁssion. So, different kinds of atoms can be recycled in the universe. 
• Recycling of Stars and Planets 
Stars and planets are also recycled in the universe. When a star dies, it releases its 
energy and matter, which can be used to create new stars and planets. In fact, our 
Sun and its planets were formed from the remnants of previous generations of stars 
that had exhausted their fuel and ended their lives. Also, the debris from a planetary 
collision can be used to form new planets or moons. 
When a star is at the end of its life, it can release its energy and materials back to the 
universe. During the active stage of a star’s life, it fuses hydrogen atoms into helium 
in its core. Once the hydrogen supply is depleted, the star enters the next stage, 
becoming a red giant. During this phase, the star expands and cools, and helium 
fusion begins in the core. Eventually, the nuclear fusion stops, and the remaining 
core becomes a white dwarf. 
For more massive stars, the end of the red giant phase leads to a supernova explo-
sion. During this event, the star releases an enormous amount of energy and heavy 
elements, including iron and nickel. The core of the star collapses, either forming a 
neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass of the star. 
In addition to supernova explosions, stars also release energy through stellar 
winds. These winds are composed of charged particles that are ejected from the 
star’s surface, carrying away mass and energy. The winds can last for millions of 
years. The release of energy and materials back into the universe through supernova 
explosions and stellar winds is essential for the creation of new stars. 
Then, what about the white dwarfs and neutron stars, can they release their energy 
and materials back to the universe? White dwarfs can release energy in the form of 
residual heat, which is slowly radiated away over billions of years [45]. They can 
also be merged with neutron stars or black holes. Furthermore, a white dwarf can 
merge with another star (or another white dwarf) to ignite a Type Ia supernova [46]. 
Since such supernova leaves no compact remnant, the whole mass of the former 
white dwarf could dissipate into the space. 
Neutron stars can recycle their material through merging. When two neutron stars 
merge, they produce a kilonova, which releases an enormous amount of energy, 
including gamma rays, X-rays, and visible light [47]. The neutron star merging can 
also cause the release of heavy elements, such as gold and platinum [48]. These 
elements are dispersed into the surrounding interstellar medium, contributing to the 
chemical evolution of the universe (see Fig. 18.10).

• Recycling of Galaxies and Black Holes 
Finally, galaxies and black holes are also part of the recycling process in the universe. 
When galaxies collide, they can merge to create new galaxies. The Milky Way is 
currently merging with another nearby galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy, which will 
eventually result in the formation of a new, larger galaxy. The Hubble Space Telescope 
has imaged numerous galaxy mergers in various stages of evolution (see Fig. 18.11). 
Black holes, which are formed when a massive star collapses, can also merge to 
create larger black holes or be ejected from their galaxies. Stars within galaxy can 
be swallowed by the supermassive black hole. Due to this extreme gravitational pull, 
matter and radiation in the vicinity of the black hole are accelerated to high speeds

and emit intense radiation, including X-rays and gamma rays. This radiation comes 
from the accretion disk [49]. Black holes can also release energy in the form of jets, 
which are narrow streams of particles that are ejected from the black hole at close 
to the speed of light [49–51] (see Fig. 18.12). These jets can extend for millions of 
light-years. Jets from black holes play an important role in the evolution of galaxies, 
as they can inﬂuence the formation of stars and regulate the growth of supermassive 
black holes in the centers of galaxies. 
One of the most intriguing aspects of black holes is their ability to merge with one 
another. The merger of black holes releases an enormous amount of energy, which 
could be detected as gravitational waves. At present, the mechanism through which 
black hole releases its trapped energy/materials is not yet fully understood. Scientists 
anticipate that more novel mechanisms will be discovered in the future. So, it is very 
likely that the energy trapped inside the black hole will eventually be released back 
into the surrounding environment. 
In conclusion, the recycling of matter and energy in different forms is a constant 
process within the universe. While the origin and ultimate fate of the universe remain 
a mystery, we propose that the “endless recycling model” could be the most probable 
course for the universe‘s evolution. In other words, our universe is most likely going 
for ever, there is no foreseeable end to our universe. 
18.7 Does the Vacuum Have an End? Is There a Boundary 
in Our Universe? 
Finally, before ending our discussion on cosmology, we would like to ask a philo-
sophical question: Does the vacuum have an end? Since the vacuum is supposed 
to ﬁll the entire space of the Universe, would our Universe have an end?

274
18
Exploration in Cosmology from the Quantum Wave View: Is There …
According to the quantum wave model discussed in this book, matter is composed 
of quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium. Hence, we can think of matter 
as a kind of energy. The entire contents of the material world, including atoms, stars, 
and galaxies, are all composed of excitation waves of the vacuum. So, what we 
observe in our Universe, the so-called “material world”, is only the manifestation of 
the Universe; the body of the Universe is actually the vacuum itself. 
Now, does the vacuum have an end? If the vacuum has an end, what is the space 
outside of it? What happens to the world at the end of the vacuum? 
In scientiﬁc investigation, we usually go with a common presumption, that is, the 
simplest answer is most likely to be the correct answer. In that spirit, our simplest 
assumption is that the vacuum must ﬁll the entire space of the Universe, and there is 
no end for the vacuum. 
Then, we need to investigate whether this assumption is realistic. Throughout this 
book, we regard the vacuum as a medium occupying a three-dimensional space. Is 
it possible that this three-dimensional vacuum has no end? 
From the study of geometry, we know some of the objects can have no end. For 
example, for a one-dimensional string, it can have no end if the string is connected 
end to end as a circle (see Fig. 18.13a). Also, for a two-dimensional plane, it can 
have no end if this plane is a part of the surface area of a sphere (see Fig. 18.13b).
Then, perhaps one could generalize the above concepts to a mathematical conjec-
ture: For any N-dimensional object, it can be continuous with no end, if and only 
if this object is the boundary of a N + 1 dimensional object. 
Previously, we have already demonstrated that this conjecture can hold when N 
= 1 or 2. For example, the string is a one-dimensional object, and a ﬂat disk is a 
two-dimensional object. The boundary of the two-dimensional disk is a circle. When 
the string is wrapped around this circle, it becomes endless. (Note: A line segment of 
the circle can become a straight line when the radius of the circle becomes inﬁnitively 
large.) 
Similarly, a plane is a two-dimensional object. It can become endless if the plane 
becomes a part of the surface of a three-dimensional sphere. In this case, the spherical 
surface is the boundary of the sphere itself. (Note: A segment of the spherical surface 
plane can become ﬂat when the radius of the sphere becomes inﬁnitively large.) 
So, our conjecture is true for one-dimensional and two-dimensional objects. It is 
reasonable to expect that it may also be true for a three-dimensional object. 
Based on this thinking, it is highly possible that the vacuum medium ﬁlling the 
three-dimensional space of our world can have no end. The only requirement is that 
the Universe must have an extra hidden spatial dimension, which is not observable 
in our material world. Testing this speculation could be an interesting topic of future 
study. 
So, we can hypothesize that the vacuum is endless. This hypothesis in fact makes 
good sense because it can easily explain what we have observed in nature. Because 
the vacuum medium is endless, its excitation waves thus can travel forever in any 
direction. This is equivalent to say, any stable particle (such as a photon, electron, and 
proton) can travel in space forever until it is captured or collides with other objects, 
just as we observe in a mechanical world. In such a world, there is no center and

there is no edge. Everywhere in our Universe is the same! Also, because space 
has no end, the world would look similar in any direction and is truly isotropic. There 
is no horizon problem! 
18.8 Great Opportunities in Experimental Observation: 
Moon-Based Astronomy 
As noted above, the current understanding of the evolution of the universe is not the 
ﬁnal theory; there are many important questions that remain to be answered. This 
will provide many opportunities for future generations of cosmologists. In partic-
ular, we now live in a world of technological revolution. Now is a great time for new 
experimental discoveries. Our understanding of nature has improved enormously 
over the past century. This is really due to the development of powerful telescopes. 
For example, the space-based Hubble Telescope has greatly increased our knowl-
edge of cosmology. A new generation of space-based telescopes, the James Webb 
Telescope, is expected to perform even better. New advances could be achieved

276
18

by building telescope arrays on the back side of the Moon. These may include 
optical (including infrared and ultraviolet) telescopes, radio telescopes, and X-ray 
and gamma-ray detectors. In addition, we can also set up cosmic ray detectors on 
the Moon to study high-energy particles. 
These moon-based telescopes have many advantages. In addition to eliminating 
interference from Earth and providing clearer images, they can also have longer 
baselines, which can be as large as the diameter of the Moon’s orbit. (In fact, the 
baseline can be further extended to the diameter of Earth’s orbit around the Sun.) 
They can use triangulation to determine the distance of distant objects. 
These telescope arrays can allow us to peer deeper into the universe, and thus 
enabling us to observe events happening at an earlier time. 
Therefore, these future tools may help us answer/clarify some of the major ques-
tions raised in this chapter, such as the Big Bang problem, the meaning of Type Ia 
supernova measurements, the inﬂation hypothesis, and the recycling of energy from 
black holes. 
18.9 Chapter Summary 
• The most mysterious things in cosmology at present are dark matter and dark 
energy. No one knows what they are. The quantum wave model may provide 
some useful hints. According to our model, all particles in nature are excitation 
waves of the vacuum, and some of these excitation waves can appear as dark 
matter because they have certain speciﬁc properties. 
• The Big Bang model is a popular cosmological theory that explains the origin 
and evolution of the universe. The theory is based on Edwin Hubble’s obser-
vations in the 1920s that the universe was expanding. Observations of cosmic 
microwave background (CMB) radiation in 1964 further supported this idea. 
CMBs are interpreted as relics of early thermal cosmic radiation after the Big 
Bang. 
• The Standard Model of cosmology today is known as the Lambda-Cold Dark 
Matter (ᴧCDM) model, which is primarily based on general relativity. 
• Today’s Standard Model suggests that during the initial stages of the Big Bang, 
the universe went through a period of extremely rapid expansion (called “cosmic 
inﬂation”). After inﬂation, the universe continued to expand and cool, converting 
energy into particles. 
• There are still many unanswered questions in the Lambda-CDM model. For 
example, very little is known about the nature of dark energy or the mechanism 
of inﬂation. Furthermore, the Lambda-CDM model and general relativity have 
conﬂicting views on the physical nature of the vacuum. 
• Should time be continuous? The idea of time having a beginning and an end 
is a bold assumption, and current cosmological research has not yet produced 
overwhelming evidence that time had a beginning. With the realization that time

is continuous, and the age of the Universe could be far longer than what was 
predicted by the Big Bang theory, the proposal of inﬂation is perhaps unnecessary. 
• Many exotic models for the end of the universe have been proposed, including 
the “Big Freeze” and the “Big Crunch”. We think the universe probably had no 
beginning and no end; it just went on continuously, without dramatic events like 
the Big Bang or the Big Crunch. On a macroscopic level, the universe is almost 
in a stable state. However, the recycling of matter and energy in different forms 
is an ongoing process in the universe. 
• Is there an end to the vacuum? Does our universe have boundaries? We think the 
vacuum ﬁlling the three-dimensional space of our world can have no end. The 
only requirement is that the universe must have an extra hidden dimension of 
space that is unobservable in our physical world. Testing this speculation may be 
an interesting topic for future research. 
• We see great opportunities in experimental observation. In the near future, it is 
technically feasible to develop Moon-based astronomy. These future studies will 
help us to answer some of the key questions raised in this chapter.

Conclusion and Summary

Conclusion: Matter is Composed 
of Waves 
This book presents a revolutionary idea: matter is made of waves! In traditional 
physics, matter is thought to be made up of massive particles, each of which is like 
a “point mass”. In this book, we propose that sub-atomic particles are quantized 
excitation waves of the vacuum; each particle is just a wave packet. Furthermore, 
the vacuum is not an empty space; instead, it behaves like a dielectric medium. We 
show that the wave equation in quantum mechanics can be directly derived from the 
wave excitation mechanism of the vacuum. From this derivation, one can easily see 
the physical meaning of the quantum wave function, that is, the wave function is a 
measure of the physical movement of the vacuum medium during wave excitation. 
19.1 
The Objective of Writing This Book 
This book is a serious attempt to resolve a long-standing mystery in quantum physics. 
That is, how to explain the phenomenon of wave-particle duality? This problem has 
long been a conceptual challenge in quantum mechanics. So far, no consensus has 
been found to explain this phenomenon. The quantum wave model proposed in this 
book can easily explain this quantum mystery. (For details, see below.) 
In fact, the quantum wave model can explain a lot more than this. As we showed 
in Chaps. 6–11, this model can provide the physical basis for explaining many 
discoveries in modern physics. 
The work discussed in this book is based on a very simple idea: The uniﬁcation of 
radiation wave and matter. More speciﬁcally, it proposes that both light and matter 
are composed of quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium. It is well known 
that light is a quantized radiation wave. This work proposes that matter is also made of 
waves. Thus, one can unify both the physical basis of light and matter. This proposal 
is based on experimental observations that massive particles have wave properties 
like photons. We just take these ﬁndings one step further. Namely, we propose that

Conclusion: Matter is Composed of Waves
a massive particle not only can behave like a wave, but that it is actually made 
of waves! It is more appropriate to call the quantum object a “waveticle” instead of 
a “particle”. 
A key assumption of the quantum wave model is that the vacuum is a wave 
medium. In physics, there are two major schools of thought about the property of the 
vacuum. In classical mechanics, the vacuum is regarded as an empty space. But in 
the study of electromagnetism and optics, the vacuum has long been regarded as a 
medium. We know all physical waves require a wave medium to propagate. For  
example, sound waves are known to propagate in physical media such as air, water, 
or elastic solids. The same must be true for the propagation of light or electromag-
netic waves. That is why in the nineteenth century, many physicists believed in the 
hypothesis that the vacuum is ﬁlled with a medium called “aether” [1]. This aether 
hypothesis, however, was disfavored in the twentieth century. 
It can be said that, this quantum wave model is inspired by the aether hypoth-
esis in the nineteenth century and the discovery of the quantum property of wave-
particle duality in the twentieth century. Its contribution is really on building a simple 
and coherent theory that can accommodate both the physical foundation of light 
(Maxwell’s theory) and the physical foundation of matter wave (quantum mechanics). 
19.2 
What Problems Can the Quantum Wave Model Solve? 
The reason for proposing this quantum wave model is to provide simple explanations 
to problems that are difﬁcult to explain with current quantum theory. Such problems 
include: 
(1) The Physical Basis of Wave-Particle Duality. As demonstrated in diffraction 
experiments and double-slit experiments, we know the electron behaves just 
like a light wave. So, from an experimental point of view, there is no doubt 
that the physical behaviors of electrons and photons are very similar. However, 
the current quantum theory has great difﬁculty to explain it. This is because 
traditional physicists tend to view our world using a classical perspective. In 
classical physics, matter is composed of particles which behave like point mass. 
So, an electron should not behave like a photon! 
The quantum wave model discussed in this book can easily solve this 
problem. If electrons and photons are both quantized excitation waves of the 
vacuum medium, it is natural that an electron should behave like a photon. Then, 
there is no mystery why a single electron can pass two slits to generate an inter-
ference pattern (in the double-slit experiment) or be diffracted from a crystal 
surface following the Bragg’s law (see Chaps. 4 and 10). 
(2) Why Can Particles Be Created or Annihilated? In the particle view of quantum 
physics, it is very difﬁcult to explain why point mass particles can be created 
or annihilated in a vacuum. These observations can be easily explained in the 
quantum wave model. Since particles are excitation waves rather than rigid

objects, when the vacuum medium is excited by an energetic stimulation, new 
waves can be generated, and this new wave will appear in the form of new parti-
cles. Moreover, when such waves/particles collide with other waves/particles, 
they can also create new types of waves. Therefore, waves can be created, anni-
hilated, or converted into other types of waves. From a macroscopic perspective, 
these excitation waves appear as “particles”. This explains why we can observe 
the creation and annihilation of various particles in collision experiments. 
(3) The Physical Basis for the Planck’s Relation, de Broglie Relation, and Heisen-
berg’s Uncertainty Principle. As shown in Chap. 3, the quantum wave model 
can directly explain the physical origin of the well-known quantum relations, 
including the Planck’s relation and the de Broglie relation, based on the Maxwell 
theory. Also, it clearly showed that the Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is 
really based on the fact that the quantum particle is a wave packet, in which the 
frequency spread and the width of the wave packet are related by the Fourier 
condition norm al upper Delta omega dot normal upper Delta t almost equals 1. 
(4) The Physical Basis for the Derivation of the Quantum Wave Equations. In  
the current particle-based quantum theory, there is no clear physical basis for 
the derivation of the quantum wave equation. For example, it was pointed out 
by Feynman: “Where did we get that (Schrödinger equation) from? Nowhere. 
It’s not possible to derive it from anything you know. It came out of the mind of 
Schrödinger” [2]. Similarly, the Dirac equation was derived based on a conjec-
ture that the quantum Poisson bracket has certain commutation properties [3]. 
The quantum wave model can now ﬁll in this gap; it shows that the quantum 
wave equations of electrons can be directly derived based on the wave exci-
tation mechanism of the vacuum, which can be traced to the Maxwell theory 
(see Fig. 19.1). This suggests that there is a natural transition between classical 
physics and quantum physics (see Chaps. 6–9). 
(5) The Physical Meaning of the Quantum Wave Function. The wave function 
in the Schrödinger equation is often called “matter wave”. However, it was 
not clear what the physical meaning of matter waves is. There has been a lot
Fig. 19.1 Derivation of 
quantum wave equations in 
the quantum wave model. 
Since a quantum particle is a 
quantized excitation wave of 
the vacuum, the wave 
equation should be derivable 
from  the wave excitation  
mechanism of the vacuum 
medium. This is shown to be 
the case for all known 
quantum wave equations for 
electrons and photon

Conclusion: Matter is Composed of Waves
of debates about this. In fact, there was a famous debate between Bohr and 
Einstein on this particular issue [4]. According to the particle view, the electron 
is like a point mass; it cannot be a wave. Therefore, one can only interpret the 
wave function as a statistical parameter which gives the probability of ﬁnding 
an electron. This is known as the “Copenhagen interpretation”. Many physicists 
disagreed, including Schrödinger and Einstein. This problem can now be solved 
using the quantum wave model. It is shown that the quantum wave function is 
related to the newly deﬁned electric vector potential Z, which is a measure of 
the displacement of the vacuum medium [5]. Based on this idea, the physical 
meaning of “matter wave” becomes very clear (see Chaps. 6–9).
19.3 
Implications of the Quantum Wave Model 
This quantum wave model not only can resolve some of the outstanding mysteries in 
quantum physics, but it also has strong implications on our understanding of some 
fundamental issues in physics. At present, the study of modern physics is built on 
a combination of quantum mechanics and relativity. These two theories, however, 
have conﬂicting assumptions on the physical property of the vacuum. Particularly, 
the special theory of relativity assumes that the vacuum is an empty space; such 
an assumption is not consistent with the understanding in quantum mechanics. To 
resolve this conﬂict, one needs to ﬁnd a new basis in quantum physics to explain the 
effects currently attributed to relativity. 
The quantum wave model can indeed meet this need. In this book, it is shown that 
the so-called “relativistic effects” are actually consequence of the fact that quantum 
particles are quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium. The following is a 
summary of this new understanding: 
(1)
What is the Meaning of Mass? Why Are Mass and Energy Convertible? 
In the literature today, the basis of mass-energy conversion is often attributed 
to relativity. Recent literature reviews, however, indicated that this is not true 
[6, 7]. This book shows that the mass-energy conversion actually arises from 
the wave nature of quantum particles (see Fig. 19.2). We know energy and 
momentum are related and both of them have their counter-physical meanings 
in the wave view. What about mass? Historically, mass is regarded as a particle 
property only. In this work, we show that mass could also be a wave property. In 
fact, it is found that the physical meanings of mass, energy, and momentum are 
very similar; they are all related to the curvature of bending the vacuum medium 
during wave excitation. With this new understanding, one can easily show that 
mass and energy can indeed be converted between each other (for details, see 
Chap. 11).
(2) Why Can No Particle Travel Faster Than c? Why Do All Particles Have the 
Same Traveling Speed Limit?

19.3 Implications of the Quantum Wave Model
287
Fig. 19.2 Origin of the 
mass-energy conversion 
relation in the wave view. 
According to the quantum 
wave model, the basis for 
mass-energy conversion is 
due to the fact that the 
quantum particle is an 
excitation wave of the 
vacuum medium. Based on 
the same argument, one can 
also predict that the mass of 
a particle is speed-dependent 
It is well known that no particle can travel faster than the speed of light. But 
why is it? Previously, there was no explanation for this experimental ﬁnding. 
It was just regarded as a postulate in STR. With the quantum wave model, it is 
very easy to explain it. We know the speed of wave propagation is determined 
by the physical properties of the transmitting medium. Since all particles are 
quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium, they should have the same 
speed limit (see Chap. 12).
(3) Why Is the Mass of a Particle Speed-Dependent? 
As shown in the above, all quantum particles cannot travel faster than the 
speed of light. Suppose a particle is accelerated in an accelerator, the energy 
and momentum of the particle will increase continuously. Since the particle’s 
speed v has an upper limit c, the particle cannot increase its speed further when 
its speed approaches the speed of light. Its momentum p can only be increased 
through the increase of mass. Hence, the energy absorbed by the particle is not 
used to increase its speed v, but is mainly used to increase its mass m. 
In other words, the faster a particle travels, the harder it is to accelerate. This 
implies that the larger the velocity of the particle, the greater its inertial mass. Thus, 
one can predict that the inertial mass of this particle will increase with its speed. 
And all this is because the particle is a quantized excitation wave; its traveling speed 
cannot exceed the phase velocity of the vacuum medium, which is the speed of light 
(see Chap. 12). 
In fact, the quantum wave model has many more interesting implications. For 
example, it can provide helpful hints for solving the following questions: 
• What is the physical nature of anti-mass? (see Chap. 16). 
• Why are particles limited to Fermions and Bosons? (see Chap. 7). 
• What is Gravity? Is it mass-attracting-mass, or energy-attracting-energy? (see 
Chap. 12).

288
19
Conclusion: Matter is Composed of Waves
For readers interested in these questions, we strongly urge them to read the relevant 
chapters. 
In summary, we believe that the quantum wave model presented in this book is a 
very attractive model. Its assumptions are simple, its arguments are based on well-
documented experimental observations, and its results are highly interesting. This 
model has important implications for our future understanding of quantum physics. 
Furthermore, it has a clear advantage over current particle theory. The quantum wave 
model requires only a single vacuum medium, whose properties are known from 
Maxwell’s theory. In contrast, current quantum ﬁeld theory requires each particle 
to be the excitation of its own ﬁeld. Therefore, the number of ﬁelds in the physical 
world is unlimited. Between “particle” and “ﬁeld”, it is not clear which one is more 
fundamental. 
19.4 
Uniﬁcation of Concepts in the Understanding 
of Nature 
The quest to comprehend nature has been a long-standing pursuit of humankind. 
Over time, our understanding of the natural world has greatly expanded; we have 
witnessed the uniﬁcation of concepts that were once thought to be unrelated. This 
has led to major milestones in our understanding of nature. For example, 
(1) Newton’s theory, which uniﬁed the concept of matter and gravity. This is a 
groundbreaking theory, which revealed that matter is the source of gravity, and 
that gravity determines the weight of matter. 
(2) Maxwell’s theory, with contributions from Faraday, Ampere, and others. This 
theory not only uniﬁed electricity and magnetism, but it also further uniﬁed light 
with electromagnetic radiation. It is a truly conceptual breakthrough. 
(3) The quantum wave model, as discussed in this book. This model uniﬁes the 
concepts of matter and radiation. It suggests that both are excitation waves of the 
vacuum. Previously, it is well known that radiation is a kind of wave. Here, we 
propose that matter is also made up of physical waves. So, the physical nature 
of matter and radiation are similar. 
Because of these breakthroughs, concepts that were once believed to be entirely 
separate are now understood as interconnected and uniﬁed, providing us with a more 
comprehensive understanding of nature.

19.5 To Go Beyond Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy
289
19.5 
To Go Beyond Fashion, Faith, and  Fantasy 
Recently, Roger Penrose1 published a widely noticed book entitled “Fashion, faith, 
and fantasy in the new physics of the universe.”, in which he pointed out that theo-
retical physics today is a ﬁeld that is often plagued by concepts that are based on 
fashion, faith, and fantasy [8]. In his book, Penrose highlights the importance of 
going beyond these concepts. He strongly believed that “Theoretical physics should 
be based on empirical evidence and objective analysis, rather than on fashion, faith, 
and fantasy”. He emphasizes the importance of using rigorous mathematical methods 
to develop theories that are testable through experiments. To him, theories that cannot 
be tested through experiments are not truly scientiﬁc and should not be considered 
as such. 
Penrose was not alone in seeing the danger of the current trend of theoretical 
physics development. For example, a theoretical physicist, Sabine Hossenfelder, 
recently published an article entitled “Science needs reason to be trusted”, in which 
she explicitly pointed outed that, “the particle physics community has always been 
subject to fads and fashions”. “And it’s not only theoretical high-energy physics. 
You also see this in cosmology, where models for inﬂation abound. Theorists intro-
duce one or several new ﬁelds and potentials that drive the Universe’s dynamics 
before decaying into normal matter. Current observational data can’t distinguish 
the different models. And even if new data comes in, there will still be inﬁnitely many 
models left to write papers about” [9]. 
In Penrose’s view, “The ultimate test of a theory is its ability to make predictions 
that can be tested through experiments”. Experimental tests are crucial for verifying 
the validity of a theory and for identifying any ﬂaws or limitations in it. Also, exper-
imental tests can sometimes lead to surprising results that can challenge established 
beliefs and theories. 
Another way to go beyond fashion, faith, and fantasy is to encourage open-
mindedness and critical thinking. Scientists should be willing to challenge estab-
lished beliefs and theories, and to consider alternative explanations for phenomena. 
By maintaining a spirit of inquiry, we can avoid falling into the traps of dogma and 
ideology, and instead remain open to new ideas and possibilities. 
Hence, there is a strong need today to go beyond fashion, faith, and fantasy in 
fundamental physics. As we continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge in 
quantum physics and cosmology, it is crucial that we should remain grounded in 
empirical evidence and objective analysis. 
We fully agree with this spirit. In this book, therefore, we try our best not to judge 
a theory or model by the inﬂuence of fashion, faith, and fantasy. Instead, we would 
like to evaluate the validity of a theory primarily by its logical consistency and ability 
to withstand experimental tests. In fact, as shown in Chaps. 14, 15, and 18, we even  
suggest new experiments to be conducted in the future for testing some of the most 
basic hypotheses.
1 Penrose is a well-known mathematical physicist. He is the recipient of the 2020 Nobel Prize in 
physics.

Conclusion: Matter is Composed of Waves
Besides experimental evidence, we also believe that the truth of Nature should be 
conceptually simple. Simplicity is a kind of beauty! 
This is why we think the quantum wave model is a step in the right direction.

Epilogue: The Route of My Quantum 
Exploration 
Although quantum physics has been developed for more than a century, its physical 
basis is still difﬁcult to explain even today. As a physics student, I was always 
curious about the foundation of quantum mechanics. When I was in high school, I 
read some popular science books during the summer holiday, such as “Introduction 
to Relativity” and “Introduction to Quantum Mechanics”. As a high school student, I 
thought quantum mechanics was amazing. But at that time, I did not have sufﬁcient 
physical and mathematical background to ask the right questions; I could only view 
these quantum phenomena as interesting stories; it was purely for my curiosity. 
I had a chance to learn more about quantum mechanics when I entered the National 
Taiwan University as an undergraduate student in physics. We started to study Modern 
physics in the third year, which introduced the major experimental foundations for 
building the atomic theory. In the fourth year, I took a course in Quantum Mechanics, 
which introduced the formulism of the quantum theory. But frankly, it was incom-
prehensible to me. We were taught by an old German professor who spoke English 
with a heavy German accent. Every class he just kept on writing equations on the 
blackboard, and we copied what he wrote. Apart from getting a lot of notes, I had 
very little knowledge about the principle of quantum mechanics. 
Three Teachers Who Had Signiﬁcant Inﬂuence on Me 
I really started to understand the major concepts in quantum mechanics when I entered 
Rice University for postgraduate studies. I took a course in Quantum Mechanics in 
the ﬁrst year. One of the instructors in this course was Prof. William V. Houston, who 
wrote a textbook entitled “Principle of Quantum Mechanics”.1 This is a well-written 
textbook which explains the basic topics of quantum mechanics very clearly. It uses 
concise mathematics to demonstrate that mathematical models and experimental

can say that I have some preliminary understanding of quantum mechanics. 
During my PhD study, I studied Advanced Quantum Mechanics for another year. 
I started to think about some fundamental questions in quantum physics, but I could 
not get the answer at that time. These problems have troubled me since then. So, when 
I have time, I think about these problems, and I keep trying to ﬁnd a way to solve 
them. During this process, three physicists whom I came to contact had provided me 
with signiﬁcant inspiration. 
Prof. William V. Houston. In the development of quantum mechanics, a German 
physicist, A. Sommerfeld, had made great contributions. Several master ﬁgures in 
quantum mechanics were his students, including W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli. My 
teacher at Rice University, Professor W.V. Houston, worked with Sommerfeld in 
his early years. Houston conducted research at the University of Munich where 
Sommerfeld was his mentor. Later, Houston moved to the University of Leipzig to 
work with Heisenberg. There, he also collaborated with Felix Bloch, Heisenberg’s 
ﬁrst graduate student. 
Houston’s research at the University of Munich was about the motion of electrons 
in metal. At ﬁrst, he and Sommerfeld treated the electrons as particles according 
to the theory at the time, but the results were unsatisfactory. Later, they changed 
their thinking and regarded the electrons as waves; the movement of the electron 
in the metal was equivalent to the movement of a wave in a crystal lattice. Then, 
they got some good results. Sommerfeld was very happy at the time and said with 
excitement, “We have ﬁnally found out the physical basis of resistance”.2 Houston’s 
work provided a new way of thinking; it showed that electrons are behaving as 
physical waves in the metal. 
Professor Houston later became a major contributor in the American physics 
community. After returning to the United States from Germany, he worked for a 
long time at the California Institute of Technology. He had served as the President 
of the American Physical Society. Later, he was invited by the Rice University to 
be their President. When I was a graduate student at Rice, he had retired from the 
position of President but remained in the Physics Department as a professor. My 
early study of quantum mechanics was mainly based on his textbook. As a seasoned 
physicist, Houston was a gentleman-type scholar. I still remember that he often sat 
in the front row during our departmental seminars. He would ask a lot of questions, 
but he was very humble and never behaved like an arrogant authority. This really 
impressed me. 
Prof. Harold E. Rorschach, Jr. When I was studying at the Rice University, my 
research work was mainly experimental physics. Professor H.E. Rorschach was my 
PhD advisor. My research project at the time was to use spin-echo NMR (nuclear 
magnetic resonance) to study transport properties of helium-3 atoms at low tempera-
ture in the He3-He4 superﬂuid. There was a good tradition at Rice University. Students

studying experimental physics were also required to have a deep theoretical under-
standing on how to explain the experimental observations. So, I was working on two 
fronts at that time: One was to build a home-made spin-echo NMR spectrometer to 
do the experiment; the other was to learn the scattering theory in superﬂuid (also 
known as “quantum liquid”) to explain my experimental results. 
In my doctoral dissertation work, helium-3 was treated as a particle to interact 
with “phonons” and “rotons” in the superﬂuid. As mentioned above, in the work 
of Houston and Sommerfeld, they showed that although the electron is a massive 
particle, its motion inside the metal can be viewed as a wave. On the other hand, in my 
low-temperature physics research, the “phonons” and “rotons” are different types of 
excitation waves of condensed matter; but during the theoretical calculations, these 
excitation waves were treated as individual “particles”. 
Therefore, in my doctoral dissertation work, I got a deep impression that some 
massive particles can behave like “waves”, while some excitation waves that have 
nothing to do with real particles can behave like “particles”. This clearly showed 
that in quantum physics, the concepts of “particle” and “wave” are almost inter-
changeable. 
My supervisor, Professor Rorschach, is an excellent physicist. Not only did he 
guide me experimentally, but he also did a lot of theoretical work. Before supervising 
my work, he had close collaborations with Felix Bloch at Stanford University. Bloch 
was the ﬁrst postgraduate student of Heisenberg, whom I mentioned earlier that 
worked with Houston in Leipzig. Bloch was one of the pioneers in the development 
of NMR. In fact, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952 for his work on nuclear 
magnetic resonance. So, my work also involved Bloch’s theory. Professor Rorschach 
received his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was 
hired by Houston to Rice University. He later collaborated with both Houston and 
Bloch. 
I was very lucky to have someone like Professor Rorschach as my supervisor. He 
is a very open-minded person. As a graduate student, when I discussed research work 
with him, I could express my thoughts freely, without worrying whether he would 
approve them or not. In fact, there were several occasions when my thinking was 
different from that of Prof. Rorschach; I would argue with him. He never forced me to 
give in. This encouraged me to develop a habit of thinking boldly and independently. 
Professor Rorschach also gave me a lot of freedom on the progress of my work. 
Although I was supported by scholarship through him, he never pushed me to publish 
papers. 
Prof. John A. Wheeler. When I was a graduate student, I was very curious about the 
physical basis of wave-particle duality. After years of exploration, I got an answer. 
That is, for particles with or without mass (including electrons and photons), they 
are quantized excitation waves of the vacuum medium. This was not a mainstream 
view. At that time, I was an assistant professor, and I was still collaborating with 
Professor Rorschach. He was quite supportive of my non-mainstream idea. I wrote 
my idea into an article and submitted it to Physical Review. The reviewers ﬁrst made 
some speciﬁc criticisms. I fully answered them. However, the editor of the journal

294
Epilogue: The Route of My Quantum Exploration
told me later that, after consulting with an editorial Board member, he decided not to 
accept my paper for publication. I asked for why; but the editor did not want to give 
any speciﬁc reason. I was very disappointed. As a young physicist, I needed some 
encouragement. In addition to the support given by Professor Rorschach at that time, 
another scholar also gave me much-needed encouragement. He was Professor John 
Wheeler. 
Professor Wheeler was an inﬂuential scholar in quantum physics. He had studied 
at the University of Copenhagen under Niels Bohr. He later worked for a long time at 
Princeton University, applying quantum theory to cosmology. He not only conducted 
excellent research work, but also trained many famous students (including Richard 
Feynman). He worked at the University of Texas at Austin in his later years. On one 
occasion, Rice University invited Professor Wheeler for a week-long visit. At that 
time, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Physics at Rice University. 
During that week, I had a lot of contact with Professor Wheeler and speciﬁcally 
asked him to discuss what the nature of particles is in quantum theory. I told him my 
idea of treating electrons and photons as excitation waves of the vacuum medium. 
Professor Wheeler did not think my unorthodox ideas were unreasonable, and he 
encouraged me to continue the work. When he returned to the University of Texas, 
I kept communicating with him. I sent him the article I wrote for Physical Review; 
he gave me a very encouraging reply. Professor Wheeler was very respected in the 
physics community. As a young physicist, the support from a famous scientist to 
my unorthodox ideas was a great inspiration to me. Also, the open-minded spirit of 
Professor Wheeler gave me a very deep impression. 
The Copenhagen School 
In quantum mechanics, there was an especially important school called the 
“Copenhagen School”. Many scientists who made pioneering contributions to 
quantum theory were from this School. The three teachers I mentioned above all 
had a connection with the Copenhagen School. 
Prof. Houston was supervised by A. Sommerfeld while working in Munich, and 
he later worked with W. Heisenberg in Leipzig. Heisenberg and Niels Bohr had a 
very close working relationship. Heisenberg had worked for a long period at the 
Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. Sommerfeld’s work was also very closely related to 
Bohr’s; he extended the quantum condition in Bohr’s original atomic theory to a 
Bohr-Sommerfeld relation. While in Leipzig, Houston collaborated with Heisen-
berg’s graduate student, Felix Bloch. Later when Houston arrived at Rice University, 
he hired H. E. Rorschach. Later Rorschach went to Stanford University to work with 
Bloch. As a result, both Houston and Rorschach had a connection with the Copen-
hagen School. As for the other teacher mentioned above, Professor Wheeler had 
studied at the University of Copenhagen in his younger days, where his mentor was 
Bohr. (The relationship is shown below.)

295
So, from the academic lineage, I was under the inﬂuence of the Copenhagen 
School. However, my current view of wave-particle duality is very different from 
their view. In quantum mechanics, the orthodox interpretation of the wave function 
in a quantum equation is the “Copenhagen Interpretation”. Bohr and Heisenberg 
mainly proposed this mainstream explanation. They assumed that the particle is 
a point object, and the quantum wave function just describes the probability for 
detecting the particle in a particular position in space–time. This is the interpretation 
that almost all quantum physics textbooks now teach. 
When I was a student, all my teachers taught quantum mechanics according to the 
view of the Copenhagen School. I, however, never fully accepted the Copenhagen 
interpretation of the quantum wave function. If an electron is regarded as a particle, 
it is difﬁcult to explain why electrons, like photons, show a wave property in the 
diffraction experiment. In Schrödinger’s days, many physicists called the quantum 
wave function of a massive particle as “matter waves”; they thought matter could 
behave like a wave. Thus, I believe the quantum wave function in the Schrödinger 
equation should describe a real physical wave, not a wave of probability. 
From Quantum Physics to Bio-Medical Physics 
After I ﬁnished my PhD work, I developed a strong interest in bio-medical physics. 
I wanted to use my quantum physics training to study the living system. When I told 
Professor Rorschach about my plan, he was very supportive. So, I started to collab-
orate with a young physiologist (CF Hazlewood) at Baylor College of Medicine. We 
used NMR to study the structure of water molecules in cells. Professor Rorschach 
was very generous; he allowed me to modify the spin-echo NMR spectrometer which 
I built for studying liquid helium to study water molecules in biological cells.

296
Epilogue: The Route of My Quantum Exploration
This work turned out to be remarkably interesting. We found that the physical 
state of water molecules in cells is quite different from ordinary water; the NMR 
relaxation times T 1, T 2, and the spin diffusion coefﬁcient Ds of cellular water were 
signiﬁcantly reduced in comparison with pure water, implying that the cellular water 
is in a more ordering state. 
More importantly, the degree of ordering of the cellular water appeared to correlate 
with the differentiation state of the tissue. Since tumor development is suspected to 
be associated with de-differentiation, we conducted spin-echo NMR measurements 
on murine mammary glands in three different morphological states (normal, pre-
neoplastic nodule, and tumor). We discovered that the relaxation times T 1 and T 2 
(and the spin diffusion coefﬁcient Ds) became signiﬁcantly longer during tumor 
development. This ﬁnding suggested that NMR can be used as an early diagnostic 
tool; it can distinguish the tumor or pre-tumor cells from normal tissue. 
Our discovery was ﬁrst reported in the 1972 APS (American Physical Society) 
March Meeting and became the meeting highlight (see attached Press release by 
APS). This ﬁnding was published in Nature (1972) and PNAS (1972).3 Our ﬁnding 
triggered the development of the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) technology. 
One year after we reported our ﬁndings, Dr. P. Lauterbur published a short paper in 
Nature (1973) suggesting that one can use a magnetic ﬁeld gradient to scan water 
molecules in different location of a sample. Today, the visualization of tumor from 
normal tissues by MRI still relies on detecting the difference of relaxation times in 
the tissue water, as we discovered in 1972.

My physics training might give me some advantages over traditional biologists in 
studying the living system. After the NMR study, I did pioneer work in several new 
areas, including the development of electroporation for gene transfer,4 bio-photonics 
for cell signaling studies and rapid-drug-screening.5 I also collaborated with Dr. 
Roger Y. Tsien (2008 Nobel laureate in chemistry) in using GFP for uncovering the 
signaling mechanism of cell division.6

Epilogue: The Route of My Quantum Exploration
Returning to the Quest of Truth in Nature 
After working for several decades in the study of living systems, I had not forgotten 
about my original interest in quantum physics. So, in the later years of my career, 
when I no longer needed to be concerned about grant proposals or publications, I 
decided to come back to fundamental physics, hoping to satisfy my curiosity about 
the foundation of quantum mechanics. 
Today, there are still many fundamental questions about quantum physics that 
remain unanswered. In the past one hundred years, the application of quantum physics 
has made tremendous achievements. Today’s cutting-edge technologies, including 
lasers, IC chips, computers, mobile phones, AI devices, and satellites, are all depen-
dent on it. However, some basic principles of quantum physics are still not clear 
to scientists. Even worse, many physicists have given up trying to understand the 
foundation of quantum physics. They think that quantum physics is so amazing that 
its principles have surpassed human wisdom; we can only use it, but we can never 
understand it. 
After a hundred years of development, the theory of quantum mechanics today is 
far more complicated than the days of Bohr and Schrödinger. But in terms of basic 
concepts, I am afraid that today’s physicists have not surpassed Bohr’s ideas. In fact, 
there are many fundamental problems in quantum physics still waiting to be resolved 
today. For example, 
• Where do particles come from? Why can particles be created in the vacuum? 
• What are the physical properties of the vacuum? 
• If particles are excited waves of the vacuum, should all quantum mechanical 
equations (including Klein–Gordon Equation, Dirac Equation, and Schrödinger 
Equation) be derived from the physical properties of the vacuum? 
• How to resolve the problem of wave-particle duality? 
• What is the origin of mass in quantum physics? 
For the past twenty years, I have been working actively to explore these issues. 
I was able to get some very interesting insights. Some of my ﬁndings have been 
published as research papers. However, in order to give a more comprehensive picture 
about the true nature of our physical world, I realize that I must summarize my new 
ﬁndings into an easily understood story; that is this book!

Appendix A 
The Aether Hypothesis and the Concept 
of Treating the Vacuum as a Physical Medium 
A.1 
A Brief History of the Aether Hypothesis 
The idea that the vacuum behaves as a wave medium was widely accepted during the 
study of optics and electromagnetism; it was called the “Aether hypothesis”. Before 
the twentieth century, many physicists thought that the space between matters is ﬁlled 
with a hypothetical medium called “aether”, which allows light or electromagnetic 
waves to propagate in it. 
In the study of classical physics, it was commonly believed that action in a distance 
requires a medium to transmit the effect. That means the space cannot be empty; there 
must be some medium in the space to transmit the physical forces, such as gravity, 
electric or magnetic forces. Furthermore, in order for a vibrating wave to transmit, a 
physical medium is required. Since light is a wave, it must have a carrying medium. 
An early proposer of the aether concept was René Descartes. According to Whit-
taker: “Space is thus, in Descartes’s view, a plenum, being occupied by a medium 
which, though imperceptible to the senses, is capable of transmitting force, and 
exerting effects on material bodies immersed in it—the aether” (see E. Whittaker, 
A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity. Thomas Nelson and Sons 
Ltd, 1951). Many well-known physicists, including Faraday, Helmholtz, Maxwell, 
Stokes, and Lorentz, and mathematicians like Cauchy, Poisson, Gauss, and Riemann, 
had strongly supported such an idea. In fact, they were major contributors to the aether 
theory. 
This light carrying medium (aether) is not only totally transparent; it also has no 
mass and no friction. As to the detailed physical properties of the aether, there were 
many different ideas. For example, Hooke and Huygens had independently worked 
on the refraction of light and developed a wave theory of light. They hypothesized that 
light consists of a series of vibration of aether. They considered light as a longitudinal 
wave. However, longitudinal waves have only a single polarization and cannot explain 
the birefringence phenomenon.

Newton also considered aether to be a medium. He favored a picture that “all 
space is permeated by an elastic medium or aether, which is capable of propagating 
vibrations in the same way as the air propagates the vibrations of sound, but with far 
greater velocity”. The density of aether varies. He thought that aether was composed 
of very small particles which could interact with light particles and plays an inter-
mediary role between light and matter. And when the light was absorbed by matter, 
the vibration of aether was responsible for the generation of heat. 
Later, Young and Fresnel conducted several well-designed experiments and 
concluded that light could be a transverse wave rather than a longitudinal wave. 
To explain this, Young and Fresnel proposed that “the aether behaves as an elastic 
solid”, such that the aether can resist the distortion to its body for transmitting the 
transverse wave. 
However, there was a problem to the elastic solid proposal. If aether is a solid, how 
can the planets, such as the Earth, travel through it without feeling any resistance? 
Stoke offered a solution. He suggested that the aether was like shoe wax, both rigid 
enough for transmitting the rapid elastic vibration as of light, but also sufﬁciently 
plastic for slow moving bodies such as planets to pass by. 
A major contributor to the aether hypothesis was James C. Maxwell. In the nine-
teenth century, physicists had done a lot of work on how the electric and magnetic 
force transmit through space. Their works inspired Maxwell to develop the Maxwell 
theory on electromagnetism. By studying the analogy between electric phenomena 
and material elasticity, W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) suggested that the propagation 
of electric or magnetic force could take the same form as elastic displacement trans-
mitted through an elastic solid. He argued that magnetism is rotational while the 
electric current is translational. Based on such thinking, Maxwell tried to develop 
mechanical models of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. He modeled a dispersive medium 
composed of atoms of matter embedded in the aether medium. In his ﬁnal treaty 
on electromagnetism, he used a model composed of a sea of concealed vortices 
that rotate about the lines of magnetic force. By using the results from mechan-
ical vortex motion, Maxwell obtained the same equation of motion for the medium. 
He concluded that light and electric–magnetic phenomena are carried by the same 
medium. 
At the conclusion of Maxwell’s famous book: A Treatise on Electricity and 
Magnetism, (Vol. 1), Maxwell wrote: “If something is transmitted from one particle 
to another at a distance, what is its condition after it has left the one particle and 
before it has reached the other? … In fact, whenever energy is transmitted from one 
body to another in time, there must be a medium or substance in which the energy 
exists after it leaves one body and before it reaches the other, for energy, as Torricelli 
remarked, ‘is a quintessence of so subtile a nature that it cannot be contained in any 
vessel except the inmost substance of material things’. Hence all these theories lead 
to the conception of a medium in which the propagation takes place, and if we admit 
this medium as an hypothesis, I think it ought to occupy a prominent place in our 
investigations, and that we ought to endeavour to construct a mental representation 
of all the details of its action, and this has been my constant aim in this treatise”.

A.2 
Why the Aether Hypothesis Was Later Disfavored? 
The aether hypothesis, however, became disfavored in the early twentieth century. 
Its rejection was mainly due to the following reasons: 
1. The aether hypothesis was not supported by experiments. In late nineteenth 
century, several groups (including Michelson and Morley) tried to use optical 
interferometer to measure the motion between the Earth and the aether. All these 
experiments failed to detect any movement of the aether. These null results were 
interpreted to imply that the hypothetical aether does not exist. 
2. The mechanical properties of this hypothetical aether were full of contradic-
tions. Aether was supposed to ﬁll all space between matters. In order to do that, 
the hypothetical aether must be a highly ﬂuidic substance, i.e., either being a gas 
or liquid. But, aether is supposed to be the medium for transmitting light, which 
is a high frequency transverse wave; in order to do that, the aether must be a rigid 
solid. There is a contradiction between these two requirements. 
3. The aether hypothesis could not explain why large astronomical objects can 
pass through it. Since planets like Earth or Mars can move around the Sun without 
experiencing any resistance from the aether, the aether must be soft enough to 
allow the planets to pass through it. Also, it should have no friction. This is 
contradicting to the requirement that aether must be a solid or a ﬂuid. 
4. The aether hypothesis was revised in an artiﬁcial way in order to ﬁt with experi-
mental observations. In order to explain the null results of the optical interferom-
eter experiments, some scientists tried to modify the aether hypothesis. Lorentz 
and FitzGerald attempted to explain the null result of the Michelson–Morley 
experiment by suggesting a length contraction and time dilation during wave 
propagation. Lorentz suggested that the material body will be contracted in the 
dimension parallel to the direction of its motion (Lorentz contraction), while the 
dimension perpendicular to the motion will not be affected. Thus, when the Earth 
is moving in the aether, everything (including the experimental instrument) in the 
direction of motion is contracted. Such contraction could explain the null results 
observed in the interferometer experiment. The physical basis of the Lorentz 
theory, however, was very complicated and difﬁcult to understand. 
5. Finally, the aether hypothesis was thought to be unnecessary. In 1905, Albert 
Einstein published the special theory of relativity and showed that one can 
obtain the mathematics of Lorentz transformation without the assumption of 
aether. Since Einstein’s approach was much simpler and more elegant, it was 
quickly accepted by the physics community. Since then, the aether hypothesis 
was gradually abandoned.

A.3 
Renewed Interests in the Study of the Vacuum 
with the Development of Quantum Physics 
and Cosmology 
However, although the aether hypothesis had been disfavored by the mainstream 
physicists in the past one hundred years, it does not mean that the hypothetical 
aether is proven non-existent. The existence of aether is still an open question in the 
minds of many physicists even today. In fact, many major contributors to the relativity 
theory had revised their ideas and later thought that aether must exist. For example, 
although Einstein was initially against the aether hypothesis in his 1905 STR paper, 
he changed his mind later. When Einstein presented a talk entitled “Ether and the 
theory of relativity” at the Leiden University in 1920, he gave a very different view: 
“To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities 
whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view.… 
Recapitulating, we may say that according to the general theory of relativity space 
is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether. 
According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for 
in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility 
of existence for standards of space and time”. 
P. A. M. Dirac was a pioneer in developing the relativistic electron quantum 
theory. In 1951, he published a letter in Nature entitled “Is there an aether?” He said: 
“Physical knowledge has advanced very much since 1905, notably by the arrival of 
quantum mechanics, and the situation has again changed. If one reexamines the 
question in the light of present-day knowledge, one ﬁnds that the aether is no longer 
ruled out by relativity, and good reasons can now be advanced for postulating an 
aether”. Apparently, although most physicists had given up the aether concept half 
a century ago, Dirac did not think the aether hypothesis was wrong. 
With the development of quantum physics in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, 
the vacuum can no longer be regarded as an empty space. For example, in quantum 
electrodynamics, every oscillation mode of radiation is supposed to have a zero-point 
energy. Such energy is assumed to be a part of the vacuum system. In quantum ﬁeld 
theory today, the vacuum is just regarded as the ground state of the quantum system. 
Furthermore, not only the empty vacuum model is inconsistent with the current 
Standard Model of particle physics, it is also totally contradicting the basic assump-
tion of the Standard Model of cosmology today. In fact, the models of vacuum in 
the current cosmology theories are far more complicated than the aether medium 
proposed in the nineteenth century.

A.4 
How Can the Quantum Wave Model Overcome 
the Problems of the Previous Aether Hypothesis? 
In this book, we introduce the quantum wave model, which hypothesizes that our 
universe is completely ﬁlled with a physical medium called the “quantum vacuum”. 
This quantum vacuum concept is partially inspired by the earlier aether hypothesis. 
However, there are signiﬁcant differences between our model of the quantum vacuum 
and the aether hypothesis of the nineteenth century. For example, 
(1) Unlike the aether which was supposed to be a medium ﬁlling only the space 
between matters, the quantum vacuum is a pre-existing entity that ﬁlls all space 
in our universe. 
(2) The aether was a hypothetical medium for transmitting electromagnetic radi-
ation only; the quantum vacuum discussed here is a medium for all excitation 
waves, including both radiation and matter waves. In another word, not only the 
massless photons are excitation waves of the quantum vacuum, massive particles 
(such as electrons) are also excitation waves of the same quantum vacuum. 
The quantum vacuum proposed in this work can overcome most problems encoun-
tered by the previous aether hypothesis. First, there is no contradicting mechanical 
requirement for the quantum vacuum model. Since the quantum vacuum is a pre-
existing medium occupying the entire universe, not just ﬁlling the space between 
matters, it does not need to be ﬂuidic. 
Second, one can easily explain the lack of dragging effect in the movement of 
planets. We know all matter are composed of sub-atomic particles. In this wave 
model, these particles are excitation waves of the quantum vacuum. Since there is no 
friction between the wave and its transmitting medium, there should be no resistance 
between matter and the quantum vacuum. Planets can thus move within the quantum 
vacuum without dragging. 
Finally, the null results of the Michelson and Morley experiment can be easily 
explained. All one needs is to show that the wave equation describing the excitation 
waves in the quantum vacuum is Lorentz invariant. This is indeed the case, since our 
wave equation is derived from the Maxwell equations, which is known to be Lorentz 
invariant. In another word, a wave equation being Lorentz invariant is a mathematical 
feature; it does not imply that the vacuum must be an empty space.

Appendix B 
The Concept of Basic Field 
and the Lagrangian Formulation 
of Mechanics 
Quantum physics is basically a ﬁeld theory. So the concept of “ﬁeld” plays a major 
role. In this work, we use the term “basic ﬁeld” to describe the movement of the 
vacuum medium during wave excitation. This term needs to be explained very clearly 
in order for the readers to have a comprehensive understanding of our discussion. 
How does our concept of “basic ﬁeld” compare to the “classical ﬁelds” and “quantum 
ﬁelds” commonly used in the physics literature? The following is a summary of the 
similarity and differences between these different ﬁeld concepts. 
B.1 
Physical Meaning of the “Classical Field” 
The classical ﬁeld is a familiar concept to most people. Examples of such ﬁeld include 
the gravitational ﬁeld and electromagnetic ﬁeld. The term of “electromagnetic ﬁeld” 
was coined by Michael Faraday in the nineteenth century. The classical ﬁeld is a 
numerical quantity assigned to every point in space to indicate the action of certain 
force on the particle. For example, a particle with mass m in a gravitational ﬁeld G 
will experience a gravitational force of mG. In an electromagnetic system, if there is 
an electric ﬁeld E, a particle with electric charge q will experience an electric force 
of qE. The classical ﬁeld is conceptually different from the “basic ﬁeld” used in this  
work. (However, these two types of ﬁelds can be related through certain physical 
laws. See examples below.)

B.2 
Physical Meaning of the “Quantum Field” 
and the Lagrangian Formulation of Mechanics 
In the quantum ﬁeld theory, the “quantum ﬁeld” is not related to force; instead, it is 
an independent variable in the Lagrangian density that can give the correct equation 
of motion for a particle using Hamilton’s principle. Each type of elementary particle 
is regarded as an excitation of its own quantum ﬁeld. 
The quantum ﬁeld concept is developed mainly from the Lagrangian formulation 
of mechanics based on Hamilton’s principle. The following is a short summary of 
this formulation. 
In the study of physics, the main objective is to obtain the appropriate equation 
of motion for a mechanical system, such that the calculation will agree with the 
experimental observations. In classical mechanics, there are mainly two ways to 
obtain the equation of motion (see Fig. B.1). 
(1) The ﬁrst way is to conduct a direct calculation on the mechanical system using 
well-established physical laws of nature, such as Newton‘s laws or Maxwell 
equations. This will provide a direct derivation of the equation of motion (such 
as the wave equation of a photon). Of course, in order to conduct this direct 
derivation, one must have full knowledge beforehand about the physical laws of 
nature, which were developed based on a variety of experimental observations. 
(2) The second way is to use the Lagrangian formulation. One can start by setting 
up a “Lagrangian (or Lagrangian density)” for the mechanical system and then 
derive the equation of motion through the use of a “least action principle” 
(Hamilton’s principle). In this case, the Lagrangian density could be set up either 
using well-established physical laws of nature, or entirely based on the conjec-
ture of the investigator. In the quantum ﬁeld theory used today, the Lagrangian 
density is often determined using “reversed engineering”; that is, the particular 
form of Lagrangian density is chosen in such a way that would lead to the correct 
equation of motion. (For example, the Lagrangian density of the Dirac ﬁeld is 
chosen to give the Dirac equation.)
In order to give the readers a basic idea of the Lagrangian formulation used in the 
quantum ﬁeld theory today, let us review ﬁrst the Lagrangian formulism used in a 
simple classical mechanical system which is composed of a number of point masses.

Fig. B.1 Two ways to derive the equation of motion for a mechanical system. The left side is 
a direct derivation based on well-established physical laws, while the right side is the pathway of 
derivation using Hamilton’s principle (e.g., applying the Euler–Lagrange equation). Examples of the 
equation of motion include the wave equation of light, the Klein–Gordon equation, the Schrödinger 
equation, and the Dirac equation
where i is an index representing different particles. The value of S depends on the 
path of integration in q-space. Hamilton’s principle states that the path determined by 
the equation of motion is corresponding to the path that the action S is at a minimum,

In the quantum ﬁeld theory used in particle physics today, it is thought that all 
quantum particles are excitations of their own quantum ﬁelds. For example, the 
photon is an excitation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld; the electron is an excitation of 
the electron ﬁeld (or called “Dirac ﬁeld”); the muon is an excitation of the muon 
ﬁeld; and the Higgs particle is an excitation of the Higgs ﬁeld, and so on.

Physical Meaning of the “Basic Field” 
In this work, we use the basic ﬁeld concept to describe the motion of a continuing 
system, which could be a classical mechanical system or a quantum wave system 
(see examples below). The basic ﬁeld needs to satisfy two requirements: 
(1) Physically, the basic ﬁeld directly or indirectly describes the local movement 
of the wave medium. 
(2) Mathematically, the basic ﬁeld is an independent variable in the wave equation 
of a mechanical system. In the case that the equation of motion is derived using 
the Lagrangian formulation, the Lagrangian density is constructed based on this 
basic ﬁeld. 
One may see that, our basic ﬁeld is similar to the quantum ﬁeld used in the current 
quantum ﬁeld theory, since both have to satisfy the above Requirement (2). However, 
our basic ﬁeld is more stringent than the quantum ﬁeld, since it must also satisfy 
Requirement (1). 
Furthermore, in the quantum wave model discussed in this book, one can use 
the basic ﬁeld concept to derive the correct wave equation through either the direct 
derivation pathway or the Lagrangian formulation pathway (see Fig. B.1). That is, 
one can choose a proper basic ﬁeld to derive the equation of motion based on well-
established physical laws of nature, or one can use the same basic ﬁeld to set up a 
Lagrangian density and to derive the equation of motion based on Hamilton’s prin-
ciple. In contrast, the quantum ﬁeld theory relies only on the Lagrangian formulation 
to derive the equation of motion; it often cannot use the direct derivation based on 
well-established physical laws of nature, since such laws are mostly unknown for 
many quantum particles.

In the quantum ﬁeld theory today, each quantum particle is associated with its own 
quantum ﬁeld. We know nothing about the physical properties of the quantum ﬁeld, 
except that the quantum particle is an excitation of this ﬁeld. The basic ﬁeld, on the  
other hand, has a clear physical meaning; that is, it directly or indirectly represents 
a local movement of the wave medium. 
In the followings, let us use a few examples to explain these different ﬁeld 
concepts. 
Example 1: Wave Motion in a One-Dimensional Continuous System 
A good example of the 1-D continuum system can be a stretched string (see Fig. B.2). 
We can use the Lagrangian formulation to obtain the wave equation propagating along 
the string (see Fig. B.2). The distance on the string is marked by the parameter x. 
The string has a total length of l. For a 1-D continuum, L is an integration of the 
Lagrangian density (script upper L) along the string,

Let us denote the mass density of the string as ρ. From Newtonian mechanics, we

What about the potential energy V? Again, we will look at a small segment Δx 
of the string and determine the potential energy in this segment (ΔV). The string 
is stretched under tension F1 between two points. For any parts of the string, the 
deviation from the equilibrium position is very small. As shown in Fig. B.2, the  
length of the string over Δx is stretched during the wave motion.
It can be shown that, when Δφ is small,

where c 1  equals StartRoot upper F 1 divided by rho EndRoot √c 1 equals StartRoot upper F 1 divided by rho EndRoot. Equation (B.16) is the correct wave equation for a one-
dimensional string. Since φ denotes the vertical displacement of the string, it satisﬁes 
the physical requirement of being a basic ﬁeld. In addition, as shown in Eq. (B.14), 
φ is an independent variable in the Lagrangian density that leads to the correct wave 
equation, and φ also satisﬁes the mathematical requirement of a basic ﬁeld. 
Example 2: Wave Propagation in an Electromagnetic System 
In the case of a photon, it is not difﬁcult to identify its classical ﬁeld. From classical 
electrodynamics, we know the photon is an electromagnetic wave. Indeed, using the 
Maxwell theory, one can easily derive the wave equations

(where c equ

directly describes the variation of E or H; they are known as “classical ﬁelds”. The 
electric or magnetic ﬁeld, however, cannot be the basic ﬁeld for a photon, because 
there is an additional mathematical requirement for the basic ﬁeld. In the Lagrangian 
formulation of a mechanical system, the Lagrangian density is known to be composed 
of the quadratic terms of the ﬁrst derivatives of the basic ﬁeld. Since the Lagrangian 
density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the vacuum is

Maxwell theory, E and H can be derived from the scalar potential Φ and the vector 
potential A, such that

It has a similar form as the Lagrangian density of a 1-D string (as shown in Eq. 
(B.14)). Thus, in the standard teaching of quantum ﬁeld theory today, A is regarded 
as the quantum ﬁeld of a photon. 
In this work, however, we found that the vector potential A is not a suitable basic 
ﬁeld for the photon. That is because it fails to satisfy the physical requirement of a 
basic ﬁeld (i.e., our Requirement (1) in the above); one cannot justify that A repre-
sents the local movement of the wave medium (which is the vacuum). Instead, we 
found the basic ﬁeld should be an electric vector potential called “Z” that represents 
the displacement of the vacuum medium during wave excitation. (For details, see 
Chap. 6.)

C.1 
The Helmholtz Decomposition Theorem 
The Helmholtz theorem states that any sufﬁciently smooth vector ﬁeld in a three-
dimensional space can be resolved into the sum of an irrotational (curl-free) vector 
ﬁeld and a solenoidal (divergence-free) vector ﬁeld, i.e., 
bo l d u p p er  F
 equals minus nabla normal upper Phi plus nabla times b o l d s y m b o l normal upper Psi comma
where Φ is called the “scalar potential”, and ψ is called the “vector potential”. 
The curl-free component of a vector ﬁeld is often referred to as the “longitudinal 
component” and the divergence-free component is referred to as the “transverse 
component”. 
One can set n a b la dot b o l d s y m b o l normal upper Psi equals 0 by choosing a proper gauge condition. Since the choice 
of ψ is not unique, if the initial choice is b o l d s y m b o l normal upper Psi prime and n a bl a dot b o l d s y m b o l normal upper Psi Superscript prime Baseline not equals 0, one can redeﬁne a new

Example #2: Wave Excitation in the Vacuum Medium 
Similarly, one can apply the Helmholtz decomposition theorem to analyze wave 
excitations in an electrical medium. For the electromagnetic system, it is conventional 
to use the (magnetic) vector potential A as the basic ﬁeld to describe the wave 
equation of an electromagnetic ﬁeld, 
bo l d  u pper B equals nabla times bold upper A comma
where B is the magnetic ﬂux. In this work, we think A is not the most appropriate 
basic ﬁeld for describing the movement of the vacuum medium. According to the 
Maxwell theory, the vacuum behaves more like a dielectric medium. Therefore, it is 
more appropriate to describe wave transmissions in the vacuum based on the motion 
of the electric displacement D instead of the magnetic ﬂux B.

Using the Electric Vector Potential Z 
as a Basic Field to Derive the Maxwell 
Equations in the Vacuum 
In the Standard Model of particle physics, the quantum ﬁeld of the photon is usually 
assumed to be the  magnetic vector potential A. In fact, one can derive the Maxwell 
equations based on the variation of A. In this work, we propose that the basic ﬁeld 
for all excitation waves (including photon) of the vacuum should be the electric 
vector potential Z. So, one may ask if the complete set of Maxwell’s equations in 
the vacuum can be derived based on the change of Z? In the following, we show that 
this is indeed the case. 
The use of Z as the basic ﬁeld can help us easily understand the physical meaning 
of the Maxwell equations. In the vacuum, rho equal s 0 comma bold upper J equals 0,the Maxwell equations are 
known to be

Hence, the electric ﬁeld E is simply a spatial derivative of Z. On the other hand, 
there is evidence suggesting that the magnetic ﬁeld H is a time derivative of the

λ, μ, ν = 0, 1, 2; 0, 1, 3; or 0, 2, 3, one can get Eq. (D.1), Ampère’s Law.

This is identical to the wave equation given in Eq. (6.30). 
In summary, we show that the complete set of Maxwell equations can be derived 
based on the following understandings: 
1. The vacuum is thought to behave like a dielectric medium, where the excitation 
wave is carried by the motion of the electric displacement D.

Was the Relation of Energy-Mass 
Equivalence Derived from Special Relativity? 
In Newtonian mechanics, mass and energy are two entirely different physical 
concepts. In the study of modern physics, we now know mass and energy are 
related by the relation E = mc2. This new understanding was a great discovery 
in the twentieth century. 
A major challenge is to explain the physical basis for the above discoveries. In the 
popular science literature, the relation of mass-energy equivalence was often reported 
to be derived based on the principle of relativity (PR). But a careful examination of 
the literature indicates that such report is not correct. The reasons are: 
(1) The concept of mass-energy equivalence had been suggested by various scien-
tists before the publication of the special theory of relativity (STR) (see attached 
Table E.1). 
(2) Although such concepts were actively promoted by Einstein, his arguments were 
based on special hypothetical situations (which he called “thought experiments”) 
instead of based on ﬁrst principles. 
(3) Many of such thought experiments had nothing to do with PR; some might even 
violate the requirement of Einstein’s theory of relativity (see below). 
In the following, we will give a detailed summary of literature review to show 
that the derivation of the mass-energy equivalence relation was not based on special 
relativity. (Readers interested in this issue may refer to my earlier publication: D. C. 
Chang, Mod. Phys. Lett. B 34, 2030002, 2020). 
E.1 
The Concept of Mass-Energy Equivalence Had Been 
Discussed Actively in Europe Before Einstein 
Near the end of the nineteenth century, many European physicists had become aware 
that the inertial mass can be related to the energy content of an object. For example, 
in 1881, J. J. Thomson studied the magnetic ﬁeld generated by a moving charged

sphere. He showed that the ﬁeld could induce an effective mass on the sphere. In 
1889, Oliver Heaviside simpliﬁed Thomson’s work and suggested that the effective 
mass should be m eq uals four thirds upper E slash c squared
m equals four thirds upper E slash c squared. Later, Wilhelm Wien and Max Abraham got the same 
result, which became known as the “electromagnetic mass”. The relation of mass-
energy equivalence up per E equals m c squared was ﬁrst mentioned in a paper by Poincare in 1900. In 
1904, Fritz Hasenöhrl wrote a series of papers entitled “On the theory of radiation 
in moving bodies”, which also provided an elaborated study of the concept relating 
energy with mass. A detailed account of works regarding the mass-energy converting 
concept had been reviewed by W. Fadner (Am. J. Phys. 56, 114 (1988)). He showed 
that there were many discussions on this topic before Einstein ﬁrst started to address 
the issue of relating the mass with energy in 1905 (see Table E.1). 
E.2 
Review of Einstein’s First Paper on Deriving 
the Mass-Energy Equivalence Relation 
Einstein clearly recognized the great importance of the mass-energy equivalence 
concept. In the same year when he published his 1905 paper on the principle of 
relativity, he published another very short paper entitled “Does the inertia of a body 
depend upon its energy-content?”, which described his ﬁrst derivation of the mass-
energy equivalence relation. This paper (here after denoted as the “1905b paper”) 
was based on a “thought experiment” as summarized in the following: 
Consider a setup as illustrated in Fig. E.1. Let an object be placed at the origin of 
the stationary coordinate system S. A system moving along the x-axis with speed v 
is designated as S’. The total energy of the object as measured in the frame S and S’ 
is denoted as E0 and H0, respectively. 
Now, let this object send out two identical pulses of light in opposite directions 
making an angle φ with x-axis. The energy of each of these light pulses is designated

on e half upper L as measured in the S frame. After this light pulse emission, the total energy of 
the object as measured in the frame S and S, is denoted E1 and H1, respectively. 
Einstein argued that, based on his theory of relativity, the energy of a light pulse 
measured in the stationary frame and the moving frame are different. Suppose the 
energy of the light pulse measured in the S frame is script l, then the energy of the light 
pulse in the S, frame will be

Einstein thus concluded: “If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, 
its mass diminishes by L/c2”. 
The derivation proposed by Einstein in the above thought experiment was very 
simple. However, it is not without problem. For example, 
1. Equation (E.9) was not derived based on ﬁrst principle. Instead, it is just a 
suggested result demonstrated from a hypothetical special situation. 
2. The relation E = mc2 was not an exact derivation; it was an approximation. 
Equation (E.7) holds only when the speed v is much smaller than c. (This criticism 
was raised by Planck.) 
3. The argument for Eq. (E.5) is incorrect. Strictly speaking, the energy of a particle 
is now known to be up er E squ ared 
equals c squared p squared plus m 0 squared c Superscript 4. The total energy in general thus is not a 
linear sum of the resting energy and the kinetic energy. 
4. This proposed “thought experiment” was not realistic. No one can perform such 
an experiment in reality. One cannot ﬁnd a physical object that can spontaneously 
convert part of its mass to emit electromagnetic radiation in opposite directions. 
If the light-emitting object is an elementary particle, the entire particle will decay 
(and it cannot emit photons in opposite directions). If the radiation-emitting object 
is a group of atoms or molecules, the emission of photon(s) can only be due to 
the release of potential energy from their orbital electrons, not due to a decrease 
of kinetic energy caused by the loss of the object’s rest mass, as suggested in this 
1905b paper. 
5. As pointed out by Herbert Ives, Einstein’s 1905 derivation had a problem of using 
circular logic (H. E. Ives, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 42, 540 (1952)). Ives criticism was 
also echoed by other investigators. 
E.3 
Einstein Subsequently Proposed More Thought 
Experiments to Derive the Mass-Energy Relation 
Einstein was not satisﬁed with his derivation presented in the 1905b paper (as 
described above). He tried to use a different argument based on center of gravity. 
He proposed a new thought experiment in 1906. His argument was summarized in a 
concise manner in the book Special Relativity by A. P. French.

radiation energy E) is emitted from the left end of the box. The radiation carries a 
momentum E/c. Since the total momentum of the system remains zero, the box must 
acquire a momentum equal to—E/c. Hence, the box will recoil with a speed v, 
v e q uals minus StartFraction upper E Over upper M c EndFraction period
v eq
uals minus StartFraction upper E Over upper M c EndFraction period
At a later time, t = Δt (Δt = L/c, provided v < <  c), the radiation wave reaches 
the right end of the box and its energy is totally absorbed. It conveys an impulse on 
the box equal and opposite to the initial burst of momentum. Therefore, it will bring 
the box to rest again. The net result of this process is to move the box through a 
distance Δx:
nor mal up p e r Delta x equals v normal upper Delta t equals minus StartFraction upper E upper L Over upper M c squared EndFraction period
norm a
l upper Delta x equals v normal upper Delta t equals minus StartFraction upper E upper L Over upper M c squared EndFraction period
Since this box is an isolated system, one can assume that the center of gravity of 
the box remains unchanged before and after the radiation process. In order to counter 
the movement of the rigid box, one must assume that the radiation should carry with 
it the equivalent of a mass m, such that 
m u pper L  plu
s upper M normal upper Delta x equals 0 period
Combining Eqs. (E.11) and (E.12), we have 
m eq uals StartFraction upper E Over c squared EndFraction or upper E equals m c squared period
m e qua ls  StartF
raction upper E Over c squared EndFraction or upper E equals m c squared period
This suggests that the radiation wave can behave as a material object which has an 
effective mass equivalent to its energy divided by c2. 
One may notice that, although Einstein was able to partially justify the mass-
energy equivalence in this thought experiment, its derivation was not free of problems. 
For example,
Fig. E.2 Einstein’s thought 
experiment. A hypothetical 
experiment in which a box 
recoils from its initial 
position a to a ﬁnal position 
b as a result of a burst of 
radiation energy traveling 
from one end of the box to 
the other

(1) This thought experiment only demonstrated that a radiation wave could carry a 
mass that is proportional to its radiation energy. It did not show that an object 
with mass m can convert its mass into an amount of energy E = mc2. 
(2) The argument in this thought experiment was not based on the principle of 
relativity. Instead, it was based on the assumption that the radiation should 
carry with it the equivalent of a mass m. 
(3) As pointed out by Einstein himself in his later paper (Ann. Phys. 23 371 (1907)), 
this thought experiment violates the basic principle of STR, because it would 
assume information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light. Otherwise, 
the entire box cannot move simultaneously when a burst of radiation wave was 
emitted from its left end at t = 0. 
(4) It has been pointed out that this thought experiment was unrealistic and cannot 
be carried out in practice. Even if it works, this thought experiment can only be 
regarded as a special case; it was not a general derivation of the mass-energy 
equivalence relation. 
Following the 1905b and the 1906 papers, Einstein continued to publish several 
papers trying to give more convincing arguments about the derivation of the relation 
of mass-energy equivalence. His major works are summarized in attached Table E.1. 
These works had been reviewed extensively by various investigators in recent years. 
Many reviewers were not convinced that Einstein had properly derived the rela-
tion of mass-energy equivalence. For example, in a review by T. Rothman, he 
concluded that, “(Einstein) was aware of the shortcomings of his derivation (in 
1905 and 1906) and wrote a half dozen more papers over the next 40 years trying 
to patch things up but arguably never succeeded”. (“Was Einstein the ﬁrst to invent 
E = mc2?,” https://www.scientiﬁcamerican.com/article/was-einstein-the-ﬁrst-to-inv 
ent-e-mc2/.) A similar view was also given by Max Jammer in Chap. 3 of his book 
entitled “Concepts of mass in contemporary physics and philosophy”. A number of 
physicists had also expressed criticism on Einstein’s derivation of the mass-energy 
equivalence relation. 
A more elaborated review of Einstein’s attempt to derive the relation of mass-
energy equivalence was recently given by Eugene Hecht, who published a series of 
papers on this subject in American Journal of Physics in the last few years. According 
to Hecht, “Einstein produced about 18 virtuoso derivations and demonstrations 
all aimed at establishing the mass-energy principle. We have shown that although 
each of them gave evidence for the applicability of E0 = mc2 to a particular set of 
circumstances, no one derivation, or collection of them taken together, succeeded 
in providing a deﬁnitive proof of its complete generality”. “The fact that Einstein 
continued to create demonstrations of the efﬁcacy of E0 = mc2 up to 1946 tells us 
that he knew the deﬁnitive proof had not been accomplished” (E. Hecht, Am. J. Phys. 
79, 591 (2011).). 
Hence, although Einstein had published many papers on the concept of mass-
energy convertibility, his derivations were not really based on the principle of rela-
tivity. Instead, his theoretical arguments were based on various hypothetical thought 
experiments which sometimes implied that radiation could behave similarly as matter.

From the recent literature reviews, it is clear that Einstein’s attempted derivations 
of the mass-energy equivalence relation were not successful. That is probably why 
A. P. French concluded in Chap. 1 of his book “Special Relativity” by saying that the 
general acceptance of Einstein’s derivation was not based on the soundness of the 
theoretical argument. Instead, “its real vindication (is) in the experimentally observed 
behavior of particles”. 
The following is a list of major publications that had implications on the proposal 
of the mass-energy equivalence relation, particularly the works of Einstein. This 
list was compiled mainly based on the reviews of Rothman, Fadner, and Hecht (D. 
Chang, J. Mod. Phys. vol 9, pp 215–240. (2018)).

Is Our World Truly Four-Dimensional? 
Before one can answer the above question, one may ﬁrst ask: What is a four-
dimensional world? Generally speaking, the four-dimensional world is composed of 
three spatial dimensions plus one time dimension. But is time really a 4th dimension? 
Our human experience is familiar with the 3-D world, but we do not have direct 
experience with the 4-D world. We may start with the 3-D world and see what kind 
of mathematical relationship we should have when we extend the 3-D world to the 
4-D world. 
The 3-D world is simple. It can be described in the Euclidean system using rect-
angular coordinates composed of x, y, z. For any vector goes from the origin to some 
position (x,y,z), one can write the vector in the form of
b o  l d s y m b o  l M odify ingA
bove x With right arrow equals x 1 ModifyingAbove x With caret Subscript 1 Baseline plus x 2 ModifyingAbove x With caret Subscript 2 Baseline plus x 3 ModifyingAbove x With caret Subscript 3 Baseline period
This three-vector could be written in a different form:
ModifyingAbove x With right arrow Subscript mu Baseline equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 right parenthesis comma
where mu equals 1 comma 2 comma 3. We know the 3-axes are perpendicular to each other. Each of these 
axes represents a dimension; The 3 perpendicular axes x Subscript mu together form a Hilbert 
space. The amplitude of such a three-vector in the Hilbert space is
Mod i fyi ngAbo
ve  bold

 x  With right
 arrow dot ModifyingAbove bold italic x With right arrow equals x 1 squared plus x 2 squared plus x 3 squared equals constant period
This amplitude (the dot product of the three-vector) is invariant under the transfor-
mation such as a rotation. That means, in the Hilbert space, the Mod i fyingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow dot ModifyingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow is invariant 
after undergoing a rotation. If we denote the three-vector ModifyingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow after a rotation around 
the x3-axis as another three-vector b o l d s y m b o l ModifyingAbove x With right arrow prime, we will have

Since the constant does not change after the rotation (i.e., invariance of the amplitude 
of the three-vector), one can show that the components of the three-vectors ModifyingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow and b o l d s y m b o l ModifyingAbove x With right arrow prime

This is the transformation between the original coordinates and the coordinates after 
the rotation. 
Our world is not 4-D in the Hilbert space 
What happens if we are living in a four-dimensional world? In this case, there should 
be a fourth dimension. That means besides x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3, we should have a new dimension 
x 4. In a Hilbert space, a four-vector should be
ModifyingAbove x With right arrow Subscript mu Baseline equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 comma x 4 right parenthesis comma
where mu  e quals 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4. If we conduct a rotation on this four-dimensional world, it 
should give the similar invariant property as we observed in the 3-D world, i.e.,

However, in reality, we never observe such a physical world which could satisfy 
the above invariance property. We cannot ﬁnd a x 4 that could satisfy the Eq. (F.5) 
and preserve the equation when undergo a rotation. In the real world, there is no such 
case. This implies that we do not live in a 4-D world, which is generalized from our 
familiar 3-D world in a Euclidean system. So, at least from a spatial point of view, 
we do not live in a 4-D world.

The Time Dimension is a Pseudo-Dimension 
in Poincaré’s Relativity Theory 
Then, can we use other justiﬁcation to make time the 4th dimension? This was 
ﬁrst done by Henri Poincaré. Before 1905, Poincaré had developed his own rela-
tivity theory.1 In 1905–1906, he wrote another paper entitled “On the Dynamics of 
the Electron” (The paper was received in the July 1905 and published in January 
1906).2 The invariance is not on the length of the vector itself, but something else. 
Poincaré compared a boost instead of a rotation. A  boost means a transformation 
from a stationary coordinate system K to a moving coordinate system K’. Based on 
Michelson-Morley experiment, people already knew at that time that the equation of 
motion for light does not change in these two different inertial frames K and K’. In 
the K frame, the equation of motion for light looks like 
x 1

When applying a boost operation Mod i fyingAbove x With right arrow right arrow ModifyingAbove x With right arrow prime, the system goes through a Lorentz trans-
formation. According to the Michelson-Morley experiment, the equation of motion 
for light is the same in K’ as in K. This means that it is invariant:

By comparing this with the hypothetical four-vectors in Hilbert space, the time dimen-
sion may look like the x 4. Thus, Poincaré proposed a new four-vector left parenthesis ModifyingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow comma i c t right parenthesis, where

One can also write the four-vector as ModifyingAbove x With right arrow Subscript mu, where mu equals 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4. 
In Poincaré’s theory, this four-vector is invariant in the boost transformation from 
K to K’. From the invariance of the wave equation of light, Eq. (F.7) now looks like 
Eq. (F.5).

Thus, it can be said that we live in a 4-D world based on Poincaré’s mathemat-
ical framework. However, if one compare Poincaré’s mathematical framework with 
Hilbert space mathematical framework, there is a difference. The 4th dimension in the 
Poincaré’s mathematical framework is imaginary; x 4  equals i c t is not a normal dimen-
sion. To be more precise, perhaps we should call the 4th dimension, (i.e., ict), the 
pseudo-dimension. 
F.3 
Minkowski’s New Mathematical Framework 
on the Four-Dimensional Space–Time 
When Minkowski worked on this problem, he developed a new mathematical frame-
work using slightly different notations. His purpose was to get rid of the imaginary 
number i. Instead of denoting ict as x 4, he denoted that 
c t  iden
tical to x 0 period
In this case, Minkowski’s four-vector became
ModifyingAbove x With right arrow Subscript mu Baseline equals left parenthesis x 0 comma x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 right parenthesis
where mu equals 0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3. 
Now, Minkowski developed a new mathematical framework different from the 
Hilbert space. In this framework, he deﬁned two types of four-vectors: 
(1) Covariant four-vector:normal upper X Subscript mu Baseline identical to left parenthesis x 0 comma minus ModifyingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow right parenthesis
(2) Contravariant four-vector: normal up per X Superscript mu Baseline identical to left parenthesis x 0 comma ModifyingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow right parenthesis
where mu  e quals 0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3, x 0  i dentical to ct represent the time dimension, Mod if yingAbove b o l d s y m b o l x With right arrow identical to left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 right parenthesis
represent the three spatial dimensions. 
The covariant four-vector and the contravariant four-vector can be related by 
normal upper

Now, based on the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, we know the equation 
of motion for light does not change in two different inertial frames K and K’. Thus, 
it appears that the length of the Minkowski four-vector is invariant under a boost 
transformation, i.e., 
Start Absolute Value

holds for the K’ frame. By comparing Eq. (F.13) with Eq. (F.7), one can easily see 
that the invariance of the equation of motion for light is equivalent to implying that 
the amplitude of the Minkowski four-vector is a constant under a boost operation 
(i.e., Lorentz transformation). 
One advantage of the Minkowski mathematical framework is that it makes the 
Lorentz transformation look simple. For example, the space–time four-vector is now 
represented by a 1 × 4 matrix, the Lorentz transformation is a 4 × 4 matrix such that 
one can convert the coordinates in frame K to the coordinates in frame K’ by using 
the following relations

√
hyperbolic cosine theta equals StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus beta squared EndRoot EndFraction , and beta equals v divided by c. 
One can see that Eq. (F.13) looks simple and compact. After the boost transforma-
tion, it gives a similar result in the K’ frame. Because it looks simple and beautiful, 
it is easy for people to accept it. Also, the Lorentz transformation, Eq. (F.16), now 
looks similar to the transformation of a rotation as shown in Eq. (F.4) for the spatial 
coordinates. 
The use of the Minkowski mathematical framework thus greatly simpliﬁes the 
notation involved in the mathematical physics studies of relativity.

Using Minkowski’s 4-Vector to Represent 
the Energy–Momentum Relation 
The Minkowski framework can also be applied to represent energy–momentum 4-
vector. As shown in Chap. 7, the energy–momentum relation for a quantum particle 
is originated from the dispersion relation of the quantum wave function, 
ome g
a
 sq u are
d eq
uals left parenthesis k squared plus script l squared right parenthesis c squared comma
where the wave parameters, ω, k, script l are related to the particle properties of energy E, 
momentum p, and rest mass mo. And thus, the above relation becomes 
up er E squ ared 
equal
s p squared c squared plus m 0 squared c Superscript 4 Baseline period
This relation can be rearranged to be written as 
m 0
 squ ared c Supersc
ript 4 Baseline equals upper E squared minus p squared c squared period
Since the rest mass is a constant, the right-hand side of this equation is just the 
dot product of a 4-vector (E. p) expressed in the Minkowski 4-D framework. This 
4-vector is often referred to as the “4-momentum”. 
So, it is clear that the Minkowski 4-D framework is not unique for its application 
in STR, it can also ﬁt in with the quantum wave model.
