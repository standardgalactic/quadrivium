This book forms the lecture notes for my Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on the web platform
Coursera. These lecture notes are divided into chapters called Lectures, and each Lecture corresponds
to a video on Coursera. I have also uploaded the Coursera videos to YouTube, and links are placed at
the top of each Lecture.
Most of the Lectures also contain problems for students to solve. Less experienced students may
ﬁnd some of these problems difﬁcult. Do not despair! The Lectures can be read and watched, and the
material understood and enjoyed without actually solving any problems. But mathematicians do like
to solve problems and I have selected those that I found to be interesting. Try some of them, but if you
get stuck, full solutions can be read in the Appendix.
My aim in writing these lecture notes was to place the mathematics at the level of an advanced
high school student. Proof by mathematical induction and matrices, however, may be unfamiliar to
a typical high school student and I have provided a short and hopefully readable discussion of these
topics in the Appendix. Although all the material presented here can be considered elementary, I
suspect that some, if not most, of the material may be unfamiliar to even professional mathematicians
since Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio are topics not usually covered in a University course. So
I welcome both young and old, novice and experienced mathematicians to peruse these lecture notes,
watch my lecture videos, solve some problems, and enjoy the wonders of the Fibonacci sequence and
the golden ratio.

The Fibonacci sequence
View this lecture on YouTube
Fibonacci published in the year 1202 his now famous rabbit puzzle:
A man put a male-female pair of newly born rabbits in a ﬁeld. Rabbits take a month to
mature before mating. One month after mating, females give birth to one male-female pair
and then mate again. No rabbits die. How many rabbit pairs are there after one year?
To solve, we construct Table 1.1. At the start of each month, the number of juvenile pairs, adult
pairs, and total number of pairs are shown. At the start of January, one pair of juvenile rabbits is
introduced into the population. At the start of February, this pair of rabbits has matured. At the start
of March, this pair has given birth to a new pair of juvenile rabbits. And so on.

Table 1.1: Fibonacci’s rabbit population.
We deﬁne the Fibonacci numbers Fn to be the total number of rabbit pairs at the start of the nth
month. The number of rabbits pairs at the start of the 13th month, F13 = 233, can be taken as the
solution to Fibonacci’s puzzle.
Further examination of the Fibonacci numbers listed in Table 1.1, reveals that these numbers satisfy
the recursion relation
Fn+1 = Fn + Fn−1.
(1.1)
This recursion relation gives the next Fibonacci number as the sum of the preceeding two numbers.
To start the recursion, we need to specify F1 and F2. In Fibonacci’s rabbit problem, the initial month
starts with only one rabbit pair so that F1 = 1. And this initial rabbit pair is newborn and takes one
month to mature before mating so F2 = 1.
The ﬁrst few Fibonacci numbers, read from the table, are given by
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, . . .
and has become one of the most famous sequences in mathematics.

The Fibonacci sequence redux
View this lecture on YouTube
We can solve another puzzle that also leads to the Fibonacci sequence:
How many ways can one climb a staircase with n steps, taking one or two steps at a time?
Any single climb can be represented by a string of ones and twos which sum to n. We deﬁne an as
the number of different strings that sum to n. In Table 1, we list the possible strings for the ﬁrst ﬁve
values of n. It appears that the an’s form the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence.
To derive a relationship between an and the Fibonacci numbers, consider the set of strings that sum
to n. This set may be divided into two nonoverlapping subsets: those strings that start with one and
those strings that start with two. For the subset of strings that start with one, the remaining part of the
string must sum to n −1; for the subset of strings that start with two, the remaining part of the string
must sum to n −2. Therefore, the number of strings that sum to n is equal to the number of strings
that sum to n −1 plus the number of strings that sum to n −2. The number of strings that sum to
n −1 is given by an−1 and the number of strings that sum to n −2 is given by an−2, so that
an = an−1 + an−2.
And from the table we have a1 = 1 = F2 and a2 = 2 = F3, so that an = Fn+1 for all positive integers n.

Figure 3.1: The golden ratio satisﬁes x/y = (x + y)/x.
We now present the classical deﬁnition of the golden ratio. Referring to Fig. 3.1, two positive numbers
x and y, with x > y are said to be in the golden ratio if the ratio between the larger number and the
smaller number is the same as the ratio between their sum and the larger number, that is,
x
y = x + y
x
.
(3.1)
Denoting Φ = x/y to be the golden ratio, (Φ is the capital Greek letter Phi), the relation (3.1) becomes
Φ = 1 + 1
Φ,
(3.2)
or equivalently Φ is the positive root of the quadratic equation
Φ2 −Φ −1 = 0.
(3.3)
Straightforward application of the quadratic formula results in
Φ =
√
5 + 1

≈1.618.
The negative of the negative root of the quadratic equation (3.3) is what we will call the golden ratio
conjugate φ, (the small Greek letter phi), and is equal to
φ =
√

≈0.618.
The relationship between the golden ratio conjugate φ and the golden ratio Φ, is given by

We assume that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches a limit as n →∞. Deﬁne
limn→∞Fn+1/Fn = α so that limn→∞Fn−1/Fn = 1/α. Taking the limit, (4.1) becomes α = 1 + 1/α, the
same identity satisﬁed by the golden ratio. Therefore, if the limit exists, the ratio of two consecutive
Fibonacci numbers must approach the golden ratio for large n, that is,

Binet’s formula

Binet’s formula
View this lecture on YouTube
The Fibonacci numbers are uniquely determined from their recursion relation,
Fn+1 = Fn + Fn−1,
(5.1)
and the initial values, F1 = F2 = 1. An explicit formula for the Fibonacci numbers can be found, and
is called Binet’s Formula.
To solve (5.1) for the Fibonacci numbers, we ﬁrst look at the equation
xn+1 = xn + xn−1.
(5.2)
This equation is called a second-order, linear, homogeneous difference equation with constant coefﬁ-
cients, and its method of solution closely follows that of the analogous differential equation. The idea
is to guess the general form of a solution, ﬁnd two such solutions, and then multiply these solutions
by unknown constants and add them. This results in a general solution to (5.2), and one can then solve
(5.1) by satisfying the speciﬁed initial values.
To begin, we guess the form of the solution to (5.2) as
xn = λn,
(5.3)
where λ is an unknown constant. Substitution of this guess into (5.2) results in
λn+1 = λn + λn−1,
or upon division by λn−1 and rearrangement of terms,
λ2 −λ −1 = 0.
Use of the quadratic formula yields two roots, both of which are already familiar. We have
λ1 = 1 +
√

2
= Φ,
λ2 = 1 −
√
5
2
= −φ,
where Φ is the golden ratio and φ is the golden ratio conjugate.
We have thus found two independent solutions to (5.2) of the form (5.3), and we can now use these
two solutions to ﬁnd a solution to (5.1). Multiplying the solutions by constants and adding them, we

obtain
Fn = c1Φn + c2(−φ)n,
(5.4)
which must satisfy the initial values F1 = 1 and F2 = 1. The algebra for ﬁnding the unknown constants
can be made simpler, however, if instead of F2, we use the value F0 = F2 −F1 = 0.
Application of the values for F0 and F1 results in the system of equations given by
c1 + c2 = 0,
c1Φ −c2φ = 1.
We use the ﬁrst equation to write c2 = −c1, and substitute into the second equation to get
c1(Φ + φ) = 1.
Since Φ + φ =
√
5, we can solve for c1 and c2 to obtain
c1 = 1/

c2 = −1/

Using (5.5) in (5.4) then derives the surprising formula

Table 6.1: Fibonacci’s rabbit population consists of juveniles and adults.
Consider again Fibonacci’s growing rabbit population of juvenile and adult rabbit pairs shown in
Table 6.1. Let an denote the number of adult rabbit pairs at the start of month n, and let bn denote the
number of juvenile rabbit pairs. The number of adult pairs at the start of month n + 1 is just the sum
of the number of adult and juvenile pairs at the start of month n. The number of juvenile pairs at the
start of month n + 1 is just the number of adult pairs at the start of month n. This can be written as a
system of recursion relations given by

bn+1 = an;

Cassini’s identity
Fn+1Fn−1 −F2
n = (−1)n
can be interpreted geometrically: Fn+1Fn−1 is the area of a rectangle of side lengths Fn+1 and Fn−1,
and F2
n is the area of a square of side length Fn. Cassini’s identity states that the absolute difference in
area between the rectangle and the square is only one unit of area. As n becomes large, this one unit
of area difference becomes small relative to the areas of the square and the rectangle, and Cassini’s
identity becomes the basis of an amusing dissection fallacy, called the Fibonacci bamboozlement.
To perform the Fibonacci bamboozlement, one dissects a square with side length Fn in such a way
that by rearranging the pieces, one appears able to construct a rectangle with side lengths Fn−1 and
Fn+1, with either one unit of area larger or smaller than the original square.
We illustrate this bamboozlement in Fig. 8.1 using a square of area 8 × 8 = 64, and a rectangle of
area 5 × 13 = 65, corresponding to n = 6 in Cassini’s identity. We begin by dissecting a square into
two rectangles, the bottom rectangle of dimension 8-by-5 and the top rectangle of dimension 8-by-3.
Here, 5 and 3 are the two Fibonacci numbers immediately preceeding 8.
The bottom 8-by-5 rectangle is then further dissected into two equal trapezoids. The bases of the
two trapezoids are the Fibonacci numbers 5 and 3, and the heights are 5. The top rectangle is further
dissected into two equal right triangles. The bases of the triangles are the Fibonacci number 8 and the
heights of the triangles are the Fibonacci number 3. The dissected square is shown in Fig. 8.1a.
To construct a rectangle of dimension 5-by-13, one of the trapezoids ﬁts into the bottom of the
rectangle and the other trapezoid ﬁts into the top of the rectangle. The two triangles then ﬁll the
remaining spaces. The resulting rectangle is shown in Fig. 8.1b, and it superﬁcially appears that the
the square has been recombined to form a rectangle of a larger area.
The honestly reconstructed rectangle, however, is shown in Fig. 8.2, where the missing unit area is
seen to be almost evenly distributed along the diagonal of the rectangle.
Why is the missing (or extra) unit area distributed along the diagonal of the rectangle? In our
example, the side slope of the trapezoids is given by F5/F3 = 5/2 = 2.5 while the slope of the
triangle’s hypotenuse is given by F6/F4 = 8/3 ≈2.67. This slight mismatch in slopes results in a
steady increase or decrease in distance between the trapezoid and the triangle when they are aligned.
Here, the gap between the trapezoid and the triangle can be easily hidden by splitting the difference
between the aligned pieces, as done in the dishonestly constructed rectangle.

In this lecture, I derive the summation identity

∑
i=1
Fi = Fn+2 −1.
(9.1)
For example, consider the ﬁrst eight Fibonacci numbers, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. With n = 6 in (9.1), we
have
n
∑
i=1
Fi = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 20,
and
Fn+2 −1 = 21 −1 = 20.
One can use mathematical induction to prove (9.1), but a direct derivation uses the relation Fn =
Fn+2 −Fn+1. Constructing a list of identities, we have
Fn = Fn+2 −Fn+1
Fn−1 = Fn+1 −Fn
Fn−2 = Fn −Fn−1
...
...
F2 = F4 −F3
F1 = F3 −F2.
Adding all the left hand sides yields the sum over the ﬁrst n Fibonacci numbers, and adding all the
right-hand-sides results in the cancellation of all terms except the ﬁrst and the last. Using F2 = 1
results in (9.1).

In this lecture, I derive a combinatorial identity obtained by summing over the squares of the Fi-
bonacci numbers:

∑

F2
i = FnFn+1.
(10.1)
For example, consider the ﬁrst seven Fibonacci numbers, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. With n = 6 in (10.1), we have
12 + 12 + 22 + 32 + 52 + 82 = 8 × 13,
where by doing the arithmetic one ﬁnds that both sides are equal to 104.
To prove (10.1), we work with the right-hand side, using the Fibonacci recursion relation. We have
FnFn+1 = Fn(Fn + Fn−1)
= F2
n + Fn−1Fn
= F2
n + Fn−1(Fn−1 + Fn−2)
= F2
n + F2
n−1 + Fn−2Fn−1
= . . .

n + F2
n−1 + · · · + F2

Because F2 = F1, the identity (10.1) is proved.

Figure 12.1: Two golden rectangles. The full rectangle and the rectangle next to the square are both
golden rectangles. Here, φ = Φ −1 = 1/Φ.
To construct a golden rectangle of length L = Φ and width W = 1, a smaller rectangle was attached to
a unit square as illustrated in Fig. 12.1. The smaller rectangle has vertical length L = 1 and horizontal
width W = Φ −1, but since Φ −1 = 1/Φ, the smaller rectangle satisﬁes L/W = Φ, and so it too is a
golden rectangle.
This smaller golden rectangle can again be subdivided into a still smaller square and golden rect-
angle, and this process can be continued ad inﬁnitum. At each subdivision, the length of the square is
reduced by a factor of φ = 1/Φ.
The subdivisions can be done in either a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion. For clockwise, the
square is positioned ﬁrst on the left, then top, then right, and then bottom of the rectangle, and so
on. Eventually, we obtain Fig. 12.2, where the side lengths of some of the squares are written in their
centers as powers of φ.
Notice that each golden rectangle in Fig. 12.2 is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. Objects con-
taining reduced-scale copies of themselves are called self-similar.

The golden spiral
Lecture 13
The golden spiral
View this lecture on YouTube
The celebrated golden spiral is a special case of the more general logarithmic spiral whose radius
r is given by
r = aebθ,
(13.1)
where θ is the usual polar angle, and a and b are constants. Jacob Bernoulli (1655-1705) studied this
spiral in depth and gave it the name spira mirabilis, or miraculous spiral, asking that it be engraved on
his tombstone with the enscription “Eadem mutata resurgo”, roughly translated as “Although changed,
I arise the same.” A spiral was engraved at the bottom of his tombstone, but sadly it was not his
beloved logarithmic spiral.
The golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose radius either increases or decreases by a factor of
the golden ratio Φ with each one-quarter turn, that is, when θ increases by π/2. The golden spiral
therefore satisﬁes the equation
r = aΦ2θ/π.
(13.2)
In our ﬁgure of the spiraling squares within the golden rectangle, the dimension of each succeeding
square decreases by a factor of Φ, with four squares composing each full turn of the spiral. It should
then be possible to inscribe a golden spiral within our ﬁgure of spiralling squares.
We place the
central point of the spiral at the accumulation point of all the squares, and ﬁt the parameter a so that
the golden spiral passes through opposite corners of the squares. The resulting beautiful golden spiral
is shown in Fig. 13.1.

By symmetry, we should be able to mark four possible spiral centers. These four centers are located

Consider again the sum of the Fibonacci numbers squared:
n
∑
i=1
F2
i = FnFn+1.
(15.1)
This identity can be interpreted as an area formula. The left-hand-side is the total area of squares with
sides given by the ﬁrst n Fibonacci numbers; the right-hand-side is the area of a rectangle with sides
Fn and Fn+1.
For example, consider n = 2. The identity (15.1) states that the area of two unit squares is equal to
the area of a rectangle constructed by placing the two unit squares side-by-side, as illustrated in Fig.
15.1a.
For n = 3, we can position another square of side length two directly underneath the ﬁrst two unit
squares. Now, the sum of the areas of the three squares is equal to the area of a 2-by-3 rectangle, as
illustrated in Fig. 15.1b. The identity (15.1) for larger n is made self-evident by continuing to tile the
plane with squares of side lengths given by consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
The most beautiful tiling occurs if we keep adding squares in a clockwise, or counterclockwise,
fashion. Fig. 15.2 shows the iconic result obtained from squares using the ﬁrst six Fibonacci numbers,
where quarter circles are drawn within each square thereby reproducing the Fibonacci spiral.
Consider the close similarity between the golden spiral in Fig. 13.1 and the Fibonacci spiral in Fig.
15.2. Both ﬁgures contain spiralling squares, but in Fig. 15.2 the squares spiral outward, and in Fig.
13.1 the squares spiral inward. Because the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches
the golden ratio, the Fibonacci spiral, as it spirals out, will eventually converge to the golden spiral.

Continued fractions
View this lecture on YouTube
The appearance of consecutive Fibonacci numbers in some sunﬂower heads can be related to a very
special property of the golden ratio. To reveal that property requires ﬁrst a short lesson on continued
fractions.
Recall that a rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers,
and an irrational number is any number that is not rational. Rational numbers have ﬁnite continued
fractions; irrational numbers have inﬁnite continued fractions.
A ﬁnite continued fraction represents a rational number x as
x = a0 +
1
a1 +
1
a2 +
1
... +
1
an
,
(17.1)
where a1, a2, . . . , an are positive integers and a0 is any integer. The convenient shorthand form of
(17.1) is
x = [a0; a1, a2, . . . , an].
If x is irrational, then n →∞.
Now for some examples. To construct the continued fraction of the rational number x = 3/5, we
can write
3/5 =
1
5/3 =
1
1 + 2/3
=
1
1 +
1
3/2
=
1
1 +
1
1 + 1/2
,
which is of the form (17.1), so that 3/5 = [0; 1, 1, 2].

Continued fractions
To construct the continued fraction of an irrational number, say π, we can write
π = 3 + 0.14159 . . .
= 3 +
1
7.06251 . . .
= 3 +
1
7 +
1
15.99659 . . .
,
and so on, yielding the beginning sequence π = [3; 7, 15, . . . ]. The historically important ﬁrst-order
approximation is given by π ≈[3; 7] = 22/7 = 3.142857 . . . , which was already known by Archimedes
in ancient times.
Finally, to determine the continued fraction for the golden ratio Φ, we can use a trick and write
Φ = 1 + 1
Φ,
which is a recursive deﬁnition that can be continued as
Φ = 1 +
1
1 +
1
Φ
,
and so on, yielding the remarkably simple form
Φ = [1; ¯1],
where the bar indicates an inﬁnite repetition.
Because the trailing ai’s are all equal to one, the continued fraction for the golden ratio (and other
related numbers with trailing ones) converges especially slowly. Furthermore, the successive rational
approximations to the golden ratio are just the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, that is, 1/1,
2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, and so on. Because of the very slow convergence of this sequence, we say that the
golden ratio is the most difﬁcult number to approximate by a rational number. More poetically, the
golden ratio has been called the most irrational of the irrational numbers.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

(see Fig. 18.1).
The golden ratio Φ and the golden ratio conjugate φ satisfy
Φ = x
y,
φ = y
x,
with Φ = 1 + φ. We can determine the golden angle by writing
g
2π =
y
x + y =
φ
1 + φ
= φ
Φ = φ2;
and since φ2 = 1 −φ, we obtain
g = 2π(1 −φ).
Expressed in degrees, this is g ≈137.5◦.

which yields g/2π = [0; 2, 1]. The trailing ones in the continued fraction ensure that g/2π is difﬁcult
to represent as a rational number. Indeed, the successive rational approximations to g/2π can be
computed to be 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 3/8, 5/13, and so on, which is just the sequence given by the ratio
Fn/Fn+2.

Lecture 19
A simple model for the growth of a
sunﬂower
View this lecture on YouTube
We can now understand a simple model for the growth of a sunﬂower head, and why the Fibonacci
numbers might appear. Suppose that during development, ﬂorets are created close to the center of the
head and subsequently move radially outward with constant speed during growth. Also suppose that
as each new ﬂoret is created at the center, it is rotated through a constant angle before moving radially.
Our goal is to derive an angle of rotation that in some sense is optimum: the resulting sunﬂower head
consists of well-spaced ﬂorets.
Let us denote the rotation angle by 2πα.
We ﬁrst consider the possibility that α is a rational
number, say n/m, where n and m are positive integers with no common factors, and n < m. Since
after m rotations ﬂorets will return to the radial line on which they started, the resulting sunﬂower
head consists of ﬂorets lying along m straight lines. A simulation of such a sunﬂower head for α = 1/7
is shown in Fig. 19.1a, where one observes seven straight lines. Evidently, rational values for α do not
result in well-spaced ﬂorets.
What about irrational values? For α irrational, no number of rotations will return the ﬂorets to
their ﬁrst radial line. Nevertheless, the resulting sunﬂower head may still not have well-spaced ﬂorets.
For example, if α = π −3, then the resulting sunﬂower head looks like Fig. 19.1b. There, one can
see seven counterclockwise spirals. Recall that a good rational approximation to π is 22/7, which is
slightly larger than π. On every seventh counterclockwise rotation, new ﬂorets fall just short of the
radial line of ﬂorets created seven rotations ago.
The irrational numbers that are most likely to construct a sunﬂower head with well-spaced ﬂorets
are those that can not be well-approximated by rational numbers. Here, we choose the golden angle,
taking α = 1 −φ. The rational approximations to 1 −φ are given by Fn/Fn+2, so that the number of
spirals observed will correspond to the Fibonacci numbers.
Two simulations of the sunﬂower head with α = 1 −φ are shown in Fig. 19.2. These simulations
differ only by the choice of radial velocity, v0. In Fig.
19.2a, one counts 13 clockwise spirals and
21 counterclockwise spirals; in Fig.
19.2b, one counts 21 counter clockwise spirals and 34 clockwise
spirals, the same as the sunﬂower head shown in Fig. 16.1.

Mathematical induction
Lecture A
Mathematical induction
View this lecture on YouTube
Mathematical induction is a method of proof used to establish a statement about the natural num-
bers. The standard example used to illustrate this form of proof is
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
,
(A.1)
valid for n a positive integer. We will suppose that this formula is given, and that our task is to prove
it using mathematical induction.
The ﬁrst step in the proof is to establish what is called the base case. Here, we prove that the given
statement is true for the smallest integer for which it is claimed to be valid:
Base case: For n = 1, the left-hand side of (A.1) equals one, and the right-hand side of (A.1) equals
(1 × 2)/2 = 1, so that (A.1) is true for n = 1.
The next step is called the induction step. Here one assumes that the statement is true for n = k,
and then proves it is true for n = k + 1. Once the induction step is proved, then the statement is
declared true for all integers greater than or equal to the base case.
Why is the proof then complete? Well, if the statement is true for n = 1 as shown in the base case,
then the induction step shows it is also true for n = 2. And if the statement is true for n = 2, then the
induction step shows it is true for n = 3. And so on, leading to the conclusion that the statement is
true for all the counting numbers starting from one.
So let us proceed to prove the induction step. The method of proof usually writes the left-hand side
of the statement when n = k + 1, and then makes use of the induction hypothesis—the assumption
that the statement is true for n = k—and some additional information to obtain the right-hand side of
the statement.
Induction step: Now, suppose (A.1) is true for n = k. Then
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k + (k + 1) = k(k + 1)
2
+ (k + 1)
(from induction hypothesis)
= k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)
2
(from combining fractions)
= (k + 1)(k + 2)
2
,
(from factoring)
and since (k + 2) = (k + 1) + 1, we have shown that A.1 is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of

induction, A.1 is therefore true for all positive integers n.
Because statements about the Fibonacci numbers Fn are typically statements true for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
proofs can often make use of mathematical induction. Oftentimes, the induction step requires the
assumption that the statement is true for both n = k −1 and n = k. When this happens, the base case
must verify the truth of the statement for both n = 1 and n = 2. Then if the statement is true for n = 1
and n = 2, it must be true for n = 3. And if the statement is true for n = 2 and n = 3, it must be true
for n = 4. And so on, leading to the conclusion that the statement is true for all positive integers n.

Matrix algebra
Lecture B
Matrix algebra
For those readers who have never studied matrices or linear algebra, it will be helpful to understand
a few basic concepts. A matrix with n rows and m columns is called an n-by-m matrix. Here, we need
only consider the simple case of two-by-two matrices.
A two-by-two matrix A, with two rows and two columns, can be written as
A =

a
b
c
d

.
The ﬁrst row has elements a and b, the second row has elements c and d. The ﬁrst column has elements
a and c; the second column has elements b and d.
B.1
Addition and Multiplication

Matrices can be added and multiplied.
Matrices can be added if they have the same dimension,
and addition proceeds element by element, following

b
c
d

+

e
f
g
h

=

a + e
b + f
c + g
d + h

.
Matrices can be multiplied if the number of columns of the left matrix equals the number of rows of
the right matrix. A particular element in the resulting product matrix, say in row k and column l, is
obtained by multiplying and summing the elements in row k of the left matrix with the elements in
column l of the right matrix. For example, a two-by-two matrix can multiply a two-by-one column
vector as follows

a
b
c
d
 
x
y

=

ax + by
cx + dy

.
The ﬁrst row of the left matrix is multiplied against and summed with the ﬁrst (and only) column of
the right matrix to obtain the element in the ﬁrst row and ﬁrst column of the product matrix, and so
on for the element in the second row and ﬁrst column. The product of two two-by-two matrices is
given by

Consider the system of equations given by
ax + by = 0,
cx + dy = 0,
(B.1)
which can be written in matrix form as

a

c
d
 
x

.
When does there exist a nontrivial (not identically zero) solution for x and y?
To answer this question, we solve directly the system of equations given by (B.1). Multiplying the
ﬁrst equation by d and the second by b, and subtracting the second equation from the ﬁrst, results in
(ad −bc)x = 0.
Similarly, multiplying the ﬁrst equation by c and the second by a, and subtracting the ﬁrst equation
from the second, results in
(ad −bc)y = 0.
Therefore, a nontrivial solution of (B.1) exists only if ad −bc = 0. The quantity ad −bc deﬁnes the
determinant of the two-by-two matrix, that is
det

a
b

d

= ad −bc.
(B.2)
The determinants of larger square matrices can be found similarly. Just for fun, I can show you the
determinant of a three-by-three matrix:

a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
i


= a(ei −f h) −b(di −f g) + c(dh −eg).
We will need the following result to prove Cassini’s identity:
det AB = det A det B.
Although this is a general result for all n-by-n square matrices, we need only the result for the 2-by-2
case, which can be easily proved by an explicit calculation.
Let

1. We calculate the ﬁrst few terms.
F0 = F2 −F1 = 0,
F−1 = F1 −F0 = 1,
F−2 = F0 −F−1 = −1,
F−3 = F−1 −F−2 = 2,
F−4 = F−2 −F−3 = −3,
F−5 = F−3 −F−4 = 5,
F−6 = F−4 −F−5 = −8.
The correct relation appears to be
F−n = (−1)n+1Fn.
(C.1)
We now prove (C.1) by mathematical induction.
Base case: Our calculation above already shows that (C.1) is true for n = 1 and n = 2, that is, F−1 = F1
and F−2 = −F2.
Induction step: Suppose that (C.1) is true for positive integers n = k −1 and n = k. Then we have
F−(k+1) = F−(k−1) −F−k
(from deﬁnition)
= (−1)kFk−1 −(−1)k+1Fk
(from induction hypothesis)
= (−1)k+2 (Fk−1 + Fk)
= (−1)k+2Fk+1,
(from recursion relation)
so that (C.1) is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of induction, (C.1) is therefore true for all positive
integers.

3. We now prove (1.2) by mathematical induction.
Base case: To prove that (1.2) is true for n = 1, we write F1p + F2q = p + q = f3. To prove that (1.2) is
true for n = 2, we write F2p + F3q = p + 2q = f3 + f2 = f4.

Induction step: Suppose that (1.2) is true for positive integers n = k −1 and n = k. Then we have
fk+3 = fk+2 + fk+1
= (Fkp + Fk+1q) + (Fk−1p + Fkq)
(from induction hypothesis)
= (Fk + Fk−1) p + (Fk+1 + Fk) q
= Fk+1p + Fk+2q,
(from recursion relation)
so that (1.2) is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of induction, (1.2) is therefore true for all positive
integers.
4. To generate the Lucas sequence, we take p = 1 and q = 3. Therefore, we have
Ln = Fn−2 + 3Fn−1
(from (1.2))
= 2Fn−1 + (Fn−1 + Fn−2)
= Fn−1 + (Fn−1 + Fn)
(from recursion relation)

F1x3 + F2x4 + . . . .
We then subtract the second and third equation from the ﬁrst, and use F1 = F2 = 1 and Fn+1 −Fn −

(1 −x −x2) f (x) = x,

1. Consider the set of different possible strings. This set may be divided into two nonoverlapping
subsets: those strings that start with one and those strings for which one and two are interchanged.
For the former, the remaining n −1 numbers can form an−1 different strings.
For the latter, the
remaining n −2 numbers may can form an−2 different strings. The total number of different strings is
therefore given by the Fibonacci recursion relation
an = an−1 + an−2.
Together with a1 = 1 = F2 and a2 = 2 = F3, we obtain an = Fn+1.
2. Again consider the set of different possible strings. This set may be divided into two nonoverlapping
subsets: those strings for which the one and n are not interchanged, and those strings for which they
are interchanged. For the former, the number of different strings is given by an = Fn+1. For the latter,
the number of different strings is given by an−2 = Fn−1. We therefore have
bn = Fn+1 + Fn−1.
From (1.3), the relation satisﬁed by bn is the same as that satisﬁed by the nth Lucas number, so that
bn = Ln.

With Φ + φ =

4. To derive Binet’s formula, we will Taylor series expand the function f (x) = x/(1 −x −x2) and
equate the coefﬁcients of the resulting power series to the Fibonacci numbers.
The roots of the quadratic equation 1 −x −x2 = 0 are given by φ and −Φ so we can write
x
1 −x −x2 =
x
(φ −x)(Φ + x).
A partial-fraction expansion results in

1 −(−φ)x = 1 + (−φ)x + (−φ)2x2 + (−φ)3x3 + . . . .

and equating the coefﬁcients of this Taylor-series expansion with the coefﬁcients of the generating
function for the Fibonacci sequence results in Binet’s formula

.
5. The derivation follows the method we used to obtain Binet’s formula, but here the initial values
differ. We can use L0 = L2 −L1 = 2, and L1 = 1. The general solution to the Fibonacci recursion
relation is given by
Ln = c1Φn + c2(−φ)n.
Application of the two initial values that yields the Lucas sequence results in the system of equations

c1 + c2 = 2,
c1Φ −c2φ = 1.
Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by φ and adding it to the second equation results in
c1(Φ + φ) = 2φ + 1.
Now 2φ + 1 = Φ + φ =

Ln = Φn + (−φ)n.

so that (6.3) is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of induction, (6.3) is therefore true for all positive

Equating the ﬁrst element of the resulting matrices yields
Fn+1Fm+1 + FnFm = Fn+m+1.
With the substitutions n →n −1 and m →m, we obtain (6.4).
3. The ﬁrst result can be obtained by taking m = n −1 in (6.4); the second result can be obtained by
taking m = n.
4. Using Ln = Fn−1 + Fn+1 in the second formula of (6.5) yields the desired result.

1. We prove (7.4) by mathematical induction.
Base case: When n = 1 the left side of (7.4) is F2F0 −F2
1 = −1 and the right side is (−1)1 = −1, so (7.4)
is true for n = 1.
Induction step: Suppose (7.4) is true for n = k. Then
Fk+2Fk −F2
k+1 = (Fk + Fk+1) Fk −F2

k + Fk+1 (Fk −Fk+1)

k −Fk+1Fk−1
(from recursion relation)

(from induction hypothesis)
= (−1)k+1,
so (7.4) is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of induction, (7.4) is therefore true for all positive
integers.
2. We ﬁrst rewrite (7.5) using a simple substitution. Let x = n −r and y = r. Then n = x + y and (7.5)
becomes

Solutions to the Problems for Lecture 9
1. We prove (9.2) by mathematical induction.
Base case: When n = 1 the left side of (9.2) is F1 = 1 and the right side is F3 −1 = 1, so (9.2) is true for
n = 1.
Induction step: Suppose (9.2) is true for n = k. Then
k+1
∑
i=1
Fi =
k
∑
i=1
Fi + Fk+1
= Fk+2 −1 + Fk+1
(from induction hypothesis)
= (Fk+1 + Fk+2) −1
= Fk+3 −1,
(from recursion relation)
so (9.2) is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of induction, (9.2) is therefore true for all positive
integers.
2. We use the relation Ln = Ln+2 −Ln+1. Constructing a list of identities, we obtain
Ln = Ln+2 −Ln+1
Ln−1 = Ln+1 −Ln
Ln−2 = Ln −Ln−1
...
...
L2 = L4 −L3
L1 = L3 −L2.
Adding all the left hand sides yields the sum over the ﬁrst n Lucas numbers, and adding all the right-
hand-sides results in the cancellation of all terms except the ﬁrst and the last. Using L2 = 3 results in
(9.3).
3. Here, we use the relation Fn+1 = Fn+2 −Fn. The ﬁrst list of identities is
F2n−1 = F2n −F2n−2
F2n−3 = F2n−2 −F2n−4
F2n−5 = F2n−4 −F2n−6
...
...
F3 = F4 −F2
F1 = F2 −F0.
Adding the equations yields ∑n
i=1 F2i−1 = F2n −F0, and since F0 = 0 the result for odd Fibonacci
numbers is obtained.

F4 = F5 −F3
F2 = F3 −F1.

Solutions to the Problems for Lecture 10
1. We prove (10.1) by mathematical induction.
Base case: When n = 1 the left side of (10.1) is F2
1 = 1 and the right side is F1F2 = 1, so (10.1) is true for
n = 1.
Induction step: Suppose (10.1) is true for n = k. Then
k+1
∑

i =

∑

k+1

k+1
(from induction hypothesis)
= Fk+1 (Fk + Fk+1)
= Fk+1Fk+2,
(from recursion relation)
so (10.1) is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of induction, (10.1) is therefore true for all positive
integers.
2. Write
LnLn+1 = Ln(Ln + Ln−1)

n + Ln−1Ln

n + Ln−1(Ln−1 + Ln−2)

n + L2
n−1 + Ln−2Ln−1

n + L2
n−1 + · · · + L2
2 + L1L2
Because L1 = 1 and L2 = 3, we have L1L2 = L2
1 + 2, and bringing the two to the left-hand-side proves
the identity (10.2).

Solutions to the Problems for Lecture 13
1. We ﬁrst obtain the equations for the two diagonal lines. Recall that Φ = 1 + φ = 1/φ. With
the origin of the coordinate system at the lower left-hand side of the largest golden rectangle, the
longer diagonal passes through the boundary points (0, 1) and (Φ, 0), and the shorter diagonal passes
through the boundary points (1, 0) and (Φ, 1). The two diagonal lines can then be determined to be
y = −φx + 1
(largest diagonal),
(C.5)
y = Φx −Φ
(smallest diagonal).
(C.6)
Now, the ﬁgure of the spiralling squares is self-similar, and the ﬁrst unrotated copy of the whole
can be seen to have the attached square of side length φ4. If we can show that the drawn diagonal
lines pass through the same boundary points of the reduced-size copy, then these two lines continue
to pass through all smaller copies and must eventually intersect at the accumulation point of all the
spiralling squares.
The longer diagonal of the reduced-size copy must pass through its boundary points (1, φ2) and
(1 + φ3, φ3), and we need to show that these points satisfy (C.5). We will need to make use of the
following relationship proved earlier:
φ2 = −φ + 1.
We proceed by substituting in the x values into the equation for the diagonal line to show that we
obtain the correct y values. For x = 1, (y = φ2), we have
y = −φ + 1,
= φ2,
and for x = 1 + φ3, (y = φ3), we have
y = −φ(1 + φ3) + 1
= 1 −φ −φ4
= 1 −φ −(1 −φ)2
= 1 −φ −1 + 2φ −φ2
= φ(1 −φ)
= φ3.
Similarly, the shorter diagonal of the reduced-size copy must pass through its boundary points
(1 + φ3, φ2) and (1 + φ4, φ3), and we need to show that these points satisfy (C.6). For 1 + φ3, (y = φ2),
we have
y = Φ(1 + φ3) −Φ,
= φ2,
and for x = 1 + φ4, (y = φ3), we have
y = Φ(1 + φ4) −Φ
= φ3,

completing our proof.
The accumation point of the squares is found from the intesection of (C.5) and (C.6). Equating the
values of y gives us the equation
−φx + 1 = Φx −Φ,
whose explicit solution can be found to be x = (5 + 3
√
5)/10. The value of y can now be found from
(C.5) and is given by y = (5 −
√
5)/10. The approximate numerical values for the coordinates are
(x, y) ≈(1.1708, 0.2764).

Induction step: Suppose that (18.1) is true for positive integers n = k. Then we write
Fk+1
Fk+3
=
Fk+1
Fk+1 + Fk+2
(from recursion relation)
=
1
1 +
Fk+2
Fk+1
=
1
1 + Φk
(from Φk = Fk+2/Fk+1)
=
gk+1
2π
(from inspection of the continued fraction)
so that (18.1) is true for n = k + 1. By the principle of induction, (18.1) is therefore true for all positive
integers.
