1.4. THE DIFFERENTIAL GALOIS GROUP
19
Deﬁnition 1.25 The diﬀerential Galois group of an equation y′ = Ay over k, or
of a diﬀerential module over k, is deﬁned as the group Gal(R/k) of diﬀerential
k-algebra automorphisms of a Picard-Vessiot ring R for the equation. More
precisely, Gal(R/k) consists of the k-algebra automorphisms σ of R satisfying
σ(f ′) = σ(f)′ for all f ∈R.
2
As we have seen in Exercises 1.24, a ﬁnite Galois extension R/k is the Picard-
Vessiot ring of a certain matrix diﬀerential equation over k. This exercise also
states that the ordinary Galois group of R/k coincides with the diﬀerential
Galois group. Therefore our notation for the diﬀerential Galois does not lead
to confusion.
Observations 1.26 The diﬀerential Galois group as group of matrices.
Let M be a diﬀerential module over k and let y′ = Ay be an associated matrix
diﬀerential equation obtained by choosing a basis of M over k. Let R/k denote
the Picard-Vessiot extension.
(1) The diﬀerential Galois group G = Gal(R/k) can be made more explicit as
follows. As in Exercises 1.16 one considers the solution space V := ker(∂, R ⊗k
M). The k-linear action of G on R extends to a k-linear action on R⊗k M. This
action commutes with ∂on R ⊗k M. Thus there is an induced C-linear action
of G on the solution space V . This action is injective. Indeed, ﬁx a basis of V
over C and a basis of M over k and let F denote the matrix which expresses
the ﬁrst basis into the second basis. Then R is generated over k by the entries
of F and the inverse of the determinant of F. In other words, there is a natural
injective group homomorphism G →GL(V ).
(2) The above can be translated in terms of the matrix diﬀerential equation
y′ = Ay. Namely, let F ∈GLn(R) be a fundamental matrix. Then, for any
σ ∈G, also σ(F) is a fundamental matrix and hence σ(F) = FC(σ) with
C(σ) ∈GLn(C). The map G →GLn(C), given by σ →C(σ), is an injective
group homomorphism (because R is generated over k by the entries of F and
1
det F ). This is just a translation of (1) above since the columns of F form a
basis of the solution space V .
(3) Let L denote the ﬁeld of fractions of R. Then one can also consider the
group Gal(L/k) consisting of the k-linear automorphisms of L, commuting with
the diﬀerentiation on L. Any element in Gal(R/k) extends in a unique way to
an automorphism of L of the required type. Thus there is an injective homo-
morphism Gal(R/k) →Gal(L/k). This homomorphism is bijective. Indeed, an
element σ ∈Gal(L/k) acts upon L⊗kM and ker(∂, L⊗kM). The latter is equal
to V . With the notations of (1) or (2), R is generated by the entries of a matrix
F and the inverse of its determinant. Further σ(F) = FC(σ) for some constant
matrix C(σ). Therefore σ(R) = R. Hence σ is the image of the restriction of σ
to R.

CHAPTER 1. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY
What makes diﬀerential Galois groups a powerful tool is that they are linear
algebraic groups and moreover establish a Galois correspondence, analogous to
the classical Galois correspondence. Torsors will explain the connection between
the Picard-Vessiot ring and the diﬀerential Galois group. The Tannakian ap-
proach to linear diﬀerential equations provides new insight and useful methods.
Some of this is rather technical in nature. We will try to explain theorems and
proofs on various levels of abstraction.
Theorem 1.27 Let y′ = Ay be a diﬀerential equation of degree n over k, having
Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld L ⊃k and diﬀerential Galois group G = Gal(L/k). Then
(1) G considered as a subgroup of GLn(C) is an algebraic group.
(2) The Lie algebra of G coincides with the Lie algebra of the derivations of L/k
that commute with the derivation on L.
(3) The ﬁeld LG of G-invariant elements of L is equal to k.
Proof.
An intuitive proof of (1) and (2).
L is the ﬁeld of fractions of R := k[Xi,j,
1
det]/q, where q is a maximal dif-
ferential ideal.
Using 1.26 one can identify G with the group of matrices
M ∈GLn(C) such that the automorphism σM of R0 := k[Xi,j,
1
det], given
by (σXi,j) = (Xi,j)M, has the property σM(q) ⊂q. One has to verify that the
property σM(q) ⊂q deﬁnes a Zariski closed subset of GLn(C). This can be seen
as follows. Let q1, . . . , qr denote generators of the ideal q and let {ei}i∈I be a C-
basis of R. Then σM(qj)mod q can be expressed as a ﬁnite sum 
i C(M, j, i)ei
with coeﬃcients C(M, i, j) ∈C depending on M. It is not diﬃcult to verify
that C(M, i, j) is in fact a polynomial expression in the entries of M and
1
det M .
Thus G is the Zariski closed subset of GLn(C) given by the set of equations
{C(M, i, j) = 0}i,j.
According to A.2.2, the Lie algebra of G can be described as the set of matri-
ces M ∈Mn(C) such that 1+ϵM lies in G(C[ϵ]). This property of M translates
into, the k-linear derivation DM : R0 →R0, given by (DMXi,j) = (Xi,j)M,
has the property DM(q) ⊂q. Clearly DM commutes with the diﬀerentiation
of R0. Thus the property DM(q) ⊂q is equivalent to DM induces a k-linear
derivation on R commuting with ′. The latter extends uniquely to a k-linear
derivation of L commuting with ′. One can also start with a k-linear derivation
of L commuting with ′ and deduce a matrix M ∈Mn(C) as above.
Formalization of the proof of (1) and (2).
Instead of working with G as a group of matrices, one introduces a functor G
from the category of C-algebras to the category of groups. Further G(C) = G.
It will be shown that this functor is representable by a certain ﬁnitely generated
C-algebra U. It follows that Max(U) (or Spec(U)) is a linear algebraic group
and G is identiﬁed with the set of C-valued points of this linear algebraic group.
We refer to the appendices for the terminology used here.
For any C-algebra B (always commutative and with a unit element) one
deﬁnes diﬀerential rings k⊗CB, R⊗CB with derivations given by (f⊗b)′ = f ′⊗b

1.4. THE DIFFERENTIAL GALOIS GROUP
21
for f ∈k or R. The ring of constants of the two diﬀerential rings is B. The group
G(B) is deﬁned to be the group of the k ⊗B-linear automorpisms of R ⊗C B
commuting with the derivation. It is evident that G is a functor. As above for
the case B = C, one can describe the elements of G(B) as the group of matrices
M ∈GLn(B) such that the diﬀerential automorphism σM of k[Xi,j,
1
det] ⊗B,
given by the formula (σMXi,j) = (Xi,j)M, has the property σM(q) ⊂(q). Here
(q) is the ideal of k[Xi,j,
1
det] ⊗B generated by q.
In order to show that G is representable we make for B the choice C[Ys,t,
1
det]
(with the usual sloppy notation) and we consider the matrix M0 = (Ys,t) and
write
σM0(qj)mod (q) ∈R ⊗C C[Ys,t,
1
det] as a ﬁnite sum

i
C(M0, i, j)ei with all C(M0, i, j) ∈C[Ys,t, 1
det].
Let I ⊂C[Ys,t,
1
det] denote the ideal generated by all C(M0, i, j). Now we claim
that U := C[Ys,t,
1
det]/I represents G.
Let B be any C-algebra and σ ∈G(B) identiﬁed with σM for some M ∈
GLn(B). One deﬁnes the C-algebra homomorphism φ : C[Ys,t,
1
det] →B by
(φYs,t) = M. The condition on M implies that the kernel of φ contains I. Thus
we ﬁnd a unique C-algebra homomorphism ψ : U →B with ψ(M0mod I) = M.
This proves the claim. According to Appendix B the fact that G is a functor
with values in the category of groups implies that Spec(U) is a linear algebraic
group. A result of Cartier ([301], Ch. 11.4) states that linear algebraic groups
over a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 are reduced. Hence I is a radical ideal.
Finally, the Lie algebra of the linear algebraic group is equal to the kernel of
G(C[ϵ]) →G(C) (where ϵ2 = 0 and C[ϵ] →C is given by ϵ →0). The elements
in this kernel are identiﬁed with the diﬀerential automorphisms of R ⊗C C[ϵ]
over k ⊗C C[ϵ] having the form 1 + ϵD. The set of D’s described here is easily
identiﬁed with the k-linear derivations of R commuting with the diﬀerentiation
on R.
(3) Let a = b
c ∈L\k with b, c ∈R and let d = b ⊗c −c ⊗b ∈R ⊗k R. From
Exercise A.15, one has that d ̸= 0. Lemma A.16 implies that the ring R⊗kR has
no nilpotent elements since the characteristic of k is zero. Let J be a maximal
diﬀerential ideal in the diﬀerential ring (R ⊗k R)[ 1
d], where the derivation is
given by (r1 ⊗r2)′ = r′
1 ⊗r2 + r1 ⊗r′
2. Consider the two obvious morphisms
φi : R →N := (R ⊗k R)[ 1
d]/J. The images of the φi are generated (over k)
by fundamental matrices of the same matrix diﬀerential equation. Therefore
both images are equal to a certain subring S ⊂N and the maps φi : R →S
are isomorphisms. This induces an element σ ∈G with φ1 = φ2σ. The image
of d in N is equal to φ1(b)φ2(c) −φ1(c)φ2(b). Since the image of d in N is
nonzero, one ﬁnds φ1(b)φ2(c) ̸= φ1(c)φ2(b). Therefore φ2((σb)c) ̸= φ2((σc)b)
and so (σb)c ̸= (σc)b. This implies σ( b
c) ̸= b
c.

CHAPTER 1. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY
Now we give a geometric formulation of the Picard-Vessiot ring and the
action of the diﬀerential Galois group. The notations of the proof of the The-
orem 1.27 will be used. The Picard-Vessiot ring R is written as k[Xi,j,
1
det]/q.
Deﬁne Z = max(R). We have shown that Z is a reduced, irreducible subspace
of GLn,k := max(k[Xi,j,
1
det]). The diﬀerential Galois group G ⊂GLn(C) has
been identiﬁed with the group consisting of the elements g ∈GLn(C) such
that Zg = Z (or equivalently g leaves the ideal q invariant).
The multipli-
cation on GLn,k induces a morphism of k-aﬃne varieties, m : Z ×C G →Z,
given by (z, g) →zg. The morphism m is a group action in the sense that
(zg1)g2 = z(g1g2) for z ∈Z and g1, g2 ∈G.
The next technical step is to prove that the morphism Z ×C G →Z ×k Z,
given by (z, g) →(zg, z), is an isomorphism of aﬃne varieties over k. This is
precisely the deﬁnition of “Z is a G-torsor over k”(c.f. Appendix A.2.6). Put
Gk = G⊗C k. This abuse of notation means that Gk is the algebraic group over
k, whose coordinate ring is C[G] ⊗C k. Then one has Z ×C G = Z ×k Gk. Since
both Z and Gk are contained in GLn,k and the Gk-action on Z is multiplication
on the right, the statement that Z is a G-torsor roughly means that Z ⊂GLn,k
is a right coset for the subgroup Gk.
If Z happens to have a k-rational point p, i.e., Z(k) ̸= ∅, then Z is a G-torsor,
if and only if Z = pGk. In this case Z is called a trivial torsor. In the general
situation with Z ⊂GLn,k and G ⊂GLn,C, the statement that Z is a G-torsor
means that for some ﬁeld extension F ⊃k, one has that ZF := Z ⊗k F is a right
coset of GF := G ⊗C F in GLn,F . See the appendices for more information.
Theorem 1.28 Let R be a Picard-Vessiot ring with diﬀerential Galois group
G. Then Z = max(R) is a G-torsor over k.
Proof.
We keep the above notation. We will show that ZL is a right coset for
GL, where L is the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld, equal to the ﬁeld of fractions of R. This
will prove the theorem. Consider the following rings
k[Xi,j, 1
det] ⊂L[Xi,j, 1
det] = L[Ys,t, 1
det] ⊃C[Ys,t, 1
det],
where the relation between the variables Xi,j and Ys,t is given by the for-
mula (Xi,j) = (ra,b)(Ys,t). The elements ra,b ∈L are the images of Xa,b in
k[Xi,j,
1
det]/q ⊂L. The three rings have a diﬀerentiation and a Gal(L/k)-action.
The diﬀerentiation is given by the known diﬀerentiation on L and by the formula
(X′
i,j) = A(Xi,j). Since (ra,b) is a fundamental matrix for the equation one has
Y ′
s,t = 0 for all s, t and the diﬀerentiation on C[Ys,t,
1
det] is trivial. The Gal(L/k)-
action is induced by the Gal(L/k)-action on L. Thus Gal(L/k) acts trivially
on k[Xi,j,
1
det]. For any σ ∈Gal(L/k) one has (σra,b) = (ra,b)M for a certain
M ∈G(C). Then (σYs,t) = M −1(Ys,t). In other words, the Gal(L/k)-action on
C[Ys,t,
1
det] is translated into an action of the algebraic subgroup G ⊂GLn,C
deﬁned by the ideal I, constructed in the proof of Theorem 1.27. Let us admit
for the moment the following lemma.

1.4. THE DIFFERENTIAL GALOIS GROUP
23
Lemma 1.29 The map I →(I) from the set of ideals of k[Xi,j,
1
det] to the set
of Gal(L/k)-invariant ideals of L[Xi,j,
1
det] is a bijection. The inverse map is
given by J →J ∩k[Xi,j,
1
det].
Combining this with the similar Lemma 1.23, one ﬁnds a bijection between the
diﬀerential ideals of k[Xi,j,
1
det] and the Gal(L/k)-invariant ideals of C[Ys,t,
1
det].
A maximal diﬀerential ideal of the ﬁrst ring corresponds to a maximal Gal(L/k)-
invariant ideal of the second ring. Thus r := qL[Xi,j,
1
det] ∩C[Ys,t,
1
det] is a
maximal Gal(L/k)-invariant ideal of the second ring.
By this maximality r
is a radical ideal and its zero set W ⊂GLn(C) is minimal w.r.t. Gal(L/k)-
invariance.
Thus W is a left coset in GLn(C) for the group G(C), seen as
subgroup of GLn(C). The matrix 1 belongs to W. Indeed, q is contained in the
ideal of L[Xi,j,
1
det] generated by {Xi,j −ri,j}i,j. This ideal is also generated
by {Ys,t −δs,t}s,t. The intersection of this ideal with C[Ys,t,
1
det] is the ideal
deﬁning {1} ⊂GLn,C. Thus W = G.
One concludes that
L ⊗k R = L ⊗k (k[Xi,j, 1
det]/q) ∼= L ⊗C (C[Ys,t, 1
det]/r) ∼= L ⊗C U.
This isomorphism translates into ZL = (ra,b)GL. A proof of Lemma 1.29 ﬁnishes
the proof of the theorem.
2
Proof of lemma 1.29.
The proof is rather similar to the one of lemma 1.23. The only thing that we
have to verify is that every Gal(L/k)-invariant ideal J of L[Xi,j,
1
det] is generated
by I := J ∩k[Xi,j,
1
det]. Choose a basis {ea}a∈A of k[Xi,j,
1
det] over k. Any f ∈J
can uniquely be written as a ﬁnite sum 
a ℓaea with all ℓa ∈L. The length
l(f) of f is deﬁned as the number of a ∈A with ℓa ̸= 0. By induction on the
length we will show that f ∈(I).
For l(f) = 0 or 1, this is trivial. Suppose l(f) > 1. We may, after multi-
plication by a non-zero element of L suppose that ℓa1 = 1 for some a1. If all
ℓa ∈k, then f ∈(I). If not, then there exists an a2 with ℓa2 ∈L \ k. For any
σ ∈Gal(L/k), the length of σ(f) −f is less than l(f). Thus σ(f) −f ∈(I).
According to Theorem 1.27, there exists a σ with σ(ℓa2) ̸= ℓa2. As above,
one ﬁnds that σ(ℓ−1
a2 f) −ℓ−1
a2 f ∈(I). Then
σ(ℓ−1
a2 f) −ℓ−1
a2 f = σ(ℓ−1
a2 )(σ(f) −f) + (σ(ℓ−1
a2 ) −ℓ−1
a2 )f.
From σ(ℓ−1
a2 ) −ℓ−1
a2 ∈L∗, it follows that f ∈(I).
2
Corollary 1.30 Let R be a Picard-Vessiot ring for the equation y′ = Ay over
k. Let L be the ﬁeld of fractions of R. Put Z = Spec(R). Let G denote the
diﬀerential Galois group and C[G] the coordinate ring of G and let g denote the
Lie algebra of G. Then:
(1) There is a ﬁnite extension ˜k ⊃k such that Z˜k ∼= G˜k.

24
CHAPTER 1. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY
(2) Z is smooth and connected.
(3) The transcendence degree of L/k is equal to the dimension of G.
(4) Let H be a subgroup of G with Zariski closure H. Then LH = k if and only
if H = G.
Proof.
(1) Take a B ∈Z(k). Then B is deﬁned over some ﬁnite extension ˜k
of k. Over this extension the torsor becomes trivial.
(2) By Proposition 1.20, Z is connected. The algebraic group G is smooth over
C. Using that smoothness is preserved in “both directions” by ﬁeld extensions,
one has that Z is smooth over k.
(3) The transcendence degree of L/k is equal to the Krull dimension of R and
the one of ˜k ⊗k R ∼= ˜k ⊗C[G]. The latter is equal to the dimension of G.
(4) It is easily seen that LH = LH. Therefore we may suppose that H is Zariski
closed. By 1.27, LG = k.
Suppose now LH = k. Fix a ﬁnite extension ˜k ⊃k such that ˜k ⊗k R ∼=
˜k ⊗C C[G]. Let Qt(C[G]) be the total ring of fractions of C[G]. Then the total
rings of fractions of ˜k⊗k R and ˜k⊗C C[G] are ˜k⊗k L and ˜k⊗C Qt(C[G]). Taking
H-invariants leads to ˜k ⊗k LH ∼= ˜k ⊗C Qt(C[G])H. The ring Qt(C[G])H consists
of the H-invariant rational functions on G. The latter is the same as ring of the
rational functions on G/H (see [141], §12). Therefore LH = k implies H = G.
2
The proof of the Theorem 1.27 is not constructive; although it tells us that
the Galois group is a linear algebraic group it does not give us a way to calculate
this group. Nonetheless the following proposition yields some restrictions on this
group.
Proposition 1.31 Consider the equation y′ = Ay over k with Galois group G
and torsor Z. Let g denote the Lie algebra of G.
(1)
Let H ⊂GLn,C be a connected algebraic subgroup with Lie algebra h. If
A ∈h(k), then G is contained in (a conjugate of) H.
(2) Z is a trivial torsor if and only if there is an equivalent equation v′ = ˜Av
such that ˜A ∈g(k).
Proof.
(1) Let H ⊂GLn,C by given by the radical ideal I ⊂C[Xi,j,
1
det]. Let
(I) denote the ideal in k[Xi,j,
1
det] generated by I. As before, one deﬁnes a
derivation on k[Xi,j,
1
det] by the formula (X′
i,j) = A(Xi,j). We claim that (I) is
a diﬀerential ideal.
It suﬃces to show that for any f ∈I the element f ′ lies in (I).
Since
det is invertible, we may suppose that f is a polynomial in the n2 variables
Xi,j with coeﬃcients in C. The element f is seen as a map from Mn(k) to k,
where k denotes an algebraic closure of k. The ideal (I) is a radical ideal, since
(C[Xi,j,
1
det]/I) ⊗C k has no nilpotent elements. Therefore f ′ ∈(I) if f ′(B) = 0
for all B ∈H(k).

1.4. THE DIFFERENTIAL GALOIS GROUP
25
Now we use the terminology of Section A.2.2. One has 1 + ϵA ∈H(k[ϵ]) and
B + ϵAB ∈H(k[ϵ]). Hence 0 = f(B + ϵAB) = ϵ 
i,j(AB)i,j
∂f
∂Xi,j (B).
Further f ′ = 
i,j X′
i,j
∂f
∂Xi,j = 
i,j(A · (Xs,t))i,j
∂f
∂Xi,j . Hence f ′(B) = 0.
Let q ⊃(I) be a maximal diﬀerential ideal of k[Xi,j,
1
det]. Let Z ⊂Hk ⊂
GLn,k be the reduced, irreducible subspace deﬁned by q. For any M in the
diﬀerential Galois group and any B ∈Z(k) one has BM ∈Z(k) and thus
M ∈H(k). Further H(k) ∩GLn(C) = H(C).
(2) If ˜A ∈g(k), then the proof of part (1) yields that Gk is its torsor and BGk
is the torsor of y′ = Ay.
If Z is a trivial torsor, then Z = BGk for some B ∈Z(k). The equivalent
diﬀerential equation v′ = ˜Av, obtained by the substitution y = Bv, has the
property that the ideal ˜q ⊂k[Zi,j,
1
det] of Gk, where (Xi,j) = B(Zi,j), is a
maximal diﬀerential ideal.
Let zi,j denote the image of Zi,j in the Picard-
Vessiot ring k[Zi,j,
1
det]/˜q of v′ = ˜Av. Then F := (zi,j) is a fundamental matrix
and lies in G(L), where L is the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld. As in the proof of part
(1) one veriﬁes that F + ϵF ′ ∈G(L[ϵ]).
It follows that ˜A = F −1F ′ lies in
g(L) ∩Mn(k) = g(k).
2
For a diﬀerential ﬁeld which is a C1-ﬁeld, there is a (partial) converse of
1.31. Examples of such ﬁelds are C(z), C((z)) and C({z}) for any algebraically
closed ﬁeld C.
Corollary 1.32 Let the diﬀerential ﬁeld k be a C1-ﬁeld. Suppose that the dif-
ferential Galois group G of the equation y′ = Ay over k is connected. Let g be
the Lie algebra of G. Let a connected algebraic group H ⊃G with Lie algebra
h be given such that A ∈h(k). Then there exists B ∈H(k) such that the equiv-
alent diﬀerential equation f ′ = ˜Af, with y = Bf and ˜A = B−1AB −B−1B′,
satisﬁes ˜A ∈g(k).
Proof.
The assumptions that G is connected and k is a C1-ﬁeld imply that Z
is a trivial torsor. Apply now 1.31.
2
Remarks 1.33
(1) The condition that G is connected is necessary for 1.32. Indeed, consider
the case H = G. If ˜A ∈h(k) = g(k) can be found, then by
1.31 part (1),
G ⊂Ho and thus G = Go.
(2) We recall that an algebraic Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra Mn(C) of
GLn(C) is the Lie algebra of an algebraic subgroup of GLn(C). Assume that
k is a C1-ﬁeld and that the diﬀerential Galois group of y′ = Ay is connected.
Let h ⊂Mn(C) be a minimal algebraic Lie subalgebra such that there exists
an equivalent equation v′ = ˜Av with ˜A ∈h(k). Then, by
1.32, h is the Lie
algebra of the diﬀerential Galois group. This observation can be used to ﬁnd
the diﬀerential Galois group or to prove that a proposed group is the diﬀerential
Galois group.

CHAPTER 1. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY
Proposition 1.34 The Galois Correspondence
Let y′ = Ay be a diﬀerential equation over k with Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld L and
write G := Gal(L/k). Consider the two sets
S := the closed subgroups of G and
L:= the diﬀerential subﬁelds M of L, containing k.
Deﬁne α : S →L by α(H) = LH, the subﬁeld of L consisting of the H-invariant
elements. Deﬁne β : L →S by β(M) = Gal(L/M), which is the subgroup of G
consisting of the M-linear diﬀerential automorphisms. Then
1. The maps α and β are inverses of each other.
2. The subgroup H ∈S is a normal subgroup of G if and only if M = LH
is, as a set, invariant under G. If H ∈S is normal then the canonical
map G →Gal(M/k) is surjective and has kernel H. Moreover M is a
Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for some linear diﬀerential equation over k.
3. Let Go denote the identity component of G. Then LGo ⊃k is a ﬁnite
Galois extension with Galois group G/Go and is the algebraic closure of k
in L.
Proof.
Since the elements of G commute with the derivation, LH is a diﬀer-
ential subﬁeld of L. One observes that the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of the equation
y′ = Ay over M is again L and thus β(M) = Gal(L/M) is its diﬀerential Galois
group. In particular β(M) is a closed subgroup of G and belongs to S.
1. For M ∈L one has αβ(M) = LGal(L/M). By applying Theorem 1.27 to the
Picard-Vessiot extension L/M for y′ = Ay over M, one sees that the last ﬁeld
is equal to M.
Let H ⊂G be a closed subgroup. The inclusion H ⊂H1 := Gal(L/LH) =
βα(H) is obvious. One applies Corollary 1.30 with G replaced by H1 and k
replaced by LH = LH1. We conclude that H = H1.
2. Assume that M = LH is left invariant by all elements of G. One can then
deﬁne a map G →Gal(M/k) by restricting any σ ∈G to M. The kernel of
this map is H, so H is normal in G. Furthermore, this map deﬁnes an injective
homomorphism of the group G/H into Gal(M/k). To show that this map is
surjective, one needs to show that any diﬀerential automorphism of M over k
extends to a diﬀerential automorphism of L over k. Consider, more generally,
M ∈L and a k-homomorphism of diﬀerential ﬁelds ψ : M →L. The Picard-
Vessiot ﬁeld for y′ = Ay over M is L. The Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for y′ = ψ(A)y
(note that ψ(A) = A) over ψ(M) is also L. The unicity of the Picard-Vessiot
ﬁeld yields a k-isomorphism of diﬀerential ﬁelds ˜ψ : L →L, extending ψ.
Now assume that there is an element τ ∈G such that τ(M) ̸= M. The
Galois group of L over τ(M) is τHτ −1.
Since τ(M) ̸= M, part (1) of the
proposition implies that τHτ −1 ̸= H. Therefore H is not normal in G.
It is more diﬃcult to see that M is a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for some linear
diﬀerential equation over K and we postpone the proof of this fact to the next
section (see Corollary 1.40).

1.4. THE DIFFERENTIAL GALOIS GROUP

3. G/Go is a ﬁnite group. The property that (LGo)G/Go = k together with
the Galois theory of algebraic extensions (c.f., [169], VII, §1, Artin’s Theorem),
implies that LGo ⊃k is a Galois extension with Galois group G/Go. If u is
algebraic over k, then the orbit of u under the action of G is ﬁnite. Therefore,
the group Aut(L/k(u)) is an algebraic subgroup of G of ﬁnite index.
This
implies that Go ⊂Aut(L/k(u)) and so k(u) ⊂LGo.

Consider the diﬀerential ﬁeld C(z) with C algebraically closed and of char-
acteristic 0 and derivation

form y′′ = ry. The Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld will be denoted by L and the diﬀerential
Galois group will be denoted by G. The following exercise will show how one
can determine in many cases the Galois group of such an equation. A fuller
treatment is given in [166] and [271, 272, 273].
The rather short list of the algebraic subgroups (up to conjugation) of SL2(C)
is the following (see for instance [166]):

| a ∈C∗, b ∈C}.
(ii) Irreducible and imprimitive groups G, i.e., there is no G-invariant line but
there is a pair of lines permuted by G.
In other terms G is an irreducible
subgroup of the inﬁnite dihedral group D∞, consisting of all A ∈SL2(C) such
that A permutes the two lines C(1, 0), C(0, 1) in C2.
(iii) Three ﬁnite primitive (i.e., irreducible but not imprimitive) groups: the
tetrahedral, the octahedral and the icosahedral group.
(iv) Sl2(C).

(a) Using Exercise 1.35.5, show that the Galois group of y′′ = ry is a subgroup
of SL2(C).
(b) Associated to the equation y′′ = ry there is the non-linear Riccati equation
u′ + u2 = r. Let L be the Picard-Vessiot extension of k corresponding to this
equation and let V ⊂L denote the vector space of solutions of y′′ = ry. Then
V is a two-dimensional vector space over C. The group G acts on V . Show that
u ∈L is a solution of the Riccati equation u′ + u2 = r if and only if u = y′
y for
some y ∈V, y ̸= 0.
(c) Show that G is reducible if and only if the Riccati equation has a solution

ring. Prove that R is generated over C(z) by the entries of a fundamental matrix
for the equation.
(c) Determine the diﬀerential Galois group G of the equation.
(d) Verify that the Lie algebra of G is equal to the Lie algebra of the K-linear
derivations D : R →R that commute with ′ .
(e) What can one say about the solutions of the equation?
3. Liouville’s diﬀerential equation y′′ = ry with r ∈C[z] \ C.
(a) Show that the Galois group of this equation is connected. Hint: Standard
existence theorems imply that there are two linearly independent entire solutions
y1, y2 of y′′ = ry. Show that the subﬁeld K = C(z, y1, y2, y′

2) of the ﬁeld of
meromorphic functions on C, is a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for the equation. Show
that if u ∈K is algebraic over C(z), then u is meromorphic on the Riemann
Sphere and so in C(z). Deduce that G = Go.
(b) Suppose that r ∈C[z] has odd degree. Prove that the Riccati equation has
no solution u ∈C(z). Hint: Expand u at z = ∞and ﬁnd a contradiction.
(c) Suppose again that r ∈C[z] has odd degree. Prove that G = SL2(C) and
give an explicit description of the Picard-Vessiot ring.
(d) Consider the equation y′′ = (z2+1)y. Find a solution u ∈C(z) of the Riccati
equation. Construct the Picard-Vessiot ring and calculate the diﬀerential Galois
group. Hint: Consider ﬁrst the equation y′ = uy. A solution y1 ̸= 0 is also a
solution of y′′
1 = (z2+1)y1. Find a second solution y2 by “variation of constants”.
4. Liouville’s theorem (1841) for y′′ = ry with r ∈C[z] \ C
Prove the following slightly deformed version of Liouville’s theorem:
Consider the diﬀerential equation y′′ = ry with r ∈C[z] \ C. The diﬀerential
Galois group of this equation (over the diﬀerential ﬁeld C(z)) is equal to SL2(C)
unless r has even degree 2n and there are polynomials v, F with deg v = n such
that u := v + F ′
F is a solution of the Riccati equation u′ + u2 = r.
In the last case, the diﬀerential Galois group is conjugate to the group
{

|a ∈C∗, b ∈C}.
Hints:
(i) Use part 3. of the exercise and the classiﬁcation of the Zariski closed sub-
groups of SL2(C), to prove that the diﬀerential Galois group can only be (up

Theorem 1.28 allows us to identify the Picard-Vessiot ring inside the Picard-
Vessiot ﬁeld. This is the result of the following Corollary (see [34], [182], [266]).
Corollary 1.38 Let y′ = Ay be a diﬀerential equation over k with Picard-
Vessiot ﬁeld L, diﬀerential Galois group G and Picard-Vessiot ring R ⊂L. The
following properties of f ∈L are equivalent.
(1) f ∈R.
(2) The C-vector space < Gf >, spanned by the orbit Gf := {g(f)| g ∈G} has
ﬁnite dimension m over C.
(3) The k-vector space < f, f ′, f ′′, . . . > spanned by f and all its derivatives has
ﬁnite dimension m over k.
Proof.
(1)⇒(2).
By Theorem 1.28, there is a ﬁnite extension ˜k ⊃k such
that ˜k ⊗k R ∼= ˜k ⊗C C[G]. Here C[G] denotes the coordinate ring of G. It is
well known, see [141], that the G-orbit of any element in C[G] spans a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space over C. This property is inherited by ˜k ⊗C C[G] and
also by R.
(2)⇒(3). Choose a basis v1, . . . , vm of < Gf > over C. There is a unique scalar
diﬀerential equation P(y) = y(m) + am−1y(m−1) + · · · + a1y(1) + a0y with all
ai ∈L such that P(vi) = 0 for all i (see for instance the proof of Lemma 1.12).
Then < Gf > is the solution space of P. The G-invariance of this space implies
that all ai ∈LG = k. From P(f) = 0 it follows that < f, f ′, f ′′, · · · > has
dimension ≤m over k. Let Q be the monic scalar equation of minimal degree
n ≤m over k such that Q(f) = 0. The solution space of Q in L contains f and
the m-dimensional C-vector space < Gf >. Hence m = n.
(3)⇒(1). Suppose that W =< f, f ′, f ′′, · · · > has dimension m over k. Then
f is a solution of a monic linear scalar diﬀerential equation P over k of order
m. Consider the nonzero ideal I ⊂R consisting of the elements a ∈R such
that aW ⊂R. For a ∈I and w ∈W, one has a′w = (aw)′ −aw′. Since both
R and W are invariant under diﬀerentiation, one ﬁnds a′w ∈R. Thus I is a
diﬀerential ideal. Now R is a simple diﬀerential ring and therefore I = R. This
proves that f ∈R.

1.4. THE DIFFERENTIAL GALOIS GROUP

Exercise 1.39 Solutions of diﬀerential equations and their reciprocals.
k is a diﬀerential ﬁeld with algebraically closed ﬁeld of constants C. Let R ⊃k
be a Picard-Vessiot ring with ﬁeld of fractions L. The goal of this exercise is to
show:
Let f ∈L∗. Then both f and f −1 satisfy a scalar linear diﬀerential equation
over k if and only if f ′
f is algebraic over k
For the proof one needs a result of Rosenlicht [248] (see also [180], [266])
which states:
Let G is a connected linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed ﬁeld
K and let f ∈K[G] (i.e., the coordinate ring of G) be an invertible element
such that f(1) = 1. Then f is a character, i.e., f(g1g2) = f(g1)f(g2) for all
g1, g2 ∈G.
(1) Show that it suﬃces to consider the case where k is algebraically closed.
Hint: Replace k by its algebraic closure k and L by kL.
(2) Prove that f ′
f ∈k implies that f, f −1 ∈R.
(3) Show that R ∼= k ⊗C C[G] and that G is connected.
(4) Suppose that f is an invertible element of R. Show that f considered as an
element of k ⊗C C[G] has the form b · χ, where χ : Gk →k∗is a character and
b ∈k∗. Conclude that σ(f) = χ(σ)f for any σ ∈G.
(5) Prove that any character χ : Gk →k∗has the property χ(σ) ∈C∗for all
σ ∈G. Hint: Two proofs are possible. The ﬁrst one shows that any character
of Gk comes from a character of G. We suggest a second proof. Any character
χ belongs to R and satisﬁes, according to Corollary 1.38, a linear diﬀerential
equation over k. Let y(m) + am−1y(m−1) + · · · + a1y(y) + a0y be the diﬀerential
equation of minimal degree over k, satisﬁed by χ. Fix σ ∈G and deﬁne a ∈k∗
by σ(χ) = aχ. Since σ commutes with the diﬀerentiation, the same equation
is the scalar linear diﬀerential equation of minimal degree over k satisﬁed by
σ(χ) = aχ. Prove that am−1 = m a′
a + am−1 and conclude that a ∈C∗.
(6) Prove that f ′
f ∈k.
(7) Show that sin z satisﬁes a linear diﬀerential equation over C(z) and that
1
sin z does not. Hint: A periodic function cannot be algebraic over C(z) (why?).
The main result of this exercise was ﬁrst proved in [123]. See also [266] and
[278].
2
We now use Theorem 1.28 to give a proof that a normal subgroup corre-
sponds to a subﬁeld that is also a Picard-Vessiot extension, thereby ﬁnishing
the proof of Proposition 1.34.

32
CHAPTER 1. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY
Corollary 1.40 Let L ⊃k be the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of the equation y′ = Ay
over k. Let G := Gal(L/k) be the diﬀerential Galois group of the equation and
let H ⊂G be a closed normal subgroup. Then M = LH is a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld
for some linear diﬀerential equation over k.
Proof.
This proof depends on the following three facts from the theory of
linear algebraic groups.
Let G be a linear algebraic group and H a Zariski
closed normal subgroup.
1. The G-orbit of any element f ∈C[G] spans a ﬁnite dimensional C-vector
space.
2. The group G/H has a structure of an aﬃne group and its coordinate ring
C[G/H] is isomorphic to the ring of invariants C[G]H.
3. The two rings Qt(C[G])H and Qt(O[G]H) are naturally isomorphic.
These facts can be found in [141], §11, 12, and [36]. Let L be the quotient
ﬁeld of the Picard-Vessiot ring R. Let ˜k be a ﬁnite Galois extension of k with
(ordinary) Galois group U such that the torsor corresponding to R becomes
trivial over ˜k. This means that ˜k⊗k R ≃˜k⊗C C[G]. Note that U acts on ˜k⊗k R
by acting on the left factor as the Galois group and on the right factor as the
identity. The group G acts on ˜k ⊗k R ≃˜k ⊗C C[G] by acting trivially on the
left factor and acting on R via the Galois action (or equivalently, on C[G] via
the natural action of G on its coordinate ring). Using the above facts, we have
that ˜k ⊗k RH ≃˜k ⊗C C[G/H] and that ˜k ⊗k LH is equal to ˜k ⊗C Qt(C[G]H).
Since C[G/H] is a ﬁnitely generated C-algebra, there exist r1, . . . , rm ∈RH
that generate ˜k ⊗k RH as a ˜k-algebra. Taking invariants under U, one ﬁnds
that RH is a ﬁnitely generated k-algebra whose ﬁeld of fractions is LH. We
may furthermore assume that that RH is generated by a basis y1, . . . , yn of a
ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space that is G/H-invariant. Lemma 1.12 implies
that the wronskian matrix W = W(y1, . . . , yn) is invertible. Furthermore, the
matrix A = W ′W −1 is left invariant by G/H and so has entries in k. Since the
constants of LH are C and LH is generated by a fundamental set of solutions
of the linear diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay, Proposition 1.22 implies that LH is
a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld.

Exercises 1.41 Let G be a connected solvable linear algebraic group. In this
exercise the fact that any G-torsor over k is trivial, will be used. For this, see
the comments following Lemma A.51.
1. Picard-Vessiot extensions with Galois group (Ga)r.

Ki−1(ti) with ti transcendental over Ki−1 and either t′
i ∈Ki−1 or t′
i/ti ∈Ki−1.
Hint: Produce a tower of closed subgroups {1} = G0 ⊂G1 ⊂· · · ⊂Go ⊂G,
where Go be the identity component of the Galois group G and each Gi is a
normal subgroup of Gi+1 such that Gi+1/Gi is either Ga or Gm. (Compare
Chapter 17, Exercise 7 and Theorem 19.3 of [141]). Apply Corollary 1.40.
In the next section 1.5, an elementary proof of the above statement will be
given, which does not use Theorem 1.28.

1.5
Liouvillian Extensions
In this section we show how one can formalize the notion of solving a linear
diﬀerential equation in “ﬁnite terms”, that is solving in terms of algebraic com-
binations and iterations of exponentials and integrals, and give a Galois theoretic
characterization of this property.
In classical Galois theory, one formalizes the notion of solving a polynomial
equation in terms of radicals by using towers of ﬁelds. A similar approach will
be taken here.
Deﬁnition 1.42 The diﬀerential ﬁeld k is supposed to have an algebraically
closed ﬁeld of constants C. An extension K ⊃k of diﬀerential ﬁelds is called a
liouvillian extension of k if the ﬁeld of constants of K is C and if there exists
a tower of ﬁelds k = K0 ⊂K1 ⊂. . . ⊂Kn = K such that Ki = Ki−1(ti) for
i = 1, . . . , n, where either
1. t′
i ∈Ki−1, that is ti is an integral (of an element of Ki−1), or
2. ti ̸= 0 and t′
i/ti ∈Ki−1, that is ti is an exponential (of an integral of an
element of Ki−1), or
3. ti is algebraic over Ki−1.
If K is a liouvillian extension of k and each of the ti is an integral (resp. exponen-
tial), we say that K is an extension by integrals (resp. extension by exponentials)
of k.
2
The main result of this section is
Theorem 1.43 Let K be a Picard-Vessiot extension of k with diﬀerential Ga-
lois group G. The following are equivalent:

34
CHAPTER 1. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY
(1) Go is a solvable group.
(2) K is a liouvillian extension of k.
(3) K is contained in a liouvillian extension of k.
Proof.
(1)⇒(2). (In fact a stronger statement follows from Exercise 1.41.3
but we present here a more elementary proof, not depending on the theory of
torsors, of this weaker statement).
Let K be the Picard-Vessiot extension of a scalar diﬀerential equation L(y) = 0
of order n over k. Let G be the diﬀerential Galois group of the equation and Go
be its identity component. Let V ⊂K be the solution space of L. Let k0 be the
ﬁxed ﬁeld of Go. Then K is the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for the equation L(y) = 0
over k0 and its Galois group is Go. The Lie-Kolchin Theorem (Theorem A.46)
implies that V has a basis y1, . . . , yn over C such that Go ⊂GL(V ) consists of
upper triangular matrices w.r.t. the basis y1, . . . , yn. We will use induction on
the order n of L and on the dimension of Go.
Suppose that y1 ̸∈k0. For any σ ∈Go, there is a constant c(σ) ∈C∗with
σy1 = c(σ)y1. Hence y′
1
y1 ∈k0. Now K ⊃k0(y1) is the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for
the equation L(y) = 0 over k0(y1) and its diﬀerential Galois group is a proper
subgroup of Go. By induction K ⊃k0(y1) is a liouvillian extension and so is
K ⊃k.
Suppose that y1 ∈k0. Let L(y) = 0 have the form any(n) + · · · + a0y = 0.
Then L(yy1) = bny(n) + · · · + b1y(1) + b0y. The term b0 is zero since L(y1) = 0.
Consider the scalar diﬀerential equation M(f) = bnf (n−1) + · · · + b1f = 0. Its
solution space in K is C( y2
y1 )′ + · · · + C( yn
y1 )′. Hence the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld ˜K
of M lies in K and its diﬀerential Galois group is a connected solvable group.
By induction k ⊂˜K is a liouvillian extension. Moreover K = ˜K(t2, . . . , tn) and
t′
i = ( yi
y1 )′ for i = 2, . . . , n. Thus K ⊃˜K is liouvillian and so is K ⊃k.
(3)⇒(1). Let M = k(t1, . . . , tm) be a liouvillian extension of k containing K.
We shall show that Go is solvable using induction on m.
The subﬁeld K(t1) of M is the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of the equation L(y) = 0
over k(t1). Indeed, K(t1) is generated over k(t1) by the solutions y of L(y) = 0
and their derivatives. The diﬀerential Galois group H = Gal(K(t1)/k(t1)) is a
closed subgroup of G. The ﬁeld of invariants KH = K(t1)H ∩K = k(t1) ∩K.
Since K is also the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of the equation L(y) = 0 over k(t1) ∩K,
one has that H = Gal(K/k(t1) ∩K). By induction Ho is solvable.
If k(t1) ∩K = k, then H = G and we are done. Suppose that k(t1) ∩K ̸= k.
We now deal with the three possibilities for t1. If t1 is algebraic over k, then
k(t1) ∩K is algebraic over k and lies in the ﬁxed ﬁeld KGo. Hence Ho = Go
and we are done.
Suppose that t1 is transcendental over k and that k(t1)∩K ̸= k. If t′
1 = a ∈k∗,
then k(t1) ⊃k has diﬀerential Galois group Ga,C. This group has only trivial
algebraic subgroups and so k(t1) ⊂K. The equation t′
1 = a ∈k∗, shows that
k(t1) is set wise invariant under G = Gal(K/k). Thus there is an exact sequence

1.5. LIOUVILLIAN EXTENSIONS
35
of algebraic groups
1 →Gal(K/k(t1)) →Gal(K/k) →Gal(k(t1)/k) →1.
From Ho is solvable and Gal(k(t1)/k) = Ga,C one easily deduces that Go is
solvable.
If t′
1 = at1 with a ∈k∗, then Gal(k(t1)/k) = Gm,C.
The only non trivial
closed subgroups of Gm,C = C∗are the ﬁnite groups of roots of unity. Hence
k(t1) ∩K = k(td
1) for some integer d ≥1. As above, this yields that Go is
solvable.

Exercise 1.44 Using Exercise A.44, modify the above proof to show that if G
is a torus, then K can be embedded in an extension by exponentials. (This can
also be deduced from Exercise 1.41.)
2
In general, one can detect from the Galois group if a linear diﬀerential equa-
tion can be solved in terms of only integrals or only exponentials or only al-
gebraics or in any combination of these. We refer to Kolchin’s original paper
[160] or [161] for a discussion of this. Finally, using the fact that a connected
solvable group can be written as a semi-direct product of a unipotent group U
and a torus T one can show:
If the identity component of the Galois group of
a Picard-Vessiot extension K of k is solvable, then there is a chain of subﬁelds
k = K0 ⊂K1 ⊂· · · ⊂Kn = K such that Ki = Ki−1(ti) where
1. t1 is algebraic over k,
2. for i = 2, . . . , n −m, m = dim U, ti is transcendental over Ki−1 and
t′
i/ti ∈Ki−1,
3. for i = n −m + 1, . . . , n, ti is transcendental over Ki−1 and t′
i ∈Ki−1.
We refer to [182], Proposition 6.7, for a proof of this result.
Theorem 1.43 describes the Galois groups of linear diﬀerential equations, all
of whose solutions are liouvillian. It will be useful to discuss the case when only
some of the solutions are liouvillian.
Proposition 1.45 Let L(y) = 0 be scalar diﬀerential equation with coeﬃcients
in k and Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld K. Suppose that L(y) = 0 has a nonzero solution
in some liouvillian extension of k. Then there is a solution y ∈K, y ̸= 0 of
L(y) = 0 such that y′
y is algebraic over k.
Proof.
Let k(t1, . . . , tn) be a liouvillian extension of k and let y ∈k(t1, . . . , tn),
y ̸= 0 satisfy L(y) = 0. We will show the statement by induction on n.
Let n = 1 and t1 be algebraic over k. Then y and y′
y are algebraic over k.
Suppose that t1 is transcendental over k and t′
1 = a ∈k∗. The element y satisﬁes

36
CHAPTER 1. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY
a diﬀerential equation over k and lies therefore in the Picard-Vessiot ring k[t1]
(see Corollary 1.38). The elements σ ∈Gal(k(t1)/k) have the form σ(t1) = t1+c
(with arbitrary c ∈C). Further σ(y) and σ(y) −y are also solutions of L. One
concludes that L has a nonzero solution in k itself.
Suppose that t1 is transcendental over k and that t′
1 = at1 for some a ∈k∗.
Then y lies in the Picard-Vessiot ring k[t1, t−1
1 ]. The elements σ ∈Gal(k(t1)/k)
act by σ(t1) = ct1 with c ∈C∗arbitrary. Also σ(y) −dy, with σ ∈Gal(k(t1)/k)
and d ∈C are solutions of L. It follows that k(t1) contains a solution of L of
the form y = btd
1 with b ∈k∗and d ∈Z. For such a y, one has y′
y ∈k.
Suppose that y ∈k(t1, . . . , tn+1), y ̸= 0 is a solution of L. The induction
hypothesis implies that the algebraic closure k(t), with t = t1, contains solutions
of the Riccati equation of L. It t is algebraic over k, then we are done.
If t is transcendental over k, then one considers, as in the last part of the proof
of Theorem 1.43, the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of L over k(t) which is denoted by
Kk(t) or K(t). Further Kk(t) denotes the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of L over k(t).
Let V ⊂K denote the solution space of L (in K and also in Kk(t)). Let a
y ∈V, y ̸= 0 be given such that y′
y is algebraic over k(t). For any σ ∈Gal(K/k)
the element σ(y) has the same property. Choose σ1, . . . , σs ∈Gal(K/k), with s
maximal, such that the elements σ1y, . . . , σsy ∈V are linearly independent over
C. The vector space W ⊂V spanned by σ1y, . . . , σsy is clearly invariant under
the action of Gal(K/k). Let f (s)+as−1f (s−1)+· · ·+a0f by the unique diﬀerential
equation M over K with M(σiy) = 0 for i = 1, . . . , s. For any σ ∈Gal(K/k),
the transformed equation σM has the same space W as solution space. Hence
σM = M and we conclude that M has coeﬃcients in k. We replace now L
by M. Consider the liouvillian ﬁeld extension k(t, u1, . . . , us, σ1y, . . . , σsy) ⊂
Kk(t) of k, where the ui := σiy′
σiy are algebraic over k(t). This ﬁeld contains
the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of the equation of M over k. By Theorem 1.43, the
diﬀerential Galois group H of M over k has the property that Ho is solvable.
Let f ∈W f ̸= 0 be an eigenvector for Ho. Then f ′
f is invariant under Ho and
is therefore algebraic over k. Since W ⊂V , also L(f) = 0.
2
Exercise 1.46 Show that the equation y′′′ + zy = 0 has no nonzero solutions
liouvillian over C(z). Hint: As in Exercise 1.36(3), show that the Galois group
of this equation is connected. If exp(

u) is a solution of y′′′ + zy = 0 then
u satisﬁes u′′ + 3uu′ + u3 + z = 0. By expanding at ∞, show that this latter
equation has no nonzero solution in C(z).

Exercises 1.47 The “normality” of a Picard-Vessiot extension.
(1) In the classical Galois theory a ﬁnite extension K ⊃k is called normal if
every irreducible polynomial over k which has one root in K has all its roots in
K. Prove the following analogous property for Picard-Vessiot ﬁelds:
Suppose that K ⊃k is a Picard-Vessiot extension and let f ∈K be a solution
of an irreducible scalar diﬀerential equation P over k of order m. Show that the

1.5. LIOUVILLIAN EXTENSIONS
37
solution space of P in K has dimension m (over the ﬁeld of constants C of k).
We note that some results of Chapter 2 are needed for this exercise, namely the
deﬁnition of “irreducible operator” and Exercise 2.4 part 3.
Liouvillian extensions are very diﬀerent from Picard-Vessiot extensions.
(2) Consider the liouvillian extension k(t, f) of k deﬁned by: t is transcendental
over k and t′
t ∈k∗. Further f is algebraic over k(t) with equation f 2 = 1 −t2.
Show that k(t, f) is not a diﬀerential subﬁeld of a Picard-Vessiot extension of
k.
Hint: Let k ⊂k(t, f) ⊂K with K/k a Picard-Vessiot extension. For every
c ∈C∗there exists an element σc ∈Gal(K/k) such that σct = ct. Now σc(f)2 =
1 −c2t2. Show that the algebraic ﬁeld extension of k(t) generated by all σc(f)
is inﬁnite. Now use that K/k(t) is also a Picard-Vessiot extension.

Chapter 2
Diﬀerential Operators and
Diﬀerential Modules
2.1
The Ring D = k[∂] of Diﬀerential Operators
In this chapter k is a diﬀerential ﬁeld such that its subﬁeld of constants C is
diﬀerent from k and has characteristic 0. The skew (i.e., noncommutative) ring
D := k[∂] consists of all expressions L := an∂n+· · ·+a1∂+a0 with n ∈Z, n ≥0
and all ai ∈k. These elements L are called diﬀerential operators. The degree
deg L of L above is m if am ̸= 0 and ai = 0 for i > m. In case L = 0 we deﬁne
the degree to be −∞. The addition in D is obvious. The multiplication in D is
completely determined by the prescribed rule ∂a = a∂+ a′. Since there exists
an element a ∈k with a′ ̸= 0, the ring D is not commutative. One calls D the
ring of linear diﬀerential operators with coeﬃcients in k.
A diﬀerential operator L = an∂n+· · ·+a1∂+a0 acts on k and on diﬀerential
extensions of k, with the interpretation ∂(y) := y′. Thus the equation L(y) = 0
has the same meaning as the scalar diﬀerential equation any(n) + · · · + a1y(1) +
a0y = 0. In connection with this one sometimes uses the expression order of L,
instead of the degree of L.
The ring of diﬀerential operators shares many properties with the ordinary
polynomial ring in one variable over k.
Lemma 2.1 For L1, L2 ∈D with L1 ̸= 0, there are unique diﬀerential operators
Q, R ∈D such that L2 = QL1 + R and deg R < deg L1.
The proof is not diﬀerent from the usual division with remainder for the ordi-
nary polynomial ring over k. The version where left and right are interchanged is
equally valid. An interesting way to interchange left and right is provided by the
“involution” i : L →L∗of D deﬁned by the formula i( ai∂i) = (−1)i∂iai.
39

40
CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
The operator L∗is often called the formal adjoint of L.
Exercise 2.2 The term “involution” means that i is an additive bijection, i2 =
id and i(L1L2) = i(L2)i(L1) for all L1, L2 ∈D. Prove that i, as deﬁned above,
has these properties. Hint: Let k[∂]⋆denote the additive group k[∂] made into a
ring by the opposite multiplication given by the formula L1 ⋆L2 = L2L1. Show
that k[∂]⋆is also a skew polynomial ring over the ﬁeld k and with variable −∂.
Observe that (−∂) ⋆a = a ⋆(−∂) + a′.
2
Corollary 2.3 For any left ideal I ⊂k[∂] there exists an L1 ∈k[∂] such that
I = k[∂]L1. Similarly, for any right ideal J ⊂k[∂] there exists an L2 ∈k[∂]
such that J = L2k[∂].
From these results one can deﬁne the Least Common Left Multiple,
LCLM(L1, L2), of L1, L2 ∈k[∂] as the unique monic generator of k[∂]L1∩k[∂]L2
and the Greatest Common Left Divisor, GCLD(L1, L2), of L1, L2 ∈k[∂] as the
unique monic generator of L1k[∂] + L2k[∂] . The Least Common Right Multiple
of L1, L2 ∈k[∂], LCRM(L1, L2) and the Greatest Common Right Divisor
of
L1, L2 ∈k[∂], GCRD(L1, L2) can be deﬁned similarly. We note that a modiﬁed
version of the Euclidean Algorithm can be used to ﬁnd the GCLD(L1, L2) and
the GCRD(L1, L2).
Exercises 2.4 The ring k[∂]
1.
Show that for any nonzero operators L1, L2 ∈k[∂], with deg(L1) = n1,
deg(L2) = n2 we have that deg(L1L2 −L2L1) < n1 + n2. Show that k[∂] has
no two-sided ideals other than (0) and k[∂].
2. Let M be a D = k[∂]-submodule of the free left module F := Dn. Show
that F has a free basis e1, . . . , en over D such that M is generated by elements
a1e1, . . . , anen for suitable a1, . . . , an ∈D. Conclude that M is also a free D-
module. Hints:
(a) For any element f = (f1, . . . , fn) ∈F there is a free basis e1, . . . , en of F
such that f = cen with c ∈D such that Dc = Df1 + · · · + Dfn.
(b) Choose m = (b1, . . . , bn) ∈M such that the degree of the c ∈D with
Dc = Db1 + · · · + Dbn is minimal. Choose a new basis, called e1, . . . , en of F
such that m = cen. Prove that M is the direct sum of M ∩(De1 ⊕· · ·⊕Den−1)
and Dcen.
(c) Use induction to ﬁnish the proof.
3. Let L1, L2 ∈k[∂] with deg(L1) = n1, deg(L2) = n2. Let K be a diﬀerential
extension of k having the same constants C as k and let SolnK(Li) denote the
C-space of solutions of Li(y) = 0 in K. Assume that dimC(SolnK(L2)) = n2.
Show that:
(a) Suppose that every solution in K of L2(y) = 0 is a solution of L1(y) = 0.
Then there exists a Q ∈k[∂] such that L1 = QL2.
(b) Suppose that L1 divides L2 on the right, then SolnK(L1) ⊂SolnK(L2) and
dimC(SolnK(L1)) = n1.

Lemma 2.5 Finitely generated left k[∂]-modules.
Every ﬁnitely generated left k[∂]-module is isomorphic to a ﬁnite direct sum
⊕Mi, where each Mi is isomorphic to either k[∂] or k[∂]/k[∂]L for some L ∈k[∂]
with deg L > 0.
Proof.
Let M be a ﬁnitely generated left k[∂]-module. Then there is a sur-
jective homomorphism φ : k[∂]n →M of k[∂]-modules. The kernel of φ is a
submodule of the free module k[∂]n. Exercises 2.4 part 2. applied to ker(φ)
yields the required direct sum decomposition of M.
2
Observation 2.6 A diﬀerential module M over k is the same object as a left
k[∂]-module such that dimk M < ∞.
Exercise 2.7 Let y′ = Ay be a matrix diﬀerential equation over k of dimension
n with corresponding diﬀerential module M. Show that the following properties
are equivalent:
(1) There is a fundamental matrix F for y′ = Ay with coeﬃcients in k.
(2) dimC ker(∂, M) = n.
(3) M is a direct sum of copies of 1k, where 1k denotes the 1-dimensional
diﬀerential module ke with ∂e = 0.
A diﬀerential module M over k is called trivial if the equivalent properties (2)
and (3) hold for M. Assume now that C is algebraically closed. Prove that M
is a trivial diﬀerential module if and only if the diﬀerential Galois group of M
is {1}.
2
Intermezzo on multilinear algebra.
Let F be any ﬁeld.
For vector spaces of ﬁnite dimension over F there are
“constructions of linear algebra” which are used very often in connection with
diﬀerential modules.
Apart from the well known “constructions” direct sum
V1 ⊕V2 of two vector spaces, subspace W ⊂V , quotient space V/W, dual space
V ∗of V , there are the less elementary constructions:
The tensor product V ⊗F W (or simply V ⊗W) of two vector spaces. Although
we have already used this construction many times, we recall its categorical
deﬁnition. A bilinear map b : V × W →Z (with Z any vector space over F) is
a map (v, w) →b(v, w) ∈Z which is linear in v and w separately. The tensor
product (t, V ⊗W) is deﬁned by t : V × W →V ⊗W is a bilinear map such
that there exists for each bilinear map b : V × W →Z a unique linear map
ℓ: V ⊗W →Z with ℓ◦t = b. The elements t(v, w) are denoted by v ⊗w. It
is easily seen that bases {v1, . . . , vn} of V and {w1, . . . , wm} of W give rise to a
basis {vi ⊗wj}i=1,...,n;j=1,...,m of V ⊗W. The tensor product of several vector
spaces V1 ⊗· · ·⊗Vs can be deﬁned in a similar way by multilinear maps. A basis
of this tensor product can be obtained in a similar way from bases for every Vi.
The vector space of the homomorphisms Hom(V, W) consist of the F-linear
maps ℓ: V →W. Its structure as an F-vector space is given by (ℓ1 + ℓ2)(v) :=

42
CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
ℓ1(v)+ℓ2(v) and (fℓ)(v) := fℓ(v). There is a natural isomorphism α : V ∗⊗W →
Hom(V, W), given by the formula α(ℓ⊗w)(v) := ℓ(v) · w.
The symmetric powers symdV of a vector space V . Consider the d-fold tensor
product V ⊗· · ·⊗V and its subspace W generated by the vectors (v1⊗· · ·⊗vd)−
(vπ(1)⊗· · ·⊗vπ(d)), with v1, . . . , vd ∈V and π ∈Sd, the group of all permutations
on {1, . . ., d}. Then symdV is deﬁned as the quotient space (V ⊗· · · ⊗V )/W.
The notation for the elements of symdV is often the same as for the elements of
V ⊗· · · ⊗V , namely ﬁnite sums of expressions v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vd. For the symmetric
powers, one has (by deﬁnition) v1 ⊗· · ·⊗vd = vπ(1) ⊗· · ·⊗vπ(d) for any π ∈Sd.
Sometimes one omits the tensor product in the notation for the elements in the
symmetric powers. Thus v1v2 · · · vd is an element of symdV . Let {v1, . . . , vn} be
a basis of V , then {va1
1 va2
2 · · · van
n | all ai ≥0 and  ai = d} is a basis of symdV .
One extends this deﬁnition by sym1V = V and sym0V = F.
The exterior powers ΛdV . One considers again the tensor product V ⊗· · · ⊗V
of d copies of V . Let W be the subspace of this tensor product generated by
the expressions v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vd, where there are (at least) two indices i ̸= j with
vi = vj. Then ΛdV is deﬁned as the quotient space (V ⊗· · ·⊗V )/W. The image
of the element v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vd in ΛdV is denoted by v1 ∧· · · ∧vd. If {v1, . . . , vn} is
a basis of V , then the collection {vi1 ∧· · · ∧vid| 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < id ≤n} is a
basis of ΛdV . In particular ΛdV = 0 if d > n and ΛnV ∼= F. This isomorphism
is made explicit by choosing a basis of V and mapping w1 ∧· · · ∧wn to the
determinant in F of the matrix with columns the expressions of the wi as linear
combinations of the given basis. One extends the deﬁnition by Λ1V = V and
Λ0V = F. We note that for 1 ≤d ≤n one has that w1 ∧· · · ∧wd ̸= 0 if and
only if w1, . . . , wd are linearly independent over F.
Both the symmetric powers and the exterior powers can also be deﬁned in a
categorical way using symmetric multilinear maps and alternating multilinear
maps.
Deﬁnition 2.8 Cyclic vector.
Let M be a diﬀerential module over k. An element e ∈M is called a cyclic
vector if M is generated over k by the elements e, ∂e, ∂2e, . . . .
2
The following proposition extends Lemma 2.5.
Proposition 2.9 Every ﬁnitely generated left k[∂]-module has the form k[∂]n
or k[∂]n ⊕k[∂]/k[∂]L with n ≥0 and L ∈k[∂].
Proof.
The only thing that we have to show is that a diﬀerential module M of
dimension n over k is isomorphic to k[∂]/k[∂]L for some L. This translates into
the existence of an element e ∈M such that M is generated by e, ∂e, . . . , ∂n−1e.
In other words, e is a cyclic vector for M.

THE RING D
43
Any k[∂]-linear map φ : k[∂] →M is determined by e := φ(1) ∈M, where
1 ∈k[∂] is the obvious element. The map φ is surjective if and only if e is a
cyclic element. If the map is surjective, then its kernel is a left ideal in k[∂] and
has the form k[∂]L. Thus k[∂]/k[∂]L ∼= M. On the other hand, an isomorphism
k[∂]/k[∂]L ∼= M induces a surjective k[∂]-linear map k[∂] →M. The proof of
the existence of a cyclic vector for M is reproduced from the paper [154] by
N. Katz.
Choose an element h ∈k with h′ ̸= 0 and deﬁne δ = h′
h ∂. Then k[∂] = D is
also equal to k[δ]. Further δh = hδ +h and δhk = hkδ +khk for all k ∈Z. Take
an e ∈M. Then De is the subspace of M generated over k by e, δe, δ2e, . . . .
Let De have dimension m. If m = n then we are ﬁnished. If m < n then we
will produce an element ˜e = e + λhkf, where λ ∈Q and k ∈Z and f ∈M \ De,
such that dim D˜e > m. This will prove the existence of a cyclic vector. We will
work in the exterior product Λm+1M and consider the element
E := ˜e ∧δ(˜e) ∧· · · ∧δm(˜e) ∈Λm+1M.
The multilinearity of the ∧and the rule δhk = hkδ+khk lead to a decomposition
of E of the form
E =

0≤a≤m
(λhk)a(

0≤b
kbωa,b), with ωa,b ∈Λm+1M independent of λ, k.
Suppose that E is zero for every choice of λ and k. Fix k. For every λ ∈Q
one ﬁnds a linear dependence of the m + 1 terms 
0≤b kbωa,b. One concludes
that for every a the term 
0≤b kbωa,b is zero for all choices of k ∈Z. The
same argument shows that each ωa,b = 0. However, one easily calculates that
ω1,m = e∧δ(e)∧· · ·∧δm−1(e)∧f. This term is not zero by our choice of f.
2
There are other proofs of the existence of a cyclic vector, relevant for algo-
rithms. These proofs produce a set S ⊂M of small cardinality such that S
contains a cyclic vector. We will give two of those statements. The ﬁrst one is
due to Kovacic [167] (with some similarities to Cope [72, 73]).
Lemma 2.10 Let M be a diﬀerential module with k-basis {e1, . . . , en} and let
η1, . . . , ηn ∈k be linearly independent over C, the constants of k. Then there
exist integers 0 ≤ci,j ≤n, 1 ≤i, j ≤n, such that m = n
i=1 aiei is a cyclic
vector for M, where ai = n
j=1 ci,jηj. In particular, if z ∈k, z′ ̸= 0, then
ai = n
j=1 ci,jzj−1 is, for suitable ci,j as above, a cyclic vector.
The second one is due to Katz [154].
Lemma 2.11 Assume that k contains an element z such that z′ = 1. Let M
be a diﬀerential module with k-basis {e0, . . . , en−1}. There exists a set S ⊂C
with at most n(n −1) elements such that if a /∈S the element

CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
We refer to the literature for the proofs of these and to [80, 143, 236, 6, 30,
31]. For a generalization of the cyclic vector construction to systems of nonlinear
diﬀerential equations, see [70].
2.2
Constructions with Diﬀerential Modules
The constructions with vector spaces (direct sums, tensor products, symmet-
ric powers etc) extend to several other categories. The ﬁrst interesting case
concerns a ﬁnite group G and a ﬁeld F. The category has as objects the repre-
sentations G in ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces over F. A representation (ρ, V )
is a homomorphism ρ : G →GL(V ), where V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space
over F. The tensor product (ρ1, V1)⊗(ρ2, V2) is the representation (ρ3, V3) with
V3 = V1 ⊗F V2 and ρ3 given by the formula ρ3(v1 ⊗v2) = (ρ1v1) ⊗(ρ2v2). In a
similar way one deﬁnes direct sums, quotient representations, symmetric powers
and exterior powers of a representation.
A second interesting case concerns a linear algebraic group G over F. A rep-
resentation (ρ, V ) consists of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space V over F and
a homomorphism of algebraic groups over F, ρ : G →GL(V ). The formulas
for tensor products and other constructions are the same as for ﬁnite groups.
This example (and its extension to aﬃne group schemes) is explained in the
appendices.
A third example concerns a Lie algebra L over F.
A representation (ρ, V )
consists of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space V over F and an F-linear map
ρ : L →End(V ) satisfying the property ρ([A, B]) = [ρ(A), ρ(B)]. The tensor
product (ρ1, V1) ⊗(ρ2, V2) = (ρ3, V3) with again V3 = V1 ⊗F V2 and with ρ3
given by the formula ρ3(v1 ⊗v2) = (ρ1v1) ⊗v2 + v1 ⊗(ρ2v2).
As we will see, the above examples are related with constructions with dif-
ferential modules. The last example is rather close to the constructions with
diﬀerential modules.
The category of all diﬀerential modules over k will be denoted by Diﬀk. Now we
start the list of constructions of linear algebra for diﬀerential modules.
The direct sum (M1, ∂1) ⊕(M2, ∂2) is (M3, ∂3), where M3 = M1 ⊕M2 and
∂3(m1 ⊕m2) = ∂1(m1) ⊕∂2(m2).
A (diﬀerential) submodule N of (M, ∂) is a k-vector space N ⊂M such that
∂(N) ⊂N. Then N = (N, ∂|N) is a diﬀerential module.
Let N be a submodule of (M, ∂). Then M/N, provided with the induced map
∂, given by ∂(m + N) = ∂(m) + N, is the quotient diﬀerential module .
The tensor product (M1, ∂1)⊗(M2, ∂2) is (M3, ∂3) with M3 = M1 ⊗k M2 and ∂3
is given by the formula ∂3(m1 ⊗m2) = (∂1m1) ⊗m2 + m1 ⊗(∂2m2). We note
that this is not at all the tensor product of two k[∂]-modules. In fact, the tensor
product of two left k[∂]-modules does not exist since k[∂] is not commutative.
A morphism φ : (M1, ∂1) →(M2, ∂2) is a k-linear map such that φ ◦∂1 = ∂2 ◦φ.

CONSTRUCTIONS WITH DIFFERENTIAL MODULES
45
If we regard diﬀerential modules as special left k[∂]-modules, then the above
translates into φ is a k[∂]-linear map. We will sometimes write Homk[∂](M1, M2)
(omitting ∂1 and ∂2 in the notation) for the C-vector space of all morphisms.
This object is not a diﬀerential module over k, but it is Mor(M1, M2) the C-
linear vector space of the morphisms in the category Diﬀk.
The internal Hom, Homk((M1, ∂1), (M2, ∂2)) of two diﬀerential modules is the
k-vector space Homk(M1, M2) of the k-linear maps form M1 to M2 provided
with a ∂given by the formula (∂ℓ)(m1) = ℓ(∂1m1) −∂2(ℓ(m1)). This formula
leads to the observation that
Homk[∂](M1, M2) is equal to {ℓ∈Homk(M1, M2)| ∂ℓ= 0}.
In particular, the C-vector space Mor(M1, M2) = Homk[∂](M1, M2) has dimen-
sion at most dimk M1 · dimk M2.
The trivial diﬀerential module of dimension 1 over k is again denoted by 1k or
1. A special case of internal Hom is the dual M ∗of a diﬀerential module M
deﬁned by M ∗= Homk(M, 1k).
Symmetric powers and exterior powers are derived from tensor products and
the formation of quotients. Their structure can be made explicit. The exterior
power ΛdM, for instance, is the k-vector space Λd
kM provided with the operation
∂given by the formula ∂(m1 ∧· · · ∧md) = d
i=1 m1 ∧· · · ∧(∂mi) ∧· · · ∧md.
The next collection of exercises presents some of the many properties of the
above constructions and their translations into the language of diﬀerential op-
erators and matrix diﬀerential equations.

vector and that L∗e = 0.
7. The diﬀerential module ML associated to the diﬀerential operator L.
Consider an operator L = ∂n + an−1∂n−1 + · · · + a0 ∈k[∂]. As in Section 1.2,
one associates to L a matrix diﬀerential equation Y ′ = ALY , where AL is the
companion matrix

This matrix diﬀerential equation induces a diﬀerential module ML and we call
this the diﬀerential module associated with the operator L.
(a) Prove that the diﬀerential modules ML and (k[∂]/k[∂]L)∗are isomorphic.
(b) Operators of the same type.
Let L1, L2 ∈k[∂] by monic of degree n. Prove that ML1 and ML2 are isomorphic
if and only if there are elements R, S ∈k[∂] of degree < n such that L1R = SL2
and GCRD(R, L2) = 1.
Hint: Describe an isomorphism φ : k[∂]/k[∂]L1 →k[∂]/k[∂]L2 by an operator
of degree < n representing the element φ(1) ∈k[∂]/k[∂]L2.
In the classical literature, operators L1, L2 such that ML1 ∼= ML2 are called
of the same type .
This concept appears in the 19th Century literature (for
references to this literature as well as more recent references, see [270]).
(c) Prove that every matrix diﬀerential equation is equivalent to an equation of
the form Y ′ = ALY .
8. The matrix diﬀerential of the dual M ∗.
Let M be a diﬀerential equation and let y′ = Ay be an associated matrix
diﬀerential equation by the choice of a basis {e1, . . . , en}.
Find the matrix
diﬀerential equation for M ∗associated to the dual basis {e∗
1, . . . , e∗
n} of M ∗.
9. Extensions of diﬀerential ﬁelds.
Let K ⊃k be an extension of diﬀerential ﬁelds. For any diﬀerential module
(M, ∂) over k one considers the K-vector space K ⊗k M. One deﬁnes ∂on
K ⊗k M by ∂(a ⊗m) = a′ ⊗m + a ⊗(∂m). Show that this deﬁnition makes
sense and that (K ⊗k M, ∂) is a diﬀerential module over K. Prove that the
formation M →K ⊗k M commutes with all constructions of linear algebra.
10. The characterization of the “internal hom”.
For the reader, familiar with representable functors, this exercise which shows
that the “internal hom” is derived from the tensor product, might be interesting.
Consider two diﬀerential modules M1, M2. Associate to this the contravariant
functor F from Diﬀk to the category of sets given by the formula F(T ) =
Homk[∂](T ⊗M1, M2).
Show that F is a representable functor and that it

is represented by Homk(M1, M2). Compare also the deﬁnition of Tannakian
category given in the appendices.
2
Now we continue Exercise 2.12 part 7. and the set of morphisms between
two diﬀerential modules in terms of diﬀerential operators. An operator L ∈k[∂]
is said to be reducible over k if L has a nontrivial right hand factor. Otherwise
L is called irreducible. Suppose that L is reducible, say L = L1L2. Then there
is an obvious exact sequence of diﬀerential modules
0 →D/DL1
.L2
→D/DL1L2 →D/DL2 →0,
where the ﬁrst non trivial arrow is multiplication on the right by L2 and the
second non trivial arrow is the quotient map. In particular, the monic right
hand factors of L correspond bijectively to the quotient modules of D/DL (and
at the same time to the submodules of D/DL).
Proposition 2.13 For L1, L2 ∈k[∂], one deﬁnes E(L1, L2) to consist of the
R ∈k[∂] with deg R < deg L2, such that there exists an S ∈k[∂] with L1R =
SL2.
(1) There is a natural C-linear bijection between E(L1, L2) and
Homk[∂](k[∂]/k[∂]L1, k[∂]/k[∂]L2).
(2) E(L, L) or E(L) is called the (right) Eigenring of L.
This eigenring E(L)
is a ﬁnite dimensional C-subalgebra of Endk(k[∂]/k[∂]L), which contains C.id.
If L is irreducible and C is algebraically closed, then E(L) = C.id.
Proof.
(1) A k[∂]-linear map φ : k[∂]/k[∂]L1 →k[∂]/k[∂]L2 lifts uniquely to
a k[∂]-linear map ψ : k[∂] →k[∂] such that R := ψ(1) has degree < deg L2.
Further ψ(k[∂]L1) ⊂k[∂]L2. Hence ψ(L1) = L1R ∈k[∂]L2 and L1R = SL2 for
some S ∈k[∂]. On the other hand, an R and S with the stated properties deter-
mine a unique ψ which induces a k[∂]-linear map φ : k[∂]/k[∂]L1 →k[∂]/k[∂]L2.
(2) The ﬁrst statement is obvious. The kernel of any element of E(L) is a sub-
module of k[∂]/k[∂]L. If L is irreducible, then any nonzero element of E(L) is
injective and therefore also bijective. Hence E(L) is a division ring. Since C is
algebraically closed, one has E(L) = C.
2
Exercise 2.14 The Eigenring.
The eigenring provides a method to obtain factors of a reducible operator, see
[136, 270] and Section 4.2. However, even if C is algebraically closed, a reducible
operator L may satisfy E(L) = C.id. In this case no factorization is found. The
aim of this exercise is to provide an example.
1. The ﬁeld C of the constants of k is supposed to be algebraically closed. Let
M = k[∂]/k[∂]L be a diﬀerential module over k of dimension 2. Prove that
E(L) ̸= C.id if and only if M has a submodules N1, N2 of dimension 1 such
that N2 and M/N1 are isomorphic. Hint: E(L) ̸= C.id implies that there is a

48
CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
morphism φ : M →such that N1 := ker(φ) and N2 := im(φ) have dimension 1.
2. Take k = C(z), z′ = 1 and L = (∂+ 1 + z−1)(∂−1). Show that M :=
k[∂]/k[∂]L has only one submodule N of dimension 1 and that N and M/N are
not isomorphic.
Hint: The submodules of dimension 1 correspond to right hand factors ∂−u
of L, with u ∈k. Perform Kovacic’s algorithm to obtain the possibilities for u.
This works as follows (see also Chapter 4). Derive the equation u2 + z−1u +
u′ −(1 + z−1) = 0. Expand a potential solution u at z = 0 and z = ∞as a
Laurent series and show that u has no poles at z = 0 and z = ∞. At any point
c ∈C∗, the Laurent series of u has the form
ϵ
z−c + · · · with ϵ = 0, 1. Calculate
that u = 1 is the only possibility.
2
We end this section with a discussion of the “solution space” of a diﬀerential
module. To do this we shall need a universal diﬀerential extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld
k. This is deﬁned formally (and made explicit in certain cases) in Section 3.2
but for our purposes it is enough to require this to be a ﬁeld F ⊃k with the
same ﬁeld of constants of k such that any matrix diﬀerential equation Y ′ = AY
over k has a solution in GLn(F). Such a ﬁeld can be constructed as a direct
limit of all Picard-Vessiot extensions of k and we shall ﬁx one and denote it by
F. We note that Kolchin [161] uses the term universal extension to denote a
ﬁeld containing solutions of ALL diﬀerential equations but our restricted notion
is suﬃcient for our purposes.
Deﬁnition 2.15 Let M be a diﬀerential module over k with algebraically closed
constants C and F a universal diﬀerential extension of k. The covariant solution
space of M is the C-vector space ker(∂, F ⊗k M). The contravariant solution
space is the C-vector space Homk[∂](M, F).
2
The terms “covariant” and “contravariant” reﬂect the following properties.
Let φ : M1 →M2 be a morphism of diﬀerential modules. Then there are induced
homomorphisms of C-vector spaces φ∗: ker(∂, F ⊗k M1) →ker(∂, F ⊗k M2)
and φ∗: Homk[∂](M2, F) →Homk[∂](M1, F). Let 0 →M1 →M2 →M3 →0
be an exact sequence of diﬀerential modules, then so is
0 →ker(∂, F ⊗k M1) →ker(∂, F ⊗k M2) →ker(∂, F ⊗k M3) →0.
This follows easily from the exactness of the sequence
0 →F ⊗k M1 →F ⊗k M2 →F ⊗k M3 →0
and the observation that dimC ker(∂, F ⊗k M) = dimk M for any diﬀerential
module M over k. The contravariant solution space induces also a contravariant
exact functor from diﬀerential modules to ﬁnite dimensional C-vector spaces.
Lemma 2.16 Let M be a diﬀerential modules with basis e1, . . . , en and let ∂ei =
−
j aj,iej and A = (ai,j). Then

1. ker(∂, F ⊗k M) ≃{y ∈Fn | y′ = Ay}.
2. There are natural C-vector space isomorphisms
Homk[∂](M, F) ≃HomF[∂](F ⊗k M, F) ≃HomC(ker(∂, F ⊗k M), C).
3. Let e ∈M and let L ∈k[∂] be its minimal monic annihilator. Let W = {y ∈
F | L(y) = 0}. The map Homk[∂](M, F) →W ⊂F, given by φ →φ(e), is
surjective.
Proof.
1. The basis e1, . . . , en yields an identiﬁcation of F ⊗M with Fn and
of ∂with the operator
d
dz −A on Fn.
2. Any k[∂]-linear map φ : M →F extends to an F[∂]-linear map F ⊗kM →F.
This gives the ﬁrst isomorphism. Any φ in HomF[∂](F ⊗k M, F) deﬁnes by
restriction a C-linear map ˜φ : ker(∂, F⊗kM) →C. The map φ →˜φ is a bijection
since the natural map F ⊗C ker(∂, F ⊗k M) →F ⊗k M is an isomorphism.
3.
The natural morphism Homk[∂](M, F) →Homk[∂](k[∂]e, F) is surjective,
since these spaces are contravariant solution spaces and k[∂]e is a submodule of
M. The map Homk[∂](k[∂]e, F) →W, given by φ →φ(e), is bijective since the
map k[∂]/k[∂]L →k[∂]e (with 1 →e) is bijective.

2.3
Constructions with Diﬀerential Operators
Diﬀerential operators do not form a category where one can perform construc-
tions of linear algebra. However, in the literature tensor products, symmetric
powers etc. of diﬀerential operators are often used. In this section we will ex-
plain this somewhat confusing terminology and relate it with the constructions
of linear algebra on diﬀerential modules.
A pair (M, e) of a diﬀerential module M and a cyclic vector e ∈M deter-
mines a monic diﬀerential operator L, namely the operator of smallest degree
with Le = 0. Two such pairs (Mi, ei), i = 1, 2 deﬁne the same monic operator
if and only if there exists an isomorphism ψ : M1 →M2 of diﬀerential modules
such that ψe1 = e2. Moreover, this ψ is unique. For a monic diﬀerential op-
erator L one chooses a corresponding pair (M, e). On M and e one performs
the construction of linear algebra. This yields a pair (constr(M), constr(e)).
Now constr(L) is deﬁned as the monic diﬀerential operator of minimal degree
with constr(L)constr(e) = 0. This procedure extends to constructions involving
several monic diﬀerential operators. There is one complicating factor, namely
constr(e) is in general not a cyclic vector for constr(M).
There is another interpretation of a monic diﬀerential operator L. Let, as
before, F ⊃k denote a ﬁxed universal diﬀerential ﬁeld. One can associate to
L its solution space Sol(L) := {y ∈F|L(y) = 0}. This space determines L.
Indeed, suppose that L = ∂n + an−1∂n−1 + · · · + a1∂+ a0. Then Sol(L) has

50
CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
dimension n over C. Let y1, . . . , yn be a basis of Sol(L). Then an−1, . . . , a0
satisfy the linear equations
y(n)
i
+ an−1y(n−1)
i
+ · · · + a1y(1)
i
+ a0yi = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n.
The wronskian matrix of y1, . . . , yn has non-zero determinant and thus the equa-
tions determine an−1, . . . , a0. Let Gal(F/k) denote the group of the diﬀeren-
tial automorphisms of F/k, i.e., the automorphisms of the ﬁeld F which are
k-linear and commute with the diﬀerentiation on F. For a Picard-Vessiot ex-
tension K ⊃k the group Gal(K/k) of diﬀerential automorphisms of K/k has
the property that KGal(K/k) = k. The universal diﬀerential extension F is the
direct limit of all Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld extensions of k. It follows from this that
FGal(F/k) = k. This leads to the following result.
Lemma 2.17 Let V ⊂F be a vector space over C of dimension n. There exists
a (unique) monic diﬀerential operator L ∈k[∂] with Sol(L) = V if and only if
V is (set wise) invariant under Gal(F/k).
Proof.
As above, one observes that any V determines a unique monic diﬀer-
ential operator L ∈F[∂] such that V = {y ∈F| L(y) = 0}. Then V is invariant
under Gal(F/k) if and only if L is invariant under Gal(F/k). The latter is
equivalent to L ∈k[∂].
2
We note that the lemma remains valid if F is replaced by a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld
extension K ⊃k and Gal(F/k) by Gal(K/k).
This leads to another way, omnipresent in the literature, of deﬁning a con-
struction of linear algebra to a monic diﬀerential operator L. One applies this
construction to Sol(L) and ﬁnds a new subspace V of F. This subspace is ﬁnite
dimensional over C and invariant under G. By the above lemma this determines
a new monic diﬀerential operator. This procedure extends to constructions with
several monic diﬀerential operators.
The link between these two ways of making new operators is given by the
contravariant solution space. Consider a monic diﬀerential operator L and a
corresponding pair (M, e). By Deﬁnition 2.15 and Lemma 2.16, Sol(L) is the
image of the contravariant solution space Homk[∂](M, F) of M under the map
φ →φ(e). We will make the above explicit for various constructions of linear
algebra. Needless to say that this section is only concerned with the language
of diﬀerential equations and does not contain new results.
Tensor Products. Let (Mi, ei), i = 1, 2 denote two diﬀerential modules with
cyclic vectors. The tensor product construction is (M1⊗M2, e1⊗e2). In general
e1 ⊗e2 need not be a cyclic vector of M1 ⊗M2 (see Exercise 2.21). Our goal
is to describe the contravariant solution space of M1 ⊗M2, the minimal monic
annihilator of e1 ⊗e2 and its solution space in F.

CONSTRUCTIONS WITH DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS
51
Lemma 2.18 The canonical isomorphism
Homk[∂](M1, F) ⊗C Homk[∂](M2, F) ≃Homk[∂](M1 ⊗M2, F)
is described by φ1 ⊗φ2 →φ1 ⊗φ2 where φ1 ⊗φ2(m1 ⊗m2) := φ(m1)φ2(m2).
Proof.
The canonical isomorphism c : (F ⊗k M1) ⊗F (F ⊗k M2) →F ⊗k
(M1 ⊗k M2) of diﬀerential modules over F is given by (f1 ⊗m1) ⊗(f2 ⊗m2) →
f1f2 ⊗m1 ⊗m2. This c induces an isomorphism of the covariant solution spaces
ker(∂, F ⊗k M1) ⊗C ker(∂, F ⊗k M2) →ker(∂, F ⊗k (M1 ⊗k M2)).
We write again c for this map. By taking duals as C-vector spaces and after
replacing c by c−1 one obtains the required map (c−1)∗(c.f., Lemma 2.16). The
formula for this map is easily veriﬁed.
2
Corollary 2.19 Let the monic diﬀerential operators Li correspond to the pairs
(Mi, ei) for i = 1, 2. Let L be the monic operator of minimal degree such that
L(e1 ⊗e2) = 0. Then the solution space of L in F, i.e., {y ∈F|L(y) = 0},
is equal to the image of the contravariant solution space Homk[∂](M1 ⊗M2, F)
under the map φ →φ(e1⊗e2). In particular, L is the monic diﬀerential operator
of minimal degree such that L(y1y2) = 0 for all pairs y1, y2 ∈F such that
L1(y1) = L2(y2) = 0.
Proof.
Apply Lemma 2.16.3.
to e1 ⊗e2.
The image of the contravariant
solution space of M1 ⊗M2 in F under the map φ →φ(e1 ⊗e2) is generated as
vector space over C by the products φ1(e1)φ2(e2), according to Lemma 2.18.
2
It is hardly possible to compute the monic operator L of minimal degree
satisfying L(e1 ⊗e2) = 0 by the previous corollary. Indeed, F is in general not
explicit enough. The obvious way to ﬁnd L consists of computing the elements
∂n(e1 ⊗e2) in M1 ⊗M2 and to ﬁnd a linear relation over k between these
elements. In the literature one ﬁnds the following deﬁnition (or an equivalent
one) of the tensor product of two monic diﬀerential operators.
Deﬁnition 2.20 Let L1 and L2 be two diﬀerential operators. The minimal
monic annihilating operator of 1 ⊗1 in k[∂]/k[∂]L1 ⊗k[∂]/k[∂]L2 is the tensor
product L1 ⊗L2 of L1 and L2.
Exercise 2.21 Prove that ∂3 ⊗∂2 = ∂4.
2
Similar deﬁnitions and results hold for tensor products with more than two
factors.
Symmetric Powers. The dth symmetric power symdM of a diﬀerential module
is a quotient of the ordinary d-fold tensor product M ⊗· · · ⊗M. The image

52
CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
of m1 ⊗m2 ⊗· · · ⊗md in this quotient will be written as m1m2 · · · md.
In
particular, md denotes the image of m ⊗· · · ⊗m. This construction applied to
(M, e) produces (symdM, ed).
Lemma 2.22 Let M be a diﬀerential module over k. The canonical isomor-
phism of contravariant solution spaces
symd(Homk[∂](M, F)) →Homk[∂](symdM, F)
is given by the formula φ1φ2 · · · φd →φ1φ2 · · · φd, where
φ1φ2 · · · φd(m1m2 · · · md) := φ(m1)φ2(m2) · · · φd(md).
The proof is similar to that of 2.18. The same holds for the next corollary.
Corollary 2.23 Let L correspond to the pair (M, e). The image of the map
φ →φ(ed) from Homk[∂](symdM, F) to F is the C-vector space generated by
{f1f2 · · · fd | L(fi) = 0}.
Deﬁnition 2.24 Let L be a monic diﬀerential operator and let e = 1 be the
generator of k[∂]/k[∂]L. The minimal monic annihilating operator of ed in
symd(k[∂]/k[∂]L) is the dth symmetric power Symd(L) of L.
2
Exercise 2.25
(1) Show that Sym2(∂3) = ∂5.
(2) Show that Symd(L) has degree d+1 if L has degree 2. Hint:Proposition 4.26.
2
Exterior Powers. One associates to a pair (M, e) (with e a cyclic vector) the
pair (ΛdM, e ∧∂e ∧· · · ∧∂d−1e).
Deﬁnition 2.26 Let L be a diﬀerential operator and let e = 1 be the generator
of k[∂]/k[∂]L. The minimal monic annihilating operator of e ∧∂e ∧. . . ∧∂d−1e
in ∧d(k[∂]/k[∂]L) is the dth exterior power Λd(L) of L. .
2
We denote by Sd the permutation group of d elements. Similar to the previous
constructions one has
Lemma 2.27 Let M be a diﬀerential module over k. The natural isomorphism
of contravariant solution spaces
Λd
CHomk[∂](M, F) →Homk[∂](∧d

is given by φ1 ∧· · · ∧φd →φ1 ∧· · · ∧φd, where φ1 ∧· · · ∧φd(m1 ∧· · · ∧md) :=

the map φ →φ(e ∧∂e ∧. . . ∧∂d−1e) deﬁnes a surjection of Homk[∂](ΛdM, F)
onto W and W is the solution space of the minimal annihilating operator of
e ∧∂e ∧. . . ∧∂d−1e.

e ∧(−a2∂2e −a1∂e −0 e) + ∂e ∧∂2e
Therefore (∂2 + a2∂+ a1)v = ∂e ∧∂2e and so ∂(∂2 + a2∂+ a1)v = ∂e ∧
(−a2∂2e −a1∂e −a0e). This implies that the minimal annihilating operator of
v is (∂+ a2)(∂2 + a2∂+ a1) −a0.

It is no accident that the order of the (n−1)st exterior power of an operator
of order n is also n. The following exercise outlines a justiﬁcation.

CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
Exercise 2.30 Exterior powers and adjoint operators
Let L = ∂n + an−1∂(n−1) + · · · + a0 with ai ∈k. Let K be a Picard-Vessiot
extension of k associated with L and let {y1, . . . , yn} be a fundamental set of
solutions of L(y) = 0. The set {u1, . . . , un} where ui = wr(y1, . . . , ˆyi, . . . , yn}
spans the solution space of Λn−1(L). The aim of this exercise is to show that
the set {u1, . . . , un} is linearly independent and so Λn−1(L) always has order n.
We furthermore show that the operators Λn−1(L) and L∗(the adjoint of L, see
Exercise 2.1) are related in a special way (c.f., [254] §167-171).
1. Show that vi = ui/wr(y1, . . . , yn) satisﬁes L∗(vi) = 0. Hint: Let AL be the
companion matrix of L and W = Wr(y1, . . . , yn). Since W ′ = ALW, we have
that U = (W −1)T satisﬁes U ′ = −AT
LU. Let (f0, . . . , fn−1)T be a column of U.
Note that fn−1 = vi for some i. One has (c.f., Exercise 2.1),

This last equation implies that 0 = L∗(fn) = L∗(vi).
2. Show that wr(v1, . . . , vn) ̸= 0. Therefore the map z →z/wr(y1, . . . , yn)
is an isomorphism of the solution space of Λn−1(L) onto the solution space
of L∗and, in particular, the order of Λn−1(L) is always n. Hint: Standard
facts about determinants imply that n
i=1 viyj
i = 0 for j = 0, 1, . . . , n −2 and
n

Use these equations and their derivatives to show that
Wr(v1, . . . , vn)Wr(y1, . . . , yn) = 1.

Exercise 2.31 Show that Λ2(∂4) = ∂5. Therefore the dth exterior power of an
operator of order n can have order less than

. Hint: Show that the solution
space of Λ2(∂4) is the space of polynomials of degree at most 4.
2
We note that in the classical literature (c.f., [254], §167), the dth exterior power
of an operator is referred to as the (n −d)th associated operator.
In connection with Chapter 4, a generalization of Λd(L) is of interest. This
generalization is present in the algorithms developed by Tsarev, Grigoriev et

Let I = (i1, . . . , id), 0 ≤i1 < . . . < id ≤n −1. Let e = 1 in k[∂]/k[∂]L. We
deﬁne the dth exterior power of L with respect to I, denoted by Λd
I(L), to be the
minimal annihilating operator of ∂i1e∧· · ·∧∂ide in Λd(k[∂]/k[∂]L). One sees as
above that the solution space of Λd
I(L) is generated by {wI(y1, . . . , yd) | L(yi) =
0} where wI(y1, . . . , yd) is the determinant of the d × d matrix formed from the

This operator is calculated by diﬀerentiating the element v = ∂i1e ∧· · · ∧∂ide

Lemma 2.32 Let k and L be as above and assume that Λd(L) has order ν =

If Λd(L) has order ν, then this implies that the system of equations
(2.1) has rank ν. Furthermore, ∂i1e ∧· · · ∧∂ide appears as one of the terms
in this system. Therefore we can solve for ∂i1e ∧· · · ∧∂ide as a linear function

We close this section by noting the Maple V contains commands in its
DEtools package to calculate tensor products, symmetric powers and exterior
powers of operators.
2.4
Diﬀerential Modules and Representations
Throughout this section k will denote a diﬀerential ﬁeld with algebraically closed
subﬁeld of constants C.
We recall that Diﬀk denotes the category of all diﬀerential modules over
k. Fix a diﬀerential module M over k. For integers m, n ≥0 one deﬁnes the
diﬀerential module M m
n = M ⊗· · · M ⊗M ∗⊗· · · ⊗M ∗, i.e., the tensor product
of n copies of M and m copies of the dual M ∗of M. For m = n = 0 the
expression M 0
0 is supposed to mean 1 = 1k, the trivial 1-dimensional module

56
CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
over k. A subquotient of a diﬀerential module N is a diﬀerential module of the
form N1/N2 with N2 ⊂N1 ⊂N submodules. The subcategory {{M}} of Diﬀk
is deﬁned by: The objects of this category are the subquotients of ﬁnite direct
sums of the M m
n .
For objects A, B of {{M}} one deﬁnes Hom(A, B) to be
Homk[∂](A, B). Thus Hom(A, B) has the same meaning in {{M}} and in Diﬀk.
This is usually called “{{M}} is a full subcategory of Diﬀk.” It is easily seen
that {{M}} is the smallest full subcategory of Diﬀk which contains M and is
closed under all operations of linear algebra (i.e., direct sums, tensor products,
duals, subquotients).
For a linear algebraic group G over C one considers the category ReprG which
consists of the representations of G on ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces over C
(see the beginning of Section 2.2 and the appendices).
A ﬁnite dimensional
vector space W over C together with a representation ρ : G →GL(W) is also
called a G-module. In the category ReprG one can also perform all operations
of linear algebra (i.e., direct sums, tensor products, duals, subquotients). The
strong connection between the diﬀerential module M and its diﬀerential Galois
group G is given in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.33 Let M be a diﬀerential module over k and let G denote its
diﬀerential Galois group. There is an C-linear equivalence of categories
S : {{M}} →ReprG,
which is compatible with all constructions of linear algebra.
Proof.
We start by explaining the terminology. First of all, S is a functor.
This means that S associates to every object A of the ﬁrst category an object
S(A) of the second category. Likewise, S associates to every morphism f ∈
Hom(A, B) of the ﬁrst category a morphism S(f) ∈Hom(S(A), S(B)) of the
second category. The following rules should be satisﬁed:
S(1A) = 1S(A) and S(f ◦g) = S(f) ◦S(g).
The term C-linear means that the map from Hom(A, B) to Hom(S(A), S(B)),
given by f →S(f), is C-linear. The term “equivalence” means that the map
Hom(A, B) →Hom(S(A), S(B)) is bijective and that there exists for every
object B of the second category an object A of the ﬁrst category such that S(A)
is isomorphic to B. The compatibility of S with, say, tensor products means that
there are isomorphisms iA,B : S(A ⊗B) →S(A) ⊗S(B). These isomorphism
should be “natural” in the sense that for any morphisms f : A →A′, g : B →B′
the following diagram is commutative.
S(A ⊗B)
S(f⊗g)
−→
S(A′ ⊗B′)
iA,B
↓
iA′,B′
↓
S(A) ⊗S(B)
S(f)⊗S(g)
−→
S(A′) ⊗S(B′)
Thus the compatibility with the constructions of linear algebra means that S
maps a construction in the ﬁrst category to one object in the second category

DIFFERENTIAL MODULES AND REPRESENTATIONS
57
which is in a “natural” way isomorphic to the same construction in the second
category. For the S that we will construct almost all these properties will be
obvious.
For the deﬁnition of S we need the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld K ⊃k of M. The
diﬀerential module K ⊗k M over K is trivial in the sense that there is a K-basis
e1, . . . , ed of K ⊗k M such that ∂ei = 0 for all i. In other words, the obvious
map K ⊗C ker(∂, K ⊗k M) →K ⊗k M is a bijection. Indeed, this is part of the
deﬁnition of the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld. Also every K⊗kM m
n is a trivial diﬀerential
module over K. We conclude that for every object N of {{M}} the diﬀerential
module K ⊗k N is trivial. One deﬁnes S by S(N) = ker(∂, K ⊗k N). This
object is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C. The action of G on K ⊗k N
(induced by the action of G on K) commutes with ∂and thus G acts on the
kernel of ∂on K ⊗k N. From Theorem 1.27 one easily deduces that the action
of G on ker(∂, K ⊗k N) is algebraic. In other words, S(N) is a representation of
G on a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C. Let f : A →B be a morphism in
{{M}}. Then f extends to a K-linear map 1K ⊗f : K ⊗k A →K ⊗k B, which
commutes with ∂. Therefore f induces a C-linear map S(f) : S(A) →S(B)
with commutes with the G-actions.
We will omit the straightforward and tedious veriﬁcation that S commutes
with the constructions of linear algebra.
It is not a banality to show that
Hom(A, B) →Hom(S(A), S(B)) is a bijection. Since Hom(A, B) is equal to
ker(∂, A∗⊗B) = Hom(1k, A∗⊗B) we may suppose that A = 1k and that B
is arbitrary. Clearly S(1k) = 1G, where the latter is the 1-dimensional trivial
representation of G. Now Hom(1k, B) is equal to {b ∈B| ∂(b) = 0}. Further
Hom(1G, S(B)) is equal to {v ∈ker(∂, K ⊗k B)| gv = v for all g ∈G}. Since
KG = k, one has (K ⊗k B)G = B. This implies that {b ∈B| ∂b = 0} →
Hom(1G, S(B)) is a bijection.
Finally we have to show that any representation B of G is equivalent to the
representation S(A) for some A ∈{{M}}. This follows from the following fact
on representations of any linear algebraic group G (see [301] and the appendices):
Suppose that V is a faithful representation of G (i.e., G →GL(V ) is injec-
tive). Then every representation of G is a direct sum of subquotients of the
representations V ⊗· · · ⊗V ⊗V ∗⊗· · · ⊗V ∗.
In our situation we take for V the representation S(M) which is by deﬁnition
faithful. Since S commutes with the constructions of linear algebra, we have
that any representation of G is isomorphic to S(N) for some N which is a direct
sum of subquotients of the M m
n . In other words N is an object of {{M}}.
2
Remarks 2.34
(1) In the terminology of Tannakian categories, Theorem 2.33 states that the
category {{M}} is a neutral tannakian category and that G is the corresponding
aﬃne group scheme (see the appendices).
(2) The functor S has an “inverse”. We will describe this inverse by constructing
the diﬀerential module N corresponding to a given representation W.
One

CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
considers the trivial diﬀerential module K ⊗C W over K with ∂deﬁned by
∂(1 ⊗w) = 0 for every w ∈W. The group G acts on K ⊗C W by g(f ⊗w) =
g(f)⊗g(w) for every g ∈G. Now one takes the G-invariants N := (K ⊗C W)G.
This is a vector space over k. The operator ∂maps N to N, since ∂commutes
with the action of G. One has now to show that N has ﬁnite dimension over k,
that N is an object of {{M}} and that S(N) is isomorphic to W.
We know already that W ∼= S(A) for some object A in {{M}}. Let us write
W = S(A) for convenience. Then by the deﬁnition of S one has K ⊗C W =
K ⊗k A and the two objects have the same G-action and the same ∂. Then
(K ⊗C W)G = A and this ﬁnishes the proof.
(3) Let H be a closed normal subgroup of G. Choose a representation W of G
such that the kernel of G →GL(W) is H. Let N be an object of {{M}} with
S(N) = W. The ﬁeld K contains a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld L for N, since K ⊗k N
is a trivial diﬀerential module over K. The action of the subgroup H on L is the
identity since by construction the diﬀerential Galois group of N is G/H. Hence
L ⊂KH. Equality holds by Galois correspondence, see 1.34 part 1. Thus we
have obtained a more natural proof of the statement in loc.cit. part 2., namely
that KH is the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of some diﬀerential equation over k.
2
Corollary 2.35 Let L ∈k[∂] be a monic diﬀerential operator of degree ≥1. Let
K be the Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld of M := k[∂]/k[∂]L and G its diﬀerential Galois
group. Put V = ker(∂, K ⊗k M) (This is the covariant solution space of M).
There are natural bijections between:
(a) The G-invariant subspaces of V .
(b) The submodules of M.
(c) The monic right hand factors of L.
The only thing to explain is the correspondence between (b) and (c). Let e = 1
be the cyclic element of M and let N be a submodule of M. There is a unique
monic operator R of minimal degree such that Re ∈N. This is a right hand
factor of L.
Moreover M/N = D/DR (compare the exact sequence before
Proposition 2.13). Of course R determines also a unique left hand factor of L.
We note that the above corollary can also be formulated for the contravariant
solution space Homk[∂](M, K).
We recall that an operator L ∈k[∂] is reducible over k if L has a non trivial
right hand factor. Otherwise L is called irreducible. The same terminology is
used for diﬀerential equations in matrix form or for diﬀerential modules or for
representations of a linear algebraic group over C.
Exercise 2.36 Show that a matrix diﬀerential equation is reducible if and only
if it is equivalent to an equation Y ′ = BY, B ∈Mn(k) where B has the form

DIFFERENTIAL MODULES AND REPRESENTATIONS

Deﬁnition 2.37 A diﬀerential module M is called completely reducible or semi-
simple if there exists for every submodule N of M a submodule N ′ such that
M = N ⊕N ′.
2
The same terminology is used for diﬀerential operators and for representations
of a linear algebraic group G over C. We note that the terminology is some-
what confusing because an irreducible module is at the same time completely
reducible.
A G-module W and a G-submodule W1 has a complementary submodule
if there is a G-submodule W2 of W such that W = W1 ⊕W2.
Thus a (ﬁ-
nite dimensional) G-module V is completely reducible if every G-submodule has
a complementary submodule. This is equivalent to V being a direct sum of
irreducible submodules (compare with Exercise 2.38 part (1)).
The unipotent radical of a linear algebraic group G is the largest normal
unipotent subgroup Gu of G (see [141] for deﬁnitions of these notions). The
group G is called reductive if Gu is trivial. We note that for this terminology G
is reductive if and only Go is reductive.
When G is deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero, it is
known that G is reductive if and only if it has a faithful completely reducible
G-module (c.f., the Appendix of [32]). In this case, all G-modules will be com-
pletely reducible.
Exercise 2.38 Completely reducible modules and reductive groups.
(1) Show that M is completely reducible if and only if M is a direct sum of
irreducible modules. Is this direct sum unique?
(2) Let M be a diﬀerential module. Show that M is completely reducible if and
only if its diﬀerential Galois group is reductive. Hint: Use the above information
on reductive groups.
(3) Let M be a completely reducible diﬀerential module.
Prove that every
object N of {{M}} is completely reducible. Hint: Use the above information
on reductive groups.
(4) Show that the tensor product M1 ⊗M2 of two completely reducible modules
is again completely reducible. Hint: Apply (2) and (3) with M := M1 ⊕M2.
We note that a direct proof (not using reductive groups) of this fact seems to
be unknown.
2
Exercise 2.39 Completely reducible diﬀerential operators.
(1) Let R1, . . . , Rs denote irreducible monic diﬀerential operators (of degree
≥1).
Let L denote LCLM(R1, . . . , Rs), the least common left multiple of
R1, . . . , Rs.
In other terms, L is the monic diﬀerential operator satisfying
k[∂]L = ∩s
i=1k[∂]Ri. This generalizes the LCLM of two diﬀerential operators,
deﬁned in Section 2.1. Show that the obvious map k[∂]/k[∂]L →k[∂]/k[∂]R1 ⊕
· · · ⊕k[∂]/k[∂]Rs is injective. Conclude that L is completely reducible.

60
CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES
(2) Suppose that L is monic and completely reducible.
Show that L is the
LCLM of suitable (distinct) monic irreducible operators R1, . . . , Rs. Hint: By
deﬁnition k[∂]/k[∂]L = M1⊕· · ·⊕Ms, where each Mi is irreducible. The element
¯1 ∈k[∂]/k[∂]L is written as ¯1 = m1+· · ·+ms with each mi ∈Mi. Let Li be the
monic operator of smallest degree with Limi = 0. Show that Li is irreducible
and that L = LCLM(L1, . . . , Ls).
(3) Let k = C be a ﬁeld of constants and let L be a linear operator in C[∂].
We may write L = p(∂) =  pi(∂)ni where the pi are distinct irreducible poly-
nomials and ni ≥0. Show that L is completely reducible if and only if all the
ni ≤1.
(4) Let k = C(z). Show that the operator L = ∂2 + (1/z)∂∈C(z)[∂] is not
completely reducible. Hint: The operator is reducible since L = (∂+ (1/z))(∂)
and ∂is the only ﬁrst order right factor.
2
Proposition 2.40 Let M be a completely reducible diﬀerential module. Then
M can be written as a direct sum M = M1 ⊕· · ·⊕Mr where each Mi is a direct
sum of ni copies of an irreducible module Ni. Moreover, Ni ̸∼= Nj for i ̸= j.
This unique decomposition is called the isotypical decomposition of M. Then
the eigenring E(M) (i.e., the ring of the endomorphisms of M) is equal to the
product r
i=1 Mni(C) of matrix algebras over C.
Proof.
The ﬁrst part of the proposition is rather obvious. For i ̸= j, every
morphism Ni →Nj is zero. Consider an endomorphism f : M →M. Then
f(Mi) ⊂Mi for every i. This shows already that the isotypical decomposition
is unique. Further Mi is isomorphic to Ni ⊗Li where Li is a trivial diﬀerential
module over k of dimension ni. One observes that E(Ni) = C.1Ni follows from
the irreducibility of Ni. From this one easily deduces that E(Mi) ∼= Mni(C).
2
We note that the above proposition is a special case of a result on semi-simple
modules over a suitable ring (compare [169], Chapter XVII, Section 1, Proposi-
tion 1.2).
The Jordan-H¨older Theorem is also valid for diﬀerential modules. We recall
its formulation. A tower of diﬀerential modules M1 ⊃M2 ⊃. . . ⊃Mr = {0}
is called a composition series if the set of quotients (Mi/Mi+1)r−1
i=1 consists of
irreducible modules.
Two composition series for M yield isomorphic sets of
irreducible quotients, up to a permutation of the indices.
A (monic) diﬀerential operator L can be written as a product L1 · · · Lr of ir-
reducible monic diﬀerential operators. For any other factorization L = R1 · · · Rs
with irreducible operators Ri, one has that r = s and there exists a permuta-
tion π of {1, . . . , r} such that Li is equivalent to Rπ(i). Indeed, the factoriza-
tion L = L1 · · · Lr induces for the module k[∂]/k[∂]L the composition series
k[∂]/k[∂]L ⊃k[∂]Lr/k[∂]L ⊃· · · .

DIFFERENTIAL MODULES AND REPRESENTATIONS

A monic diﬀerential operator has in general many factorizations into irre-

are ∂2 = (∂+ f ′

f ) with f a monic polynomial in z of degree ≤1.

CHAPTER 2. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS AND MODULES

Chapter 3
Formal Local Theory
In this chapter we will classify linear diﬀerential equations over the ﬁeld of formal
Laurent series K = k((z)) and describe their diﬀerential Galois groups. Here
k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0. For most of what follows
the choice of the ﬁeld k is immaterial. In the ﬁrst two sections one assumes
that k = C. This has the advantage that the roots of unity have the convenient
description e2πiλ with λ ∈Q. Moreover, for k = C one can compare diﬀerential
modules over K with diﬀerential modules over the ﬁeld of convergent Laurent
series C({z}). In the third section k is an arbitrary algebraically closed ﬁeld of
characteristic 0. Unless otherwise stated the term diﬀerential module will refer
in this chapter to a diﬀerential module over K.
3.1
Formal Classiﬁcation of Diﬀerential Equa-
tions
This classiﬁcation can be given in various ways:
1. A factorization of L ∈K[∂] into linear factors over the algebraic closure of
K.
2.
Finding a canonical form in each equivalence class of matrix diﬀerential
equations v′ = Av.
3. Description of the isomorphism classes of left K[∂]-modules of ﬁnite dimen-
sion over K.
4. Description of a fundamental matrix F for a matrix diﬀerential equation in
canonical form.
5. Description of a structure on the solution space V of the diﬀerential equation.
63

64
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
The problem is somewhat analogous to the classiﬁcation (or Jordan normal
form) of linear maps A acting on a vector space V of ﬁnite dimension over the
ﬁeld of real numbers R. Let us recall how this is done. The eigenvalues of A
are in general complex and therefore we need to make of V the complex vector
space W = C ⊗V . Let α1, · · · , αs denote the distinct eigenvalues of A. The
generalized eigenspace for the eigenvalue αi is deﬁned by;
W(αi) := {w ∈W | (A −αi)mw = 0 for suﬃciently large m}
One ﬁnds a decomposition W = ⊕W(αi) of W into A-invariant subspaces.
For each subspace W(αi) the operator Bi := A −αi is nilpotent and one can
decompose W(αi) as a direct sum of subspaces W(αi)k. Each such subspace has
a basis e1, · · · , er such that Bi(e1) = e2, · · · , Bi(er−1) = er, Bi(er) = 0. Writing
down the matrix of A with respect to this decompositions and these bases one
ﬁnds the familiar Jordan normal form for this matrix. The given fact that A is
a linear map on a real vector space implies now that for every complex αi its
conjugate is some αj and the “block-decompositions” of W(αi) and W(αj) are
the same.
To classify diﬀerential equations over K we will need to ﬁrst work over the
algebraic closure of K.
In the next section we shall show that every ﬁnite
algebraic extension of K of degree m over K is of the form Km := K(v) with
vm = z. In the sequel we will often write v = z1/m. The main result of this
chapter is:
Theorem 3.1 1. For every monic (skew) polynomial
L = ∂d + a1∂d−1 + · + ad−1∂+ ad ∈K[∂]
there is some integer m ≥1 and an element u ∈Km such that L has a factor-
ization of the form L = L2(∂−u).
2. After replacing K by a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension Km the diﬀerential equation in
matrix form v′ = Av (where ′ := z d
dz) is equivalent to a diﬀerential equation
u′ = Bu where the matrix B has a “decomposition” into square blocks Bi,a with
i = 1, . . . , s and 1 ≤a ≤mi of the form

such that Km ⊗

K M decomposes as a direct sum ⊕s
i=1Mi. For each i there is a
vector space Wi of ﬁnite dimension over C and a linear map Ci : Wi →Wi such
that Mi = Km ⊗C Wi and the operator δ := z∂on Mi is given by the formula
δ(f ⊗w) = (qif ⊗w) + (f ′ ⊗w) + (f ⊗Ci(w)).
In the sequel we prefer to work with δ = z∂instead of ∂. Of course K[∂] =
K[δ] holds. Further we will go back and forth between the skew polynomial
L and the left K[δ] module M = K[δ]/ K[δ]L. By induction on the degree it
suﬃces to ﬁnd some factorization of L or equivalently some decomposition of M.
Further we note that the formulations 2. and 3. in the theorem are equivalent
by using the ordinary Jordan normal forms of the maps Ci of part 3. We shall
treat questions of uniqueness and descent to K later in the chapter.
Exercise 3.2 Solutions of diﬀerential equations over K
Let E be a diﬀerential extension of K containing:
1. all ﬁelds Km,
2. for any m and any b ∈K∗
m, a nonzero solution of y′ = by,
3. a solution of y′ = 1.
Show, assuming Theorem 3.1, that E contains a fundamental matrix for any
equation Y ′ = AY with A ∈Mn( K).
2
In this section Theorem 3.1 will be proved by means of diﬀerential analogues
of Hensel’s Lemma. In the third section another proof will be given based upon
Newton polygons. We will start by recalling how the classical form of Hensel’s
Lemma allows one to prove that ﬁelds of the form Kn are the only ﬁnite algebraic
extensions of K.
We begin by noting that the ﬁeld Kn = K(z1/n) = C((z1/n)) is itself the ﬁeld
of formal power series over C in the variable z1/n.
This ﬁeld extension has
degree n over K and is a Galois extension of K. The Galois automorphisms σ
are given by the formula σ(z1/n) = ζz1/n with ζ ∈{e2πik/n| 0 ≤k < n}. The
Galois group is isomorphic to Z/nZ. We note that Kn ⊂Km if n divides m.
Therefore it makes sense to speak of the union K = ∪n Kn and our statement
concerning algebraic extensions of K implies that K is the algebraic closure of
K.
We will also need the valuation v on K. This is deﬁned as a map
v : K →Z ∪{∞}

66
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
with v(0) = ∞and v(f) = m if f = 
i≥m aizi and am ̸= 0. We note that
v(fg) = v(f) + v(g) and v(f + g) ≥min(v(f), v(g)). This valuation is extended
to each ﬁeld Kn as a map v : Kn →(1/n)Z∪{∞} in the obvious way: v(f) = λ
if f = 
µ≥λ;nµ∈Z aµzµ and aλ ̸= 0.
Finally v is extended to a valuation
v : K →Q ∪{∞}. Further we will write On = C[[z1/n]] = {f ∈Kn| v(f) ≥0}
and O := {f ∈K| v(f) ≥0}. It is easily seen that On and O are rings with
ﬁelds of quotients Kn and K. The element π := z1/n ∈On has the property
that πOn is the unique maximal ideal of On and that On/πOn ∼= C. On Kn
one can also introduce a metric as follows d(f, g) = e−v(f−g). With respect to
this metric Kn is complete. In the sequel we will talk about limits with respect
to this metric. Most of the statements that we made about the algebraic and
topological structure of K are rather obvious. The only not so obvious statement
is that every ﬁnite extension of K is some ﬁeld Kn. This will follow from:
Proposition 3.3 Every polynomial T d +a1T d−1+· · ·+ad−1T +ad ∈K[T ] has
a root in some Kn.
Proof.
Deﬁne λ := min{ v(ai)
i
| 1 ≤i ≤d} and make the substitution T =
z−λE, where E is a new indeterminate. The new monic polynomial that arises
has the form
P = Ed + b1Ed−1 + · · · + bd−1E + bd
with b1, . . . , bd ∈Km where m is the denominator of λ. Now min v(bi) = 0. We
have that P ∈Om[E] and we write P ∈C[E] for the reduction of P modulo
π := z1/m (i.e., reducing all the coeﬃcients of P modulo π). Note that the fact
that min v(bi) = 0 implies that P has at least two nonzero terms. Note that
v(bi) = 0 precisely for those i with v(ai)
i
= λ. Therefore if v(b1) = 0, we have
that λ is an integer and m = 1. The key for ﬁnding decompositions of P is now
the following lemma.
Lemma 3.4 Classical Hensel’s Lemma
If P = F1F2 with F1, F2 ∈C[E] monic polynomials with g.c.d.(F1, F2) = 1 then
there is a unique decomposition P = P1P2 of P into monic polynomials such
that P i = Fi for i = 1, 2.
Proof.
Suppose that we have already found monic polynomials Q1(k), Q2(k)
such that Qi(k) = Fi (for i = 1, 2) and P ≡Q1(k)Q2(k) modulo πk. Then
deﬁne Qi(k + 1) = Qi(k) + πkRi where Ri ∈C[E] are the unique polynomials
with degree Ri < degree Fi and
R1F2 + R2F1 = P −Q1(k)Q2(k)
πk
modulo π
One easily sees that P ≡Q1(k + 1)Q2(k + 1) modulo πk+1. Deﬁne now
Pi =limk→∞Qi(k) (the limit is taken here for every coeﬃcient separately). It is
easily seen that P1, P2 have the required properties.
2

3.1. FORMAL CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
67
Example 3.5 Let P = y2 −2zy −1 + z2. Then P = y2 −1 = (y −1)(y + 1).
We let Q1(0) = y −1 and Q2(0) = y + 1 and deﬁne Q1(1) = Q0(0) + zR1 and
Q2(1) = Q2(0) + zR2. We then have P −Q1(1)Q2(1) = −2zy −z(y + 1)R1 −
z(y −1)R2 + z2R1R2. Solving −2y = (y + 1)R1 −z(y −1)R2 mod z, we get
R1 = R2 = −1. Therefore Q1(1) = y −1 −z and Q2(1) = y + 1 −z. At this
point we have Q1(1)Q2(1) = P so the procedure stops.
2
Continuation of the proof of Proposition 3.3: We use induction on the
degree d. If P has at least two diﬀerent roots in C then induction ﬁnishes the
proof. If not then P = (E −c0)d for some c0 ∈C. As we have noted, P has at
least two nonzero terms so we have that c0 ̸= 0. This furthermore implies that
P has d + 1 nonzero terms and so m = 1 and λ is an integer. One then writes
P = (E −c0)d + e1(E −c0)d−1 + · · · + ed−1(E −c0) + ed
with all v(ei) > 0. Put λ1 =min { v(ei)
i
| 1 ≤i ≤d} and make the substitution
E = c0 + zλ1E∗. It is then possible that an application of Lemma 3.4 yields
a factorization and we will be done by induction.
If not, we can conclude
as above that λ1 is an integer.
We then make a further substitution E =
c0 + c1zλ1 + zλ2E∗∗with 0 < λ1 < λ2 and continue. If we get a factorization
at any stage using Lemma 3.4, then induction ﬁnishes the proof. If not, we will
have generated an inﬁnite expression f := ∞
n=0 cnzλn with 0 < λ1 < λ2 < ..
a sequence of integers such that P = (E −f)d.
This ﬁnishes the proof of
Proposition 3.3.
2
Example 3.6 Let P = E2 −2zE + z2 −z3.
We have that P = E2 and
(using the above notation) that e1 = −2z and e2 = z2 −z3.
Furthermore,
λ1 = min{ 1
1, 2
2} = 1. We then let E = zE∗, so Q = z2E∗2 −2z2E∗+ z2 −z3.
Let Q1 = E∗2 −2E∗+ 1 −z. We see that Q1 = E∗2 −2E∗+ 1 = (E∗−1)2. We
write Q1 = (E∗−1)2−z and so λ2 = min{ ∞
1 , 1
2} = 1/2. We let E∗= 1+z1/2E∗∗
and so Q1 = (z1/2E∗∗)2 −z = zE∗∗2 −z. Letting Q2 = E∗∗2 −1, we have that
E∗∗= ±1. The process stops at this point and we have that the two roots of Q
are 1 + z(1 ± z1/2).

3.1.1
Regular Singular Equations
We will now develop versions of Hensel’s Lemma for diﬀerential modules and
diﬀerential equations that will help us prove Theorem 3.1. We start by intro-
ducing some terminology. Let M be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over K.
Let, as before, O := {f ∈K| v(f) ≥0}.
Deﬁnition 3.7 A lattice is a subset N of M of the form N = Oe1 + · · · + Oed
where e1, . . . , ed is a K-basis of M.
2
The lattice is itself an O-module. One can prove that any ﬁnitely generated
O-module N (i.e. there are elements f1, . . . , fm with N = Of1 + · · · + Ofm) of

68
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
M which contains a basis of M is a lattice. For a lattice N we introduce the
space N = N/πN where π = z. This is a vector space over C with dimension
d. The image of n ∈N in N will be denoted by n. Properties that we will often
use are:
Exercise 3.8 Lattices.
(1) f1, . . . , fm ∈N are generators of N over O if and only if f1, . . . , fm are
generators of the vector space N over C. Hint: Nakayama’s Lemma ([169], Ch.
X, §4).
(2) f1, . . . , fd ∈N is a free basis of N over O if and only if f 1, . . . , fd is a basis
of the vector space N over C.
2
Although lattices are ubiquitous, only special diﬀerential modules have δ-
invariant lattices.
Deﬁnition 3.9 A diﬀerential module M is said to be a regular singular module
if there exists a δ-invariant lattice N in M. A diﬀerential equation Y ′ = AY ,
A an n × n matrix with coeﬃcients in K, is said to be regular singular if the
associated module is regular singular. If M is not regular singular then we say
it is irregular singular.
2
The diﬀerential module associated with an equation of the form δY = AY
where A ∈Mn(C[[z]]) is a regular singular module. In particular, any equation
of the form δY = AY where A ∈Mn(C) is a regular singular equation. In
Proposition 3.12 we will show that all regular singular modules are associated
with such an equation.
Lemma 3.10 If M1 and M2 are regular singular modules, then the same holds
for M1⊕M2, M1⊗M2 and M ∗
1 . Furthermore, any K[δ] submodule and quotient
module of a regular singular module is regular singular.
Proof.
Let N1 and N2 be δ-invariant lattices in M1 and M2. A calculation
shows that N1⊕N2, N1⊗N2 and N ∗
1 are δ-invariant lattices in the corresponding
K[∂] modules. If M is a regular singular module with δ-invariant lattice N and
M ′ is a submodule of M, then N ∩M ′ is a δ-invariant lattice of M ′. Using
duals and applying this result, we obtain a similar result for quotients.
2
Let M be a regular singular module and let N be a δ-invariant lattice. We
have that πN is invariant under δ and hence δ induces a C linear map δ on N.
Let c1, · · · , cs denote the distinct eigenvalues of δ and let N = N(c1)⊕· · ·⊕N(cs)
denote the decomposition of N into generalized eigenspaces. One can choose
elements ei,j ∈N with 1 ≤i ≤s and 1 ≤j ≤mi such that {ei,j| 1 ≤j ≤mi}
forms a basis of N(ci) for every i. Then we know that {ei,j} is a free basis of
the O-module N. We deﬁne now another δ-invariant lattice N1 generated over
O by the set {ze1,1, · · · , ze1,m, e2,1, · · · , es,ms}. The linear map δ on N1 has as
eigenvalues {c1 + 1, c2, · · · , cs}. We come now to the following conclusion:

3.1. FORMAL CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
69
Lemma 3.11 If M is a regular singular diﬀerential module, then there exists a
δ-invariant lattice N in M such that the eigenvalues c1, · · · , cs of δ on N have
the property: If ci −cj ∈Z then ci = cj.
Proposition 3.12 A regular singular equation δY = AY is equivalent to an
equation of the form δY = A0Y with A0 ∈Mn(C) and such that the distinct
eigenvalues of A0 do not diﬀer by integers.
Proof.
We begin with a well known fact from linear algebra.
Let U, V ∈
Mn(C) and assume that U and V have no eigenvalues in common. We claim
that the map X →UX −XV is an isomorphism on Mn(C). To prove this it
is enough to show that the map is injective. If UX −XV = 0 then for any
P ∈C[T ], P(U)X −XP(V ) = 0. If PU is the characteristic polynomial of U,
then the assumptions imply that PU(V ) is invertible. Therefore X = 0.
We now turn to the proof of the proposition. With respect to the basis of a δ-
invariant lattice, we can assume the associated equation is of the form δY = AY
with A ∈C[[z]]. Let A = A0 + A1z + · · · , Ai ∈Mn(C). Furthermore, by
Lemma 3.11, we may assume that the distinct eigenvalues of A0 do not diﬀer by
integers. We will construct a matrix P = I + P1z + · · · , Pi ∈Mn(C) such that
PA0 = AP −δP. This will show that δY = AY is equivalent to δY = A0Y .
Comparing powers of t, one sees that
A0Pi −Pi(A0 + iI) = −(Ai + Ai−1P1 + · · · + A1Pi−1) .
Our assumption on the eigenvalues of A0 implies that we can solve these equa-
tions recursively yielding the desired P.
2
The above proposition combined with the Jordan form of the matrix A0
proves part 2. and part 3. of Theorem 3.1 for the special case where the diﬀer-
ential equation is regular singular. We will give another proof using a form of
Hensel’s lemma for regular singular diﬀerential modules. This prepares the way
for the irregular singular case.
Exercise 3.13 Solutions of regular singular equations.
The following result, in a somewhat diﬀerent form, is attributed to Frobenius.
Let E be a diﬀerential extension of K containing a solution of δy = 1 and such
that for any c ∈C∗, E contains a nonzero solution of δy = cy. This solution
will be denoted by zc.
Show that any regular singular diﬀerential equation
δY = AY, A ∈Mn( K) has a nonzero solution of the form zaφ where φ ∈Kn
and a fundamental matrix with entries in E. Hint: Use Proposition 3.12 and
Jordan forms. A converse of this Exercise 3.13 is given in Exercise 3.29.
2
For diﬀerential operators one can also deﬁne the property “regular singular”.
Deﬁnition 3.14 A diﬀerential operator L = δd + a1δd−1 + · · · + ad−1δ + ad ∈
K[δ] is said to be a regular singular operator if all v(ai) ≥0.

70
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
Exercise 3.15 Factors of regular singular operators.
In this exercise we indicate the proof of a Gauss lemma for operators in K[δ].
This result is in fact a special case of Lemma 3.45. As before a′ := z da
dz and
a(i+1) := z da(i)
dz
for i ≥0.
(1) Prove for a ∈K the formula

a(2)δs−2 + · · · +

a(s).
(2) Let L1, L2 be monic diﬀerential operators such that L1L2 is regular sin-
gular (i.e., has its coeﬃcients in O). Show that L1 and L2 are both regular
singular.
Hint: Choose non-negative powers am, bn of z such that all coef-
ﬁcients of amL1 = m
i=0 aiδi and of L2bn = n
i=0 biδi are in O and more-
over (am, am−1, . . . , a0) = O and (bn, bn−1, . . . , b0) = O. Write amL1L2bn =
m+n
k=0 ckδk. Use (1) to show that all ci ∈O. Prove that (cm+n, . . . , c0) = O
by reducing the coeﬃcients modulo the maximal ideal (z) of O. Conclude that
am = bn = 1.
(3) Verify that (2) remains valid if the ﬁeld K is replaced by the ﬁeld C({z})
of convergent Laurent series.
2
Proposition 3.16 Let M be a diﬀerential module of dimension d over K with
cyclic vector e. Let L be the monic polynomial of minimal degree with Le = 0.
Then M is regular singular if and only if L is regular singular.
The same statement holds with K replaced by the ﬁeld C({z}) of convergent
Laurent series.
Proof.
Suppose that L is regular singular, then e, δ(e), · · · , δd−1(e) is a basis
of M.
The lattice N := Oe + Oδ(e) + · · · + Oδd−1(e) is invariant under δ.
Indeed δde ∈N since the coeﬃcients of the monic L are in O.
Thus M is
regular singular.
Suppose that M is regular singular and let N be a δ-invariant lattice. For
any f ∈K∗, the lattice fN is also δ-invariant.
Therefore we may suppose
that e ∈N. Consider the O-submodule N ′ of N generated by all δme. Since
O is noetherian, N ′ is ﬁnitely generated and thus a δ-invariant lattice.
By
Exercise 3.8 there are indices i1 < i2 < · · · < id such that δi1e, . . . , δide is a free
basis of N ′ over O. Then δδide is an O-linear combination of δi1e, . . . , δide. In
other words there is a monic diﬀerential operator ˜L with coeﬃcients in O such
that ˜Le = 0. The operator L is a monic right hand factor of ˜L. By Exercise 3.15,
L is a regular singular operator.
For the last part of the proposition, we have to deﬁne regular singular for an
operator L and for a diﬀerential module M over C({z}). The obvious deﬁnitions
are L = δn + an−1δn−1 + · · · + a0 with all ai ∈C{z} and M has a C{z}-lattice
which is invariant under δ.
2
We now return to regular singular modules and prove:

3.1. FORMAL CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
71
Proposition 3.17 Hensel’s Lemma for regular singular modules
Let N denote a δ-invariant lattice of the left K[δ] module M of ﬁnite dimension
over K. Let a direct sum decomposition of N into δ-invariant subspaces F1, F2
be given such that for any eigenvalue c of δ on F1 and any eigenvalue d of δ on
F2 one has c −d ̸∈Z. Then there exists a unique decomposition N = N1 ⊕N2
of N into δ-invariant O-modules such that Ni = Fi for i = 1, 2. In particular
M admits a direct sum decomposition as a left K[δ]-module.
Proof.
For each n we shall construct C-subspaces F1(n), F2(n) of N/πn+1N
such that
1. N/πn+1N = F1(n) ⊕F2(n),
2. The Fi(n) are invariant under δ and multiplication by π,
3. The map N/πn+1N →N/πnN maps Fi(n) onto Fi(n −1).
Once we have shown this, the spaces Ni constructed by taking the limits of the
Fi(n) give the desired direct sum decomposition of N.
Let S1 and S2 be the set of eigenvalues of δ acting on F1 and F2 respec-
tively. Since πn+1N is invariant under δ, the map δ induces a C-linear map on
N/πn+1N. We will again denote this map by δ. We will ﬁrst show that the eigen-
values of δ on N/πn+1N lie in (S1+Z)∪(S2+Z). Since each V (n) = πnN/πn+1N
is invariant under the action of δ, it is enough to show this claim for each V (n).
If πnv, v ∈V (0) is an eigenvalue of δ, then
δ(πnv) = nπnv + πnδ(v) = cπnv
for some c ∈C. Therefore c ∈(S1 +Z)∪(S2 +Z). We therefore deﬁne F1(n) to
be the sum of the generalized eigenspaces of δ corresponding to eigenvalues in
S1+Z and F2(n) to be the sum of the generalized eigenspaces of δ corresponding
to eigenvalues in S2 + Z. By the assumptions of the lemma and what we have
just shown, N/πn+1N = F1(n)⊕F2(n). Items 2. and 3. above are easily checked.
The uniqueness follows from the fact that the image of each Ni in πnN/πn+1N
is the image of Fi under the map Fi →πnFi.
2
We are now in a position to prove part 3. of Theorem 3.1 under the additional
assumption that the module M is regular singular. Lemma 3.11 and Proposition
3.17 imply that M can be decomposed as a direct sum of modules Mi such that
Mi admits a δ-invariant lattice Ni such that δ has only one eigenvalue ci on N i.
The next step will be to decompose each Mi into indecomposable pieces.
From now on let M denote a regular singular module with a δ-invariant
lattice such that δ has only one eigenvalue c on N. By changing δ into δ −c one
may suppose that c = 0. Therefore δ is a nilpotent linear map on N and there

72
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
is a “block decomposition” of N as a direct sum of δ- invariant subspaces N(i)
with i = 1, . . . , a such that each N(i) has a basis {fi,1, . . . , fi,si} with
δfi,1 = fi,2, · · · , δfi,si−1 = fi,si, δfi,si = 0
One tries to lift this decomposition to N. Suppose that one has found elements
ei,j such that ei,j = fi,j and such that δ(ei,j) ≡ei,j+1 modulo πk for all i, j
and where ei,j = 0 for j > si. One then needs to determine elements ˜ei,j =
ei,j + πkai,j with ai,j ∈N such that the same congruences hold now modulo
πk+1. A calculation shows that the ai,j are determined by congruences of the
form
(δ + k)ai,j = δ(ei,j) −ei,j+1
πk
+ ai,j+1 modulo π
Since δ + k is invertible modulo π when k > 0, these congruences can be re-
cursively solved. Taking the limit of this sequence of liftings of fi,j one ﬁnds
elements Ei,j such that Ei,j = fi,j with δ(Ei,j) = Ei,j+1 for all i, j and where
again Ei,j = 0 for j > si. We will leave the construction of the ai,j to the
reader. This ﬁnishes the study of the regular singular case.
Remark 3.18 We will discuss the Galois group of a regular singular module in
the Section 3.2 and return to the study of regular singular equations in Chapters
5 and 6.
2
3.1.2
Irregular Singular Equations
We now turn to the general case. Let e denote a cyclic element of a left K[∂]
module M of ﬁnite dimension and let the minimal equation of e be Le = 0
where
L = δd + a1δd−1 + · · · + ad−1δ + ad ∈K[∂]
We may assume that λ :=min { v(ai)
i
| 1 ≤i ≤d} is negative since we have
already dealt with the regular singular case. Now we imitate the method of
Proposition 3.3 and write δ = z−λE. The skew polynomial L is then trans-
formed into a skew polynomial
P := Ed + b1Ed−1 + · · · + bd−1E + bd
with min v(bi) = 0 and so P ∈C[[z1/m]][E] where m is the denominator of λ.
Consider the lattice N = Ome + OmE(e) + · · · + OmEd−1(e) in Km ⊗M where
Om := C[[z1/m]]. The lattice N is E-invariant. Let π denote z1/m. Also πN
is E-invariant and E induces a C-linear map, called E, on the d-dimensional
vector space N = N/πN. As in the regular singular case there is a lemma
about lifting E-invariant subspaces to E-invariant submodules of N. We will
formulate this for the ground ﬁeld K, although a similar statement holds over
Kn.

3.1. FORMAL CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
73
Proposition 3.19 Hensel’s Lemma for irregular singular modules
Let M denote a left K[∂]-module of ﬁnite dimension; let E = zαδ with α ∈Z
and α > 0; let N denote an E-invariant lattice and let N := N/πN where π = z.
Let N = F1 ⊕F2 be a direct sum decomposition where F1, F2 are E-invariant
subspaces such that E|F1 and E|F2 have no common eigenvalue. Then there are
unique E-invariant O-submodules N1, N2 of N with N = N1 ⊕N2 and Ni = Fi
for i = 1, 2.
Proof.
The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 3.17. Let S1 and S2
be the set of eigenvalues of E acting on F1 and F2 respectively. Since πnN is
invariant under E, the map E induces a C linear map on N/πn+1N. We will
again denote this map by E. A calculation similar to that given in the proof of
Proposition 3.17 shows that the eigenvalues of E on N/πn+1N are again S1∪S2.
We therefore deﬁne F1(n) to be the sum of the generalized eigenspaces of E
corresponding to eigenvalues in S1 and F2(n) to be the sum of the generalized
eigenspaces of E corresponding to eigenvalues in S2. By the assumptions of the
lemma and what we have just shown, N/πn+1N = F1(n)⊕F2(n). Taking limits
as before yields the Ni.
2
We are now ready to prove Theorem 3.1 in its full generality.
If we can
apply Proposition 3.19 to get a decomposition of Km ⊗M, then the proof can
be ﬁnished using induction. If no decomposition occurs then the characteristic
polynomial of E has the form (T −c)d for some c ∈C and m = 1 follows as
in the proof of Proposition 3.3. Make now the substitution δ = czλ + tµE∗∗
with a suitable choice for µ > λ. If for the operator E∗∗still no decomposition
occurs then µ is an integer and one continues. Either one will be able to apply
Proposition 3.19 or one will generate a sequence of integers λ1 < λ2 < · · · .
These integers must eventually become positive, at which point the operator
D = δ −r
i=1 cizi/m acts on Km ⊗M so that this module is regular singular.
In this case we are in a situation that we have already studied. The process
that we have described yields a decomposition of Km ⊗M as a direct sum ⊕Mi
such that for each i there is some qi ∈z−1/mC[z−1/m] with δ −qi acts in a
regular singular way on Mi. Our discussion of regular singular modules now
proves part 3. of the theorem. After choosing a basis of each space Wi such that
Ci has Jordan normal form one ﬁnds statement 2. of the theorem. Finally, for
every M there exists an integer m ≥1 such that Km ⊗M has a submodule of
dimension 1. This proves part 1. of the theorem.
Remarks 3.20 1. Theorem 3.1 and its proof are valid for any diﬀerential ﬁeld
k((z)), where k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of chararteristic 0. Indeed, in the
proof given above, we have used no more than the fact that C is algebraically
closed and has characteristic 0.
2. Let k be any ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and let k denotes its algebraic closure.
The above proof of Theorem 3.1 can be applied to a diﬀerential module M over
k((z)). In some steps of the proof a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of k is needed. It follows

74
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
that Theorem 3.1 remains valid in this case with Km replaced by k′((z1/m)) for
a suitable ﬁnite ﬁeld extension k′ of k. Further the q, . . . , qs in part 3. are now
elements in z−1/mk′[z−1/m].
3. Concerning part 1. of the Theorem one can say that the module K[∂]/ K[∂]L
has, after a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension, at least one (and possibly many) 1-dimensional
submodules. Hence there are elements u algebraic over K such that L decom-
poses as L = L2(∂−u). Any such u can be seen as u = y′
y where y is a solution
of Ly = 0. The element u itself satisﬁes a non linear equation of order d −1.
This equation is called the Riccati equation of L and has the form
Pd + ad−1Pd−1 + · · · + a1P1 + a0P0 = 0
where the Pi are deﬁned by induction as follows: P0 = 1; Pi = P ′
i−1 + uPi−1.
One has P1 = u, P2 = u′ + u2, P3 = u′′ + 3uu′ + u3 et cetera.
4. The proof given above of Theorem 3.1 does not readily yield an eﬃcient
method for factoring an operator L over K. In Section 3.3 we shall present a
second proof that gives a more eﬃcient method.
5. In parts 2. and 3. of Theorem 3.1 an extra condition is needed to assure
that the given decomposition actually comes of something over K and not of an
equation or a module which can only be deﬁned over some proper extension of
K. Another point is to know some unicity of the decompositions. Let us already
state that the q1, . . . , qs in 3. are unique. We see these elements as “eigenvalues”
of the operator δ on M. We will return to those questions after the introduction,
in the next section, of a universal Picard-Vessiot ring UnivR

K ⊃K.
6. A left K[δ] module M of ﬁnite dimension over K is called irreducible if M
has no proper submodules. From the theorem one can deduce that any such
irreducible M must have dimension 1 over K and so M = Ke for some element
e. Then δ(e) = Fe for some F ∈K. A change of e into ge with g ∈K and
g ̸= 0 changes F into f = F + g′
g . Hence we can choose the basis of M such
that f ∈∪n≥1C[z−1/n]. Let us call M(f) the module Ke with δ(e) = fe and
f ∈∪n≥1C[z−1/n]. Then M(f1) ∼= M(f2) if and only f1 −f2 ∈Q.
7. Another statement which follows from the theorem is that every irreducible
element of K[δ] has degree 1.
8. M. Bouﬀet gives version of Hensel’s Lemma for operators with coeﬃcients in
liouvillian extensions of C((z)) in [46, 47].

Exercise 3.21 Let k be any ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and let k denote its alge-
braic closure. Put K = k ⊗k k((z)) and K = k((z)). Then K is in a natural
way a diﬀerential subﬁeld of K.

(a) Prove that K = K if and only if [k : k] < ∞.
(b) Suppose that k is an inﬁnite extension of k. Prove that Theorem 3.1 remains
valid for diﬀerential modules over K.
(c) Prove the following more precise formulation of part (b), namely:
The functor M →K ⊗K M from the category of the diﬀerential modules over
K to the category of the diﬀerential modules over K is an equivalence of (Tan-
nakian) categories.

3.2
The Universal Picard-Vessiot Ring of K
The aim is to construct a diﬀerential extension UnivR

K of K, such that the
diﬀerential ring UnivR

K has the following properties:
1. UnivR

K is a simple diﬀerential ring, i.e., the only diﬀerential ideals of
UnivR

K are 0 and UnivR

K.
2. Every matrix diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay over K has a fundamental
matrix F ∈GLn(UnivR

K).
3. UnivR

K is minimal in the sense that UnivR

K is generated over K by all
the entries of F and
1
det F of the fundamental matrices F of all matrix
diﬀerential equations y′ = Ay over K.
One can prove that for any diﬀerential ﬁeld, with an algebraically closed
ﬁeld C of constants of characteristic 0, such a ring exists and is unique up
to isomorphism (see Chapter 10). The ring UnivR

K can be constructed as the
direct limit of all Picard-Vessiot rings of matrix diﬀerential equations. Moreover
UnivR

K is a domain and its ﬁeld of fractions has again C as ﬁeld of constants.
The situation is rather similar to the existence and uniqueness of an algebraic
closure of a ﬁeld. Let us call UnivR the universal Picard-Vessiot ring of the
diﬀerential ﬁeld. The interesting feature is that UnivR

K can be constructed
explicitly for the diﬀerential ﬁeld K = C((z)).
Intuitive idea for the construction of UnivR
 K.
As before we will use the derivation δ = z ∂
∂z and the notation y′ shall refer to
δy. Since UnivR

K must contain the entries of fundamental matrices for linear
diﬀerential equations over K, UnivR

K must contain solutions to all equations
of the form y′ =
1
my for m ∈Z. Any matrix diﬀerential equation (of size n)
over the ﬁeld K(z1/m) can be rewritten as a matrix diﬀerential equation (of size
nm) over K (see Exercise 1.14.7). Thus every order one equation y′ = ay with
a in the algebraic closure of K must have a solution y ∈UnivR∗

K. Furthermore,
UnivR

K must contain a solution of the equation y′ = 1.
From the formal
classiﬁcation (see Exercise 3.2), we conclude that no more is needed for the

76
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
existence of a fundamental matrix for any matrix equation y′ = Ay over K (and
over the algebraic closure of K).
To insure that we construct UnivR

K correctly we will need to understand the
relations among solutions of the various y′ = ay. Therefore, we need to clas-
sify the order one equations y′ = ay over the algebraic closure K of K. Two
equations y′ = ay and y′ = by are equivalent if and only if b = a + f ′
f for some
f ∈K, f ̸= 0. The set Log := { f ′
f | f ∈K, f ̸= 0} is easily seen to consist
of the elements of K of the form c + 
n>0 cnzn/m, with c ∈Q, cn ∈C and
m ∈Z>0. The quotient group K/Log classiﬁes the order one homogeneous
equations over K. One chooses a Q-vector space M ⊂C such that M ⊕Q = C.
Put Q = ∪m≥1z−1/mC[z−1/m]. Then M ⊕Q ⊂K maps bijectively to K/Log,
and classiﬁes the order one homogeneous equations over K. For each element
in K/Log, the ring UnivR

K must contain an invertible element which is the
solution of the corresponding order one homogeneous equation. We separate
the equations corresponding to M and to Q. We note that this separation is
immaterial for diﬀerential equations over K. In contrast, the separation is very
important for the study of equations over the ﬁeld of convergent Laurent series
C({z}). The equations corresponding to M turn out to be regular singular.
The elements in Q form the basis for the study of asymptotic properties of dif-
ferential equations over C({z}).
The ring UnivR

K must then have the form K[{za}a∈M, {e(q)}q∈Q, l], with the
following rules:
1. the only relations between the symbols are z0 = 1, za+b = zazb, e(0) =
1, e(q1 + q2) = e(q1)e(q2).
2. the diﬀerentiation in UnivR

K is given by (za)′ = aza, e(q)′ = qe(q), l′ = 1.
One may object to the Q-vector space M ⊂C, since it is not constructive.
Indeed, the following equivalent deﬁnition of UnivR

K is more natural.
Let
UnivR

K = K[{za}a∈C, {e(q)}q∈Q, l], with the following rules:
1. the only relations between the symbols are za+b = zazb, za = za ∈K for
a ∈Z, e(q1 + q2) = e(q1)e(q2), e(0) = 1.
2. the diﬀerentiation in UnivR

K is given by (za)′ = aza, e(q)′ = qe(q), l′ = 1.
We prefer the ﬁrst description since it involves fewer relations. The intuitive
interpretation of the symbols is:
1. za is the function ea log(z),
2. l is the function log(z) and

3.2. THE UNIVERSAL PICARD-VESSIOT RING OF K
77
3. e(q) is the function exp(

q dz
z ).
In a sector S at z = 0, S ̸= S1, this interpretation makes sense.
Formal construction of the universal Picard-Vessiot ring.
Deﬁne the ring R = K[{Za}a∈M, {E(q)}q∈Q, L] as the polynomial ring over K
in the inﬁnite collection of variables {Za}a∈M ∪{E(q)}q∈Q ∪{L}. Deﬁne the
diﬀerentiation ′ on R by: ′ is z d
dz on K, (Za)′ = aZa, E(q)′ = qE(q) and L′ = 1.
Let I ⊂R denote the ideal generated by the elements
Z0 −1, Za+b −ZaZb, E(0) −1, E(q1 + q2) −E(q1)E(q2).
It is easily seen that I is a diﬀerential ideal and I ̸= UnivR

K. Put UnivR

K :=
R/I. Then UnivR

K coincides with the intuitive description that we made above.
By construction, UnivR

K has the properties 2.
and 3.
deﬁning a universal
Picard-Vessiot ring. We want to prove that UnivR

K also satisﬁes property 1.
and has some more pleasant features:
Proposition 3.22 Properties of UnivR

K.
1. UnivR

K has no diﬀerential ideals, diﬀerent from 0 and UnivR

K.
2. UnivR

K is a domain.
3. The ﬁeld of fractions UnivF

K of UnivR

K has C as ﬁeld of constants.
Proof.
Consider elements m1, . . . , ms ∈M and q1, . . . , qt ∈Q, linearly inde-
pendent over Q. Consider the diﬀerential subring
˜R := K[zm1, z−m1, . . . , zms, z−ms, e(q1), e(−q1), . . . , e(qt), e(−qt), l]
of UnivR

K.
The ring UnivR

K is the union of diﬀerential subrings of the
type ˜R.
It suﬃces to prove that ˜R has only trivial diﬀerential ideals, that
˜R is a domain and that the ﬁeld of constants of the ﬁeld of fractions of ˜R
is C.
One observes that ˜R is the localization of the “free” polynomial ring
K[zm1, . . . , zms, e(q1), . . . , e(qt), l] with respect to the element zm1 ·zm2 · · · zms ·
e(q1) · e(q2) · · · e(qt). Thus ˜R has no zero divisors. Let J ̸= (0) be a diﬀerential
ideal in ˜R. We have to show that J = R.
This is a combinatorial exercise. Let (only for this proof) a “monomial m” be
a term zae(q) with a ∈Zm1 + · · · + Zms and q ∈Zq1 + · · · + Zqt. Let M be
the set of all monomials. We note that m′ = α(m)m holds with α(m) ∈K
∗
.
Any f ∈˜R can be written as 
m∈M,n≥0 fm,nmln. The derivative of f is then
(f ′
m,n +α(m)fm,n)mln + nfm,nmln−1. Let us ﬁrst prove that a diﬀerential
ideal J0 ̸= (0) of the smaller ring
˜R0 := K[zm1, z−m1, . . . , zms, z−ms, e(q1), e(−q1), . . . , e(qt), e(−qt)]

78
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
is necessarily equal to ˜R0.
Choose f ∈J0, f ̸= 0 with f = N
i=1 fim(i) and N ≥1 minimal. After
multiplying f with an invertible element of the ring ˜R0, we may suppose that
f1 = 1 and m(1) = 1. If N happens to be 1, then the proof ends. For N > 1,
the derivative f ′ lies in J0 and must be zero according to the minimality of N.
Then fN ∈K
∗
satisﬁes f ′
N + α(m(N))fN = 0. Since f ′
N/fN has a rational
constant term and no terms of negative degree, this is in contradiction with the
construction of M ⊕Q. Thus ˜R0 has only trivial diﬀerential ideals.
We continue with a diﬀerential ideal J ⊂˜R, J ̸= (0). Choose n0 ≥0 minimal
such that J contains an expression which has degree n0 with respect to the
variable l. If n0 = 0, then J ∩˜R0 is a non zero diﬀerential ideal of ˜R0 and the
proof ends. Suppose that n0 > 0. Let J0 ⊂˜R0 denote the set of coeﬃcients of
ln0 of all elements in J which have degree ≤n0 with respect to the variable l.
Then J0 is seen to be a diﬀerential ideal of ˜R0 and thus J0 = ˜R0. Therefore
J contains an element of the form f = ln0 + hln0−1 + · · · , with h ∈˜R0. The
derivative f ′ must be zero, according to the minimality of n0. Thus n0 +h′ = 0.
Write h = 
m∈M hmm, with coeﬃcients hm ∈K. Then n0 + h′ = 0 implies
that n0 + h′
0 = 0 for some h0 ∈K. This is again a contradiction.
Consider the collection of equations
y′
1 = m1y1, . . . , y′
s = msys, f ′
1 = q1f1, . . . , f ′
t = qtft, g′′ = 0.
This can be seen as a matrix diﬀerential equation of size s + t + 2. We have
in fact proven above that the ring ˜R is the Picard-Vessiot ring for this matrix
equation over K. It follows from the Picard-Vessiot theory that ˜R is a domain
and that its ﬁeld of fractions has C as set of constants.

Remarks 3.24 1. A matrix diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay over K = C((z)), or
over its algebraic closure K will be called canonical if the matrix A is a direct
sum of square blocks Ai and each block Ai has the form qiI + Ci, where the
qi are distinct elements of Q and Ci is a constant matrix. One can reﬁne this
block decomposition by replacing each block qiI +Ci by blocks qiI +Ci,j, where
the constant matrices Ci,j are the blocks of the usual Jordan decomposition of
the Ci.
The matrices Ci and Ci,j are not completely unique since one may translate the
eigenvalues of Ci and Ci,j over rational numbers. If one insists on using only
eigenvalues in the Q-vector space M ⊂C, then the matrices Ci and Ci,j are
unique up to conjugation by constant matrices.
2. Let y′ = Ay be a diﬀerential equation over K = C((z)) or over its algebraic
closure K. Then there exists a H ∈GLn( K) which transforms this equation to

3.2. THE UNIVERSAL PICARD-VESSIOT RING OF K
79
the canonical form y′ = Acy. This means that that Ac = H−1AH −H−1H′.
For the canonical equation y′ = Acy one has a “symbolic” fundamental matrix,
fund(Ac) with coeﬃcients in UnivR

K, which uses only the symbols za, e(q), l.
The fundamental matrix for the original equation is then H ·fund(Ac). A funda-
mental matrix of a similar form appears in the work of Turrittin [287, 288] where
the symbols are replaced by the multivalued functions za, exp( q dz
z ), log(z),
and the fundamental matrix has the form HzLeQ, where H is an invertible
matrix with entries in K, where L is a constant matrix (i.e. with coeﬃcients
in C), where zL means elog(z)L, where Q is a diagonal matrix with entries in Q
and such that the matrices L and Q commute.
We note that Turrittin’s formulation is a priori somewhat vague. One prob-
lem is that a product fexp(

q dz
z ), with f ∈K and q ∈Q is not given a
meaning. The multivalued functions may also present problems. The form of
the fundamental matrix is not unique. Finally, one does not distinguish between
canonical forms over K and over K. The above presentation formalizes Turrit-
tin’s work and also allows us to classify diﬀerential equations over K by giving
a structure on the solution space of the equations. We shall do this in the next
section.
2
A structure on the solution space V .
The ﬁeld K has many K-automorphisms. One of them is γ given by the
formula γ(zλ) = e2πiλzλ for all rational numbers λ (and extended to Laurent
series in the obvious way). This γ and its further action on various spaces and
rings is called the formal monodromy . One can show that the Galois group of
K over K is equal to Z, the inverse limit of the family {Z/mZ} ([169], Ch. VIII
§11, Ex. 20), and that γ is a topological generator of this compact group. The
latter statement follows from the easily veriﬁed fact that the set of γ-invariant
elements of K is precisely K.
The γ as deﬁned above also acts on Q, seen as a subset of K. We deﬁne the
formal monodromy γ of the universal Picard-Vessiot ring UnivR

K by:
1. γ acts on K as explained above.
2. γza = e2πiaza for a ∈C.
3. γe(q) = e(γq) for q ∈Q.
4. γl = l + 2πi.
It is not hard to see that γ is a well deﬁned diﬀerential automorphism of UnivR

K
(and also of its ﬁeld of fractions UnivF

K). We introduce still other diﬀeren-
tial automorphisms of UnivR

K over K. Let Hom(Q, C∗) denote the group of
the homomorphisms of Q to the (multiplicative) group C∗. In other words,

80
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
Hom(Q, C∗) is the group of the characters of Q. Let an element h in this group
be given. Then one deﬁnes a diﬀerential automorphism σh of UnivR

K by
σh(l) = l, σh(za) = za, σhe(q) = h(q)e(q) for a ∈C, q ∈Q
The group of all σh introduced by J.-P. Ramis [201, 202], is called the exponential
torus and we will denote this group by T . It is a large commutative group. γ
does not commute with the elements of T . Indeed, one has the following relation:
γσh′ = σhγ where h′ is deﬁned by h′(q) = h(γq) for all q ∈Q.
Proposition 3.25 Let UnivF

K denote the ﬁeld of fractions of UnivR

K. Sup-
pose that f ∈UnivF

K is invariant under γ and T . Then f ∈K.
Proof.
The element f belongs to the ﬁeld of fractions of a free polynomial sub-
ring P := K[zm1, . . . , zms, e(q1), . . . , e(qt), l] of UnivR

K, where the m1, . . . , ms ∈
M and the q1, . . . , qt ∈Q are linearly independent over Q. Write f = f1
f2 with
f1, f2 ∈P and with g.c.d. 1. One can normalize f2 such that it contains a term
(zm1)n1 · · · (zms)ns · e(q1)b1 · · · e(qt)btln with coeﬃcient 1. For h ∈Hom(Q, C∗)
one has σh(f1) = c(h)f1 and σh(f2) = c(h)f2, with a priori c(h) ∈K
∗
. Due to
the normalization of f2, we have that c(h) = h(b1q1 +· · ·+btqt). One concludes
that f1 and f2 cannot contain the variables e(q1), . . . , e(qt). Thus f lies in the
ﬁeld of fractions of K[zm1, . . . , zms, l]. Applying γ to f = f1
f2 we ﬁnd at once
that l is not present in f1 and f2. A similar reasoning as above shows that in
fact f ∈K.
2
We consider a diﬀerential equation over K and want to associate with it a
solution space with additional structure. For convenience, we suppose that this
diﬀerential equation is given as a scalar equation Ly = 0 of order d over K.
The set of all solutions V (L) in the universal Picard-Vessiot ring UnivR

K is
a vector space over C of dimension d. The ring UnivR

K has a decomposition
as UnivR

K = ⊕q∈QRq, where Rq := K[{za}, l]e(q). Put V (L)q := V (L) ∩Rq.
Since the action of L on UnivR

K leaves each Rq invariant, one has V (L) =
⊕q∈QV (L)q. This is a direct sum of vector spaces over C, and of course V (L)q
can only be nonzero for ﬁnitely many elements q ∈Q. The formal monodromy
γ acts on UnivR

K and leaves V (L) invariant. Thus we ﬁnd an induced action
γL on V (L). From γ(e(q)) = e(γq) it follows that γLV (L)q = V (L)γq.
Deﬁnition 3.26 An element q ∈Q is called an eigenvalue of L if V (L)q ̸= 0.
Exercise 3.27 Eigenvalues I
Let L1 and L2 be equivalent operators with coeﬃcients in K. Show that the
eigenvalues of L1 and L2 are the same.
2
The previous exercise implies that we can make the following deﬁnition

3.2. THE UNIVERSAL PICARD-VESSIOT RING OF K
81
Deﬁnition 3.28 The eigenvalues of a diﬀerential equation or module are the
eigenvalues of any linear operator associated with these objects.
2
Exercise 3.29 Eigenvalues II
Let M be a diﬀerential module over K. Show that the eigenvalues of M are all
0 if and only if the module is regular singular. Therefore if a singular diﬀerential
equation has a fundamental matrix with entries in K[{za}, l], then it is regular
singular. This gives a converse to Exercise 3.13.
2
We introduce now a category Gr1, whose objects are the triples (V, {Vq}, γV )
satisfying:
1. V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C.
2. {Vq}q∈Q is a family of subspaces such that V = ⊕Vq.
3. γV is a C-linear automorphism of V such that γV (Vq) = Vγq for all q ∈Q.
A morphism f : (V, {Vq}, γV ) →(W, {Wq}, γW ) is a C-linear map f : V →W
such that f(Vq) ⊂Wq (for all q) and γW f = γV f.
One can deﬁne tensor
products, duals (and more generally all constructions of linear algebra) for the
objects in the category Gr1.
The above construction associates to a scalar equation L over K an object of this
category Gr1. We will do this now more generally. Let N be a diﬀerential module
over K of dimension n. Then one considers the tensor product UnivR

K ⊗

K N
and deﬁnes V (N) := ker(∂, UnivR

K ⊗

K N). This is a vector space of dimension
n over C, again seen as the covariant solution space for the diﬀerential module.
Letting V (N)q := ker(∂, Rq ⊗

K N), we then again have V (N) = ⊕V (N)q.
The action of γ on UnivR

K induces an action γN on V (N) and the formula
γNV (N)q = V (N)γq holds. This construction leads to the following statement:
Proposition 3.30 The category of the diﬀerential modules Diﬀ

K over K is
equivalent with the category Gr1.
The equivalence acts C-linearly on Hom’s
and commutes with all constructions of linear algebra, in particular with tensor
products.
Proof.
Let Trip denote the functor from the ﬁrst category to the second. It is
rather clear that Trip commutes with tensor products et cetera. The two things
that one has to prove are:
1. Every object (V, {Vq}, γV ) of Gr1 is isomorphic to Trip(N) for some dif-
ferential module over K.
2. The C-linear map Hom(N1, N2) →Hom(Trip(N1), Trip(N2)) is an iso-
morphism.

82
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
Proof of 1. On W := UnivR

K ⊗C V one considers the natural additive maps
∂, γ and σh for h ∈Hom(Q, C∗) deﬁned by the following formulas (where
r ∈UnivR

K and v ∈Vq) :
∂(r ⊗v) = r′ ⊗v,
γ(r ⊗v) = (γ(r)) ⊗(γV (v)) and
σh(r ⊗v) = (σh(r)) ⊗(h(q)v).
Let N be the set of elements of W which are invariant under γ and all σh.
Then N is clearly a vector space over K. The map ∂on UnivR

K commutes
with γ and all σh, and induces therefore a map ∂: N →N having the usual
properties. In order to prove that N is a diﬀerential module over K it suﬃces
to verify that its dimension is ﬁnite. Let q1, . . . , qr denote the elements such
that Vqi ̸= 0. Then the invariants of W under the group of all σh is equal to
W1 := ⊕r
i=1R0e(−qi) ⊗Vqi. Further N is the set on elements of W1 invariant
under γ. Let m ≥1 be minimal such that all qi ∈z−1/mC[z−1/m]. Consider
W γm
1
, the set of invariants of W1 under γm. It suﬃces to prove that this is a
ﬁnite dimensional vector space over Km. Each term R0e(−qi) ⊗Vqi is setwise
invariant under γm. Thus we may restrict our attention to only one such term.
Further we may suppose that the action of γm on Vqi has only one Jordan block,
say with eigenvalue λ and with length s. One observes that the γm-invariant
elements of R0e(−qi) ⊗Vqi lie in Km[l]szbe(−qi) ⊗Vqi, where b is chosen such
that e−2mπib = λ and where Km[l]s denotes the set of polynomials of degree
< s. This proves that the space of invariants has ﬁnite dimension over Km.
Thus N is a diﬀerential module over K.
The veriﬁcation that the natural map UnivR

K ⊗N →W = UnivR

K ⊗V is
a bijection is straightforward. It follows that Trip(N) is isomorphic to the given
object (V, {Vq}, γV ).
Proof of 2. One uses Hom(N1, N2) = Hom(1, N ∗
1 ⊗N2), where 1 denotes the
1-dimensional trivial module Ke with ∂e = 0 and where ∗stands for the dual.
Then 2. reduces to proving that the map ker(∂, N) →{v ∈V | v ∈V0, γV (v) =
v}, where (V, {Vq}, γV ) = Trip(N), is a bijection.
This easily follows from
{r ∈UnivR

K | r ∈R0, γ(r) = r} = K.

Remark 3.31 Consider a diﬀerential module N over
K with Trip(N) =
(V, {Vq}, γV ).
The space V := ker(∂, UnivR

K ⊗N) is invariant under any
element σh of the exponential torus T . The action of σh on V is explicitly given
by requiring that σh is multiplication by h(q) on the subspaces Vq of V . The
image of T in GL(V ) is called the exponential torus of N or of Trip(N). It is
actually an algebraic torus in GL(V ).
2
Corollary 3.32 Let the diﬀerential module N deﬁne the triple (V, {Vq}, γV )
in Gr1. Then the diﬀerential Galois group of N is, seen as an algebraic sub-
group of GL(V ), generated by the exponential torus and the formal monodromy.
Furthermore, N is regular singular if and only if exponential torus is trivial.

3.2. THE UNIVERSAL PICARD-VESSIOT RING OF K

Proof.
The Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld L ⊃K of N is the subﬁeld of UnivF

ated over K by all the coordinates of a basis of V ⊂UnivR


K N with respect
to a basis of N over K. The exponential torus and the formal monodromy are
seen as elements in GL(V ). At the same time, they act as diﬀerential automor-
phisms of L and belong therefore to the diﬀerential Galois group of N. We have
already proven that an element of UnivF

K, which is invariant under the expo-
nential torus and the formal monodromy belongs to K. The same holds then
for the subﬁeld L ⊂UnivF

K. By Picard-Vessiot theory, the diﬀerential Galois
group is the smallest algebraic subgroup of GL(V ) containing the exponential
torus and the formal monodromy.
If N is a regular singular module, then the exponential torus T acts trivially
on the solution space so the exponential torus of N is trivial. Conversely, if the
exponential torus of N is trivial then 0 is the only eigenvalue of M. Exercise 3.29
implies that N is regular singular.

Example 3.33 The Airy equation y′′ = zy.
This equation has a singular point at ∞. One could write everything in the local
variable t = 1
z at ∞. However we prefer to keep the variable z. The solution
space V at ∞has a direct sum decomposition V = Vz3/2 ⊕V−z3/2 in spaces of
dimension 1 (we shall show this in Section 3.3, Example 3.52.2). The formal
monodromy γ interchanges the two spaces Vz3/2 and V−z3/2. If v1 generates
Vz3/2, v2 = γ(v1) generates V−z3/2. Since the Galois group of the equation is
a subgroup of SL2(C), the matrix of γ with respect to {v1, v2} is

Remark 3.34 Irreducible diﬀerential modules over K.
Consider a diﬀerential module N over K and let (V, Vq, γV ) be the corresponding
triple. Then N is irreducible if and only if this triple is irreducible. It is not
diﬃcult to verify that the triple is irreducible if and only if the non zero Vq’s
have dimension 1 and form one orbit under the action of γV . To see this note
that a γV -orbit of Vq’s deﬁnes a subobject. Hence there is only one γV -orbit,
say of lenght m and consisting of q1, . . . , qm. Take a 1-dimensional subspace W
of Vq1, invariant under γm
V . Then W ⊕γV W ⊕· · ·⊕γm−1
V
W is again a subobject.
Hence, the dimension of Vq1 and the other Vqi is 1.
This translates into:
N is irreducible if and only if there exists an integer m ≥1 such that Km ⊗N
has a basis e1, . . . , em with the properties:
(i) ∂ei = Qiei for i = 1, . . . , m and all Qi ∈C[z−1/m].
(ii) {Q1, . . . , Qm} is one orbit under the action of γ on C[z−1/m].
From this explicit description of Km ⊗N one can obtain an explicit description
of N = ( Km ⊗N)γ, by computing the vector space of the γ-invariant elements.

84
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
Another way to make the module N explicit is to consider the map N →
Km⊗N
pr
→Kme1. The ﬁrst arrow is the map n →1⊗n and the second arrow is
the projection on the direct summand Kme1. The composite map N →Kme1 is
a non-zero morphism of diﬀerential modules over K. Since N is irreducible, this
morphism is an isomorphism. In other words, an irreducible diﬀerential module
of dimension m over K has the form Kme with ∂e = Qe, where Q ∈C[z−1/m]
has the property Km = K[Q].
Further, two elements Q1, Q2 ∈C[z−1/m],
algebraic of degree m over K deﬁne isomorphic irreducible diﬀerential modules
over K if and only if there is an integer i such that γi(Q1) −Q2 ∈1
mZ.
We illustrate the above with an example. Let N be irreducible of dimension
two over K. Then K2 ⊗N = K2e1 + K2e2 with, say, ∂e1 = (z−1/2 + z−1)e1 and
∂e2 = (−z−1/2+z−1)e2. A basis for ( K2⊗N)γ is f1 := e1+e2, f2 := z−1/2(e1−
e2). On this basis one can calculate the action of ∂, namely: ∂f1 = z−1f1 + f2
and ∂f2 = z−1f1 + (z−1 −1/2)f2. The other possibility is to identify N with
K2e1. Then f1 := e1, f2 := z−1/2e1 is a basis of N over K and one can calculate
that the action of ∂on this basis is given by the same formulas.
We note that the suﬃciency of the above irreducibility criterion also appears
in [153] where it is stated in terms of the slopes of N (see the next section for
this concept): N is irreducible if it has just one slope and that this is a rational
number with exact denominator equal to the dimension of N.
2
Exercise 3.35 An observation on automorphisms made by M. van Hoeij.
Let N be a diﬀerential module over K such that its group of automorphisms is
equal to C∗. Prove that N is irreducible. Hint: Consider the triple (V, {Vq}, γV )
associated to N. An automorphism of the triple is a bijective linear A : V →V
such that A(Vq) = Vq for all q and AγV = γV A. By assumption this implies that
A is a multiple of the identity. Prove ﬁrst that the set {q| Vq ̸= 0} is one orbit
under the action of γ. Then show that Vq ̸= 0 implies that Vq has dimension 1
and compare with Remark 3.34.
2
Exercise 3.36 Semi-simple diﬀerential modules over K.
We recall, see 2.37, that a diﬀerential module M is semi-simple (or completely
reducible) if every submodule of M is a direct summand. As before K = C((z)).
Let C denote the full subcategory of the category Diﬀ

K of all diﬀerential modules
over K, whose objects are the semi-simple diﬀerential modules. Prove that C
has the properties stated in Section 10.1. Show that the universal diﬀerential
ring for C is equal to C((z))[{za}a∈C, {e(q)}q∈Q]. (Note that l is missing in this
diﬀerential ring).
2
Remarks 3.37 Triples for diﬀerential modules over the ﬁeld k((z)).
(1) We consider ﬁrst the case of an algebraically closed ﬁeld k (of characteristic
0). As remarked before, the classiﬁcation of diﬀerential modules over k((z)) is
completely similar to the case C((z)). The universal diﬀerential ring for the ﬁeld

3.2. THE UNIVERSAL PICARD-VESSIOT RING OF K
85
k((z)) has also the same description, namely k((z))[{za}a∈k, l, {e(q)}q∈Q] with
Q = ∪m≥1z−1/mk[z−1/m]. For the deﬁnition of the diﬀerential automorphism
γ of this universal diﬀerential ring, one needs an isomorphism of groups, say,
exp : k/Z →k∗. For k = C, we have used the natural isomorphism exp(c) =
e2πic. In the general case an isomorphism exp exists. Indeed, the group k/Z is
isomorphic to Q/Z ⊕A where A is a vector space over Q of inﬁnite dimension.
The group k∗is isomorphic to Q/Z⊕B with B a vector space over Q of inﬁnite
dimension. The vector spaces A and B are isomorphic since the have the same
cardinality. However there is no natural candidate for exp. Nevertheless, this
suﬃces to deﬁne the diﬀerential automorphism γ as before by:
(i) γ(za) = exp(a)za for all a ∈k,
(ii) γ(e(q)) = e(γq) and
(iii) γ(l) = l + 1. (here 1 replaces the 2πi of the complex case).
With these changes, Proposition 3.30 and its proof remain valid.
(2) Consider now any ﬁeld k of characteristic 0 and let k denote its algebraic
closure. The classiﬁcation of diﬀerential modules M over k((z)) in terms of “tu-
ples” is rather involved. Let K denote the diﬀerential ﬁeld k⊗k k((z)) (compare
Exercise 3.21). For the diﬀerential ﬁeld K there is an obvious description of the
universal diﬀerential ring, namely again R := K[{za}a∈k, l, {e(q)}q∈Q] where
Q = ∪m≥1z−1/mk[z−1/m]. On this ring there is an obvious action of the Galois
group Gal(k/k). One associates to M the solution space V = ker(∂, R⊗k((z))M).
This solution space has a direct sum decomposition ⊕q∈QVq, an action of γ (de-
ﬁned in (1)), called γV and an action of the Galois group Gal(k/k), called ρV .
Thus we can associate to M the tuple (V, {Vq}, γV , ρV ). This tuple satisﬁes the
compatibilities of the triple (V, {Vq}, γV ) and moreover staisﬁes a compatibility
of ρV with respect to the {Vq}’s and γV . One can show, as in Proposition 3.30,
that the functor M →(V, {Vq}, γV , ρV ) is an equivalence between the (Tan-
nakian) categories of the diﬀerential modules over k((z)) and the one of tuples
described above. This description is probably too complicated to be useful.
2
Observations 3.38 Irreducible diﬀerential modules over k((z)).
The ﬁeld k has characteristic 0 and is not necessarily algebraically closed. We
present here the description of the irreducible diﬀerential modules over k((z)),
with diﬀerentiation δ = z d
dz, given by R. Sommeling [277].
The ideas and
methods are an extension of Remark 3.34.
We will ﬁrst describe the ﬁnite extensions of k((z)). Let K ⊃k((z)) be a
ﬁnite ﬁeld extension. The ﬁeld K is again complete w.r.t. a discrete valuation.
The diﬀerentiation of k((z)) extends uniquely to K. We will either write δ(a)
or a′ for the derivative of an element a ∈K. The minimal monic polynomial of
any constant c of K has coeﬃcients in k. Thus the ﬁeld of constants k′ of K is
the algebraic closure of k in K. Since one works in characteristic zero this is also
the unique coeﬃcient ﬁeld of K containing k. Thus K = k′((u)) for a suitable
element u. The element z is equal to some expression c−1um(1+c1u+c2u2+· · ·).
The number m ≥1 is called the ramiﬁcation index.
After replacing u by
t(1 + c1u + c2u2 + · · · )−1/m one ﬁnds K = k′((t)) and cz = tm with c ∈k′.

86
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
We note that δ(t) = 1
mt. Further t is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero
element in k′ and c is unique up to the nth power of this element in k′.
Consider the 1-dimensional diﬀerential module Ke given by ∂e = Qe. One
normalizes Q such that Q ∈k′[t−1] (this normalization does not depend on the
choice of t). The thesis of R. Sommeling contains the following results:
(1) Suppose that K = k((z))[Q], then Ke with ∂e = Qe, considered as a diﬀer-
ential module over k((z)), is irreducible.
(2) Two irreducible diﬀerential modules over k((z)), of the form considered in
(1) and given by Q1 and Q2, are isomorphic if and only if there exists an k((z))-
isomorphism σ : k((z))[Q1] →k((z))[Q2] with σ(Q1) −Q2 ∈
1
mZ, where m ≥1
is the ramiﬁcation index of k((z))[Q1].
(3) Every irreducible diﬀerential over k((z)) is isomorphic to a diﬀerential mod-
ule of the form considered in (1).
Proof.
(1) K is seen as a subﬁeld of a ﬁxed algebraic closure k((z)) of k((z)).
Put M = Ke and take any non-zero element v = fe ∈M.
Then ∂(v) =
( f ′
f + Q)v. Let L ∈k((z))[δ] denote the minimal monic operator with Lv = 0.
Then L, seen as operator in k((z))[δ] has right hand factor δ −( f ′
f + Q). For
every automorphism σ of k((z)) over k((z)), the operator δ −σ( f ′
f + Q) is
also a right hand divisor of L.
Let σ1, . . . , σn denote the set of the k((z))-
linear homomorphisms of K into k((z)). Then n = [K : k((z))] and since Q is
normalized, the operators δ −σi( f ′
f +Q), i = 1, . . . , n are pairwise inequivalent.
The least common left multiple L1 of these operators in k((z))[δ] is in fact a
monic operator in k((z))[δ], since it is invariant under the action of the Galois
group of k((z)) over k((z)). Clearly L is a left multiple of L1 and by minimality
one has L = L1 and L has degree n. This shows that the diﬀerential module M
over k((z)) has no proper submodules.
Further we note that the δ −σi( f ′
f + Q) are the only possible monic right hand
factors of degree one of L in k((z))[δ], since they are pairwise inequivalent.
(2) Suppose that σ(Q1) −Q2 ∈
1
mZ. Then K = k((z))[Q1] = k((z))[Q2]. Let
M = Ke with ∂e = Q1e, then for a suitable power f of t (i.e., the element
deﬁned in the above description of K) one has that ∂fe = Q2fe. Thus the two
diﬀerential modules over k((z)) are isomorphic.
On the other hand, suppose that the two diﬀerential modules M1 and M2
over k((z)), given by Q1 and Q2, are isomorphic. Then M1 and M2 contain non-
zero elements v1, v2 such that the minimal monic operators Li ∈k((z))[δ] with
Livi = 0 are equal. In (1) we have seen that these operators are least common
left multiple of conjugates of δ −( f ′
i
fi + Qi) for i = 1, 2. The unicity of these
sets of monic right hand factors of degree one in k((z))[δ], implies that there
exists a σ with σ( f ′
1
f1 + Q1) = f ′
2
f2 + Q2. It follows that k((z))[Q1] = k((z))[Q2].
Let m ≥1 denote the ramiﬁcation of the latter ﬁeld. Then f ′
i
fi is modulo the

3.2. THE UNIVERSAL PICARD-VESSIOT RING OF K
87
maximal ideal of the ring of integers of K equal to some element in
1
mZ. Thus
σ(Q1) −Q2 ∈1
mZ.
(3) Let M be an irreducible diﬀerential module over k((z)). One considers a ﬁeld
extension K ⊃k((z)), lying in k((z)), of minimal degree, such that K ⊗k((z)) M
contains a submodule Ke of dimension one. As above, one writes K = k′((t))
with tm = cz. Further, one normalizes e such that ∂e = Qe with Q ∈k′[t−1]. By
minimality, K = k((z))[Q]. Let σ1, . . . , σn denote the k((z))-linear embeddings
of K into k((z)). This leads to a diﬀerential submodule N := ⊕n
i=1k((z))σi(e)
of k((z)) ⊗k((z)) M, with an action of the Galois group G of k((z)) indicated
by the notation and ∂given by ∂σi(e) = σi(Q)σi(e). Since N is stable under
the action of G, one has that the space of invariants N G is a non-zero k((z))-
diﬀerential submodule of M. Since M is irreducible, one has that M = N G.
The latter translates into M is isomorphic as k((z))-diﬀerential module with
Ke with ∂e = Qe.
2
In R. Sommeling’s thesis the above results are extended to a description of
all semi-simple diﬀerential modules over k((z)) by means of certain equivalence
classes of monic polynomials over the ﬁeld k((z)).
2
Split and quasi-split equations over Kconv = C({z})
We now turn to equations with meromorphic coeﬃcients. We let Kconv be
the ﬁeld of convergent Laurent series in z and Kconv,m be the ﬁeld of convergent
Laurent series in z1/m.
Deﬁnition 3.39 A diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay over C({z}) will be called
split if it is the direct sum of equations y′ = (qi + Ci)y with qi ∈z−1C[z−1]
and Ci constant matrices. The equation is called quasi-split if it is split over
C({z1/m}) for some m ≥1.
2
We translate the notions in terms of diﬀerential modules. A diﬀerential module
M over the ﬁeld Kconv of convergent Laurent series is split if M is a direct
sum ⊕s
i=1E(qi) ⊗Ni, where q1, . . . , qs ∈z−1C[z−1], where E(q) denotes the
one-dimensional module Kconveq over Kconv with ∂eq = qeq and where the Ni
are regular singular diﬀerential modules over Kconv. The diﬀerential module
M over Kconv is called quasi-split if for some m ≥1 the diﬀerential module
Kconv, m ⊗M is split over Kconv, m.
One has that the Picard-Vessiot extension of C({z}) corresponding to a quasi-
split equation can be taken to lie in the subﬁeld of UnivF

K generated over
C({z}) by the elements l, {za}a∈C, {e(q)}q∈Q. The argument of Corollary 3.32
implies the following
Proposition 3.40 The diﬀerential Galois groups of a quasi-split diﬀerential
equation y′ = Ay over C({z}) and C((z)) are the same.
This group is the
smallest linear algebraic group containing the exponential torus and the formal
monodromy.

88
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
For equations that are not quasi-split, the Galois group over C({z}) will, in
general, be larger. We will give a complete description of the Galois group in
Chapter 8. The starting point in this description is the following:
Proposition 3.41 Every diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay with coeﬃcients in K
is, over the ﬁeld K, equivalent with a unique (up to isomorphism over Kconv)
quasi-split equation over Kconv. The translation of this statement in terms of
diﬀerential modules over K is:
For every diﬀerential module M over K, there is a unique N ⊂M, such that:
1. N is a quasi-split diﬀerential module over the ﬁeld Kconv.
2. The natural K-linear map K ⊗Kconv N →M is an isomorphism.
To prove this proposition, we need the following result that will allow us to
strengthen the results of Proposition 3.12.
Lemma 3.42 Let A ∈Mn(Kconv) and assume that the equation Y ′ = AY is
equivalent over K to an equation with constant coeﬃcients. Then Y ′ = AY is
equivalent over Kconv to an equation with constant coeﬃcients.
Proof.
By assumption, there is a matrix B ∈GLn( 
K) such that B−1AB −
B−1B′ is a constant matrix. By truncating B after a suitably high power, we
may assume that A is equivalent (over Kconv) to a matrix in Mn(C{z}), and so,
from the start assume that A ∈Mn(C{z}). Following the argument of Lemma
3.11, we may assume that A = A0 + A1z + · · · where the distinct eigenvalues
of A0 do not diﬀer by integers. As in Proposition 3.12, we wish to construct a
matrix P = I + P1z + · · · , Pi ∈Mn(C) such that the power series deﬁning P is
convergent in a neighbourhood of the origin and PA0 = AP −P ′. Comparing
powers of z, one sees that
A0Pi −Pi(A0 + iI) = −(Ai + Ai−1P1 + · · · + A1Pi−1) .
Proposition 3.12 implies that these equations have a unique solution. Let Ln+1
denote the linear map X →A0X −XA0 −(n+1)X. Using the norm ∥(ai,j) ∥=
max |ai,j|, one sees that ∥L−1
n+1 ∥= O( 1
n). Using this bound, one can show that
the series deﬁning P converges.
2
Proof of Proposition 3.41. We give a proof using diﬀerential modules and
return later to matrices. The ﬁrst case that we study is that of a diﬀerential
module M over K, which has only 0 as eigenvalue.
In other words, M is
regular singular over K. As we have seen before, M has a basis e1, . . . , em over
K such that the matrix C of ∂, with respect to this basis, has coeﬃcients in
C.
Using the argument before Lemma 3.11, we may even suppose that the
(distinct) eigenvalues λi, i = 1, . . . , r (with multiplicities k1, . . . , kr) of this

3.2. THE UNIVERSAL PICARD-VESSIOT RING OF K
89
constant matrix satisfy 0 ≤Re(λi) < 1. It is clear that N := Kconve1 + · · · +
Kconvem has the properties 1. and 2. We now want to prove that N is unique.
A small calculation shows that the set of solutions m ∈M of the equation
(δ −λi)kim = 0 is a C-linear subspace Wi of Ce1 + · · · + Cem.
Moreover
Ce1 +· · ·+Cem is the direct sum of the Wi. For a complex number µ such that
µ−λi ̸∈Z for all i, one calculates that the set of the m ∈M with (δ−µ)km = 0
(any k ≥1) is just 0. Consider now another ˜N ⊂M having the properties
1. and 2. Then ˜N is regular singular over Kconv and we know, from Lemma
3.42 that there is a basis f1, . . . , fm of ˜N over Kconv, such that the matrix
D of ∂, with respect to this basis, is constant and all its eigenvalues µ satisfy
0 ≤Re(µ) < 1. From the calculation above it follows that the eigenvalues of
D are also eigenvalues for C (and also the converse). We conclude now that
Cf1 + · · · + Cfm = Ce1 + · · · + Cem. In particular, N = ˜N.
The next case that we consider is a diﬀerential module M over K, such that
all its eigenvalues belong to z−1C[z−1]. Again we want to show the existence
and the uniqueness of a N ⊂M with properties 1. and 2., such that N is
split. M decomposes (uniquely) over K as a direct sum of modules having only
one eigenvalue. It is easily seen that it suﬃces to prove the proposition for
the case of only one eigenvalue q. One considers the one dimensional module
F(q) := K ⊗Kconv E(q).
Thus F(q) = Keq and ∂eq = qeq.
The module
F(−q) ⊗

K M has again only one eigenvalue and this eigenvalue is 0. This is the
regular singular case that we have treated above.
Finally, we take a general diﬀerential module M over K. Take m ≥1 such that
all its eigenvalues belong to Km = K[z1/m]. Then the module Km ⊗M has
a unique subset ˜
N, which is a split diﬀerential module over Kconv, m and such
that the natural map Km ⊗Kconv, m ˜N →Km ⊗

K M is an isomorphism. Let σ
be a generator of the Galois group of Km over K. Then σ acts on Km ⊗M by
the formula σ(f ⊗m) = σ(f) ⊗m. Clearly σ( ˜
N) has the same property as ˜N.
The uniqueness implies that σ( ˜N) = ˜N. Thus σ acts on ˜N. This action is semi-
linear, i.e., σ(f ˜n) = σ(f)σ(˜n). Let N denote the set of the σ-invariant elements
of ˜N. Then it is easily seen that the natural maps Kconv, m ⊗Kconv N →˜N and
K ⊗Kconv N →M are isomorphisms. Thus we have found an N with properties
1. and 2. The uniqueness of N follows from its construction.
We return now to the matrix formulation of the proposition. For a matrix equa-
tion y′ = Ay over K (with module M over K), such that the eigenvalues are in
z−1C[z−1], it is clear that the module N over Kconv has a matrix representation
y′ = By which is a direct sum of equations y′ = (qi + Ci)y with qi ∈z−1C[z−1]
and constant matrices Ci. In the case that y′ = Ay has eigenvalues which are
not in z−1C[z−1], one can again take a basis of the module N and consider the
matrix equation y′ = By obtained in this way.
2
Remarks 3.43 1. It is more diﬃcult to give this matrix B, deﬁned in the ﬁnal
paragraph of the above proof, explicitly. This problem is somewhat analogous

90
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
to the formulation of the real Jordan decomposition of real matrices. We will
give an example. Consider a two dimensional equation y′ = Ay with eigenvalues
q1, q2 which are not in z−1C[z−1]. Then the eigenvalues are in z−1/2C[z−1/2]
and they are conjugate. The module ˜N over Kconv, 2, of the proof of the propo-
sition, has a basis e1, e2 such that ∂ei = qiei. Let σ be a generator of the Galois
group of K2 over K. Then one easily sees that σe1 = e2 and σe2 = e1. The
elements f1 = e1 +e2 and f2 = z−1/2(e1 −e2) form a basis of N over Kconv and
the matrix of ∂with respect to this basis is equal to

λ
z−1µ
µ
λ −1/2

, where
q1 = λ + z−1/2µ, q2 = λ −z−1/2µ, λ, µ ∈z−1C[z−1].
The issue of ﬁnding B explicitly is also addressed in [178] where a version of
Proposition 3.41 is also proven. Proposition 3.41 also appears in [17].
2. For the study of the asymptotic theory of diﬀerential equations, we will use
Proposition 3.41 as follows. Let a matrix diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay over
Kconv be given. Then there exists a quasi-split equation y′ = By over Kconv
and an F ∈GLn(C((z))) such that F −1A F −F −1 F ′ = B.
The equation
y′ = By is unique up to equivalence over Kconv. For a ﬁxed choice of B the
formal transformation F is almost unique.
Any other choice for the formal
transformation has the form FC with C ∈GLn(C) such that C−1BC = B.
The asymptotic theory is concerned with lifting F to an invertible meromorphic
matrix F on certain sectors at z = 0, such that F −1AF −F −1F ′ = B holds.
The above matrix C is irrelevant for the asymptotic liftings F.

Newton Polygons
In this section we present another approach to the classiﬁcation of diﬀerential
modules over a ﬁeld which is complete w.r.t. a discrete valuation. Let k denote a
ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and let D := k((z))[δ] denote the skew ring of diﬀerential
operators over k((z)), where δ := z∂z. Note that δz = zδ + z. For a ﬁnite ﬁeld
extension K ⊃k((z)) we also have the skew ring K[δ]. For every f ∈K one
has δf −fδ = f ′, where f →f ′ is the unique extension of z d
dz to K.

is a convex subset of R2 which contains useful combinatorial information of L.
The slopes k1 < · · · < kr of the line segments forming the boundary of the
Newton polygon are important in many discussions concerning L and will be
crucial when we discuss the notion of multisummation. In this section we will
use Newton polygons for the formal decomposition of L, following the work of

3.3. NEWTON POLYGONS
91
B. Malgrange [188] and J-P. Ramis [235].
We begin by recalling some facts
concerning polyhedral subsets of R2, [97].
A subset of R2 that is the intersection of a ﬁnite number of closed half-planes is
said to be a polyhedral set. We will only consider connected polyhedral sets with
nonempty interior. The boundary of such a set is the union of a ﬁnite number of
(possibly inﬁnite) closed line segments called edges. The endpoints of the edges
are called vertices or extremal points. The vertices and edges of such a set are
collectively referred to as the faces of the set. Given two subsets N and M of
R2 we deﬁne the (Minkowski) sum of these sets to be M + N = {m + n | m ∈
M, n ∈N}. Any face of the sum of two polyhedral sets M and N is the sum of
faces of M and N respectively. In particular, any vertex of M + N is the sum
of vertices of M and N.
On R2 one deﬁnes a partial order, namely (x1, y1) ≥(x2, y2) is deﬁned as
y1 ≥y2 and x1 ≤x2. We now can make the following
Deﬁnition 3.44 The elements of D = k((z))[δ] of the form zmδn will be called
monomials. The Newton polygon N(L) of L ̸= 0 is the convex hull of the set
{(x, y) ∈R2| there is a monomial zmδn in L with (x, y) ≥(n, m)}.
2
N(L) has ﬁnitely many extremal points {(n1, m1), . . . , (nr+1, mr+1)} with
0 ≤n1 < n2 < · · · < nr+1 = n. The positive slopes of L are k1 < · · · < kr with
ki = mi+1−mi
ni+1−ni . It is also useful to introduce the notation kr+1 = ∞. If n1 > 0
then one adds a slope k0 = 0 and in this case we put n0 = 0. The interesting
part of the boundary of N(L) is the graph of the function f : [0, n] →R, given
by
1. f(n0) = f(n1) = m1.
2. f(ni) = mi for all i.
3. f is (aﬃne) linear on each segment [ni, ni+1].
The slopes are the slopes of this graph. The length of the slope ki is ni+1 −ni.
We reserve the term special polygon for a convex set which is the Newton polygon
of some diﬀerential operator.
Let b(L) or b(N(L)) denote the graph of f. The boundary part B(L) of L is
deﬁned as B(L) = 
(n,m)∈b(L) an,mzmδn. Write L = B(L) + R(L). We say
that L1 > L2 if the points of b(L1) either lie in the interior of N(L2) or on
the vertical ray {(nr+1, y) | y > mr+1}. Clearly R(L) > B(L) and R(L) > L.
We note that the product of two monomials M1 := zm1δn1, M2 := zm2δn2
is not a monomial.
In fact the product is zm1+m2(δ + m2)n1δn2.
However
B(M1M2) = zm1+m2δn1+n2. This is essential for the following result.

CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
Lemma 3.45
1. N(L1L2) = N(L1) + N(L2).
2. The set of slopes of L1L2 is the union of the sets of slopes of L1 and L2.
3. The length of a slope of L1L2 is the sum of the lengths of the same slope
for L1 and L2.
Proof.
1. Write L1 =  ai,jzjδi and L2 =  bi,jzjδi.
From the above it
follows that L1L2 = L3 + R with
L3 :=

(i1,j1)∈b(L1),(i2,j2)∈b(L2)
ai1,j1bi2,j2zj1+j2δi1+i2
and one has R > L3. This shows at once that N(L1L2) ⊂N(L1) + N(L2).
The boundary part of L3 can be written as

(s1,s2)∈b(L1L2)
(

an1,m1bn2,m2)zs2δs1
where the second sum is taken over all (n1, m1) ∈b(L1), (n2, m2) ∈b(L2) with
(n1, m1) + (n2, m2) = (s1, s2).
By making a drawing one easily veriﬁes the
following statement:
Suppose that v is a vertex of N(L1) + N(L2) and v = v1 + v2 with vi ∈
N(Li), i = 1, 2. Then vi is a vertex of N(Li) for i = 1, 2. Moreover v determines
v1 and v2.
From this statement we see that for a vertex v = (s1, s2) of N(L1) + N(L2)
the coeﬃcient of zs1δs2 in L3 does not vanish. Therefore N(L1) + N(L2) ⊂
N(L1L2). This proves the ﬁrst part of the lemma.
The two other parts follow easily from the above facts concerning the faces of
N(L1) + N(L2).

Example 3.46 The operator L = zδ2 + δ −1 factors as L = L1L2 where
L1 = δ −1 and L2 = zδ + 1.
Figure 3.1 show the corresponding Newton
polygons.

Exercises 3.47 Newton polygons and regular singular points
1. Show that 0 is a regular singular point of an operator L if and only if the
corresponding Newton polygon has only one slope and this slope is 0.
2. Show that if 0 is a regular singular point of an operator L, then it is a regular
singular point of any factor of L.
2
The next statement is a sort of converse of the lemma.
Theorem 3.48 Suppose that the Newton polygon of a monic diﬀerential oper-
ator L can be written as a sum of two special polygons P1, P2 that have no slope

in common. Then there are unique monic diﬀerential operators L1, L2 such that
Pi is the Newton polygon of Li and L = L1L2. Moreover
D/DL ∼= D/DL1 ⊕D/DL2.
Proof.
For the Newton polygon N(L) of L we use the notations above. We
start by proving three special cases.
(1) Suppose that n1 > 0 and that P1 has only one slope and that this slope
is 0. In particular, this implies that P2 has no slope equal to zero. We would
then like to ﬁnd the factorization L = L1L2. Every element M ∈D = k((z))[δ]
is given an expansion M = 
i>>−∞ziM(i)(δ) where the M(i)(δ) ∈k[δ] are
polynomials of bounded degree. Let L = 
k≥m zkL(k). The L1 = 
i≥0 ziL1(i)
that we want to ﬁnd satisﬁes: L1(0) is monic of degree n1 and the L1(i) have
degree < n1 for i ̸= 0. Furthermore, if we write L2 = 
i≥m ziL2(i), we will
have that L2(m) is constant since P2 has no slope equal to zero. The equality
L1L2 = L and the formula z−jL1(i)(δ)zj = L1(i)(δ + j) induces the following
formula:

k≥m
zk

i+j=k,i≥0,j≥m
L1(i)(δ + j)L2(j)(δ) =

k≥m
zkL(k)(δ)
From L1(0)(δ + m)L2(m)(δ) = L(m)(δ) and L1(0) monic and L2(m) constant,
one ﬁnds L1(0) and L2(m). For k = m + 1 one ﬁnds an equality
L1(0)(δ + m + 1)L2(m + 1)(δ) + L1(1)(δ + m)L2(m)(δ) = L(m + 1)(δ)
This equality is in fact the division of L(m + 1)(δ) by L1(0)(δ + m + 1) with
remainder L1(1)(δ+m)L2(m)(δ) of degree less than n1 = the degree of L1(0)(δ+
m + 1). Hence L1(1) and L2(m + 1) are uniquely determined. Every new value
of k determines two new terms L1(. . .) and L2(. . .). This proves the existence
and uniqueness in this special case.
(2) Suppose now that n1 = 0 and that P1 has only one slope s which is the
minimal slope of L. Write s = b
a with a, b ∈Z; a, b > 0 and g.c.d.(a, b) = 1.

94
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
We allow ourselves the ﬁeld extension k((z)) ⊂k((t)) with ta = z.
Write
∆= tbδ. After multiplying L with a power of t we may suppose that L ∈
k((t))[∆] is monic. Note that the Newton polygon of L now has minimal slope
0 and that this slope has length n2.
Every M ∈k((t))[∆] can be written
as M = 
i>>−∞tiM(i) where the M(i) ∈k[∆] are polynomials of bounded
degree. We want to ﬁnd L1, L2 ∈k((t))[∆] with L1L2 = L;
L1(0) is monic
of degree n2 −n1 = n2;
L1(i) has degree less than n2 for i > 0. Using that
∆t = t∆+ 1
atb+1, one ﬁnds for every index k an equation of the form

i+j=k
L1(i)L2(j) + “lower terms” = L(k)
Here “lower terms” means terms coming from a product L1(i)L2(j) with i+j <
k. The form of the exhibited formula uses strongly the fact that b > 0. It
is clear now that there is a unique solution for the decomposition L = L1L2.
We then normalize L, L1, L2 again to be monic elements of k((t))[δ]. Consider
the automorphism τ of k((t))[δ] which is the identity on k((z))[δ] and satisﬁes
τ(t) = ζt where ζ is a primitive ath root of unity. Since the decomposition is
unique, one ﬁnds τLi = Li for i = 1, 2. This implies that the Li are in k((z))[δ].
This ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem in this special case.
(3) The bijective map φ : k((z))[δ] →k((z))[δ], given by φ( aiδi) = (−δ)iai
is an anti-isomorphism, i.e. φ is k((z))-linear and φ(L1L2) = φ(L2)φ(L1). Using
this φ and (1),(2) one ﬁnds another new case of the theorem, namely: Suppose
that N(L) = P1 + P2 where P2 has only one slope and this slope is the minimal
slope (≥0) of L. Then there is a unique decomposition L = L1L2 with the
properties stated in theorem.
(4) Existence in the general case. The smallest slope s ≥0 of L belongs either
to P1 or P2. Suppose that it belongs to P1 (the other case is similar). According
to (1) and (2) we can write L = AB with A, B monic and such that A has only
s as slope and B does not have s as slope. By induction on the degree we may
suppose that B has a decomposition B = B1B2 with N(B2) = P2 and B1, B2
monic. Then L1 := AB1 and L2 := B2 is the required decomposition of L.
(5) The unicity. Suppose that we ﬁnd two decompositions L = L1L2 = ˜L1 ˜L2
satisfying the properties of the theorem. Suppose that the smallest slope s ≥0
of L occurs in P1. Write L1 = AB and ˜L1 = ˜A ˜B where A and ˜A have as
unique slope the minimal slope of L and where B, ˜B have no slope s. Then
L = ABL2 = ˜A ˜B ˜L2 and the unicity proved in (1) and (2) implies that A = ˜A
and BL2 = ˜B ˜L2. Induction on the degree implies that B = ˜B and L2 = ˜L2.
This ﬁnishes the proof of the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
(6) There is an exact sequence of k((z))[δ]-modules
0 →D/DL1
.L2
→D/DL
π1
→D/DL2 →0

3.3. NEWTON POLYGONS
95
corresponding to the decomposition L = L1L2. It suﬃces to show that π1 splits.
There is also a decomposition L = ˜L2 ˜L1 with N(˜Li) = Pi. This gives another
exact sequence
0 →D/D˜L2
.˜L1
→D/DL
π2
→D/D˜L1 →0
It suﬃces to show that
ψ : D/D˜L2
.˜L1
→D/DL
π1
→D/DL2
is an isomorphism. Since the two spaces have the same dimension, it suﬃces to
show that ψ is injective. Let A ∈D have degree less than d = the degree of
L2 and ˜L2. Suppose that A˜L1 lies in DL2. So A˜L1 = BL2. We note that ˜L1
and L2 have no slopes in common. This means that N(A) must contain N(L2).
This implies that the degree of A is at least d. This contradicts our hypothesis.
2
Examples 3.49 1. We consider the operator L(y) = zδ2 + δ + 1 of Example
3.46. One sees from Figure 3.1 that the Newton polygon of this operator is
the sum of two special polygons P1, having a unique slope 0, and P2, having a
unique slope 1. Using the notation of part (1) of the proof Theorem 3.48, we
have that n1 = 1 and m = 0. We let
L1
=
L1(0) + zL1(1) + · · ·
L2
=
L2(0) + zL2(1) + · · ·
where L1(0) is monic of degree 1, the L1(i) have degree 0 for i > 0 and L2(0) = 1.
Comparing the coeﬃcients of z0 in L = L1L2 we have that
L1(0)L2(0) = L1(0) = δ −1 .
Comparing coeﬃcients of z1 we have that
L1(0)(δ + 1)L2(1)(δ) + L1(1)(δ)L2(0)(δ) = δL2(1)(δ) + L1(1) = δ2 .
This implies that L2(1) = δ and L1(1) = 0. One can show by induction that
L1(i) = L2(i) = 0 for i ≥2. This yields the factorization given in Example 3.46.
2. We consider the operator
L = δ2 + ( 1
z2 + 1
z )δ + 1
z3 −2
z2 .
The Newton polygon of this operator can be written as the sum of two special
polygons P1 and P2 (see Figure 3.2).
The polygon P1 has minimal slope 1 so, using the notation of part (2) of the
proof Theorem 3.48, we have that a = b = 1 and t = z. Letting ∆= zδ we have
that
L = 1
z ∆2 + ( 1
z3 + 1
z2 −1
z )∆+ 1
z3 −2
z .

Figure 3.3: Newton Polygon for ˜L
We write ˜L = L1L2 where
L1
=
L1(0) + zL1(1) + z2L1(2) + · · ·
L2
=
z−1L2(−1) + L2(0) + zL2(1) + · · ·
where L1(0) has degree 1 (i.e., L1(0) = r∆+ s), L1(i) is constant for i > 0 and
L1(−1) = 1. Composing and equating coeﬃcients of powers of z we get
r∆+ s
=
∆+ 1
coeﬃcients of z−1
−r + (∆+ 1)L2(0) + L1(1)

∆2 + ∆−2
coeﬃcients of z0
(∆+ 1)L2(1) + L1(1)L2(0) + L1(2)
=
−∆
coeﬃcients of z1
These imply that r = s = 1, L2(0) = ∆, L1(1) = −1 and L2(1) = L1(2) = 0.
One can show by induction that L2(i) = L2(i + 1) = 0 for i > 1. This gives a

factorization ˜L = (∆+ 1 −z)(∆+ z−1). We therefore have that L =

z−2(zδ + 1 −z)(zδ + z−1)
=
z−2(zδ + 1 −z)z(δ + z−2)
=
z−2(z2δ + z)(δ + z−2)
=
(δ + z−1)(δ + z−2)
This gives a factorization of L.

Theorem 3.48 allows us to factor linear operators whose Newton polygons
have at least two slopes. We now turn to operators with only one positive slope
s.
Write as before s =
b
a with g.c.d(a, b) = 1 and a, b ∈Z; a, b > 0.
We
make the ﬁeld extension k((t)) ⊃k((z)) with ta = z and we write ∆= tbδ.
After normalization we may assume that L is monic with respect to ∆. Write
L = 
i≥0 tiL(i)(∆) where the L(i) are polynomials in ∆such that L(0) is
monic of degree n and the L(i) have degree less than n for i ̸= 0. The following
result is a restatement of Hensel’s Lemma for irregular diﬀerential operators.
Proposition 3.50 Suppose (using the above notation) that L ∈k[[t]][∆] is
monic of degree n. Suppose that L(0) ∈k[∆] factors into relative prime monic
polynomials L(0) = PQ. Then there is a unique factorization L = AB with
A, B monic and A(0) = P, B(0) = Q. Moreover
k((t))[δ]/k((t))[δ]L ∼= k((t))[δ]/k((t))[δ]A ⊕k((t))[δ]/k((t))[δ]B .
Proof.
Write A = 
i≥0 tiA(i); B = 
j≥0 tjB(j). Then
AB =

m≥0
tm(

i+j=m
A(i)B(j) + “lower terms” ) =

m≥0
tmL(m)
Again “lower terms” means some expression involving A(i) and B(j) with i+j <
m. Clearly one can solve this set of equations, using that A(0) and B(0) are
relatively prime, step by step in a unique way. This proves the ﬁrst part of the
proposition. The second part is proved as in Theorem 3.48.
2
Remark 3.51 The hypothesis that s > 0 is crucial in Proposition 3.50.
If
s = 0, then the point zero is a regular singular point and the exhibited equation
in the proof of Proposition 3.50 becomes AB =

m≥0
zm(

i+j=m
A(i)(δ + j)B(j)(δ) +
“lower terms” ) =

CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
In order to proceed, one needs to assume that A(0)(∆+ j) and B(0)(∆) are
relatively prime for j = 0, 1, 2, . . .. With this assumption, one can state a result
similar to the Hensel Lemma for regular singular points given in the previous
section.

Figure 3.4: Newton Polygon for Example 3.52.1
Using the above notation, we have that t2 = z and ∆= tδ. Rewriting ˜L in
terms of t and ∆, we have ˜L = 1
t2 L where
L

L(0) + tL(1) + t2L(2)

(∆2 −1

Since ∆2 −1
4 = (∆+ 1
2)(∆−1
2) we can apply Proposition 3.50. Let L1 =
∆+ 1
4 + tL1(1) + t2L1(2) + · · · and L2 = ∆−1
4 + tL2(1) + t2L2(2) + · · · .
Comparing the powers of t in L = L1L2, the coeﬃcients of t0 and t2 are resp.
L1(1)(∆−1

Therefore L1(1) = L2(1) = −1 and L1(2) = L2(2) = 0. One sees that this

2. We consider the Airy equation y′′ −zy = 0 mentioned in Example 3.33. We
wish to consider the behavior at inﬁnity so we make the change of variable t = 1
z
and write the resulting equation in terms of δ = t d
dt. This yields the equation
˜L = δ2 −δ −1
t3
which has Newton polygon given in Figure 3.5.

Figure 3.5: Newton Polygons for Example 3.52.2
The unique slope is 3
2 so we let τ = t1/2 and ∆= τ3δ. Rewriting ˜L in terms
of τ and ∆we have that L = τ−6∆2 −1
2τ −3∆−τ −6. Dividing by τ −6 yields
the equation
L = ∆2 −1
2τ 3∆−1
Since L(0) = ∆2 −1 we may write L = L1L2 where L1 = (∆−1)+τL1(1)+· · ·
and L2 = (∆+ 1) + τL2(1) + · · · . Composing these operators and comparing
coeﬃcients of powers of τ shows that L1(1) = L1(2) = L2(1) = L2(2) = 0.
Therefore
˜L
=
τ−6(∆−1 + τ 3(. . .))(∆+ 1 + τ3(. . .))
=
(δ −τ−3 + · · · )(δ + τ −3 + nonnegative powers of τ )
The form of the last factor shows that the Airy equation has a solution in Rz3/2.
Reversing the roles of ∆+ 1 and ∆−1 shows that it also has a solution in
R−z3/2. This veriﬁes the claim made in Exercise 3.33.
2
In order to factor a general L as far as possible, one uses the algebraic closure
k of k and fractional powers of z. Suppose that L has only one slope and that
this slope is positive. If Proposition 3.50 does not give a factorization then L(0)
must have the form (∆+ c)n for some c ∈k
∗(note that c ̸= 0 since L(0) must
have at least two terms). This implies that the original Newton polygon must
have a point of the form (1, m) on its boundary, that is on the line bx −ay = 0.
Therefore, a = 1 and ∆= zbδ in this case. One makes a change of variables
δ →δ +cz−b. One then sees that the Newton polygon N ′ of the new equation is

100
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
contained in the Newton polygon N of the old equation. The bottom edge of N ′
contains just one point of N and this is the point (n, bn) which must be a vertex
of N ′. Therefore, the slopes of N ′ are strictly less than b. If no factorization,
due to Theorem 3.48 or Proposition 3.50 occurs then L has again only one slope
and this slope is an integer b′ with 0 ≤b′ < b. For b′ = 0 one stops the process.
For b′ > 0 one repeats the method above. The factorization of L stops if each
factor ˜L satisﬁes:
There is an element q ∈t−1k′[t−1], where k′ is a ﬁnite extension
of k and tm = z for some m ≥1, such that ˜L has only slope zero
with respect to δ −q. This can be restated as ˜L ∈k′[[t]][(δ −q)] and
˜L is monic in (δ −q).

L = δ2 + 4 + 2z −z2 −3z3

L = (δ′′)2 −(3z + 1)δ′′ + 2z2 .

We continue the discussions in Remarks 3.37 and Observations 3.38, con-

ﬁelds than C((z)). Let, as before, k be any ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and let k((z))
be the diﬀerential ﬁeld with derivation δ = z d
dz. A ﬁnite ﬁeld extension K of
k((z)) is again presented as K = k′((t)) with k ⊂k′ and t with tm = cz for
some non-zero c ∈k′.
As in the case k((z)), a monic operator L ∈K[δ], is called regular singular if we
have L ∈k′[[t]][δ]. The Deﬁnition 3.9 of a regular singular diﬀerential module
is in an obvious way extended to the case of the more general ﬁeld K. One can
show that this notion is equivalent to: M ∼= K[δ]/K[δ]L for a regular singular L.
As in Proposition 3.12, one shows that for a regular singular diﬀerential module
M over K there exists a basis {e1, . . . , en} of M over K such that the matrix
of δ with respect to {e1, . . . , en} is constant. In other words, the corresponding
matrix equation is δy = Ay with A a matrix with coeﬃcients in k′. It is not easy
to decide when two equations δy = Aiy, i = 1, 2 with coeﬃcients in k′ are equiv-
alent over K. In the case K = k((t)) with k algebraically closed and tm = z,
one chooses a set S ⊂k of representatives of k/( 1
mZ). Any matrix equation
with constant coeﬃcients, can be normalized into an equation δy = Ay where
the eigenvalues of the constant matrix A are in S. Two “normalized” equations
δy = Aiy, i = 1, 2 are equivalent over K = k((t)) if and only if A2 is a conjugate
of A1.
For the ﬁeld K = C((t)) with tm = z, one associates to a matrix equation
with constant coeﬃcients δy = Ay the matrix e2mπiA.
This matrix (or its
conjugacy class) is called the topological monodromy of the equation (w.r.t. the
ﬁeld K). Using Proposition 3.30, one can show that two equations δy = Aiy
with constant matrices Ai are isomorphic if and only if e2mπiA1 is a conjugate
of e2mπiA2 (see also Theorem 5.1).
For q ∈t−1k′[t−1] we write E(q) for the k′((t))[δ]-module generated over k′((t))
by one element v such that δv = qv. Let M be a regular singular module with
cyclic vector e and minimal monic equation Le = 0 where L =  aiδi. Then
M ⊗E(q) has the cyclic vector e ⊗v.
The minimal monic equation for this cyclic vector is  ai(δ −q)i.
Fur-
thermore, for any operator of the form L =  aiδi, the k′((t))[δ]-module

102
CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY
k′((t))[δ]/k′((t))[δ]L is of the form M ⊗E(q). In particular, this is true for
each ˜L described in the exhibited paragraph preceding Exercise 3.53. We can
now state
Theorem 3.54 Let L ∈k((z))[δ] be a monic diﬀerential operator. There exist
a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension k′ of k, an integer m ≥1, elements q1, . . . , qs ∈t−1k′[t−1]
with tm = cz (some non-zero c ∈k′) and L1, . . . , Ls ∈k′((t))[δ] such that:
1. If i ̸= j then qi ̸= qj.
2. Li ∈k′[[t]][δ −qi] and is monic in δ −qi.
3. L = L1 · · · Ls.
Moreover one has that
k′((t))[δ]/k′((t))[δ]L ∼= ⊕Mi ⊗E(qi)
where the Mi are regular singular k′((t))[δ]-modules.
Proof.
The above methods allow one to factor L and give a factorization
L = R1 · · · Ra that yields a direct sum decomposition k′((t))[δ]/k′((t))[δ]L =
⊕k′((t))[δ]/k′((t))[δ]Ri. According to the above discussion, each factor has the
form Nq ⊗E(q) with Nq regular singular. The q’s need not be distinct. Let
{q1, . . . , qs} denote the distinct q’s occurring. Put Mi = ⊕q=qiNq. This proves
the second part of the theorem.
To prove the ﬁrst part of the theorem, we let e be a cyclic vector of
k′((t))[δ]/k′((t))[δ]L annihilated by L and let e = e1 + · · · + es with each
ei ∈Mi ⊗E(qi). One sees that each ei is a cyclic vector of Mi ⊗E(qi) and
that L(ei) = 0. If Ls is the minimal monic annihilator of es, then Ls must
divide L on the right. Furthermore, since (Mi ⊗E(qi)) ⊗E(−qs) is regular,
Proposition 3.16 implies that Ls(δ + qi) is a regular operator and so is in k′[[t]].
Therefore Ls ∈k[[t]][δ −qs]. An induction on s ﬁnishes the proof of the ﬁrst
part of the theorem.
2
Remarks 3.55 1. We have seen in Proposition 3.41 that the module M =
D/DL determines uniquely the direct sum decomposition Theorem 3.54 part
(2). In particular the qi and the dimensions di of the Mi (as vector spaces over
k′((t)) ) are determined by M. From this information one can reconstruct the
Newton polygon of L.
Indeed, Li has one slope, namely −v(qi) with length di = the order of Li. Since
N(L) = N(L1) + · · · + N(Ls) one ﬁnds the following:
λ is a slope of N(L) if and only if λ = −v(qi) for some i. Moreover
the length of the slope λ is equal to 
λ=−v(qi) di.

3.3. NEWTON POLYGONS
103
In particular, the Newton polygon of M does not depend on the choice of a
cyclic vector.
2. We also note that the methods described in this section yield an algorithm
to calculate the qi of Proposition 3.41. Moreover, these methods produce a set
of at most n such qi. More eﬃcient algorithms are presented in the works of
Barkatou et al. [19, 20, 21, 23, 24], Chen [66], Della Dora et al. [83], Hilali et
al. [128, 129, 130, 131] van Hoeij [138], Pﬂ¨ugel [219, 220] and Tournier [280].
2
We end the chapter by noting that the formal classiﬁcation of general linear
diﬀerential equations has a long history going back to the nineteenth century
with the works of Fuchs [103, 104] (see also [112, 113]) and Fabry [99], who
wrote down a fundamental set of local solutions of regular singular equations
and general linear equations, respectively. In the early twentieth century, Cope
[72, 73] also considered these issues. Besides the works of Deligne, Katz, Mal-
grange [186, 189] , Ramis and Turrittin (already mentioned), this problem has
been considered by Babbitt and Varadarajan [12], Balser et al. [17], Levelt [171],
Robba [247] and Wasow [300] (who attribute the result to Turrittin). The pa-
pers of Babitt-Varadarajan and Varadarajan [13, 297, 296] give a more detailed
exposition of the recent history of the problem.

CHAPTER 3. FORMAL LOCAL THEORY

Chapter 4
Algorithmic Considerations
Linear diﬀerential equations over the diﬀerential ﬁeld C((z)) (with C an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0, in particular C = C) were classiﬁed in
Chapter 3. When the standard form of such a diﬀerential equation is known,
then its Picard-Vessiot ring, its diﬀerential Galois group, the formal solutions
etc.
are known. The methods of Chapter 3 have been transformed into al-
gorithms and are implemented.
In this chapter we consider “global” linear
diﬀerential equations, i.e., equations over the diﬀerential ﬁeld C(z). Here C is a
ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and the diﬀerentiation on C(z) is the usual one, namely
f →f ′ = df
dz. We furthermore assume that there are algorithms to perform the
ﬁeld operations in C as well as algorithms to factor polynomials over C(z) (see
[102], [233] for a formalization of this concept). Natural choices for C are Q,
any number ﬁeld or the algebraic closure of Q.
It is no longer possible to transform any linear diﬀerential equation over C(z)
into some standard equation from which one can read oﬀits Picard-Vessiot ring,
its diﬀerential Galois group etc. Instead we will present algorithmic methods to
ﬁnd global solutions which are rational, exponential or Liouvillian. Factoring
linear diﬀerential operators over C(z) is in fact the main theme of this chap-
ter. One has to distinguish between “theoretical” algorithms and eﬃcient ones.
Especially the latter category is progressing quickly and we will only indicate
some of its features. We observe that the language of diﬀerential operators and
the one of diﬀerential modules (or matrix diﬀerential equations) have both their
advantages and disadvantages. In this Chapter we choose between the two for
the purpose of simplifying the exposition.
The last part of this Chapter is concerned with the inverse problem for ﬁnite
groups. An eﬀective algorithm is explained which produces for a representation
of a ﬁnite group a corresponding diﬀerential equation.

CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
4.1
Rational and Exponential Solutions
Rational Solutions
Let
L
=
∂n + an−1∂n−1 + · · · + a0
(4.1)
be a linear diﬀerential operator with coeﬃcients in C(z) and ∂=
d
dz.
The
problem of ﬁnding the solutions y ∈C(z) of L(y) = 0 has a simpler analogue
namely, ﬁnding solutions a ∈Q of p(z) = anzn + · · · + a0 = 0, p(z) ∈Z[z]. If a
is written as u
v with u, v ∈Z and (u, v) = 1, then u divides a0 and v divides an.
This obviously solves this problem. Consider a nonzero solution y = u
v , with
u, v ∈C[z] and (u, v) = 1, of the diﬀerential equations any(n) + · · · + a0y = 0
with ai ∈C[z], an ̸= 0. This equation is regular at any point c ∈C (i.e., the
algebraic closure of C) which is not a root of an. Hence y has no pole at such
point c. It follows that any irreducible factor q of v is a divisor of an. The
problem that we have to solve is to determine the exact power qm which divides
v. As an example, the equation zy′ + 5y = 0 has solution z−5.
More generally, consider the equation y(n) + an−1y(n−1) + · · · + a1y(1) +
a0y = 0 where some of the an−1, . . . , a0 ∈C(z) have a pole at 0. Now we
make a calculation in the diﬀerential ﬁeld C((z)) and write y =
u
v = zα +
· · · (where α ∈Z has to be found) and ai = 
m≥αi ai,mzm for i = 0, . . . , n
(where an = 1) for their Laurent series. We consider among the Laurent series
y(n), an−1y(n−1), . . . , a1y(1), a0y the ones with (potentially) the smallest order
at 0 (this does not depend on α). The sum of the leading coeﬃcients of these
Laurent series must be zero. This yields an equation

i∈S
ai,αiα(α −1) · · · (α −i + 1) = 0,
where the sum is taken over the subset S of {0, . . ., n} corresponding to the
selected Laurent series. I(T ) := 
i∈S ai,αiT (T −1) · · · (T −i + 1) is called
the indicial polynomial of the equation at 0. This polynomial is nonzero and
its roots (in an algebraic closure of C) are called the local exponents of the
equation at 0. We conclude that the possible values m > 0 for the exact power
zm dividing v are the negative integers −m with I(−m) = 0.
Now we perform a similar calculation at ∞. This means that we work in the
Laurent series ﬁeld C((z−1)) and develop the putative solution y = u
v ∈C(z)∗
and the a0, . . . , an as Laurent series in the variable z−1. The Laurent series of
y in z−1 has the form y = zα + ∗zα−1 + · · · with α = degz v −degz u. There
results an indicial polynomial equation for ∞of which α is a root. We conclude
that the possible values for degz v −degz u are found.
We suppose now that the largest possible denominator ˜v of the putative solu-
tion y has been found. Then for the degree of the numerator u there are ﬁnitely
many possibilities. One chooses again the largest possibility d, and writes u as a

4.1. RATIONAL AND EXPONENTIAL SOLUTIONS
107
polynomial u0 +u1z +· · ·+ud−1zd−1 +udzd with yet unknown coeﬃcients. The
diﬀerential equation for y translates into a set of homogeneous linear equations
for u0, . . . , ud. Let U denote the C-linear subspace of polynomials u of degree
≤d satisfying these linear equations. Then { u
˜v |u ∈U} is the C-vector space of
all solutions y ∈C(z) of our diﬀerential equation.
Therefore the algorithm will be completed once we have generalized the
above example of a power of z dividing the denominator to the case of a monic
irreducible q ∈C[z]. Further we are also interested in the solutions y in the
ﬁeld C(z). Propositions 4.1 and 4.3 give the formalities of this approach.
Let an irreducible monic polynomial q ∈C[z] be given. One associates to
q a map vq : C(z) →Z ∪{∞} by vq(0) = ∞and vq(f) = m if f ̸= 0 can be
written as f = a
b qm where a, b ∈C[z], (a, q) = (b, q) = 1 and m ∈Z. This map
is called a discrete valuation of C(z) over C. The map v∞: C(z) →Z ∪{∞}
deﬁned by v∞(0) = ∞and v∞( a
b ) = degz b −degz a for a, b ∈C[z], a, b ̸= 0,
is also a discrete valuation of C(z) over C. The integers vq(f) and v∞(f) for
f ∈C(z)∗are called the order of f at the place q and the order of f at inﬁnity .
The above examples are in fact all discrete valuations of C(z) over C. One can
complete the ﬁeld C(z) with respect to any discrete valuation. The resulting
ﬁelds will be denoted by kq or k∞([169], Ch.XII). For q = z −a with a ∈C,
this completion is easily seen to be the ﬁeld of formal Laurent series C((z −a)).
Further k∞= C((z−1)) . For a q of degree > 1 the ﬁeld kq is isomorphic to
k′((t)) with k′ = C[z]/(q) and t an indeterminate.
The derivation on C(z)
uniquely extends to a continuous derivation on kq and on k∞. The elements
f ∈kq can also be uniquely represented as an inﬁnite sum
fmqm + fm+1qm+1 + · · ·
where each fi ∈C[z] satisﬁes degz fi < degz q. This is called the q-adic expan-
sion of f . One sees by induction that
f (j) = ujqm−j + · · ·
where uj ≡m(m−1) . . . (m−j+1)fn·(q′)j mod q. Since fn and q′ are relatively
prime to q, we see that uj ̸= 0 if m < 0. The elements of the completion at
inﬁnity k∞= C((z−1)), can uniquely be written as inﬁnite sums
f = fmzm + fm−1zm−1 + · · ·
where the fi are constants and this is called the expansion at inﬁnity of f. For
the jth-derivative of f one has the formula
f (j) = m(m −1) · · · (m −j + 1)fmzm−j + · · ·
We begin by describing the C-space of solutions of Ly = 0 in C(z).
Proposition 4.1 Let L = ∂n + an−1∂n−1 + · · · + a0 be a linear diﬀerential
operator with coeﬃcients in C(z). One can ﬁnd, in a ﬁnite number of steps, a
C-basis of V , the space of solutions in C(z) of Ly = 0.

108
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
Proof.
For convenience of notation, we let an = 1. Let y ̸= 0 be a putative
solution of Ly = 0 and let q be a monic irreducible element of C[z]. We let
y
=
yαqα + . . .
ai
=
ai,αiqαi + · · ·
be the q-adic expansions of y and the ai. We are only interested in the case
α < 0.
As remarked before this implies that q divides the denominator of
some ai.
Thus the ﬁnite set of q’s that we have to consider is known.
For
each q we have to ﬁnd the possibilities for the exact power of q dividing the
denominator of y.
As before, we consider the q-expansions of the elements
y(n), an−1y(n−1), . . . , a0y with lowest order. The sum of their leading coeﬃcients
must be 0, since L(y) = 0. Thus for some subset S of {0, 1, . . ., n}, independent
of α one has

i∈S
ai,αiα(α −1) · · · (α −i + 1)yα(q′)i ≡0 mod q .
Dividing by yα and replacing α by T yields a nonzero polynomial
I(T ) :=

i∈S
ai,αiT (T −1) · · · (T −i + 1)(q′)imod q = 0 ∈C[z]/(q)[T ]
called (as before) the indicial polynomial of L at the place q.
The roots of
the indicial polynomial (in an algebraic extension of C[z]/(q)) are called (as
before) the local exponents of L at the place q. We conclude that the negative
integer α should be a root of the indicial polynomial. The assumption on the
ﬁeld C guarantees that one can calculate the possible α ’s. This completes the
exposition of the algorithm. We note that in case the indicial polynomial for
some q has no negative integer as root, then there are no rational solutions ̸= 0
of L.

4.1. RATIONAL AND EXPONENTIAL SOLUTIONS
109
We shall now show that the C-vector space V of solutions of Ly = 0 in C(z)
has a C-basis of elements in C(z). This follows from the general result
Proposition 4.3 Let K be a diﬀerential ﬁeld of characteristic zero with subﬁeld
of constants C. Consider a linear diﬀerential operator L = ∂n + an−1∂n−1 +
· · · + a0 over K and let V ⊂K denote the C-vector space of the solutions of L
in K. Let C be an algebraic closure of C and let V ⊂CK be the solution space
of L on CK. The natural C-linear map C ⊗C V →V is an isomorphism.
Proof.
Let v1, . . . , vm be a C-basis of V .
There exists a c ∈C such that
K(v1, . . . , vm) ⊂K(c). Let [K(c) : K] = t. For each i, 1 ≤i ≤m, there exist
vi,j ∈K such that vi = t−1
j=0 vi,jcj. Since 0 = L(vi) = t−1
j=0 L(vi,j)cj, we
have that the vi,j span V and therefore, V has a basis in K. Corollary 1.13
implies that any C-basis of V remains linearly independent over C. Therefore
dimC V = dimC V .
2
Exercise 4.4 Inhomogeneous equations. Let L be as in Proposition 4.3 and
f ∈K. Show that Ly = f has a solution in CK if and only if it has a solution
in K. Hint: CK is an algebraic extension of K. Consider for a solution y ∈CK
of Ly = f all its conjugates.
2
Remarks 4.5 1. A C-structure on a vector space W over C is a C-subspace
W0 of W such that W = C⊗C W0. The previous proposition gives a C-structure
on V . In [126], the authors show how one can put a C-structure on the entire
solution space contained in a Picard-Vessiot extension of C(z) associated with a
linear diﬀerential equation with coeﬃcients in C(z). This is used to understand
the smallest subﬁeld of C(z) needed when one is searching for a solution of the
Riccati equation (c.f., Deﬁnition 4.6) in C(z). We note that Proposition 4.3 also
appears in [57] and [126].
2. The algorithm in the proof of Proposition 4.1 can be improved in several ways.
For example, there are more eﬃcient algorithms to ﬁnd polynomial solutions of
linear diﬀerential equations. These and related matters are discussed in [2], [4],
[5], [57].
3. In many situations one is given a system Y ′ = AY of diﬀerential equations
where A is an n × n matrix with coeﬃcients in C(z) and asked to determine
a basis for all solutions in C(z)n.
In theory, by ﬁnding a cyclic vector, one
can reduce this problem to ﬁnding all solutions of an associated scalar equation
Ly = 0 in C(z) but ﬁnding this associated equation can be costly. An algorithm
to ﬁnd rational solutions of the system Y ′ = AY directly has been given by
Barkatou [22] and Abramov-Bronstein [3].

Exponential Solutions

110
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
We will keep the following notations. k is a diﬀerential ﬁeld of characteristic 0
and let C be its ﬁeld of constants. Fix L = ∂n+an−1∂n−1+· · ·+a0 ∈k[∂] and a
Picard-Vessiot extension K for L over the ﬁeld Ck. Let V := {y ∈K| L(y) = 0}
be the solution space of L in K and write G ⊂GL(V ) for the diﬀerential
Galois group of L. A nonzero element y ∈V ⊂K with L(y) = 0 is called an
exponential solution of L if u := y′
y lies in Ck. We will sometimes write, as a
formal notation, y = e
 u. Our aim is to compute the exponential solutions. We
begin by reviewing some facts concerning the Riccati equation (c.f., Remarks
3.20). Let y, u ∈K satisfy y′ = uy. Formally diﬀerentiating this identity yields
y(i) = Pi(u, u′, . . . u(i−1))y where the Pi are polynomials with integer coeﬃcients
satisfying P0 = 1 and Pi = P ′
i−1 + uPi−1. Furthermore, y ̸= 0 satisﬁes Ly = 0
if and only if u := y′
y satisﬁes
R(u) = Pn(u, . . . , u(n−1)) + an−1Pn−1(u, . . . , u(n−2)) + · · · + a0 = 0 (4.2)
Deﬁnition 4.6 Equation (4.2) is called the Riccati equation associated with
Ly = 0.
2
Exercise 4.7 Riccati Equations. 1. Show that v ∈Ck is a solution of the
Riccati equation if and only if ∂−v is a right hand factor of L (i.e., L = ˜L◦(∂−v)
for some ˜L).
2. Show that v ∈K is a solution of the Riccati equation if and only if there is
a y ∈V ⊂K, y ̸= 0 with y′/y = v.
2
The following gives the group theoretic interpretation of exponential solu-
tions of a linear diﬀerential equation. Recall that a character of an algebraic
group G over C is a homomorphism χ : G →C
∗of algebraic groups.
Lemma 4.8 With the above notations one has:
1. An element y ∈V ⊂K, y ̸= 0 is an exponential solution if and only if
there is a character χ of G such that σ(y) = χ(σ)y for all σ ∈G.
2. If u ∈Ck is a solution of the Riccati equation then for some character χ
there is a y ∈Vχ := {v ∈V | σ(y) = χ(σ)y for all σ ∈G} such that y ̸= 0
and y′/y = u.
3. The G-invariant lines of V are in a one-to-one correspondence with the
solutions u ∈Ck of the Riccati equations.
4. The Riccati equation has an inﬁnite number of solutions in Ck if and only
if, for some χ, dimC Vχ ≥2. Furthermore, if the Riccati equation has
ﬁnitely many solutions in Ck then the number of solutions is at most n.

4.1. RATIONAL AND EXPONENTIAL SOLUTIONS
111
5. Let y1, y2 ∈V be two nonzero exponential solutions. Put ui = y′
i
yi . Then
y1, y2 belong to the same Vχ if and only if y1
y2 ∈Ck. The latter is also
equivalent to u1 −u2 has the form f ′
f for some f ∈Ck, f ̸= 0.
Proof.
1. Consider any σ ∈G. The element y′/y ∈Ck is invariant under G
and thus (σ(y)/y)′ = 0. Therefore, there is a cσ ∈C such that σ(y) = cσy.
Clearly, σ →cσ is a character. Conversely, if σ(y) = χ(σ)y for all σ ∈G, then
y′/y is left ﬁxed by G and so must be in Ck.
2. According to Exercise 4.7 u = y′
y for some nonzero element y of V . Now
apply part 1.
3. The condition y ∈Vχ for some character χ of G is clearly equivalent to Cy
being a G-invariant line. Now use 1. and 2.
4. Let χ1, . . . , χs denote the distinct characters of G such that the vector space
Vχj is ̸= 0. It is easily seen that the sum s
i=1 Vχi is a direct sum. Using 3.,the
statements easily follow.
5. y1, y2 belong to the same Vχ if and only if y1
y2 is invariant under G. The
latter is equivalent to y1
y2 ∈Ck and again (by logarithmic diﬀerentiation) with
u1 −u2 = f ′
f for some nonzero element f ∈Ck.
2
Now we specialize to the case k = C(z) and present an algorithm to ﬁnd all
exponential solutions for L ∈C(z)[∂].
Proposition 4.9 In addition to the above notations we suppose that k = C(z).
1. One can decide, in a ﬁnite number of steps, whether the Riccati equation
R(u) = 0 has a solution in C(z).
2. Suppose that the Riccati equation has solution(s) in C(z). Let χ1, . . . χs
denote the distinct characters of G such that Vχi ̸= 0.
Then one can
calculate solutions {ui}i=1,...,s ∈C(z) of the Riccati equation and for each
i a ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space Wi ⊂C[z] containing C such that
for each i one has Vχi = yiWi, where yi ∈K is the exponential solution
given by ui = y′
i
yi . Moreover ∪s
i=1{ui + w′
w |w ∈Wi, w ̸= 0} is the set of all
solutions in C(z) is the Riccati equation.
Proof.
The idea of the proof is to solve the Riccati equation locally at every
singular point and then glue the local solutions to a global solution. We consider
ﬁrst a local formal situation. Let 0 be a singular point of L. The solutions
u ∈C((z)) of the Riccati equation of L can be derived from the classiﬁcation
of formal diﬀerential equations of Chapter 3. More precisely, one writes u =

j≥2
cj
zj + r with r ∈z−1C[[z]]. Then the “truncation” [u]0 := 
j≥2
cj
zj of u
has the property that z[u]0 is an eigenvalue q ∈Q, as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.27,
which happens to lie in z−1C[z−1].
The Newton polygon method presented
in Chapter 3.3 actually computes the possibilities for these eigenvalues q (see

112
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
Remarks 3.55). In Exercise 4.10 we outline how the Newton polygon techniques
can be specialized and simpliﬁed to give this result directly.
Next we consider a putative solution u ∈C(z) of the Riccati equation. Let
S be the set of the singular points of L (possibly including ∞). For each α ∈S,
one calculates the ﬁnitely many possibilities for the truncated Laurent expansion
[u]α at α. After choosing for each α one of these possibilities one has u = ˜u + r
where ˜u = 
α∈S[u]α and the remainder r has the form 

∂to ∂−˜u and computes the new operator ˜L := L(∂−˜u).
We have now to investigate whether the Riccati equation of ˜L has a solution
r ∈C(z) of the above form.
For a singular point α ∈S the coeﬃcient cα
is seen to be a zero of the indicial polynomial of ˜L at α ( compare with the
case of rational solutions). At a regular point of L the putative solution u has
locally the form y′
y , where y ̸= 0 is a formal local solution of L. The order of
y at the regular point lies in {0, 1, . . ., n −1} and thus cα ∈{0, 1, . . ., n −1}.
We note that it is, a priori, not possible to ﬁnd the regular points α for L
where cα ̸= 0. After choosing for each singular point α a possibility for cα, the
putative r has the form r = 
α∈S
cα
z−α + F ′
F , where F is a polynomial in C[z].
The possible degree of F can be found by calculating a truncated local solution
of the Riccati equation of ˜L at ∞. Let d be a possible degree for F. Then one
puts F = f0 + f1z + · · · + fdzd, with yet unknown coeﬃcients f0, . . . , fd. The
Riccati equation for r translates into a linear diﬀerential equation for F, which is
equivalent to a system of homogenous linear equations for f0, . . . , fd. This ends
the algorithm for the ﬁrst part of the proposition. In trying all possibilities for
the truncations [u]α and the coeﬃcients cα for the singular points one obtains
in an obvious way the second part of the proposition.

Exercise 4.10 Rational solutions of the Riccati equation.
In Proposition 4.9 we made use of the Newton polygon to ﬁnd the possibilities
for the truncation [u]α of a rational solution u of the Riccati equation at the
singular point α. In this exercise, the Newton polygon method is adapted to
the present situation (c.f., [268]). For convenience we suppose that C = C.
1. Let u ∈C(z).
(i) Let u = cz−γ + · · · ∈C((z)) with c ∈C∗, γ ≥1.
Use the relation
Pi+1 = P ′
i + uPi to show that:
(a) If γ > 1, then Pi(u, u′, . . . , u(i−1)) = ciz−iγ + · · · .
(b) if γ = 1, then Pi(u, u′, . . . , u(i−1)) = i−1
j=0(c −j)z−i + · · · .
(ii) Find the translation of (i) at the point ∞. In other words, u is now consid-
ered as an element of C((z−1)).
2. Let L be as in Equation 4.1 and let R(u) := n
i=1 aiPi = 0 be the associated
Riccati equation. Let u ∈C(z) be a putative solution of R(u) = 0 and let
u = cz−γ + · · · ∈C((z)), with c ∈C∗and γ > 1, be its Laurent expansion.
Derive from R(u) = 0 and part 1. an equation for γ and c. Show that there are
only ﬁnitely many possibilities for cz−γ.

4.1. RATIONAL AND EXPONENTIAL SOLUTIONS
113
3. Choose a possible term cz−γ from part 2. Indicate how one can ﬁnd a possible
truncations [u]0 of solutions u = cz−γ + · · · ∈C((z)) by repeating part 2. Hint:
Replace the operator L =  ai∂i by ˜L(∂) = L(∂+ cz−γ).
4. Indicate how one can change the operator L into one or more operators ˜L
such that the problem of ﬁnding rational solutions of the Riccati equation of L
is translated into ﬁnding rational solutions of the Riccati equation of ˜L having
the form u = p +  uα/(z −α) where uα, α ∈C and p ∈C[z].
Now we concentrate on ﬁnding solutions u of R(u) = 0 having this form. Sup-
pose that α ∈C is a pole of some ai, i.e., a singular point of L. Find an equation
for uα (this is again an indicial equation) and show that there are only ﬁnitely
many possibilities for uα. Show that one can modify L such that the putative
u has the form u = P ′/P + p where P, p ∈C[z] and P has no roots in common
with a denominator of any ai.
5. Use 1.(ii) and calculations similar to those in 2., to produce ﬁnitely many
possibilities for the polynomial p. Modify the operator L such that u = P ′/P.
Now use Proposition 4.1 to ﬁnd the polynomial solutions of the modiﬁed linear
diﬀerential equation.
2
Note that the proof of Proposition 4.9 (or the above exercise) implies that
a solution u of the Riccati equation must be of the form
u
=
P ′
P + Q + R
S
(4.3)
where P, Q, R, S ∈C[z], the zeroes of S are singular points and the zeroes of
P are nonsingular points. We can therefore select S to be a product of the
irreducible factors of the denominators of the ai and so have it lie in C[z]. The
next examples show that, in general, one cannot assume that P, Q, R ∈C[z].
Examples 4.11 1. The functions √z −i, √z + i (with i2 = −1) form a basis
of the solution space of y′′ −
1
z2+1y′ +
1
4(z2+1)y = 0. One then sees that the only
solutions in Q(z) of the associated Riccati equation are
z±i
2z2+2. Thus the above
R does not lie in Q[z].
2. The functions (z + i)eiz, (z −i)e−iz form a basis of the solution space of
y′′ −2
zy′ + y = 0. The only solutions in Q(z) of the associated Riccati equation
are {
1
z+i + i,
1
z−i −i}. Thus the above P and Q do not belong to Q[z].
2
The algorithm in Proposition 4.9 goes back to Beke [28] (see also [254],
§177). There are two aspects that contribute to the computational complexity
of the above algorithm. The ﬁrst is combinatorial. At each singular point one
selects a candidate for terms of degree less than or equal to −1. If one uses
the Newton polygon method described in Chapter 3, one generates at most
n distinct candidates, where n is the order of the diﬀerential operator (see

114
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
Remarks 3.55). If there are m singular points then one may need to try nm
possibilities and test nm transformed diﬀerential equations to see if they have
polynomial solutions. The second is the apparent need to work in algebraic
extensions of C of large degree over C.
In [137], van Hoeij gives methods to deal with the combinatorial explosion in
this algorithm and the problem of large ﬁeld extensions of C (as well as a similar
problem encountered when one tries to factor linear operators). The method
also avoids the use of the Gr¨obner basis algorithm. Roughly speaking it works
as follows. One makes a good choice of a singular point of the operator L and
a formal local right hand factor of degree 1 at this point. After a translation of
the variable (z →z + c or z →z−1) and a shift ∂→∂+ f with f ∈C(z), the
operator L has a right hand factor of the form ∂−y′
y with an explicit y ∈C[[z]].
Now one tries to ﬁnd out whether y′
y belongs to C(z). Equivalently, one tries
to ﬁnd a linear relation between y and y′ over C[z]. This is carried out by Pad´e
approximation. The method extends to ﬁnding right hand factors of higher
degree and applies in that case a generalization of the Pad´e approximation. This
local-to-global approach works very well in practice and has been implemented
in Maple V.5.
One can also proceed as follows (c.f., [56], [219]). Let α be a ﬁxed singular point.
We may write a rational solution of the Riccati equation as
u = eα + fα
where eα =
anγ ,γ
(z−α)nγ + · · · + a1,γ
z−α and fα = b0,γ + b1,γ(z −α) + · · · . One can
calculate (at most) n possibilities for eα. We shall refer to eα as a principal part
at α. One then considers the new diﬀerential equation ˜L(∂) = L(∂−eα). The
term fα will be of the form y′/y for some power series solution y of ˜Ly = 0. One
can use the classical Frobenius algorithm to calculate (to arbitrary precision) a
basis y1, . . . , yt of these power series solutions. Since fα is a rational function,
one must decide if there are any constants c1, . . . , ct such that (c1y1+···+ctyt)′
(c1y1+...+ctyt) is
rational and such that eα + (c1y1+···+ctyt)′
(c1y1+···+ctyt) is a solution of the Riccati equation.
This can be done as follows.
One ﬁrst calculates a bound N (see the next paragraph) on the degrees of
the numerators and denominators of possible rational solutions of the Riccati
equation. One then uses the ﬁrst 2N + 1 terms of the power series expansions
of (c1y1+···+ctyt)′
(c1y1+···+ctyt) to ﬁnd a Pad´e approximant ˜fα [27] of (c1y1+···+ctyt)′
(c1y1+···+ctyt) and then
one substitutes eα+ ˜fα into the Riccati equation and determines if there are any
ci that make this equation vanish. More concretely, given N, we may assume
that the value of c1y1 + · · · + ctyt at z = α is 1 and write
(c1y1 + · · · + ctyt)′
(c1y1 + · · · + ctyt) = d0(c1, · · · , ct) + d1(c1, · · · , dt)(z −α)+
+ · · · + d2N(c1, · · · , ct)(z −α)2Nmod (z −α)2N+1

4.1. RATIONAL AND EXPONENTIAL SOLUTIONS
115
where the d1, . . . , d2N are polynomials in the ci that can be calculated using the
power series expansions of the yi. One now must decide if there exist hi, gi such
that
˜fα = hN(z −α)N + · · · + h0
gN(z −α)N + · · · + g0
= d0(c1, · · · , ct) + d1(c1, · · · , dt)(z −α)+
+ · · · + d2N(c1, · · · , ct)(z −α)2N mod (z −α)2N+1
Multiplying both sides of the above equation by gN(z −α)N + · · · + g0 and
comparing the ﬁrst 2N + 1 powers of z −α yields a system S of polynomial
equations in the ci, gi, hi that are linear in the gi and hi but nonlinear in the
ci.
Substituting u = eα + ˜fα into the Riccati equation R(u) = 0, clearing
denominators and equating powers of z −α yields another system of nonlinear
polynomial equations ˜S. One can then use Gr¨obner basis methods to decide if
there are ci such that the system S ∪˜S is solvable.
We now show how one can calculate a bound N on the degrees of the nu-
merator and denominator of a rational solution of the Riccati equation. At each
singular point α ∈C one can calculate the possible principal parts. In particu-
lar, this allows one to ﬁnd the possible integers nα and so bound the degrees of
R and S in Equation 4.3. At ∞, one can also calculate possible principal parts
e∞= an∞,∞
tn∞
+ . . . + a1,∞
t
where t = 1
z. This allows one to bound the degree of
Q in Equation 4.3. Note that the constant a1,∞= deg P −
α a1,α. Therefore
once we have bounded (or determined) all the residues a1,α and a1,∞, we can
bound (or determine) the possible degrees of P in Equation 4.3. Therefore we
can ﬁnd the desired bound N. Note that although we have had to calculate mn
principal parts, we have avoided the necessity of testing exponentially many
combinations.
Both the algorithm in Proposition 4.9 and the above algorithm are presented
in a way that has one work in (possibly large) extensions of C. Several ways
to minimize this are given in [56],[57], and [137]. The examples above show
that extensions of C cannot be avoided. For an even simpler example, let p(z)
be an irreducible polynomial over Q(z). The solutions of p(∂)y = 0 are of the
form eαz where α is a root of p(z) = 0. Therefore each solution of the Riccati
equation is deﬁned over an extension of Q of degree equal to the order of p(∂).
Proposition 4.12 says that this is the worst that can happen.
Proposition 4.12 Let L be a linear diﬀerential operator of order n with coef-
ﬁcients in C(z) and let R(u) = 0 be the associated Riccati equation.
1. If there are only a ﬁnite number of solutions of R(u) = 0 in C(z) then
each of them lies in a ﬁeld of the form C0(z) where [C0 : C] ≤n.
2. If R(u) = 0 has an inﬁnite number of solutions in C(z) then there is a
solution in a ﬁeld of the form C0(z) where [C0 : C] ≤n
2 .

116
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
Proof.
We will let k = C(z) and use the notation of Lemma 4.8.
1. Let us assume that the Riccati equation has only a ﬁnite number of solutions.
In this case, Lemma 4.8 implies that there are at most n of these. The group
Aut(C/C) acts on C(z) and permutes these solutions. Therefore the orbit of
any solution of the Riccati equation has size at most n and so is deﬁned over a
ﬁeld of degree at most n over C.
2. One can prove this statement easily after introducing a Gal(C/C) action on
the solution space V ⊂K of the diﬀerential operator L. This operator has a
regular point in C and for notational convenience we assume that 0 is a regular
point for L. Then W := {y ∈C((z))| Ly = 0} is a C-vector space of dimension
n.
The ﬁeld C((z)) contains a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for L over C(z), namely
the diﬀerential subﬁeld generated over C(z) by all the elements of W. So we
may identify K with this subﬁeld of C((z)). The natural map C ⊗C W →V ,
where V ⊂K is the solution space V of L in K, is clearly bijective. The group
Gal(C/C) acts on C((z)) by σ(
n>>−∞anzn) = 
n>>−∞σ(an)zn.
This
action induces on the subﬁeld C(z) the natural action and the elements of W
are ﬁxed. Hence the subﬁeld K is invariant under this action. Moreover, the
action of Gal(C/C) on V is the one given by the isomorphism C ⊗C W →V .
Let χ1, . . . , χs denote the distinct characters of the diﬀerential Galois group
G such that the spaces Vχi are ̸= 0. By assumption and by Lemma 4.8 one of
these spaces, say Vχ1, has dimension ≥2. The group Gal(C/C) permutes the
spaces Vχi. Therefore the stabilizer H ⊂Gal(C/C) of Vχ1 is a closed subgroup
of index ≤n/2. Let C0 ⊃C denote the ﬁxed ﬁeld of H. Then [C0 : C] ≤n/2
and the subspace Vχ1 is invariant under the action of H = Gal(C/C0). The
action of H on Vχ1 yields a 1-cocycle class in H1(Gal(C/C0), GLd(C)), where d
is the dimension of Vχ1. This cohomology set is well known to be trivial ([260])
and it follows that Vχ1 has a basis of elements in C0 ⊗C W ⊂C0((z)). For such
a basis element y one has y′
y ∈C0((z)) ∩C(z) = C0(z) as required.
2
The above proposition appears in [126] and its proof applies to equations with
coeﬃcients in C((z)) as well. In this case the Riccati equation will always have
a solution in a ﬁeld whose degree over C((z)) is at most the order of L. In the
latter case, the result also follows from a careful analysis of the Newton polygon
or similar process (c.f., [83], [137], [171], [280]). Despite Proposition 4.12, we
know of no algorithm that, except in the case n = 2 (due to M. Berkenbosch [29]
and, independently, to M. van Hoeij, who has included it in his modiﬁcation
and implementation of the Kovacic algorithm), will compute a rational solution
of the Riccati equation that guarantees that all calculations are done in a ﬁeld
C0(z) with [C0 : C] ≤n.
We end this section by noting that an algorithm for computing exponential
solutions of linear diﬀerential systems is given in [219].

4.2. FACTORING LINEAR OPERATORS
117
4.2
Factoring Linear Operators
Let a diﬀerential module M over the ﬁeld C(z), or equivalently a matrix dif-
ferential operator ∂−A over C(z), be given. One ﬁnal goal for algorithmic
computations on M is to completely determine its Picard-Vessiot ring and its
diﬀerential Galois group. For the case C = C, many new questions arise, e.g.,
concerning monodromy groups, asymptotic behaviour, Stokes matrices etc. Here
we will restrict to the possibility of computing the Picard-Vessiot ring and the
diﬀerential Galois group.
Let M m
n denote the tensor product M ⊗· · · ⊗M ⊗M ∗⊗· · · ⊗M ∗(with
n factors M and m factors M ∗, and M ∗denotes the dual of M). From the
Tannakian point of view, complete information on the Picard-Vessiot ring and
the diﬀerential Galois group is equivalent to having a complete knowledge of
all the diﬀerential submodules of ﬁnite direct sums of the M m
n . Thus the basic
problem is to ﬁnd for a given diﬀerential module M all its submodules. We
recall that M has a cyclic vector and is therefore isomorphic to C(z)[∂]/C(z)[∂]L
for some monic diﬀerential operator L. The submodules of M are in one-to-
one correspondence with the monic right hand factors of L.
Therefore the
central problem is to factor diﬀerential operators. We will sketch a solution
for this problem. This solution does not produce a theoretical algorithm for
the computation of the Picard-Vessiot ring and the diﬀerential Galois group.
Indeed, following this approach, one has to compute the submodules of inﬁnitely
many direct sums of the modules M m
n . Nonetheless, algorithms modifying this
approach have been given in [71] for the case when the diﬀerential Galois group
is known to be reductive. An algorithm for the general case is recently presented
in [140].
In order to simplify this exposition we will assume that C is algebraically
closed. Computing the rational solutions for a diﬀerential operator L ∈C(z)[∂]
translates into ﬁnding the C-linear vector space {m ∈M|∂m = 0}, where
M is the dual of the diﬀerential module C(z)[∂]/C(z)[∂]L. M.A. Barkatou and
E. Pﬂ¨ugel, [22, 24], have developed (and implemented in their ISOLDE package)
eﬃcient methods to do this computation directly on the diﬀerential module
(i.e., its associated matrix diﬀerential equation) without going to a diﬀerential
operator by choosing a cyclic vector. Computing the exponential solutions of a
diﬀerential operator translates into ﬁnding the 1-dimensional submodules of M.
Again there is an eﬃcient algorithm by M.A. Barkatou and E. Pﬂ¨ugel directly
for the diﬀerential module (instead of an associated diﬀerential operator). Let
I1, . . . , Is denote a maximal set of non isomorphic 1-dimensional submodules of
M. The sum of all 1-dimensional submodules of M is given as a direct sum
N1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ns ⊂M, where each Ni is a direct sum 1-dimensional submodules,
isomorphic to Ii. This decomposition translates into the direct sum ⊕Vχ ⊂
V , taken over all characters χ of the diﬀerential Galois group considered in
Lemma 4.8.

118
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
4.2.1
Beke’s Algorithm
Now we consider the problem of ﬁnding the submodules of dimension d of a
given module M. We will explain the method, which goes back to Beke [28], in
terms of diﬀerential modules. Let N ⊂M be a d-dimensional submodule. Then
ΛdN is a 1-dimensional submodule of the exterior power ΛdM. Of the latter
we suppose that the 1-dimensional submodules are known. A 1-dimensional
submodule P of ΛdM has the form ΛdN if and only if P is generated by a
decomposable vector, i.e., a vector of the form m1 ∧· · · ∧md. Some multilinear
algebra is needed to characterize the decomposable vectors in ΛdM. We outline
this, more information can be found in [114], [122], [133].
Let A be a vector space of dimension n over some ﬁeld F. One denotes
by A∗the dual vector space.
There are contraction operators i : ΛkA∗→
HomF (ΛlA, Λl−kA) for k ≤l and i : ΛkA∗→HomF (ΛlA, Λk−lA∗) for l ≤k.
For k = 1 and l > 1, the formula for the contraction operator i reads
i(L)(v1 ∧· · · ∧vl) =
l

j=1
(−1)j−1L(vj)v1 ∧· · · vj · · · ∧vl,
where L is an element of V ∗, v1, . . . , vl ∈V and where vj means that this term
is removed.
The formulas for the general case are similar.
One shows that
an element a ∈ΛdA (with 1 < d < n) is decomposable if and only if for every
b ∈Λd+1A∗the expression i(i(b)a)a is zero. These relation are called the Pl¨ucker
relations. Choose a basis e1, . . . , en for A and write a = 
i1<···<id ai1,...,idei1 ∧
· · · ∧eid. Then for every b ∈Λd+1A∗the equation i(i(b)a)a = 0 is equivalent
with a set of quadratic equations for the coeﬃcients ai1,...,id of a.
For the
case d = 2 this simpliﬁes to the element a ∧a ∈Λ4A is zero. The latter is
equivalent with

n
4

quadratic equations for the coeﬃcients of a. We note that
for a decomposable a = a1 ∧· · · ∧ad ∈ΛdA the vector space generated by
a1, . . . , ad ∈A can also be found by applying i(b) to a for all b ∈Λd−1A∗.
We apply this to ΛdM. As above, the 1-dimensional submodules of this space
form a direct sum N1(d)⊕· · ·⊕Ns(d) (where the d indicates that we are working
in ΛdM). We pick one of these spaces, say Ni(d), and give it a basis w1, . . . , wt.
The Pl¨ucker relations are applied to a general element f1w1 + · · · + ftwt with
all fi ∈C(z).
Solving these quadratic equations leads to all d-dimensional
submodules of M. The quadratic equations are over the ﬁeld C(z). One can
replace them by quadratic equations over C in the following way. Consider a
regular point in C for M. For notational convenience we suppose that 0 is this
regular point. Replace the module M by a matrix diﬀerential equation
d
dz + A,
with a matrix A which has no poles at 0. This matrix equation has a (unique)
fundamental matrix F with coeﬃcients in C[[z]] such that F(0) = 1. Likewise
ΛdM has a fundamental matrix G with coeﬃcients in C[[z]] and G(0) = 1,
obtained by taking the dth exterior power of F. Evaluating, the above elements
w1, . . . , wt and f1, . . . , ft at z = 0 translates the Pl¨ucker relations over the ﬁeld
C(z) to equivalent Pl¨ucker relations over the ﬁeld C.

4.2. FACTORING LINEAR OPERATORS
119
In order to make the above into an actual (and eﬃcient) algorithm, one has
to give the translation in terms of matrix diﬀerential operators. Let e1, . . . , en
be a basis of the diﬀerential module M. Let A be the matrix of ∂w.r.t. this
basis. Thus ∂can be identiﬁed with the matrix operator
d
dz + A on the space
C(z)n. Then ΛdM has basis {ei1 ∧· · · ∧eid| i1 < · · · < id}. The operator ∂on
ΛdM is deﬁned by ∂(w1 ∧· · · ∧wd) = 
i w1 ∧· · · ∧(∂wi) ∧· · · ∧wd. From this
one easily obtains the matrix diﬀerential operator for ΛdM. The algorithms of
M.A. Barkatou and E. Pﬂ¨ugel can now be put into action.
Remarks 4.13
(1) The original formulation of Beke’s algorithm uses diﬀerential equations (or
diﬀerential operators). This has several disadvantages. One has to use certain
complicated minors of the Wronskian matrix of a basis y1, . . . , yn of the solutions
of the degree n operator L ∈C(z)[∂].
Let M = C(z)[∂]/C(z)[∂]L be the
diﬀerential module associated to L. Write e for the image of 1 in M. This is the
cyclic vector corresponding to L. A natural element of the exterior product ΛdM
is e∧∂e∧· · · ∧∂d−1e. However, this element is not always a cyclic vector. Thus
some work has to be done to produce a cyclic vector and a suitable diﬀerential
operator for ΛdM. This diﬀerential operator can be of high complexity etc. We
note also that Beke’s original algorithm did not take the Pl¨ucker relation into
account. Tsarev [283] gives essential improvements to Beke’s original algorithm
and puts the Pl¨ucker relation into action.
(2) One may insist on working with diﬀerential operators, and on producing
rational and exponential solutions as explained above. There is a way out of
the problem of the cyclic vector and its high complexity for the exterior power
by applying the method of [134].
There the matrix diﬀerential operator for
a construction of linear algebra, applied to a diﬀerential operator, is used to
produce the relevant information. Actually,one has to make a small variation
on their method described for symmetric powers and eigenrings.
(3) Other improvements to the Beke algorithm have been given by several au-
thors [56], [58], [60], [256]. In [116], Grigoriev also gives simpliﬁcations of the
Beke algorithm as well as a detailed complexity analysis. An algorithm for de-
termining the reducibility of a diﬀerential system is given in [115]. A method
to enumerate all factors of a diﬀerential operator is given in [284].
(4) As remarked earlier, van Hoeij [137] gives methods to factor diﬀerential op-
erators that are not based on Beke’s algorithm. In this paper, he uses algorithms
that ﬁnd local factorizations (i.e., factors with coeﬃcients in C((z))) and applies
an adapted version of Pad´e approximation to produce a global factorization. 2
Example 4.14 We illustrate Beke’s algorithm to ﬁnd all the right hand factors
of order 2 of L = ∂4 −∂3 over the ﬁeld Q(z).
The diﬀerential module M := Q(z)[∂]/Q(z)[∂]L has basis {∂ie| i = 0, . . . , 3}.
It is easily seen to have a basis e1, . . . , e4 such that ∂ei = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3 and

120
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
∂e4 = e4. The diﬀerential module Λ2M has basis {ei ∧ej|1 ≤i < j ≤4}. We
are looking for the 1-dimensional submodules. Such a module is generated by
an element a = 
1≤i<j≤4 ai,jei ∧ej with coeﬃcients in Q[z] such that ∂a is a
multiple of a. Moreover, the Pl¨ucker relation a ∧a = 0 translates into
a1,2a3,4 −a1,3a2,4 + a1,4a2,3 = 0. One writes
a =

1≤i<j≤3
ai,jei ∧ej + (

i=1,2,3
biei) ∧e4
and ﬁnds that ∂a = 
1≤i<j≤3 a′
i,jei ∧ej + (
i=1,2,3((bi + b′
i)ei) ∧e4.
Us-
ing degrees in z one ﬁnds that ∂a = λa implies that λ is a constant and in
fact λ can only be 0 or 1. This yields two vector spaces of solutions, namely

1≤i<j≤3 ai,jei ∧ej with ai,j constants and (3
i=1 biei) ∧e4 with b1, b2, b3 con-
stants. Both families satisfy the Pl¨ucker relation. This yields two families of
2-dimensional submodules N of M, namely:

4.2.2
Eigenring and Factorizations
Another method, not based on Beke’s algorithm, is given in [270]. This method
uses the eigenring (c.f., Proposition 2.13). It does not always factor reducible
operators (see Exercise 2.14) but does often yield factors quickly. We will show
that the method does factor all reducible completely reducible operators (c.f.,
Deﬁnition 2.37).
We recall and continue the discussion of the eigenring in Sections 2.2 and 2.4.
Consider instead of a diﬀerential operator L of degree n, the associated diﬀer-
ential module M over C(z). We assume for convenience that C is algebraically
closed. The eigenring E(M) of M consists of all C(z)-linear maps B : M →M,
which commute with ∂. One of the constructions of linear algebra applied to
M is the diﬀerential module Hom(M, M) (isomorphic to M ∗⊗M). Then the
eigenring of M is the C-algebra of the rational solutions of Hom(M, M). Clearly
1M ∈E(M) and the dimension of E(M) is ≤n2. This dimension is equal to n2
if and only if M is a direct sum of n copies of a 1-dimensional module.
Suppose that E(M) contains an element B which is not a multiple of the
identity. The elements 1, B, B2, . . . , Bn2 ∈E(M) are linearly dependent over C.

4.2. FACTORING LINEAR OPERATORS
121
One can easily calculate the monic polynomial I(T ) ∈C[T ] of minimal degree
satisfying I(B) = 0. Let c ∈C be a root of I(T ). Then B−c1M is not invertible
and is not 0. Hence the kernel of B −c1M is a non trivial submodule of M.
An interpretation of the eigenring E(M) is the following. Let V denote the
solution space of M provided with the action of the diﬀerential Galois group
G. Then every B ∈E(M) induces a C-linear map ˜B : V →V commuting with
the action of G. The above polynomial I(T ) is the minimum polynomial of ˜B.
Conversely, any C-linear map V →V , commuting with the action of G, is a ˜B
for a unique B ∈E(M).
For the actual calculation of E(M) one replaces M by a matrix diﬀerential
operator d
dz +A. The B that we are looking for are now the matrices commuting
with
d
dz + A.
In other terms, they are the rational solutions of the matrix
diﬀerential equation B′ = BA −AB. Suppose for convenience that A has no
poles at 0. Then one can give the solution space V of M the interpretation of
the kernel of
d
dz + A operating on C[[z]]n. Every solution is determined by its
constant term. In this way, one ﬁnds the action of a B ∈E(M) on V explicitly.
This method is useful for determining the algebra structure of E(M).
Direct decompositions of a given diﬀerential module M correspond to idem-
potent elements of E(M). They can be computed as follows. Let B1, . . . , Br be
a C-basis of E(M). Consider any C-linear combination e := λ1B1 + · · · + λrBr.
Then e2 = e yields a set of quadratic equations for λ1, . . . , λr with, a priori coef-
ﬁcients in C(z). The above method of evaluation at z = 0 turns these equations
into quadratic equations over C.
Suppose that the diﬀerential module M is completely reducible. According to
Proposition 2.40 the eigenring E(M) is a direct product of the matrix algebras
Mni(C) for i = 1, . . . , s.
Thus the above method will produce a complete
decomposition of M as direct sum of irreducible submodules.
We return now to the diﬀerential operator L ∈D := C(z)[∂] of degree n. We
recall (c.f. 2.13) that the eigenring E(L) is also the eigenring of the diﬀerential
module M := D/DL. Moreover E(L) is described by
E(L) = {R ∈D| deg R < n and there exists S ∈D with LR = SL}
One can make the above condition on R explicit by writing R = R0 + R1∂+
· · · + Rn−1∂n−1 and dividing LR on the right by L with a remainder. Thus
LR = FL + ˜R0 + ˜R1∂+ · · · + ˜Rn−1∂n−1 Each ˜Ri is formally a linear homo-
geneous expression in R0, . . . , Rn−1 and their derivatives. Then R ∈E(L) if
and only if ˜Ri = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n −1. These equations are sometimes called
the eigenequations of L. We note that these equations, written as a diﬀeren-
tial equation for the matrix (R(j)
i )n
i,j=1 is equivalent to the matrix diﬀerential
equation B′ = BA −AB which we have encountered above.
In [270] general methods are given for determining dimC E(L). For example,
using Exercise 2.4.2, one can ﬁnd operators L1, . . . , Ln such that there is an
eﬀective correspondence between the solutions of L1(Z1) = 0, . . . , Ln(Zn) = 0

122
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
and the solutions of the eigenequations.
One can then use the methods of
Section 4.1 to ﬁnd solutions of this former system in C(z). Other techniques for
ﬁnding E(L) are discussed in [18] and [136].
Exercise 4.15 Let L be the diﬀerential operator
∂4 + (2 + 2z2)∂2 + 4z∂+ (4 + 2z2 + z4)
say over the diﬀerential ﬁeld Q(z). Try to prove that E(L) is isomorphic to the
matrix algebra M2(Q). Hint: Use a computer.

We will see in the next section that completely reducible operators arise
naturally. A test for complete reducibility of operators over C(z) (with C alge-
braically closed) is given in [270] and this is extended to algebraic extensions of
C(z) in [71].
We end this section with an exercise giving a version of the Eisenstein irre-
ducibility criterion that can be applied to diﬀerential operators.
Exercise 4.16 Factorization over C(z) versus factorization over C[z].
(1) Show that z∂2 + z2∂−z = (∂+ z)(z∂−1). Note that each of the two
ﬁrst degree factors has coeﬃcients with g.c.d. 1, while z divides the coeﬃcients
of the product. Therefore a naive version of Gauss’s lemma is false for linear
operators over the ring C[z].
(2) Let L = ∂2 + z∂−1. Show that L factors over C(z) but that L cannot be
written as the product of ﬁrst degree operators with coeﬃcients in C[z]. Hint:
Show that z−1 is the only exponential solution of Ly = 0.
Despite these examples, Kovacic [165] gives the following Eisenstein-like cri-
terion for the irreducibility of a diﬀerential operator:
Let R be a diﬀerential integral domain with quotient ﬁeld F and let P be a
prime diﬀerential ideal in R. Assume that the local ring RP is principal. Let
L = l
i=0 ci∂i be a diﬀerential operator with coeﬃcients in R such that ci ∈P
for i = 1, . . . , l, c0 ̸∈P and cl ̸∈P 2. Then L is irreducible over F.
(3) Use the above criterion to show that if L = ∂2 + p, where p ∈C[z] is
of odd degree, then L is irreducible over C(z).
Hint: Let degz p = 2k + 1,
deﬁne δ = z−k∂and rewrite z−2k−1L as operator in δ with coeﬃcients in the
ring R = C[z−1].
The operator δ makes R into a diﬀerential domain with
diﬀerentiation given by r →z−k dr
dz. Show that the ideal P = z−1R is a prime
ideal and a diﬀerential ideal (with respect to this diﬀerentiation on R). Apply
now Kovacic’s criterion.

4.3
Liouvillian Solutions
In this section k is a diﬀerential ﬁeld with algebraically closed ﬁeld of constants
C (of characteristic 0).
Proposition 1.45 in Section 1.5 states that a linear

4.3. LIOUVILLIAN SOLUTIONS
123
diﬀerential equation Ly = 0 of order n over k which has a non-zero liouvillian
solution has also a liouvillian solution y ̸= 0 such that u := y′/y is algebraic over
k. In other words, the Riccati equation associated to Ly = 0 has a solution u
which is algebraic over k. Using some group theory we will prove that there is a
constant I(n), depending only on n, such that there is even an algebraic solution
of this Riccati equation with degree ≤I(n) over k. This leads to the following
method of testing whether the equation Ly = 0 has liouvillian solutions. For
each d with 1 ≤d ≤I(n) the existence of an algebraic solution u of degree
d over k of the Riccati equation is tested by calculating (special) exponential
solutions of the “dth-symmetric power of L”. If no solutions are found then
Ly = 0 has no liouvillian solutions ̸= 0. In the opposite case we indicate how
one determines the minimum polynomial of u over k. Special algorithms to ﬁnd
liouvillian solutions for second and third order operators will be discussed.
4.3.1
Group Theory
The group theory that we need is based on the following theorem of Jordan
([144], [145]; see also the exposition of Jordan’s ideas given by Dieudonn´e [84]).
It is interesting to note that Jordan proved this result in order to study algebraic
solutions of linear diﬀerential equations.
Theorem 4.17 Let C be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero.
There exists an integer valued function n →J(n) such that every ﬁnite subgroup
of GLn(C) contains an abelian normal subgroup of index at most J(n).
Various authors have given bounds for J(n). Blichtfeldt [39] showed that J(n) <
n!(6n−1)π(n+1)+1 where π(x) denoted the number of primes less than or equal
to x (see [86] for a modern presentation). One also ﬁnds the following values
of J(n) in [39]: J(2) = 12, J(3) = 360, and J(4) = 25920. Schur [255] showed
that J(n) ≤(
√
8n + 1)2n2 −(
√
8n −1)2n2 (see [76] for a modern exposition).
Other proofs can be found in [85] and [304].
Proposition 4.18 C is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero. A
subgroup G ⊂GLn(C) acts on P(Cn) = Pn−1(C), i.e., the set of lines in Cn
through 0. Suppose that G has some ﬁnite orbit on P(Cn), then it also has an
orbit of length at most I(n) := maxr≤n{[ n
r ]J(r)} .
Proof.
We may replace G by its Zariski closure in GLn(C) and suppose that
G is a linear algebraic group. Suppose that the line Cw ⊂V := Cn has a ﬁnite
orbit {Cw1, . . . , Cws} under G. Then H = {h ∈G| h(Cwi) = Cwi for all i}
is a normal subgroup of G of index ≤s!. Let χ1, . . . , χt denote the distinct
characters χi : H →C∗such that the vector space Vχi := {v ∈V |h(v) =
χi(h)v for all h ∈H} is not 0. Then V has ⊕t
i=1Vχi as subspace. Since H
is normal in G, one has that G permutes the spaces Vχi and ⊕t
i=1Vχi is a G-
invariant subspace. Consider the stabilizer H1 ⊂G of Vχ1. Then the index of

124
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
H1 in G is ≤t. Thus [G : H1] ≤[ n
r ], where r is the dimension of Vχ1. If r
happens to be 1, then the line Vχ1 has a G-orbit of length ≤n.
Now suppose r > 1.
The action of H1 on Vχ1 induces an action of the
ﬁnite group H1/H ⊂PGLr(C) = PSLr(C) on the projective space P(Vχ1) =
Pr−1(C). Indeed, H acts on Vχ1 via its character χ1. Let H2 ⊂SLr(C) be the
preimage of H/H1. One applies Theorem 4.17 to the ﬁnite group H2 and obtains
a normal abelian subgroup H3 ⊂H2 of index ≤J(r). The abelian subgroup H3
stabilizes some line L ⊂Vχ1. The H2-orbit of L has length ≤[H2 : H3] ≤J(r).
The H1-orbit of L coincides with the H2-orbit of L. Finally the G-orbit of L
has length ≤[G : H1] times the length of the H1-orbit of L. Thus the length of
the G-orbit of L is ≤[ n
r ]J(r).
2
Proposition 4.19 Suppose that the linear diﬀerential equation Ly = 0 of de-
gree n over k has a non-zero liouvillian solution. Then there is a solution y ̸= 0
such that u := y′
y is algebraic over k of degree ≤I(n).
Proof.
Let K ⊃k denote a Picard-Vessiot extension for the equation Ly = 0
over the ﬁeld k. One considers the action of the diﬀerential Galois group G of
Ly = 0 over k, on the solution space V := {y ∈K| L(y) = 0}. Suppose that
y ∈V, y ̸= 0 is such that u := y′
y ∈K is algebraic over k and has minimum
polynomial P(T ) ∈k[T ] of degree d. Then for any σ ∈G, the element σ(u) is
again a solution of P(T ) = 0. This implies that the connected component of
the identity Go of G acts trivial on u. In other words, u ∈KGo. By Galois
correspondence, KGo ⊃k is a Galois extension with Galois group G/Go. From
ordinary Galois theory it follows that the G-orbit of u consists of all the zeros
of P(T ) and has length d. This implies that the G-orbit of the line Cy ⊂V has
also length d.
On the other hand, a line Cy ⊂V which has a ﬁnite G-orbit yields an
element u :=
y′
y ∈K which has a ﬁnite G-orbit. Hence u is algebraic over
k. From the above it follows that its degree over k is equal to the length of
the G-orbit of Cy. Using this translation, an application of 4.18 ﬁnishes the
proof.
2
Weaker versions of Propositions 4.18 and 4.19 originally appeared in [264].
Proposition 4.18 can also be deduced from results of Platonov and Malcev (see
Remark 11.12 and [302], Theorem 3.6, p.45 and Corollary 10.11, p.142). The
present versions of Propositions 4.18 and 4.19 appear in [61]. In this paper, [289],
and [290] other results concerning sharper bounds on the degrees of algebraic
solutions of the Riccati equation for certain classes of diﬀerential Galois groups
can be found.

4.3.2
Liouvillian Solutions for a Diﬀerential Module
Let k be again a diﬀerential ﬁeld of characteristic 0 having a ﬁeld of constants
C ̸= k, which is algebraically closed. For a diﬀerential operator L ∈k[∂] one
wants to determine the solutions u =
y′
y of the associated Riccati equation
which are algebraic over k of a given degree d.
This amounts to producing
the monic minimal polynomial of u over k. As far as we know, the existing
algorithms, which will be described in some detail, are written in the framework
of diﬀerential operators.
It is helpful to reformulate the problem for diﬀerential modules (or ma-
trix diﬀerential equations).
The diﬀerential module M will be the dual of
the diﬀerential modules k[∂]/k[∂]L. The contravariant solution space of L is
V := {y ∈K|Ly = 0}, where K is a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for L over k. This
space can now be identiﬁed with the covariant solution space V := ker(∂, K⊗M)
of M. In the sequel we will use the canonical isomorphism K ⊗C V →K ⊗k M.
As remarked before, rational solutions of L correspond to {m ∈M|∂m = 0}
and exponential solutions of L (or equivalently rational solutions of the Riccati
equation of L) correspond to 1-dimensional submodules of M.
Lemma 4.20 Let k denote the algebraic closure of k and let ℓ⊂k be any
subﬁeld containing k.
The solutions in ℓof the Riccati equation of L are in one-to-one correspondence
with the one-dimensional ℓ-submodules of the diﬀerential module ℓ⊗k M over ℓ.
Proof.
One replaces k by ℓand M by ℓ⊗k M and regards L as an element of
ℓ[∂]. Now the statement translates into the observation made above, namely:
“The rational solutions of the Riccati equation of L are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the 1-dimensional submodules.”
2
Now we make a detailed investigation of this correspondence. Let u = y′
y ,
with y ∈V, y ̸= 0, be an algebraic solution of the Riccati equation of L, having
degree d over k. According to the proof of 4.19, the line Cy ⊂V has a G-orbit
of length d. As before, G ⊂GL(V ) denotes the diﬀerential Galois group.
Using the canonical isomorphism K ⊗C V →K ⊗k M as an identiﬁcation,
we have that Ky ⊂K ⊗k M. We ﬁx a basis e1, . . . , en of M and write y =
n
i=1 fiei with all fi ∈K. For convenience, we suppose that fn ̸= 0. One
normalizes y to ˜y :=
1
fn y = n
i=1 giei with gn = 1. The line Cy ⊂V has a
G-orbit {Cy1 = Cy, . . . , Cyd} of length d. The same holds for the 1-dimensional
subspace Ky = K ˜y. For any σ ∈G one has σ(K ˜y) = K ˜y if and only if σ˜y = ˜y.
Indeed, σ˜y = n
i=1 σ(gi)ei and σ(gn) = 1 = gn. Write {˜y = ˜y1, . . . , ˜yd} for the
G-orbit of ˜y. Clearly the coeﬃcients of ˜y1 with respect to the basis e1, . . . , en
generate a ﬁeld extension of k of degree d. The lemma implies that this ﬁeld
extension is equal to k(u).
Intermezzo on symmetric powers
For the next step we will need some information on symmetric powers of vector

126
CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS
spaces (see also [169], CH. XVI, §8 for information concerning the symmetric
powers ). Let F be any ﬁeld and A a vector space over F of dimension n with
basis e1, . . . , en. The dth symmetric power of A, denoted by symd
F A = symdA,
is the quotient of the ordinary tensor product A ⊗· · · ⊗A (of d copies of A) by
the linear subspace generated by all elements a1 ⊗· · · ⊗an −aπ(1) ⊗· · · ⊗aπ(n)
with a1, . . . , an ∈A and π ∈Sn. We will not distinguish in notation between
the elements of symdA and their preimages in A ⊗· · · ⊗A. The space symdA
has basis {ei1 ⊗· · · ⊗eid| with 1 ≤i1 ≤i2 ≤· · · ≤id ≤n}.
A vector in
symdA will be called decomposable if it has the form a1 ⊗· · · ⊗ad for certain
elements a1, . . . , ad ∈F ⊗A, where F denotes the algebraic closure of F. Here
is an important subtle point which can be explained as follows. After choosing
a basis for A over F one may identify A with the homogeneous polynomials in
n variables X1, . . . , Xn over F, having degree 1. This leads to an identiﬁcation
of symdA with the homogeneous polynomials of degree d in X1, . . . , Xn. An
irreducible homogeneous polynomial of degree d in F[X1, . . . , Xn] may factor as
a product of d linear homogeneous polynomials in F[X1, . . . , Xn]. Consider a
homogeneous H ∈F[X1, . . . , Xn] of degree 3, which factors over F as a product
of three linear terms. We may suppose that the coeﬃcient of X3
n in H is 1.
The factorization can be put in the form H = (Xn −a)(Xn −b)(Xn −c) where
a, b, c are homogeneous terms of degree 1 in F[X1, . . . , Xn−1]. The Galois group
Gal(F/F) acts on this decomposition and permutes the a, b, c. Thus we have
a (continuous) homomorphism Gal(F/F) →S3. Consider the extreme case,
where this homomorphism is surjective. The images ˜a,˜b, ˜c ∈F under a suitable
substitution Xi →ci ∈F, i = 1, . . . , n −1, are the roots of the irreducible
polynomial (Xn −˜a)(Xn −˜b)(Xn −˜c) ∈F[Xn]. Then the linear factor (Xn −a)
lies in F(˜a)[X1, . . . , Xn].
The subset of the decomposable vectors in symdA are the F-rational points
of an algebraic variety given by homogeneous equations. In terms of the chosen
basis e1, . . . , en, one writes a vector of symdA as a linear expression

i1≤···≤id
x(i1, . . . , id)ei1 ⊗· · · ⊗eid.
Let the indeterminates Xi1,...,id, with i1 ≤· · · ≤id, stand for the coordinate
functions on the vector space symdA w.r.t. the given basis. There is a ho-
mogeneous prime ideal P in the polynomial ring F[{Xi1,...,id}i1≤···≤id] such
that the set of decomposable vectors is the zero set of P.
A certain col-
lection of generators of P is known under the name Brill’s equations ([108],
pp.
120,140; [53], p.
181).
The existence of these equations follows from
the observation that the morphism P(A) × · · · × P(A) →P(symdA), given by
(Fa1, Fa2, . . . , Fad) →Fa1 ⊗· · · ⊗ad, between projective spaces has a Zariski
closed image. We will not need the precise form of Brill’s equations.
Now we return to G-orbit {˜y1 = ˜y, . . . , ˜yd} of ˜y. The element m(d, u) := ˜y1⊗· · ·⊗
˜yd of symd
K(K ⊗k M) = K ⊗ksymd
kM is invariant under G and belongs therefore
to symdM. Moreover, it is a decomposable vector, since it is a decomposable

of V (u−1A) invariant under the action of π1). It can be veriﬁed that the two
functors produce an equivalence between the two categories.
3. Regular connections, local systems and monodromy.
We suppose that X is a connected noncompact Riemann surface. Let Reg(X)
denote the category of the regular connections on X. For an object (M, ∇)
of Reg(X) one considers the sheaf L given by L(A) = {m ∈M(A)| ∇(m) =
0} for any open subset A.
The set L(A) is certainly a vector space.
Since
the connection is “locally trivial” it follows that L is locally isomorphic to the
constant sheaf Cn. Thus we found a functor from the category Reg(X) to the
category LocalSystems(X). We claim that
The functor Reg(X) →LocalSystems(X) is an equivalence.
The essential step is to produce a suitable functor in the other direction. Let
a local system L be given. Then the sheaf N := L ⊗C OX is a sheaf of OX-
modules. Locally, i.e., above some open A ⊂X, the sheaf L is isomorphic to the
constant sheaf Ce1 ⊕· · · ⊕Cen. Thus the restriction of N to A is isomorphic
to OXe1 ⊕· · · ⊕OXen. This proves that N is a vector bundle. One deﬁnes ∇
on the restriction of N to A by the formula ∇( fjej) =  dfj ⊗ej ∈ΩX ⊗N.
These local deﬁnitions glue obviously to a global ∇on N. This deﬁnes a functor
in the other direction. From this construction it is clear that the two functors
are each other’s “inverses”.
We note that the composition Reg(X) →LocalSystems(X) →Reprπ1 is in fact
the functor which associates to each regular connection its monodromy repre-
sentation. From the above it follows that this composition is also an equivalence
of categories.
4. The vector bundles on the complex sphere P
These vector bundles have been classiﬁed (by G. Birkhoﬀ[37], A. Grothendieck
[117] et al; see [215]).
For a vector bundle M (or any sheaf) on P we will
write H0(M) or H0(P, M) for its set of global sections. For any integer n one
deﬁnes the line bundle OP(n) in the following way: Put U0 = P \ {∞} and
U∞= P \ {0}. Then the restrictions of OP(n) to U0 and U∞are free and
generated by e0 and e∞. The two generators satisfy (by deﬁnition) the relation
zne0 = e∞on U0 ∩U∞.
The main result is that every vector bundle M on the complex sphere is iso-
morphic to a direct sum OP(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕OP(am). One may assume that a1 ≥
a2 ≥· · · ≥am. Although this direct sum decomposition is not unique, one can
show that the integers aj are unique. One calls the sequence a1 ≥· · · ≥am the
type of the vector bundle. We formulate some elementary properties, which are
easily veriﬁed:
(a) OP(0) = OP and OP(n) ⊗OP(m) = OP(n + m).

170
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
(b) OP(n) has only 0 as global section if n < 0.
(c) For n ≥0 the global sections of OP(n) can be written as fe0, where f runs
in the space of polynomials of degree ≤n.
The unicity of the aj above follows now from the calculation of the dimensions
of the complex vector spaces H0(OP(n) ⊗M). We note that the above M is
free if and only if all aj are zero. Other elementary properties are:
(d) ΩP is isomorphic to OP(−2).
(e) Let D =  ni[si] be a divisor on P, i.e., a formal ﬁnite sum of points of
P with integers as coeﬃcients. The degree of the divisor D is, by deﬁnition,
 ni. One deﬁnes the sheaf L(D) on P by: For any open U in P, the group
L(D)(U) consists of the meromorphic functions f on U such that the divisor of
f on U is ≥the restriction of −D to U. The sheaf L(D) is easily seen to be a
line bundle and is in fact isomorphic to OP(n), where n =  ni (i.e., the degree
of the divisor D).
(f) Let M be any vector bundle on P and D a divisor. Then M(D) is deﬁned
as L(D) ⊗M. In particular, ΩP(D) is a sheaf of diﬀerential forms on P with
prescribed zeros and poles by D. This sheaf is isomorphic to OP(−2 + deg D).
In the special case that the divisor is S = [s1] + · · · + [sm] (i.e., a number of
distinct points with “multiplicity 1”), the sheaf ΩP(S) consists of the diﬀerential
forms which have poles of order at most one at the points s1, . . . , sm. The sheaf
is isomorphic to OP(−2 +m) and for m ≥3 the dimension of its vector space of
global sections is m−1. Suppose that the points s1, . . . , sm are all diﬀerent from
∞. Then H0(Ω(S)) consists of the elements m
j=1
aj
z−sj dz with a1, . . . , aj ∈C
and  aj = 0.
5. The GAGA principle for vector bundles on P.
One can see P as the Riemann surface associated to the projective line P 1 :=
P1
C over C. Also in the algebraic context one can deﬁne line bundles, vector
bundles, connections et cetera. The “GAGA” principle gives an equivalence
between (“algebraic”) vector bundles (or more generally coherent sheaves) on
P 1 and (“analytic”) vector bundles (or analytic coherent sheaves) on P. We
will describe some of the details and refer to [258] for proofs (see also [124] for
more information concerning the notions of line bundles, vector bundles, etc. in
the algebraic context).
We begin by describing the algebraic structure on projective line P 1, see [124].
The open sets of P 1, for the Zariski topology, are the empty set and the coﬁnite
sets. The sheaf of regular functions on P 1 will be denoted by O. Thus for a
ﬁnite set S we have that O(P 1 \S) consists of the rational functions which have
their poles in S. Let M be a vector bundle on P 1 of rank m. Then for any
ﬁnite non empty set S the restriction of M to P 1 \ S is a free bundle (because
O(P 1\S) is a principal ideal domain and since H0(M|P 1\S) is projective it must

VECTOR BUNDLES AND CONNECTIONS
171
be free). In particular, M(P 1 \ S) is a free module of rank m over O(P 1 \ S).
We want to associate to M a vector bundle M an on P.
One deﬁnes M an by M an(P) = M(P 1) and for an open set U ⊂P, which has
empty intersection with a ﬁnite set S ̸= ∅, one deﬁnes M an(U) as
OP(U) ⊗O(P 1\S) M(P 1 \ S). It is not diﬃcult to show that the latter deﬁnition
is independent of the choice of S ̸= ∅. Further it can be shown that M an is a
vector bundle on P. The construction M →M an extends to coherent sheaves
on P 1 and is “functorial”.
In the other direction, we want to associate to a vector bundle N on P a vector
bundle N alg on P 1. One deﬁnes N alg as follows. N alg(P 1) = N(P) and for any
non empty ﬁnite set S one deﬁnes N alg(P 1 \ S) = ∪k≥1H0(N(k · S)). (We note
that k · S is considered as a divisor on P). If one accepts the description of the
vector bundles on P, then it is easily seen that N alg is indeed a vector bundle
on P 1. The construction N →N alg extends to (analytic) coherent sheaves and
is “functorial”.
The two functors an and alg provide an equivalence between the vector bundles
(or, more generally, analytic coherent sheaves) on P and the vector bundles (or
coherent sheaves) on P 1.
The GAGA principle holds for projective complex varieties and in particular for
the correspondence between non-singular, irreducible, projective curves over C
and compact Riemann surfaces.
2
Exercise 6.7 The sheaves OP(n)alg and O(n).
In order to describe the analytic line bundle OP(n) in terms of meromorphic
functions we identify OP(n) with the line bundle L(n.[∞]) corresponding to the
divisor n.[∞] on P. Let S = {p1, . . . , pm} be a ﬁnite set not containing ∞and
let fS = m
i=1(z −pi). Show that for U = P 1 \ S, OP(n)alg(U) consists of all
rational functions of the form g/f k
S where k ≥0 and deg g ≤n + km. Describe
OP(n)alg(U) where U = P 1 \ S and S contains the point at inﬁnity. We denote
the sheaf OP(n)alg by O(n). .
We note that the algebraic line bundle O(n) on P1 is usually deﬁned as
follows. Put U0 = P1 \ {∞} and U∞= P1 \ {0}. The restrictions of O(n) to U0
and U∞are the free sheaves OU0e0 and OU∞e∞since both rings O(U0) = C[z]
and O(U∞) = C[z−1] are unique factorization domains. The relation between
the two generators in the restriction of O(n) to U0 ∩U∞is given by zne0 = e∞.
It is obvious from this description that O(n)an is equal to OP(n).
2
We come now to the deﬁnition of a regular singular connection. Let X be a
connected Riemann surface, S a ﬁnite subset of X.
Deﬁnition 6.8 A regular singular connection on X with singular locus in S
is a pair (M, ∇) with M a vector bundle on X and ∇: M →Ω(S) ⊗M

172
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
a morphism of sheaves of groups that satisﬁes for every open U and for any
f ∈OX(U), m ∈M(U) the “Leibniz rule” ∇(fm) = df ⊗m + f∇(m).
Here S is seen as a divisor on X and Ω(S) is the sheaf of diﬀerential forms on X
having poles of at most order 1 at the points of S. The diﬀerence with the earlier
deﬁned regular connections is clearly that we allow poles of order 1 at the points
of S. We can make this explicit in the local situation: X = {c ∈C| |c| < 1},
S = {0} and M = Om
X. Then on X the map ∇d
dz : OX(X)m →z−1OX(X)m
identiﬁes with a matrix diﬀerential operator
d
dz + A, where the coeﬃcients of
A are meromorphic functions on X having a pole of order at most 1 at z = 0.
One observes that the notion of regular singular connection is rather close to
the deﬁnition of regular singular point of a matrix diﬀerential equation. One
could also introduce irregular connections by replacing S by a divisor  nj[sj]
with integers nj ≥1.
Examples 6.9 Some properties of regular singular connections.
1. The GAGA principle for regular singular connections on P.
For the sheaf of holomorphic diﬀerentials on P 1 we will use the notation Ω
and for the analogous (analytic) sheaf on P we will write Ωan.
Let an “al-
gebraic” regular singular connection on P 1 with singular locus in S be given,
this is a ∇: M →Ω(S) ⊗M, with M a vector bundle and ∇with the obvi-
ous properties. We want to associate a regular singular connection (M an, ∇)
on P with singular locus in S (see examples 6.6.3).
The only thing to ver-
ify is that the new ∇is unique and well deﬁned.
Let U be an open set of
P which has empty intersection with the ﬁnite set T ̸= ∅. We have to verify
that ∇: M an(U) →Ωan(S)(U) ⊗M an(U) is unique and well deﬁned. One
has M an(U) = OP(U) ⊗O(P 1\T ) M(P 1 \ T ) and Ω(S)an(U) ⊗OP(U) M an(U) is
canonically isomorphic to Ω(S)an(U)⊗O(P 1\T ) M(P 1 \T ). Consider an element
f ⊗m with f ∈OP(U) and m ∈M(P 1\T ). Then the only possible deﬁnition for
∇(f ⊗m) is df ⊗m+f∇(m). This expression lies in Ω(S)an(U)⊗OP(U) M an(U)
since df ∈Ωan(U) and ∇(m) ∈Ω(S)(P 1 \ T ) ⊗M(P 1 \ T ).
On the other hand, let (N, ∇) be a regular singular connection with singular
locus in S on P. We have to show that N alg inherits a regular singular con-
nection with singular locus in S. Let T be a ﬁnite non empty subset of P.
One considers N(k · T ), where k · T is seen as a divisor. It is not diﬃcult to
see that ∇on N induces a ∇: N(k · T ) →Ω(S)an ⊗N((k + 1) · T ). By con-
struction N alg(P 1 \ T ) = ∪k≥0H0(N(k · T )). Thus we ﬁnd an induced map
∇: N alg(P 1 \ T ) →Ω(S)(P 1 \ T ) ⊗N alg(P 1 \ T ). This ends the veriﬁcation of
the GAGA principle.
We introduce now three categories:
RegSing(P, S),
RegSing(P 1, S) and
RegSing(C(z), S).
The ﬁrst two categories have as objects the regular sin-
gular connections with singular locus in S for P (i.e., analytic) and for P 1
(i.e., algebraic). The third category has as objects the connections for C(z)/C
(i.e., ∇: M →C(z)dz ⊗M, see Examples 6.4) which have at most regular

VECTOR BUNDLES AND CONNECTIONS
173
singularities in the points of S (See Examples 6.4.2).
We omit the obvious
deﬁnition of morphism in the three categories. We have just shown that the
ﬁrst two categories are equivalent. There is a functor from the second category
to the third one. This functor is given as follows. Let ∇: M →Ω(S) ⊗M
be a connection on P 1 (regular singular with singular locus in S). The ﬁbre
Mη of M at the “generic point” η of P1 is deﬁned as the direct limit of all
M(U), where U runs over the collection of the co-ﬁnite subsets of P 1. One
ﬁnds a map ∇η : Mη →Ω(S)η ⊗Mη. The expression Mη is a ﬁnite dimen-
sional vector space over C(z) and Ω(S)η identiﬁes with ΩC(z)/C. Thus ∇η is
a connection for C(z)/C.
Moreover ∇η has at most regular singularities at
the points of S.
We shall refer to (Mη, ∇η) as the generic ﬁbre of (M, ∇).
We will show (Lemma 6.18) that the functor ∇→∇η from RegSing(P 1, S)
to RegSing(C(z), S) is surjective on objects. However this functor is not an
equivalence. In particular, non isomorphic ∇1, ∇2 can have isomorphic generic
ﬁbres. We will be more explicit about this in Lemma 6.18.
2. Regular singular connections on free vector bundles on P.
We consider X = P, S = {s1, . . . , sm} with m ≥2 and all si distinct from ∞.
We want to describe the regular singular connections (M, ∇) with M a free vec-
tor bundle and with singular locus in S. From M ∼= On
P it follows that the vector
space of the global sections of M has dimension n. Let e1, . . . , en be a basis. The
global sections of Ω(S) ⊗M are then the expressions n
j=1(
k
ak,j
z−sk dz) ⊗ej,
where for each j we have 
k ak,j = 0. The morphism ∇is determined by the
images ∇(ej) of the global sections of M because M is also generated, locally at
every point, by the {ej}. Furthermore we may replace ∇(ej) by ∇d
dz (ej). This
leads to the diﬀerential operator in matrix form
d
dz + m
k=1
Ak
z−sk , where the
Aj are constant square matrices of size n and satisfy m
k=1 Ak = 0. A matrix
diﬀerential operator of this form will be called Fuchsian diﬀerential equation
with singular locus in S .
For S = {s1, . . . , sm−1, ∞} one ﬁnds in a similar way an associated matrix
diﬀerential equation
d
dz + m−1
k=1
Ak
z−sk (in this case there is no condition on the
sum of the matrices Ak). We note that the notion of a Fuchsian system with
singular locus in S is, since it is deﬁned by means of a connection, invariant
under automorphisms of the complex sphere.
3. A construction with regular singular connections.
Let (M, ∇) be a regular singular connection with singular locus in S. For a point
s ∈S we will deﬁne a new vector bundle M(−s) ⊂M. Let t be a local parameter
at the point s. Then for U not containing s one deﬁnes M(−s)(U) = M(U).
If U is a small enough neighbourhood of s then M(−s)(U) = tM(U) ⊂M(U).
One can also deﬁne a vector bundle M(s). This bundle can be made explicit
by M(s)(U) = M(U) if s ̸∈U and M(s)(U) = t−1M(U) for a small enough
neighbourhood U of s. We claim that the vector bundles M(−s) and M(s)
inherit from M a regular singular connection. For an open U which does not
contain s, one has M(s)(U) = M(−s)(U) = M(U) and we deﬁne the ∇’s

174
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
for M(s) and M(−s) to coincide with the one for M.
For a small enough
neighbourhood U of s one deﬁnes the new ∇’s by ∇(t−1m) = −dt
t ⊗t−1m +
t−1∇(m) (for M(s) and m a section of M) and ∇(tm) =
dt
t ⊗tm + t∇(m)
(for M(−s)). This is well deﬁned since dt
t is a section of Ω(S). The ∇’s on
M(−s) ⊂M ⊂M(s) are restrictions of each other.
More generally, one can consider any divisor D with support in S, i.e., D =
 mj[sj] for some integers mj. A regular singular connection on M induces a
“canonical” regular singular connection on M(D).
Exercise 6.10 Let (M, ∇) be a regular singular connection and let D be a
divisor with support in S. Show that the induced regular singular connection
on M(D) has the same generic ﬁbre as (M, ∇) (see example 6.9.1).
2
4. The historically earlier notion of Fuchsian linear operator L of degree n and
with singular locus in S is deﬁned in a rather diﬀerent way. For the case S =
{s1, . . . , sm−1, ∞} this reads as follows. Let L = ∂n +a1∂n−1+· · ·+an−1∂+an,
where ∂=
d
dz and the aj ∈C(z). One requires further that the only poles
of the rational functions aj are in S and that each singularity in S is “regular
singular”. The latter condition is that the associated matrix diﬀerential equation
can locally at the points of S be transformed into a matrix diﬀerential equation
with a pole of at most order 1. We will prove that:
Lemma 6.11 L is a Fuchsian scalar diﬀerential equation with singular locus
in S if and only if the aj have the form
bj
(z−s1)j···(z−sm−1)j with bj polynomials
of degrees ≤j(m −1) −j.
Proof.
We ﬁrst examine the order of each aj, say at z = si.
For nota-
tional convenience we suppose that si = 0. We consider M = znL = zn∂n +
za1zn−1∂n−1 + · · · + zn−1an−1z∂+ znan which can be written as δn + c1δn−1 +
· · · + cn for certain cj ∈C(z). From the last expression one easily ﬁnds the
Newton polygon at the point z = 0. The operator (or the corresponding matrix
diﬀerential equation) is regular singular at z = 0 if and only if the Newton
polygon has only slope 0. The last condition is equivalent to ord0(cj) ≥0 for all
j. From the obvious formula zm∂m = (δ −m)(δ −m + 1) · · · (δ −1)δ it follows
that the condition on the cj is equivalent to ord0(aj) ≥−j for all j. A similar
calculation at z = ∞ﬁnishes the proof.
2
We note that a scalar operator L, as in the statement, need not be singular
at all the points of S.
At some of the points of S the equation may have
n independent local solutions. In that case the point is sometimes called an
apparent singularity.
For example, the operator ∂2 −
2
z2−2 is Fuchsian with
singular locus in {
√
2, −
√
2, ∞}. The point at inﬁnity turns out to be regular.
The automorphisms φ of the complex sphere have the form φ(z) = az+b
cz+d with

a b
c d

∈PSL2(C). We extend this automorphism φ of C(z) to the automorphism,

FUCHSIAN EQUATIONS
175
again denoted by φ, of C(z)[∂] by φ(∂) =
1
(cz+d)2 ∂. Suppose that (the monic)
L ∈C(z)[∂] is a Fuchsian operator with singular locus in S. Then one can
show that φ(L) = fM with f ∈C(z)∗and M a monic Fuchsian operator with
singular locus in φ(S).
Thus the notion of Fuchsian scalar operator is also
“invariant” under automorphisms of P.
2
6.3
Fuchsian Equations
The comparison between scalar Fuchsian equations and Fuchsian equations in
matrix form is far from trivial. The next two sections deal with two results
which are also present in [9]. In a later section we will return to this theme.
6.3.1
From Scalar Fuchsian to Matrix Fuchsian
C will denote an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0. Let an nth order
monic Fuchsian operator L ∈C(z)[∂] (where ∂=
d
dz) with singular locus in S
be given. We want to show that there is a Fuchsian matrix equation of order
n with singular locus in S, having a cyclic vector e, such that the minimal
monic operator M ∈C(z)[∂] with Me = 0 coincides with L. This statement
seems to be “classical”. However, the only proof that we know of is the one
of ([9], Theorem 7.2.1). We present here a proof which is algebraic and even
algorithmic.
If S consists of one point then we may, after an automorphism of P1, suppose
that S = {∞}. The Fuchsian operator L can only be ∂n and the statement is
trivial. If S consists of two elements then we may suppose that S = {0, ∞}. Let
us use the operator δ = z∂. Then znL can be rewritten as operator in δ and it
has the form δn + a1δn−1 + · · ·+ an with all ai ∈C. Let V be an n-dimensional
vector space over C with basis e1, . . . , en. Deﬁne the linear map B on V by
B(ei) = ei+1 for i = 1, . . . , n −1 and Ben = −anen −an−1en−1 −· · · −a1e1.
Then the matrix equation δ + B (or the matrix equation ∂+ B
z ) is Fuchsian
and the minimal monic operator M with Me1 = 0 is equal to L. For a singular
locus S with cardinality > 2 we may suppose that S is equal to 0, s1, . . . , sk, ∞.
Theorem 6.12 Let L ∈C(z)[∂] be a monic Fuchsian operator with singular
locus in S = {0, s1, . . . , sk, ∞}. There are constant matrices B0, . . . , Bk
with B0 =

Proof.
Write D = (z −s1) · · · (z −sk) and F = zD. Consider the diﬀerential
operator ∆= F d
dz. One can rewrite F nL as a diﬀerential operator in ∆. It
will have the form ˜L := ∆n + A1∆n−1 + · · · + An−1∆+ An, where the Ai are
polynomials with degrees ≤k.i. Conversely, an operator of the form ˜L in ∆can
be transformed into a Fuchsian operator in ∂with singular locus in S. Likewise,
we multiply the matrix operator of the statement on the left hand side by F
and ﬁnd a matrix operator of the form

convenience, we write en+1 = 0. For the computation of the minimal monic

Mi = (∆−Bi,i −(i −1)zD′).

One sees that the Li are constructed such that Lie1 = Diei+1. In particular,
e1 is a cyclic element for the matrix diﬀerential operator and Ln is the minimal
monic operator in C(z)[∆] with Lne1 = 0. Since Ln actually lies in C[z][∆]
and the coeﬃcients of Ln w.r.t. ∆satisfy the correct bound on the degrees, it
follows that Ln gives rise to a Fuchsian scalar operator with the singular locus
in S.
In order to prove that we can produce, by varying the coeﬃcients of the matrices
B0, B1, . . . , Bk, any given element T := ∆n + A1∆n−1 + · · · + An−1∆+ An ∈
C[z][∆] with the degree of each Ai less than or equal to k.i, we have to analyse
the formula for Ln a bit further. We start by giving some explicit formulas:
L1 = M1 and L2 = M2M1 −FB2,1 and
L3 = M3M2M1 −(M3FB2,1 + FB3,2M1) −FDB3,1

L4 = M4M3M2M1 −(M4M3FB2,1 + M4FB3,2M1 + FB4,3M2M1)
−(M4FDB3,1 + FDB4,2M1) −FD2B4,1 + FB4,3FB2,1.
By induction one derives the following formula for Ln:

Mn · · · Mi+2FBi+1,iMi−1 · · · M1

i=1
Mn · · · Mi+4FD2Bi+3,iMi−1 · · · M1
−· · · · · · −MnFDn−3Bn−1,1 −FDn−2Bn,1 + overﬂow terms.
The terms in this formula are polynomials of degrees n, n −2, n −3, . . . , 1, 0 in
∆. By an “overﬂow term ” we mean a product of, say n −l of the Mi’s and
involving two or more terms Bx,y with x −y ≤l −2.
We will solve the equation Ln = T stepwise by solving modulo F, modulo
FD, ..., modulo FDn−1. At the jth step we will determine the polynomials
Bj+i−1,i, 1 ≤i ≤n −j + 1. i.e., the polynomials on the jth diagonal. After
the last step, one actually has the equality Ln = T since the coeﬃcients of
Ln −T are polynomials of degree ≤k.n and the degree of FDn−1 is 1 + kn.
We note further that the left ideal I in C[z][∆] generated by the element a :=
zn0(z −s1)n1 · · · (z −sk)nk (for any n0, . . . , nk) is in fact a two sided ideal and
thus we can work modulo I in the usual manner. We note further that Mi
almost commutes with a in the sense that Mia = a(Mi + F a′
a ) and F a′
a ∈C[z].
The ﬁrst equation that we want to solve is Ln ≡T modulo F. This is the
same as Mn · · · M1 ≡T modulo F and again the same as Mn · · · M1 ≡T mod-
ulo each of the two sided ideals (z), (z −s1), . . . , (z −sk) in C[z][∆].
This
is again equivalent to the polynomials n
i=1(∆−Bi,i(0)) and, for each s ∈
{s1, . . . , sk}, the n
i=1(∆−Bi,i(s) −sD′(s)) are prescribed as elements of
C[∆]. For each i, this means that there are only ﬁnitely many possibilities for
Bi,1,(0), Bi,i(s1), . . . , Bi,i(sk) and for each choice of these elements Bi,i can be
(uniquely) determined by interpolation. Therefore, there are ﬁnitely many possi-
bilities for the polynomials B1,1, . . . , Bn,n. In particular, for any s ∈{s1, . . . , sk}
one is allowed to permute the numbers Bn,n(s) + (n −1)sD′(s), . . . , B2,2(s) +
sD′(s), B1,1(s).
After a suitable permutation for each s ∈{s1, . . . , sk}, the
following “technical assumption” is satisﬁed: For i > j, the diﬀerence
Bi,i(s) + (i −1)sD′(s)
sD′(s)
−Bj,j(s) + (j −1)sD′(s)
sD′(s)

178
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
is not a strictly positive integer. For example, we could permute the Bi,i so that
Re(Bi,i(s)) ≤Re(Bj,j(s)) for i > j.
In the second step, we have to consider the equation Ln ≡T modulo FD. This
can also be written as: produce polynomials Bi+1,i of degrees ≤k −1 such that
the linear combination
(F)−1(
n−1

is modulo D a prescribed element Cn−2∆n−2 + Cn−3∆n−3 + · · · + C1∆+ C0 ∈
C[z][∆] with the degrees of the Ci bounded by k.i for all i.
Again we can
split this problem into an equivalence modulo (z −s) for s ∈{s1, . . . , sk}. A
suﬃcient condition for solving this problem (again using interpolation) is that
for any such s the polynomials F −1Mn · · · Mi+2FMi−1 · · · M1 modulo (z −s) in
C[∆] (for i = 1, . . . , n −1) are linearly independent. This will follow from our
“technical assumption”, as we will verify.
Write M ∗
i for F −1MiF and write M ∗
i (s), Mi(s) ∈C[∆] for M ∗
i and Mi modulo
(z −s). The zero of M ∗
i (s) is Bi,i(s) + (i −1)sD′(s) −sD′(s) and the zero of
Mi(s) is Bi,i(s) + (i −1)sD′(s). We calculate step by step the linear space V
generated by the n−1 polynomials of degree n−2. The collection of polynomials
contains M ∗
n(s) · · · M ∗
4 (s)M ∗
3 (s) and M ∗
n(s) · · · M ∗
4 (s)M1(s). Since M ∗
3 (s) and
M1(s) have no common zero, we conclude that V contains M ∗
n(s) · · · M ∗
4 (s)P1,
where P1 is any polynomial of degree ≤1. Further M ∗
n(s) · · · M ∗
5 (s)M2(s)M1(s)
belongs to the collection. Since M2(s)M1(s) and M ∗
4 (s) have no common zero we
conclude that V contains all polynomials of the form M ∗
n(s) · · · M ∗
5 (s)P2, where
P2 is any polynomial of degree ≤2. By induction one ﬁnds that V consists of
all polynomials of degree ≤n −2. Thus we can solve Ln ≡T modulo FD in a
unique way (after the choice made in the ﬁrst step). This ends the second step.
The further steps, i.e., solving Ln ≡T modulo FDj for j = 2, . . . , n are carried
out in a similar way. In each step we ﬁnd a unique solution.

6.3.2
A Criterion for a Scalar Fuchsian Equation
In this section and Section 6.5, we shall consider regular singular connections
(M, ∇) with singular locus S whose generic ﬁbres (Mη, ∇η) are irreducible
connections for C(z)/C. We shall refer to such connections as irreducible regular
singular connections . The connection (Mη, ∇η) furthermore gives rise to a
diﬀerential module. In the next proposition, we give a criterion for this module
to have a cyclic vector with minimal monic annihilating operator that is Fuchsian
with singular locus S.
Proposition 6.13 Let ∇: M →Ω(S) ⊗M be an irreducible regular singular
connection of rank n on P1 with singular locus in S. Put k = #S −2. Suppose

FUCHSIAN EQUATIONS
179
that the type of M is b, b−k, b−2k, . . ., b−(n−1)k. Then there is an equivalent
scalar Fuchsian equation of order n having singular locus S.
Proof.
For any s ∈S, M and M(−b[s]) have the same generic ﬁbre. There-
fore, after replacing M by M(−b[s]) for some s ∈S, we may assume b = 0.
If k = 0, then M is a free vector bundle. We may assume that S = {0, ∞}.
As in Example 6.9.2, we see that this leads to a diﬀerential equation of the
form
d
dz −A
z where A ∈Mn(C). Since the connection is irreducible, the asso-
ciated diﬀerential module M is also irreducible. This implies that A can have
no invariant subspaces and so n = 1. The operator
d
dz −a
z , a ∈C is clearly
Fuchsian.
We now suppose that k > 0 and S = {0, ∞, s1, . . . , sk}. As before, we write
L(D) for the line bundle of the functions f with divisor ≥−D. We may identify
M with the subbundle of Oe1 ⊕· · · ⊕Oen given as
Oe1 ⊕L(−k[∞])e2 ⊕L(−2k[∞])e3 ⊕· · · ⊕L(−(n −1)k[∞])en.
Clearly e1 is a basis of H0(M). We will show that the minimal monic diﬀerential
operator L ∈C(z)[∂] satisfying Le1 = 0 has order n and is Fuchsian. Actually,
we will consider the diﬀerential operator ∆= z(z −s1) · · · (z −sk) d
dz and show
that the minimal monic operator N ∈C(z)[∆] such that Ne1 = 0 has degree
n and its coeﬃcients are polynomials with degrees bounded by k · i. (See the
proof of Theorem 6.12).
There is an obvious isomorphism Ω(S) →L(k · [∞]), which sends
dz
z
to
(z −s1) · · · (z −sk). Deﬁne ∆: M →L(k · [∞]) ⊗M as the composition of
∇: M →Ω(S) ⊗M and the isomorphism Ω(S) ⊗M →L(k · [∞]) ⊗M. One
can extend ∆to a map ∆: L(ik · [∞]) ⊗M →L((i + 1)k · [∞]) ⊗M. One has
∆(fm) = z(z −s1) · · · (z −sk) df
dzm + f∆(m) for a function f and a section m
of M.
We observe that ∆(e1) is a global section of L(k · [∞]) ⊗M and has therefore
the form ae1 + be2 with a a polynomial of degree ≤k and b a constant. The
constant b is non zero, since the connection is irreducible. One changes the
original e1, e2, . . . by replacing e2 by ae1 +be2 and keeping the other ej’s. After
this change ∆(e1) = e2. Similarly, ∆e2 is a global section of L(2k·[∞])⊗M and
has therefore the form ce1+de2+ee3 with c, d, e polynomials of degrees ≤2k, k, 0.
The constant e is not zero since the connection is irreducible. One changes the
element e3 into ce1 + de2 + ee3 and keeps the other ej’s. After this change, one
has ∆e2 = e3. Continuing in this way one ﬁnds a new elements e1, e2, . . . , en
such that M is the subbundle of Oe1 ⊕· · · ⊕Oen, given as before, and such
that ∆(ei) = ei+1 for i = 1, . . . , n −1. The ﬁnal ∆(en) is a global section of
L(nk ·[∞])⊗M and can therefore be written as ane1 +an−1e2 +· · ·+a1en with
ai a polynomial of degree ≤ki. Then N := ∆n −a1∆n−1 −· · · −an−1∆−an
is the monic polynomial of minimal degree with Ne1 = 0.

CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
We note that Proposition 6.13 and its converse, Proposition 6.14, are present
or deducible from Bolibruch’s work (Theorem 4.4.1 and Corollary 4.4.1 of [43],
see also Theorems 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of [9]).
Proposition 6.14 Let L be a scalar Fuchsian equation with singular locus S.
Then there is an equivalent connection (M, ∇) with singular locus S and of type
0, −k, −2k, . . ., −(n −1)k.
Proof.
We may suppose S = {0, s1, . . . , sk, ∞} and we may replace L by a
monic operator M ∈C[z][∆], M = ∆n −a1∆n−1 −· · · −an−1∆−an with ai
polynomials of degrees ≤ki. For the vector bundle M one takes the subbundle
of Oe1 ⊕· · · ⊕Oen given as
Oe1 ⊕L(−k · [∞])e2 ⊕L(−2k · [∞])e3 ⊕· · · ⊕L(−(n −1) · [∞])en.
One deﬁnes ∆: M →L(k · [∞]) ⊗M by ∆(ei) = ei+1 for i = 1, . . . , n −1 and
∆(en) = ane1 + an−1e2 + · · · + a1en. The deﬁnition of ∇on M follows from
this and the type of M is 0, −k, . . . , −(n −1)k as required.

6.4
The Riemann-Hilbert Problem, Weak Form
We ﬁx a ﬁnite subset S on the complex sphere P and a base point b ̸∈S for
the fundamental group π1 of P \ S. An object M of RegSing(C(z), S) (see part
1. of 6.9) is a connection ∇: M →Ω⊗M, where M is a ﬁnite dimensional
vector space over C(z), such that the singularities of the connection are regular
singular and lie in S. Let V denote the local solution space of (M, ∇) at the point
b. The monodromy of the connection is a homomorphism π1 →GL(V ). Let
Reprπ1 denote the category of the ﬁnite dimensional complex representations of
π1. Then we have attached to (M, ∇) an object of Reprπ1. This extends in fact
to a functor M : RegSing(C(z), S) →Reprπ1. A solution of the “weak form”
of the Riemann-Hilbert problem is given in the following (see Appendix B for
facts concerning Tannakian categories).
Theorem 6.15 The functor M : RegSing(C(z), S) →Reprπ1 is an equivalence
of categories. This functor respects all “constructions of linear algebra” and is,
in particular, an equivalence of Tannakian categories.
Proof.
It is easy to see that M respects all constructions of linear algebra. We
will ﬁrst show that for two objects M1, M2 the C-linear map Hom(M1, M2) →
Hom(M(M1), M(M2)) is an isomorphism. In proving this, it suﬃces to take
M1 = 1, i.e., the trivial connection of dimension 1. Then Hom(1, M2) consists
of the elements m2 ∈M2 with ∇(m2) = 0. The elements of Hom(1, M(M2))
are the vectors v in the solution space of M2 at b, which are invariant under
the monodromy of M2. Such an element v extends to all of P \ S. Since the

THE RIEMANN-HILBERT PROBLEM IN WEAK FORM
181
connection has regular singularities v is bounded at each point s in S by a power
of the absolute value of a local parameter at s. Thus v extends in a meromorphic
way to all of P and is therefore an element of M2 satisfying ∇(v) = 0. This
proves that the map under consideration is bijective.
The ﬁnal and more diﬃcult part of the proof consists of producing for a given
representation ρ : π1 →GLn(C) an object (M, ∇) of RegSing(C(z), S) such
that its monodromy representation is isomorphic to ρ. From Example 6.6.3 the
existence of a regular connection (N, ∇) on P\S with monodromy representation
ρ follows. The next step that one has to do, is to extend N and ∇to a regular
singular connection on P. This is done by a local calculation.
Consider a point s ∈S. For notational convenience we suppose that s = 0. Put
Y ∗:= {z ∈C| 0 < |z| < ϵ}. Let V be the solution space of (N, ∇) at the point
ϵ/2. The circle through ϵ/2 around 0 induces a monodromy map B ∈GL(V ).
We choose now a linear map A : V →V such that e2πiA = B and deﬁne the
regular singular connection (Ns, ∇s) on Y := {z ∈C| |z| < ϵ} by the formulas:
Ns = OY ⊗V and ∇s(f ⊗v) = df ⊗v + z−1 ⊗A(v). The restriction of (Ns, ∇s)
to Y ∗= Y \{0} has local monodromy e2πiA. From part (3) of 6.6 it follows that
the restriction of the connections (Ns, ∇s) and (N, ∇) to Y ∗are isomorphic. We
choose an isomorphism and use this to glue the connections (N, ∇) and (Ns, ∇s)
to a regular singular connection on (P \ S) ∪{s}. This can be done for every
point s ∈S and we arrive at a regular singular connection (M, ∇) on P with
singular locus in S and with the prescribed monodromy representation ρ. From
part 1. of Example 6.9 we know that (M, ∇) comes from an algebraic regular
singular connection on P 1 with singular locus in S. The generic ﬁbre of this
algebraic connection is the object of RegSing(C(z), S) which has the required
monodromy representation ρ.
2
We note that the contents of the theorem is “analytic”. Moreover the proof of
the existence of a regular connection for (C(z), S) with prescribed monodromy
depends on the GAGA principle and is not constructive. Further one observes
that the regular singular connection for (P, S) is not unique, since we have
chosen matrices A with e2πiA = B and we have chosen local isomorphisms
for the glueing.
The Riemann-Hilbert problem in “strong form” requires a
regular singular connection for (P, S) (or for (P 1, S)) such that the vector bundle
in question is free. Given a weak solution for the Riemann-Hilbert problem,
the investigation concerning the existence of a strong solution is then a purely
algebraic problem.
In [9], [41], and [44], Bolibruch has constructed counterexamples to the strong
Riemann-Hilbert problem. He also gave a positive solution for the strong prob-
lem in the case that the representation is irreducible [9], [42] (see also the work
of Kostov [162]). We will give an algebraic version of this proof in the next
section.

182
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
6.5
Irreducible Connections
Let C denote an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and let (M, ∇)
denote a regular singular connection for C(z)/C with singular locus in S ⊂P 1,
where P 1 is the projective line over C.
In this section we will show that,
under the assumption that (M, ∇) is irreducible, there exists a regular singular
connection (M, ∇) on P 1, such that:
(a) The generic ﬁbre of (M, ∇) is (M, ∇).
(b) The singular locus of (M, ∇) is contained in S.
(c) The vector bundle M is free.
Combining this result with Theorem 6.15 one obtains a solution of the Riemann-
Hilbert problem in the strong sense for irreducible representations of the funda-
mental group of P \ S. The proof that we give here relies on unpublished notes
of O. Gabber and is referred to in the Bourbaki talk of A. Beauville [26]. We
thank O. Gabber for making these notes available to us.
We have to do some preparations and to introduce some notations. The sheaf of
regular functions on P 1 is denoted by O. By O(n) we denote the line bundle of
degree n on P 1 (see Exercise 6.7). For any point p ∈P 1, one considers the stalk
Op of O at p. This is a discrete valuation ring lying in C(z). Its completion is
denoted by Op and the ﬁeld of fractions of Op will be denoted by 
C(z)p. This
ﬁeld is the completion of C(z) with respect to the valuation ring Op. A lattice
in a ﬁnite dimensional vector space V over 
C(z)p is a free Op-submodule of V
with rank equal to the dimension of V . The following lemma describes a vector
bundle on P 1 in terms of a basis of its generic ﬁbre and lattices at ﬁnitely many
points. We will use elementary properties of coherent sheaves and refer to [124]
for the relevant facts.
Lemma 6.16 Let M denote a vector space over C(z) with a basis e1, . . . en.
Let U be a non trivial open subset of P 1 and for each p ̸∈U let Λp be a lattice
of 
C(z)p ⊗M. Then there exists a unique vector bundle M on P 1 such that:
(a) For every open V ⊂P 1 one has M(V ) ⊂M.
(b) M(U) is equal to O(U)e1 + · · · + O(U)en ⊂M.
(c) For every p ̸∈U, the completion 
Mp := Op ⊗Mp coincides with Λp.
Proof.
For p ∈P 1\U we put Sp := Ope1+· · ·+ Open. Let for every p ∈P 1\U
an integer Ap be given. Consider ﬁrst the special case where each Λp = tAp
p Sp,
where tp denotes a local coordinate at p. Put N = Oe1 + · · · + Oen and let A
be the divisor  Ap[p] (the sum extended over the p ∈P 1 \ U). Then clearly
the vector bundle N(−A) = L(−A) ⊗N solves the problem.
In the general case, there are integers Ap, Bp such that tAp
p Sp ⊂Λp ⊂tBp
p Sp

IRREDUCIBLE CONNECTIONS
183
holds. Let B be the divisor  Bp[p]. Then N(−A) ⊂N(−B) are both vector
bundles on P 1. Consider the surjective morphism of coherent sheaves N(−B)
q→
N(−B)/N(−A). The second sheaf has support in P 1 \ U and can be written
as a skyscraper sheaf ⊕ptBp
p Sp/tAp
p Sp (see Example C.2(7) and [124]).
This
skyscraper sheaf has the coherent subsheaf T := 
p Λp/tAp
p Sp. Deﬁne now M
as the preimage under q of T . From the exact sequence 0 →N(−A) →M →
T →0 one easily deduces that M has the required properties (see [124], Ch. II.5
for the relevant facts about coherent sheaves). An alternative way of describing
M is that the set M(V ), for any open V ̸= ∅, consists of the elements m ∈M
such that for p ∈U ∩V one has m ∈Ope1 + · · · + Open and for p ∈V, p ̸∈U
one has m ∈Λp ⊂
C(z)p ⊗M. This shows the unicity of M.
2
Let M be a vector bundle on P 1. According to Grothendieck’s classiﬁcation
(and the GAGA principle), M is equal to a direct sum O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(an)
with integers a1 ≥· · · ≥an. This decomposition is not unique. However there
is a canonical ﬁltration by subbundles F 1 ⊂F 2 ⊂. . . .
One deﬁnes F 1 :=
O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(as1), where s1 is the last integer with as1 = a1. The subbundle
is unique, since O(−a1) ⊗F 1 is the subbundle of O(−a1) ⊗M generated by
the global sections H0(P 1, O(−a1) ⊗M). In case not all aj are equal to a1
one deﬁnes s2 to be the last integer with as2 = as1+1. The term F 2, deﬁned
as the direct sum O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(as2), is again uniquely deﬁned since it is
the subbundle generated by the global sections of O(−as2) ⊗M. The other
possible F i ⊂M are deﬁned in a similar way. We will also need the notion
of the defect of the vector bundle M, which we deﬁne as (a1 −ai). In later
parts of the proof we want to change a given vector bundle by changing the
data of Lemma 6.16. The goal is to obtain a vector bundle with defect zero,
i.e., a1 = a2 = · · · = an. In the next lemma the eﬀect of a small local change
on the type of the vector bundle is given.
Lemma 6.17 Let M, U, Λp, M be as in Lemma 6.16. Let the type of M be
given by the integers a1 ≥· · · ≥an and let F 1 ⊂F 2 ⊂. . . denote the canonical
ﬁltration of M. We consider a p0 ∈P 1\U with local parameter t and a non zero
vector v ∈V := Λp0/tΛp0. Deﬁne a new lattice ˜Λp0 := Opt−1˜v + Λp0, where
˜v ∈Λp0 has image v ∈V . Let
˜
M denote the vector bundle on P 1 given by
Lemma 6.16 using the same data as M with the exception that Λp0 is replaced
by ˜Λp0.
The vector space V has an induced ﬁltration F 1(V ) ⊂F 2(V ) ⊂. . . . Let i be
the ﬁrst integer such that v ∈F i(V ) and let j be the smallest integer such that
O(aj) is present in F i \ F i−1. Then the type of
˜
M is obtained from the type of
M by replacing aj by aj + 1.
Proof.
Choose a direct sum decomposition M = O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(an). Then
F i−1 = O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(aj−1) and F i = O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(ak), where a1 ≥
· · · ≥aj−1 > aj = · · · = ak (and ak > ak+1 if k < n). For ˜v we may choose

184
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
an element in F i
p0 which does not lie in F i−1
p0 . After changing the direct sum
decomposition of F i we can arrange that ˜v ∈O(aj)p0. Then ˜
M is obtained from
M by performing only a change to the direct summand O(aj) of M. In this
change the line bundle O(aj) is replaced by L(p0) ⊗O(aj). The latter bundle
is isomorphic to O(aj + 1).
2
We focus now on a regular singular connection (M, ∇) for C(z)/C with
singular locus in S. For every point p ∈P 1 we choose a local parameter tp. The
induced connection on 
Mp := 
C(z)p⊗M has the form ∇: 
Mp →
C(z)pdtp⊗
Mp.
For p ̸∈S, there exists a basis e1, . . . , en of 
Mp over 
C(z)p with ∇(ej) = 0 for
all j. From this it follows that Λp := Ope1 + · · · + Open is the unique lattice
such that ∇: Λp →Opdtp ⊗Λp. For p ∈S there is a basis e1, . . . , en of 
Mp over

C(z)p such that the vector space V = Ce1 ⊕· · ·⊕Cen satisﬁes ∇(V ) ⊂dtp
tp ⊗V .
Then Λp := Op ⊗V ⊂
Mp is a lattice satisfying ∇(Λp) ⊂dtp
tp ⊗Λp. We observe
that there are many lattices in 
Mp having the same property. We want now to
extend Lemma 6.16 and Lemma 6.17 to the case of connections.
Lemma 6.18 1. Let (M, ∇) be a regular singular connection for C(z)/C with
singular locus in S. For every s ∈S we choose a local parameter ts. For every
s ∈S let Λs ⊂
Ms be a lattice which satisﬁes ∇(Λs) ⊂dts
ts ⊗Λs. Then there
is a unique regular singular connection (M, ∇) on P 1 with singular locus in S
such that:
(a) For every open V ⊂P 1, one has M(V ) ⊂M.
(b) The generic ﬁbre of (M, ∇) is (M, ∇).
(c) 
Ms := Os ⊗Ms coincides with Λs for all s ∈S.

Let (M, ∇) be any connection with singular locus in S and generic ﬁbre
isomorphic to (M, ∇). After identiﬁcation of the generic ﬁbre of M with M,
the 
Ms are lattices Λs for 
Ms satisfying ∇(Λs) ⊂dts
ts ⊗Λs. Thus (M, ∇) is the
unique connection of part 1.
Proof.
We start with a basis e1, . . . , en for the C(z)-vector space M and choose
a non empty open U ⊂P 1 \{∞} such that ∇(ej) ∈dz ⊗O(U)e1 +· · ·+O(U)en.
For a point p ̸∈U and p ̸∈S we deﬁne the lattice Λp to be the unique lattice
with ∇(Λp) ⊂dtp ⊗Λp (where tp is again a local parameter). Lemma 6.16
produces a unique M with these data. The veriﬁcation that the obvious ∇on
M has the property ∇: M →Ω(S) ⊗M can be done locally for every point p.
In fact, it suﬃces to prove that ∇maps 
Mp into dtp ⊗
Mp for p ̸∈S and into
dtp
tp ⊗
Mp for p ∈S. The data which deﬁne M satisfy these properties. Part 2.
of the lemma is an obvious consequence of part 1.

IRREDUCIBLE CONNECTIONS

Lemma 6.19 We will use the notations of Lemma 6.18 and Lemma 6.17.
Choose an s ∈S.
The map ∇: Λs →
dts
ts ⊗Λs induces a C-linear map
δs : Λs/tsΛs →dts
ts ⊗Λs/tsΛs →Λs/tsΛs, which does not depend on the choice
of ts.
Let v ∈Λs/tsΛs be an eigenvector for δs.
Deﬁne ˜Λs and
˜
M as in
Lemma 6.17. Then:
(a) ∇maps ˜Λs into dts
ts ⊗˜Λs.
(b) The connection on M extends uniquely to
˜
M.
(c) Let ˜Λs have an Os-basis e1, . . . , en such that ∇(ei) = dts
ts ⊗ ai,jej with
ai,j ∈tN
s Os for i ̸= j and some N ≥1. Suppose that the above v is equal to the
image of ek in Λs/tsΛs. Then ˜Λs has the Os-basis f1, f2, . . . , fn with fk = t−1ek
and fl = el for l ̸= k. Deﬁne the matrix (bi,j) by ∇(fi) = dts
ts ⊗ bi,jfj. Then
bk,k = ak,k −1 and bl,l = al,l for l ̸= k. Further bi,j ∈tN−1 Os for i ̸= j.
Proof.
(a) Choose a representative ˜v ∈Λs of v. Then ∇(˜v) ∈dts
ts ⊗(a˜v+tsΛs)
for some a ∈C. Thus ∇(t−1
s ) ∈dts
ts ⊗(−t−1
s ˜v + at−1
s ˜v + Λs). This shows that
˜Λs = Ost−1
s ˜v + Λs has the property ∇(˜Λs) ⊂dts
ts ⊗˜Λs. (b) follows from (a) and
Lemma 6.18. A straightforward calculation shows (c).
2
Lemma 6.20 Let (Z, ∇) be a regular singular connection for C((z))/C and let
N > 0 be an integer. There exists an C[[z]]-lattice Λ with basis e1, . . . , en such
that ∇(ei) = dz
z ⊗ ai,jej with all ai,j ∈C[[z]] and ai,j ∈zNC[[z]] for i ̸= j.
Proof.
Write δ for the map ∇z d
dz : Z →Z. According to the formal classi-
ﬁcation of regular singular diﬀerential equations it follows that Z has a basis
f1, . . . , fn such that δ(fi) =  ci,jfj for a matrix (ci,j) with coeﬃcients in C. If
this matrix happens to be diagonizable, then one can choose a basis e1, . . . , en
such that ∇(ei) = dz
z ⊗ciei with all ci ∈C. In the general case the Jordan
normal form has one or several blocks of dimension > 1. It suﬃces to consider
the case of one Jordan block, i.e., δ(f1) = cf1, δ(f2) = cf2 + f1, . . . , δ(fn) =
cfn + fn−1. One deﬁnes e1 = f1, e2 = tNf2, e3 = t2Nf3, . . . . One calculates
that δ(e1) = ce1, δ(e2) = (c + N)e2 + tNe1, δ(e3) = (c + 2N)e3 + tNe2, . . . .
Thus the basis e1, . . . , en has the required properties.
2
Proposition 6.21 Let (M, ∇) be an irreducible regular singular connection on
P 1 with singular locus in S. Let a1 ≥a2 ≥· · · ≥an denote the type of M.
Then aj−1 −aj ≤(−2 + #S) for all j ≥1. In particular, the defect of M is
≤n(n−1)
2
· (−2 + #S).
Proof.
M is written as a direct sum of the line bundles O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(an).
Suppose that aj−1 > aj and put F = O(a1) ⊕· · · ⊕O(aj−1). Then F is one of
the canonical subbundles of M. One considers the morphism
L : F ⊂M
∇
→Ω(S) ⊗M →Ω(S) ⊗M/F.

186
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
The morphism L is non zero since (M, ∇) is irreducible. Further L is an O-linear
map and can therefore be considered as a nonzero global section of the vector
bundle F ∗⊗Ω(S) ⊗M/F. This vector bundle has a direct sum decomposition
isomorphic to 
k<j, l≥j O(−ak) ⊗O(−2 + #S) ⊗O(al). Since L ̸= 0, we must
have that some −ak−2+#S+al ≥0. This is equivalent to aj−1−aj ≤−2+#S.
2
Theorem 6.22 Let (M, ∇) be an irreducible regular singular connection over
C(z) with singular locus contained in S. There exists a regular singular connec-
tion (M, ∇) on P 1, such that:
(a) The generic ﬁbre of (M, ∇) is (M, ∇).
(b) The singular locus of (M, ∇) is contained in S.
(c) The vector bundle M is free.
Proof.
Suppose that we have found an (M, ∇) which has defect 0 and satisﬁes
(a) and (b). The type of M is then a1 = · · · = an. Then M(−a1[s]) (for any
s ∈S) is free and still satisﬁes (a) and (b).
Let N be an integer >
n(n−1)
2
(−2 + #S). We start with a regular singular
connection (M, ∇) with singular locus in S such that:
(i) Its generic ﬁbre is (M, ∇).
(ii) For some s ∈S the Os-module 
Ms has a basis e1, . . . , en such that ∇(ei) =
dts
ts ⊗ ai,jej with all ai,j ∈Os and ai,j ∈tN
s Os for i ̸= j.
The existence follows from 6.20 and 6.18. We note that Lemma 6.21 implies that
N will be greater than the defect of (M, ∇). In the next steps we modify M.
Suppose that M has a defect > 0, then the canonical ﬁltration F 1 ⊂F 2 ⊂. . .
of M has at least two terms. Let i be deﬁned by F i−1 ̸= M and F i = M. The
images of e1, . . . , en in V := 
Ms/ts 
Ms form a basis of eigenvectors for the map
δs (see Lemma 6.19 for the notation). Suppose that the image of ek does not lie
in F i−1(V ). We apply Lemma 6.19 and ﬁnd a new regular singular connection
M(1) which has, according to Lemma 6.17, a strictly smaller defect. For 
M(1)s
the matrix of δs with respect to the f1, . . . , fn has again property (ii), but now
with N replaced by N −1. Thus we can repeat this step to produce connections
M(2) et cetera, until the defect of some M(i) is 0.
2
Remarks 6.23
1.
The proof of Theorem 6.22 fails for reducible regular
singular connections (M, ∇) over C(z)/C, since there is no bound for the defect
of the corresponding vector bundles M. This prevents us from making an a
priori choice of the number N used in the proof.
2. The proof of Theorem 6.22 works also under the assumption that for some
singular point the diﬀerential module 
C(z)s ⊗M is “semi-simple”.
By this
we mean that there is a basis e1, . . . , en of 
C(z)s ⊗M over 
C(z)s such that

COUNTING FUCHSIAN EQUATIONS
187
∇(ei) = dts
ts ⊗aiei for certain elements ai ∈Os. In this case, condition (ii) in
the proof holds for any N > 1 and in particular for any N greater than the
defect D of the vector bundle. The proof then proceeds to produce connections
of decreasing defect and halts after D steps. For the case C = C, the connection

C(z)s ⊗M is semi-simple if and only if the local monodromy map at the point
s is semi-simple. This gives a modern proof of the result of Plemelj [223].
3. Let the regular singular connection (M, ∇) with singularities in S be given.
Take any point p ̸∈S and consider S′ = S ∪{p}. Since the local monodromy
at p is trivial, one can follow the above remark 2. and conclude that there is
a regular singular connection (M, ∇) with singular locus in S′ such that M is
free.
4.
The Riemann-Hilbert problem has a strong solution for a connection of
dimension two, as noted by Dekkers [79]. Indeed, we have only to consider a
reducible regular singular connection (M, ∇). After replacing M by the tensor
product N ⊗M, where N is a 1-dimensional regular singular connection with
singular locus in S, we may suppose that M contains a vector e1 ̸= 0 with
∇(e1) = 0. A second vector e2 can be chosen such that ∇(e2) = ω2⊗e2+ω3⊗e1,
where ω2 ∈H0(P 1, Ω(S)) and with ω3 some meromorphic diﬀerential form.
It suﬃces to ﬁnd an h ∈C(z) such that f2 = e2 + he1 satisﬁes ∇(f2) =
ω2 ⊗f2 + ˜ω3 ⊗e1 with ˜ω3 ∈H0(P 1, Ω(S)).
One calculates ˜ω3 = −hω2 + dh + ω3. For each point p ∈P 1 we are given that
the connection is regular singular (or regular) and that implies the existence of
an hp ∈
C(z)p such that the corresponding ˜ω3 lies in 
Ω(S)p. One may replace
this hp by its “principal part [hp]p” at the point p. Take now h ∈C(z) which
has for each point p the principal part [hp]p. Then for this h the expression ˜ω3
lies in H0(P 1, Ω(S)).
2
6.6
Counting Fuchsian Equations
One might hope that an even stronger result holds, namely that an irreducible
regular singular connection M over C(z) with singular locus in S can be rep-
resented by a scalar Fuchsian equation with singular locus in S. By counting
dimensions of moduli spaces we will show that, in general, any monic scalar
“equation” L ∈C(z)[∂] representing M, has singularities outside S. Those new
singular points for L are called apparent.
Deﬁnition 6.24 An apparent singularity p for any L = ∂n+a1∂n−1+· · ·+an ∈
C(z)[∂], is a pole of some ai and such that L has n independent solutions in
C((z −p)).
2
Exercise 6.25 1. Show that, at an apparent singularity of L, there must be n
distinct local exponents. Hint: To any basis f1, . . . , fn of the solution space of L

188
CHAPTER 6. EQUATIONS AND RIEMANN-HILBERT
at p, with ordpfi ≤ordpfi+1 associate the n-tuple (ordpf1, . . . , ordpfn). Show
that there are only ﬁnitely many n-tuples that can arise in this way and that a
maximal one (in the lexicographic order) has distinct entries.
2.
Let f1, . . . , fn ∈C((z −p)) denote n independent solutions of L.
Show
that the Wronskian of f1, . . . , fn, which is an element of C((z −p))∗, has order
m1 + · · · + mn −n(n−1)
2
. Hint: We may assume that each fi = xmi+ higher
order terms where the mi are the distinct exponents. Show that the term of
lowest order in wr(f1, . . . fn) is wr(xm1, . . . , xmn).
2
Deﬁnition 6.26 Let p be an apparent singularity of L ∈C(z)[∂] and let α1 <
· · · < αn be the local exponents of L at the point p. One deﬁnes the weight of
the apparent singularity to be
weight(L, p) = α1 + · · · + αn −n(n −1)
2
.
In the sequel we will only consider apparent singularities such that 0 ≤α1 <
· · · < αn. Under this assumption, weight(L, p) = 0 holds if and only if no ai has
a pole at p (in other words p is not a singularity at all).
Lemma 6.27 Let V be a vector space of dimension n over C and let C((t))⊗V
be equipped with the trivial connection ∇(f ⊗v) = df ⊗v for all f ∈C((t))
and v ∈V . Consider a cyclic vector e ∈C[[t]] ⊗V and the minimal monic
L ∈C((t))[∂] with Le = 0. The weight of L is equal to the dimension over C of
(C[[t]] ⊗V )/(C[[t]]e + C[[t]]∂e + · · · + C[[t]]∂n−1e). This number is also equal
to the order of the element e ∧∂e ∧· · · ∧∂n−1e ∈C[[t]] ⊗ΛnV ∼= C[[t]].
Proof.
The element e can be written as 
m≥0 vmtm with all vm ∈V . One
then has ∂e = 
m≥0 vmmtm−1. Since e is a cyclic vector, its coeﬃcients vm
generate the vector space V . Let us call m a “jump” if vm does not belong to
the subspace of V generated by the vk with k < m. Let α1 < · · · < αn denote
the jumps.
A straightforward calculation (as in Exercise 6.25.1) shows that the order of
e ∧∂e ∧· · · ∧∂n−1e ∈C[[t]] ⊗ΛnV ∼= C[[t]] is α1 + · · · + αn −n(n−1)
2
. A similar
calculation shows that this number is also the dimension of the vector space
(C[[t]]⊗V )/(C[[t]]e+C[[t]]∂e+· · ·+C[[t]]∂n−1e). It suﬃces to show that α1 <
· · · < αn are the local exponents of L. We note that Le = 
m≥0 vmL(tm) = 0.
Take any linear map φ : V →C. Then L(y) = 0 where y = 
m≥0 φ(vm)tm ∈
C[[t]]. By varying φ one obtains solutions y ∈C[[t]] of L(y) = 0 with orders
α1 < · · · < αn.
2
We consider now an irreducible regular singular connection M over C(z) whose
dimension is n and singular locus in S = {s0, s1, . . . , sk, ∞}. There is a Fuchs

z−sj representing the connection. We denote the stan-
dard basis by e1, . . . , en. Let R := C[z, 1
F ] with F = (z −s0) · · · (z −sk). The
free R-module Re1 + · · · + Ren ⊂M is invariant under the action of ∂.
Lemma 6.28 Let v ∈M, v ̸= 0 and let L be the minimal monic operator with
Lv = 0. Then L is Fuchsian if and only if v ∈Re1 +· · ·+Ren and the elements
v, ∂v, . . . , ∂n−1v form a basis of the R-module Re1 + · · · + Ren.
Proof.
Suppose that v satisﬁes the properties of the lemma. Then ∂nv is an
R-linear combination of v, ∂v, . . . , ∂n−1v. Thus L has only singularities in S.
Since M is regular singular it follows (as in the proof of Lemma 6.11) that L is
a Fuchsian operator.
On the other hand, suppose that L is Fuchsian. Then N := Rv + R∂v + · · · +
R∂n−1v is a R-submodule of M, containing a basis of M over C(z) and invariant
under ∂. There is only one such object (as one concludes from Lemma 6.18)
and thus N = Re1 + · · · + Ren.
2
Proposition 6.29 Let 0 ̸= v ∈Re1+· · ·+Ren ⊂M and L with Lv = 0 be as in
Lemma 6.28. Consider the operator ∆= F ·∂. Deﬁne the polynomial P ∈C[z],
which has no zeros in {s0, . . . , sk}, by the formula v ∧∆v ∧· · · ∧∆n−1v =
(z −s0)n0 · · · (z −sk)nkP · e1 ∧· · · ∧en. Then the degree of P is equal to the
sum of the weights of the apparent singularities of L (outside S).
Proof.
The dimension of the space (Re1+· · ·+Ren)/(Rv+R∂v+· · ·+R∂n−1v)
is equal to the degree of P. This dimension is the sum of the dimensions, taken
over the apparent singular points p, of
(C[[z −p]]e1 + · · · + C[[z −p]]en)/(C[[z −p]]v + · · · + C[[z −p]]∂n−1v).
Now the statement follows from Lemma 6.27.
2
Proposition 6.30 We use the notations above. There is a choice for the vector
v such that for the monic operator L with Lv = 0 the sum of the weights of the
apparent singular points is
≤n(n−1)
2
k + 1 −n.
Proof.
Choose numbers d0, . . . , dk ∈{0, 1, . . ., n−1} such that d0 +· · ·+dk =
n −1 and choose for each j = 0, . . . , k a subspace Vj ⊂Ce1 + · · · Cen of
codimension dj and invariant under Aj.
For example, one may select d0 =
n −1, d1 = . . . = dk = 0, V0 to be spanned by an eigenvector of A0 and
V1 = . . . = Vk = Ce1 + . . . + Cen. For v we take a non zero vector in the
intersection V0 ∩V1 ∩· · · ∩Vk and consider the polynomial Q(z) deﬁned by
v ∧∆v ∧· · ·∧∆n−1v = Q(z)e1 ∧· · ·∧en. The degree of this polynomial is easily
seen to be ≤n(n−1)
2
k. We give now a local calculation at the point z = sj which
shows that the polynomial Q has a zero of order ≥dj at sj. Let t denote a

local parameter at sj. We may replace the operator ∆by δ := t d
dt + Aj + O(t),
where O(t) denotes terms divisible by t. Then δmv = Am
j v + O(t). For m ≥
n −dj one has that Am
j v is a linear combination of v, Ajv, . . . , An−dj−1
j
v. Thus
v ∧δv ∧· · · ∧δn−1v is divisible by tdj.
We conclude that Q is divisible by (z −s0)d0 · · · (z −sk)dk. We can now apply
Proposition 6.29 with a polynomial P of degree ≤n(n−1)
2
k + 1 −n.

z−1, where
A0, A1 are constant 2 × 2-matrices and S = {0, 1, ∞}.
We will make the proof of Proposition 6.30 explicit and show that there exists
a scalar Fuchsian equation for this system without apparent singularities. Let
e1, e2 denote the standard basis. Let R denote the ring C[z,
1
z(z−1)]. The free
R-module Re1 + Re2 is invariant under the action of ∂.
We take for v ̸= 0 a constant vector, i.e., in Ce1+Ce2, which is an eigenvector for
the matrix A0. Consider the determinant v∧∂v = v∧( A0v
z + A1v
z−1) =
1
z−1v∧A1v.
From the irreducibility of the equation it follows that v is not an eigenvector for
A1. Thus the determinant has the form
c
z−1e1 ∧e2 with c ∈C∗and v, ∂v form
a basis for Re1 + Re2. This proves the claim.
2
We will count “moduli”, i.e., the number of parameters in certain families
of diﬀerential equations. In the classical literature one uses the term number of
accessory parameters for what is called “moduli” here. We start by considering
the family of Fuchsian operators L of degree n with regular singularities in the
set S = {s0, . . . , sk, ∞}. Let ∆denote the operator (z −s0) · · · (z −sk) d
dz. Then
L can be rewritten as a monic operator in ∆, namely L = ∆n + C1∆n−1 +
· · · + Cn−1∆+ Cn. The coeﬃcients are polynomials with deg Cj ≤j · k (see
Lemma 6.11). This family has clearly n(n+1)
2
k + n parameters.
Our next goal is to count the number of parameters of the family F (of the
isomorphism classes) of the “generic” regular singular connections M over C(z)
of dimension n with singular locus in S = {s0, . . . , sk, ∞}. Of course the terms
“family, generic, parameters” are somewhat vague. The term “generic” should
at least imply that M is irreducible and thus can be represented by a Fuchs
system ∂+ 
Aj
z−sj . The matrices A0, . . . , Ak with coeﬃcients in C are chosen
generically. In particular, for every point s ∈S there is a basis e1, . . . , en of

C(z)s ⊗M such that the action of δs = ∇ts
d
dts takes the form δsej =
λj(s)ej and λi(s) −λj(s) ̸∈Z for i ̸= j. This property implies that for each
point s ∈S there are only countably many lattices possible which give rise to
a vector bundle with a connection (see Lemma 6.18). Further the lattices can
be chosen such that the corresponding vector bundle with connection is free
(see Remarks 6.23). Thus we may as well count the number of parameters of
generic Fuchs systems of dimension n and with singular locus in S. Let V be a
vector space over C of dimension n. Then we have to choose k + 1 linear maps

191
Aj : V →V , up to simultaneous conjugation with elements of GL(V ). This
leads to the formula kn2 + 1 for the number of parameters for F.
We can now draw the conclusion.
Corollary 6.32 A general Fuchsian system of rank n with k+2 singular points
cannot be represented by a scalar Fuchs equation if n2k + 1 >
n(n+1)
2
k + n.
In other words, the only cases for which scalar Fuchsian equations (without
apparent singularities) exist are given by kn ≤2.
Remarks 6.33 Counting moduli and the number of apparent singularities.
1. Now we want to count the number of moduli for monic scalar operators L of
degree n with k + 2 regular singularities, i.e., S, and l apparent singular points
a1, . . . , al of weight 1 for which we do not ﬁx the position. Let ∆denote the
operator (z −s0) · · · (z −sk)(z −a1) · · · (z −al) d
dz and represent L as L = ∆n +
C1∆n−1 +· · ·+Cn−1∆+Cn with the Cj’s polynomials of degrees ≤j(k +l). At
each of the apparent singular points we ﬁx the exponents to be 0, 1, . . ., n−2, n.
This produces l equations. The condition that there are no logarithmic terms
at any of the apparent singular point is given by n(n−1)
2
l equations (see [224],
Ch. 8 §18). Assuming that the equations are independent and that they deﬁne a
non empty algebraic variety, one ﬁnds that this algebraic variety has dimension
n(n+1)
2
k + n + l. We note that it seems diﬃcult to verify these assumption and
we have not done this in general.
2. Assuming that the algebraic variety in 1. has dimension n(n+1)
2
k + n + l, we
will show that the bound n(n−1)
2
k + 1 −n of Proposition 6.30 is sharp for a
general regular singular connection M of dimension n over C(z) with singular
locus S = {s0, . . . , sk, ∞}. Indeed, let A be the sharp bound. Take l = A in (a)
above and one ﬁnds the number of moduli n(n+1)
2
k+n+A. This must be equal to
n2k+1, the number of moduli for the family F above. Thus A = n(n−1)
2
k+1−n.
3. Now assume that the bound n(n−1)
2
k + 1 −n of Proposition 6.30 is sharp.
Then, as in 2., a comparison of dimensions of moduli spaces yields that the
formula in 3. for the number of moduli is correct.
4. The counting of parameters that we have done, if correct, clariﬁes an ob-
servation made by N. Katz on accessory parameters in the introduction of his
book ([156], p. 5-7).

Exact Asymptotics
7.1
Introduction and Notation
Singularities of linear complex diﬀerential equations is a subject with a long his-
tory. New methods, often of an algebraic nature, have kept the subject young
and growing. In this chapter we treat the asymptotic theory of divergent solu-
tions and the more reﬁned theory of multisummation of those solutions. The the-
ory of multisummation has been developed by many authors, such as W. Balser,
B.L.J. Braaksma, J. ´Ecalle, W.B. Jurkat, D. Lutz, M. Loday-Richaud, B. Mal-
grange, J. Martinet, J.-P. Ramis, and Y. Sibuya. Excellent bibliographies can
be found in [176] and [179]. Our aim is to give a complete proof of the multi-
summation theorem, based on what is called “the Main Asymptotic Existence
Theorem” and some sheaf cohomology.
In particular, the involved analytic
theory of Laplace and Borel transforms has been avoided. However, the link
between the cohomology groups and the Laplace and Borel method is made
transparent in examples. This way of presenting the theory is close to the paper
of Malgrange [194].
The problem can be presented as follows. Let C({z}) denote the ﬁeld of the
convergent Laurent series (in the variable z) and C((z)) the ﬁeld of all formal
Laurent series. The elements of C({z}) have an interpretation as meromorphic
functions on a disk {z ∈C| |z| < r}, for small enough r > 0, and having at
most a pole at 0. Put δ := z d
dz. Let A be an n × n-matrix with entries in
C({z}).
The diﬀerential equation that concerns us is (δ −A)v = w, where
v, w are vectors with coordinates in either C({z}) or C((z)), and where δ acts
coordinate wise on vectors. The diﬀerential equation is (irregular) singular at
z = 0 if some entry of A has a pole at 0 and such that this remains the case
after any C({z})-linear change of coordinates. For such a diﬀerential equation
one encounters the following situation:
There is a formal (or divergent) solution ˆv of (δ −A)ˆv = w with w convergent,
193

194
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
i.e., ˆv has coordinates in C((z)) and w has coordinates in C({z}).
We have written here ˆv to indicate that the solution is in general formal and
not convergent. The standard example of this situation is the expression ˆv =

n≥0 n! zn, which is a solution of Euler’s equation (δ −(z−1 −1))ˆv = −z−1.
The problem is to give ˆv a meaning. A naive way to deal with this situation is
to replace ˆv by a well chosen truncation of the Laurent series involved. Our goal
is to associate with ˆv a meromorphic function deﬁned in a suitable domain and
having ˆv as its “asymptotic expansion”. We begin by giving a formal deﬁnition
of this notion and some reﬁnements.
Let ρ be a continuous function on the open interval (a, b) with values in the
positive real numbers R>0, or in R>0 ∪{+∞}. An open sector S(a, b, ρ) is the
set of the complex numbers z ̸= 0 satisfying arg(z) ∈(a, b) and |z| < ρ(arg(z)).
The a, b are in fact elements of the circle S1 := R/2πZ. The positive (counter-
clockwise) orientation of the circle determines the sector. In some situations it
is better to introduce a function t with eit = z and to view a sector as a subset
of the t-plane given by the relations Re(t) ∈(a, b) and e−Im(t) < ρ(Re(t)). We
will also have occasion to use closed sectors given by relations arg(z) ∈[a, b]
and 0 < |z| ≤c, with c ∈R>0.
Deﬁnition 7.1 A holomorphic function f on S(a, b, ρ) is said to have the formal
Laurent series 
n≥n0 cnzn as asymptotic expansion if for every N ≥0 and every
closed sector W in S(a, b, ρ) there exists a constant C(N, W) such that
|f(z) −

n0≤n≤N−1
cnzn| ≤C(N, W)|z|N for all z ∈W
One writes J(f) for the formal Laurent series 
n≥n0 cnzn. Let A(S(a, b, ρ))
denote the set of holomorphic functions on this sector which have an asymptotic
expansion. For an open interval (a, b) on the circle S1, one deﬁnes A(a, b) as
the direct limit of the A(S(a, b, ρ)) for all ρ.
2
In more detail, this means that the elements of A(a, b) are equivalence classes
of pairs (f, S(a, b, ρ)) with f ∈A(S(a, b, ρ)). The equivalence relation is given
by (f1, S(a, b, ρ1)) ∼(f2, S(a, b, ρ2)) if there is a pair (f3, S(a, b, ρ3)) such that
S(a, b, ρ3) ⊂S(a, b, ρ1) ∩S(a, b, ρ2) and f3 = f1 = f2 holds on S(a, b, ρ3). For
any open U ⊂S1, an element f of A(U) is deﬁned by a covering by open
intervals U = ∪i(ai, bi) and a set of elements fi ∈A(ai, bi) with the property
that the restrictions of any fi and fj to (ai, bi) ∩(aj, bj) coincide. One easily
veriﬁes that this deﬁnition makes A into a sheaf on S1. Let A0 denote the
subsheaf of A consisting of the elements with asymptotic expansion 0. We let
Ad, A0
d, . . . denote the stalks of the sheaves A, A0, . . . at a point d ∈S1.

2. Show that A(S(a, b, ρ)) is a diﬀerential C-algebra, that is a C-algebra closed
under the operation of taking derivatives. Hint: (c.f., [194]) The proofs that
A(S(a, b, ρ)) is closed under multiplication and sum are straightforward. To
verify that this algebra is closed under diﬀerentiation, it suﬃces to show the
following: Let g be a function analytic in a sector W. If for any closed subsectors
W ′ ⊂W one has that there exists a constant C such that for all z ∈W ′, |g(z)| ≤
C|z|n+1, then for any closed subsectors W ′ ⊂W one has that there exists a
constant C′ such that for all z ∈W ′, |g′(z)| ≤C′|z|n. To prove this, let W ′ ⊊
W ′′ be closed sectors and let δ be a positive integer so that for all z ∈W ′ the
closed ball {w | |w−z| ≤|z|δ} lies entirely in W ′′. The Cauchy Integral Formula
states that, for all z ∈W ′
g′(z) =
1
2πi

γ
g(ζ)
(ζ −z)2 dζ
where γ is the circle of radius |z|δ centered at z. One then has that for all
z ∈W ′
|g′(z)| ≤maxγ |g|
|z|δ
≤C′′|z|n+1 (1 + δ)n+1
|z|δ
≤C′|z|n
Apply this to g = f −n
k=0 akzk. Note that the asymptotic expansion of f ′ is
the term-by-term derivative of the asymptotic expansion of f.
2
The following result shows that every formal Laurent series is the asymptotic
expansion of some function.
Theorem 7.3 Borel-Ritt For every open interval (a, b) ̸= S1, the map J :
A(a, b) →C((z)) is surjective.
Proof.
We will prove this for the sector S given by | arg(z)| < π and 0 <
|z| < +∞.
Let √z be the branch of the square root function that satisﬁes
| arg √z| < π/2 for z ∈S. We ﬁrst note that for any real number b, the function
β(z) = 1 −e−b/√z satisﬁes |β(z)| ≤
b
√
|z| since Re(−b
√z) < 0 for all z ∈S.
Furthermore β(z) has asymptotic expansion 0 on S.
Let  anzn be a formal Laurent series. By subtracting a ﬁnite sum of terms
we may assume that this series has no negative terms. Let bn be a sequence such
that the series  anbnRn converges for all real R > 0. For example, we may let
b0 = 0 and bn = 0 if an = 0 and bn = 1/n!|an| if an ̸= 0. Let W be a closed
sector deﬁned by arg(z) ∈[a, b] and 0 < |z| ≤R in S. Let βn(z) = 1 −e−bn/√z
and f(z) =  anβn(z)zn. Since |anβn(z)zn| ≤|an|bn|z|n−1/2, the function f(z)

The Main Asymptotic Existence Theorem states the following:
Given is a formal solution ˆv of an equation (δ −A)ˆv = w (with A and w con-
vergent) and a direction d ∈S1. Then there exists an interval (a, b) containing
d and a v ∈(A(a, b))n such that J(v) = ˆv and (δ −A)v = w.
In the next section we will present an elementary proof of the Main Asymptotic
Existence Theorem. We will call a v, having the properties of this theorem,
an asymptotic lift of ˆv.
The diﬀerence of two asymptotic lifts is a solution
g ∈A0(a, b) of (δ −A)g = 0. In general, non trivial solutions g exist. In order
to obtain a unique asymptotic lift v on certain sectors one has to reﬁne the
asymptotic theory by introducing Gevrey functions and Gevrey series.
Deﬁnition 7.4 Let k be a positive real number and let S be an open sector. A
function f ∈A(S), with asymptotic expansion J(f) = 
n≥n0 cnzn, is said to
be a Gevrey function of order k if the following holds: For every closed subsector
W of S there are constants A > 0 and c > 0 such that for all N ≥1 and all
z ∈W and |z| ≤c one has
|f(z) −

n0≤n≤N−1
cnzn| ≤ANΓ(1 + N
k )|z|N
2
We note that this is stronger than saying that f has asymptotic expansion J(f)
on S, since on any closed subsector one prescribes the form of the constants
C(N, W). Further we note that one may replace in this deﬁnition the (maybe
mysterious) term Γ(1 + N
k ) by (N!)1/k. The set of all Gevrey functions on S of
order k is denoted by A 1
k (S). One sees, as in Exercise 7.2, that this set is in
fact an algebra over C and is invariant under diﬀerentiation. Moreover, A1/k
can be seen as a subsheaf of A on S1. We denote by A0
1/k(S) the subset of
A1/k(S), consisting of the functions with asymptotic expansion 0. Again A0
1/k
can be seen as a subsheaf of A1/k on S1. The following useful lemma gives an
alternative description of the sections of the sheaf A0
1/k.

7.1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION
197
Lemma 7.5 Let f be holomorphic on an open sector S. Then f belongs to
A0
1
k (S) if and only if for every closed subsector W there are positive constants
A, B such that |f(z)| ≤A exp( −B|z|−k) holds for z ∈W.
Proof.
We will use Stirling’s formula:
Γ(1 + s) =
√
2π ss+1/2e−s(1 + o(s−1)) for s ∈R and s →∞.
If f belongs to A0
1
k (S) then there is a constant C depending on W such that,
for all n ≥1 and z ∈W, one has |f(z)| ≤CnΓ(1 + n
k )|z|n. In other words
log |f(z)| ≤n
k (−1 + log |Cz|k) + (n
k + 1/2) log n
k + a constant.
For a ﬁxed |z| the right hand side has, as a function of the integer n, almost
minimal value if n is equal to the integer part of
k
|Cz|k . Substituting this value
for n one ﬁnds that log |f(z)| ≤−B|z|−k+ a constant. This implies the required
inequality.
For the other implication of the lemma, it suﬃces to show that for given k and
B there is a positive D such that
r−nexp(−Br−k)
Γ(1 + n
k )
≤Dn holds for all r and n ≥1.
Using Stirling’s formula, the logarithm of the left hand side can be estimated
by
n
k (1 + log r−k −log n
k ) −1/2 log n
k −Br−k + a constant.
For a ﬁxed n and variable r the maximal value of this expression is obtained for
r−k = B−1 n
k . Substitution of this value gives
n
k log B−1 −1/2 log n
k + a constant.
This expression is bounded by a constant multiple of n.
2
The notion of Gevrey function of order k does not have the properties, that
we will require, for k ≤1/2. In the sequel we suppose that k > 1/2. In the event
of a smaller k one may replace z by a suitable root z
1
m in order to obtain a new
k′ = mk > 1/2. We note further that the k’s that interest us are slopes of the
Newton polygon of the diﬀerential equation δ −A. Those k’s are in fact rational
and, after taking a suitable root of z, one may restrict to positive integers k.
Exercise 7.6 Let f ∈A1/k(S) with J(f) = 
n≥n0 cnzn. Prove that for N ≥1
the cN satisfy the inequalities
|cN| ≤ANΓ(1 + N
k ), for a suitable constant A and all N ≥1

2
Exercise 7.6 leads to the notion of Gevrey series of order k.
Deﬁnition 7.7 f = 
n≥n0 cnzn ∈C((z)) is called a Gevrey series of order k
if there is a constant A > 0 such that for all n > 0 one has |cn| ≤AnΓ(1 + n
k ).
The set of all such series is denoted by C((z)) 1
k . The subset of the power series
satisfying the above condition on the coeﬃcients is denoted by C[[z]] 1
k .
2
As in the deﬁnition of Gevrey functions of order k, one can replace the
condition |cn| ≤AnΓ(1 + n
k ) with |cn| ≤AnΓ(n!)
1
k .
Lemma 7.8
1. C[[z]] 1
k is a diﬀerential ring with a unique maximal ideal,
namely the ideal (z).
2. C((z)) 1
k is the ﬁeld of fractions of C[[z]] 1
k .
3. If k < l then C[[z]] 1
k ⊃C[[z]] 1
l .
Proof.
1. The set A = C[[z]] 1
k is clearly closed under addition. To see that
it is closed under multiplication, let f =  aizi and g =  bizi be elements of
this set and assume |aN| ≤AN(N!)1/k and |bN| ≤BN(N!)1/k for all N ≥1. We
then have fg =  cizi where |cN| = | N
i=0 aibN−i| ≤N
i=0 AiBN−i(i!)1/k(N −
i)1/k ≤(AB)N(N + 1)(N!)1/k ≤CN(N!)1/k for an appropriate C. The ring A
is closed under taking derivatives because if |aN| ≤AN(N!)1/k, then |NaN| ≤
NAN(N!)1/k ≤CN((N −1)!)1/k for an appropriate C.
To prove the statement concerning the ideal (z), it suﬃces to show that any
element f =  aizi not in the ideal (z) is invertible in C[[z]] 1
k . Since a0 ̸= 0
such an element is clearly invertible in C[[z]]. Let g =  bizi be the inverse of
f. We have that b0 = 1/a0 and for N ≥1, bN = −(1/a0)(a1bN−1 + . . . + aNb0).
One then shows by induction that |bN| ≤CN(N!)1/k for an appropriate C.
2. and 3. are clear.
2
In a later section we will prove the following important properties of Gevrey
functions.
1. If |b −a| ≤
π
k the map J : A 1
k (a, b) →C((z)) 1
k is surjective but not
injective. (Consequently A0
1/k(a, b) ̸= 0).
2. If |b −a| >
π
k the map J : A 1
k (a, b) →C((z)) 1
k is injective but not
surjective. (Consequently A0
1/k(a, b) = 0).
We note that the above statements are false for k ≤1/2, since A(S1) =
C({z}). This is the reason to suppose k > 1/2. However, the case k ≤1/2 can
be treated by allowing ramiﬁcation, i.e., replacing z by a suitable z1/n.

7.1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION
199
Deﬁnition 7.9 Let ˆy ∈C((z)). Then ˆy is called k-summable in the direction
d if there is an f ∈A 1
k (d −α
2 , d + α
2 ) with J(f) = ˆy and α > π
k . We note that f
is unique. One says that ˆy ∈C((z))1/k is k-summable if there are only ﬁnitely
many directions d such that ˆy is not k-summable in the direction d.
2
We can now formulate the results of the multisummation theory. A special
case is the k-summation theorem (c.f., [236], Thm 3.28, p. 80):
Suppose that the diﬀerential equation (δ −A) has only one positive slope k (and
k > 1/2) and consider a formal solution ˆv of (δ −A)ˆv = w (with A and w
convergent). Then (each coordinate of) ˆv is k-summable.
We draw some conclusions from this statement. The ﬁrst one is that the (in
general) divergent solution ˆv is not very divergent. Indeed, its coordinates lie in
C((z))1/k. Let d be a direction for which ˆv is k-summable. Then the element
v ∈(A1/k(d −α
2 , d + α
2 ))n with image J(v) = ˆv ∈C((z))n is unique. Moreover
g := (δ−A)v is a vector with coordinates again in A1/k(d−α
2 , d+ α
2 ), with α > π
k
and with J(g) = w. From the injectivity of J : A1/k(d −α
2 , d + α
2 ) →C((z))1/k,
one concludes that g = w and that v satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation (δ−A)v =
w. Thus v is the unique asymptotic lift, produced by the k-summation theorem.
One calls v the k-sum of ˆv in the direction d.
One possible formulation of the multisummation theorem is:
Suppose that k1 < k2 < · · · < kr (with k1 > 1/2) are the positive slopes of the
equation (δ−A) and let ˆv be a formal solution of the equation (δ−A)ˆv = w (with
w convergent).
There are ﬁnitely many “bad” directions, called the singular
directions of δ −A. If d is not a singular direction, then ˆv can be written as
a sum ˆv1 + ˆv2 + · · · + ˆvr where each ˆvi is ki-summable in the direction d and
moreover (δ −A)ˆvi is convergent.
We draw again some conclusions. First of all ˆv ∈(C((z))1/k1)n. Let d be a
direction which is not singular. Then each ˆvi is ki-summable in the direction d
and wi := (δ−A)ˆvi is convergent. There are unique elements vi with coordinates
in A1/ki(d−αi
2 , d+ αi
2 ), with αi > π
ki and image ˆvi under J. Then (δ −A)vi has
coordinates in A1/ki(d−αi
2 , d+ αi
2 ) and its asymptotic expansion is wi, which is
convergent. Since A0
1/ki(d−αi
2 , d+ αi
2 ) = 0, it follows that (δ−A)vi = wi. Then
the sum v = 
i vi has coordinates in A(d −αr
2 , d + αr
2 ) and satisﬁes J(v) = ˆv.
Moreover (δ −A)v = w. One calls v the multisum of ˆv in the direction d. Note
though that v depends on the decomposition of ˆv as a sum ˆv1 + ˆv2 + · · · + ˆvr.
The multisummation theory also carries the name exact asymptotics because
it reﬁnes the Main Asymptotic Existence Theorem by producing a uniquely
deﬁned asymptotic lift for all but ﬁnitely many directions. Since the multisum
is uniquely deﬁned, one expects an “explicit formula” for it. Indeed, the usual
way to prove the multisummation theorem is based on a sequence of Borel and

200
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
Laplace transforms and analytic continuations, which gives in a certain sense
an “explicit formula” for the multisum . We will explain, in later sections, some
details of this and of the related Stokes phenomenon.
7.2
The Main Asymptotic Existence Theorem
We recall the statement of this theorem.
Theorem 7.10 Main Asymptotic Existence Theorem
Let ˆv be a formal solution of (δ −A)ˆv = w, where A is an n×n-matrix and w is
a vector of length n, both with coordinates in C({z}). Let d ∈S1 be a direction.
Then there is an open interval (a, b) containing d and a v ∈(A(a, b))n with
J(v) = ˆv and (δ −A)v = w.
Remarks 7.11 1. Complete proofs of this theorem, originally due to Hukuhara
and Turrittin, are given in [300] and [192]. Extensions of this theorem have been
developed by J.-P. Ramis and Y. Sibuya [242].
2. Theorem 7.10 is an almost immediate consequence of the ﬁrst part of Theorem
7.12 below. Indeed, by the Borel-Ritt theorem, we can choose a ˜v ∈(Ad)n with
J(˜v) = ˆv. Then g = w −(δ −A)˜v ∈(A0
d)n and, by the ﬁrst part of Theorem
7.12, one can solve the equation (δ −A)f = g with some f ∈(A0
d)n. Recall that
Ad, A0
d, . . . denote the stalks of the sheaves A, A0, . . . at a point d ∈S1.
3. In this section we will give a complete and elementary proof of Theorem
7.10, inspired by ([192], Appendix 1). First we study in detail the special case
n = 1, i.e., inhomogeneous equations of order 1. The step from inhomogeneous
equations of order 1 to “quasi-split” equations is rather straightforward. Finally,
with a small calculation concerning norms on a linear space of analytic functions,
the general case is proved.
2
Theorem 7.12 Let A be an n×n-matrix with entries in C({z}) and let d ∈S1
be a direction. The operator (δ−A) acts surjectively on (A0
d)n and on ((A0
1/k)d)n
for any k > 0.
It suﬃces to consider in the sequel the direction 0. We will ﬁrst be concerned
with the equation (δ −q)f = g, with q ∈z−1C[z−1] and g ∈A0
0. The goal is
to ﬁnd a solution f ∈A0
0. The general solution of the equation can be written,
symbolically, as e(q)(z)  e(−q)(t)g(t) dt
t + ae(q)(z) where e(q) = e
 q(t) dt
t . The
problem is to ﬁnd the correct value of the constant a ∈C. Moreover, we will
need more precise information on this solution f. For this purpose we consider
closed sectors Σ = Σ(c, d) = {z ∈C| 0 < |z| ≤c and | arg(z)| ≤d} for c, d > 0.
Let F = F(Σ) denote the set of complex valued functions f on Σ, such that:
1. f is continuous on Σ.

7.2. THE MAIN ASYMPTOTIC EXISTENCE THEOREM
201
2. f is holomorphic on the interior of Σ.
3. For every integer N ≥1, there exists a constant CN such that |f(z)| ≤
CN|z|N holds for all z ∈Σ.
On F one considers a sequence of norms ∥∥N deﬁned by ∥f∥N = supz∈Σ | f(z)
zN |.
We note that every element of A0
0 can be represented by an element in F for
a suitable choice of c, d. On the other hand, any element of F determines an
element of A0
0. In other words, A0
0 is the direct limit of the spaces F(Σ).
Lemma 7.13 Let q = qlz−l+ql−1z−l+1+· · ·+q1z−1 ∈z−1C[z−1], with ql ̸= 0,
be given.
1. Suppose Re(ql) < 0. For small enough c, d > 0 there is a linear operator
K : F →F with F = F(Σ(c, d)), such that (δ −q)K is the identity on
F and K is a contraction for every ∥∥N with N ≥2, i.e., ∥K(g)∥N ≤
cN∥g∥N with cN < 1 and all g ∈F.
2. Suppose Re(ql) = 0. Then statement 1. remains valid.
3. Suppose Re(ql) > 0 and let N > 0 be an integer. For small enough c, d > 0
there is a linear operator K : F →F such that (δ −q)K is the identity on
F and K is a contraction for ∥∥N.
Corollary 7.14 Let q be as in Lemma 7.13.
1. (δ −q) acts surjectively on A0
0.
2. (δ −q) acts surjectively on (A0
1/k)0.
Proof.
1. The existence of K in Lemma 7.13 proves that (δ −q) is surjective
on A0
0. We note that this result remains valid if q is a ﬁnite sum of terms qsz−s
with s ∈R>0.
2. Lemma 7.5 easily yields that (A0
1/k)0 is the union of A0
0e(Bz−k), taken over
all B ∈R>0. It suﬃces to show that (δ −q) is surjective on each of the spaces
A0
0e(Bz−k). The observation e(Bz−k)−1(δ −q)e(Bz−k) = (δ −q −kBz−k),
reduces the latter to the ﬁrst part of this corollary.
2
The Proof of Lemma 7.13
(1) The function e(q), deﬁned by e(q)(z) = e
  q(t) dt
t , is a solution of the ho-
mogeneous equation (δ −q)e(q) = 0. The expression

q(t) dt
t is chosen to be
ql
−lz−l +
ql−1
−l+1z−l+1 + · · · + q1
−1z−1. For z = reiφ ∈Σ, the logarithm of the
absolute value of e(q)(z) is equal to
r−l( Re(ql)

cos(lφ) + Im(ql)

sin(lφ) )+

CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
r−l+1( Re(ql−1)
−l + 1 cos((l −1)φ) + Im(ql−1)
−l + 1
sin((l −1)φ) ) + · · ·
The coeﬃcient of r−l is positive for φ = 0. One can take d > 0 small enough
such that the coeﬃcient of r−l is positive for all |φ| ≤d and 0 < c < 1 small
enough such that the function |e(q)(seiφ)| is for any ﬁxed |φ| ≤d a decreasing
function of s ∈(0, c]. With these preparations we deﬁne the operator K by
K(g)(z) = e(q)(z)
 z
0 e(−q)(t)g(t) dt
t . The integral makes sense, since e(−q)(t)
tends to zero for t ∈Σ and t →0. Clearly (δ −q)Kg = g and we are left with a
computation of ∥K(g)∥N. One can write K(g)(z) = e(q)(z)
 1
0 e(−q)(sz)g(sz) ds
s
and by the above choices one has |e(−q)(sz)| ≤|e(−q)(z)| for all s ∈[0, 1]. This
produces the estimate
 1
0 ∥g∥NsN|z|N ds
s = ∥g∥N
N |z|N. Thus K : F →F and K
is a contraction for ∥∥N with N ≥2.
2. Let ql = ip with p ∈R, p ̸= 0. We consider the case p < 0. The situation
p > 0 is treated in a similar way. For log |e(−q)(seiφ)| one has the formula
s−l( p
l sin(lφ) )+
s−l+1( Re(ql−1)
l −1
cos((l −1)φ) + Im(ql−1)
l −1
sin((l −1)φ) ) + · · ·
We can now choose small enough c, d > 0 such that
(a) The function s →|e(−q)(seid)| is increasing for s ∈[0, c].
(b) The function φ →|e(−q)(seiφ)| is for any any ﬁxed s, with 0 < s ≤c, a
decreasing function of φ ∈[−d, d].For every point z ∈Σ we take a path from 0 to
z = reiφ0, consisting of two pieces. The ﬁrst is the line segment {sreid|0 ≤s ≤
1} and the second one is the circle segment {reiφ|φ0 ≤φ ≤d}. The operator
K is deﬁned by letting K(g)(z) be the integral e(q)(z)

this path. It is clear that the integral is well deﬁned and that (δ −q)K(g) = g.
We have now to make an estimate for ∥K(g)∥N. The ﬁrst part of the path can
be estimated by
|e(q)(z)| |

Thus ∥K(g)∥N ≤( 1

K is a contraction with respect to ∥∥N.

3. First we take d small enough such that the coeﬃcient of r−l in the expression
for log |e(q)(reiφ)| is strictly negative for |φ| ≤d. Furthermore one can take
c > 0 small enough such that for any ﬁxed φ with |φ| ≤d, the function r →
|e(q)(reiφ)| is increasing on [0, c].
The operator K is deﬁned by letting K(g)(z) be the integral
e(q)(z)
 z

along any path in Σ from c to z.
It is clear that
(δ −q)K(g) = g. For z ∈Σ with |z| ≤c/2 and any integer M ≥1, one can
estimate |K(g)(z)| by
|e(q)(z)
 2z

e(−q)(t)g(t)dt

and this is bounded by |e(q)(z)e(q)(2z)−1| ∥g∥McM + |z|M∥g∥M 2M−1

. Since
the limit of |e(q)(z)e(q)(2z)−1|
|zM|
for |z| →0 is 0, one ﬁnds that there is some constant
CM with ∥K(g)∥M ≤CM∥g∥M. In particular K(g) ∈F. For the ﬁxed integer
N ≥1 we have to be more precise and show that for small enough c, d > 0 there
is an estimate ∥K(g)∥N ≤CN∥g∥N with CN < 1 (and for all g ∈F).
Set f(z) = e(q)(z)
zN
 z
c e(−q)(t)g(t) dt
t . We then want to show that |f(z)| ≤
C(c, d)∥g∥N for z ∈Σ, where C(c, d) is a constant which is < 1 for small enough
c, d > 0.
Let z
=
reiφ.
We split |f(z)| into two pieces.
The ﬁrst one is
| e(q)(reiφ)

e(−q)(t)g(t) dt

For the estimate of the ﬁrst integral we introduce the function E(t) := |e(q)(teiφ)|
and the ﬁrst integral is bounded by h(r)∥g∥N, where h(r) := E(r)
rN
 c
r E(t)−1tN dt
t .
We want to show that for small enough c > 0, one has h(r) ≤1/2 for all r with
0 < r ≤c.
For the boundary point r = c one has h(c) = 0. For the other boundary
point r = 0 we will show that the limit of h(r) for r →0 is zero. Take any
α > 1 and consider 0 < r with αr ≤c. Then h(r) = E(r)

The limit of E(r)E(αr)−1
rN
for r →0 is 0. Since α > 1 was arbitrary, this implies
that the limit of h(r) for r →0 is 0. The maximum value of h(r) is therefore
obtained for r0 ∈(0, c). The function h(r) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
rh′(r) = ( rE′(r)
E(r) −N)h(r) −1.
The expression log E(t) is equal to clt−l +
cl−1t−l+1 + · · · with cl < 0 and cl depending on φ. Thus h(r0) =

and this is, for small enough c, bounded by

CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
The function F is continuous and F(0) = 0. Therefore we can take d > 0 small
enough such that F(φ) ≤1/3 for all φ with |φ| ≤d. Thus the second part is
bounded by 1/3∥g∥N and ∥K(g)∥N ≤2/3∥g∥N.
2
We now recall the following deﬁnition (c.f., Deﬁnition 3.39)
Deﬁnition 7.15 A diﬀerential operator (δ −A), with A an n × n-matrix with
coeﬃcients in C({z}) is called split if it is equivalent, by a transformation in
GLn(C({z}) ), with a direct sum of operators of the form δ −q + C, where
q ∈z−1C[z−1] and C is a constant matrix.
The operator (δ −A) is called
quasi-split if it becomes split after replacing z by a suitable mth root of z.
2
Corollary 7.16 Let (δ −A) be a quasi-split linear diﬀerential operator of order
n and let d ∈S1 be a direction. Then (δ −A) acts surjectively on (A0
d)n and on
((A0
1/k)d)n for all k > 0.
Proof.
For the proof we may suppose that the operator is split and even that
it has the form δ −q +C where C is a constant matrix. Let T be a fundamental
matrix for the equation δy = Cy.
The equation (δ −q + C)f = g can be
rewritten as (δ −q)T f = T g. The transformation T induces a bijection on the
spaces (A0
d)n and ((A0
1/k)d)n. Thus we are reduced to proving that the operator
(δ −q) acts surjectively on A0
d and (A0
1/k)d. For d = 0 this follows at once from
Corollary 7.14.
2
The proof of Theorem 7.12 for the general case (and the direction 0) follows
from the next lemma.
Lemma 7.17 Let B be a n × n-matrix with entries in A0. Suppose that S =
J(B) has entries in C[z−1] and that δ −S is a quasi-split equation. Then there
exists an n × n matrix T with coeﬃcients in A0
0 such that (1 + T )−1(δ −B)(1 +
T ) = δ −S.
Indeed, consider (δ−A) and a formal transformation F ∈GLn(C((z)) ) such
that F −1(δ −A)F = (δ −S), where S has entries in C[z−1] and (δ −S) is quasi-
split. The existence of F and S is guaranteed by the classiﬁcation of diﬀerential
equations over C((z)), c.f., Proposition 3.41. Let ˜F ∈GLn(A0) satisfy J( ˜F ) =
F. Deﬁne the n × n-matrix B, with entries in A0, by (δ −B) = ˜F −1(δ −A) ˜F.
Since ˜F acts as a bijection on the spaces (A0
0)n and ((A0
1/k)0)n, it suﬃces to
consider the operator (δ −B) instead of (δ −A). By construction J(B) = S
and we can apply the above lemma. Also (1 + T ) acts as a bijection on the
spaces (A0
0)n and ((A0
1/k)0)n. Thus Lemma 7.17 and Corollary 7.16 complete
the proof of Theorem 7.12.
The Proof of Lemma 7.17
Using the arguments of the proof of Corollary 7.16, we may already suppose that

7.2. THE MAIN ASYMPTOTIC EXISTENCE THEOREM
205
S is a diagonal matrix diag(q1, . . . , qn) with the diagonal entries qi ∈z−1C[z−1].
We note that T itself is supposed to be a solution of the equation δ(T ) −ST +
T S = B −S + (B −S)T , having entries in A0
0.
The diﬀerential operator
L : T →δ(T ) −ST + T S acting on the space of the n × n-matrices is, on the
usual standard basis for matrices, also in diagonal form with diagonal entries
qi −qj ∈z−1C[z−1].
Take a suitable closed sector Σ = Σ(c, d) and consider the space M consisting
of the matrix functions z →M(z) satisfying:
(a) M(z) is continuous on Σ and holomorphic on the interior of Σ.
(b) For every integer N ≥1 there is a constant CN such that |M(z)| ≤CN|z|N
holds on Σ. Here |M(z)| denotes the l2-norm on matrices, given by |M(z)| :=
( |Mi,j(z)|2)1/2.
We note that for two matrices M1(z) and M2(z) one has |M1(z)M2(z)| ≤
|M1(z)|
|M2(z)|.
The space M has a sequence of norms ∥∥N, deﬁned by
∥M∥N := supz∈Σ
|M(z)|
|z|N . Using Lemma 7.13 and the diagonal form of L, one
ﬁnds that the operator L acts surjectively on M. Let us now ﬁx an integer
N0 ≥1. For small enough c, d > 0, Lemma 7.13 furthermore states there is a
linear operator K acting on M, which has the properties:
(1) LK is the identity and
(2) K is a contraction for ∥∥N0, i.e., ∥K(M)∥N0 ≤cN0∥M∥N0 with cN0 < 1
and all M ∈M
Deﬁne now a sequence of elements Tk ∈M by T0 = K(B −S) and Tk =
K((B −S)Tk−1) for k ≥1.
Since ∥B −S∥N < 1 for all integers N ≥1,
one can deduce from (2) that ∞
k=0 Tk converges uniformly on Σ to a matrix
function T which is continuous on Σ, holomorphic on the interior of Σ and
satisﬁes |T (z)| ≤D|z|N0 for a certain constant D > 0 and all z ∈Σ. Then
L(T ) = L(K(B −S)+K((B −S)T0)+· · · ) = (B −S)+(B −S)T . Thus we have
found a certain solution T for the equation δ(T )−ST +T S = (B−S)+(B−S)T .
We want to show that the element T belongs to M.
The element (B−S)(1+T ) belongs to M and thus L( K((B−S)(1+T )) ) = (B−
S)(1+T ). Therefore ˜T := T −K((B−S)(1+T )) satisﬁes L( ˜T) = 0 and moreover
˜T is continuous on Σ, holomorphic at the interior of Σ and | ˜T(z)| ≤DN|z|N0
holds for z ∈Σ and some constant DN0. From the diagonal form of L one
deduces that the kernel of L consists of the matrices diag(e(−q1), . . . , e(−qn)) ·
C·diag(e(q1), . . . , e(qn)) with C a constant matrix. The entries of ˜T are therefore
of the form ce(qi −qj) with c ∈C and satisfy inequalities ≤˜D|z|N0 for some
constant ˜D and our choice of N0 ≥1. Thus the non-zero entries of ˜T are in A0
0.
It follows that ˜T ∈M (again for c, d > 0 small enough) and thus T ∈M.

CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
7.3
The Inhomogeneous Equation of Order One
Let q ∈C[z−1] have degree k in the variable z−1. In this section we consider
the inhomogeneous equation
(δ −q) ˆf = g with g ∈C({z}) and ˆf ∈C((z)).
According to Theorem 7.10, there is for every direction d ∈S1 an asymptotic
lift of ˆf in A(a, b), with d ∈(a, b) and |b −a| “small enough”. The aim of this
section is to study the obstruction for the existence of an asymptotic lift on
large intervals (or sectors). As happens quite often, the obstruction from local
existence to global existence is measured by some cohomology group. In the
present situation, we will show that the obstruction is the ﬁrst cohomology
group of the sheaf ker(δ −q, A0). We refer to Appendix C for the deﬁnitions
and concepts from sheaf theory that we shall need.
Let U be a non-empty open subset of S1 (including the case U = S1). There is a
covering of U by “small” intervals Si, such that there exists for i an fi ∈A(Si)
with asymptotic expansion ˆf and (δ −q)fi = g. The diﬀerence fi −fj belongs
to ker(δ −q, A0)(Si ∩Sj). Hence the collection {gi,j} := {fi −fj} is a 1-cocycle
for the sheaf ker(δ −q, A0), since gi,j + gj,k + gk,i = 0 holds on the intersection
Si ∩Sj ∩Sk.
The image of this 1-cocycle in H1(U, ker(δ −q, A0)) is easily
seen to depend only on ˆf. Moreover, this image is zero if and only if ˆf has
an asymptotic lift on U. The practical point of this formalism is that we can
actually calculate the cohomology group H1(U, ker(δ −q, A0)), say for U = S1
or U an open interval.
Write q = q0 + q1z−1 + · · · + qkz−k with qk ̸= 0 and let e(q) := exp( q0 log z +
q1
−1z−1 + · · · + qk
−kz−k) be a “symbolic solution” of (δ −q)e(q) = 0. On a sector
S ̸= S1 one can give e(q) a meaning by choosing the function log z. For k = 0
one observes that ker(δ −q, A0) is zero. This implies that any formal solution
ˆf of (δ −q) ˆf = g ∈C({z}) has an asymptotic lift in A(S1) = C({z}). In other
words ˆf is in fact a convergent Laurent series.
From now on we will suppose that k > 0. We will introduce some terminology.
Deﬁnition 7.18 Let q = q0 + q1z−1 + · · · + qkz−k with qk ̸= 0 and k > 0 and
let e(q) := exp( q0 log z + q1
−1z−1 + · · · + qk
−kz−k). A Stokes direction d ∈S1 for
q is a direction such that Re( qk
−kz−k) = 0 for z = |z|eid. A Stokes pair is a pair
{d1, d2} of Stokes directions such that |d2 −d1| = π
k , i.e., d1, d2 are consecutive
Stokes directions. The Stokes pair {d1, d2} is called positive if Re( qk
−kz−k) > 0
for z with arg(z) ∈(d1, d2). The Stokes pair is called negative if Re( qk
−kz−k) < 0
for z with arg(z) ∈(d1, d2).
2
This terminology reﬂects the behaviour of |e(q)(z)| for small |z|. For d ∈(d1, d2),
where {d1, d2} is a positive Stokes pair, the function r →|e(q)(reid)| explodes

7.3. THE INHOMOGENEOUS EQUATION OF ORDER ONE
207
for r ∈R>0, r →0. If {d1, d2} is a negative Stokes pair, then the function
r →|e(q)(reid)| tends rapidly to zero for r ∈R>0, r →0. The asymptotic
behaviour of |e(q)(reid)| changes at the Stokes directions. The above notions
can be extended to a q, which is a ﬁnite sum of terms csz−s, with s ∈R≥0 and
cs ∈C. However in that case it is better to consider the directions d as elements
of R.
The sheaf ker(δ −q, A0) is a sheaf of vector spaces over C. For any interval
(a, b) where {a, b} is a negative Stokes pair, the restriction of ker(δ −q, A0) to
(a, b) is the constant sheaf with stalk C. For a direction d which does not lie in
such an interval the stalk of ker(δ −q, A0) is zero. One can see ker(δ −q, A0)
as a subsheaf of ker(δ −q, O) where O denotes the sheaf on S1 (of germs) of
holomorphic functions. If q0 ∈Z then ker(δ−q, O) is isomorphic to the constant
sheaf C on S1. If q0 ̸∈Z, then the restriction of ker(δ −q, O) to any proper
open subset of S1 is isomorphic to the constant sheaf. Thus ker(δ −q, A0) can
always be identiﬁed with the subsheaf F of the constant sheaf C determined by
its stalks Fd: equal to C if d lies in an open interval (a, b) with {a, b} a negative
Stokes pair, and 0 otherwise.
More generally, consider a proper open subset O ⊂S1 with complement F and
let i : F →S1 denote the inclusion. Let V be an abelian group (in our case this
will always be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C). Let V also denote the
constant sheaf on S1 with stalk V . Then there is a natural surjective morphism
of abelian sheaves V →i∗i∗V . The stalk (i∗i∗V )d is zero for d ∈O and for
d ̸∈O, the natural map (V )d →(i∗i∗V )d is a bijection. Write VF := i∗i∗V and
deﬁne the sheaf VO to be the kernel of V →VF = i∗i∗V . Then one can identify
ker(δ −q, A0) with CO, where O is the union of the k open intervals (ai, bi)
such that {ai, bi} are all the negative Stokes pairs. Clearly CO is the direct sum
of the sheaves C(ai,bi). We are therefore interested in calculating H1(U, CI),
with I an open interval and U either an open interval or S1. Consider the exact
sequence of sheaves
0 →VI →V →VF →0 on S1.
For the sheaf VF one knows that Hi(U, VF ) = Hi(U ∩F, V ) for all i ≥0. Thus
H0(U, VF ) ∼= V e, where e is the number of connected components of U ∩F,
and Hi(U, VF ) = 0 for all i ≥1 (c.f., the comments following Theorem C.27).
Consider any open subset U ⊂S1. The long exact sequence of cohomology
reads
0 →H0(U, VI) →H0(U, V ) →H0(U, VF ) →H1(U, VI) →H1(U, V ) →0
Lemma 7.19 Let the notation be as above with V = C. If U = S1 and for
U = (a, b) and the closure of I contained in U, then H1(U, CI) ∼= C. In all
other cases H1(U, CI) = 0.
Proof.
Let U = S1. We have that H0(S1, CI) = 0, H0(S1, C) ∼= H0(S1, CF ) ∼=

208
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
C (by the remarks preceeding the lemma) and H1(S1, C) ∼= C (by Example
C.22). Therefore the long exact sequence implies that H1(S1, CI) ∼= C.
Let U = (a, b) and assume that the closure of I is contained in U. We then
have that U ∩F has two components so H0(U, CF ) = H0(U ∩F, C) ∼= C ⊕C.
Furthermore, H0(U, CI) ∼= 0 and H0(U, C) ∼= C. Therefore H1(U, CI) ∼= C.
The remaining cases are treated similarly.
2
The following lemma easily follows from the preceeding lemma.
Lemma 7.20 Let U ⊂S1 be either an open interval (a, b) or S1.
Then
H1(U, ker(δ −q, A0)) = 0 if and only if U does not contain a negative Stokes
pair.
More generally, the dimension of H1(U, ker(δ −q, A0)) is equal to the
number of negative Stokes pairs contained in U. In particular, the dimension of
H1(S1, ker(δ −q, A0)) is k.
This lemma can be easily generalized to characterize H1(U, ker(δ −B, A0))
where δ −B is a quasi-split equation. We shall only need a weak form of this
which we state below.
We refer to Deﬁnition 3.28 for the deﬁnition of the
eigenvalue of a diﬀerential equation.
Corollary 7.21 Let U ⊂S1 be an open interval (a, b) and δ −B a quasi-split
diﬀerential operator. Then H1(U, ker(δ −B, A0)) = 0 if and only if U does not
contain a negative Stokes pair of some eigenvalue of δ −B.
Proof.
We may suppose that the operator is split and it is the sum of operators
of the form δ −q + C where C is a constant matrix. Therefore it is enough to
prove this result when the operator is of this form. Let T be a fundamental
matrix for the equation δy = Cy.
The map y →T y gives an isomorphism
of sheaves ker(δ −q, A0) and ker(δ −q + C, A0). The result now follows from
Lemma 7.20.
2
The map δ −q
is bijective on C((z)).
This follows easily from
(δ −q)zn = −qkzn−k + · · · for every integer n. Thus the obstruction for lifting
the unique formal solution ˆf of (δ −q) ˆf = g depends only on g ∈C({z}).
This produces the C-linear map β : C({z}) →H1(S1, ker(δ −q, A0)), which
associates to every g ∈C({z}) the obstruction β(g), for lifting ˆf to an element
of A(S1). From A(S1) = C({z}) it follows that the kernel of β is the image of
δ −q on C({z}).
Corollary 7.22 After a transformation (δ−˜q) = z−n(δ−q)zn, we may suppose
that 0 ≤Re(q0) < 1. The elements {β(zi)| i = 0, . . . , k −1} form a basis of
H1(S1, ker(δ −q, A0)).
In particular, β is surjective and one has an exact
sequence
0 →C({z})
δ−q
→C({z})
β→H1(S1, ker(δ −q, A0)) →0.

7.3. THE INHOMOGENEOUS EQUATION OF ORDER ONE
209
Proof.
According to Lemma 7.20 it suﬃces to show that the elements are
independent. In other words, we have to show that the existence of a y ∈C({z})
with (δ−q)y = a0+a1z+· · ·+ak−1zk−1 implies that all ai = 0. The equation has
only two singular points, namely 0 and ∞. Thus y has an analytic continuation
to all of C with at most a pole at 0. The singularity at ∞is regular singular.
Thus y has bounded growth at ∞, i.e., |y(z)| ≤C|z|N for |z| >> 0 and with
certain constants C, N and so y is in fact a rational function with at most poles
at 0 and ∞. Then y ∈C[z, z−1]. Suppose that y ̸= 0, then one can write
y = n1
i=n0 yizi with n0 ≤n1 and yn0 ̸= 0 ̸= yn1. The expression (δ −q)y ∈
C[z, z−1] is seen to be −qkyn0zn0−k + (n1 −q0)yn1zn1 + 
n0−k<i<n1 ∗zi. This
cannot be a polynomial in z of degree ≤k −1. This proves the ﬁrst part of the
corollary. The rest is an easy consequence.
2
We would like to show that the solution ˆf of (δ −q) ˆf = g is k-summable.
The next lemma gives an elementary proof of ˆf ∈C((z))1/k.
Lemma 7.23 The formal solution ˆf of (δ −q) ˆf = g lies in C((z))1/k. More
generally, δ −q is bijective on C((z))1/k.
Proof.
We give here an elementary proof depending on simple estimates.
Write ˆf =  cnzn and g = 
n gnzn.
For the coeﬃcients of ˆf one ﬁnds a
recurrence relation
cn+k = −qk−1
qk
cn+k−1 −· · · −q1
qk
cn+1 −q0 −n
qk
cn −1
qk
gn.
There exists a constant B > 0 with |gn| ≤Bn for n > 0. We must ﬁnd an
estimate of the form |cn| ≤AnΓ(1 + n
k ) for all n > 0 and some A > 0. We try
to prove by induction that
|cn|
AnΓ(1+ n
k ) ≤1, for a suitable A > 0 and all n > 0.
The induction step should follow from the bound for
|cn+k|
An+kΓ(1+ n+k
k
), given by
the recurrence relation. This bound is the expression
∗Γ(1 + n+k−1
k

AΓ(1 + n+k

Ak−1Γ(1 + n+k

+(∗+ n)Γ(1 + n

AkΓ(1 + n+k

∗Bn
An+kΓ(1 + n+k
k ),
where the ∗’s denote ﬁxed constants. From Γ(1 + n+k
k ) =
n+k
k Γ(1 + n
k ) one
easily deduces that a positive A can be found such that this expression is ≤1
for all n > 0. The surjectivity of δ −q follows by replacing the estimate Bn for
|gn| by BnΓ(1 + n
k ). The injectivity follows from the fact that δ −q is bijective
on C((z))1/k (see the discussion following Corollary 7.21).
2
For a direction d such that {d −π
2k, d + π
2k} is not a negative Stokes pair,
Lemma 7.20 produces an asymptotic lift in A(d −α
2 , d + α
2 ), for some α > π

CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
the formal solution ˆf of (δ −q) ˆf = g. This lift is easily seen to be unique. If we
can show that this lift is in fact a section of the subsheaf A1/k, then the proof
that ˆf is k-summable would be complete. In the next section we will develop
the necessary theory for the sheaf A1/k.
7.4
The Sheaves A, A0, A1/k, A0
1/k
We start by examining the sheaves A and A0.
Proposition 7.24 Consider the exact sequence of sheaves on S1:
0 →A0 →A →C((z)) →0,
where C((z)) denotes the constant sheaf on S1 with stalk C((z)).
1. For every open U ̸= S1 the cohomology group H1(U, . ) is zero for the
sheaves A0, A and C((z)).
2. The natural map H1(S1, A0) →H1(S1, A) is the zero map. As a conse-
quence, one has that
H1(S1, A)
∼
→H1(S1, C((z)) )
∼
→C((z)),
and there is an exact sequence
0 →C({z}) →C((z)) →H1(S1, A0) →0.
Proof.
We note that the circle has topological dimension one and for any
abelian sheaf F and any open U one has Hi(U, F) = 0 for i ≥2 (see Theo-
rem C.28). We want to show that for any open U ⊂S1 (including the case
U = S1), the map H1(U, A0) →H1(U, A) is the zero map. Assume that this is
true and consider the long exact sequence of cohomology:
0 →H0(U, A0) →H0(U, A) →H0(U, C((z))) →H1(U, A0)
→H1(U, A) →H1(U, C((z))) →0
If U ̸= S1, then the Borel-Ritt Theorem implies that the map H0(U, A) →
H0(U, C((z))) is surjective so the map H0(U, C((z))) →H1(U, A0) is the zero
map. Combining this with the fact that H1(U, A0) →H1(U, A) is the zero
map, we have that H1(U, A0) ∼= 0 and H1(U, A) ∼= H1(U, C((z))) ∼= 0. Since
each component of U is contractible (and so simply connected), Theorem C.27
implies that H1(U, C((z))) ∼= 0 and 1. follows. If U = S1 then H0(U, A) ∼=
C((z)) and H0(U, C((z))) ∼= H1(U, C((z))) ∼= C((z)) (c.f., Exercise C.22). Since
H1(U, A0) →H1(U, A) is the zero map, 2. follows from the long exact sequence
as well.

THE SHEAVES A, A0, A1/k, A0

We start by considering the most simple covering: U = (a1, b1) ∪(a2, b2)
with (a1, b1) ∩(a2, b2) = (a2, b1), i.e., inequalities a1 < a2 < b1 < b2 for the
directions on S1 and U ̸= S1. A 1-cocycle for A0 and this covering is given
by a single element f ∈A0(a2, b1). Take a small positive ϵ such that (a1, b1 −
ϵ) ∪(a2 + ϵ, b2) = U and consider the integral
1
2πi

γ
f(ζ)
ζ−z dζ, where the path γ
consists of three pieces γi for i = 1, 2, 3. The path γ1 is the line segment from 0
to rei(a2+ϵ/2), γ2 is the circle segment from rei(a2+ϵ/2) to rei(b1−ϵ/2) and γ3 is the
line segment from rei(b1−ϵ/2) to 0. The r > 0 is adapted to the size of the sector
where f lives. We conclude that for z with |z| < r and arg(z) ∈(a2 + ϵ, b1 −ϵ)
this integral is equal to f(z). The path is divided into two pieces γ+, which is
γ1 and the ﬁrst half of γ2 and the remaining part γ−. The integral over the two
pieces will be called f+(z) and −f−(z). We will show that f+ ∈A(a2 + ϵ, b2)
and f−∈A(a1, b1 −ϵ). From this it follows that our 1-cocycle for A0 has image
0 in H1(U, A).
By symmetry, it suﬃces to prove the statement for f+. This function lives
in fact on the open sector V := S1 \ {a2 + ϵ/2} (and say |z| < r). The func-
tion f(ζ)
ζ−z can be developed as power series in z, namely 
n≥0 f(ζ)ζ−1−nzn.
We consider the formal power series ˆF = 
n≥0( 1
2πi

γ+ f(ζ)ζ−1−ndζ) zn and
want to prove that f+ has asymptotic expansion ˆF on the open sector V .
From
1
1−z/ζ = 1−(z/ζ)N
1−z/ζ
+ (z/ζ)N
1−z/ζ , one concludes that the diﬀerence of f+ and


γ+ f(ζ)ζ−1−ndζ

2πi

ζ(1−z/ζ) dζ. For any
closed subsector W of V one has infz∈W |1−z/ζ| is strictly positive. By assump-
tion, there are constants CN+1 such that |f(ζ)| ≤CN+1|ζ|N+1 for all N > 0.
One concludes that the last integral is bounded by DN|z|N for some constant
DN.
The next case that we consider is a covering (a1, b1), (a2, b2) of S1.
The
intersection (a1, b1) ∩(a2, b2) is supposed to have two components (a2, b1) and
(a1, b2). Let the 1-cocycle be given by f ∈A0(a2, b1) and 0 ∈A0(a1, b2). Deﬁne
f+ ∈A(a2 + ϵ, b2) and f−∈A(a1, b1 −ϵ) as in the ﬁrst case. Then f+ −f−
coincides with f on (a2 + ϵ, b1 −ϵ) and is zero on (a1, b2).
The following case is a “ﬁnite special covering” of U, which is either an
open interval or S1.
We will deﬁne this by giving a sequence of directions
d1 < d2 < · · · < dn in U and intervals (di −ϵ, di+1 + ϵ) with small ϵ > 0. In
the case U = S1, the interval (dn −ϵ, d1 + ϵ) is also present. A 1-cocycle ξ is
given by a sequence of functions fi ∈A0(di −ϵ, di + ϵ). One writes ξ as a sum
of 1-cocycles ζ which have only one non zero fi. It suﬃces to show that such
a ζ is a trivial 1-cocycle for the sheaf A. This follows from the ﬁrst two cases,
since one can see ζ also a a 1-cocycle for a covering of U by two open intervals.
Every covering of S1 and every ﬁnite covering of an open interval U can be
reﬁned to a ﬁnite special covering. We are left with studying inﬁnite coverings
of an open interval U =: (a, b). Any inﬁnite covering can be reﬁned to what we
will call a “special inﬁnite covering” of U. The latter is deﬁned by a sequence

212
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
dn, n ∈Z of points in U, such that di < di+1 for all i. Moreover ∪[di, di+1] = U.
The covering of U by the closed intervals is replaced by a covering with open
intervals (d−
i , d+
i+1), where d−
i < di < d+
i and |d+
i −d−
i | very small. A cocycle
ξ is again given by elements fi ∈A0(d−
i , d+
i ). Using the argument above, one
can write fi = gi −hi with gi and hi sections of the sheaf A above, say, the
intervals (a, (di + d+
i )/2) and ((d−
i + di)/2, b).
Deﬁne, ﬁrst formally, Fi :=

j≥i gj −
j≤i hj as function on the interval ((d−
i + di)/2, (d+
i+1 + di+1)/2).
Then clearly Fi −Fi−1 = gi −hi = fi on ((d−
i + di)/2, (d+
i + di)/2). There is
still one thing to prove, namely that the inﬁnite sums appearing in Fi converge
to a section of A on the given interval. This can be done using estimates on
the integrals deﬁning the gi and hi given above. We will skip the proof of this
statement.

Remarks 7.25 1.
The calculation of the cohomology of ker(δ −q, A0) and
ker(δ −A, A0) was initiated by Malgrange [187] and Deligne and further devel-
oped by Loday-Richaud, Malgrange, Ramis and Sibuya (c.f. [13], [179], [194]).
2.
The ﬁrst statement of Proposition 7.24.2 is sometimes referred to as the
Cauchy-Heine Theorem (c.f.
[194], Theorem 1.3.2.1.i and ii).
However, the
name “Heine’s Theorem” seems more appropriate.

Lemma 7.26 The Borel-Ritt Theorem for C((z))1/k
Suppose that k > 1/2.
Then the map J : A1/k(a, b) →C((z))1/k is surjective if |b −a| ≤π
k .
Proof.
After replacing z by eidz1/k for a suitable d we have to prove that the
map J : A1(−π, π) →C((z))1 is surjective. It suﬃces to show that an element
ˆf = 
n≥1 cnn!zn with |cn| ≤(2r)−n for some positive r is in the image of J.
One could reﬁne Proposition 7.3 to prove this. A more systematic procedure
is the following. For any half line γ, of the form {seid|s ≥0} and |d| < π one
has n! =

γ ζnexp(−ζ)dζ. Thus for z ̸= 0 and arg(z) ∈(−π, π) one has n!zn =
 ∞
0
ζnexp(−ζ
z)d( ζ
z), where the path of integration is the positive real line. This
integral is written as a sum of two parts F(n, r)(z) =
 r
0 ζnexp(−ζ
z)d( ζ
z) and
R(n, r)(z) =
 ∞
r
ζnexp(−ζ
z)d( ζ
z). The claim is that F(z) := 
n≥1 cnF(n, r)(z)
converges locally uniformly on {z ∈C| z ̸= 0}, belongs to A1(−π, π) and
satisﬁes J(F) = ˆf.
The integral
 r
0 (
n≥1 cnζn)exp(−ζ
z)d( ζ
z), taken over the closed interval
[0, r] ⊂R, exists for all z ̸= 0 since 
n≥1 cnζn has radius of convergence
2r.
Interchanging  and  proves the ﬁrst statement on F.
To prove the
other two statements we have to give for every closed subsector of {z ∈C| 0 <
|z| and arg(z) ∈(−π, π)} an estimate of the form E := |F(z)−N−1
n=1 cnn!zn| ≤
ANN!|z|N for some positive A, all N ≥1 and all z in the closed sector.
Now E ≤N−1

Now r−N + N−1

ζN|exp(−ζ

|z|. For z = |z|eiθ one has |exp(−ζ

exp(−ζ
|z| cos θ). The integral is easily computed to be
|z|N
(cos θ)N+1N!. This gives
the required estimate for E.
2
For k > 1/2, the function exp(−z−k) belongs to A0
1/k(−π
2k, π
2k). The next
lemma states that this is an extremal situation. For sectors with larger “open-
ing” the sheaf A0
1/k has only the zero section. This important fact, Watson’s
Lemma, provides the uniqueness for k-summation in a given direction.
Lemma 7.27 Watson’s Lemma. A0
1/k(a, b) = 0 if |b −a| > π
k .
Proof.
After replacing z by z1/keid for a suitable d the statement reduces
to A0
1(−α, α) = 0 for α >
π
2 .
We will prove the following slightly stronger
statement (c.f., Lemma 7.5):
Let S denote the open sector given by the inequalities | arg(z)| < π
2 and 0 < |z| <
r. Suppose that f is holomorphic on S and that there are positive constants A, B
such that |f(z)| ≤A exp(−B|z|−1) holds for all z ∈S. Then f = 0.
We start by choosing M > B and ϵ > 0 and deﬁning β by 0 < β < π
2 such that
cos β =
B
M and δ > 0 by (1 + δ)β < π
2 and cos((1 + δ)β) =
B
2M . Deﬁne the
function F(z), depending on M and ϵ, by F(z) := f(z) exp(−ϵz−1−δ + Mz−1).
Let ˜S denote the closed sector given by the inequalities | arg(z)| ≤β and 0 <
|z| ≤r/2.
The limit of F(z) for z →0 and z ∈˜S is 0 and thus F(z) is bounded on ˜S.
According to the maximum principle, the maximum of |F(z)| is assumed at the
boundary of ˜S. For 0 < |z| ≤r/2 and arg(z) = β one can bound |F(z)| by
≤A exp(−B|z|−1) exp(−ϵ|z|−1−δ cos((1 + δ)β) + M|z|−1 cos(β)) ≤A.
For the boundary 0 < |z| ≤r/2 and arg(z) = −β one ﬁnds the same esti-
mate. For z with | arg(z)| ≤β and |z| = r/2, one ﬁnds the estimate |F(z)| ≤
A exp((M −B)(r/2)−1).
We conclude that for any z ∈˜S the inequality
|F(z)| ≤A exp((M −B)(r/2)−1) holds. Thus we ﬁnd for z ∈˜S the inequality
|f(z)| ≤A exp((M −B)(r/2)−1) |exp(−Mz−1)| |exp(+ϵz−1−δ)|.
Since ϵ > 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that also
|f(z)| ≤A exp(−B(r/2)−1) |exp(M((r/2)−1 −z−1))|

214
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
holds for all z ∈˜S. For a ﬁxed z with | arg(z)| < π
2 and small enough |z| > 0
such that Re((r/2)−1 −z−1) < 0, this inequality holds for all suﬃciently large
M. Since |exp(M((r/2)−1 −z−1)| tends to 0 for M →∞, we conclude that
f(z) = 0.

Proposition 7.28
1. The following sequence of sheaves on S1 is exact.
0 →A0
1/k →A1/k →C((z))1/k →0
2. For every open U ⊂S1, including U = S1, the canonical map
H1(U, A0
1/k) →H1(U, A1/k) is the zero map.
3. H1(U, A1/k) is zero for U ̸= S1 and equal to C((z))1/k for U = S1.
4. H1((a, b), A0
1/k) = 0 for |b −a| ≤π
k .
5. For (a, b) with |b −a| > π
k , the following sequence is exact.
0 →A1/k(a, b) →C((z))1/k →H1((a, b), A0
1/k) →0
6. The following sequence is exact.
0 →C({z}) →C((z))1/k →H1(S1, A0
1/k) →0
7. There is a canonical isomorphism C((z))1/k →H0(S1, A/A0
1/k).
Proof.
1. follows from Lemma 7.26. The proof of part 2. of Proposition 7.24
extends to a proof of part 2. of the present proposition. One only has to verify
that the functions f+ and f−are now sections of the sheaf A1/k. Furthermore
3.,4.,5., and 6. are immediate consequences of 1., 2., the known cohomology
of the constant sheaf C((z))1/k, Lemma 7.27 and the long exact sequence of
cohomology. We identify the constant sheaf C((z))1/k with A1/k/A0
1/k. Thus
there is an exact sequence of sheaves
0 →C((z))1/k →A/A0
1/k →A/A1/k →0
Taking sections above S1 we ﬁnd an exact sequence
0 →C((z))1/k →H0(S1, A/A0
1/k) →H0(S1, A/A1/k)
(7.1)
The exact sequence
0 →A1/k →A →A/A1/k →0
induces the long exact sequence of cohomology above S1:
0 →C({z}) →C({z}) →H0(S1, A/A1/k) →C((z))1/k →C((z)) · · ·
This implies H0(S1, A/A1/k) = 0 and so, from the sequence (7.1), we conclude
7.

7.5. THE EQUATION (δ −Q) ˆF = G REVISITED
215
Remark 7.29 Proposition 7.28.2 is the Ramis-Sibuya Theorem (see [194], The-
orem 2.1.4.2 and Corollaries 2.1.4.3 and 2.1.4.4).
7.5
The Equation (δ −q) ˆf = g Revisited
Some of the results of Section 7.3 can be established using the methods of Section
7.4.
Exercise 7.30 Give an alternative proof of the surjectivity of β : C({z}) →
H1(S1, ker(δ −q, A0)) (see Corollary 7.22) by using Proposition 7.24.
Hint:
An element ξ ∈H1(S1, ker(δ −q, A0)) induces an element of H1(S1, A0). By
Proposition 7.24.2, this element is zero in H1(S1, A) so for some covering {Si}
of S1, there exist fi ∈H0(Si, A) such that fi −fj = ξi,j, where ξi,j is a
representative of ξ on Si ∩Sj. Show that the (δ −q)fi glue together to give an
element g ∈H0(S1, A) = C({x}) and that the fi are lifts of some ˆf ∈C((x))
such that (δ −q) ˆf = g.
2
Exercise 7.31 Give an alternative proof of the fact that (δ−q) ˆf = g ∈C({z})
implies ˆf ∈C((z))1/k (see Lemma 7.23) by using the last statement of Propo-
sition 7.28. Hint: g maps to an element β(g) ∈H1(S1, ker(δ −q, A0)). Observe
that ker((δ −q), A0) = ker(δ −q, A0
1/k). Thus ˆf can be seen as an element of
H0(S1, A/A0
1/k).
2
Proposition 7.32 The element ˆf ∈C((z)) satisfying (δ−q) ˆf = g ∈C({z|}) is
k-summable. More precisely, ˆf is k-summable in the direction d if {d−π
2k, d+ π
2k}
is not a negative Stokes pair.
Proof.
We know by Lemma 7.23, or by Exercise 7.31, that ˆf ∈C((z))1/k.
Take a direction d. By Proposition 7.28 there is an h ∈(A1/k)d with J(h) = ˆf.
Clearly (δ −q)h −g = g0 ∈(A0
1/k)d. By Theorem 7.12 there is an h0 ∈(A0
1/k)d
with (δ −q)h0 = g0 and thus (δ −q)(h −h0) = g. In other words, the formal
solution ˆf lifts for small enough sectors S to a solution in A1/k(S) of the same
equation. This yields a 1-cocycle in the sheaf ker(δ −q, A0
1/k) = ker(δ −q, A0).
This 1-cocycle is trivial for an open interval (d −π
2k −ϵ, d + π
2k + ϵ) (for some
positive ϵ) when {d−π
2k, d+ π
2k} is not a negative Stokes pair (see Lemma 7.20).
2
Deﬁnition 7.33 Consider q = qkz−k + qk−1z−k+1 + · · · + q1z−1 ∈z−1C[z−1]
with qk ̸= 0. A direction d will be called singular for q (or for the operator δ−q)
if qke−idk is a positive real number.
2
One immediately sees that d is a singular direction for δ −q if and only if {d −
π
2k, d+ π
2k} is a negative Stokes pair. Thus one can reformulate Proposition 7.32
by saying that ˆf is k-summable in the direction d if d is not a singular direction.

CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
7.6
The Laplace and Borel Transforms
The formal Borel transformation ˆBk of order k is the operator C[[z]] →C[[ζ]]
deﬁned by the formula
ˆBk(

n≥0
cnzn) =

n≥0
cn
Γ(1 + n
k )ζn.
The Laplace transform Lk,d of order k in the direction d is deﬁned by the formula
(Lk,df)(z) =

d
f(ζ)exp(−(ζ
z )k) d(ζ
z )k.
The path of integration is the half line through 0 with direction d. The function
f is supposed to be deﬁned and continuous on this half line and have a suitable
behaviour at 0 and ∞in order to make this integral convergent for z in some
sector at 0, that is, |f(ζ)| ≤AeB|z|k for positive constants A, B.
We note
that we have slightly deviated from the usual formulas for the formal Borel
transformation and the Laplace transformation (although these agree with the
deﬁnitions in [15]).
A straightforward calculation shows that the operator Lk,d ◦ˆBk has the
property Lk,d ◦ˆBk(zn) = zn for any n ≥0 and more generally Lk,d ◦ˆBkf = f
for any f ∈C{z}.
Suppose now that ˆf ∈C[[z]]1/k.
Then ( ˆBk ˆf)(ζ) is by
deﬁnition a convergent power series at ζ = 0. One can try to apply Lk,d to
this function in order to obtain an asymptotic lift of ˆf to some sector. The
following theorem makes this precise. We deﬁne a function, analytic in a sector
{ζ ∈C| 0 < |ζ| < ∞and | arg(ζ) −d| < ϵ}, to have exponential growth of order
≤k at ∞if there are constants A, B such that |h(ζ)| ≤A exp( B|ζ|k) holds for
large |ζ| and | arg(ζ) −d| < ϵ.
Theorem 7.34 Let ˆf ∈C[[z]]1/k and let d be a direction. Then the following
are equivalent:
1. ˆf is k-summable in the direction d.
2. The convergent power series ˆBk ˆf has an analytic continuation h in a full
sector {ζ ∈C| 0 < |ζ| < ∞and | arg(ζ) −d| < ϵ}. In addition, this
analytic continuation has exponential growth of order ≤k at ∞on this
sector.
Proof.
We give here a sketch of the proof and refer to ([15], Ch. 3.1) for the
missing details concerning the estimates that we will need. We may suppose
k = 1 and d = 0. Write ˆf = 
n≥0 cnzn. We will start by proving that 2.
implies 1. Let d be a direction with |d| < ϵ. The integral
f(z) := (L1,dh)(z) =

d
h(ζ)exp(−ζ
z )d(ζ
z )

7.6. THE LAPLACE AND BOREL TRANSFORMS
217
converges for z ̸= 0 with |z| small enough and | arg(z) −d| < π
2 . Moreover this
integral is analytic and does not depend on the choice of d. Thus f is an analytic
function on a sector (−π
2 −ϵ, π
2 + ϵ). Write h(ζ) = N−1
i=0
ci
i! ζi + hN(ζ). Then
f(z) = N−1
i=0 cizi + (L1,dhN)(z). One can show (but we will not give details)
that there exists a constant A > 0, independent of N, such that the estimate
|(L1,dhN)(z)| ≤ANN!|z|N holds. In other words, f lies in A1(−π
2 −ϵ, π
2 + ϵ)
and has asymptotic expansion ˆf.
Suppose now that 1. holds and let f ∈A1(−π
2 −ϵ, π
2 + ϵ) have asymptotic
expansion ˆf. Then we will consider the integral
h(ζ) := (B1f)(ζ) =

λ
f(z)z exp(ζ
z ) dz−1
over the contour λ, which consists of the three parts {sei(−π+ϵ
2
)| 0 ≤s ≤r},
{reid| −π+ϵ
2
≤d ≤π+ϵ
2 } and {sei(+ π+ϵ
2
)| r ≥s ≥0}.
For ζ with 0 < |ζ| < ∞and | arg(ζ)| < ϵ/4 this integral converges and is
an analytic function of ζ. It is easily veriﬁed that h has exponential growth of
order ≤1. The integral transform B1 is called the Borel transform of order 1. It
is easily seen that for f = zn the Borel transform B1(f) is equal to ζn
n! . We write
now f = N−1
i=0 cizi + fN. Then |fN(z)| ≤ANN!|z|N holds for some constant
A > 0, independent of N. Then h(ζ) = N−1
i=0
ci
i! ζi +B1(fN)(ζ). One can prove
(but we will not give details) an estimate of the form |B1(fN)(ζ)| ≤AN|ζN| for
small enough |ζ|. Using this one can identify the above h for ζ with |ζ| small
and | arg(ζ)| < ϵ/4 with the function ˆB1 ˆf. In other words, ˆB1 ˆf has an analytic
continuation, in a full sector {ζ ∈C| 0 < |ζ| < ∞and | arg(ζ)| < ϵ/4}, which
has exponential growth of order ≤1.
2
Remarks 7.35 1. In general one can deﬁne the Borel transform of order k in
the direction d in the following way. Let d be a direction and let S be a sector
of them for {z | |z| < R, | arg(z) −d| < ρ} where ρ >
π
2k. Let f be analytic in
S and bounded at 0. We then deﬁne the Borel transform of f of order k in the
direction d to be
(Bkf)(ζ) :=

λ
f(z)zkexp(ζk
zk )d(z−k)
where λ is a suitable wedge shaped path in S and ζ lies in the interior of this
path (see [15], Ch. 2.3 for the details). The function Bkf can be shown to be
analytic in the sector {ζ | |ζ| < ∞, | arg(ζ) −d| < ρ −
π
2k}.
Furthermore,
applying B to each term of a formal power series ˆf =  cnzn yields ˆB ˆf.
2. The analytic way to prove the k-summation theorem for a solution ˆv of an
equation (δ−A)ˆv = w, which has only k > 0 as positive slope, consists of a rather
involved proof that ˆBkˆv satisﬁes part 2. of Theorem 7.34. The equivalence with
1. yields then the k-summability of ˆv. In our treatment of the k-summation

218
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
theorem (and the multisummation theorem later on) the basic ingredient is the
cohomology of the sheaf ker(δ −A, (A0)n) and the Main Asymptotic Existence
Theorem.
2
We illustrate this theorem with an example of the type (δ −q)ˆv = w, which
is chosen such that ˆBkˆv can actually be calculated. This example also produces
for the image of ˆv in the cohomology group H1(U, ker(δ−q, A0)) of Lemma 7.20,
an explicit 1-cocycle by the Laplace and Borel method.
Example 7.36 The equation (δ −kz−k + k)ˆv = w with w ∈C[z, z−1].
Write ˆv ∈C((z)) as  vnzn. Then for n >> 0 one ﬁnds the relation vn+k =
n+k
k vn. Thus for n >> 0 one has vn = aiΓ(1 + n
k ), where the constant ai only
depends on n modulo k. In other words the possibilities for ˆv are
p + k−1
i=0 ai

n≥0 Γ(1 + nk+i
k
)znk+i with p ∈C[z, z−1] and a0, . . . , ak−1 ∈C.
It suﬃces to consider ˆv with p = 0, and thus
(δ −kz−k + k)ˆv =
k−1

i=0
−aikΓ(1 + i
k )z−k+i.
The formal Borel transform Bkˆv is equal to f :=
a0+a1ζ+···+ak−1ζk−1
1−ζk
.
The
radius of convergence of f is 1 (if ˆv ̸= 0).
For any direction d, not in the
set { 2πj
k |j = 0, . . . , k −1}, the function f has a suitable analytic continuation
on the half line d.
Consider a direction d with 0 < d <
2π
k .
The integral
v(z) := (Lk,df)(z) =

d f(ζ)exp(−( ζ
z )k) d( ζ
z)k is easily seen to be an analytic
function of z for z ̸= 0 and arg( ζ
z)k ∈(−π
2 , π
2 ). Thus v is analytic for z ̸= 0
and arg(z) ∈(d −
π
2k, d +
π
2k). Moreover v does not depend on d, as long as
d ∈(0, 2π
k ). Thus we conclude that v is a holomorphic function on the sector,
deﬁned by the relation arg(z) ∈(−π
2k, 2π
k + π
2k).
Exercise 7.37 Prove that the above v lies in A1/k(−π
2k, 2π
k +

2k) and has
asymptotic expansion ˆv. Hint: Subtract from f(ζ) a truncation of its Taylor
series at ζ = 0.
2
Let w be the Laplace transform Lk,df for d ∈(−2π
k , 0). Then by the Cauchy
Residue Formula one has that
(v −w)(z) = −2πi Resζ=1(f(ζ)exp(−(ζ
z )k) d(ζ
z )k)
= 2πi (a0 + a1 + · · · + ak−1)h,
in which the function h := z−kexp(−z−k) is a solution of (δ −kz−k + k)h =
0. More generally consider a direction dj :=
2πj
k
and let d+
j and d−
j denote
directions of the form dj ±ϵ for small ϵ > 0. Let vj+ and vj−denote the Laplace
integrals Lk,dj+ f and Lk,dj−f. Then one has the formula
(vj+ −vj−)(z) = 2πi (a0 + a1ζ + · · · + ak−1ζk−1)h with ζ = e2πij/k.

7.7. THE K-SUMMATION THEOREM
219
We compare this with Section 7.3. The directions 2πj
k
are the singular directions
for δ −kz−k + k. The negative Stokes pairs are the pairs { 2πj
k −π
2k, 2πj
k + π
2k}.
The Laplace-Borel method produces the asymptotic lifts of ˆv on the maximal
intervals, i.e. the maximal intervals not containing a negative Stokes pair. Con-
sider, as in Section 7.3, the map β : C({z}) →H1(S1, ker(δ −kz−k + k, A0)),
which associates to each w ∈C({z}) the image in H1(S1, ker(δ −kz−k +k, A0))
of the unique formal solution ˆv of (δ −kz−k + k)ˆv = w. For w of the form
k−1
i=0 biz−k+i the above residues give the explicit 1-cocycle for β(w).
Exercise 7.38 Extend the above example and the formulas to the case of a
formal solution ˆv of (δ −kz−k + k)ˆv = w with w =  wnzn ∈C({z}). In
particular, give an explicit formula for the 1-cocycle β(w) and ﬁnd the conditions
on the coeﬃcients wn of w which are necessary and suﬃcient for ˆv to lie in
C({z}).
2
7.7
The k-Summation Theorem
This theorem can be formulated as follows. The notion of eigenvalue of a dif-
ferential equation is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.28.
Theorem 7.39 Consider a formal solution ˆv of the inhomogeneous matrix
equation (δ −A)ˆv = w, where w and A have coordinates in C({z}) and such
that the only positive slope of δ −A is k. Then ˆv is k-summable (i.e., every
coordinate of ˆv is k-summable). Let q1, . . . , qs denote the distinct eigenvalues of
δ −A. Then ˆv is k-summable in the direction d if d is not singular for any of
the q1, . . . , qs.
We note that the qi are in fact polynomials in z−1/m for some integer m ≥1.
The set of singular directions of a single qi may not be well deﬁned.
The
set {q1, . . . , qs} is invariant under the action on C[z−1/m], given by z−1/m →
e−2πi/mz−1/m. Thus the set of the singular directions of all qi is well deﬁned.
We start the proof of Theorem 7.39 with a lemma.
Lemma 7.40 Let ˆv be a formal solution of (δ −A)ˆv = w, where A and w have
coordinates in C({z}) and let k > 0 be the smallest positive slope of δ −A. For
every direction d there is an asymptotic lift vd of ˆv with coordinates in (A1/k)d.
Proof.
We will follow to a great extend the proof of Proposition 7.32. There
exists a quasi-split equation (δ −B) which is formally equivalent to (δ −A),
i.e., ˆF −1(δ −A) ˆF = (δ −B) and ˆF ∈GLn(C((z))). The equation (δ −B) is
a direct sum of (δ −qi −Ci), where q1, . . . , qs are the distinct eigenvalues and
the Ci are constant matrices. After replacing z by a root z1/m, we are in the
situation that k > 0 is an integer. Furthermore, we can use the method of
Corollary 7.16 to reduce to the case where all the Ci are 0. The assumption

220
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
that k is the smallest positive slope is equivalent to: if qi is ̸= 0 then the
degree of qi in z−1 is ≥k.
Let d be a direction.
By Theorem 7.10, there
is an Fd ∈GLn(Ad) with J(Fd) = ˆF and F −1
d (δ −A)Fd = (δ −B). Since
ker(δ −qi, A0
d) = ker(δ −qi, (A0
1/k)d), the kernel ker(δ −B, ((A0)d)n) lies in
((A0
1/k)d)n. Since Fd acts bijectively on ((A0
1/k)d)n, one also has that the kernel
of δ −A on ((A0)d)n lies in ((A0
1/k)d)n. The element ˆv has an asymptotic lift in
((A)d)n, which is determined modulo the kernel of (δ −A) and thus deﬁnes a
unique element of ((A/A0
1/k)d)n. By gluing one ﬁnds a global section, i.e., over
S1, of the corresponding sheaf. The last statement of Proposition 7.28 implies
that the coordinates of ˆv are in C((z))1/k. For a direction d one can ﬁrst lift
ˆv to an element of ((A1/k)d)n and then, using Theorem 7.12, we conclude that
there is a lift vd ∈((A1/k)d)n satisfying the equation (δ −A)vd = w.
2
The obstruction to lifting ˆv to a solution of the equation with coordinates in
((A1/k)(a, b))n is given by a 1-cocycle with image in the group H1((a, b), ker(δ−
A, (A0
1/k)n) ). The theorem will now follow from the known cohomology of the
sheaf KB := ker(δ −B, (A0
1/k)n) ) (see Lemma 7.20), and the construction
in the next lemma of an isomorphism between restrictions of the two sheaves
KA := ker(δ −A, (A0
1/k)n) ) and KB to suitable open intervals (a, b).
Lemma 7.41 Suppose that d is not a singular direction for any of the qi, then
for some positive ϵ the restrictions of the sheaves KA and KB to the open interval
(d −π
2k −ϵ, d + π
2k + ϵ) are isomorphic.
Proof.
We may suppose that the qi are polynomials in z−1. As before δ −A
is formally equivalent to δ −B, which is a direct sum of δ −qi + Ci and we
may suppose that the Ci are 0. Let f be any direction. The formal ˆF with
ˆF −1(δ −A) ˆF = (δ −B) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation δ( ˆF) = A ˆF −ˆFB.
By Theorem 7.10, ˆF lifts to an Ff ∈GLn(Af) with F −1
f
(δ −A)Ff = (δ −B).
This produces locally at the direction f an isomorphism (KA)f →(KB)f. The
asymptotic lift Ff is not unique. Two asymptotic lifts diﬀer by a G ∈GLn(Af)
with J(G) = 1 and G−1(δ −B)G = (δ −B). We have to investigate KB and
the action of G on KB in detail.
We note that KB is the direct sum of KB(i) := ker(δ −qi, (A0
1/k)ni) over all non
zero qi. The action of G on (KB)f has the form 1+
i̸=j li,j, where 1 denotes the
identity and li,j ∈HomC(KB(i), KB(j))f. For any p = plz−l + · · · ∈z−1C[z−1]
with pl ̸= 0, we will call the direction f ﬂat if Re(ple−ifl) > 0. With this
terminology one has: li,j can only be non zero if the direction f is ﬂat for qi −qj
(and f is of course also a ﬂat direction for qi and qj).
Let us call S the sheaf of all the automorphisms of KB, deﬁned by the above con-
ditions. The obstruction for constructing an isomorphism between the restric-
tions of KA and KB to (a, b) is an element of the cohomology set H1((a, b), S).
We will show that this cohomology set is trivial, i.e., it is just one element, for

THE k-SUMMATION THEOREM
221
(a, b) = (d −π
2k −ϵ, d + π
2k + ϵ) with small ϵ > 0 and d not a singular direction.
Although S is a sheaf of non abelian groups, it is very close to sheaves of abelian
groups.For any direction f, deﬁne qi <f qj if f is a ﬂat direction for qi −qj.
Lemma 7.42 Let S be as above.
1. For any f ∈S1, every element of the stalk Sf is unipotent.
2. There exists a ﬁnite sequence of subsheaves subsheaves S(r) of S, given by
1 +  lj1,j2 belongs to S(r)f if lj1,j2 ̸= 0 implies that there are s1, . . . , sr
with qj1 <f qs1 <f · · · <f qsr <f qj2.
Proof.
1. Let G = I + N ∈Sf where N = (li,j). As noted above, if li,j ̸= 0
then qi < qj. For any r ≥0 let N r = (li,j,r). One shows by induction that if
li,j,r ̸= 0, then there exist s1, . . . , sr−1 such that qi <f qs1 <f · · · <f qsr−1 <f qj.
Therefore N r = 0 for suﬃciently large r.
2. We deﬁne a sequence of subsheaves S(r) of S, given by 1 +  lj1,j2 belongs
to S(r)f if lj1,j2 ̸= 0 implies that there are s1, . . . , sr with qj1 <f qs1 <f · · · <f
qsr <f qj2. The quotients sheaves S/S(1), . . . , S(i)/S(i + 1), . . . are easily seen
to be abelian sheaves.
We now use the notation introduced in Section 7.3
before Lemma 7.19. Each quotient is a direct sum of sheaves HH, where H :=
HomC(KB(j1), KB(j2)) and H is the open interval consisting of the directions
g which are ﬂat for qj1 −qj2 (and for certain pairs j1 ̸= j2).
2
Thus the proof Lemma 7.41 is reduced to proving that each sheaf HH has a
trivial H1 on the proposed open intervals. The sheaves KB(j) are direct sums of
sheaves CI, with I an open interval of length π
k . If I, J be both open intervals
of length π
k and let H be another open interval (I, J, H are determined by qi, qj
and qi −qj), then it suﬃces to show that the sheaf T := HomC(CI, CJ)H has
a trivial H1 on the proposed intervals (d −π
2k −ϵ, d + π
2k + ϵ).
First we will determine the sheaf HomC(CI, CJ). Let us recall the deﬁnition
of the sheaf HomC(F, G) for two sheaves of complex vector spaces F and G on,
say, the circle S1. The sheaf HomC(F, G) is deﬁned as the sheaf associated to
the presheaf P given requiring P(U) to consist of the C-linear homomorphisms
h between the restrictions F|U and G|U. The element h consist of a family of
C-linear maps hV : F(V ) →G(V ), for all open V ⊂U, satisfying for all pairs of
open sets W ⊂V ⊂U the relation resG,V,W ◦hV = hW ◦resF,V,W . Here res∗,∗,∗
denote the restrictions of the sheaves F and G with respect to the sets W ⊂V .
A straightforward use of this deﬁnition leads to a C-linear homomorphism of
the sheaves φ : C →HomC(CI, C). Let I denote the closure of I. A small
calculation shows that the stalk of the second sheaf at a point outside I is 0
and the stalk at any point in I is isomorphic to C. Moreover, for any d, φd is
surjective. One concludes that HomC(CI, C) is isomorphic to CI. We recall
the exact sequence
0 →CJ →C →CS1\J →0.

222
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
We then have that HomC(CI, CJ) is the subsheaf of HomC(CI, C), consisting
of the h such that the composition CI
h→C →CS1\J is the zero map. Thus
HomC(CI, CJ) can be identiﬁed with (CI)J∩I. The sheaf T can therefore be
identiﬁed with (CI)J∩H∩I.
Let qi, qj and qi−qj have leading terms a, b and c with respect to the variable
z−1 and let the degree of qi −qj in z−1 be l. The intervals I, J, H are connected
components of the set of directions f such that Re(ae−ifk), Re(be−ifk) and
Re(ce−ifl) are positive. We must consider two cases.
Suppose ﬁrst that I ̸= J. Then one sees that J ∩H ∩I = H ∩I and moreover
the complement of this set in I has only one component. In this case the sheaf
T has trivial H1 for any open subset of S1.
Now suppose that I = J. The complement of J ∩H ∩I in I can have two
components, namely the two endpoints of the closed interval I. In this case the
H1 of the sheaf T on I is not trivial. However, the midpoint of I is a singular
direction. Thus only one of the two endpoints can belong to the open interval
(d −π
2k −ϵ, d + π
2k + ϵ) and the H1 of T on this interval is trivial.
2
We now deduce the following corollary.
Note that we are continuing to
assume that there is only one positive slope.
Corollary 7.43 The sheaves KA and KB are isomorphic on S1.
Proof.
Let (a, b) be a (maximal) interval, not containing a negative Stokes pair
for any of the qi. The proof of Lemma 7.41 shows in fact that the restrictions of
KA and KB to (a, b) are isomorphic. The sheaf KB has a direct sum decomposi-
tion ⊕s
i=1KB,i with KB,i := Cai
Ii , where the ai ≥1 are integers and the intervals
Ii are distinct and have length π
k . We may suppose that Ii = (di −π
2k, di + π
2k)
and that d1 < d2 < · · · < ds < d1(+2π) holds on the circle S1. The intervals
J1 := (ds −π
2k, d1 + π
2k), J2 := (d1 −π
2k, d2 + π
2k), . . . are maximal with respect to
the condition that they do not contain a negative Stokes pair. Choose isomor-
phisms σi : KB|Ji →KA|Ji for i = 1, 2. Then σ1,2 := σ−1
2 σ1 is an isomorphism
of KB|I1. We note that H0(I1, KB) = H0(I1, KB,1) = Ca1 and σ1,2 induces
an automorphism of Ca1 and of KB,1. The latter can be extended to an au-
tomorphism of KB on S1. After changing σ2 with this automorphism one may
assume that σ1,2 acts as the identity on Ca1. This implies that the restrictions
of σ1 and σ2 to the sheaf KB,1 coincide on J1 ∩J2. Thus we ﬁnd a morphism
of sheaves KB,1|J1∪J2 →KA|J1∪J2. Since the support of KB,1 lies in J1 ∪J2
we have a morphism τ1 : KB,1 →KA. In a similar way one constructs mor-
phisms τi : KB,i →KA. The sum ⊕τi is a morphism τ : KB →KA. This is an
isomorphism since it is an isomorphism for every stalk.

THE k-SUMMATION THEOREM
223
k-summability for a scalar diﬀerential equation
In this subsection we will reformulate Theorem 7.39 for a scalar diﬀerential
equation, i.e., an equation L ˆf = g with a diﬀerential operator L ∈C({z})[ d
dz],
g ∈C({z}) and ˆf ∈C((z)).
Instead of
d
dz, we will use the operator ∆= 1
kz d
dzzk. An operator L of order
n can be written as n
i=0 ai∆i with an = 1 and all ai ∈C({z}). In the sequel
we will suppose that the only slope present in L is k > 0 and that k is an integer.
In other words, all the eigenvalues qi of L (or of the associated matrix equation
δ −A) are in z−1C[z−1] and have degree k in z−1. A small calculation shows
that those conditions are equivalent to L having the form
L =
n

i=0
ai∆i with an = 1, ai ∈C{z} and a0(0) ̸= 0.
Deﬁne the initial polynomial of L with respect to ∆to be P(T ) = n
i=0 ai(0)T i.
One easily calculates that the eigenvalues of L are of the form cz−k + · · · where
c is a zero of the initial polynomial.
Then Theorem 7.39 has the following
corollary.
Corollary 7.44 The k-Summation Theorem for Scalar Diﬀerential Equations.
Consider the equation L ˆf = g with L as above, g ∈C({z}) and ˆf ∈C((z)).
Then ˆf is k-summable. More precisely:
1. A direction d is singular if and only if d is the argument of some ζ satis-
fying P(ζk) = 0. The negative Stokes pairs are the pairs {d −π
2k, d + π
2k}
with d a singular direction.
2. ˆf is k-summable in the direction d if d is not singular.
3. Suppose that the open interval (a, b) does not contain a negative Stokes pair
and that |b −a| > π
k , then there is a unique f ∈A 1
k (a, b) with J(f) = ˆf.
Moreover Lf = g.
Example 7.45 The method of Borel and Laplace applied to L ˆf = g.
For the special case L = P(∆) (i.e., all ai ∈C), we will give here an independent
proof of corollary 7.44, using the formal Borel transformation and the Laplace
transformation.
This works rather well because one obtains an explicit and
easy formula for ˆBk ˆf. The general case can be seen as a “perturbation” of this
special case. However the proof for the general case, using the method of Borel
and Laplace, is rather involved. The main problem is to show that ˆBk ˆf satisﬁes
part 2. of Theorem 7.34 .
The formal Borel transform ˆBk is only deﬁned for formal power series.
After subtracting from ˆf a suitable ﬁrst part of its Laurent series, we may
suppose that ˆf ∈C[[z]] and g ∈C{z}.
Put φ =
ˆBk( ˆf).
A small cal-
culation yields ˆBk(∆ˆf)(ζ) = ζkφ(ζ). The equation L ˆf = g is equivalent to

224
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
P(ζk)φ(ζ) = ( ˆBkg)(ζ) and has the unique solution φ(ζ) =
ˆ
Bkg
P (ζk). The function
g = 
n≥0 gnzn is convergent at 0, and thus |gn| ≤CRn for suitable positive
C, R. The absolute value of ˆBkg(ζ) = 
gn
Γ(1+ n

Ri|ζ|iexp(Rk|ζ|k).
Thus ˆBkg is an entire function on C and has an exponential growth of order
≤k, i.e., is bounded by ≤A exp(B|ζ|k) for suitable positive A, B.
The power series φ is clearly convergent and so ˆf ∈C[[z]] 1
k . Consider a di-
rection d with d ̸∈S := {arg(ζ1), ..., arg(ζdk)}, where {ζ1, ..., ζdk} are the roots of
P(ζk) = 0. Let a, b be consecutive elements of S with d ∈(a, b). The function φ
has, in the direction d, an analytic continuation with exponential growth of order
≤k. It follows that the integral f(z) := (Lk,dφ)(z) = 
d φ(ζ)exp(−( ζ
z)k) d( ζ
z)k
converges for arg(z) ∈(d −π
2k, d + π
2k) and small enough |z|. One can vary d in
the interval (a, b), without changing the function f. Thus f is deﬁned on the
open sector I := (a−π
2k, b+ π
2k). It is not diﬃcult to show that f ∈A1/k(I) with
J(f) = ˆf. Indeed, let φ(ζ) = 
i≥0 ciζi and write φ = N−1
i=0 ciζi + RN(ζ)ζN.
Put ˆf = 
i≥0 fizi. Then Lk,d(N−1
i=0 ciζi) = N−1
i=0 fizi and one has to verify
the required estimate for |Lk,d(RN(ζ)ζN)(z)|. Interchanging ∆and

d easily
leads to Lf = g. This proves the k-summability of ˆf and the properties 1., 2.
and 3.
More detailed information can be obtained by using the factorization P(T ) =
s
i=1(T −ci)ni, with ci the distinct roots of P(T ). Then L has a similar factoriza-
tion and one ﬁnds that the eigenvalues of L are qi = kciz−k−k, with multiplicity
ni, for i = 1, . . . , s. Write P(T )−1 = 
i
Ai(T )
(T −ci)ni . Then φ(ζ) =
ˆ
Bk
P (ζk) decom-
poses as  φi, where φi(ζ) =
Ai(ζk)
(ζk−ci)ni ( ˆBkg)(ζ). Consider a singular direction
d, which is the argument of a ζi with ζk
i = ci. Let d+, d−denote directions
with d−< d < d+ and d+ −d−small. Then Lk,d+φ and Lk,d−φ exist and the
diﬀerence Lk,d+φ −Lk,d−φ is equal to
−(2πi) Resζ=ζi(Ai(ζk) ˆBkg(ζ)
(ζk −ci)
dζk) z−kexp(−ciz−k).
As in Example 7.36, this formula gives an explicit 1-cocycle for the image of ˆf
in H1(S1, ker(L, A0)).

The Multisummation Theorem
Deﬁnition 7.46 k will denote a sequence of positive numbers k1 < k2 < · · · <
kr with k1 > 1/2. Let ˆv ∈C((z)) and let d be a direction. Then ˆv is called

7.8. THE MULTISUMMATION THEOREM
225
k-summable, or multisummable w.r.t. k in the direction d if there is a sequence
of elements v0, v1, . . . , vr and a positive ϵ such that:
1. v0 ∈H0(S1, A/A0
1/k1) and has image ˆv under the isomorphism of Propo-
sition 7.28.7.
2. vi ∈H0((d −
π
2ki −ϵ, d +
π
2ki + ϵ), A/A0
1/ki+1) for i = 1, . . . , r −1 and
vr ∈H0((d −
π
2kr −ϵ, d +
π
2kr + ϵ), A).
3. For i = 0, . . . , r −1, the images of vi and vi+1 in
H0((d −
π
2ki+1 −ϵ, d +
π
2ki+1 + ϵ), A/A0
1/ki+1) coincide. The k-sum of ˆv in
the direction d is the sequence (v1, . . . , vr).
One calls ˆv multisummable or k-summable if ˆv is k-summable in all but ﬁnitely
many directions.
This deﬁnition is extended in an obvious way to elements of C((z))n.
2
Remarks concerning the Deﬁnition 7.47
The notion of multisummability is due to ´Ecalle. His innovating manuscript
“L’accel´eration des fonctions r´esurgentes”, remains unpublished. References to
this unpublished material can be found in [197, 194] and [93]. Independently
and for a diﬀerent purpose, this notion was also introduced by Tougeron.
1. Condition 1. is of course the same thing as stating that ˆv ∈C((z))1/k1.
2. For any positive k, one sees the sheaf A/A0
1/k as a sheaf of “k-precise quasi-
functions”. Indeed, a section f of this sheaf above an open interval (a, b) can be
represented by a covering of (a, b) by intervals (ai, bi) and elements fi ∈A(ai, bi)
such that fi −fj is in general not zero but lies in A0
1/k((ai, bi) ∩(aj, bj)).
3. The idea of the deﬁnition is that ˆv, seen as an element of H0(S1, A/A0
1/k1),
is lifted successively to the elements v1, v2, . . . , living each time on a smaller
interval and being more precise. Finally the last one vr is really a function on
the corresponding interval.
4. The size of the intervals with bisector d is chosen in a critical way. Indeed,
for 1/2 < k < l, one can consider the natural map
R : H0((a, b), A/A0
1/l) →H0((a, b), A/A0
1/k).
The kernel of R is H0((a, b), A0
1/k/A0
1/l). According to the Theorem 7.48, the
kernel is 0 if |b −a| > π
k . For |b −a| ≤π
k the map is surjective according to
Lemma 7.49. In particular, the elements v1, . . . , vr are uniquely determined by
ˆv and the direction d.
2
In general one can show, using Theorem 7.48 below, that the multisum is
unique, if it exists.
We have unfortunately not found a direct proof in the
literature. The proofs given in [197] use integral transformations of the Laplace

and Borel type. However, a slight modiﬁcation of the deﬁnition of the multisum
for a formal solution of a linear diﬀerential equation yields uniqueness without
any reference to Theorem 7.48 (see Theorem 7.51 and Remark 7.58)
Theorem 7.48 A relative form of Watson’s Lemma.
Let 0 < k < l and |b −a| > π
k . Then H0((a, b), A0
1/k/A0
1/l) = 0.
Lemma 7.49 Suppose 1/2 < k < l and |b −a| ≤π
k . Then the canonical map
R : H0((a, b), A/A0
1/l) →H0((a, b), A/A0
1/k)
is surjective.
Proof.
The map H0((a, b), A) →H0((a, b), A/A0
1/k) is surjective, since by
Proposition 7.28 the group H1((a, b), A0
1/k) is zero. This map factors as
H0((a, b), A) →H0((a, b), A/A0
1/l)
R→H0((a, b), A/A0
1/k).
Thus R is surjective.
2
Exercise 7.50 Let k = k1 < · · · < kr with 1/2 < k1. Suppose that ˆv is the
sum of elements F1 + · · · + Fr, where each Fi ∈C((z)) is ki-summable. Prove
that ˆv is k-summable. Hint: Prove the following statements
(a) If r = 1, then k1-summable is the same thing as k-summable.
(b) If F and G are k-summable then so is F + G.
(c) Let k′ be obtained from k by leaving out ki. If F is k′-summable then F is
also k-summable.
2
Theorem 7.51 The Multisummation Theorem.
Let w be a vector with coordinates in C({z}) and let ˆv be a formal solution of
the equation (δ−A)ˆv = w. Let k = k1 < k2 < · · · < kr with 1/2 < k1 denote the
positive slopes of the diﬀerential operator δ −A. Then ˆv is k-summable in any
direction d which is not singular direction for any of the eigenvalues of δ −A.
In particular ˆv is k-summable.
Proof.
The formal equivalence ˆF −1(δ −A) ˆF = (δ −B), where (δ −B) is an
equation that is equivalent to a quasi-split diﬀerential equation for ˆF (Propo-
sition 3.41).
One proves as in Lemma 7.40 that ker(δ −A, (A0)n) is equal
to ker(δ −A, (A0
1/k1)n). If follows that ˆv has coordinates in C((z))1/k1. De-
ﬁne for i = 1, . . . , r the sheaves Vi = ker(δ −A, (A0
1/ki)n) and the sheaves Wi =
ker(δ−B, (A0
1/ki)n). For notational convenience we deﬁne Vr+1 and Wr+1 to be
zero. Take a direction d, which is not a singular direction for any of the eigenval-
ues of δ−A. The method of the proof of Lemma 7.41 yields that the restrictions
of the sheaves V1/V2 and W1/W2 to (d−π
2k1 −ϵ, d+ π
2k1 +ϵ) are isomorphic. More
generally the proof of Lemma 7.41 can be modiﬁed to show that the restrictions

7.8. THE MULTISUMMATION THEOREM
227
of the sheaves Vi/Vi+1 and Wi/Wi+1 to (d−π
2ki −ϵ, d+ π
2ki +ϵ), are isomorphic.
From Lemma 7.20 and Corollary 7.21 one concludes that the sheaves Wi/Wi+1
have a trivial H1 and also H0 on the interval (d −
π
2ki −ϵ, d +
π
2ki + ϵ) (note
that the sheaf ker(δ −B, (A0)n) decomposes as a direct sum of similar sheaves
where only one level (or one qi) is present). The same holds then for the sheaves
Vi/Vi+1.
Now v0 ∈H0(S1, (A/A0
1/k1)n) is simply the statement that ˆv ∈C((z))n
1/k1.
The element v1 ∈H0((d −
π
2k1 −ϵ, d +
π
2k1 + ϵ), (A/A0
1/k2)n) is supposed to
satisfy: (δ −A)v1 ≡w modulo A0
1/k2 and v0 and v1 have the same image in
H0((d −
π
2k1 −ϵ, d +
π
2k1 + ϵ), (A/A0
1/k1)n). The obstruction for the existence of
v1 is an element of the group H1((d −
π
2k1 −ϵ, d +
π
2k1 + ϵ), V1/V2). Since this
group is 0, the element v1 exists. Suppose that ˜v1 has the same properties. Then
˜v1 −v1 is a section of the sheaf V1/V2 on the interval (d −
π
2k1 −ϵ, d +
π
2k1 + ϵ).
Since we also have that the H0 of V1/V2 on this interval is 0, we ﬁnd ˜v1 = v1.
The existence and uniqueness of vi with (δ−A)vi ≡w modulo A0
1/ki+1 and vi and
vi−1 have the same image in H0((d −
π
2ki −ϵ, d +
π
2ki + ϵ), (A/A0
1/ki)n), follows
from H1 and H0 of Vi/Vi+1 being for the open interval under consideration.
Thus ˆv is k-summable in the direction d.
2
Corollary 7.52 We use the notation of theorem 7.51 and its proof.
For every i the sheaves Vi/Vi+1 and Wi/Wi+1 are isomorphic on S1. In partic-
ular, the spaces H1(S1, ker(δ −A, (A0)n)) and H1(S1, ker(δ −B, (A0)n)) have
the same dimension. Let (δ −B) be the direct sum of (δ −qi −Ci) where Ci
is a ni × ni-matrix and the degree of qi in z−1 is ki. Then the dimension of
H1(S1, ker(δ −A, (A0)n)) is equal to 
i kini.
Proof.
The ﬁrst statement has the same proof as Corollary 7.43. The dimen-
sion of the cohomology group H1 of the sheaf ker(δ −A, (A0)n) is easily seen
to be the sum of the dimensions of the H1 for the sheaves Vi/Vi+1. A similar
statement holds for δ −B and thus the equality of the dimensions follows. From
the direct sum decomposition of δ −B one easily derives the formula for the
dimension. Indeed, if the ki are integers then Lemma 7.20 implies the formula.
In general case, the ki are rational numbers. One takes an integer m ≥1 such
that all mki are integers and considers the map πm : S1 →S1, given by z →zm.
The H1 on S1 of F := ker(δ −B, (A0)n) is equal to H1(S1, π∗
mF)G, where G
is the cyclic group with generator z →e2πi/mz acting on S1. From this the
general case follows.
2
We now deﬁne an number that measures the diﬀerence between formal
and convergent solutions of δ −A.
Although we deﬁne this in terms of co-
homology we will show in Corollary 7.55 that this number is just dim ker(δ −
A, C((z))n/C({z})n).
This number and its properties are also described in
[186].

228
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
Deﬁnition 7.53 The dimension of H1(S1, ker(δ −A, (A0)n)) is called the ir-
regularity of δ −A.
2
We note that the irregularity of δ −A depends only on the formal normal
form δ −B of δ −A. Furthermore, Corollary 7.52 implies the following
Corollary 7.54 The irregularity of δ −A is zero if and only if δ −A is regular
singular.
Corollary 7.55 Let the matrix A have coordinates in C({z}).
Then δ −A
has a ﬁnite dimensional kernel and cokernel for its action on both C((z))n and
(C({z}))n. Deﬁne the Euler characteristics (or indices)
χ(δ −A, C((z))) = dim ker(δ −A, C((z))n) −dim coker(δ −A, C((z))n)
χ(δ −A, C({z})) = dim ker(δ −A, C({z})n) −dim coker(δ −A, C({z})n)
Then the irregularity of δ −A is equal to χ(δ −A, C((z))) −χ(δ −A, C({z})) =
dim ker(δ −A, C((z))n/C({z})n).
Proof.
Using Proposition 7.24.2, one sees that the exact sequence of sheaves
0 →A0 →A →C((z)) →0
induces an exact sequence
0 →C({z}) →C((z)) →H1(S1, A0) →0
and we can identify the group H1(S1, A0) with Q := C((z))/C({z}).
According to Theorem 7.12 the map (δ −A) : (A0)n →(A0)n is surjective and
one ﬁnds an exact sequence of sheaves
0 →ker(δ −A, (A0)n) →(A0)n →(A0)n →0
Taking cohomology on S1 one ﬁnds the exact sequence
0 →H1(S1, ker(δ −A, (A0)n)) →Qn δ−A
→Qn →0.
(7.2)
Let δ −A act on the exact sequence
0 →(C({z})n →(C((z)))n →Qn →0.
Let δ −A map each term in the exact sequence to itself. The sequence (7.2)
implies that coker(δ −A, Qn) = 0. The Snake Lemma ([169], Lemma 9.1, Ch.
III §10) applied to the last equivalence yields
0 →ker(δ −A, (C({z})n) →ker(δ −A, (C((z)))n) →ker(δ −A, Qn) (7.3)
→coker(δ −A, C({z})n) →coker(δ −A, C((z)))n) →0

7.8. THE MULTISUMMATION THEOREM
229
The two kernels in this exact sequence have a ﬁnite dimension. We shall show
below that the cokernel of δ −A on C((z))n has ﬁnite dimension. Thus the
other cokernel has also ﬁnite dimension and the formula for the irregularity of
δ −A follows.
To see that the cokernel of δ −A on C((z))n has ﬁnite dimension, note
that δ −A is formally equivalent to a quasi-split δ −B. We claim that it is
enough to prove this claim for equations of the form δ −q + C where q =
qNz−N + . . . + q1z−1, qN ̸= 0 and C is a matrix of constants. Since δ −B is
quasi-split, if we establish the claim, then δ −A will have ﬁnite dimensional
cokernel of C((z1/m)) for some m ≥1.
If v ∈C((z))N is in the image of
C((z1/m)) under δ −Z then it must be in the image of C((z)) under this map.
Therefore the claim would prove that δ −A would have ﬁnite cokernel.
To prove the claim ﬁrst assume that N > 0. Then for any v ∈Cn and any
m, (δ −q + C)zmv = qNzm−Nv + higher order terms, so δ −A has 0 cokernel.
If N = 0 (i.e. q = 0) then (δ −q + C)zmv = (mI + C)zmv. Since for suﬃciently
large m, mI + C is invertible, we have that δ −A has 0 cokernel on xmC[[z]]n
and therefore ﬁnite cokernel of C((x))n.
2
Remark 7.56 Corollaries 7.53 and 7.55 imply that if δ −A is regular singular
and w ∈C({z})n) then any solution v ∈C((z)))n) of (δ−A)v = w is convergent.
Exercise 7.57 Consider a diﬀerential operator L = n
i=0 aiδi ∈C({z})[δ]
with an = 1. Let δ −A be the associated matrix diﬀerential operator. Prove
that L as an operator on C((z)) and C({z}) has the same Euler characteristic
as the operator δ −A on C((z))n and C({z})n. Prove that the irregularity of
L, deﬁned as the irregularity of δ −A, is equal to −min0≤j≤n v(aj). Here v is
the additive valuation on C({z}) (or on C((z)) ) deﬁned by v(0) = +∞and
v(b) = m if b = 
n≥m bnzn with bm ̸= 0. Hint: Note that −min0≤j≤n v(aj)
is the diﬀerence in the y-coordinates of the ﬁrst and last corner of the Newton
polygon of L. Now use Corollary 7.52 and Remark 3.55.1.
The result of this exercise appears in [186] where a diﬀerent proof is presented.
The result is also present in [109]. A more general version (and other references)
appears in [179].
2
Remark 7.58 The uniqueness of the multisum v1, . . . , vr.
The uniqueness of the multisum for any formal ˆv, is an immediate consequence
of Theorem 7.48. In our situation ˆv is a formal solution of (δ −A)ˆv = w and d
is a non singular direction. Theorem 7.48 implies moreover that (δ −A)vi ≡w
modulo A0
1/ki+1.
We modify now the deﬁnition of the multisum of a formal solution ˆv of
(δ −A)ˆv = w by requiring that the sequence v1, . . . , vr satisﬁes (δ −A)vi ≡w
modulo A0
1/ki+1 for all i. The proof of Theorem 7.51 yields a unique sequence
v1, . . . , vr satisfying this modiﬁed deﬁnition.
In particular, for this modiﬁed
deﬁnition we avoid the use of Theorem 7.48.

230
CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
Proposition 7.59 Consider a formal solution ˆv of the equation (δ −A)ˆv = w.
Let k = k1 < · · · < kr with 1/2 < k1 denote the slopes of δ −A and let the
direction d be not singular for δ −A. Then there are F1, . . . , Fr ∈C((z)) such
that ˆv = F1 + · · · + Fr, each Fi is ki-summable in the direction d and (δ −A)Fi
convergent for each i.
Proof.
For convenience we consider only the case r = 2. It will be clear how
to extend the proof to the case r > 2.
Let Vi for i = 1, 2 denote, as in the proof of Theorem 7.51, the sheaf
ker(δ−A, (A0
1/ki)n). Let I denote the interval (d−π
2k1 −ϵ, d+ π
2k1 +ϵ) for suitable
positive ϵ. Since d is not a singular direction, one has that H1(I, V1/V2) = 0.
The obstruction for having an asymptotic lift of ˆv on the sector I is an element
ξ1 ∈H1(I, V1). From H0(I, V1/V2) = 0 and H1(I, V1/V2) = 0 one concludes
that the map H1(I, V2) →H1(I, V1) is an isomorphism. Let ξ2 ∈H1(I, V2)
map to ξ1. The element ξ2 can be given by a 1-cocycle with respect to a ﬁnite
covering of I, since H1(J, V2) = 0 if the length of the interval J is ≤π
k2 . Clearly,
the covering and the 1-cocycle can be completed to a 1-cocycle for V2 on S1. In
this way one ﬁnds a ξ3 ∈H1(S1, V2) which maps to ξ2.
One considers V2 as a subsheaf of (A0
1/k2)n. According to Proposition 7.28,
there is an element F2 ∈C((z))n
1/k2 which maps to ξ3. Furthermore (δ −A)F2
maps to (δ −A)ξ3 = 0. Thus w2 := (δ −A)F2 is convergent. The obstruction
for having an asymptotic lift of F2 to any interval J is an element of H1(J, V2)
(in fact the image of ξ3). Since d is not a singular direction, this obstruction
is 0 for an interval (d −
π
2k2 −ϵ, d +
π
2k2 + ϵ) for small enough positive ϵ. This
means that F2 is k2-summable in the direction d.
Deﬁne F1 := ˆv −F2 and w1 := w −w2. Then (δ −A)F1 = w1. One can
lift F1, locally, to a solution in (A1/k1)n of the equation. The obstruction for a
“global” asymptotic lift on the sector I is an element of H1(I, V1), namely the
diﬀerence of ξ1 and the image of ξ3. By construction, this diﬀerence is 0 and it
follows that F1 is k1-summable in the direction d.
2
The next lemma is rather useful. We will give a proof using Laplace and
Borel transforms (c.f., [15], page 30).
Lemma 7.60 Let 1/2 < k1 < k2 and suppose that the formal power series ˆf is
k1-summable and lies in C[[z]]1/k2. Then ˆf ∈C{z}.
Proof.
It suﬃces to show that ˆf is k1-summable for every direction d, since the
unique k1-sums in the various directions glue to an element of H0(S1, A1/k1),
which is equal to C({z}).
In what follows we suppose for convenience that
k1 = 1 and we consider the direction 0 and an interval (a, b) with a < 0 < b
and such that ˆf is 1-summable in every direction d ∈(a, b), d ̸= 0. We now
consider the formal Borel transform g := ˆB1 ˆf. If we can show that this deﬁnes

7.8. THE MULTISUMMATION THEOREM
231
an analytic function in a full sector containing d = 0 and having exponential
growth of order ≤1, then Theorem 7.34 implies that ˆf is 1-summable in the
direction d = 0.
One sees that g := ˆB1 ˆf is an entire function of exponential growth ≤k with
1
k = 1 −
1
k2 . Indeed, let ˆf = 
n≥0 cnzn. There are positive constants A1, A2
such that |cn| ≤A1An
2 (n!)1/k2 holds for all n ≥0. The coeﬃcients cn
n! of g satisfy
the inequalities | cn
n! | ≤A1An
2(n!)−1+ 1
k2 and this implies the exponential growth
at ∞of g of order ≤k. Moreover, according to Theorem 7.34, the function g
has exponential growth of order ≤1 for any direction d ∈(a, b), d ̸= 0. The
Phragm´en-Lindel¨of Theorem ([40], Ch. 33) implies that g has also exponential
growth at ∞of order ≤1 in the direction 0. In fact one can prove this claim
directly and in order to be complete, we include the proof.
Consider the closed sector S at ∞, given by the inequalities R ≤|ζ| < ∞
and | arg(ζ)| ≤α with a ﬁxed small α > 0. On the boundaries arg(ζ) = ±α
the inequality |g(ζ)| ≤A exp( B|ζ|) is given. Consider now the function h(ζ) =
g(ζ)exp( Mζ −ϵζk+δ), with δ and ϵ positive and small and we take M < 0
and such that M ≤−
B
cos α. The presence of the term exp(−ϵζk+δ) guarantees
that h(ζ) tends to zero for ζ ∈S, |ζ| →∞. Thus h is bounded on S and its
maximum is obtained on the boundary of S. For ζ ∈S with arg(ζ) = ±α one
estimates |h(ζ)| by
≤A exp(B|ζ|)exp(M cos(α)|ζ| −ϵ cos((k + δ)α)|ζ|)| ≤A.
For ζ ∈S with |ζ| = R one can estimate |h(ζ)| by max{|g(ζ)| | |ζ| = R and ζ ∈
S}. Thus there is a constant C > 0, not depending on our choices for M, ϵ, δ,
with |h(ζ)| ≤C for all ζ ∈S. The inequality |g(ζ)| ≤C|exp(−Mζ)| |exp(ϵζk+δ)|
holds for ﬁxed ζ ∈S and all ϵ > 0. Thus |g(ζ)| ≤C|exp(−Mζ)| holds on S and
g has exponential growth in the direction 0 of order ≤1.

According to Corollary 7.55, the cokernel of δ−A acting upon C({z})2 has
dimension k1 + k2. Using Corollary 7.22, one concludes that the cokernel

CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
• As in the proof of Theorem 7.51, we consider the sheaves V1
:=
ker(δ −A, (A0)2) = ker(δ −A, (A0
1/k1)2) and the subsheaf V2 := ker(δ −
A, (A0
1/k2)2) of V1. The sheaf V2 is isomorphic to ker(δ −q2, A0
1/k2), by
the map f →

0
f

. The sheaf V1/V2 is isomorphic to ker(δ −q1, A0
1/k1).
We want to show two results:
In general, the exact sequence 0 →V2 →V1 →V1/V2 →0 does not split.
In general, the decomposition of Proposition 7.59 depends on the chosen direc-
tion d.
Indeed, we will consider the above family of examples with q1 = z−1 and
q2 = z−2 and show that the exact sequence does not split and prove that the
formal solution ˆv of (δ −A)ˆv =

1
0

cannot globally, i.e., on all of S1, be written
as a sum F1 + F2 with ki-summable Fi for i = 1, 2.
It is further easily seen that the computations in this special case extend to
the general case of the above family of examples.
From now on we suppose q1 = z−1 and q2 = z−2.
Let e(q) denote the
standard solution of (δ −q)e(q) = 0, i.e. q ∈z−1C[z−1] and e(q) = exp(

q dz
z )
with again

q dz
z ∈z−1C[z−1]. The interval where e(q1) is ﬂat is I1 := (−π
2 , π
2 )
and the two intervals where q2 is ﬂat are I2 := (−π
4 , π
4 ) and I3 := ( 3π
4 , 5π
4 ). The
sheaf V1/V2 is isomorphic to CI1 and the sheaf V2 is isomorphic to CI2 ⊕CI3.
The exact sequence
0 →V2 →V1 →V1/V2 →0
of course splits locally. Two local splittings in a direction d diﬀer by a morphism
of (V1/V2)d →(V2)d. The obstruction to global splitting is therefore an element
of H1(S1, HomC(V1/V2, V2)). The sheaf appearing in this cohomology group
is, according to the proof of Lemma 7.41, isomorphic to (CI1)I2. Since I2 is
contained in I1, the above cohomology group is isomorphic to C. This is the
reason why we do not expect the sequence to be split. Of course we have to
make a computation in order to show that the obstruction is actually non trivial.
It suﬃces to show that H0(I1, V1) = 0. Indeed, suppose that the exact sequence
of sheaves splits above I1. Then
0 →H0(I1, V2) →H0(I1, V1) →H0(I1, V1/V2) →0
would be exact and thus H0(I1, V1) ∼= C.
A non zero element of H0(I1, V1) is a non zero multiple of

e(q1)
f

where
f would be ﬂat on I1 and satisﬁes (δ −q2)f = e(q1).
This equation has a
unique ﬂat solution F1 on the sector (−π
4 , π
2 ) and a unique ﬂat solution F2 on
the sector (−π
2 , π
4 ). According to the proof of Lemma 7.13, those two solutions
are given by integrals Fi(z) = e(q2)(z) 
λi e(−q2 + q1)(t) dt
t . The ﬁrst path λ1

7.8. THE MULTISUMMATION THEOREM
233
from 0 to z consists of two pieces {reiφ1| 0 ≤r ≤|z|} (for any φ1 such that
π
4 ≤φ1 < π
2 ) and {|z|eiφ| φ from φ1 to arg(z)}. The second path λ2 consists of
the two pieces {reiφ2| 0 ≤r ≤|z|} (for any φ2 such that −π
2 < φ2 ≤−π
4 ) and
{|z|eiφ| φ from φ2 to arg(z)}. We want to prove that F1 ̸= F2, because that
implies that the equation (δ −q2)f = e(q1) does not have a ﬂat solution on I1
and so H0(I1, V1) = 0.
The diﬀerence e(−q2)(F2 −F1) is a constant, i.e., independent of z, and
therefore equal to the integral 
λR e(−q2 + q1)(t) dt
t for R > 0, where λR is a
path consisting of three pieces {re−i π
4 | 0 ≤r ≤R}, {Reiφ| −π

{rei π

Numerical integration gives a = −0.2869... and thus the total integral is not 0.
We consider now the equation (δ −A)ˆv =

1
0

and suppose that ˆv = ˆv1 +
ˆv2 with a ki-summable ˆvi for i = 1, 2. Then (δ −A)ˆv1 is k1-summable and
belongs moreover to C((z))1/k2. According to Lemma 7.60, w1 := (δ −A)ˆv1 is
convergent. Then also w2 := (δ −A)ˆv2 is convergent. Since ˆv2 is k2-summable
it follows that w2 is modulo the image of (δ −A) on C({z})2 an element of the
form

0
h

with h a polynomial of degree ≤1. After changing ˆv2 by a convergent
vector, we may suppose that (δ −A)ˆv2 =

0
h

. Thus (δ −A)ˆv1 =

 1
−h

. Thus
we have found a k1-summable ˆF with (δ −A) ˆF =

1
k

with k a polynomial of
degree ≤1.
By deﬁnition, ˆF is k1-summable in all but ﬁnitely many directions. There is
some ϵ > 0 such that ˆF is k1-summable in all directions in (−ϵ, 0)∪(0, ϵ). Using
the ﬁrst interval one ﬁnds an f1 ∈(A1/k1)2(−ϵ −π
2 , π
2 ) with asymptotic expan-
sion ˆF. Then (δ −A)f1 is k1-summable with convergent asymptotic expansion

k

on the same interval. Thus, by Lemma 7.27, one has (δ −A)f1 =

1
k

. Sim-
ilarly there is an f2 ∈(A1/k1)2(−π
2 , π
2 + ϵ) with asymptotic expansion ˆF and
(δ−A)f2 =

1
k

. The diﬀerence f1−f2 lies in H0(I1, V1) and is therefore 0. Thus
there is an element f3 ∈(A1/k1)2(−ϵ −π
2 , π
2 + ϵ) with asymptotic expansion ˆF
and with (δ−A)f3 =

1
k

. The ﬁrst coordinate g of f3 lies in A1/k1(−ϵ−π
2 , π
2 +ϵ)
and satisﬁes the equation (δ −q1)g = 1. The formal solution ˆu of (δ −q1)ˆu = 1
has also a unique asymptotic lift ˜g on the sector S1 \{0}. The diﬀerence g −˜g is
zero on the two sectors (0, π
2 +ϵ) and (−ϵ−π
2 , 0), since the sheaf ker(δ −q1, A0)
has only the zero section on the two sectors. Thus g and ˜g glue to a convergent

CHAPTER 7. EXACT ASYMPTOTICS
solution of (δ −q1)h = 1 and h = ˆu is convergent. However, by Corollary 7.22,
one knows that ˆu is divergent. This ends the proof of our two claims.
We make some further comments on this example.
From H0(I1, V1) = 0 it
follows that also H1(I1, V1) = 0. This has the rather curious consequence that
any formal solution of (δ −A)ˆv = w has a unique asymptotic lift above the
sector I1. This asymptotic lift is in general not a k-sum in a direction.
We note that a small change of q1 and q2 does not eﬀect the above calculation
in the example. Similarly, one sees that q1 and q2 of other degrees k1 < k2 (in
the variable z−1) will produce in general the same phenomenon as above. Only
rather special relations between the coeﬃcients of q1 and q2 will produce a sheaf
V1 which is isomorphic to the direct sum of V2 and V1/V2.
The ﬁrst result gives a negative answer to the question posed by B. Malgrange
in [192] (2.1) p. 138. The second result gives a negative answer to another open
question.

Remarks 7.62 Multisummation and the Borel and Laplace transforms.
The translation of k-summability in terms of Borel and Laplace transforms,
given in Theorem 7.34, has an analogue for multisummation. We will not use
this formulation of multisummability, but present the highly complicated result
for the information of the reader. More information can be found in [15], [16].
Given are ˆf ∈C[[z]], a direction d and k = k1 < · · · < kr with k1 > 1/2. Then
ˆf is k-summable in the direction d if the formula
Lkra(κr)Bkr · · · Lkja(κj)Bkj · · · a(κ2)Bk2Lk1a(κ1)Bk1 ˆf is meaningful.
We will explain what is meant by this.
• The κi are deﬁned by

ki =

ki+1 + 1
κi . For notational convenience we write
kr+1 = ∞and hence κr = kr. Moreover A0
1/kr+1 is by deﬁnition 0.
• The ﬁrst Bk1 is by deﬁnition the formal Borel transform ˆBk1 of order
k1. The ﬁrst condition is that ˆBk1 ˆf is convergent, in other words ˆf ∈
C[[z]]1/k1.
• The Bkj are “extended” Borel transforms of order kj in the direction d for
j = 2, . . . , r. They can be seen as maps from A/A0

REGULAR SINGULAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
271
singular diﬀerential module has a basis such that the corresponding matrix
diﬀerential equation has the form
d
dzy = B
z y with B a constant matrix. The
symbols UnivRregsing and UnivGregsing denote the universal Picard-Vessiot ring
and the universal diﬀerential Galois group of C.
Proposition 10.1
1. C is equivalent to the neutral Tannakian category ReprZ and UnivGregsing
is isomorphic to the algebraic hull of Z.
2. The universal Picard-Vessiot ring UnivRregsing is equal to K[{za}a∈C, ℓ].
3. UnivGregsing = Spec(B) and the Hopf algebra B is given by:
(a) B equals C[{s(a)}a∈C, t] where the only relations between the gener-
ators {s(a)}a∈C, t are s(a + b) = s(a) · s(b) for all a, b ∈C.
(b) The comultiplication ∆on B is given by the formulas: ∆(s(a)) =
s(a) ⊗s(a) and ∆(t) = (t ⊗1) + (1 ⊗t).
Proof.
We note that the K-algebra UnivRregsing := K[{za}a∈C, ℓ] is deﬁned
by the relations: za+b = za · zb for all a, b ∈C and for any a ∈Z the symbol
za is equal to za as element of K. The diﬀerentiation in UnivRregsing is given
by
d
dzza = aza−1 and
d
dzℓ= z−1. From the fact that every regular singular
diﬀerential module can be represented by a matrix diﬀerential equation y′ = B
z y,
with B a constant matrix, one easily deduces that UnivRregsing is indeed the
universal Picard-Vessiot ring of C. This proves 2. The formal monodromy γ
is deﬁned as the K-linear automorphism of UnivRregsing given by the formulas
γ(za) = e2πiaza and γℓ= ℓ+ 2πi. Clearly γ ∈UnivGregsing.
The solution space VM of a regular singular diﬀerential module M is the space
VM = ker(∂M, UnivRregsing ⊗

K M).
The action of γ on Rregsing induces a
C-linear action γM on VM. One associates to M above the pair (VM, γM). The
latter is an object of ReprZ. It is easily veriﬁed that one obtains in this way
an equivalence C →ReprZ of Tannakian categories. According to part B of the
appendix, UnivGregsing is isomorphic to the algebraic hull of Z.
For the last part of the proposition one considers a commutative C-algebra
A and one has to investigate the group F(A) of the A ⊗C K-automorphisms
σ of A ⊗C UnivRregsing which commute with the diﬀerentiation on A ⊗C
UnivRregsing. For any a ∈C one has σza = h(a)·za with h(a) ∈A∗. Further h
is seen to be a group homomorphism h : C/Z →A∗. There is a c ∈A such that
σℓ= ℓ+ c. On the other hand, any choice of a homomorphism h and a c ∈A
deﬁne a unique σ ∈F(A). Therefore one can identify F(A) with HomC(B, A),
the set of the C-algebra homomorphisms from B to A. This set has a group
structure induced by ∆. It is obvious that the group structures on F(A) and
HomC(B, A) coincide.

CHAPTER 10. UNIVERSAL RINGS AND GROUPS
10.3
Formal Diﬀerential Equations
Again K = C((z)). For convenience one considers the diﬀerentiation δ := z d
dz
on K. Diﬀerential equations (or diﬀerential modules) over K are called formal
diﬀerential equations.
Theorem 10.2 Consider the neutral Tannakian category Diﬀ

K.
1. The universal Picard-Vessiot ring is
UnivRformal := K[{za}a∈C, ℓ, {e(q)}q∈Q], (see Section 3.2).
2. The diﬀerential Galois group UnivGformal of Diﬀ

K has the following
structure:
There is a split exact sequence of aﬃne group schemes
1 →Hom(Q, C∗) →UnivGformal →UnivGregsing →1.
The aﬃne group scheme Hom(Q, C∗) is called the exponential torus. The
formal monodromy γ ∈UnivRregsing acts on Q in an obvious way. This
induces an action of γ on the exponential torus. The latter coincides with
the action by conjugation of γ on the exponential torus. The action, by
conjugation, of UnivGregsing on the exponential torus is deduced from the
fact that UnivGregsing is the algebraic hull of the group ⟨γ⟩∼= Z.
Proof.
The ﬁrst part has been proved in Section 3.2.
The morphism
UnivGformal →UnivGregsing is derived from the inclusion UnivRregsing ⊂
UnivRformal. One associates to the automorphism σ ∈UnivGformal its restric-
tion to UnivRregsing. Any automorphism τ ∈UnivGregsing of UnivRregsing is
extended to the automorphism σ of UnivRformal by putting σe(q) = e(q) for all
q ∈Q. This provides the morphism UnivGregsing →UnivGformal. An element
σ in the kernel of UnivGformal →UnivGregsing acts on UnivRformal by ﬁxing
each za and ℓand by σe(q) = h(q) · e(q) where h : Q →C∗is a homomor-
phism. This yields the identiﬁcation of this kernel with the aﬃne group scheme
Hom(Q, C∗). Finally, the algebraic closure of K is contained in UnivRregsing
and in particular γ acts on the algebraic closure of K by sending each zλ (with
λ ∈Q) to e2πiλzλ. There is an induced action on Q, considered as a subset of
the algebraic closure of K. A straightforward calculation proves the rest of the
theorem.

10.4
Meromorphic Diﬀerential Equations
The diﬀerential ﬁeld is K = C({z}), the ﬁeld of the convergent Laurent series
over C.
On both ﬁelds K and K = C((z)) we will use the diﬀerentiation
δ = z d
dz. In this section we will treat the most interesting example and describe

MEROMORPHIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
273
the universal Picard-Vessiot ring UnivRconv and the universal diﬀerential Galois
group UnivGconv for the category DiﬀK of all diﬀerential modules over K.
Diﬀerential modules over K, or their associated matrix diﬀerential equations
over K, are called meromorphic diﬀerential equations. In this section we present
a complete proof of the description of UnivGconv given in the inspiring paper
[202].
Our ﬁrst claim that there is a more or less explicit expression for the universal
Picard-Vessiot ring UnivRconv of DiﬀK. For this purpose we deﬁne a K-algebra
D with K ⊂D ⊂K as follows: f ∈K belongs to D if and only if f satisﬁes some
linear scalar diﬀerential equation f (n)+an−1f (n−1) +· · ·+a1f (1) +a0f = 0 with
all coeﬃcients ai ∈K. This condition on f can be restated as follows: f belongs
to D if and only the K-linear subspace of K generated by all the derivatives
of f is ﬁnite dimensional. It follows easily that D is an algebra over K stable
under diﬀerentiation. The following example shows that D is not a ﬁeld.
Example 10.3 The diﬀerential equation y(2) = z−3y (here we have used the
ordinary diﬀerentiation
d
dz) has a solution f = 
n≥2 anzn ∈K given by a2 = 1
and an+1 = n(n −1)an for n ≥2. Clearly f is a divergent power series and
by deﬁnition f ∈D. Suppose that also f −1 ∈D. Then also u := f ′
f lies in D
and there is a ﬁnite dimensional K-vector space W with K ⊂W ⊂ˆK which
is invariant under diﬀerentiation and contains u. We note that u′ + u2 = z−3
and consequently u2 ∈W. Suppose that un ∈W. Then (un)′ = nun−1u′ =
nun−1(−u2 +z−3) ∈W and thus un+1 ∈W. Since all the powers of u belong to
W the element u must be algebraic over K. It is known that K is algebraically
closed in K and thus u ∈K. The element u can be written as 2
z +b0 +b1z +· · ·
and since f ′ = uf one ﬁnds f = z2 · exp(b0z + b1 z2
2 + · · · ). The latter is a
convergent power series and we have obtained a contradiction. We note that D
can be seen as the linear diﬀerential closure of K into K. It seems diﬃcult to
make the K-algebra D really explicit. (See Exercise 1.39 for a general approach
to functions f such f and 1/f both satisfy linear diﬀerential equations).
2
Lemma 10.4 The universal Picard-Vessiot ring for the category of all mero-
morphic diﬀerential equations is UnivRconv := D[{za}a∈C, ℓ, {e(q)}q∈Q].
Proof.
The algebra UnivRformal contains UnivRconv and UnivRconv is gen-
erated, as a K-algebra, by the entries of F and det(F)−1 of all fundamental
matrices F of meromorphic equations. The entries of a fundamental matrix are
expressions in za, ℓ, e(q) and formal Laurent series. The formal Laurent series
that occur satisfy some linear scalar diﬀerential equation over K. From this the
lemma follows.
2
The universal diﬀerential Galois group for DiﬀK is denoted by UnivGconv.
The inclusion UnivRconv ⊂UnivRformal induces an injective morphism of aﬃne
group schemes UnivGformal →UnivGconv. One can also deﬁne a morphism

274
CHAPTER 10. UNIVERSAL RINGS AND GROUPS
UnivGconv →UnivGformal of aﬃne group schemes. In order to do this correctly
we replace UnivGconv and UnivGformal by their functors Gconv and Gformal from
the category of the commutative C-algebras to the category of groups. Let A be
a commutative C-algebra. One deﬁnes Gconv(A) →Gformal(A) by sending any
automorphism σ ∈Gconv(A) to τ ∈Gformal(A) deﬁned by the formula τ(g) =
σ(g) for g = za, ℓ, e(q). The group homomorphism Gformal(A) →Gconv(A) is
deﬁned by sending τ to its restriction σ on the subring A ⊗C UnivRconv of
A ⊗C UnivRformal. The functor N is deﬁned by letting N(A) be the kernel of
the surjective group homomorphism Gconv(A) →Gformal(A). In other words,
N(A) consists of the automorphisms σ ∈Gconv(A) satisfying σ(g) = g for
g = za, ℓ, e(q). It can be seen that N is representable and thus deﬁnes an aﬃne
group scheme N. Thus we have shown:
Lemma 10.5 There is a split exact sequence of aﬃne group schemes
1 →N →UnivGconv →UnivGformal →1.
The above lemma reduces the description of the structure of UnivGconv to
a description of N and the action of UnivGformal on N. In the sequel we will
study the structure of the Lie algebra Lie(N) of N. We are working with aﬃne
group schemes G, which are not linear algebraic groups, and consequently have
to be somewhat careful about their Lie algebras Lie(G).
Deﬁnition 10.6 A pro-Lie algebra L over C is the projective limit lim
←Lj of
ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebras.
2
Clearly L has the structure of Lie algebra. We have to introduce a topology on
L in order to ﬁnd the “correct” ﬁnite dimensional representations of L. This
can be done as follows.
An ideal I ⊂L will be called closed if I contains
∩j∈F ker (L →Lj) for some ﬁnite set of indices F.
Deﬁnition 10.7 A representation of a pro-Lie algebra L on a ﬁnite dimensional
vector space W over C will be a homomorphism of complex Lie algebras L →
End(W) such that its kernel is a closed ideal.
2
For an aﬃne group scheme G, which is the projective limit lim
←Gj of linear
algebraic groups Gj, one deﬁnes Lie(G) as the pro-Lie algebra lim
←
Lie(Gj).
Suppose that G is connected, then we claim that any ﬁnite dimensional complex
representation of G yields a ﬁnite dimensional representation of Lie(G). Indeed,
this statement is known for linear algebraic groups over C. Thus Lie(Gj) and
Gj have the same ﬁnite dimensional complex representations. Since every ﬁnite
dimensional complex representation of G or of the pro-Lie algebra Lie(G) factors
over some Gj or some Lie(Gj), the claim follows.
Now we return to the pro-Lie algebra Lie(N). The identiﬁcation of the aﬃne
group scheme N with a group of automorphisms of UnivRconv leads to the

MEROMORPHIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
275
identiﬁcation of Lie(N) with the complex Lie algebra of the K-linear derivations
D : UnivRconv →UnivRconv, commuting with the diﬀerentiation on UnivRconv
and satisfying D(g) = 0 for g = za, ℓ, e(q). A derivation D ∈Lie(N) is therefore
determined by its restriction to D ⊂UnivRconv. One can show that an ideal I
in Lie(N) is closed if and only if there are ﬁnitely many elements f1, . . . fs ∈D
such that I ⊃{D ∈Lie(N)| D(f1) = · · · = D(fs) = 0}.
We search now for elements in N and Lie(N). For any direction d ∈R and
any meromorphic diﬀerential module M one has deﬁned in Section 8.3 an el-
ement Std acting on the solution space VM of M. In fact Std is a K-linear
automorphism of the Picard-Vessiot ring RM of M, commuting with the dif-
ferentiation on RM. The functoriality of the multisummation implies that Std
depends functorially on M and induces an automorphism of the direct limit
UnivRconv of all Picard-Vessiot rings RM. By construction Std leaves za, ℓ, e(q)
invariant and therefore Std lies in N. The action of Std on any solution space
VM is unipotent. The Picard-Vessiot ring RM is as a K-algebra generated by
the coordinates of the solution space VM = ker(∂, RM ⊗M) in RM. It follows
that every ﬁnite subset of RM lies in a ﬁnite dimensional K-vector space, in-
variant under Std and such that the action of Std is unipotent. The same holds
for the action of Std on UnivRconv. We refer to this property by saying: Std
acts locally unipotent on Rconv.
The above property of Std implies that ∆d := log Std is a well deﬁned K-
linear map UnivRconv →UnivRconv. Clearly ∆d is a derivation on UnivRconv,
belongs to Lie(N) and is locally nilpotent. The algebra UnivRconv has a di-
rect sum decomposition UnivRconv = ⊕q∈QUnivRconv, q where UnivRconv, q :=
D[{za}a∈C, ℓ]e(q). This allows us to decompose ∆d : D →UnivRconv as direct
sum 
q∈Q ∆d,q by the formula ∆d(f) = 
q∈Q ∆d,q(f) and where ∆d,q(f) ∈
UnivRconv, q for each q ∈Q.
We note that ∆d,q = 0 if d is not a singular
direction for q. The map ∆d,q : D →UnivRconv has a unique extension to an
element in Lie(N).
Deﬁnition 10.8 The elements {∆d,q| d singular direction for q} are called alien
derivations.
2
We note that the above construction and the term alien derivation are due to
J. ´Ecalle [92]. This concept is the main ingredient for his theory of resurgence.
The group UnivGformal ⊂UnivGconv acts on Lie(N) by conjugation. For
a homomorphism h : Q →C∗one writes τh for the element of this group
is deﬁned by the properties that τh leaves za, and ℓinvariant and τe(q) =
h(q) · e(q). Let γ denote, as before, the formal monodromy. According to the
structure of UnivGformal described in Chapter 3, it suﬃces to know the action
by conjugation of the τh and γ on Lie(N). For the elements ∆d,q one has the
explicit formulas:
(a) γ∆d,qγ−1 = ∆d−2π,γ(q).

276
CHAPTER 10. UNIVERSAL RINGS AND GROUPS
(b) τh∆d,qτ −1
h
= h(q) · ∆d,q.
Consider the set S := {∆d,q| d ∈R, q ∈Q, d singular for q}. We would like
to state that S generates the Lie algebra Lie(N) and that these elements are
independent. This is close to being correct. The fact that the ∆d,q act locally
nilpotent on UnivRconv however complicates the ﬁnal statement. In order to
be more precise we have to go through some general constructions with Lie
algebras.
A Construction with Free Lie Algebras
We recall some classical constructions, see [143], Ch. V.4. Let S be any set. Let
W denote a vector space over C with basis S. By W ⊗m we denote the m-fold
tensor product W ⊗C · · · ⊗C W (note that this is not the symmetric tensor
product). Then F{S} := C ⊕⊕
m≥1 W ⊗m is the free associative algebra on the
set S. It comes equipped with a map i : S →F{S}. The universal property of
(i, F{S}) reads:
For any associative C-algebra B and any map φ : S →B there is a
unique C-algebra homomorphism φ′ : F{S} →B with φ′ ◦i = φ.
The algebra F{S} is also a Lie algebra with respect to the Lie brackets [ , ]
deﬁned by [A, B] = AB −BA. The free Lie algebra on the set S is denoted by
Lie{S} and is deﬁned as the Lie subalgebra of F{S} generated by W ⊂F{S}.
This Lie algebra is equipped with an obvious map i : S →Lie{S} and the pair
(i, Lie{S}) has the following universal property:
For any complex Lie algebra L and any map φ : S →L there is
a unique homomorphism φ′ : Lie{S} →L of complex Lie algebras
such that φ′ ◦i = φ.
Further for any associative complex algebra B and any homomorphism ψ :
Lie{S} →B of complex Lie algebras (where B is given its canonical structure
as complex Lie algebra) there a unique homomorphism ψ′ : F{S} →B of
complex algebras such that the restriction of ψ′ to Lie{S} coincides with ψ.
Consider now a ﬁnite dimensional complex vector space W and an action of
Lie{S} on W. This amounts to a homomorphism of complex Lie algebras ψ :
Lie{S} →End(W) or to a C-algebra homomorphism ψ′ : F{S} →End(W).
Here we are only interested in those ψ such that:
(1) ψ(s) = ψ′(s) is nilpotent for all s ∈S.
(2) there are only ﬁnitely many s ∈S with ψ(s) ̸= 0.
For any ψ satisfying (1) and (2) one considers the ideal kerψ in the Lie algebra
Lie{S} and its quotient Lie algebra Lie{S}/ker ψ. One deﬁnes now a sort of

MEROMORPHIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
277
completion 
Lie{S} of Lie{S} as the projective limit of the Lie{S}/ker ψ, taken
over all ψ satisfying (1) and (2).
Lemma 10.9 Let W be a ﬁnite dimensional complex vector space and let
N1, . . . , Ns denote nilpotent elements of End(W). Then the Lie algebra L gener-
ated by N1, . . . , Ns is algebraic, i.e., it is the Lie algebra of a connected algebraic
subgroup of GL(W).
Proof.
Let N ∈End(W) be a nilpotent map and suppose N ̸= 0. Then the
map t ∈Ga,C →exp(tN) ∈GL(W) is a morphism of algebraic groups. Its
image is an algebraic subgroup H of GL(W), isomorphic to Ga,C. The Lie
algebra of H is equal to CN.
Let G1, . . . , Gs be the algebraic subgroups of GL(W), each one isomorphic
to Ga,C, with Lie algebras CN1, . . . , CNs. The algebraic group G generated
by G1, . . . , Gs is equal to H1 · H2 · · · · · Hm for some m and some choice for
H1, . . . , Hm ∈{G1, . . . , Gs} ([141], Proposition 7.5). Then G is connected and
from this representation one concludes that the Lie algebra of G is the Lie
algebra generated by N1, . . . , Ns.
2
We apply the lemma to the Lie algebra Lψ := Lie{S}/ker ψ, considered above.
By deﬁnition this is a Lie algebra in End(W) generated by ﬁnitely many nilpo-
tent elements. Let Gψ denote the connected algebraic group with Lie(Gψ) = Lψ.
The connected linear algebraic groups Gψ form a projective system. We will
denote the corresponding projective limit by M. The pro-Lie algebra 
Lie{S} is
clearly the pro-Lie algebra of M.
In the sequel S will be the collection of all alien derivations S := {∆d,q| d ∈
R, q ∈Q, d is singular for q}. The action of UnivGformal on the set of the
alien derivations induces an action on 
Lie{S} and an action on the aﬃne group
scheme M. The aﬃne variety M × UnivGformal is made into an aﬃne group
scheme by the formula (m1, g1) · (m2, g2) = (m1 · g1m2g−1
1 , g1g2) for the com-
position. The precise interpretation of this formula is obtained by replacing M
and UnivGformal by their corresponding functors M and Gformal and deﬁne for
every commutative C-algebra A the group structure on M(A) × Gformal(A) by
the above formula, where g1m2g−1
1
stands for the known action of UnivGformal
on M.
The result is an aﬃne group scheme which is a semi-direct product
M ⋊UnivGformal. We can now formulate the description of J. Martinet and
J.-P. Ramis for the structure of UnivGconv and Lie(N), namely
Theorem 10.10 The aﬃne group scheme M ⋊UnivGformal is canonically iso-
morphic to UnivGconv. In particular N is isomorphic to M and therefore N is
connected. Let S denote again the set of all alien derivations {∆d,q| d ∈R, q ∈
Q, d is singular for q}. Then there exists an isomorphism of complex pro-Lie
algebra ψ : 
Lie{S} →Lie(N) which respects the UnivGformal-action on both
pro-Lie algebras.

278
CHAPTER 10. UNIVERSAL RINGS AND GROUPS
Proof.
By deﬁnition, the Tannakian categories DiﬀK and ReprUnivGconv are
equivalent. According to Section 9.2 the Tannakian categories DiﬀK and Gr2 are
also equivalent. Now we consider the Tannakian category ReprM⋊UnivGformal.
An object of this category is a ﬁnite dimensional complex vector space W pro-
vided with an action of M ⋊UnivGformal. The action of UnivGformal on W
gives W the structure of an object of Gr1, namely a direct sum decomposition
W = ⊕q∈QWq and the action of the formal monodromy γ on W has image
γW ∈GL(W) satisfying the required properties. The additional action of M on
W translates into an action of its pro-Lie algebra 
Lie{S} on W. According to
the deﬁnition of this pro-Lie algebra the latter translates into a set of nilpotent
elements {∆W,d,q} ⊂End(W), where ∆W,d,q denotes the action of ∆d,q on W.
By deﬁnition there are only ﬁnitely many non-zero ∆W,d,q and every ∆W,d,q is
nilpotent. Using the structure of the semi-direct product M ⋊UnivGformal and
in particular the action of UnivGformal on 
Lie{S} one ﬁnds the properties:
(a) γW ∆W,d,qγ−1
W = ∆W,d−2π,γ(q) and
(b) ∆W,d,q is a C-linear map which maps each summand Wq′ of W
to Wq+q′.
Deﬁne now ∆W,d := ⊕q∈Q∆W,d,q. This is easily seen to be a nilpotent map. De-
ﬁne StW,d
:=
exp(∆W,d).
Then it is obvious that the resulting tuple
(W, {Wq}, γW , {StW,d}) is an object of Gr2. The converse, i.e., every object
of Gr2 induces a representation of M ⋊UnivGformal, is also true. The con-
clusion is that the Tannakian categories ReprM⋊UnivGformal and Gr2 are equiv-
alent.
Then the Tannakian categories ReprM⋊UnivGformal and ReprUnivGconv
are equivalent and the aﬃne group schemes M ⋊UnivGformal and UnivGconv
are isomorphic. If one follows the equivalences between the above Tannakian
categories then one obtains an isomorphism φ of aﬃne group schemes M ⋊
UnivGformal →UnivGconv which induces the identity from UnivGformal to
UnivGconv/N ∼= UnivGformal. Therefore φ induces an isomorphism M →N
and the rest of the theorem is then obvious.

Remarks 10.11
(1) Let W be a ﬁnite dimensional complex representation of UnivGconv. Then
the image of N ⊂UnivGconv in GL(W) contains all Std operating on W. As
in the above proof, W can be seen as an object of the category Gr2. One can
build examples such that the smallest algebraic subgroup of GL(W) contain-
ing all Std is not a normal subgroup of the diﬀerential Galois group, i.e., the
image of UnivGconv →GL(W). The above theorem implies that the smallest
normal algebraic subgroup of GL(W) containing all the Std is the image of
N →GL(W).
(2) Theorem 10.10 can be seen as a diﬀerential analogue of a conjecture of
I.R. Shafarevich concerning the Galois group Gal(Q/Q). Let Q(µ∞) denote
the maximal cyclotomic extension of Q. Further S denotes an explicitly given
countable subset of the Galois group Gal(Q/Q(µ∞). The conjecture states that

MEROMORPHIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
279
the above Galois group is a proﬁnite completion F of the free non-abelian group
F on S. This proﬁnite completion F is deﬁned as the projective limit of the
F/H, where H runs in the set of the normal subgroups of ﬁnite index of G such
that H contains a co-ﬁnite subset of S.

Chapter 11
Inverse Problems
11.1
Introduction
In this chapter we continue the investigation of Chapter 10 concerning the dif-
ferential Galois theory for special classes of diﬀerential modules. Recall that
K is a diﬀerential ﬁeld such that its ﬁeld of constants C = {a ∈K| a′ = 0}
has characteristic 0, is algebraically closed and diﬀerent from K. Further C
is a full subcategory of the category DiﬀK of all diﬀerential modules over K,
which is closed under all operations of linear algebra, i.e., kernels, cokernels,
direct sums and tensor products. Then C is a neutral Tannakian category and
thus isomorphic to ReprG for some aﬃne group scheme G over C. The inverse
problem of diﬀerential Galois theory for the category C asks for a description of
the linear algebraic groups H which occur as a diﬀerential Galois group of some
object in C. We note that H occurs as a diﬀerential Galois group if and only
if there exists a surjective morphism G →H of aﬃne group schemes over C.
The very few examples where an explicit description of G is known are treated
in Chapter 10. In the present chapter we investigate the, a priori, easier inverse
problem for certain categories C. This is a reworked version of [229].
It is interesting to compare this with Abhyankar’s conjecture [1] and its solution.
The simplest form of this conjecture concerns the projective line P1
k = A1
k∪{∞}
over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic p > 0. A covering of P1
k,
unramiﬁed outside ∞, is a ﬁnite morphism f : X →P1
k of projective non-
singular curves such that f is unramiﬁed at every point x ∈X with f(x) ̸= ∞.
The covering f is called a Galois covering if the group H of the automorphisms
h : X →X with f ◦h = f has the property that X/H is isomorphic to P1
k.
If moreover X is irreducible then one calls f : X →P1
k a (connected) Galois
cover. Abhyankar’s conjecture states that a ﬁnite group H is the Galois group
of a Galois cover of P1
k unramiﬁed outside ∞if and only if H = p(H) where
p(H) is the subgroup of H generated by its elements of order a power of p. We
281

282
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
note in passing that p(H) is also the subgroup of H generated by all its p-Sylow
subgroups.
This conjecture has been proved by M. Raynaud [243] (and in greater generality
by Harbater [121]). The collection of all coverings of P1
k, unramiﬁed outside ∞,
is easily seen to be a Galois category (see Appendix B). In particular, there
exists a proﬁnite group G, such that this category is isomorphic to PermG. A
ﬁnite group H is the Galois group of a Galois cover of P1
k, unramiﬁed outside
∞, if and only if there exists a surjective continuous homomorphism of groups
G →H. No explicit description of the proﬁnite group G is known although the
collection of its ﬁnite continuous images is given by Raynaud’s theorem. We
will return to Abhyankar’s conjecture in Section 11.6 for a closer look at the
analogy with the inverse problem for diﬀerential equations.
Examples 11.1 Some easy cases for the inverse problem.
1. Let C denote the category of the regular singular diﬀerential modules over
the diﬀerential ﬁeld C((z)).
Corollary 3.32 states that the Galois group of
such a module is the Zariski closure of a subgroup generated by one element.
Conversely, given a constant n × n matrix D, let C be an n × n constant
matrix satisfying D = e2πiC. Theorem 5.1 implies that the local monodromy of
z∂zY = CY is given by D and that this coincides with the formal monodromy.
Therefore, we can conclude that a linear algebraic group G is a diﬀerential
Galois group for an object in C if and only if G is topologically generated by one
element (i.e., there exists a subgroup H of G generated by one element which
is dense in G for the Zariski topology). This also follows from the results of
Section 10.2.
2. Let X be a compact Riemann surface of genus g and S ⊂X a ﬁnite set
of cardinality s. The diﬀerential ﬁeld K is the ﬁeld of meromorphic functions
on X. Let q ∈X be a point and t a local parameter at q. Then the ﬁeld of
the locally deﬁned meromorphic functions Kq at q is isomorphic to C({t}). One
calls a diﬀerential module M over K regular or regular singular at q if M ⊗K Kq
is regular or regular singular (over Kq). Now one deﬁnes the full subcategory C
of DiﬀK whose objects are the diﬀerential modules M over K which are regular
for every q ̸∈S and regular singular (or regular) at the points q ∈S. The
answer to the inverse problem is:
Let π1(X \ S) denote the fundamental group of X \ S. A linear algebraic group
G is a diﬀerential Galois group for the category C if and only if there exists a
homomorphism π1(X \S) →G such that its image is dense in G for the Zariski
topology. In particular if s ≥1 then G is a diﬀerential group for C if and only
if G is topologically generated by at most 2g + s −1 elements (i.e., there is a
Zariski dense subgroup H of G generated by at most 2g + s −1 elements).
The proof goes as follows. The solution of the weak form of the Riemann-Hilbert
Problem (Theorem 6.15) extends to the present situation. Thus an object M of

THE INVERSE PROBLEM FOR C((z))
283
C corresponds to a representation ρ : π1(X \ S) →GL(V ), where V is a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space over C. The Zariski closure of the image of ρ coincides
with the diﬀerential Galois group of M. Indeed, Theorem 5.8 and its proof are
valid in this more general situation. Finally, the fundamental group of X \ S is
known to be the free group on 2g + s −1 elements, if s ≥1.
2
Although the universal diﬀerential Galois group has been determined for
DiﬀK and the diﬀerential ﬁelds K = C((z)) and K = C({z}), it is not at
all evident how to characterize the linear algebraic groups which are factors of
this universal diﬀerential Galois group. Theorems 11.2 and 11.13 give such a
characterization. In this chapter we shall assume a greater familiarity with the
theory of linear algebraic groups and Lie algebras. Besides the speciﬁc references
given below, general references are [45], [141] and [279].
11.2
The Inverse Problem for C((z))
Theorem 11.2 A linear algebraic group G over C is a diﬀerential Galois group
of a diﬀerential module over C((z)) if and only if G contains a normal subgroup
T such that T is a torus and G/T is topologically generated by one element.
Proof.
In Section 3.2 we introduced a category Gr1 of triples which is equiv-
alent to the Tannakian category DiﬀC((z)). If the diﬀerential module M corre-
sponds to the triple (V, {Vq}, γV ), then, according to Corollary 3.32, the diﬀeren-
tial Galois group G of M is the smallest algebraic subgroup of GL(V ) containing
the exponential torus T and the formal monodromy γV . The exponential torus
T is a normal subgroup of G and G/T is topologically generated by the image
of γV . This proves one direction of the theorem.
For the proof of the other direction, we ﬁx an embedding of G into GL(V )
for some ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space (in other words V is a faithful G-
module). The action of T on V is given by distinct characters χ1, . . . , χs of
T and a decomposition V = ⊕s
i=1Vχi such that for every t ∈T , every i and
every v ∈Vχi one has tv = χi(t) · v. Let A ∈G map to a topological generator
of G/T . Then A permutes the vector spaces Vχi. Indeed, for t ∈T and v ∈
Vχi one has tAv = A(A−1tA)v = χi(A−1tA)Av. Deﬁne the character χj by
χj(t) = χi(A−1tA). Then AVχi = Vχj. The proof will be ﬁnished if we can ﬁnd
a triple (V, {Vq}, γV ) in Gr1 such that V = Vq1 ⊕· · · ⊕Vqs with Vqi = Vχi for all
i = 1, . . . , s and A = γV . This will be shown in the next lemma.
2
We will write Aχi = χj. Recall that Q = ∪m≥1z−1/mC[z−1/m] carries an
action of γ given by γzλ = e2πiλzλ.
Lemma 11.3 There are elements q1, . . . , qs ∈Q such that
1. if Aχi = χj then γ(qi) = qj.

284
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
2. if n1χ1 + · · · + nsχs = 0 (here with additive notation for characters) for
some n1, . . . , ns ∈Z, then n1q1 + · · · + nsqs = 0.
Furthermore if N ≥1 is an integer, then there exists q1, . . . , qs satisfying 1. and
2. and such that for any i ̸= j the degrees of qi −qj in z−1 are ≥N.
Proof.
Conditions 1. and 2. can be translated into: the Z-module Zχ1 + · · · +
Zχs can be embedded into Q such that the action of A is compatible with the
action of γ on Q. Let Q ⊂C denote the algebraic closure of Q.
Consider M := Q ⊗(Zχ1 + · · · + Zχs) ⊃Zχ1 + · · · + Zχs with the induced
A action. Since a power of A acts as the identity on M we may decompose
M = ⊕ζjMζj, where ζj runs over a ﬁnite set of roots of unity and A acts on Mζj
as multiplication by ζj. Furthermore, Q = ⊕λ∈Q, λ<0Czλ and γ acts on Czλ as
multiplication by e2πiλ. Deﬁne λj ∈Q, λj < 0 by e2πiλj = ζj and λj is maximal.
Choose for every j an embedding of Q-vector spaces Mζj ⊂zλjz−NC[z−1].
Then the resulting embedding M ⊂Q has the required properties. Moreover,
any non-zero element of M is mapped to an element of degree ≥N in the
variable z−1.
2
Remark 11.4 In Proposition 20 of [163], Kovacic characterizes (in a diﬀerent
way) those connected solvable groups that appear as diﬀerential Galois groups
over C((z)). In this case, one can show that the two characterizations coincide.
We note that the diﬀerential Galois group for a Picard-Vessiot extension of
C((z)) is always solvable although not always connected.

11.3
Some Topics on Linear Algebraic Groups
For the formulations of the solution of some inverse problem by J.-P. Ramis,
C. Mitschi and M.F. Singer we will need constructions with linear algebraic
groups which are not standard. Let C be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of char-
acteristic zero.
Deﬁnition 11.5 The groups L(G) and V (G) = G/L(G).
Let G be a linear algebraic group over C. The subgroup L(G) of G is deﬁned
as the group generated by all (maximal) tori lying in G. The group V (G) is
deﬁned to be G/L(G).
2
It is clear that L(G) is a normal subgroup of G, contained in the connected
component of the identity Go of G. According to the Proposition and its Corol-
lary of Chapter 7.5 of [141] (or Proposition 7.5 and Theorem 7.6 of [45]) L(G)
is a (connected) algebraic subgroup of G. The factor group V (G) := G/L(G) is
again a linear algebraic group.

TOPICS ON LINEAR ALGEBRAIC GROUPS
285
Let G be a connected linear algebraic group over C.
The unipotent radical
of G is denoted by Ru. Let P ⊂G be a Levi factor, i.e., a closed subgroup
such that G is the semi-direct product of Ru and P (see [141], p 184). The
group Ru/(Ru, Ru), where (Ru, Ru) is the (closed) commutator subgroup, is a
commutative unipotent group and so isomorphic to Gn
a(C) = Cn. The group P
acts on Ru by conjugation and this induces an action on Ru/(Ru, Ru). Therefore
we may write Ru/(Ru, Ru) = U n1
1
⊕· · · ⊕U ns
s , where each Ui is an irreducible
P-module.
For notational convenience, we suppose that U1 is the trivial 1-
dimensional P-module and n1 ≥0. Since P is reductive, one can write P = T ·H,
where T is a torus and H is a semi-simple group. Deﬁne mi := ni if the action
of H on Ui is trivial and mi := ni + 1 if the action of H on Ui is not trivial.
Deﬁne N = 0 if H is trivial and N = 1 otherwise.
Deﬁnition 11.6 The defect and the excess of a linear algebraic group.
The defect d(G) is deﬁned to be n1 and the excess e(G) is deﬁned as
max(N, m2, . . . , ms).
2
Since two Levi factors are conjugate, these numbers do not depend on the choice
of P.
The results of Ramis are stated in terms of the group V (G) whereas
the results of Mitschi-Singer are stated in terms of the defect and excess of a
connected linear algebraic group. We wish to explain the connection between
V (G) and the defect. We start with the following lemma.
Lemma 11.7 If G is a connected linear algebraic group deﬁned over C, then
d(G) = dimC Ru/(G, Ru).
Proof.
We note that Ru/(G, Ru) is a commutative unipotent group and so
can be identiﬁed with a vector space over C. As in the deﬁnition of defect,
we let P be a Levi factor and write Ru/(Ru, Ru) = U n1
1
⊕. . . ⊕U ns
s
where
each Ui is an irreducible P-module and U1 is the trivial one dimensional P-
module. Since (Ru, Ru) ⊂(G, Ru) we have a canonical surjective homomor-
phism π : Ru/(Ru, Ru) →Ru/(G, Ru). We shall show that the kernel of this
homomorphism is U n2
2
⊕. . . ⊕U ns
s
and so d(G) = n1 = dim Ru/(G, Ru).
First note that the kernel of π is (G, Ru)/(Ru, Ru) and that this latter group
is (P, Ru)/(Ru, Ru). To see this second statement note that for g ∈G we may
write g = pu, p ∈P, u ∈Ru. For any w ∈Ru, gwg−1w−1 = puwu−1p−1w−1 =
p(uwu−1)p−1(uw−1u−1)(uwu−1w−1). This has the following consequence
(G, Ru)/(Ru, Ru) ⊂(P, Ru)/(Ru, Ru). The reverse inclusion is clear.
Next we will show that (P, Ru)/(Ru, Ru) = U n2
2 ⊕. . .⊕U ns

group additively and note that the group (P, Ru)/(Ru, Ru) is the subgroup

since Ui is an irreducible P-module, we have that the image generates all of Ui.

and completes the proof.

We now introduce the normal subgroup (Ru, Go) of G generated by the com-
mutators {aba−1b−1| a ∈Ru, b ∈Go} and the semi direct product S(G) =
Ru/(Ru, Go) ⋊G/Go of Ru/(Ru, Go) and G/Go, with respect to the action (by
conjugation) of G/Go on Ru/(Ru, Go) (see [209]).
Proposition 11.8 (Ramis [234])
Let (V (G)o, V (G)o) denote the normal subgroup of V (G) generated by the com-
mutators {aba−1b−1| a, b ∈V (G)o}. There is an isomorphism of linear algebraic
groups S(G) →V (G)/(V (G)o, V (G)o).
Proof.
(1) We start by proving that a reductive group M has the property
L(M) = M o.
We recall that in characteristic 0, a linear algebraic group is
reductive if and only if any ﬁnite dimensional representation is completely re-
ducible (see the Appendix of [32]). It follows at once that N := M/L(M) is also
reductive. Thus the unipotent radical of N is trivial. By construction N o has
a trivial maximal torus and is therefore unipotent and equal to the unipotent
radical of N. Thus N o = 1. Since L(M) is connected, the statement follows.
(2) Let G be a connected linear algebraic group and Ru its unipotent radical.
As noted above G is the semi-direct product Ru ⋊M, where M is a Levi-
factor.
We note that a maximal torus of M is also a maximal torus of G.
Let τ1 : G = Ru ⋊M →V (G) := G/L(G) denote the canonical map. Since
L(M) = M, the kernel of τ1 is the smallest normal subgroup of G containing
M. The kernel of the natural map τ2 : G = Ru ⋊M →V (G)/(V (G), V (G)) is
the smallest normal subgroup containing M and (G, G). This is the same as the
smallest normal subgroup containing M and (Ru, G), since G = Ru · M. Thus
the map τ2 induces an isomorphism Ru/(Ru, G) →V (G)/(V (G), V (G)).
(3) Let G be any linear algebraic group. We consider V (G) := G/L(G) and
S′(G) := V (G)/(V (G)o, V (G)o). The component of the identity S′(G)o is easily
identiﬁed with S′(Go) and according to (2) isomorphic to the unipotent group
Ru/(Ru, Go). Further S′(G)/S′(G)o is canonically isomorphic to G/Go. Using
that S′(G)o is unipotent, one can construct a left inverse for the surjective
homomorphism S′(G) →G/Go (see Lemma 11.10.1). Thus S′(G) is isomorphic
to the semi-direct product of Ru/(Go, Ru) and G/Go, given by the action of
G/Go on Ru/(Ru, Go), deﬁned by conjugation. Therefore S(G) and S′(G) are
isomorphic.
2
To ﬁnish the proof of Proposition 11.8 (and show the connection between
the defect of G and V (G) in Corollary 11.11), we need to prove Lemma 11.10
below. We ﬁrst prove an auxiliary lemma. Recall that a group G is divisible if
for any g ∈G and n ∈N −{0}, there is an h ∈G such that hn = g.

TOPICS ON LINEAR ALGEBRAIC GROUPS
287
Lemma 11.9 Let H be a linear algebraic group such that Ho is abelian, divisible
and has a ﬁnite number of elements of any given ﬁnite order. Then H contains
a ﬁnite subgroup ˜H such that H = ˜HHo.
Proof.
We follow the presentation of this fact given in [302], Lemma 10.10. Let
t1, . . . , ts be coset representatives of H/Ho. For any g ∈H we have that tig =
tiσai for some ai ∈Ho and permutation σ. Let ˜H = {g ∈H | a1a2 ·. . .·as = 1}.
One can check that ˜H is a group and that the map φ : g →σ that associates each
g ∈˜H to the σ described above maps ˜H homomorphically into the symmetric
group Ss. If g ∈˜H and φ(g) = id then ai = g for all i and so g ∈Ho and
of ﬁnite order s. Therefore the kernel of φ is a subset of the set of elements of
order at most s in Ho. Therefore the kernel of φ is ﬁnite and so ˜H is ﬁnite.
To ﬁnish the proof we will show that H = ˜HHo. The inclusion ˜HHo ⊂H is
clear so it is enough to show that for any g ∈H there is a go ∈Ho such that
gg−1
o
∈˜H. Let tig = tiσai and let go ∈Ho such that gs
o = a1 · . . . · as. Such
an element exists because Ho is divisible. We then have that tigg−1
o
= tiσaig−1
o
and a1g−1
o a2g−1
o
· . . . · asg−1
o
= a1 · . . . · asg−n
o
= 1 so gg−1

∈˜H.
2
Lemma 11.10 Let H be a linear algebraic group such that Ho is unipotent.
Then
1. H is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of Ho and H/Ho.
2. H and H/(Ho, Ho) have the same minimal number of topological (for the
Zariski topology) generators.
Proof.
1. Deﬁne the closed normal subgroups Ho
k of H by Ho
0 = Ho and
Ho
k+1 = (Ho, Ho
k) for k ≥0. Since Ho is a unipotent group Ho
k = {1} for large
k. Let l(H) denote the smallest integer m ≥0 such that Ho
k = {1} for all m > k.
We shall proceed by induction on l(H). The induction hypothesis implies that
H contains a subgroup H′ such that H′/Ho
k is ﬁnite and H = H′Ho. The group
Ho
k is abelian, connected and unipotent. Since the base ﬁeld is assumed to be
of characteristic zero, a unipotent matrix other than the identity cannot be of
ﬁnite order. Therefore, for any nonnegative integer s the map g →gs from Ho
k
to itself must be an isomorphism. This implies that Ho
k is divisible and has
no elements of ﬁnite order other than the identity. Lemma 11.9 implies that
H′ = ˜HHo
k for some ﬁnite group ˜H and so H = ˜HHo. Since Ho is unipotent,
we have that ˜H ∩Ho is trivial and the conclusion follows.
2. It suﬃces to show the following:
Let a1, . . . , an ∈H be such that their images in H/(Ho, Ho) are
topological generators, then a1, . . . , an are topological generators of
H itself.

288
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
We will prove the above statement by induction on l(H). The cases l(H) = 0, 1
are trivial. Suppose l(H) = n > 1 and let M denote the closed subgroup of
H generated by a1, . . . , an. The induction hypotheses implies that the natural
homomorphism M →H/Ho
n is surjective. It suﬃces to show that M ⊃Ho
n.
Take a ∈Ho, b ∈Ho
n−1 and consider the element aba−1b−1 ∈Ho
n. One can
write a = m1A, b = m2B with m1, m2 ∈M and A, B ∈Ho
n.
Since Ho

Corollary 11.11 The linear algebraic groups S(G), V (G) := G/L(G) and
V (G)/(V (G)o, V (G)o) have the same minimal number of topological generators
(for the Zariski topology). Moreover, for connected linear algebraic groups, the
defect d(G) of Deﬁnition 11.6, coincides with the minimal number of topological
generators of G/L(G).
Remark 11.12 Lemma 11.10.1 can be partially generalized to arbitrary linear
algebraic groups. The result (due to Platanov; see [302], Lemma 10.10) is: If C
is an algebraically closed ﬁeld and G is a linear algebraic group deﬁned over C,
then G = HGo for some ﬁnite subgroup H of G.
To prove this, let B be a Borel subgroup of Go (see Chapter VIII of [141]) and
N be the normalizer of B. We claim that G = NGo. Let g ∈G. Since all Borel
subgroups of Go are conjugate there exists an h ∈Go such that gBg−1 = hBh−1.
Therefore h−1g ∈N and so G ⊂NGo. The reverse inclusion is clear.
It is therefore enough to prove the theorem for N and so we may assume that G is
a group whose identity component is solvable. We therefore have a composition
series Go = Gm ⊃Gm−1 ⊃. . . ⊃G1 ⊃Go = {e} where each Gi/Gi−1 is
isomorphic to Ga(C) or Gm(C). By induction on m we may assume that there
is a subgroup K of G such that K/G1 is ﬁnite and G = KGo. This allows us
to assume that Go is itself isomorphic to Ga(C) or Gm(C). One now applies
Lemma 11.9.
Platonov’s Theorem, combined with Jordan’s Theorem, can also be used to
prove Proposition 4.18 (see [302], Theorem 3.6 and Corollary 10.11).

11.4
The Local Theorem
In this section we give a proof of Ramis’s solution of the inverse problem for
DiﬀK with K = C({z}) (c.f., [234, 240, 241].
Theorem 11.13 (J.-P. Ramis) The local theorem.
A linear algebraic group G is a diﬀerential Galois group over the ﬁeld C({z}) if
and only if G/L(G) is topologically (for the Zariski topology) generated by one
element.

THE LOCAL THEOREM
289
The proof of the “only if” part is more or less obvious. Suppose that G is
the diﬀerential Galois group of some diﬀerential module M over C({z}). The
diﬀerential Galois theory implies, see 1.34 part 2. and 2.34 (3), that G/L(G)
is also the diﬀerential Galois group of some diﬀerential module N over C({z}).
The diﬀerential Galois group of C((z)) ⊗N, and in particular its exponential
torus, is a subgroup of G/L(G). Since G/L(G) has a trivial maximal torus,
Corollary 3.32 implies that N is regular singular and so its Galois group of
C((z))⊗N is generated by the formal monodromy. This element corresponds to
the topological monodromy in the Galois group of N so G/L(G) is topologically
generated by the topological monodromy of N. The latter is the image of the
topological monodromy of M. This proves the “only if” part of Theorem 11.13
and yields the next corollary.
Corollary 11.14 Suppose that G is a diﬀerential Galois group over the ﬁeld
C({z}), then G/L(G) is topologically generated by the image of the topological
monodromy.
The proof of the “if” part of Theorem 11.13 is made more transparent by
the introduction of yet another Tannakian category Gr3.
Deﬁnition 11.15 The category Gr3.
The objects of the category Gr3 are tuples (V, {Vq}, γV , stV,d) with
1. (V, {Vq}, γV ) is an object of Gr1.
2. For every d ∈R there is given a stV,d ∈⊕qi,qjHom(Vqi, Vqj), where the
sum is taken over all pairs i, j with Vqi ̸= 0, Vqj ̸= 0 and d is a singular
direction for qi −qj.
3. For every d ∈R one requires that γ−1
V stV,dγV = stV,d+2π.
The morphisms of Gr3 are deﬁned as follows. We identify any linear map Ai,j :
Vqi →Vqj with the linear map V
projection
→
Vqi
Ai,j
→Vqj
inclusion
→
V .
In this
way, Hom(Vqi, Vqj) is identiﬁed with a subspace of End(V ). A morphism f :
(V, {Vq}, γV , stV,d) →(W, {Wq}, γW , stW,d) is a linear map V →W satisfying
f(Vq) ⊂Wq, f ◦γV = γW ◦f, f ◦stV,d = stW,d ◦f for all d.
2
The tensor product of two objects (V, {Vq}, γV , stV,d), (W, {Wq}, γW , stW,d)
is the vector space V ⊗W with the data (V ⊗W)q = ⊕q1,q2;q1+q2=qVq1 ⊗Wq2,
γV ⊗W = γV ⊗γW and stV ⊗W,d = stV,d ⊗idW + idV ⊗stW,d. It is easily seen
that Gr3 is again a neutral Tannakian category. In fact, we will show that the
Tannakian categories Gr2 and Gr3 are isomorphic.
Lemma 11.16
1. The exponential map exp : Gr3 →Gr2 induces an equivalence of Tan-
nakian categories.

290
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
2. Let the object (V, {Vq}, γV , stV,d) be associated to a diﬀerential equation
over C({z}). Then the diﬀerential Galois group G ⊂GL(V ) is the small-
est algebraic subgroup such that:
(a) The exponential torus and γV belong to G.
(b) All stV,d belong to the Lie algebra of G.
Proof.
The exponential map associates to (V, {Vq}, γV , stV,d) the object
(V, {Vq}, γV , StV,d) with StV,d = exp(stV,d) for all d.
It is easily seen that
this results in an equivalence of Tannakian categories. The second part of the
lemma is a reformulation of Theorem 8.10.
2
Let G be given such that G/L(G) is topologically generated by one element.
The following lemma will be a guide for the construction of an object in the
category Gr3 having G as diﬀerential Galois group. For this we need to consider
G as a subgroup of GL(V ) for some ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space V and
describe the action of G on V in some detail. We shall consider linear algebraic
groups with the following data:
Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C and G ⊂GL(V ) an algebraic
subgroup. Let T denote a maximal torus and g, t ⊂End(V ) be the Lie algebras
of G and T . The action of T on V yields a decomposition V = ⊕s
i=1Vχi, where
the χi are distinct characters of T and the non-trivial spaces Vχi are deﬁned as
{v ∈V | tv = χi(t)v for all t ∈T }.
For each i, j one identiﬁes Hom(Vχi, Vχj) with a linear subset of End(V ) by
identifying φ ∈Hom(Vχi, Vχj) with V
pri
→Vχi
φ→Vχj ⊂V , where pri denotes
the projection onto Vχi, along ⊕k̸=iVχk. The adjoint action of T on g yields a
decomposition g = g0 ⊕
α̸=0 gα. By deﬁnition, the adjoint action of T on g0
is the identity and is multiplication by the character α ̸= 0 on the spaces gα.
(We note that here the additive notation for characters is used. In particular,
α ̸= 0 means that α is not the trivial character).
Any B ∈g can be written as  Bi,j with Bi,j ∈Hom(Vχi, Vχj). The adjoint
action of t ∈T on B has the form Ad(t)B =  χ−1
i χj(t)Bi,j. It follows that
the α ̸= 0 with gα ̸= 0 have the form χ−1
i χj. In particular 
i,j;χ−1
i
χj=α Bi,j ∈
gα ⊂g. Let L(G) denote, as before, the subgroup of G generated by all the
conjugates of T .
Lemma 11.17 (J.-P. Ramis)
The Lie algebra of L(G) is generated by the subspaces t and {gα}α̸=0.
Proof.
Consider some α ̸= 0 and a non-zero element ξ ∈gα. From the deﬁni-
tion of gα and α ̸= 0 it follows that there is an ordering, denoted by V1, . . . , Vs
, of the spaces {Vχi}, such that ξ maps each Vi into some Vj with j > i. In
particular, ξ is nilpotent and Cξ is an algebraic Lie algebra corresponding to

THE LOCAL THEOREM
291
the algebraic subgroup {exp(cξ)|c ∈C} of G. Let h denote the Lie algebra gen-
erated by the algebraic Lie algebras t and Cξ for all ξ ∈gα with α ̸= 0. Then
h is an algebraic Lie algebra. (see [45] Proposition (7.5), p. 190, and Theorem
(7.6), p. 192).
Take an element t ∈T such that all χi(t) are distinct. Then clearly t · exp(ξ)
is semi-simple and lies therefore in a conjugate of the maximal torus T . Thus
exp(ξ) = t−1 · (t · exp(ξ)) ∈L(G) and ξ lies in the Lie algebra of L(G). This
proves that the Lie algebra h is a subset of the Lie algebra of L(G).
On the other hand, h is easily seen to be an ideal in g. The connected normal
algebraic subgroup H ⊂Go corresponding to h contains T and therefore L(G).
This proves the other inclusion.
2
Continuation of the proof of theorem 11.13.
We add to the above data for G the assumption that G/L(G) is topologically
generated by one element a. The aim is to produce an object (V, {Vq}, γV , stV,d)
of Gr3 such that the group deﬁned by the conditions (a) and (b) of the second
part of Lemma 11.16 is equal to G.
Choose a representative A ∈G of a ∈G/L(G). Since T is also a maximal torus
of L(G), there exists B ∈L(G) such that AT A−1 = BT B−1. After replacing
A by B−1A we may suppose that AT A−1 = T . The element A ∈G permutes
the spaces Vχi in the decomposition V = ⊕s
i=1Vχi with respect to the action
of T . As before we will write ˜Aχi = χj if χj(t) = χi(A−1tA) for all t ∈T .
Lemma 11.3 produces an object (V, {Vq}, γV ) of Gr1 such that Vχi = Vqi for
i = 1, . . . , s and γV = A.
As before, g denotes the Lie algebra of G (or Go). The decomposition of g with
respect to the adjoint action of the torus T has already been made explicit,
namely
gα = ⊕i,j;χ−1
i
χj=αg ∩Hom(Vqi, Vqj).
The above object (V, {Vq}, γV ) in Gr1 is made into an object of Gr3 by choosing
arbitrary elements stV,d ∈gα, where α = χ−1
i χj and 0 ≤d < 2π is a singular
direction for qi −qj. The number of singular directions d modulo 2π for qi −qj
is by construction suﬃciently large to ensure a choice of the set {stV,d} such
that these elements generate the vector space ⊕α̸=0gα.
Finally, we verify that the algebraic group
˜G, associated to the object
(V, {Vq}, γV , stV,d), is equal to G. By construction ˜G ⊂G and by deﬁnition
˜G is the smallest algebraic group with:
(a) The exponential torus and γV lie in ˜G.
(b) The Lie algebra of ˜G contains all stV,d.

292
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
By construction, the exponential torus is equal to T and lies in ˜G. The Lie
algebra t lies in the Lie algebra of ˜G. Again by construction, each gα (with
α ̸= 0) belongs to the Lie algebra of ˜G. Lemma 11.17 implies that L(G) is
contained in ˜G. The choice of γV = A implies that ˜G = G.

Examples 11.18 Diﬀerential Galois groups in GL(2) for C({z}).
For convenience we consider order two equations over C({z}) with diﬀerential
Galois group in SL(2). The well known classiﬁcation of the algebraic subgroups
G of SL(2) (c.f., Section 1.4) can be used to determine the G’s such that G/L(G)
is topologically generated by one element. The list (of conjugacy classes) that
one ﬁnds is:
SL2, B, Ga, {±1} × Ga, Gm, D∞, ﬁnite cyclic ,
where B is the Borel subgroup, Ga the additive group, Gm the multiplicative
group and D∞is the inﬁnite dihedral group, i.e., the subgroup of SL2 leaving
the union of two lines L1 ∪L2 ⊂C2 (through the origin) invariant.
Every group in the above list can be realized by a scalar diﬀerential equation
y′′ + mz−1y′ −a0y = 0 where m ∈{0, 1} and a0 ∈C[z, z−1].
In fact the choices (m, a0)= (0, z), (0, z2 + 3z + 5/4), (1, 0), (0, −z−2
4 ), (0, z−2),
(0, −3
16z−2 + z−1), (0, 1
4(−1 + ( t
n)2)z−2) with
t
n ∈Q produce the above list of
diﬀerential Galois groups.
2
Remark 11.19 In Proposition 21 of [163], Kovacic gives a characterization
of those connected solvable linear algebraic groups that appear as diﬀerential
Galois groups over C(z). Once again, this characterization can be shown to be
equivalent to the above in this case.

11.5
The Global Theorem
In this section X is a compact (connected) Riemann surface of genus g and
S = {p1, . . . , ps} is a ﬁnite subset of X. The diﬀerential ﬁeld K is the ﬁeld
of the meromorphic functions on X. Let Diﬀ(X,S) denote the full subcategory
of DiﬀK whose objects are the diﬀerential modules which are regular at every
point q ∈X \ S.
Proposition 11.20 Let π1(X \ S) denote the fundamental group of X \ S. Let
M be a diﬀerential module in the category Diﬀ(X,S) having diﬀerential Galois
group G. There is a natural homomorphism π1(X \ S) →G/L(G) which has
dense image with respect to the Zariski topology. In particular, G/L(G) is topo-
logically generated by at most 2g + s −1 elements if s > 0.

THE GLOBAL THEOREM
293
Proof.
The Tannakian approach implies that there exists a diﬀerential module
N in the category Diﬀ(X,S) with diﬀerential Galois group V (G) = G/L(G)
(see 2.34 (3)). Consider a point q ∈X with local parameter t, which is singular
for N. Let Kq denote the ﬁeld of meromorphic functions at q. Then Kq ∼=
C({t}). The diﬀerential Galois group of C((t))⊗N over C((t)) can be embedded
as a subgroup of V (G). Since the maximal torus of V (G) is trivial, we conclude
that every singular point of N is regular singular. Now Example 11.1.2 ﬁnishes
the proof.
2
It is interesting to note that Proposition 11.20 implies a result of O. Gabber,
namely that π1(X \ S) →G/Go is surjective (see [151], 1.2.5).
For non-empty S one deﬁnes the full subcategory C of DiﬀK to be the sub-
category whose objects are the diﬀerential modules M such that M is regular
for any q ̸∈S and M is regular singular at p1, . . . , ps−1.
Theorem 11.21 (J.-P. Ramis) The global theorem.
A linear algebraic group G is the diﬀerential Galois group of a diﬀerential module
M in C if and only if G/L(G) is topologically generated by 2g + s −1 elements.
Proof.
The “only if” part is proved in Proposition 11.20. Consider a linear
algebraic group G such that G/L(G) is topologically generated by at most 2g +
s −1 elements.
One chooses small disjoint disks X1, . . . , Xs around the points p1, . . . , ps. Let
X∗
i = Xi \{pi}. In X∗
s one chooses a point c. The fundamental group π1(X0, c),
where X0 = X \ {p1, . . . , ps}, is generated by a1, b1, .., ag, bg, λ1, .., λs and has
one relation a1b1a−1
1 b−1
1
· · · λ1 · · · λs = 1. The element λs is a loop in X∗
s around
ps and the other λi are loops around p1, . . . , ps−1. The diﬀerential module over
X is constructed by glueing certain connections M0, . . . , Ms (with possibly
singularities), living above the spaces X0, . . . , Xs.
Let pr : G →G/L(G) denote the canonical homomorphism. One chooses a
homomorphism ρ : π1(X0, c) →G ⊂GL(V ), such that the homomorphism
prρ has Zariski dense image.
Consider the algebraic group G′ = pr−1(<<
prρ(λs) >>), where << a >> denotes the algebraic subgroup generated by
the element a. The group G′ contains L(G) and so G′/L(G′) is topologically
generated by the image of ρ(λs). According to the Ramis’s local theorem, G′ is
the diﬀerential Galois group of a diﬀerential equation over the ﬁeld Kps. One
can extend this very local object to a diﬀerential module Ms, living above Xs,
with only ps as singular point. The solution space at the point c ∈Xs and
the action of G′ on this space can be identiﬁed with V and G′ ⊂GL(V ). The
topological monodromy corresponding to λs can be arranged to be ρ(λs) ∈G′.
The usual solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem (in weak form) provides
a diﬀerential module M0 above X0 such that the monodromy action is equal
to ρ. The restrictions of M0 to X∗
s and Ms to X∗
s are determined by their

294
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
local monodromies. These are both equal to ρ(λs) ∈G ⊂GL(V ). Thus we
have a canonical way to glue M0 and Ms over the open subset X∗
s . For each
point pi, i = 1, . . . , s −1 one can consider the restriction of M0 to X∗
i . This
restriction is determined by its local monodromy around the point pi. Clearly,
the restriction of M0 to X∗
i can be extended to a diﬀerential module Mi above
Xi with a regular singular point at pi.
The modules M0, M1, . . . , Ms (or rather the corresponding analytic vector bun-
dles) are in this way glued to a vector bundle M above X. The connections can
be written as ∇: M0 →ΩX ⊗M0, ∇: Mi →ΩX(pi) ⊗Mi for i = 1, . . . , s −1
and ∇: Ms →ΩX(dps) ⊗Ms for a suitable integer d ≥0. The connections
also glue to a connection ∇: M →ΩX(p1 + · · · + ps−1 + dps) ⊗M. Let M∗
denote the set of all meromorphic sections of M. Then M∗is a vector space
over K of dimension n with a connection ∇: M∗→ΩK/C ⊗M∗. Thus we
have found a diﬀerential module over K with the correct singularities. K has
a natural embedding in the ﬁeld Kc. The diﬀerential module is trivial over Kc
and its Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld PV over K can be seen as a subﬁeld of Kc. The
solution space is V ⊂PV ⊂Kc.
Finally we have to show that the diﬀerential Galois group H ⊂GL(V ) is actually
G. By construction G′ ⊂H and also the image of ρ lies in H. This implies that
G ⊂H. In order to conclude that G = H we can use the Galois correspondence.
Thus we have ﬁnally to prove that an element f ∈PV ⊂Kc, which is invariant
under G, belongs to K.
Since G′ is by construction the diﬀerential Galois group of Ms above Xs, we
conclude from the invariance of f under G′ that f extends to a meromorphic
solution of the diﬀerential equation above Xs. The invariance of f under the
image of ρ implies that f extends to a meromorphic solution of the diﬀeren-
tial equation above X0 ∪Xs. The points p1, . . . , ps−1 are regular singular and
any solution of the diﬀerential equation above X∗
i , i = 1, . . . , s −1 extends
meromorphically to Xi. Thus f is meromorphic on X and belongs to K.
2
Remark 11.22 For the case of X = P1 and ps = ∞, it is possible to reﬁne the
above reasoning to prove the following statement.
2
Corollary 11.23 Let G ⊂GLn(C) be an algebraic group such that G/L(G)
is topologically generated by s −1 elements. Then there are constant matrices
A1, . . . , As−1 and there is a matrix A∞with polynomial coeﬃcients (all matrices
of order n × n) such that the matrix diﬀerential equation
y′ = (
A1
z −p1
+ · · · +
As−1
z −ps−1
+ A∞)y
has diﬀerential Galois group G ⊂GLn(C).

Examples 11.24 Some diﬀerential Galois groups for Diﬀ(P1
C,S)
1. (P1, {0, ∞}) and equations of order two.
The list of possible groups G ⊂SL(2) coincides with the list given in Exam-
ples 11.18. This list is in fact the theoretical background for the simpliﬁcation
of the Kovacic algorithm for order two diﬀerential equations having at most two
singular points, presented in [231].
2. (P1, {0, 1, ∞}) and equations of order two.
Every algebraic subgroup G of GL(2) can be realized for this pair, since G/L(G)
is topologically generated by at most two elements. More precisely, every alge-
braic subgroup G ⊂GL(2) is the diﬀerential Galois group of an equation
y′′ +
a1(z)
z(z −1)y′ +
a2(z)
z2(z −1)2 y = 0,
where a1(z), a2(z) ∈C[z]. This equation is regular singular at 0, 1 and has an
arbitrary singularity at ∞.

More on Abhyankar’s Conjecture
The base ﬁeld k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0, e.g. Fp.
One considers a curve X/k (irreducible, smooth, projective) of genus g and a
ﬁnite subset S ⊂X with cardinality s ≥1. Abhyankar’s conjecture is concerned
with the Galois covers of X which are unramiﬁed outside S. For any group G we
write p(G) for the subgroup of G generated by all elements with order a power
of p. The group p(G) is a normal subgroup of G and G/p(G) is the largest
quotient of G which has no elements ̸= 1 of order p. We recall the well known
theorems.
Theorem 11.25 (M. Raynaud [243])
The ﬁnite group G is the Galois group of a covering of P1, unramiﬁed outside
∞, if and only if G = p(G).
Theorem 11.26 (D. Harbater [121])
1. Let the pair (X, S) be as above.
The ﬁnite group G is a Galois group
of a Galois cover of X, unramiﬁed outside S, if and only if G/p(G) is
generated by 2g + s −1 elements.
2. If G is a Galois group for the pair (X, S), then the natural homomorphism
π(p)(X \ S, ∗) →G/p(G) is surjective.
3. Suppose that G/p(G) is generated by 2g + s −1 elements.
Then there
is a Galois cover of X with Galois group G, wildly ramiﬁed in at most
one (prescribed) point of S, tamely ramiﬁed at the other points of S and
unramiﬁed outside S.

296
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
Remark 11.27 The group π(p)(X \ S, ∗) denotes the prime to p, algebraic
fundamental group of X \ S.
This group is known to be isomorphic to the
proﬁnite completion of the free group on 2g + s −1 generators.

In the work of P. Deligne, N. Katz and G. Laumon on (rigid) diﬀerential
equations there is also a link, this time more concrete, between diﬀerential
equations and certain sheaves living in characteristic p (see [152, 155, 156]).
Another link between the two theories is provided by recent work of B.H. Matzat
and M. van der Put [204] on diﬀerential equations in positive characteristic.
11.7
The Constructive Inverse Problem
In this section the diﬀerential ﬁeld is C(z) where C is an algebraically closed ﬁeld
of characteristic 0. The aim is to give a theoretical algorithm which produces a
linear diﬀerential equation over C(z) which has a prescribed diﬀerential Galois
group G. If the group G is not connected, then there is not much hope for an
explicit algorithm. Even for a ﬁnite group G it is doubtful whether a reasonable
algorithm for the construction of a corresponding linear diﬀerential equation
over C(z) exists. However for special cases, e.g., ﬁnite subgroups of GLn(C)
with n = 2, 3, 4, a reasonable algorithm has been developed in [232]. In this
section we describe the work of C. Mitschi and M.F. Singer [209] (see also [210])
which concerns connected linear algebraic groups. The main result is:
Theorem 11.28 (C. Mitschi and M.F. Singer [209])
Let G ⊂GL(V ) be a connected linear algebraic group over C with defect d(G)
and excess e(G). Let a1, . . . , ad(G) denote arbitrary distinct points of C. There
is an algorithm, based on the given structure of the group G, which determines
matrices A1, . . . , Ad(G) ∈End(V ) and a polynomial matrix A∞∈C[z]⊗End(V )
of degree at most e(G), such that the linear diﬀerential equation
y′ = (
A1
z −a1
+ · · · +
Ad(G)
z −ad(G)
+ A∞)y,

THE CONSTRUCTIVE INVERSE PROBLEM
297
has diﬀerential Galois group G. In particular, the points a1, . . . , ad(G) are regular
singular for this equation and ∞is possibly an irregular singular point.
Remark 11.29 This result is rather close to Corollary 11.23, since we have seen
(Corollary 11.11) that d(G) is the minimal number of topological generators for
G/L(G) There is however a diﬀerence. In Corollary 11.11 there seems to be no
bound on the degree of A∞. In the above Theorem 11.28 (only for connected
G) there a bound on the degree of A∞. The proof of the above result is purely
algebraic and moreover constructive. The special case of the theorem, where
the group G is supposed to be connected and reductive, is rather striking. It
states that G is the diﬀerential Galois group of a matrix diﬀerential equation
y′ = (A + Bz)y with A and B constant matrices. We will present the explicit
proof of this statement in case G is connected and semi-simple. This is at the
heart of [209]. The general result is then achieved by following the program
given by Kovacic in his papers [163, 164]. We refer to [209] for details.
2
Theorem 11.30 (C. Mitschi and M.F. Singer [209])
The ﬁeld C is supposed to be algebraically closed and of characteristic 0. Every
connected semi-simple linear algebraic group is the diﬀerential Galois group of
an equation y′ = (A0 + A1z)y over C(z), where A0, A1 are constant matrices.
The basic idea of the proof is simple: select matrices A0, A1 such that we
can guarantee that the Galois group of the equation is ﬁrstly a subgroup of G
and secondly is not equal to a proper subgroup of G. To guarantee the ﬁrst
property it will be enough to select A0, A1 to lie in the Lie algebra of G (see
Proposition 1.31). The second step requires more work. We present here the
simpliﬁed proof presented in [229]. We will begin by reviewing the Tannakian
approach to diﬀerential Galois theory (c.f., Appendix C).
For a diﬀerential module M (over C(z)) one denotes by {{M}} the full Tan-
nakian subcategory of DiﬀC(z) “generated” by M. By deﬁnition, the objects
of {{M}} are the diﬀerential modules isomorphic to subquotients M1/M2 of
ﬁnite direct sums of tensor products of the form M⊗· · ·⊗M⊗M∗⊗· · ·⊗M∗
(i.e., any number of terms M and its dual M∗). For any linear algebraic group
H (over C) one denotes by ReprH the Tannakian category of the ﬁnite dimen-
sional representations of H (over C). The diﬀerential Galois group of M is H if
there is an equivalence between the Tannakian categories {{M}} and ReprH.
Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C and G ⊂GL(V ) be a linear
algebraic group. Our ﬁrst aim is to produce a diﬀerential module M = (C(z) ⊗
V, ∂) and a functor of Tannakian categories ReprG →{{M}}.
The Functor ReprG →{{M}}. The Lie algebra of G will be written as
g ⊂End(V ). One chooses a matrix A(z) ∈C(z) ⊗g ⊂C(z) ⊗End(V ). There
corresponds to this choice a diﬀerential equation y′ = A(z)y and a diﬀerential
module M := (C(z)⊗V, ∂) with ∂deﬁned by ∂(v) = −A(z)v for all v ∈V . Let

298
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
a representation ρ : G →GL(W) be given. The induced maps g →End(W)
and C(z) ⊗g →C(z) ⊗End(W) are also denoted by ρ.
One associates to
(W, ρ) the diﬀerential module (C(z) ⊗W, ∂) with ∂(w) = −ρ(A(z))w for all
w ∈W. The corresponding diﬀerential equation is y′ = ρ(A(z))y. In this way
one obtains a functor of Tannakian categories ReprG →DiﬀC(z). We claim that
every (C(z) ⊗W, ∂), as above, lies in fact in {{M}}.
Indeed, consider {{V }}, the full subcategory of ReprG generated by V (the
deﬁnition is similar to the deﬁnition of {{M}}). It is known that {{V }} =
ReprG (see [82] or Appendix C.3). The representation V ⊗· · ·⊗V ⊗V ∗⊗· · ·⊗V ∗
is mapped to the diﬀerential module M⊗· · ·⊗M⊗M∗⊗· · ·⊗M∗. Let V2 ⊂V1
be G-invariant subspaces of V ⊗· · · ⊗V ⊗V ∗⊗· · · ⊗V ∗. Then V2 and V1 are
invariant under the action of g. Since A(z) ∈C(z) ⊗g, one has that C(z) ⊗V2
and C(z) ⊗V1 are diﬀerential submodules of M ⊗· · · ⊗M ⊗M∗⊗· · · ⊗M∗.
It follows that the diﬀerential module (C(z) ⊗V1/V2, ∂) lies in {{M}}. This
proves the claim.
The next step is to make the diﬀerential Galois group H of M and the equiva-
lence {{M}} →ReprH as concrete as we can.
Diﬀerential modules over O. Fix some c ∈C and let O denote the localiza-
tion of C[z] at (z−c). A diﬀerential module (N, ∂) over O is a ﬁnitely generated
O-module equipped with a C-linear map ∂satisfying ∂(fn) = f ′n + f∂(n) for
all f ∈O and n ∈N. It is an exercise to show that N has no torsion elements.
It follows that N is a free, ﬁnitely generated O-module. Let DiﬀO denote the
category of the diﬀerential modules over O. The functor N →C(z) ⊗O N in-
duces an equivalence of DiﬀO with a full subcategory of DiﬀC(z). It is easily
seen that this full subcategory has as objects the diﬀerential modules over C(z)
which are regular at z = c.
Let O = C[[z −c]] denote the completion of O. For any diﬀerential module N
over O of rank n, one writes 
N for O ⊗N. We note that 
N is a diﬀerential
module over O and that 
N is in fact a trivial diﬀerential module. The space
ker(∂, 
N) is a vector space over C of dimension n, which will be called Solc(N),
the solution space of N over C[[z −c]] (and also over C((z −c))). The canonical
map Solc(N) →
N/(z−c) 
N = N/(z−c)N is an isomorphism. Let VectC denote
the Tannakian category of the ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces over C. The
above construction N →N/(z −c)N is a ﬁbre functor of DiﬀO →VectC. For
a ﬁxed object M of DiﬀO one can consider the restriction ω : {{M}} →VectC,
which is again a ﬁbre functor. The diﬀerential Galois group H of M is deﬁned in
[82] or Appendix C.3 as Aut⊗(ω). By deﬁnition H acts on ω(N) for every object
N of {{M}}. Thus we ﬁnd a functor {{M}} →ReprH, which is an equivalence
of Tannakian categories. The composition {{M}} →ReprH →VectC (where
the last arrow is the forgetful functor) is the same as ω. (We note that the
above remains valid if we replace O by any localization of C[z] ).

THE CONSTRUCTIVE INVERSE PROBLEM
299
Remark 11.31 Let G again be an algebraic subgroup of GL(V ), let A(z) ∈
C(z) ⊗g be chosen. Suppose that the matrix A(z) has no poles at z = c. Then
we have functors of Tannakian categories ReprG →{{M}} and {{M}} →
ReprH. The last functor is made by considering M as diﬀerential module over
O. The composition of the two functors maps a representation (W, ρ) of G to
a representation of H on O/(z −c)O ⊗W which is canonically isomorphic to
W. Therefore the Tannakian approach allows us to conclude directly (without
an appeal to Proposition 1.31) that H is an algebraic subgroup of G.
2
We now return to the problem of insuring that the diﬀerential Galois group of
our equation is not a proper subgroup of G. Suppose that H is a proper subgroup
of G, then there exists a representation (W, ρ) of G and a line ˜W ⊂W such
that H stabilizes ˜W and G does not (c.f., [141], Chapter 11.2). The diﬀerential
module (C(z) ⊗W, ∂) has as image in ReprH the space W with its H-action.
The H-invariant subspace ˜W corresponds with a one-dimensional (diﬀerential)
submodule C(z)w ⊂C(z) ⊗W. After multiplication of w by an element in
C(z), we may suppose that w ∈C[z] ⊗W and that the coordinates of w with
respect to a basis of W have g.c.d. 1. Let us write
d
dz for the diﬀerentiation on
C(z) ⊗W, given by
d
dzfa = f ′a for f ∈C(z) and a ∈W. Then one ﬁnds the
equation
[ d
dz −ρ(A(z))]w
=
cw for some c ∈C(z).
(11.1)
The idea for the rest of the proof is to make a choice for A(z) which contradicts
the equation for w above.
For a given proper algebraic subgroup H′ of G
one can produce a suitable A(z) which contradicts the statement that H lies
in a conjugate of H′. In general however one has to consider inﬁnitely many
(conjugacy classes) of proper algebraic subgroups of G.
This will probably
not lead to a construction of the matrix A(z).
In the sequel we will make
two restrictions, namely A(z) is a polynomial matrix (i.e., A(z) ∈C[z] ⊗g)
and that G is connected and semi-simple.
As we will see in Lemma 11.32
the ﬁrst restriction implies that the diﬀerential Galois group is a connected
algebraic subgroup of G.
The second restriction implies that G has ﬁnitely
many conjugacy classes of maximal proper connected subgroups.
Lemma 11.32 Let W be a ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space and let A0, . . . , Am
be elements of End(W). Then the diﬀerential Galois group G of the diﬀerential
equation y′ = (A0 + A1z + · · · + Amzm)y over C(z) is connected.
Proof.
Let E denote the Picard-Vessiot ring and let Go= the component of
the identity of G. The ﬁeld F = EGo is a ﬁnite Galois extension F of C(z) with
Galois group G/Go. The extension C(z) ⊂F can be ramiﬁed only above the
singular points of the diﬀerential equation. The only singular point of the diﬀer-
ential equation is ∞. It follows that C(z) = F and by the Galois correspondence
G = Go.

CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
As mentioned above, the key to the proof of Theorem 11.30 is the existence of
G-modules that allow one to distinguish a connected semi-simple group from its
connected proper subgroups. These modules are deﬁned below.
Deﬁnition 11.33 A faithful representation ρ : G →GL(W), in other words a
faithful G-module W, will be called a Chevalley module if:
(a) G leaves no line in W invariant.
(b) Any proper connected closed subgroup of G has an invariant line.
2
We will postpone to the end of this section the proof that a connected semi-
simple G has a Chevalley module.
Proof of Theorem 11.30: We now return to the construction of a diﬀerential
equation of the form y′ = (A0 + A1z)y having as diﬀerential Galois group a
given connected semi-simple group G. We shall describe the choices for A0 and
A1 in g ⊂End(V ).
The connected semi-simple group G is given as an algebraic subgroup G ⊂
GL(V ), where V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C. We recall that G is
semi-simple if and only if its Lie algebra g is semi-simple. For the construction of
the equation we will need the root space decomposition of g. This decomposition
reads (see [107] and [142]): g = h ⊕(⊕αgα), where h is a Cartan subalgebra
and the one dimensional spaces gα = CXα are the eigenspaces for the adjoint
action of h on g corresponding to the non-zero roots α : h →C. More precisely,
the adjoint action of h on h is zero and for any α ̸= 0 one has [h, Xα] = α(h)Xα
for all h ∈h.
We ﬁx a Chevalley module ρ : G →GL(W). The induced (injective) morphism
of Lie algebras g →End(W) is also denoted by ρ. The action of h on W gives
a decomposition of W = ⊕Wβ into eigenspaces for a collection of linear maps
β : h →C. The β’s are called the weights of the representation ρ.
For A0 one chooses 
α̸=0 Xα. For A1 one chooses an element in h satisfying
conditions (a), (b) and (c) below.
(a) The α(A1) are non-zero and distinct (for the non-zero roots α of g).
(b) The β(A1) are non-zero and distinct (for the non-zero weights β of the
representation ρ.)
(c) If the integer m is an eigenvalue of the operator 
α̸=0
1
−α(A1)ρ(X−α)ρ(Xα)
on W, then m = 0.
It is clear that A1 satisfying (a) and (b) exists. Choose such an A1. If A1 does
not yet satisfy (c) then a suitable multiple cA1, with c ∈C∗, satisﬁes all three
conditions. We now claim:

THE CONSTRUCTIVE INVERSE PROBLEM
301
Let A0, A1 ∈g ⊂End(V ) be chosen as above, then the action of the
diﬀerential Galois group of y′ = (A0 + A1z)y on the solution space
can be identiﬁed with G ⊂GL(V ).
The diﬀerential Galois group of the proposed equation is a connected alge-
braic subgroup H of G by Remark 11.31 and Lemma 11.32. If H ̸= G, then
by deﬁnition the group H has an invariant line in W. Furthermore, there ex-
ists an equation similar to Equation (11.1), that is an equation [ d
dz −(ρ(A0) +
ρ(A1)z)]w = cw with c ∈C(z) and a non-trivial solution w ∈C[z] ⊗W such
that the g.c.d. of the coordinates of w is 1. It follows that c ∈C[z] and by
comparing degrees one ﬁnds that the degree of c is at most 1. More explicitly,
one has
[ d
dz −(ρ(A0) + ρ(A1)z)]w = (c0 + c1z)w,
with w = wmzm+· · ·+w1z+w0, all wi ∈W, wm ̸= 0 and c0, c1 ∈C. Comparing
the coeﬃcients of zm+1, zm, zm−1 one obtains three linear equations:
ρ(A1)(wm)
=
−c1wm
ρ(A0)(wm) + ρ(A1)(wm−1)
=
−c0wm −c1wm−1
−mwm + ρ(A0)(wm−1) + ρ(A1)(wm−2)
=
−c0wm−1 −c1wm−2.
We let Wβ be one of the eigenspaces for the action of ρ(A1) on W corresponding
to the eigenvalue b := β(A1) of ρ(A1). We will write Wb = Wβ. Any element
˜w ∈W is written as ˜w = 
b ˜wb, with ˜wb ∈Wb and where b runs over the set
{β(A1) | β is a weight} of the eigenvalues of ρ(A1). The relation [A1, Xα] =
α(A1)Xα implies that ρ(Xα)(Wd) ⊂Wd+α(A1) for any eigenvalue d of ρ(A1).
One concludes that A0 = 
α̸=0 Xα has the property ρ(A0)(Wd) ⊂⊕b̸=dWb.
We analyse now the three equations. The ﬁrst equation can only be solved with
wm ∈Wd, wm ̸= 0 and d = −c1. The second equation, which can be read as
c0wm = −ρ(A0)(wm) + (−ρ(A1) −c1)wm−1, imposes c0 = 0. Indeed, the two
right hand side terms −ρ(A0)(wm) and (−ρ(A1)−c1)wm−1 have no component
in the eigenspace Wd for ρ(A1) to which wm belongs. Further
wm−1 =

b̸=d
1
−b + dρ(A0)(wm)b + vd =

α̸=0
1
−α(A1)ρ(Xα)(wm) + vd,
for some vd ∈Wd. The third equation can be read as
−mwm + ρ(A0)(wm−1) = (−ρ(A1) −c1)wm−2.
A necessary condition for this equation to have a solution wm−2 is that the left
hand side has 0 as component in Wd. The component in Wd of the left hand
side is easily calculated to be
−mwm + (ρ(A0)(wm−1))d = (−m +

α̸=0
1
−α(A1)ρ(X−α)ρ(Xα) )(wm).

CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
Since this component is zero, the integer m is an eigenvalue of the operator

α̸=0
1
−α(A1)ρ(X−α)ρ(Xα). It follows from our assumption on A1 that m = 0.
This leaves us with the equation [ d
dz −(ρ(A0) + ρ(A1)z)]w = c1zw and w ∈W.
Since
d
dzw = 0, one ﬁnds that Cw is invariant under ρ(A0) and ρ(A1). The Lie
algebra g is generated by A0 and A1 ([49], Chap. 8, Sec. 2, Ex. 8, p. 221). Thus
Cw is invariant under g and under G. Our assumptions on the G-module W
lead to the contradiction that w = 0. The proof of Theorem 11.30 is completed
by a proof of the existence of a Chevalley module.
2
Lemma 11.34 (C. Mitschi and M.F. Singer [209]).
Every connected semi-simple linear algebraic group has a Chevalley module.
Proof.
Let the connected semi-simple closed subgroup G ⊂GL(V ) be given.
Chevalley’s theorem (see [141], Chapter 11.2) states that for any proper alge-
braic subgroup H there is a G-module E and a line L ⊂E such that H is the
stabilizer of that line. Since G is semi-simple, E is a direct sum of irreducible
modules. The projection of L to one of these irreducible components is again
a line. Thus we ﬁnd that H stabilizes a line in some irreducible G-module E
of dimension greater than one. Any subgroup of G, conjugated to H, stabilizes
also a line in E. Dynkin’s theorem [91] implies that there are only ﬁnitely many
conjugacy classes of maximal connected proper algebraic subgroups of G. One
chooses an irreducible G-module Wi, i = 1, . . . , m for each class and one chooses
an irreducible faithful module W0. Then W = W0 ⊕· · · ⊕Wm has the required
properties.

sentation on

is a Chevalley module. Here Λ2V is the second exterior power and sym2V is
the second symmetric power. Indeed, let H be a maximal proper connected
subgroup of SL3. Then H leaves a line in V invariant or leaves a plane in V

line in Λ2V invariant and in the third case H leaves a line in sym2V invariant.
Further SL3 leaves no line in W invariant.

Remarks 11.36 1. In [209], Theorem 11.28 is used to show:
Let C be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero, G a connected linear
algebraic group deﬁned over C, and k a diﬀerential ﬁeld containing C as its ﬁeld
of constants and of ﬁnite transcendence degree over C; then G can be realized
as a Galois group of a Picard-Vessiot extension of k.
2. We now give a brief history of work on the inverse problem in diﬀerential
Galois theory. An early contribution to this problem is due to Bialynicki-Birula
[35] who showed that, for any diﬀerential ﬁeld k of characteristic zero with
algebraically closed ﬁeld of constants C, if the transcendence degree of k over
C is ﬁnite and nonzero then any connected nilpotent group is a Galois group
over k. This result was generalized by Kovacic, who showed the same is true
for any connected solvable group. In [163], [164] Kovacic’s paper introduced
powerful machinery to solve the inverse problem. In particular he developed an
inductive technique that gave criteria to lift a solution of the inverse problem
for G/Ru to a solution for the full group G. Using this, Kovacic showed that
to give a complete solution of the inverse problem, one needed only solve the
problem for reductive groups (note that G/Ru is reductive). He was able to
solve the problem for tori and so could give a solution when G/Ru is such a
group (i.e., when G is solvable). He also reduced the problem for reductive
groups to the problem for powers of simple groups. The work of [211] described
in this chapter together with Kovacic’s work yields a solution to the inverse
problem for connected groups.
When one considers speciﬁc ﬁelds, more is known. As described above, Kovacic
[163, 164] characterized those connected solvable linear algebraic groups that
can occur as diﬀerential Galois groups over C((z)) and C({z}) and Ramis [234,
240, 241] gave a complete characterization of those linear algebraic groups that
occur as diﬀerential Galois groups over C({z}). The complete characterization
of linear algebraic groups that occur as diﬀerential Galois groups over C((z)) is
new.
As described in Section 5.2, Tretkoﬀand Tretkoﬀ[282] showed that any linear
algebraic group is a Galois group over C(z) when C = C, the ﬁeld of complex
numbers. For arbitrary C, Singer [269] showed that a class of linear algebraic
groups (including all connected groups and large classes of non-connected linear
algebraic groups) are Galois groups over C(z). The proof used the result of
Tretkoﬀand Tretkoﬀand a transfer principle to go from C to any algebraically
closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero. In the second edition of [182], Magid gives
a technique for showing that some classes of connected linear algebraic groups
can be realized as diﬀerential Galois groups over C(z). As described above, the

304
CHAPTER 11. INVERSE PROBLEMS
complete solution of the inverse problem over C(z) was given by Ramis and, for
connected groups over C(z), by Mitschi and Singer.
Another approach to the inverse problem was given by Goldman and Miller.
In [111], Goldman developed the notion of a generic diﬀerential equation with
group G analogous to what E. Noether did for algebraic equations. He showed
that many groups have such an equation. In his thesis [205], Miller developed
the notion of a diﬀerentially hilbertian diﬀerential ﬁeld and gave a suﬃcient
condition for the generic equation of a group to specialize over such a ﬁeld to
an equation having this group as Galois group. Regrettably, this condition gave
a stronger hypothesis than in the analogous theory of algebraic equations. This
condition made it diﬃcult to apply the theory and Miller was unable to apply
this to any groups that were not already known to be Galois groups. Another
approach using generic diﬀerential equations to solve the inverse problem for
GLn is given by L. Juan in [146].
Finally, many groups have been shown to appear as Galois groups for classical
families of linear diﬀerential equations. The family of generalized hypergeomet-
ric equations has been particularly accessible to computation, either by algebraic
methods as in Beukers and Heckmann [33], Katz [153] and Boussel [50], or by
mixed analytic and algebraic methods as in Duval and Mitschi [88] or Mitschi
[206, 207, 208]. These equations in particular provide classical groups and the
exceptional group G2. Other examples were treated algorithmically, as in Duval
and Loday-Richaud [87] or Ulmer and Weil [291] using the Kovacic algorithm
for second order equations, or in Singer and Ulmer [273]. Finally, van der Put
and Ulmer [232] give a method for constructing linear diﬀerential equations with
Galois group a ﬁnite subgroup of GLn(C).

Chapter 12
Moduli for Singular
Diﬀerential Equations
12.1
Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to produce a ﬁne moduli space for irregular singu-
lar diﬀerential equations over C({z}) with a prescribed formal structure over
C((z)). In Section 9.5, it is remarked that this local moduli problem, studied in
[13], leads to a set E of meromorphic equivalence classes, which can be given the
structure of an aﬃne algebraic variety. In fact E is for this structure isomorphic
to AN
C for some integer N ≥1. However, it can be shown that there does not ex-
ist a universal family of equations parametrized by E (see [227]). This situation
is somewhat similar to the construction of moduli spaces for algebraic curves of
a given genus g ≥1. In order to obtain a ﬁne moduli space one has to consider
curves of genus g with additional ﬁnite data, namely a suitable level structure.
The corresponding moduli functor is then representable and is represented by a
ﬁne moduli space (see Proposition 12.3).
In our context, we apply a result of Birkhoﬀ(see Lemma 12.1) which states
that any diﬀerential module M over C({z}) is isomorphic to C({z}) ⊗C(z) N,
where N is a diﬀerential module over C(z) having singular points at 0 and ∞.
Moreover the singular point ∞can be chosen to be a regular singularity. In con-
sidering diﬀerential modules N over C(z) with the above type of singularities,
the topology of the ﬁeld C plays no role anymore. This makes it possible to
deﬁne a moduli functor F from the category of C-algebras (i.e., the commuta-
tive rings with unit element and containing the ﬁeld C) to the category of sets.
The additional data attached to a diﬀerential module (in analogy to the level
structure for curves of a given genus) are a prescribed free vector bundle and an
ﬁxed isomorphism with a formal diﬀerential module over C((z)). The functor F
turns out to be representable by an aﬃne algebraic variety AN
C. There is a well
305

306
CHAPTER 12. MODULI FOR SINGULAR EQUATIONS
deﬁned map from this ﬁne moduli space (which is also isomorphic to AN
C) to E.
This map is analytic, has an open image and its ﬁbres are in general discrete
inﬁnite subsets of AN
C. This means that the “level” data that we have added
to a diﬀerential equation, is not ﬁnite. The “level” that we have introduced
can be interpreted as prescribing a conjugacy class of a logarithm of the local
topological monodromy matrix of the diﬀerential equation.
In Section 12.2 we introduce the formal data and the moduli functor for the
problem. A special case of this moduli functor, where the calculations are very
explicit and relatively easy, is presented in Section 12.3. The variation of the
diﬀerential Galois group on the moduli space is studied.
The construction of the moduli space for a general irregular singularity is some-
what technical in nature. First, in Section 12.4 the “unramiﬁed case” is studied
in detail. The more complicated “ramiﬁed case” is reduced in Section 12.5 to
the former one. Finally some explicit examples are given and the comparison
with the “local moduli problem” of [13] is made explicit in examples.
We note that the method presented here can be modiﬁed to study ﬁne moduli
spaces for diﬀerential equations on P 1
C with a number of prescribed singular
points and with prescribed formal type at those points.
Lemma 12.1 (G. Birkhoﬀ) Let M be a diﬀerential module over C({z}). There
is an algebraic vector bundle M on P 1(C) and a connection ∇: M →Ω(a[0] +
[∞]) ⊗M, such that the diﬀerential modules C({z}) ⊗M0 and M are iso-
morphic over C({z}) (where M0 is the stalk at the origin). If the topological
local monodromy of M is semi-simple then M can be chosen to be a free vector
bundle.
Proof.
The diﬀerential module M can be represented by a matrix diﬀerential
equation y′ = Ay such that the entries of the matrix A are meromorphic func-
tions on some neighbourhood of 0 having only poles at 0 of order ≥−a, for
some integer a ≥0. Thus M extends to a connection on some neighbourhood
U1 = {z ∈C| |z| < ϵ} of 0, having a certain singularity at 0. This connec-
tion can be written as ∇1 : M1 →Ω(a[0]) ⊗M1, where M1 is an analytic
vector bundle on U1 with rank equal to the dimension of M over C({z}). The
restriction of this connection to U ∗
1 := U1 \ {0} has no singularity and is there-
fore determined by its topological monodromy T . More precisely, let V denote
the local solution space of the connection ∇1 at the point ϵ/2 ∈U1.
Then
T : V →V is the map obtained by analytical continuation of solutions along
the circle {eiφ · ϵ/2|0 ≤φ ≤2π}. Put U2 = P 1(C) \ {0} and consider the
connection ∇2 : M2 →Ω([∞]) ⊗M2 above U2 given by the data:
(a) M2 = O ⊗C V , where O is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on U2.
(b) ∇2 is determined by the requirement that for v ∈V one has ∇2(v) =
dz
z ⊗L(v), where L : V →V is a linear map satisfying e2πiL = T .

THE MODULI FUNCTOR
307
The restrictions of the connections (Mi, ∇i), for i = 1, 2, to U ∗
1 = U1 ∩U2
are isomorphic. After choosing an isomorphism one glues to two connections
to a connection (M, ∇) on P 1(C). This connection has clearly the required
properties. We recall that the GAGA principle (see Example 6.6.5), that (M, ∇)
is the analytiﬁcation of an algebraic vector bundle provided with an algebraic
connection.
In case T is semi-simple then one can take for L also a diagonal matrix. The
eigenvalues of L can be shifted over integers. This suﬃces to produces a con-
nection such that the vector bundle M is free. (See Remark 6.23.2).
2
12.2
The Moduli Functor
Let C be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0. The data on P 1(C)
for the moduli problem are:
(i) a vector space V of dimension m over C;
(ii) a formal connection ∇0 on N0 := C[[z]] ⊗V
of the form
∇0 : N0 →C[[z]]z−kdz ⊗N0 with k ≥2.
We note that k ≤1 corresponds to a regular singular diﬀerential equation and
these equations are not interesting for our moduli problem. The objects over
C, that we consider are tuples (M, ∇, φ) consisting of:
(a) a free vector bundle M on P 1(C) of rank m provided with a
connection ∇: M →Ω(k[0] + [∞]) ⊗M;
(b) an isomorphism φ : C[[z]] ⊗M0 →N0 such that (id ⊗φ) ◦∇=
∇0 ◦φ (where M0 is the stalk of M at 0).
Two objects over C, (M, ∇, φ) and (M′, ∇′, φ′) are called isomorphic if
there exists an isomorphism f : M →M′ of the free vector bundles which is
compatible with the connections and the prescribed isomorphisms φ and φ′. For
the moduli functor F from the category of the C-algebras (always commutative
and with a unit element) to the category of sets, that we are in the process of
deﬁning, we prescribe that F(C) is the set of equivalence classes of objects over
C. In the following remarks we will make F(C) more explicit and provide the
complete deﬁnition of the functor F.
Remarks 12.2 1. Let W denote the vector space H0(P 1(C), M). Then ∇is
determined by its restriction to W. This restriction is a linear map L : W →
H0(P 1(C), Ω(k[0] + [∞])) ⊗W. Further φ : C[[z]] ⊗M0 = C[[z]] ⊗W →N0 =
C[[z]]⊗V is determined by its restriction to W. The latter is given by a sequence
of linear maps φn : W →V , for n ≥0, such that φ(w) = 
n≥0 φn(w)zn holds
for w ∈W. The conditions in part (b) are equivalent to the conditions that
φ0 is an isomorphism and certain relations hold between the linear map L and

308
CHAPTER 12. MODULI FOR SINGULAR EQUATIONS
the sequence of linear maps {φn}. These relations can be made explicit if ∇0 is
given explicitly (see Section 12.3 for an example). In other words, (a) and (b)
are equivalent to giving a vector space W of dimension m and a set of linear
maps L, {φn} having certain relations.
An object equivalent to the given (M, ∇, φ) is, in terms of vector spaces and
linear maps, given by a vector space V ′ and an isomorphism V ′ →V compatible
with the other data. If we use the map φ0 to identify W and V , then we have
taken a representative in each equivalence class and the elements of F(C) can
be described by pairs (∇, φ) with:
(a’) ∇: M →Ω(k[0] + [∞]) ⊗M is a connection on the free vector
bundle M := OP 1(C) ⊗V .
(b’) φ is an isomorphism C[[z]]⊗M0 →N0 such that (id⊗φ)◦∇=
∇0 ◦φ and such that φ modulo (z) is the identity from V to itself.
2. Let R be any C-algebra. The elements of F(R) are given by:
(a’) A connection ∇: M →Ω(k[0] + [∞]) ⊗M on the free vector
bundle M := OP 1(R) ⊗V .
(b’) An isomorphism φ : R[[z]] ⊗M0 →R[[z]] ⊗N0 such that (id ⊗
φ) ◦∇= ∇0 ◦φ and such that φ modulo (z) is the identity from
R ⊗V to itself.
As in the ﬁrst remark, one can translate an object into a set of R-linear maps
L : R ⊗V →H0(P 1(R), Ω(k[0] + [∞])) ⊗V and φn : R ⊗V →R ⊗V for n ≥0,
such that φ(v) = 
n≥0 φn(v)zn for v ∈R ⊗V . The conditions are that φ0 is
the identity and the relations which translate (id ⊗φ) ◦∇= ∇0 ◦φ.

We will show that the translation of F(R) in terms of maps implies that F

13.3. ITERATIVE DIFFERENTIAL MODULES

an iterative diﬀerential module over K, which is regular outside S, has a Picard-
Vessiot extension L ⊃K which is a ﬁnite Galois extension with group G. Then
the corresponding cover Y →X is unramiﬁed outside S. In particular, according
to the work of Raynaud and Harbater (see section 11.6), Conjecture 13.12 holds
for ﬁnite groups. However we have not found an independent proof.
The conjecture can also be seen as a characteristic p analogue of Ramis’
Theorem 11.21. One of the main results of [204] is:
Theorem 13.13 The conjecture holds for (reduced) connected linear algebraic
groups over C.
A special case, which is the guiding example in the proof of Theorem 13.13, is:
The group SL2(C) can be realized as a diﬀerential Galois group for the aﬃne
line over C, i.e., X = P1
C and S = {∞}.
We note that this is a special case of the Conjecture 13.12. Indeed, one easily
veriﬁes that p (SL2(C)) = SL2(C).
13.3.3
p-Adic Diﬀerential Equations
In this subsection we will compare iterative diﬀerential equations and p-adic
diﬀerential equations. In order to avoid technical complications we simplify the
setup somewhat. In the examples we allow ourselves more freedom.
Let R0 be a complete discrete valuation ring of characteristic zero such that
pR0 is the maximal ideal of R0.
The residue ﬁeld R0/pR0 is denoted by
C.
The ﬁeld of fractions of R0 is denoted by L.
On L(z) we consider the
Gauss norm as valuation. For a polynomial  aizi this Gauss norm is deﬁned
as |  aizi|gauss = max |ai|.
For a rational function
T
N ∈L(z) one deﬁnes
| T
N |gauss = |T |gauss
|N|gauss . Let F denote the completion of L(z) with respect to the
Gauss norm. Then F is again a discretely valued ﬁeld. Let R denote the valu-
ation ring of F. Then p generates the maximal ideal of R and the residue ﬁeld
R/pR of F is equal to K = C(z).
The diﬀerentiation f →df
dz on L(z) is continuous with respect the Gauss norm
and extends uniquely to a diﬀerentiation, denoted by ∂F , on F such that ∂F R ⊂
R. A small calculation shows that for every n ≥1 one has that
1
n!∂n
F (R) ⊂R.
Moreover, the reduction of
1
n!∂n
F modulo pR coincides with the standard higher
diﬀerentiation ∂(n)
K
on K given by the formula ∂(n)
K zm =

m
n

zm−n.
A p-adic diﬀerential equation is a diﬀerential equation over the ﬁeld L(z) or over
its completion F. These equations have attracted a lot of attention, mainly be-
cause of their number theoretical aspects. B. Dwork is one of the initiators of the
subject. We will investigate the following question which is rather importance
in our context.

344
CHAPTER 13. POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC
Which p-adic diﬀerential equations can be reduced modulo p to an iterative dif-
ferential equation over K?
We need to introduce some terminology in order to formulate an answer to this
question. Let M be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over F. A norm on M is
a map ∥∥: M →R having the properties:
(i) ∥m∥≥0 for all m ∈M.
(ii) ∥m∥= 0 if and only m = 0.
(iii) ∥m1 + m2∥≤max(∥m1∥, ∥m2∥).
(iv) ∥fm∥= |f| · ∥m∥for f ∈F and m ∈M.
Any two norms ∥∥, ∥∥∗are equivalent, which means that there are positive
constants c, C such that c∥m∥≤∥m∥∗≤C∥m∥for all m ∈M. For any additive
map A : M →M one deﬁnes ∥A∥= sup{ ∥A(m)∥
∥m∥| m ∈M, m ̸= 0}. In general
∥A∥can be ∞.
An R-lattice Λ ⊂M is an R-submodule of M generated by a basis of M over
F.
Theorem 13.14 Let (M, ∂M) be a diﬀerential module over F. Let ∂(n)
M
denote
the operator
1
n!∂n
M. The following properties are equivalent.
(1) There is an R-lattice Λ ⊂M which is invariant under all ∂(n)
M .
(2) Let ∥∥be any norm on M, then supn≥0 ∥∂(n)
M ∥< ∞.
Both conditions are independent of the chosen norm. Further, condition (2) can
be made explicit for a matrix diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay with coeﬃcients in
the ﬁeld F. By diﬀerentiating this equation one deﬁnes a sequence of matrices
An with coeﬃcients in F satisfying
1
n!( d
dz)ny = Any. Let the norm of a matrix
B = (bi,j) with coeﬃcients in F be given by ∥B∥= max |bi,j|. Then condition
(2) is equivalent to supn≥0 ∥An∥< ∞.
Suppose that (M, ∂M) has the equivalent properties of Theorem 13.14. Then
the ∂(n)
M
induce maps ∂(n) on N = Λ/pΛ, which make the latter into an iter-
ative diﬀerential module over K. The next theorem states that every iterative
diﬀerential module over K can be obtained in this way.
Theorem 13.15 Let N be an iterative diﬀerential module over K. Then there
exists a diﬀerential module (M, ∂) over F and an R-lattice Λ ⊂M such that
Λ is invariant under all
1
n!∂n
M and such that the induced iterative diﬀerential
module Λ/pΛ is isomorphic to N.
Let (M, ∂) and N be as in Theorem 13.15. The diﬀerential module (M, ∂)
has a diﬀerential Galois group G over the algebraic closure L of L. The iterative
diﬀerential module N has a diﬀerential Galois group deﬁned over the algebraic
closure C of C. The two groups are clearly related. We formulate a conjecture
concerning this relation:

13.3. ITERATIVE DIFFERENTIAL MODULES
345
Conjecture 13.16 There is a group scheme G over the ring of integers O of
the algebraic closure L of L such that G ⊗O L = G and G ⊗O C contains H.
Moreover if G is a ﬁnite group then, after replacing the diﬀerential equation by
an equivalent one, the groups G and H coincide.
As we have seen above, it is not easy to produce interesting iterative diﬀeren-
tial modules. The same holds for p-adic diﬀerential modules which have the
equivalent properties of Theorem 13.14. We will discuss some examples.
Example 1. Consider the matrix diﬀerential equation y′ = Ay with A a con-
stant matrix with coeﬃcients in the algebraic closure of Qp. Then An = 1
n!An.
One can verify that supn≥0 ∥An∥< ∞is equivalent to: every eigenvalue α of A
satisﬁes |α| ≤p−1/(p−1).
Suppose now that the eigenvalues of A have this property. Let α1, . . . , αs denote
the eigenvalues of A with absolute value equal to p−1/(p−1). One can calculate
that the diﬀerential Galois group G of the equation y′ = Ay over F is equal to
the quotient of (Z/pZ)s with respect to the subgroup {(m1, . . . , ms)| |m1α1 +
· · · + msαs| < p−1/(p−1)}.
The more or less obvious reduction of y′ = Ay to an iterative diﬀerential module
over K produces a trivial iterative diﬀerential module, i.e., one with diﬀerential
Galois group {1}. This situation is not very satisfactory in view of the conjec-
ture.
The phenomenon behind this is that the straightforward reduction modulo p
of a p-cyclic extension in characteristic 0 is not a p-cyclic extension in charac-
teristic p. There is however a “deformation from Artin-Schreier to Kummer”
(compare [98] ) which can be applied here. The equation y′ = Ay has to be
replaced by an equivalent equation y′ = By. The latter reduces to an iterative
diﬀerential equation over K such that H is equal to G.
Example 2. Consider the equation y′ = Az−1y where A is a constant matrix with
coeﬃcients in the algebraic closure of Qp. This equation satisﬁes the equivalent
properties of Theorem 13.14 if and only if A is semi-simple and all its eigenval-
ues are in Zp.
Suppose that A satisﬁes this property and let α1, . . . , αs denote the distinct
eigenvalues of A. The diﬀerential Galois group G over F is equal to the sub-
group of the elements t = (t1, . . . , ts) in the torus Gs
m,L satisfying tm1
1
· · · tms
s
= 1
for all (m1, . . . , ms) ∈Zs such that m1α1 + · · · + msαs ∈Z.
The diﬀerential Galois group H of the corresponding iterative diﬀerential equa-
tion over K can be computed to be the subgroup of the torus Gs
m,C given by
the same relations.
Example 3. The hypergeometric equation reads
z(z −1)y′′ + ((a + b + 1)z −c)y′ + aby = 0.
This equation with coeﬃcients a, b, c ∈Zp has been studied extensively by

346
CHAPTER 13. POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC
B. Dwork and others. Using Dwork’s ideas (see [89], Theorem 9.2) and with the
help of F. Beukers, the following result was found.
Theorem 13.17 Put A = −a, B = −b, C = −c and let the p-adic expansions
of A, B and C be  Anpn,  Bnpn and  Cnpn. The hypergeometric equations
with parameters a, b, c satisﬁes the equivalent properties of Theorem 13.14 if for
each i one has Ai < Ci < Bi or Bi < Ci < Ai.

Appendix A
Algebraic Geometry
Aﬃne varieties are ubiquitous in Diﬀerential Galois Theory. For many results
(e.g., the deﬁnition of the diﬀerential Galois group and some of its basic prop-
erties) it is enough to assume that the varieties are deﬁned over algebraically
closed ﬁelds and study their properties over these ﬁelds. Yet, to understand
the ﬁner structure of Picard-Vessiot extensions it is necessary to understand
how varieties behave over ﬁelds that are not necessarily algebraically closed. In
this section we shall develop basic material concerning algebraic varieties taking
these needs into account while at the same time restricting ourselves only to the
topics we will use.
Classically, algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of systems of equations
{fα(X1, . . . , Xn) = 0}, fα ∈C[X1, . . . , Xn] where C is the ﬁeld of complex
numbers. To give the reader a taste of the contents of this appendix, we give
a brief description of the algebraic geometry of Cn. Proofs of these results will
be given in this appendix in a more general context.
One says that a set S ⊂Cn is an aﬃne variety if it precisely the set of zeros of
such a system of polynomial equations. For n = 1, the aﬃne varieties are ﬁnite
or all of C and for n = 2, they are the whole space or unions of points and curves
(i.e., zeros of a polynomial f(X1, X2)) . The collection of aﬃne varieties is closed
under ﬁnite intersection and arbitrary unions and so forms the closed sets of a
topology, called the Zariski topology. Given a subset S ⊂Cn, one can deﬁne
an ideal I(S) = {f ∈C[X1, . . . , Xn] | f(c1, . . . , cn) = 0 for all (c1, . . . , cn) ∈
Cn} ⊂C[X1, . . . , Xn].
A fundamental result (the Hilbert Basissatz) states
that any ideal of C[X1, . . . , Xn] is ﬁnitely generated and so any aﬃne variety
is determined by a ﬁnite set of polynomials.
One can show that I(S) is a
radial ideal, that is, if f m ∈I(S) for some m > 0, then f ∈I(S).
Given
an ideal I ⊂C[X1, . . . , Xn] one can deﬁne a variety Z(I) = {(c1, . . . , cn) ∈
Cn | f(c1, . . . , cn) = 0 for all f ∈I} ⊂Cn.
Another result of Hilbert (the
Hilbert Nullstellensatz) states for any proper ideal I ⊂C[X1, . . . , Xn], the set
349

350
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
Z(I) is not empty. This allows one to show that maps V →I(S) and I →Z(I)
deﬁne a bijective correspondence between the collection of aﬃne varieties in Cn
and the collection of radical ideals in C[X1, . . . , Xn].
Given a variety V , one can consider a polynomial f in C[X1, . . . , Xn] as a
function f : V →C. The process of restricting such polynomials to V yields a
homomorphism from C[X1, . . . , Xn] to C[X1, . . . , Xn]/I(V ) and allows one to
identify C[X1, . . . , Xn]/I(V ) with the collection of polynomial functions on V .
This latter ring is called the coordinate ring of V and denoted by C[V ]. The
ring C[V ] is a ﬁnitely generated C-algebra and any ﬁnitely generated C-algebra
R may be written as R = C[X1, . . . , Xn]/I for some ideal I.
I will be the
ideal of an aﬃne variety if it is a radical ideal or, equivalently, when R has no
nilpotent elements. Therefore there is a correspondence between aﬃne varieties
and ﬁnitely generated C-algebras without nilpotents.
More generally, if V ⊂Cn and W ⊂Cm are aﬃne varieties, a map φ : V →W is
said to be a regular map if it is the restriction of a Φ = (Φ1, . . . , Φm) : Cn →Cm,
where each Φi is a polynomial in n variables. Given an element f ∈C[W], one
sees that f ◦φ is an element of C[V ]. In this way, the regular map φ induces a
C-algebra homomorphism from C[W] to C[V ]. Conversely, any such C-algebra
homomorphism arises in this way. Two aﬃne varieties V and W are said to be
isomorphic if there are regular maps φ : V →W and ψ : W →V such that
ψ ◦φ = idV and φ ◦ψ = idW . Two aﬃne varieties are isomorphic if and only if
their coordinate rings are isomorphic as C-algebras.
We say that an aﬃne variety is irreducible if it is not the union of two proper
aﬃne varieties and irreducible if this is not the case. One sees that an aﬃne
variety V is irreducible if and only if I(V ) is a prime ideal or, equivalently,
if and only if its coordinate ring is an integral domain. The Basissatz can be
furthermore used to show that any aﬃne variety can be written as the ﬁnite
union of irreducible aﬃne varieties.
If one has such a decomposition where
no irreducible aﬃne variety is contained in the union of the others, then this
decomposition is unique and we refer to the irreducible aﬃne varieties appearing
as the components of V . This allows us to frequently restrict our attention to
irreducible aﬃne varieties. All of the above concepts are put in a more general
context in Section A.1.1.
One peculiarity of the Zariski topology is that the Zariski topology of C2 =
C×C is not the product topology. For example, V (X2
1 +X2
2) is not a the ﬁnite
union of sets of the form {pt} × {pt}, {pt} × C, C × {pt}, or C × C. We shall
have occasion to deal with products of aﬃne varieties. For example, the Galois
theory of diﬀerential equations leads one to consider the aﬃne groups G and
these are deﬁned as aﬃne varieties where the group law is a regular map from
G × G →G (as well as insisting that the map taking an element to its inverse
is a regular map G →G). To do this eﬃciently we wish to give an intrinsic
deﬁnition of the product of two varieties. In Section A.1.2, we show that for
aﬃne varieties V and W the tensor product C[V ] ⊗C C[W] of C[V ] and C[W]

351
is a C-algebra that has no nilpotent elements. We deﬁne the product of V and
W to be the aﬃne variety associated with the ring C[V ] ⊗C C[W]. If V ⊂Cn
and W ⊂Cm then we can identify V ×W with point set V ×W ⊂Cn+m. This
set is Zariski-closed and has the above coordinate ring.
The Basissatz implies that any decreasing chain of aﬃne varieties V ⊋V1 ⊋
· · · ⊋Vt ⊋. . . must be ﬁnite. One can show that the length of such a chain is
uniformly bounded and one can deﬁne the dimension of an aﬃne variety V to
be the largest number d for which there is a chain of nonempty aﬃne varieties
V ⊋V1 ⊋· · · ⊋Vd. The dimension of an aﬃne variety is the largest dimension
of its irreducible components. For an irreducible aﬃne variety V this coincides
with the transcendence degree of C(V ) over C where C(V ) is called the function
ﬁeld of V and is the quotient ﬁeld of C[V ]. These concepts are further discussed
in Section A.1.3.
Let V be an irreducible variety of dimension d and let p ∈V . We may write
the coordinate ring C[V ] as C[X1, . . . , Xn]/(f1, . . . , ft). One can show that the
matrix ( ∂fi
∂Xj (p)) has rank at most n−d. We say that p is a nonsingular point of
V if the rank is exactly n−d. This will happen at a Zariski-open set of points on
V . The Implicit Function Theorem implies that in a (euclidean) neighborhood
of a nonsingular point, V will be a complex manifold of dimension d. One can
deﬁne the tangent space of V at a nonsingular point p = (p1, . . . , pn) to be the
zero set of the linear equations
n

i=1
∂fj
∂Xi
(p)(Xi −pi) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , t .
This formulation of the notions of nonsingular point and tangent space appear
to depend on the choice of the fi and are not intrinsic. Furthermore, one would
like to deﬁne the tangent space at nonsingular points as well. In Section A.1.4,
we give an intrinsic deﬁnition of nonsingularity and tangent space at an arbi-
trary point of a (not necessarily irreducible) aﬃne variety and show that these
concepts are equivalent to the above in the classical case.
A major use of the algebraic geometry that we develop will be to describe linear
algebraic groups and sets on which they act. The prototypical example of a
linear algebraic group is the group GLn(C) of invertible n × n matrices with
entries in C. We can identify this group with an aﬃne variety in Cn2+1 via the
map sending A ∈GLn(C) to (A, (det(A))−1). The ideal in C[X1,1, . . . , Xn,n, Z]
deﬁning this set is generated by Z det(Xi,j)−1. The entries of a product of two
matrices A and B are clearly polynomials in the entries of A and B. Cramer’s
rule implies that the entries of the inverse of a matrix A can be expressed as
polynomials in the entries of A and (det(A))−1. In general, a linear algebraic
group is deﬁned to be an aﬃne variety G such that the multiplication is a regular
map from G × G to G and inverse is a regular map from G to G. It can be
shown that all such groups can be considered as Zariski closed subgroups of

352
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
GLN(C) for a suitable N. In Section A.2.1, we develop the basic properties
of linear algebraic groups ending with a proof of the Lie-Kolchin Theorem that
states that a solvable linear algebraic group G ⊂GLn, connected in the Zariski
topology, is conjugate to a group of upper triangular matrices. In Section A.2.2,
we show that the tangent space of a linear algebraic group at the identity has
the structure of a Lie algebra and derive some further properties.
In the ﬁnal Section A.2.3, we examine the action of a linear algebraic group
on an aﬃne variety. We say that an aﬃne variety V is a torsor or principal
homogeneous space for a linear algebraic group G if there is a regular map
φ : G × V →V such that for any v, w ∈V there is a unique g ∈G such that
φ(g, v) = w. In our present context, working over the algebraically closed ﬁeld
C, this concept is not too interesting. Picking a point p ∈V one sees that the
map G →V given by g →φ(g, p) gives an isomorphism between G and V .
A key fact in diﬀerential Galois theory is that a Picard-Vessiot extension of a
diﬀerential ﬁeld k is isomorphic to the function ﬁeld of a torsor for the Galois
group. The ﬁeld k need not be algebraically closed and this is a principal reason
for developing algebraic geometry over ﬁelds that are not algebraically closed.
In fact, in Section A.2.3 we show that the usual Galois theory of polynomials
can be recast in the language of torsors and we end this outline with an example
of this.
Example A.1 Consider the aﬃne variety W = {√−1, −√−1} ⊂C1 deﬁned
by X2 + 1 = 0. The linear algebraic group G = {1, −1} ⊂GL1(C) acts on
W by multiplication (g, w) →gw and this action makes W into a torsor for
G. It is easy to see that V and G are isomorphic aﬃne varieties (for example,
f(X) = √−1X deﬁnes an isomorphism). We say that an aﬃne variety V ⊂Cn
is deﬁned over k ⊂C if I(V ) ⊂C[X1, . . . , Xn] has a set of generators in k. We
deﬁne the k-coordinate ring of V to be k[V ] = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/(I∩k[X1, . . . , Xn]).
It is clear that both W and G are deﬁned over Q and Q[W] = Q[X]/(X2+1) ≃
Q(√−1), Q[G] = Q[X]/(X2 −1) ≃Q ⊕Q. The action of G on W is deﬁned
by polynomials with coeﬃcients in Q as well. On the other hand there is no
isomorphism between G and W deﬁned by polynomials over Q.
In fact, any ﬁnite group can be realized (for example via permutation matrices)
as a linear algebraic group deﬁned over Q and any Galois extension of Q with
Galois group G is the Q-coordinate ring of a torsor for G deﬁned over Q as well
(see Exercise A.50).
2
One could develop the theory of varieties deﬁned over an arbitrary ﬁeld k
using the theory of varieties deﬁned over the algebraic closure k and carefully
keeping track of the “ﬁeld of deﬁnition”. In the next sections we have chosen
instead to develop the theory directly for ﬁelds that are not necessarily alge-
braically closed. Although we present the following material ab initio, the reader
completely unfamiliar with most of the above ideas of algebraic geometry would
proﬁt from looking at [75] or the introductory chapters of [124], [213] or [261].

A.1.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Results
We will let k denote a ﬁeld and k an algebraic closure of k. Throughout Ap-
pendix A we shall assume, unless otherwise stated, that k has characteristic zero.
We shall occasionally comment on how the results need to be modiﬁed for ﬁelds
of nonzero characteristic. A k-algebra R is a commutative ring, having a unit
element 1, and containing k as a subring such that 1 ∈k. A homomorphism
φ : A →B of k-algebras is a ring homomorphism such that φ is k-linear (or
what is the same, the identity on k). A k-algebra R is called ﬁnitely generated
if there are elements f1, . . . , fn ∈R such that every element in R is a (ﬁnite)
k-linear combination of the elements f m1
1
· · · f mn
n
with all mi ∈Z, mi ≥0. The
f1, . . . , fn are called generators for R over k.
Suppose that the k-algebra R is generated by f1, . . . , fn over k. Deﬁne the ho-
momorphism of k-algebras φ : k[X1, . . . , Xn] →R by φ(Xi) = fi for all i. Then
clearly φ is surjective. The kernel of φ is an ideal I ⊂k[X1, . . . , Xn] and one has
k[X1, . . . , Xn]/I ∼= R. Conversely, any k-algebra of the form k[X1, . . . , Xn]/I is
ﬁnitely generated.
A k-algebra R is called reduced if rn = 0 (with r ∈R and n ≥1) implies that
r = 0. An ideal I in a (commutative) ring R is called radical if rn ∈I (with
n ≥1 and r ∈R) implies that r ∈I. Thus k[X1, . . . , Xn]/I is a reduced ﬁnitely
generated k-algebra if and only if the ideal I is radical.
The principal deﬁnition in this section is
Deﬁnition A.2 An aﬃne variety over k is a pair X := (max(A), A), where A
is a ﬁnitely generated k-algebra and max(A) is the set of all maximal ideals of
A. This aﬃne variety is called reduced if A is reduced.
2
Of course, the set max(A) is completely determined by A and it may seem
superﬂuous to make it part of the deﬁnition. Nonetheless, we have included
it because max(A) will be used to state many ring theoretic properties of A
in a more geometric way and so is the basic geometric counterpart of the ring
A. The set X := max(A) can be given more structure, namely a topology (see
below) and a sheaf OX of k-algebras (the structure sheaf).
Both structures
are determined by the k-algebra A. In this way one obtains a “ringed space”
(X, OX). Since A = H0(X, OX), the ringed space determines A. The more
usual deﬁnition of an aﬃne variety over the ﬁeld k is: a ringed space which
is isomorphic to the ringed space of a ﬁnitely generated k-algebra. Thus the
above deﬁnition of aﬃne variety over k is equivalent with the usual one. We have
chosen for this deﬁnition in order to simplify the exposition. One can reformulate
the above deﬁnition by saying that the category of the aﬃne varieties over k

354
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
is the opposite (i.e., the arrows go in the opposite way) of the category of the
ﬁnitely generated k-algebras.
For an aﬃne variety X, the set max(A) is provided with a topology, called the
Zariski topology. To deﬁne this topology it is enough to describe the closed sets.
A subset S ⊂max(A) is called (Zariski-)closed if there are elements {fi}i∈I ⊂A
such that a maximal ideal m of A belongs to S if and only if {fi}i∈I ⊂m. We
will use the notation S = Z({fi}i∈I).
The following statements are easily veriﬁed:
(1) If {Gj}j∈J is a family of closed sets, then ∩j∈JGj is a closed set.
(2) The union of two (or any ﬁnite number of) closed sets is closed.
(3) The empty set and max(A) are closed.
(4) Every ﬁnite set is closed.
(5) Any closed set S is of the form Z(J) for some ideal J ⊂A.
Statement (5) can be reﬁned using the Hilbert Basissatz. A commutative ring
(with 1) R is called noetherian if every ideal I ⊂R is ﬁnitely generated, i.e.,
there are elements f1, . . . , fs ∈I such that I = (f1, . . . , fs) := {g1f1 + · · · +
gsfs| g1, . . . , gs ∈R}.
Hilbert Basissatz: If R is a noetherian ring then R[x] is a
noetherian ring.
In particular, this implies that k[X1, . . . , Xn] is
noetherian and so any ﬁnitely generated k-algebra is noetherian.
We refer to [169], Ch. IV, §4 for a proof of this result. Statement (5) above
can now be restated as: Any closed set S is of the form Z(f1, . . . , fm) for some
ﬁnite set {f1, . . . , fm} ∈A.
The above deﬁnitions are rather formal in nature and we will spend some
time on examples in order to convey their meaning and the geometry involved.
Example A.3 The aﬃne line A1
k over k
By deﬁnition A1
k = (max(k[X]), k[X]). Every ideal of k[X] is principal, i.e.,
generated by a single element F ∈k[X]. The ideal (F) is maximal if and only
if F is an irreducible (non constant) polynomial. Thus the set max(k[X]) can
be identiﬁed with the set of monic irreducible polynomials in k[X]. The closed
subsets of max(k[X]) are the ﬁnite sets, the empty set and max(k[X]) itself. The
(Zariski-) open sets are the Co-ﬁnite sets and the empty subset of max(k[X]).
Suppose now that k = k. Then every monic irreducible polynomial has the form
X −a with a ∈k. Thus we can identify max(k[X]) with k itself in this case.
The closed sets for the (Zariski-) topology on k are the ﬁnite sets and k itself.
Now we consider the case where k ̸= k. Let F be a monic irreducible element
of k[X]. Since k is algebraically closed, there is a zero a ∈k of F. Consider

A.1. AFFINE VARIETIES
355
the k-algebra homomorphism φ : k[X] →k, given by φ(X) = a. The kernel
of φ is easily seen to be this maximal ideal (F).
This ideal gives rise to a
surjective map τ : k →max(k[X]), deﬁned by τ(a) is the kernel of the k-algebra
homomorphism k[X] →k, which sends X to a. The map τ is not bijective, since
a monic irreducible polynomial F ∈k[X] can have more than one zero in k. Let
us introduce on k the equivalence relation ∼by a ∼b if a and b satisfy the same
monic minimal polynomial over k. Then k/ ∼is in bijective correspondence
with max(k[X]).
2
One can generalize Example A.3 and deﬁne the n-dimensional aﬃne space
An
k over k to be An
k = (max(k[X1, . . . , Xn]), k[X1, . . . , Xn]). To describe the
structure of the maximal ideals we will need :
Hilbert Nullstellensatz: For every maximal ideal m of k[X1, . . . , Xn] the ﬁeld
k[X1, . . . , Xn]/m has a ﬁnite dimension over k.
Although this result is well known ([169], Ch. IX, §1), we shall give a proof when
the characteristic of k is 0 since the proof uses ideas that we have occasion to use
again (c.f., Lemma 1.17). A proof of this result is also outlined in Exercise A.25.
We start with the following
Lemma A.4 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, R a ﬁnitely generated in-
tegral domain over F and x ∈R such that S = {c ∈F| x −c is invertible in R}
is inﬁnite. Then x is algebraic over F.
Proof.
(Rosenlicht) We may write R = F[x1, . . . xn] for some xi ∈R and
x1 = x. Assume that x1 is not algebraic over F and let K be the quotient ﬁeld
of R. Let x1, . . . , xr be a transcendence basis of K over F and let y ∈R be
a primitive element of K over F(x1, . . . , xr). Let G ∈F[x1, . . . , xr] be chosen
so that the minimum polynomial of y over F[x1, . . . xr] has leading coeﬃcient
dividing G and x1, . . . , xn ∈F[x1, . . . xr, y, G−1]. Since S is inﬁnite, there exist
c1, . . . , cr ∈S such that G(c1, . . . , cr) ̸= 0. One can then deﬁne a homomorphism
of F[x1, . . . xr, y, G−1] to F, the algebraic closure of F, such that xi →ci for
i = 1, . . . , r. Since R ⊂F[x1, . . . xr, y, G−1], this contradicts the fact that x1−c1
is invertible in R.
2
Note that the hypothesis that F is of characteristic zero is only used when we
invoke the Primitive Element Theorem and so the proof remains valid when the
characteristic of k is p ̸= 0 and F p = F. To prove the Hilbert Nullstellensatz,
it is enough to show that the image xi of each Xi in K = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/m
is algebraic over k.
Since xi can equal at most one element of k, there are
an inﬁnite number of c ∈k such that xi −c is invertible. Lemma A.4 yields
the desired conclusion. A proof in the same spirit as above that holds in all
characteristics is given in [203].

Exercise A.5 Hilbert Nullstellensatz
1. Show that a set of polynomials {fα} ⊂k[X1, . . . , Xn] have a common zero in
some algebraic extension of k if and only if 1 /∈I, where I is the ideal generated
by {fα}.
2. Let a1, . . . , an ∈k. Show that the ideal (X1 −a1, . . . Xn −an) is a maximal
ideal in k[X1, . . . , Xn].
3.
Assume that k is algebraically closed.
Show that the maximal ideals of
k[X1, . . . , Xn] are of the form (X1 −a1, . . . Xn −an) for some ai ∈k. Hint:
If m is maximal, the Hilbert Nullstellensatz says that k[X1, . . . , Xn]/m is an
algebraic extension of k and so equal to k.
2
We now turn to description of An
k.
Example A.6 The n-dimensional aﬃne space An
k over kBy deﬁnition An
k =
(max(k[X1, . . . , Xn]), k[X1, . . . , Xn]). The Hilbert Nullstellensatz clariﬁes the
structure of the maximal ideals. Let us ﬁrst consider the case where k is al-
gebraically closed, i.e. k = k. From Exercise A.5, we can conclude that any
maximal ideal m is of the form (X1 −a1, . . . , Xn −an) for some ai ∈k. Thus
we can identify max(k[X1, . . . , Xn]) with kn. We use the terminology “aﬃne
space” since the structure of kn as a linear vector space over k is not included
in our deﬁnition of max(k[X1, . . . , Xn]).
In the general case, where k ̸= k, things are somewhat more complicated. Let
m be a maximal ideal. The ﬁeld K := k[X1, . . . , Xn]/m is a ﬁnite extension
of k so there is a k-linear embedding of K into k. For notational convenience,
we will suppose that K ⊂k. Thus we have a k-algebra homomorphism φ :
k[X1, . . . , Xn] →k with kernel m. This homomorphism is given by φ(Xi) = ai
(i = 1, . . . , n and certain elements ai ∈k). On the other hand, for any point
a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈k
n, the k-algebra homomorphism φ, which sends Xi to ai,
has as kernel a maximal ideal of k[X1, . . . , Xn]. Thus we ﬁnd a surjective map
k
n →max(k[X1, . . . , Xn]). On k
n we introduce the equivalence relation a ∼b
by, if F(a) = 0 for any F ∈k[X1, . . . , Xn] implies F(b) = 0. Then k
n/ ∼is in
bijective correspondence with max(k[X1, . . . , Xn]).
2
Exercise A.7 Radical ideals and closed sets
One considers two sets: R, the set of all radical ideals of k[X1, . . . , Xn] and Z,
the set of all closed subsets of max(k[X1, . . . , Xn]). For any closed subset V we
denote by I(V ) the ideal consisting of all F ∈k[X1, . . . , Xn] with F ∈m for all
m ∈V . For any radical ideal I we consider
Z(I) := {m ∈max(k[X1, . . . , Xn])| I ⊂m} .
1. Prove that the maps Z : R →Z and id : Z →R are inverses of each other.
Hint: Suppose that I is a radical ideal and that f ̸∈I. To prove that there is
a maximal ideal m ⊃I with f ̸∈m, consider the ideal J = (I, Y F −1) in the

A.1. AFFINE VARIETIES
357
polynomial ring k[X1, . . . , Xn, Y ]. If 1 ∈J, then
1
=
g(X1, . . . , Xn, Y ) · (Y f(X1, . . . , Xn) −1)
+

gα(X1, . . . , Xn, Y )fα(X1, . . . , Xn)
with the fα ∈I and g, gα ∈k[X1, . . . , Xn, Y ]. Substituting Y →1
f and clearing
denominators implies that f n ∈I for some positive integer n. Therefore, 1 /∈J
and so there exists a maximal ideal m′ ⊃J. Let m = m′ ∩k[X1, . . . , Xn].
2. Assume that k is algebraically closed. Deﬁne a subset X ⊂kn to be closed if
X is the set of common zeros of a collection of polynomials in k[X1, . . . , Xn]. For
any closed X ⊂kn let I(X) be the set of polynomials vanishing on X. For any
ideal I deﬁne Z(I) to be the set of common zeros in kn of the elements of I. Use
the Hilbert Nullstellensatz and part 1. to show that the maps Z and I deﬁne a
bijective correspondence between the set of radical ideals of k[X1, . . . , Xn] and
the collection of closed subsets of kn.
2
For an aﬃne variety X = (max(A), A) one writes sometimes X for the
topological space max(A) and O(X) for A. One calls O(X) or A the ring of
regular functions on X. Indeed, any g ∈A can be seen to be a function on
max(A). The value g(m) is deﬁned as the image of g under the map A →A/m.
In case k = k, each A/m identiﬁes with k, and so any g ∈A can be seen as
an ordinary function on max(A) with values in k. We shall frequently identify
g ∈O(X) with the map it induces from max(A) to A/m. For example, the
set {x ∈X | g(x) ̸= 0} denotes the set of maximal ideals in A not containing
g. Exercise A.7 implies that the intersection of all maximal ideals is {0} so the
identiﬁcation of f with the function it induces is injective. One also calls O(X)
the coordinate ring of X. A morphism X = (max(A), A) →Y = (max(B), B)
of aﬃne varieties over k, is deﬁned to be a pair (f, φ) satisfying:
1. φ : B →A is a k-algebra homomorphism.
2. f : max(A) →max(B) is induced by φ in the following manner:
for any maximal ideal m of A, f(m) = φ−1(m).
We note that since A and B are ﬁnitely generated over k, if m is a maximal
ideal of B and φ : B →A is a k-algebra homomorphism, then φ−1(m) is always
a maximal ideal of A. The Nullstellensatz implies that B/m is an algebraic
extension of k and so the induced map φ : A/φ−1(m) →B/m maps A/φ−1(m)
onto a ﬁnitely generated k-subalgebra of B/m. Therefore A/φ−1(m) is again a
ﬁeld and so φ−1(m) is again a maximal ideal.
In concrete terms, let A = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/I, B = k[Y1, . . . , Ym]/J and let
f1, . . . , fm ∈k[X1, . . . , Xn] have the property that for any G(Y1, . . . , Ym) ∈
J, G(f1, . . . , fm) ∈I. Then the map φ : B →A given by φ(Yi) = fi deter-
mines a k-homomorphism and yields a morphism from X to Y . Furthermore,
any such morphism arises in this way. If ˜f1, . . . , ˜fm ∈k[X1, . . . , Xn] also satisfy

358
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
G( ˜f1, . . . , ˜fm) = 0 for all G ∈J and ψ is deﬁned by ψ(Yi) = ˜fi, then φ and ψ
yield the same morphism if and only if fi −˜fi ∈I for i = 1, . . . , m.
We note that f is a continuous map. One sometimes uses the notations f = φ∗
and φ = f ∗. The important thing to note is that only very special continuous
maps max(A) →max(B) are of the form φ∗for some k-algebra homomorphism
φ.
Moreover, only for reduced aﬃne varieties will the topological map f :
max(A) →max(B) determine φ.
Exercise A.8 Continuous maps on max(A).Let X = (max(A), A) and Y =
(max(B), B) be reduced aﬃne varieties over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k. Then
O(X) and O(Y ) can be considered as rings of functions on the spaces max(A)
and max(B). Let f : max(A) →max(B) be a continuous map.1. Show that
there is a k-algebra homomorphism φ : B →A with f = φ∗if and only for
every b ∈B the function max(A)
f→max(B)
b→k belongs to A.2. Suppose that
f satisﬁes the condition of (1). Show that the φ with f = φ∗is unique.

Let X = (max(A), A) be a reduced aﬃne variety. A closed reduced subvariety
Y of X is deﬁned as a pair (max(A/I), A/I), where I is a radical ideal of A.

k.
2. Let V be a reduced closed subvariety of A1
k. Determine O(V ).
3. Let X := (max(A), A) be a reduced aﬃne variety and consider an f ∈A with
f ̸= 0. Deﬁne (W, O(W)) by O(W) = A[1/f] = A[T ]/(T f−1) and W ⊂max(A)
is the open subset {m|f ̸∈m} with the induced topology. Prove that (W, O(W))
is a reduced aﬃne variety and show that (W, O(W)) is isomorphic to the closed
reduced subspace (max(A[T ]/(T f −1)), A[T ]/(T f −1)) of (max(A[T ]), A[T ]).
4. Let V be a reduced aﬃne variety. Prove that there is a 1-1 relation between
the closed subsets of V and the radical ideals of O(V ).
5. Let V be a reduced aﬃne variety. Prove that there is no inﬁnite decreasing set
of closed subspaces. Hint: Such a sequence would correspond with an increasing
sequence of (radical) ideals. Prove that the ring O(V ) is also noetherian and
deduce that an inﬁnite increasing sequence of ideals in O(V ) cannot exist.
6. Let V be a reduced aﬃne variety and S a subset of V . The Zariski closure
of S is deﬁned as the smallest closed subset of V containing S. Show that the
Zariski closure exists. Show that the Zariski closure corresponds to the radical

k which satisﬁes F(X) ⊂Y .
9. Show by example that the image of a morphism f : X →A1
k is in general
not a closed subset of A1
k.
2
In connection with the last exercise we formulate a useful result about the
image f(X) ⊂Y of a morphism of aﬃne varieties: f(X) is a ﬁnite union of
subsets of Y of the form V ∩W with V closed and W open. We note that the
subsets of Y described in the above statement are called constructible. For a
proof of the statement we refer to [141], p. 33.
In the sequel all aﬃne varieties are supposed to be reduced and we will omit the
adjective “reduced”. An aﬃne variety X is called reducible if X can be written
as the union of two proper closed subvarieties. For “not reducible” one uses the
term irreducible.
Lemma A.10
1. The aﬃne variety X is irreducible if and only if O(X) has no zero divisors.
2. Every aﬃne variety X can be written as a ﬁnite union X1 ∪· · · ∪Xs of
irreducible closed subsets.
3. If one supposes that no Xi is contained in Xj for j ̸= i, then this decompo-
sition is unique up to the order of the Xi and the Xi are called the irreducible
components of X.
Proof.
1. Suppose that f, g ∈O(X) satisfy f ̸= 0 ̸= g and fg = 0. Put
X1 = {a ∈X| f(a) = 0} and X2 = {a ∈X| g(a) = 0}. Then X = X1 ∪X2 and
X is reducible. The other implication can be proved in a similar way.
2.
If X is reducible, then one can write X = Y ∪Z with the Y, Z proper
closed subsets. If both Y and Z are irreducible then we can stop. If, say, Y is
reducible then we write Y = D ∪E and ﬁnd X = Z ∪D ∪E, and so on. If this
process does not stop, then we ﬁnd a decreasing sequence of closed subsets, say
F1 ⊃F2 ⊃F3 ⊃· · · of X. By Exercise A.9.5, this cannot happen. Thus X can
be written as X1 ∪X2 ∪· · · ∪Xs, which each Xi closed and irreducible.
3. Suppose that there is no inclusion between the Xi. Let Y ⊂X be a closed
irreducible subset. Then Y = (Y ∩X1)∪· · ·∪(Y ∩Xs) and since Y is irreducible
one ﬁnds that Y = Y ∩Xi for some i. In other words, Y ⊂Xi for some i. This
easily implies the uniqueness of the decomposition.
2
Exercise A.11 Rational functions on a variety.
Let X = (max(A), A) be an aﬃne variety. We deﬁne the ring of rational func-
tions k(X) on X to be the total quotient ring Qt(A) of A. This is the localization

360
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
of A with respect to the multiplicative set of non-zero divisors of A (see Deﬁ-
nition 1.5.1(d)). Note that the deﬁnition of localization specializes in this case
to: (r1, s1) ∼(r2, s2) if r1s2 −r2s1 = 0. We say that f ∈k(X) is deﬁned at
m ∈max(Z) if there exist g, h ∈A such that f = g/h and h /∈m.
1. Show that if X is irreducible, then k(X) is a ﬁeld.
2. Show that for f ∈k(X) there exists an open dense subset U ⊂X such that
f is deﬁned at all points of X.
3. Let X = ∪t
i=1Xi be the decomposition of X into irreducible components. For
each i we have the map g ∈O(X) →g|Xi ∈O(Xi). This induces a map k(X) →
k(Xi) sending f ∈k(X) to f|Xi. Show that the map k(X) →k(X1) × . . . k(Xt)
deﬁned by f →(f|X1, . . . , f|Xt) is an isomorphism of k-algebras.
4. Show that, for f ∈k(X), f ∈A if and only if f is deﬁned at m for all
m ∈max(A). Hint: Let I ⊂A be the ideal generated by all h ∈A such that
there exists an element g ∈A with f = g/h. If f deﬁned at all m ∈max(A),
then I = (1). Therefore there exist g1, . . . , gm, h1, . . . , hm, t1, . . . , tm ∈A such
that 1 = m
i=1 tihi and, for each i, f = gi/hi. Show that f = m
i=1 tigi ∈A. 2
We end this section with the following concept. If S ⊂k[X1, . . . , Xn] is a set
of polynomials and k′ ⊃k is an extension ﬁeld of k, it is intuitively clear what
is meant by a common zero of S in (k′)n. We shall need to talk about common
zeros of a set of polynomials in any k-algebra R as well as some functorial
properties of this notion. We formalize this with the following
Deﬁnition A.12 Let k be a ﬁeld and X an aﬃne variety deﬁned over k. For
any k-algebra R, we deﬁne the set of R-points of X, X(R) to be the set of
k-algebra homomorphisms O(X) →R.
2
Examples A.13 R-points
1.
Let k = Q and let X be the aﬃne variety corresponding to the ring
Q[X]/(X2 + 1).
In this case X(Q) and X(R) are both empty while X(C)
has two elements.
2. Assume that k is algebraically closed. The Hilbert Nullstellensatz implies
that X(k) corresponds to the set of maximal ideals of O(X). (c.f., Example A.6)
2
One can show that every k-algebra homomorphism R1 →R2 induces the
obvious map X(R1) →X(R2). Furthermore, if F is a morphism from X to
Y , then F induces a map from X(R) to Y (R). In particular, an element f of
O(X) can be considered as a morphism from X to A1
k and so gives a map fR
from X(R) to A1
k(R) = R. In fact, one can show that the map R →X(R) is a
covariant functor from k-algebras to sets. This is an example of a representable
functor (see Deﬁnition B.18).

4. Assume that X is irreducible. Show that | max O(X)| < ∞if and only if

For each nonzero maximal ideal m of O(X), let 0 ̸= fm ∈m. Then g =  fm
is zero on X(k) so g = 0 contradicting O(X) being a domain. Therefore O(X)
has no nonzero maximal ideals.

A.1.2
Products of Aﬃne Varieties over k
For the construction of products of aﬃne varieties we need another technical
tool, namely tensor products over a ﬁeld k. We begin with a review of their
important properties.
Let V, W and Z be vector spaces over a ﬁeld k. A bilinear map f : V ×W →Z is
a map (v, w) →f(v, w) ∈Z, which has the properties f(v1+v2, w) = f(v1, w)+
f(v2, w), f(v, w1+w2) = f(v, w1)+f(v2, w) and f(λv, w) = f(v, λw) = λf(v, w)
for all λ ∈k. The tensor product V ⊗k W is a new vector space over k together
with a bilinear map u : V × W →V ⊗k W such that for any bilinear map
f : V × W →Z there exists a unique linear map F : V ⊗k W →Z such that
f = F ◦u (see [169], Ch. 16 for a proof that tensor products exist and are unique
as well as for a more complete discussion of the subject). For v ∈V, w ∈W we
denote u(v, w) by v ⊗w and, when this will not lead to confusion, we denote
V ⊗k W by V ⊗W. The bilinearity of u then translates as the following three
rules:
(v1 + v2) ⊗w
=
(v1 ⊗w) + (v2 ⊗w)
v ⊗(w1 + w2)
=
(v ⊗w1) + (v ⊗w2)
λ(v ⊗w)
=
(λv) ⊗w = v ⊗(λw) for all λ ∈K.
If {vi}i∈I is a basis of V and {wj}j∈J is a basis of W, then one can show that
{vi ⊗wj}i∈I,j∈J is a basis of V ⊗W.

Use the universal property of the map u to show that if {v1, . . . vn} are

Hint: for each i = 1, . . . , n let fi : V × W →W be a bilinear map such that
f(vi, w) = w and f(vj, w) = 0 if j ̸= i for all w ∈W.
2. Show that if v1, v2 ∈V \{0} and w1, w2 ∈W\{0} then v1 ⊗w1 = v2 ⊗w2

isomorphism (V2 ⊗W)/(V1 ⊗W) ∼= (V1/V2) ⊗W.

Let R1 and R2 be commutative k-algebras with a unit element. One can
deﬁne a multiplication on the tensor product R1 ⊗k R2 by the formula (r1 ⊗
r2)(˜r1 ⊗˜r2) = (r1˜r1) ⊗(r2˜r2) (one uses the universal property of u to show
that this is well deﬁned and gives R1 ⊗R2 the structure of a k-algebra). In
the special case R1 = k[X1, . . . , Xn] and R2 = k[Y1, . . . , Ym] it is easily veriﬁed
that R1 ⊗R2 is in fact the polynomial ring k[X1, . . . , Xn, Y1, . . . , Ym]. More
generally, let R1, R2 be ﬁnitely generated K-algebras. Represent R1 and R2 as
R1 = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/(f1, . . . , fs) and R2 = k[Y1, . . . , Ym]/(g1, . . . , gt).
Using the Exercise A.15.4 one can show that R1 ⊗R2 is isomorphic to
k[X1, . . . , Xn, Y1, . . . , Ym]/(f1, . . . fs, g1, . . . , gt).
We wish to study how reduced algebras behave under tensor products. Suppose
that k has characteristic p > 0 and let a ∈k be an element such that bp = a
has no solution in k. If we let R1 = R2 = k[X]/(Xp −a), then R1 and R2 are
ﬁelds. The tensor product R1 ⊗R2 is isomorphic to k[X, Y ]/(Xp −a, Y p −a).
The element t = X −Y modulo (Xp −a, Y p −a) has the property tp = 0. Thus
R1 ⊗k R2 contains nilpotent elements! This is an unpleasant characteristic p-
phenomenon which we want to avoid. A ﬁeld k of characteristic p > 0 is called
perfect if every element is a pth power. In other words, the map a →ap is a
bijection on k. One can show that an irreducible polynomial over such a ﬁeld
has no repeated roots and so all algebraic extensions of k are separable. The
following technical lemma tells us that the above example is more or less the
only case where nilpotents can occur in a tensor product of k-algebras without
nilpotents.
Lemma A.16 Let R1, R2 be k-algebras having no nilpotent elements. Suppose
that either the characteristic of k is zero or that the characteristic of k is p > 0
and k is perfect. Then R1 ⊗k R2 has no nilpotent elements.

Proof.
Suppose that a ∈R1 ⊗R2 satisﬁes a ̸= 0 and a2 = 0.
From this
we want to derive a contradiction. It is easily veriﬁed that for inclusions of k-
algebras R1 ⊂S1 and R2 ⊂S2, one has an inclusion R1 ⊗R2 →S1 ⊗S2. Thus
we may suppose that R1 and R2 are ﬁnitely generated over k. Take a k-basis
{ei} of R2. The element a can be written as a ﬁnite sum 
i ai ⊗ei with all
ai ∈R1. Let aj ̸= 0. Because aj is not nilpotent, there is a maximal ideal m of
R1 which does not contain aj. The residue class ﬁeld L := R1/m is according
to Hilbert’s theorem a ﬁnite extension of k. Since the image of a in L ⊗R2 is
not zero, we may assume that R1 is a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of k. Likewise we
may suppose that R2 is a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of k. According to the Primitive
Element Theorem [169], one can write R2 = k[X]/(F) where F is an irreducible
and separable polynomial. Then R1 ⊗R2 ∼= L[X]/(F). The latter ring has no
nilpotents since F is a separable polynomial.
2
Corollary A.17 Let k be a ﬁeld as in Lemma A.16 and let q be a prime ideal
in k[X1, . . . , Xn]. If K is an extension of k, then qK[X1, . . . , Xn] is a radical
ideal in K[X1, . . . , Xn].
Proof.
From Exercise A.15.4, one sees that K[X1, . . . , Xn]/qK[X1, . . . , Xn]
is isomorphic to k[X1, . . . , Xn]/q ⊗k K. This latter ring has no nilpotents by
Lemma A.16, so qK[X1, . . . , Xn] is radical.
2
We note that one cannot strengthen Corollary A.17 to say that if p is a prime
ideal in k[X1, . . . , Xn] then pK[X1, . . . , Xn] is a prime ideal in K[X1, . . . , Xn].
For example, X2+1 generates a prime ideal in Q[X] but it generates a non-prime
radical ideal in C[X].
We will assume that the characteristic of k is zero or that the characteristic of k
is p > 0 and k is perfect. As we have seen there is a bijective translation between
reduced aﬃne varieties over k and ﬁnitely generated reduced k-algebras. For
two reduced aﬃne varieties X1 and X2 we want to deﬁne a product X1 × X2,
which should again have the structure of a reduced aﬃne variety over k. Of
course the product An
k × Am
k should be An+m
k
. For reduced aﬃne varieties
V ⊂An
k, W ⊂Am
k
the product should be V × W, seen as reduced aﬃne
subvariety of An+m
k
. This is true, but there is the problem that V and W can
be embedded as reduced subvarieties of the aﬃne varieties Am+n
k
in many ways
and that we have to prove that the deﬁnition of the product is independent of
the embedding. This is where the tensor product comes in.
Deﬁnition A.18 Let X1, X2 be reduced aﬃne varieties over k. The product
X1 ×k X2 is the reduced aﬃne variety corresponding to the tensor product
O(X1) ⊗k O(X2).
2
We will sometimes use the notation X1 × X2 instead of X1 ×k X2 when
the ﬁeld k is clear from the context. We have veriﬁed that O(X1) ⊗k O(X2)
is a ﬁnitely generated reduced k-algebra.
Thus the deﬁnition makes sense.

364
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
If X1 and X2 are presented as reduced subvarieties V of An
k and W of Am
k
then the rings O(X1) and O(X2) are presented as k[Y1, . . . , Yn]/(f1, . . . fs) and
k[Z1, . . . , Zm]/(g1, . . . , gt) The tensor product can therefore be presented as
k[Y1, . . . , Yn, Z1, . . . , Zm]/(f1, . . . , fs, g1, . . . , gt). The ideal (f1, . . . fs, g1, . . . , gt)
is a radical ideal, since the tensor product has no nilpotent elements. The zero
set of this ideal is easily seen to be V ×W. When k is algebraically closed, then
one can identify this zero set with the cartesian product of the set of points of
V and the set of points of W.
It will be necessary to “lift” a variety deﬁned over a ﬁeld k to a larger ﬁeld
K ⊃k and this can also be done using tensor products. If V = (max(A), A)
is an aﬃne variety deﬁned over k, we deﬁne VK to be the variety (max(A ⊗k
K), A ⊗k K). Note that the k-algebra A ⊗k K has the structure of a K-algebra
where a →1 ⊗a deﬁnes an embedding of K into A ⊗k K. If we present the
ring A as k[X1, . . . , Xn]/q then Exercise A.15 implies that the ring A ⊗k K =
K[X1, . . . , Xn]/qK[X1, . . . , Xn].
In general, if k is not algebraically closed, then the product of irreducible vari-
eties is not necessarily irreducible (see Exercise A.20.3). When k is algebraically
closed this phenomenon cannot happen.
Lemma A.19 Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and let X, Y be irreducible
aﬃne varieties over k. Then X × Y is irreducible.
Proof.
Since k is algebraically closed, it is enough to show that X × Y (k)
is not the union of two proper, closed subsets. Let X × Y = V1 ∪V2 where
V1, V2 are closed sets. For any x ∈X(k), the set {x} × Y (k) is closed and
irreducible over k.
Therefore {x} × Y (k) ⊂V1 or {x} × Y (k) ⊂V2.
Let
Xi = {x ∈X |{x} × Y (k) ⊂Vi}. We claim that X1 is closed. To see this, note
that for each y ∈Y (k), the set Wy of x ∈X(k) such that x × y ∈V1 is closed
and X1 = ∩y∈Y (k)Wy. Similarly, X2 is closed. Therefore X = X1 or X = X2
and therefore either X × Y = V1 or X × Y = V2.

is a subvariety of An
k, that is, its coordinate ring is of the form k[X1, . . . Xn]/q
for some ideal q ⊂k[X1, . . . Xn]. We can then identify the points V (k) with a
subset of k
n. The Galois group Aut(k/k) acts on k
n coordinate wise.
Lemma A.21 Let k be the algebraic closure of k. An aﬃne variety V over k
is of the form Wk for some aﬃne variety W over k if and only if V (k) is stable
under the action of Aut(k/k).
Proof.
If V = Wk, then V (k) is precisely the set of common zeros of an ideal
q ⊂k[X1, . . . , Xn]. This implies that V (k) is stable under the above action.
Conversely, assume that V (k) is stable under the action of Aut(k/k) and let
O(V ) = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/q for some ideal q ∈k[X1, . . . , Xn].
The action of
Aut(k/k) on k extends to an action on k[X1, . . . Xn].
The Nullstellensatz
implies that q is stable under this action.
We claim that q is generated by
q ∩k[X1, . . . , Xn]. Let S be the k vector space generated by q ∩k[X1, . . . , Xn].
We will show that S = q. Assume not. Let {αi}i∈I be a k-basis of k[X1, . . . , Xn]
such that for some J ⊂I, {αi}i∈J is a k-basis of q ∩k[X1, . . . , Xn]. Note that
{αi}i∈I is also a k-basis of k[X1, . . . , Xn]. Let f = 
i∈I\J ciαi + 
i∈J ciαi ∈q
and among all such elements select one such that the set of nonzero ci, i ∈I\J
is as small as possible. We may assume that one of these nonzero ci is 1. For
any σ ∈Aut(k/k), minimality implies that f −σ(f) ∈S and therefore that for
any i ∈I\J, ci ∈k. Therefore 
i∈I\J ciαi = f −
i∈J ciαi ∈q ∩k[X1, . . . , Xn]
and so f ∈S.

Exercise A.22 k-morphisms deﬁned over k

σ ∈Aut(k/k).
2. We say that a morphism f : Vk →Wk is deﬁned over k if f ∗: O(W) ⊗k k →
O(V ) ⊗k k is of the form g∗⊗1 where g is a morphism from V to W. Show
that f is deﬁned over k if and only if f ∗(σ(v)) = σ(f ∗(v)), for all v ∈V (k) and
σ ∈Aut(k/k).
2
Remark A.23 Since we are using the action of the Galois group in Lemma A.21
and Exercise A.22 we need to assume that either k is a perfect ﬁeld (i.e., kp = k)
or replace k with the separable closure ksep when the characteristic is nonzero.

Dimension of an Aﬃne Variety
The dimension of an aﬃne variety X is deﬁned as the maximal number d for
which there exists a sequence X0 ⊋X1 ⊋· · · ⊋Xd of closed irreducible (non

empty) subsets of X. It is, a priori, not clear that d exists (i.e., is ﬁnite). It is
clear however that the dimension of X is the maximum of the dimensions of its
irreducible components. Easy examples are:
Examples A.24 1. If X is ﬁnite, then its dimension is 0. 2. The dimension of

subsets {0} ⊂A1
k ⊂A2

The dimension of An

One ingredient of the proof is formulated in the next exercises.
Exercises A.25 1. Integral elements
If A ⊂B are rings, we say that an element b ∈B is integral over A if it is the

(b) Show that if b belongs to a subring B′ ⊃A of B that is ﬁnitely generated as

2. Noether Normalization Theorem
In this exercise, we propose a proof of
Suppose that the ﬁeld k is inﬁnite and let R = k[x1, . . . , xn] be a
ﬁnitely generated k-algebra. Then for some 0 ≤m ≤n, there exist
elements y1, . . . , ym ∈R, algebraically independent over k such that
R is integral over k[y1, . . . , ym].
Let R = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/I for some ideal I in the polynomial ring k[X1, . . . , Xn].
(a) We say that f ∈k[X1, . . . , Xn] is in “Weierstrass form with respect to Xn”,

exists an invertible linear transformation of the form Xi →Xi + aiXn with
ai ∈k such that after this transformation the element f is in Weierstrass form
with respect to Xn. Give a proof of the Noether normalization for the ring
R = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/(g).
(b) Let f ∈I, f /∈k[X1, . . . , Xn−1]. Produce a linear change of the variables
X1, . . . , Xn as in (a) such that after this change of variables , f is in Weierstrass
form with respect to Xn. Let zi = xi + aixn and show that R is integral over
S = k[z1, . . . , zn−1]. Use induction on n to show that there exist y1, . . . , ym ∈
S, algebraically independent over k such that S is integral over k[y1, . . . , ym].
Conclude that R is integral over k[y1, . . . , ym].
Remark: The Noether Normalization Theorem is valid for ﬁnite ﬁelds as well.
If d is an integer greater than any exponent appearing in the polynomial f in
(a), then the transformation Xi →Xi + Xdi
n will transform f into a polynomial
in Weierstrass form and one can proceed as above.
(3) Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz
Deduce this result from the Noether Normalization Theorem. Hint: Let m be
a maximal ideal in k[X1, . . . , Xn] and let R = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/m. Assume R is
integral over S = k[y1, . . . , ym] with y1, . . . , ym algebraically independent over
k and m ≥1. By 1.d above, S is a ﬁeld, yielding a contradiction. Therefore, R
is integral over k and so algebraic over k.

Let X be an aﬃne variety. We say that an injective k-algebra morphism
k[X1, . . . , Xd] →O(X) is a Noether normalization if O(X) is integral over the
image of k[X1, . . . , Xd].
Proposition A.26
1.
Let X be an aﬃne variety and let k[X1, . . . , Xd] →O(X) be a Noether
normalization. Then the dimension of X is d.
2. Let X be an irreducible aﬃne variety. Then its dimension is equal to the
transcendence degree of the fraction ﬁeld of O(X) over k.
Proof.
1. We need again some results from ring theory, which carry the names
“going up” and “lying over” theorems (c.f., [10], Corollary 5.9 and Theorem
5.11, or [141]). We refer to the literature for proofs. They can be formulated as
follows:
Given are R1 ⊂R2, two ﬁnitely generated k-algebras, such that R2 is integral
over R1. Then for every strictly increasing chain of prime ideals p1 ⊂· · · ⊂ps of
R2 the sequence of prime ideals (p1 ∩R1) ⊂· · · ⊂(ps ∩R1) is strictly increasing.
Moreover, for any strictly increasing sequence of prime ideals q1 ⊂· · · ⊂qs in
R1 there is a (strictly) increasing sequence of prime ideals p1 ⊂· · · ⊂ps of R2
with pi ∩R1 = qi for all i.

368
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
This statement implies that R1 and R2 have the same maximum length for
increasing sequences of prime ideals. In the situation of Noether normaliza-
tion k[X1, . . . , Xd] ⊂O(X) where X is an aﬃne variety, this implies that the
dimensions of X and Ad
k are equal.
Finally we will prove by induction that the dimension of An
k is ≤n. Let V ⊂
An
k be a proper closed irreducible subset. Apply the Noether Normalization
Theorem to the ring O(V ) = k[X1, . . . , Xn]/I with I ̸= 0. This yields dim V ≤
n −1 and thus dim An
k ≤n.
2.
Let k[X1, . . . , Xd] →O(X) be a Noether normalization.
Then the frac-
tion ﬁeld of O(X) is a ﬁnite extension of the fraction ﬁeld k(X1, . . . , Xd) of
k[X1, . . . , Xd]. Thus the transcendence degree of the fraction ﬁeld of O(X) is
d. By 1., the dimension of X is also d.

A.1.4
Tangent Spaces, Smooth Points and Singular Points
We will again assume that the characteristic of k is either 0 or that k is a perfect
ﬁeld of positive characteristic. Let W be a reduced aﬃne variety over k. For
every f ∈O(W), f ̸= 0 the open subset U = {w ∈W| f(w) ̸= 0} of W is
again a reduced aﬃne variety. The coordinate ring of U is O(W)[1/f]. Let us
call U a special aﬃne subset of W. The special aﬃne subsets form a basis for
the Zariski topology, i.e., every open subset of W is a (ﬁnite) union of special
aﬃne subsets. Consider a point P ∈W, that is, an element of max(O(W)).
The dimension of W at P is deﬁned to be the minimum of the dimensions of
the special aﬃne neighbourhoods of P. The local ring OW,P of the point P on
W is deﬁned as the ring of functions f, deﬁned and regular in a neighborhood
of P. More precisely, the elements of OW,P are pairs (f, U), with U a special
aﬃne neighbourhood of P and f ∈O(U). Two pairs (f1, U1) and (f2, U2) are
identiﬁed if there is a pair (f3, U3) with U3 ⊂U1 ∩U2 and f3 is the restriction
of both f1 and f2. Since P is a maximal ideal, the set S = O(W) \ m is a
multiplicative set. Using the deﬁnitions of Example 1.5.1(d) one sees that OW,P
is in fact the localization S−1O(W) of O(W) with respect to S. Some relevant
properties of OW,P are formulated in the next exercise.
Exercise A.27 Local ring of a point. Show the following
1. OW,P is a noetherian ring.
2. OW,P has a unique maximal ideal, namely MP := {f ∈OW,P | f(P) = 0},
that is, OW,P is a local ring.
The residue ﬁeld k′ := OW,P /MP is a ﬁnite
extension of k. We note that k′ ⊃k is also separable because k is supposed to
be perfect if its characteristic is positive.
3. Let MP = (f1, . . . , fs) and let M 2
P denote the ideal generated by all products
fifj. Then MP/M 2
P is a vector space over k′ of dimension ≤s.

(d) Suppose that the above s is minimally chosen. Prove that s is equal to the
dimension of MP /M 2
P . Hint: Use Nakayama’s lemma: Let A be a local ring with
maximal ideal m, E a ﬁnitely generated A-module and F ⊂E a submodule such
that E = F + mE. Then E = F. ([169], Ch. X, §4).
2
The tangent space TW,P of W at P is deﬁned to be (MP /M 2
P )∗, i.e., the
dual of the vector space MP /M 2
P. The point P is called nonsingular or regular
if the dimension of the vector space TW,P coincides with the dimension of W at
P. The point P is called smooth (over k) if P is regular and the ﬁeld extension
k ⊂OW,P /MP is separable.
Remark A.28 Under our assumption that k has either characteristic 0 or that
k is perfect in positive characteristic, any ﬁnite extension of k is separable and
so the notions smooth (over k) and non-singular coincide. For non perfect ﬁelds
in positive characteristic a point can be non-singular, but not smooth over k.
2
Under our assumptions, a point which is not smooth is called singular. We give
some examples:
Examples A.29 Let k be algebraically closed.
1. We will identify An
k with kn. For P = (a1, . . . , an) ∈kn one ﬁnds that
MP = (X1 −a1, . . . , Xn −an) and MP /M 2
P has dimension n. Therefore every
point of kn is smooth.
2.
Let W ⊂k3 be the reduced aﬃne variety given by the equation X2
1 +
X2
2 + X2
3 (and suppose that the characteristic of k is not 2). Then O(W) =
k[X1, X2, X3]/(X2
1 +X2
2 +X2
3) = k[x1, x2, x3]. Consider the point P = (0, 0, 0) ∈
W. The dimension of W at P is two. The ideal MP = (x1, x2, x3) and the
dimension of MP /M 2
P is three. Therefore P is a singular point.
2
Exercise A.30 Let K be algebraically closed and let W ⊂k2 be the aﬃne
reduced curve given by the equation Y 2 + XY + X3 = 0. Calculate the tangent
space at each of its points. Show that (0, 0) is the unique singular point. Draw
a picture of a neighbourhood of that point.
2
We shall need the following two results. Their proofs may be found in [141],
Theorem 5.2.
Let W be a reduced aﬃne variety.
(a) For every point P ∈W the dimension of TW,P is ≥the dimension of W at
P.
(b) There are smooth points.
We formulate now the Jacobian criterion for smoothness:

370
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
Proposition A.31 Let W ⊂An
k be a reduced aﬃne variety and let W have
dimension d at P
= 0 ∈W.
The coordinate ring O(W) has the form
k[X1, . . . , Xn]/(f1, . . . , fm). The Jacobian matrix is given by ( ∂fi
∂xj )i=1,...,m
j=1,...,n . Let
∆1, . . . , ∆s denote the set of all the determinants of the square submatrices of
size (n −d) × (n −d) (called the minors of size n −d). Then P is smooth if and
only if ∆i(0) ̸= 0 for some i.
Proof.
The ideal MP has the form (X1, . . . , Xn)/(f1, . . . , fm) and MP /M 2
P
equals (X1, . . . , Xn)/(X2
1, X1X2, . . . , X2
n, L(f1), . . . , L(fm)), where for any
f ∈(X1, . . . , Xn) we write L(f) for the linear part of f in its expansion as
polynomial in the variables X1, . . . , Xn. From the above results we know that
the dimension of MP /M 2
P is at least d. The stated condition on the minors of
the Jacobian matrix translates into: the rank of the vector space generated by
L(f1), . . . , L(fm) is ≥n −d. Thus the condition on the minors is equivalent to
stating that the dimension of MP /M 2
P is ≤d.
2
The Jacobian criterion implies that the set of smooth points of a reduced
aﬃne variety W is open (and not empty by the above results). In the sequel we
will use a handy formulation for the tangent space TW,P . Let R be a k-algebra.
Recall that W(R) is the set of K-algebra maps O(W) →R and that every
k-algebra homomorphism R1 →R2 induces an obvious map W(R1) →W(R2).
For the ring R we make a special choice, namely R = k[ϵ] = k ·1 +k ·ϵ and with
multiplication given by ϵ2 = 0. The k-algebra homomorphism k[ϵ] →k induces
a map W(k[ϵ]) →W(k). We will call the following lemma the epsilon trick.
Lemma A.32 Let P ∈W(k) be given. There is a natural bijection between the
set {q ∈W(k[ϵ])| q maps to P} and TW,P .
Proof.
To be more precise, the q’s that we consider are the k-algebra homo-
morphisms OW,P →k[ϵ] such that OW,P
q→k[ϵ] →k is P. Clearly q maps MP
to k·ϵ and thus M 2
P is mapped to zero. The k-algebra OW,P /M 2
P can be written
as k ⊕(MP /M 2
P ). The map ˜q : k ⊕(MP /M 2
P ) →k[ϵ], induced by q, has the
form ˜q(c + v) = c + lq(v)ϵ, with c ∈k, v ∈(MP /M 2
P ) and lq : (MP /M 2
P ) →k a
k-linear map. In this way q is mapped to an element in lq ∈TW,P . It is easily
seen that the map q →lq gives the required bijection.

Basic Deﬁnitions and Results
We begin with the abstract deﬁnition. Throughout this section C will denote
an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero and all aﬃne varieties, unless
otherwise stated, will be deﬁned over C. Therefore, for any aﬃne variety, we
will not have to distinguish between max(O(W)) and W(C).

Deﬁnition A.33 A linear algebraic group G over C is given by the following
data:
(a) A reduced aﬃne variety G over C.
(b) A morphism m : G × G →G of aﬃne varieties.
(c) A point e ∈G.
(d) A morphism of aﬃne varieties i : G →G.
subject to the conditions that : G as a set is a group with respect to the
composition m, the point e is the unit element and i is the map which sends
every element to its inverse.

Let O(G) denote the coordinate ring of G. The morphisms m : G × G →G
and i : G →G correspond to C-algebra homomorphisms m∗: O(G) →O(G)⊗C
O(G) and i∗: O(G) →O(G). Note that e ∈max(O(G)) = G(C) corresponds
to a C-algebra homomorphism e∗: O(G) →C.

addition. Thus m∗maps x to x ⊗1 + 1 ⊗x and i∗(x) = −x.
2. The multiplicative group Gm (or better, Gm(C)) over C. This is as aﬃne
variety A1
C \ {0} with coordinate ring C[x, x−1]. The composition is the usual
multiplication. Thus m∗sends x to x ⊗x and i∗(x) = x−1.
3.
A torus T of dimension n.
This is the direct product (as a group and
as an aﬃne variety) of n copies of Gm(C).
The coordinate ring is O(T ) =
C[x1, x−1
1 , . . . , xn, x−1
n ], The C-algebra homomorphisms m∗and i∗are given by
m∗(xi) = xi ⊗xi and i∗(xi) = x−1
i
(for all i = 1, . . . , n).
4. The group GLn of the invertible n×n-matrices over C. The coordinate ring is
C[xi,j, 1
d], where xi,j are n2 indeterminates and d denotes the determinant of the
matrix of indeterminates (xi,j). From the usual formula for the multiplication
of matrices one sees that m∗must have the form m∗(xi,j) = n
k=1 xi,k ⊗xk,j.
Using Cramer’s rule, one can ﬁnd an explicit expression for i∗(xi,j). We do
not write this expression down but conclude from its existence that i is really a
morphism of aﬃne varieties.
5.
Let G ⊂GLn(C) be a subgroup, which is at the same time a Zariski
closed subset.
Let I be the ideal of G.
Then the coordinate ring O(G) of
G is C[xi,j, 1
d]/I. It can be seen that the maps m∗and i∗have the property
m∗(I) ⊂(C[xi,j, 1
d] ⊗I) + (I ⊗C[xi,j, 1
d]) and i∗(I) ⊂I. Therefore m∗and i∗
induce C-algebra homomorphisms O(G) →O(G) ⊗O(G) and O(G) →O(G).
Thus G is a linear algebraic group. In general, if G is a linear algebraic group

over C and H ⊂G(C) is a subgroup of the form V (I) for some ideal I ⊂O(G)
then H is a linear algebraic group whose coordinate ring is O(G)/I.
6. Every ﬁnite group G can be seen as a linear algebraic group. The coordinate
ring O(G) is simply the ring of all functions on G with values in C. The map
m∗: O(G) →O(G) ⊗O(G) = O(G × G) is deﬁned by specifying that m∗(f) is
the function on G×G given by m∗(f)(a, b) = f(ab). Further i∗(f)(a) = f(a−1).

A morphism f : G1 →G2 of linear algebraic groups is a morphism of aﬃne
varieties which respects the group structures.
In fact, every linear algebraic group G is isomorphic to a Zariski closed sub-
group of some GLn(C) ([141], Theorem 11.2). One can see this property as an
analogue of the statement: “Every ﬁnite group is isomorphic with a subgroup of

A.2. LINEAR ALGEBRAIC GROUPS
373
some Sn”.The next proposition gathers together some general facts about linear
algebraic groups, subgroups and morphisms.
Proposition A.37 Let G be a linear algebraic group.
1. The irreducible components of G are disjoint. If Go ⊂G is the irreducible
component of G which contains the point 1 ∈G, then Go is a normal open
subgroup of G of ﬁnite index.
2. If H is a subgroup of G, then the Zariski closure H of H is a Zariski
closed subgroup of G.
3. Every point of G is smooth.
4. If S is a Zariski connected subset of G containing 1, then the subgroup of
G generated by S is also connected.
5. The commutator subgroup (i.e., the group generated by all commutators
g1g2g−1
1 g−1
2 , g1, g2 ∈G) of a connected linear algebraic group is connected.
6. Let f : G1 →G2 be a morphism of linear algebraic groups. Then f(G1) is
again a linear algebraic group.
Proof.
1. Let G1, . . . , Gs be the irreducible components of G. Each of these
components contains a point not contained in any other component. For any
ﬁxed element h ∈G, let Lh : G →G be left translation by h, given by g →hg.
The map Lh is a morphism of aﬃne varieties and, given any g1, g2 ∈G there is
a unique h ∈G such that Lh(g1) = g2. From this it follows that any element
of G is contained in a unique component of G. Therefore G contains a unique
component Go containing 1. Since the components of G are disjoint, one sees
that each of these is both open and closed in G. For every h ∈G, the above
isomorphism Lh permutes the irreducible components. For every h ∈Go one
has that Lh(Go) ∩Go ̸= ∅. Therefore Lh(Go) = Go. The map i : G →G,
i.e., i(g) = g−1 for all g ∈G, is also an automorphism of G and permutes the
irreducible components of G. It follows that i(Go) = Go. We conclude that
Go is an open and closed subgroup of G. For any a ∈G, one considers the
automorphism of G, given by g →aga−1. This automorphism permutes the
irreducible components of G. In particular aGoa−1 = Go. This shows that Go
is a normal subgroup. The other irreducible components of G are the left (or
right) cosets of Go. Thus Go has ﬁnite index in G.
2. We claim that H is a group. Indeed, inversion on G is an isomorphism and
so H
−1 = H−1 = H. Moreover, left multiplication Lx on G by an element
x is an isomorphism. Thus for x ∈H one has Lx(H) = Lx(H) = H. Thus
Lx(H) ⊂H. Further, let x ∈H and let Rx denote the morphism given by right
multiplication. We then have H ⊂H and as a consequence Rx(H) ⊂H. Thus
H is a group.

374
APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
3. The results of Section A.1.4 imply that the group G contains a smooth point
p. Since, for every h ∈G, the map Lh : G →G is an isomorphism of aﬃne
varieties, the image point Lh(p) = hp is smooth.
Thus every point of G is
smooth.
4. Note that the set S ∪S−1 is a connected set, so we assume that S contains
the inverse of each of its elements. Since multiplication is continuous, the sets
S2 = {s1s2 | s1, s2 ∈S} ⊂S3 = {s1s2s3 | s1, s2, s3 ∈S} ⊂. . . are all connected.
Therefore their union is also connected and this is just the group generated by
S.
5. Note that (1) above implies that the notions of connected and irreducible are
the same for linear algebraic groups over C. Since G is irreducible, Lemma A.19
implies that G × G is connected. The map G × G →G deﬁned by (g1, g2) →
g1g2g−1
1 g−1
2
is continuous. Therefore the set of commutators is connected and
so generates a connected group.
6. Let H := f(G1). We have seen that H is a group as well. Let U ⊂H be an
open dense subset. Then we claim that U · U = H. Indeed, take x ∈H. The
set xU −1 is also an open dense subset of H and must meet U. This shows that
xu−1
1
= u2 holds for certain elements u1, u2 ∈U. Finally we use that H is a
constructible subset (see the discussion following Exercises A.9). The deﬁnition
of constructible implies that H contains an open dense subset U of H. Since H
is a group and U · U = H we have that H = H.
2
We will need the following technical corollary (c.f., [150], Lemma 4.9) in
Section 1.5.
Corollary A.38 Let G be an algebraic group and H an algebraic subgroup.
Assume that either H has ﬁnite index in G or that H is normal and G/H
is abelian.
If the identity component Ho of H is solvable then the identity
component Go of G is solvable.
Proof.
If H has ﬁnite index in G then Ho = Go so the conclusion is obvious.
Now assume that H is normal and that G/H is abelian. In this case, H contains
the commutator subgroup of G and so also contains the commutator subgroup
K of Go. By Proposition A.37 this latter commutator subgroup is connected
and so is contained in Ho. Since Ho is solvable, we have that K is solvable.
Since Go/K is abelian, we have that Go is solvable.

Let f : G1 →G2 be a morphism of linear algebraic groups. Prove that the
kernel of f is again a linear algebraic group.
3. Centers of Groups
Show that the center of a linear algebraic group is Zariski-closed.
2
Remarks A.40 If one thinks of linear algebraic groups as groups with some
extra structure, then it is natural to ask what the structure of G/H is for G a
linear algebraic group and H a Zariski closed subgroup of G. The answers are:
(a) G/H has the structure of a variety over C, but in general not an aﬃne
variety (in fact G/H is a quasi-projective variety).
(b) If H is a normal (and Zariski closed) subgroup of G then G/H is again
a linear algebraic group and O(G/H) = O(G)H, i.e., the regular functions on
G/H are the H-invariant regular functions on G.
Both (a) and (b) have long and complicated proofs for which we refer to [141],
Chapters 11.5 and 12.

Then < A > denotes the subgroup of GLn(C) generated by A. In general this

< A >. The proof of Proposition A.37 tells us that G is again a group. Prove

Deﬁnition A.42 A representation of a linear algebraic group G (also called a
em G-module) is a C-morphism ρ : G →GL(V ), where V is a ﬁnite dimensional
vector space over C. The representation is called faithful if ρ is injective.
2
We have remarked above that any linear algebraic group is isomorphic to
a closed subgroup of some GLn(C). In other words a faithful representation
always exists.
Exercise A.43 Representations.
Let G = (max(A), A) be a linear algebraic group over C. As before, m∗, i∗, e∗
are the maps deﬁning the Hopf algebra structure of A. Consider a pair (V, τ)
consisting of ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space V and a C-linear map τ : V →
A ⊗C V , satisfying the following rules:
(i) (e∗⊗idV ) ◦τ : V →A ⊗C V →C ⊗C V = V is the identity map.
(ii) The maps (m∗⊗idV )◦τ and (idA⊗τ)◦τ from V to A⊗C A⊗C V coincide.
Show that there is a natural bijection between the pairs (V, τ) and the ho-
momorphism ρ : G →GL(V ) of algebraic groups. Hint: For convenience we
use a basis {vi} of V over C. We note that the data for ρ is equivalent to a
C-algebra homomorphism ρ∗: C[{Xi,j},

det] →A and thus to an invertible ma-
trix (ρ∗(Xi,j)) with coeﬃcients in A (having certain properties). One associates
to ρ the C-linear map τ given by τvi =  ρ∗(Xi,j) ⊗vj.
On the other hand one associates to a given τ with τvi =  ai,j ⊗vj the ρ with
ρ∗(Xi,j) = ai,j.
In Appendix B2. we will return to this exercise.

We close this section with a proof of the Lie-Kolchin Theorem. Before we

3. The points of ﬁnite order are dense in G.
Proof.
(c.f. [249]) 1. Let
F(x1, . . . , xn)

∈C[x1, x−1
1 , .., xn, x−1

(A.4)
where each cν1,...,νn ∈C\{0} and (ν1, . . . , νn) ∈Zn.
We say that F is G-
homogeneous if for any (a1, . . . an) ∈G all the terms aν1
1 · · · aνn
n are equal.
We claim that any F(x) ∈C[x1, x−1
1 , . . . xn, x−1
n ] vanishing on G is the sum of G-
homogeneous elements of C[x1, x−1
1 , . . . , xn, x−1
n ], each of which also vanishes on
G. If F(x) is not homogeneous then there exist elements a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈G
such that a linear combination of F(x) and F(ax) is nonzero, contains only
terms appearing in F and has fewer nonzero terms than F. Note that F(ax)
also vanishes on G. Making two judicious choices of a, we see that F can be
written as the sum of two polynomials, each vanishing on G and each having
fewer terms than F. Therefore induction on the number of nonzero terms of F
yields the claim.
Let F ∈C[x1, x−1
1 , . . . , xn, x−1
n ] as in equation (A.4) be G-homogeneous and
vanish on G. Dividing by a monomial if necessary we may assume that one of the
terms appearing in G is 1. Since F(1, . . . , 1) = 0 we have that  cν1,...,νn = 0.
Furthermore, G-homogeneity implies that aν1

2.
The set of (ν1, . . . , νn) such that xν1

n −1 vanishes on G forms an
additive subgroup S of Zn.
The theory of ﬁnitely generated modules over
a principal ideal domain (Theorem 7.8 in Ch.
III, §7 of [169]) implies that
there exists a free set of generators {ai = (a1,i, . . . , an,i)}i=1,...,n for Zn and
integers d1, . . . , dn ≥0 such that S is generated by {diai}i=1,...,n. The map

and sends G onto the subgroup deﬁned by the equations {xdi

3. Using 2., we see it is enough to show than the points of ﬁnite order are dense
in Gm and this is obvious.

APPENDIX A. ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
Theorem A.46 (Lie-Kolchin) Let G be a solvable connected subgroup of GLn.
Then G is conjugate to a subgroup of upper triangular matrices.
Proof.
We follow the proof given in [249].
Recall that a group is solvable
if the descending chain of commutator subgroups ends in the trivial group.
Lemma A.37(6) implies that each of the elements of this chain is connected.
Since this chain is left invariant by conjugation by elements of G, each element
in the chain is normal in G. Furthermore, the penultimate element is commuta-
tive. Therefore, either G is commutative or its commutator subgroup contains
a connected commutative subgroup H ̸= {1}. We identify GLn with GL(V )
where V is an n-dimensional vector space over C and proceed by induction on
n.
If G is commutative, then it is well known that G is conjugate to a subgroup
of upper triangular matrices (even without the assumption of connectivity). If
V has a nontrivial G-invariant subspace W then the images of G in GL(W) and
GL(V/W) are connected and solvable and we can proceed by induction using
appropriate bases of W and V/W to construct a basis of V in which G is upper
triangular. Therefore, we can assume that G is not commutative and leaves no
nontrivial proper subspace of V invariant.
Since H is commutative, there exists a v ∈V that is a joint eigenvector of
the elements of H, that is, there is a character χ on H such that hv = χ(h)v
for all h ∈H. For any g ∈G, hgv = g(g−1hgv) = χ(g−1hg)gv so gv is again a
joint eigenvector of H. Therefore the space spanned by joint eigenvectors of H
is G-invariant. Our assumptions imply that V has a basis of joint eigenvectors
of H and so we may assume that the elements of H are diagonal. The Zariski
closure H of H is again diagonal and since H is normal in G, we have that H
is also normal in G. The group H is a torus and so, by Lemma A.45(2), we see
that the set of points of any given ﬁnite order N is ﬁnite. The group G acts on
H by conjugation, leaving these sets invariant. Since G is connected, it must
leave each element of order N ﬁxed. Therefore G commutes with the points of
ﬁnite order in H. Lemma A.45 again implies that the points of ﬁnite order are
dense in H and so that H is in the center of G.
Let χ be a character of H such that Vχ = {v ∈V | hv = χ(h)v for all h ∈H}
has a nonzero element. As noted above, such a character exists. For any g ∈G,
a calculation similar to that in the preceding paragraph shows that gVχ = Vχ.
Therefore, we must have Vχ = V and H must consist of constant matrices.
Since H is a subgroup of the commutator subgroup of G, we have that the
determinant of any element of H is 1. Therefore H is a ﬁnite group and so must
be trivial since it is connected. This contradiction proves the theorem.
2
Finally, the above proof is valid without the restriction that C has char-
acteristic 0. We note that the Lie-Kolchin Theorem is not true if we do not
assume that G is connected. To see this, let G ⊂GLn be any ﬁnite, noncom-
mutative, solvable group. If G were a subgroup of the group of upper triangular
matrices, then since each element of G has ﬁnite order, each element must be

379
diagonal (recall that the characteristic of C is 0). This would imply that G is
commutative.
A.2.2
The Lie Algebra of a Linear Algebraic Group
The Lie algebra g of a linear algebraic group G is deﬁned as the tangent space
TG,1 of G at 1 ∈G. It is clear that G and Go have the same tangent space
and that its dimension is equal to the dimension of G, which we denote by
r. The Lie algebra structure on g has still to be deﬁned. For convenience we
suppose that G is given as a closed subgroup of some GLn(C). We apply the
“epsilon trick” of Lemma A.32 ﬁrst to GLn(C) itself.
The tangent space g
of G at the point 1 is then identiﬁed with the matrices A ∈Mn(C) such that
1+ϵA ∈G(C[ϵ]). We ﬁrst note that the smoothness of the point 1 ∈G allows us
to use Proposition A.31 and the Formal Implicit Function Theorem to produce
a formal power series F(z1, . . . , zr) = 1+A1z1 +. . .+Arzr+ higher order terms
with the Ai ∈Mn(C) and such that F ∈G(C[[z1, . . . , zr]]) and such that the Ai
are linearly independent over C. Substituting zi = ϵ, zj = 0 for j ̸= i allows us
to conclude that each Ai ∈g. For any A = c1A1 + · · · + crAr, the substitution
zi = cit for i = 1, . . . r gives an element f = I + At + . . . in the power series ring
C[[t]] with f ∈G(C[[t]]) (see Exercise A.48, for another way of ﬁnding such an
f).
In order to show that g is in fact a Lie subalgebra of Mn(C), we extend
the epsilon trick and consider the ring C[α] with α3 = 0. From the previous
discussion, one can lift 1+ϵA ∈G(C[ϵ]) to a point 1+At+A1t2+· · · ∈G(C[[t]]).
Mapping t to α ∈C[α], yields an element 1 + αA + α2A1 ∈G(C[α]). Thus for
A, B ∈g we ﬁnd two points a = 1 + αA + α2A1, b = 1 + αB + α2B1 ∈G(C[α]).
The commutator aba−1b−1 is equal to 1 + α2(AB −BA). A calculation shows
that this implies that 1 + ϵ(AB −BA) ∈G(C[ϵ]). Thus [A, B] = AB −BA ∈g.
An important feature is the action of G on g, which is called the adjoint action
Ad of G on g. The deﬁnition is quite simple, for g ∈G and A ∈g one deﬁnes
Ad(g)A = gAg−1. The only thing that one has to verify is gAg−1 ∈g. This
follows from the formula g(1+ϵA)g−1 = 1+ϵ(gAg−1) which is valid in G(C[ϵ]).
We note that the Lie algebra Mn(C) has many Lie subalgebras, a minority of
them are the Lie algebras of algebraic subgroups of GLn(C). The ones that do
come from algebraic subgroups are called algebraic Lie subalgebras of Mn(C).

A.2.3
Torsors
Let G be a linear algebraic group over the algebraically closed ﬁeld C of char-
acteristic 0. Recall from Section A.1.2 that if k ⊃C, Gk is deﬁned to be the
variety associated to the ring O(G) ⊗C k.
Deﬁnition A.49 A G-torsor Z over a ﬁeld k ⊃C is an aﬃne variety over k
with a G-action, i.e., a morphism Gk ×k Z →Z denoted by (g, z) →zg, such
that:
1. For all x ∈Z(k), g1, g2 ∈G(k), we have z1 = z; z(g1g2) = (zg1)g2.
2. The morphism Gk ×k Z →Z ×k Z, given by (g, z) →(zg, z), is an isomor-
phism.
2
The last condition can be restated as: for any v, w ∈Z(k) there exists a
unique g ∈G(k) such that v = wg. A torsor is often referred to as a principal
homogeneous space over G.

A.2. LINEAR ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

Exercise A.50 Galois extensions and torsors of ﬁnite groups
Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero and let G be a ﬁnite group of order n. We
consider G as an aﬃne algebraic group as in Example A.34.6. Note that the
k-points of the variety G correspond to the elements of the group G. Let Z be
a G-torsor over k and assume that Z is irreducible.
1. Show that Z(k) is ﬁnite and so K = O(Z) is a ﬁeld. Hint: Use Exercise A.14
(4).
2. For each g ∈G, the map z →zg is an isomorphism of Z to itself and so gives
a k-automorphism σg of O(Z). Show that g →σg is an injective homomorphism
of G to Aut(K/k). Hint: If σg = id, then g = id on Z(k).
3. Show that K is a Galois extension of k with Galois group G. Hint: Let
[K : k] = m. Comparing dimensions, show that m = n. Since n = |G| ≤
|Aut(K/k)| ≤n, Galois theory gives the conclusion.
4. Conversely, let K be a Galois extension of k with Galois group G. For g ∈G
let σg ∈Aut(K/k) be the corresponding automorphism.
Consider the map
K ⊗k K →O(G) ⊗k K given by
f ⊗1
→

g∈G
χg ⊗σg(f)
1 ⊗h
→

g∈G
χg ⊗h
where χg ∈O(G) is the function that is 1 on g and 0 on the rest of G. Show
that this is an isomorphism. Conclude that K = O(X) for some connected
G-torsor. Hint: Since the two spaces have the same k-dimension, it suﬃces to
show that the map is injective. Let u = 
i fi ⊗hi be an element that maps
to zero. Using properties of the tensor product and noting that [K : k] = n,
we can assume that the fi are linearly independent over k. Th image of u is

g∈G χg ⊗(
i σg(fi)hi). Therefore, for each g ∈G, 
i σg(fi)hi = 0. Since
det(σg(fi)) ̸= 0 (c.f., [169], Ch. VI, §5, Cor. 5.4), each hi = 0.
2
The trivial G-torsor over k is deﬁned by Z = Gk := G⊗C k and Gk ×k Gk →Gk
is the multiplication map (g, z) →z · g. Two torsors Z1, Z2 over k are deﬁned
to be isomorphic over k if there exist a k-isomorphism f : Z1 →Z2 such that
f(zg) = f(z)g for all z ∈Z1, g ∈G. Any G-torsor over k, isomorphic to the
trivial one, is called trivial.
Suppose that Z has a k-rational point b, i.e., b ∈Z(k). The map Gk →Z, given
by g →bg, is an isomorphism. It follows that Z is a trivial G-torsor over k.
Thus the torsor Z is trivial if and only if Z has a k-rational point. In particular,
if k is algebraically closed, every G-torsor is trivial.












































D.1. THE RING OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS
425
commutative multiplicative semigroup generated by the elements of ∆and let
{θyi}θ∈Θ,i∈{1,...,n} be a set of indeterminates. One deﬁnes k{y1, . . . , yn} to be
the ring k[θyi]θ∈Θ,i∈{1,...,n}.
This ring has a structure of a ∆-ring deﬁned
by ∂j(θyi) = ∂jθyi.
We denote the set of homogeneous linear elements of
k{y1, . . . , yn} by k{y1, . . . , yn}1.
Kolchin deﬁnes ([161], Ch. IV.5) a ∆-ideal
I to be linear if I is generated (as a ∆-ideal) by a set Λ ⊂k{y1, . . . , yn}1. He
further shows that if this is the case then
I ∩k{y1, . . . , yn}1 = the k-span of {θL}θ∈Θ,L∈Λ .
(D.1)
The codimension of I ∩k{y1, . . . , yn}1 in k{y1, . . . , yn}1 is called the linear
dimension of I (which need not be ﬁnite). Let U be a universal ﬁeld over k with
constants C, that is a ∆-ﬁeld that contains a copy of every ﬁnitely generated
diﬀerential extension ﬁeld of k. Kolchin shows ([161], Ch. IV.5, Corollary 1) that
the mapping that sends any ﬁnite dimensional C-subspace V of Un to the ∆-ideal
I(V) of elements of k{y1, . . . , yn} that vanish on V is a bijective mapping onto
the set of linear ∆-ideals of ﬁnite linear dimension. Furthermore if dimC V = m
then I(V) has linear dimension m. Therefore one can say that the linear ∆-
ideals of ﬁnite linear dimension correspond to systems of homogeneous linear
partial diﬀerential equations whose solution spaces are ﬁnite dimensional.
Let us now consider the case of n = 1, that is the ∆-ring k{y}. The map
θ →θy induces a k-linear bijection ψ between k[∂1, . . . , ∂r] and k{y}1. If I is
a left ideal of k[∂1, . . . , ∂r], then ψ(I) will generate a linear ∆-ideal J in k{y}.
Equation D.1 implies that this yields a bijection between the sets of such ideals.
Furthermore, I has ﬁnite rank m if and only if J has ﬁnite linear dimension m.
Therefore, the left ideals I in k[∂1, . . . , ∂r] of ﬁnite rank correspond to systems
of homogeneous linear diﬀerential equations in one indeterminate having ﬁnite
dimensional solution spaces in U.
3. One can also study the ring of diﬀerential operators with coeﬃcients in a ring.
For example, the ring D = C[z1, . . . , zr, ∂1, . . . , ∂r] where zizj = zjzi and ∂i∂j =
∂j∂i for all i, j, and ∂ixj = xj∂i if i ̸= j and ∂ixi = xi∂i + 1 is referred to as
the Weyl algebra and leads to the study of D-modules. We refer to [38] and[74]
and the references therein for an exposition of this subject as well as [68], [69],
[183], and [253] for additional information concerning questions of eﬀectivity.
Given a left ideal J in D, one can consider the ideal I = Jk[∂1, . . . , ∂r] with
k = C(z1, . . . , zn). The holonomic rank of J (see the above references for a
deﬁnition of this quantity) is the same as the rank of I (see Chapter 1.4 of
[253]).
2
We now make the connection between k[∂1, . . . , ∂r]-modules and systems of
equations of the form
∂iu = Aiu i = 1, . . . , r
(D.2)
where u ∈km and each Ai is an m × m matrix with entries in k.Let M be a

426
APPENDIX D. PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
k[∂1, . . . , ∂r]-module and let e1, . . . , em be a k-basis of M. For each ℓ= 1, . . . r,
may write
∂ℓei
=
−

j
aj,i,ℓej
(D.3)
where Aℓ= (ai,j,ℓ) is an m × m matrix with entries in k. If u = 
i uiei ∈M,
then ∂ℓu = 
i(∂ℓ(ui) −
j ai,j,ℓuj)ei (note that ∂ℓu denotes the action of ∂ℓ
on M while ∂ℓ(u) denotes the application of the derivation to an element of the
ﬁeld). Therefore, once a basis of M has been selected and the identiﬁcation
M ≃kn has been made, we have that the action of ∂i on kn is given by
u →∂i(u)−Aiu, where ∂i(u) denotes the vector obtained by applying ∂i to each
entry of u. In particular, for u ∈kn, u is mapped to zero by the action of ∂i if and
only if u satisﬁes ∂i(u) = Aiu. Since M is a k[∂1, . . . , ∂r]-module, the actions of
∂i and ∂j commute for any i, j and so (∂i −Ai)(∂j −Aj) = (∂j −Aj)(∂i −Ai).
This is equivalent to
∂i(Aj) + AiAj = ∂j(Ai) + AjAi for all i, j.
(D.4)
These latter equations are called the integrability conditions for the operators
∂i −Ai.
Deﬁnition D.7 For i = 1, . . . , r, let Ai be an m × m matrix with coeﬃcients
in k. We say that the system of linear equations {∂iu = Aiu} is an integrable
system if any pair of matrices Ai, Aj satisfy the integrability conditions (D.4).
2
We have shown in the discussion preceding the above deﬁnition that selecting
a k-basis for a k[∂1, . . . , ∂r]-module leads to an integrable system. Conversely,
given an integrable system, one can deﬁne a k[∂1, . . . , ∂r]-module structure on
km via Equations (D.3), where the ei are the standard basis of km. The inte-
grability conditions insure that the actions of any ∂i and ∂j commute.
We end this section with a description of the terminology of integrable connec-
tions. In the ordinary case, we have encountered this in Section 6.1 and this
setting most readily generalizes to give a coordinate-free way of presenting linear
diﬀerential equations on manifolds.
In Section 6.1 we deﬁned a universal diﬀerential module but noted that for many
applications this object is too large and restricted ourselves to smaller modules.
All of these ﬁt into the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition D.8 Let C ⊂k be ﬁelds of characteristic zero with C algebraically
closed.
A special diﬀerential (Ω, d) is a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space Ω
together with a map d : k →Ωsuch that
1. The map d is C-linear and d(fg) = fd(g) + gd(f) for all f, g ∈k.

D.1. THE RING OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS
427
2. The kernel of d is C.
3. Ωis generated as a k-vector space by d(k).
4. The k-linear vector space der(k) := {l ◦d| l ∈Homk(M, k)}, consisting
of C-linear derivations on k, is closed under Lie brackets [ , ] (i.e., for
D1, D2 ∈der(k) one has that [D1, D2] := D1D2 −D2D1 ∈der(k)).
2
Consider a special diﬀerential d : k →Ω. Choose elements t1, . . . , tr ∈k such
that {dt1, . . . , dtr} is a basis of Ω. Let li : Ω→k be the k-linear map given
by li(dtj) = 1 for j = i and 0 for i ̸= j.
Put ∂i = li ◦d for i = 1, . . . , r.
Then {∂i}i is a k-basis for the Lie algebra der(k). Consider D := [∂i, ∂j]. One
veriﬁes that D(ts) = 0 for s = 1, . . . , r. Since D ∈der(k), it follows that D = 0.
Thus a special diﬀerential (Ω, d) gives rise to the ∆-ﬁeld structure on k given
by {∂1, . . . , ∂r}. This structure is special in the sense that there are elements
t1, . . . , tr ∈k such that ∂itj = 1 for j = i and 0 otherwise.
Moreover the
intersection of kernels of the ∂i is the prescribed ﬁeld C. On the other hand
a ∆-ﬁeld with ∆= {∂i}r
i=1 for which elements t1, . . . , tr ∈k exist with the
above properties and with ﬁeld of constants C, induces the special diﬀerential
d : k →Ω:= kdt1 ⊕· · · ⊕kdtr with d(f) := 
i ∂i(f)dti.
We conclude that the concept of a ∆-ﬁeld k is slightly more general than that
of a special diﬀerential.
Examples D.9 1. k is an algebraic extension of a purely transcendental exten-
sion C(t1, . . . , tr) of C and Ωis the universal diﬀerential module Ωk/C (see Sec-
tion 6.1). In this case Ωis a k-vector space of dimension r with basis dt1, . . . , dtr
and d : k →Ωis given by d(f) = ∂1(f)dt1+· · ·+∂r(f)dtr where ∂i is the unique
extension of the derivation
∂
∂ti on C(t1, . . . , tr).
2. k is an algebraic extension of C((t1, . . . , tr)), where this latter ﬁeld is deﬁned
as in Examples D.1.2. Here one can take Ωto be the k-vector space of dimension
r with basis dt1, . . . , dtr and d is deﬁned as above.
Note that Ωis not the
universal diﬀerential since there are derivations on C((t1, . . . , tr)) which are not
k-linear combinations of the ∂i.
3.
One can replace in 2. the ﬁeld C with C, the complex numbers, and
C((t1, . . . , tr)) with C({t1, . . . , tr}), the ﬁeld of fractions of the ring of con-
vergent power series (see Examples D.1.3) and construct Ωin a similar manner.
2
Deﬁnition D.10 Fix a special diﬀerential d : k →Ω. Let M denote a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space over k. A connection ∇on M is a map ∇: M →
Ω⊗k M satisfying:
1. ∇is a C-linear.

428
APPENDIX D. PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
2. ∇(λv) = d(λ) ⊗v + λ∇(v) for all λ ∈k and v ∈M.
For any k-linear map l : Ω→k and corresponding derivation l ◦d : k →k one
deﬁnes ∇l◦d := M
∇
→Ω⊗M
l⊗idM
→
M. A connection is integrable if for any two
k-linear maps l1, l2 : Ω→k one has
[∇l1◦d, ∇l2◦d] = ∇[l1◦d,l2◦d] .
2
We now show that the concept of an integrable connection is equivalent to an
integrable system of linear partial diﬀerential equations. Let (Ω, d) be a special
diﬀerential for k. We will use the notations following Deﬁnition D.8. Let (∇, M)
be a connection. One considers the partial diﬀerential operators ∇∂i : M →M
for i = 1, . . . , r. If the connection is integrable then the ∇∂i commute, since the
∂i commute. The converse is also easily veriﬁed.
As a consequence, all connections are integrable for r = 1.
D.2
Picard-Vessiot Theory and some Remarks
In this section we shall reexamine the material in the ﬁrst part of this book
and discuss to what extent the theory developed there generalizes to partial
diﬀerential equations.
Our main object of study will be an integrable system {∂iu = Aiu} where the
Ai are m × m matrices with coeﬃcients in some ∆-ﬁeld k (see Deﬁnition D.7).
We shall denote such a system with the notation ∂u = Au.
One begins this study as in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 with the study of ∆-rings and
∆-ﬁelds. As we have shown in the previous section, there is a correspondence be-
tween integrable systems and zero dimensional right ideals in k[∂1, . . . , ∂r] which
is analogous to the correspondence between diﬀerential equations Y ′ = AY and
operators L ∈k[∂]. The results of Section 1.2 carry over to the case of in-
tegrable systems.
A small diﬀerence is that one does not have a wronskian
matrix.
Nonetheless, there is a result corresponding to Lemma 1.12 that is
useful in transferring the results of Chapter 1 to the case of partial diﬀerential
equations. In Remarks D.6.2, we deﬁned Θ to be the free commutative multi-
plicative semigroup generated by the elements of ∆. We denote by Θ(s) the
set of elements of Θ of order less than or equal to s.
Lemma D.11 Let k be a ∆-ﬁeld with ﬁeld of constants C and let y1, . . . , yn be
elements of k. If these elements are linearly dependent over C then
det(θiyj)1≤i≤n,1≤j≤n = 0
(D.5)

D.2. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY AND SOME REMARKS
429
for all choices of θ1, . . . θn ∈Θ. Conversely, if Equation (D.5) holds for all
choices of θ1, . . . , θn with θi ∈Θ(i −1), 1 ≤i ≤n, then y1, . . . , yn are linearly
dependent over C.
Proof.
If n
i=1 ciyi = 0 for c1, . . . , cn ∈C not all zero, then n
i=1 ciθyi = 0
for all θ ∈Θ so Equation (D.5) holds.
We prove the converse by induction on n. We may assume that n > 1 and that
there exist θ′
i ∈Θ(i −1), 1 ≤i ≤n −1, such that det N ̸= 0 where
N = (θiyj)1≤i≤n−1,1≤j≤n−1 .
Under our assumption, this implies that the matrix
M = (θyj)θ∈Θ(n−1),1≤j≤n−1
has rank precisely n −1. Therefore, the space V of vectors (d1, . . . , dn) ∈kn
such that n
j=1 djθyj = 0 for all θ ∈Θ(n −1) has dimension 1. Let (c1, . . . , cn)
be an element of V with some cj = 1. For any ∂∈∆we have that
0 = ∂(
n

j=1
cjθyj) =
n

j=1
∂(cj)θyj +
n

j=1
cj∂θyj .
However, if θ ∈Θ(n −2) then ∂θ ∈Θ(n −1) and so n
j=1 ∂(cj)θyj = 0. In
particular this holds for θ = θ′
i, 1 ≤i ≤n−1, as deﬁned above. Since any row of
M is a k-linear combination of the rows (θ′
iy1, . . . , θ′
iyn), 1 ≤i ≤n −1, we have
that n
j=1 ∂(cj)θyj = 0 for any θ ∈Θ(n−1). Therefore, (∂(c1), . . . , ∂(cn)) ∈V
and we can conclude that (∂(c1), . . . , ∂(cn)) is a k-multiple of (c1, . . . , cn). Since
cj = 1 and ∂(cj) = 0, we have that each ∂(ci) = 0. This holds for all ∂∈∆so
each ci ∈C.
2
Remark D.12 1. In [161], Kolchin proves a result (Ch. II, Theorem 1) that
gives criteria similar to Lemma D.11 for a set of n elements in kt to be lin-
early dependent over C. The above result gives these criteria for t = 1 and the
proof is the same as Kolchin’s but specialized to this situation. Lemma D.11
is suﬃcient for the Galois theory of partial diﬀerential equations. For exam-
ple, Corollary 1.40 can be stated and proven for partial diﬀerential Picard-
Vessiot extensions. In this case, the use of the wronksian matrix W(y1, . . . , yn)
and reference to Lemma 1.12 are replaced by a nonsingular matrix of the form
(θiyj)1≤i≤n,1≤j≤n for some θi ∈Θ(i −1), 1 ≤i ≤n.
2
Exercise D.13 Let d : k →Ωbe a special diﬀerential and ∇: M →Ω⊗k M
an integrable connection.
Adapt the proof of 1.7 in order to show that the
dimension of the C-vector space {m ∈M| ∇m = 0} is less than or equal to the
dimension of M over k.

430
APPENDIX D. PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
We now turn to the Picard-Vessiot theory of integrable systems. The ﬁeld of
constants C of the ∆-ﬁeld is supposed to be algebraically closed of characteristic
0. Analogous to the ordinary case (Deﬁnition 1.15), one deﬁnes
Deﬁnition D.14 A Picard-Vessiot ring over k for the system ∂u = Au, is a
∆-ring over k satisfying:
1. R is a simple ∆-ring, i.e., the only ∆-ideals are R and (0).
2. There exists a fundamental matrix B for ∂u −A with coeﬃcients in R,
i.e., a matrix B ∈GLm(R) satisfying ∂iB = AiB for i = 1, . . . , r.
3. R is generated as a ring by k, the entries of a fundamental matrix B and
the inverse of the determinant of B.
2
All of the results of Chapter 1 remain true for integrable systems and the proofs
in this context are easy modiﬁcations of the proofs given there.
1. Picard-Vessiot extensions exist and are unique up to k-isomorphism.
2. If R is a Picard-Vessiot ring then the set of ∆-k-algebra automorphisms (k-
algebra automorphisms σ of R such that ∂i(σ(f)) = σ(∂i(f)) for all f ∈R)
has a natural structure of a linear algebraic group. This group is called
the diﬀerential Galois group of the ∂−A and is denoted by Aut∆(R/k).
In particular, if V = {v ∈Rm | ∂iv = Aiv for all i = 1, . . . r} then V is left
invariant by Aut∆(R/k) and the image of Aut∆(R/k) is a Zariski-closed
subgroup of GL(V ).
3. We deﬁne a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld for the integrable system ∂−A to be
the ﬁeld of fractions of a Picard-Vessiot ring for this equation.
As in
Proposition 1.22, one has that a ∆-ﬁeld L ⊃k is a Picard-Vessiot ﬁeld
for ∂−A if and only if the ﬁeld of constants of of L is C, there exists
a fundamental matrix B ∈GLm(L) for this equation and L is generated
over k by the entries of B.
4. There is a Galois correspondence precisely as described in Proposition 1.34.
5. As in 1.28, one can show that a Picard-Vessiot ring over a ﬁeld k is the
coordinate ring of a G-torsor, where G is the Galois group of the equation.
6. Given ∆-ﬁelds k ⊂K, one can deﬁne t ∈K to be an integral (of an
element of k) if ∂t ∈k for all ∂∈∆. Similarly, one can deﬁne an element
t ∈K to be an exponential (of an integral of an element of k) if ∂t/t ∈k
for all ∂∈∆. With these deﬁnitions, the results of Section 1.5 can be
generalized to ∆-ﬁelds. In particular, Theorem 1.43 holds.

D.2. PICARD-VESSIOT THEORY AND SOME REMARKS
431
In [161], Kolchin develops a Galois theory for linear diﬀerential ideals in
k{y1, . . . , yr} of ﬁnite linear dimension and shows in Chapter VI.6 that Picard-
Vessiot extensions for such an ideal are always generated by a fundamental
system of zeroes of such an ideal where r can be taken to be equal to 1. Therefore
the theory outlined here is equivalent to Kolchin’s theory.
We ﬁnish this appendix with some remarks concerning other aspects of connec-
tions. For integrable connections, or more generally for k[∂1, . . . , ∂r]-modules,
one can clearly deﬁne the notions of homomorphism, direct sums, tensor prod-
uct, etc.
The Tannakian equivalence of Theorem 2.33 remains valid for an
integrable connection (∇, M) and its diﬀerential Galois group G. In particular,
the results in Chapter 2 relating the behaviour of diﬀerential modules and that
of the diﬀerential Galois group (e.g., reducibility, complete reducibility) remain
valid in the context of integrable connections.
The formal theory concerns the ﬁeld k = C((t1, . . . , tr)) and the special
diﬀerential d : k →Ω= kdt1 ⊕· · · ⊕kdtr (see Examples D.9). No general
version of Theorem 3.1 for (formal) integrable connections is known. However,
there are classiﬁcations of integrable systems of a very special form in [95, 65]
and there are some more general ideas in [184] (see also [185]).
Very little has been written concerning algorithms similar to those in Chap-
ter 4 for integrable systems. Algorithms to ﬁnd rational solutions of integrable
systems appear in [173] and [214], (see also [63] and [64]). An algorithm to ﬁnd
solutions of integrable systems all of whose logarithmic derivatives are rational
can be found in [173]. Algorithmic questions concerning the reducibility of an
integrable system are dealt with in [286] (see also [285]).
As in the one-dimensional case, the analytic theory of integrable connec-
tions, without singularities, on a complex analytic manifold is related to local
systems and representations of the fundamental group. Regular singular inte-
grable connections were ﬁrst presented in [80]. In this book Deligne investigates
the basic properties of connections with regular singularities and gives a solu-
tion of the weak Riemann-Hilbert Problem. This theory is further developed
in [191]. Meromorphic integrable connections with irregular singularities and
their asymptotic properties are treated in [193, 195], [251, 252] and [185].
