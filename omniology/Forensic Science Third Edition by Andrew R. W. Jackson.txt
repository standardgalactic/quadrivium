Chapter objectives 
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
> List the information that may be provided by an examination of a crime scene.
> Describe how a crime scene may be preserved.
> Understand the reasons for recording a crime scene and describe the means by 
which this may be achieved.
> Review the general principles and processes involved in the search for items of 
physical evidence and their collection, packaging, labelling and storage.
> Understand and describe the principal roles of the key personnel involved in crime 
scene processing.
> Appreciate the pivotal importance of crime scene processing in the successful 
application of methods of forensic science to the solution of crime.
> Understand the potential importance of digital evidence and what actions should 
be taken when digital devices are located at a crime scene.
Introduction
As introduced in Chapter 1 (Section 1.1.2), Locard’s exchange principle states that 
‘every contact leaves a trace’. From this it follows that the perpetrator of a crime 
will not only take traces of the crime scene away with him or her but also leave 
traces of his or her presence behind. For this reason, all forensic science starts at 
the crime scene. It is from here that items of physical and digital evidence that will 
be examined by forensic scientists are retrieved. The way in which scenes of crime 
are managed and recorded, and how the physical and digital evidence is located, 
collected, packaged, labelled and stored, are all fundamental to the success of 
subsequent forensic examinations. This chapter explores the principles, methods 
and procedures involved in the processing of crime scenes in general. More detailed 
information about the processing of fire scenes and explosion scenes is given in 
Chapters 10 and 11 respectively.

Figure 6.7  Separating DNA molecules according to their length: gel electrophoresis
(a) DNA samples containing fragments of DNA are loaded into wells on the gel. In this example, the DNA fragments 
are from an STR, repeat mutation; sample A is from individual A with 2 and 6 repeats, and sample B is from 
individual B with 3 and 8 repeats. Also on the gel are loaded, into well 3, DNA standards of known size: this allows 
the size of unknown fragments to be determined by comparison. (b) Application of a voltage across the gel causes 
the DNA to migrate towards the anode and separate according to the length of the molecules. In the gel, the DNA is 
visualised by staining with coloured dyes that bind to it. The DNA appears as bands of colour: each band consists of 
a very large number of DNA molecules of the same length. (c) Capillary electrophoresis (CE): in modern methodology, 
the gel material is in a very fine capillary tube; the DNA is labelled by having fluorescent molecules (tags) attached 
to it during the PCR and is visualised when the laser, shone through a clear section of the capillary tube, causes the 
migrating DNA to fluoresce – this is detected by a CCD camera and the information passes to a computer. (d) Data 
from capillary electrophoresis are shown as an electropherogram. Note that the three samples shown would have 
been run separately along the capillary
In lane 3, a set of markers can be loaded so
that the size of the fragments can be determined

­354  n  EXPLOSIONS AND EXPLOSIVES
an inert absorbent such as kieselguhr (a diatomaceous earth – a geological material 
produced by the sedimentary deposition of diatoms’ skeletons) to form dynamite 
(known as straight dynamite in the United States).
 
Explosions due to chemical reactions can be subdivided into two types, namely 
deflagrations and detonations. During a deflagration, the speed at which the 
reaction front moves through the explosive is less than the speed of sound in that 
material. In a detonation, the speed at which the reaction front moves through the 
explosive is greater than the speed of sound in that material.
 
High explosives are ones that normally detonate, and thereby produce a 
shattering effect. They are used in both military and industrial applications where 
blast is required. High explosives do not normally need to be confined in a container 
in order to explode. However, a number of military munitions are normally filled 
with this type of explosive, including shells, mines, bombs and grenades. When they 
explode, such munitions produce both blast and rapidly moving fragments of their 
casings. PETN- and RDX-based formulations are commonly used in military blasting 
applications. Frequently encountered industrial blasting formulations may be based 
on ammonium nitrate and/or nitroglycerine. These include ANFO and dynamite 
(both described earlier) and blends based on mixtures of either nitroglycerine 
and nitrocellulose, or nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose and ammonium nitrate. 
Unsurprisingly, high explosives are also called detonating explosives.
 
Deflagrating explosives (formerly known also as low explosives) are those that will 
not normally detonate. Furthermore, in order to explode – rather than burn – they 
need to be confined or contained. Also, when they do explode, their action is better 
described as pushing rather than shattering. Nonetheless, as illustrated by the example 
shown in Figure 11.1, their action can be devastating. Examples of such explosives 
include the propellants used in firearms (Chapter 9) and explosive mixtures of air and 
fuel gases (e.g. natural gas or petrol vapour) or flammable dusts (e.g. flour or coal).
Deflagration
A type of chemical 
explosion in which 
the speed at which 
the reaction front 
moves through the 
explosive is less 
than the speed 
of sound in that 
material.
Detonation
A type of chemical 
explosion in which 
the speed at which 
the reaction front 
moves through the 
explosive is greater 
than the speed 
of sound in that 
material.

n Electrical heating, as occurs when an electric current passes through 
a resistor. All normal materials through which electricity passes offer 
some resistance1 and so will produce heat. The standard electrical wiring 
systems used to supply electricity to households, industry and commerce 
are no exception to this. However, they are designed such that, when 
they are installed and used correctly, the rate at which they produce heat 
is sufficiently low that it will be safely dissipated. There are nevertheless 
Spontaneous­combustion
There  are  a  number  of  fuels  that,  under  certain 
circumstances,  are  known  to  ignite  without  the 
application of an external source of energy. In other 
words,  they  undergo  spontaneous  combustion.  Such 
fires  start  when  exothermic  (i.e.  heat-releasing) 
chemical reactions occurring within the fuel produce 
heat at a more rapid rate than can be removed from the 
fuel by the processes of thermal conduction, convection 
and heat radiation (Box 10.3). These circumstances lead 
to an increase in the temperature of the fuel (i.e. the 
fuel is self-heating). This, in turn, causes the rate of 
the exothermic reaction to increase, thereby enhancing 
the heat release rate and speeding up the reaction still 
further (for many reactions, the temperature rise that 
is required to cause a doubling of rate is approximately 
10 °C). If this process continues unchecked, the ignition 
temperature of the fuel will eventually be reached and 
spontaneous combustion will ensue.
 
In  most  cases  of  spontaneous  combustion,  the 
exothermic reaction involved is the aerial oxidation of 
the fuel. As this takes place at the fuel–air interface, it 
is best facilitated if the surface area to volume ratio of 
the fuel is high, as in the case of finely divided solid 
fuels or liquid fuels soaked onto an absorbent matrix. 
Furthermore, in order to allow the temperature to build 
up, the fuel will, in most cases, have to be in a thermally 
insulated environment that, nonetheless, is permeable to 
the air. These observations are entirely in keeping with 
the properties of the common fuels that are known to 
be susceptible to spontaneous combustion. These include 
crumpled rags soaked in a drying oil (such as ‘boiled’ 
linseed  oil),  stacked  hay  or  other  similar  vegetable 
matter, and coal when stored in large stockpiles.
Pyrophoric­carbon
The prolonged heating of significant amounts of wood 
at temperatures in excess of 105 °C, but more typically 
120–200 °C,  under  conditions  in  which  ventilation 
is  severely  restricted  can  cause  the  production  of 
sufficient flammable char to lead to a fire if enough air 
is subsequently admitted. The char forms because of the 
slow pyrolysis of the wood. Weeks, months or years may 
be needed for sufficient char to build up to pose a fire 
hazard. The char itself is known as pyrophoric carbon or 
pyrophoric charcoal. The adjective pyrophoric means ’will 
spontaneously combust on exposure to air or oxygen‘. 
It is used in this context because once air is allowed 
to gain access to the char at the elevated temperatures 
that formed it, it will undergo a self-heating, exothermic 
reaction, thus allowing ignition to occur.

SIGNATURE INVESTIGATION  261
There are a number of handwriting characteristics 
associated with forged signatures that will alert the 
experienced document examiner to the fact that they 
may not be genuine. A selection of these is given 
below (usually, more than one of the following signs 
are present): 
 ‘Shaky’ handwriting (apparent when viewed under 
magnification). This occurs when the forger 
concentrates on copying the genuine signature very 
accurately by writing slowly (thus resulting in a loss 
of fluency).
 Unnatural pen lifts. This shows that the forger has 
paused to check progress.
 Pen strokes with blunt ends where the pen has been 
lifted from the paper. This indicates that the pen 
strokes of the writer have been made slowly and 
deliberately, while in fluent writing, such pen stroke 
ends tend to be tapered. Low-power microscopy is 
needed to view this particular feature.
 Evidence of retouching. This indicates that the forger 
has attempted to patch up ‘less good’ parts of the 
signature in an effort to make it more realistic.
 Difference in scale. The writing is noticeably smaller 
or bigger than the genuine writing.
 Incorrect proportioning of the letters.
 Unnatural similarity between two (or more) 
signatures. (Such close correspondence between 
signatures would not occur if the signatures were 
genuine because of the range of natural variation 
shown in an individual’s normal handwriting.)
In addition to the handwriting characteristics listed 
above, there may be other features that differ from the 
victim’s normal practice, for example the positioning 
of the signature relative to the rest of the document. 
Moreover, there may be physical evidence present 
that has its origins in the type of forgery method 
used. For example, the trace-over method produces 
an impression of the signature, which is subsequently 
inked in (Section 8.2.1). However, it may be possible 
to detect minute areas of indentation that the pen has 
missed, by examining the questioned signature under 
an oblique light source (figure (a)).

­226    FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
Harold  Frederick  Shipman  (born  14  January  1946) 
graduated from Leeds University Medical School in 1970 
and began work at Pontefract General Infirmary. In 1974, 
he left to join a group practice in Todmorden, Lancashire, 
UK, as a general practitioner. It was during this time that 
he began to suffer from blackouts. His colleagues at the 
practice discovered that he was addicted to pethidine 
(an opiate used as a painkiller) and had been falsifying 
prescriptions  in  order  to  obtain  it  for  his  own  use. 
Although he was fired by the practice and heavily fined, 
he was not struck off by the General Medical Council 
(GMC). In the last quarter of 1975, Harold Shipman was 
treated for his addiction to pethidine at The Retreat, 
York. In 1977, Shipman joined another group practice, 
this time in Hyde, a suburb of Manchester. Five years 
later, in 1992, he left to set up his own single-handed 
GP practice in Market Street, Hyde. His list of patients 
exceeded 3000, attesting to his popularity as a doctor 
and the high regard in which he was held.
 
However, there was growing concern, from a number 
of different quarters, about the high number of deaths 
among Shipman’s patients, compared with those of other 
local general practitioners in Hyde. These concerns were 
expressed to the Coroner in March 1998 by a local GP. 
Many of the deaths were of elderly women and many of 
these lived alone. It was the unexpected death of another 
of Shipman’s patients, Kathleen Grundy, a fit and active 
81-year-old widow, on 24 June 1998 that finally brought 
matters to a head. The emergence of a new will, sent on 
the day of Mrs Grundy’s death to a local firm of solicitors, 
aroused the suspicions of her daughter, who was herself 
a solicitor (and whose firm usually handled Mrs Grundy’s 
legal affairs). In this document, which was poorly typed 
and phrased, Kathleen Grundy bequeathed her entire 
estate (valued at nearly £400 000) to Shipman and not, as 
in her original will, to her family. Mrs Grundy’s daughter 
contacted the police about her suspicions that the newly 
amended version of her mother’s will was a forgery.
 
A decision was taken to exhume the body of Kathleen 
Grundy in order to perform a post-mortem examination. 
Toxicological tests revealed the presence of morphine, a 
metabolite of diamorphine formed almost instantly when 
diamorphine enters the bloodstream. As a consequence 
of this discovery, Shipman was arrested on 7 September 
1998 for the murder of Kathleen Grundy. In the wake  
of his arrest, other people came forward to say that  
they  too  were  concerned  about  the  circumstances  
surrounding  the  deaths  of  their  relatives,  who  were 
Shipman’s patients. Certain patterns began to emerge. 
The  deceased  individuals  were  frequently  described 
as being fit and active in life. Death had been sudden  
or  unexpected.  Furthermore,  Dr  Shipman  was  usually 
reported  to  be  present  on  the  day  of  death  (either 
attending  the  patient  before  or  even  at  the  time  of 
death) or discovering the body afterwards. The number 
of potential victims continued to grow and the evidence 
against Shipman began to mount, including the discovery 
at his practice of the typewriter used to produce the 
supposed last will of Mrs Kathleen Grundy.
 
On 5 October 1999, the trial of Harold Shipman for 
the murder of 15 elderly patients, including Kathleen 
Grundy, began at Preston Crown Court. On 31 January 
2000, Shipman was convicted of killing all 15 with lethal 
injections of diamorphine and of forging the will of Mrs 
Kathleen Grundy. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. 
In June 2001, a public inquiry, chaired by the High Court 
judge Dame Janet Smith, began into the circumstances 
surrounding the deaths of 493 of Shipman’s patients 
between 1974 and 1998. The first report of this inquiry, 
published on 19 July 2002, concluded that Shipman had 
murdered 215 of his patients (including the 15 for which 
he was convicted) and was strongly suspected of being 
responsible for the deaths of 45 more. A series of reports 
followed, culminating in the sixth report of the Shipman 
Inquiry  (published  on  27  January  2005),  in  which 
Dame Janet Smith focused mainly on Shipman’s time 
as a junior doctor at the Pontefract General Infirmary 
(1970–74). At the end of this final report, she gave the 
following overall conclusion: ‘that Shipman killed about 
250 patients between 1971 and 1998, of whom I have 
been able positively to identify 218’.
 
Meanwhile, on 13 January 2004, Dr Harold Shipman 
was found hanging in his cell at 6.20 a.m. and was 
pronounced dead after attempts to resuscitate him 
failed.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF HUMAN REMAINS n 401
n In cases of serious crime, the services of a forensic 
archaeologist may be requested by the police. He or 
she is able to offer advice and practical assistance in 
the location, excavation and recovery of buried human 
remains and, in the process, help maximise the recovery of 
forensic evidence.
n When the death of an individual is sudden, violent, 
unnatural, of unknown cause or suspicious in any way, 
forensic examination of the human remains can yield 
much valuable information concerning the death and the 
circumstances that surround it. In England and Wales, 
deaths that cannot be attributed to natural causes are 
reported to the coroner for further investigation. Sources 
of reported deaths include medical doctors, hospital 
authorities, the police and Registrars of Births and Deaths. 
n In each case of reported death, the coroner must 
decide whether it is necessary to order a post-mortem  
examination of the body (figures for the year 2009 show 
that this occurred in approximately 46 per cent of cases). 
Post-mortem examination for medico-legal purposes is 
usually carried out by a forensic pathologist. However, in 
cases where the human remains are in skeletal form, or are 
otherwise unrecognisable, forensic anthropologists and/or 
forensic odontologists may provide the necessary expertise. 
n The purpose of the post-mortem examination is to establish 
certain facts concerning the deceased and the circumstances 
surrounding his or her death. Notable among these are the 
time of death, the cause of death and the identification of 
the individual. In cases of suspicious deaths, such facts are 
critical to the police investigation.

3. ‘The toxicity of a substance is determined not only by its inherent toxic

5. Consider a case in which an individual has been arrested on suspicion of 
supplying drugs to users. At the time of the arrest, the person concerned was 
found to be in possession of 12 individual doses of what appeared to be heroin, 
each wrapped in brown paper. A subsequent search of the arrested person’s 
house revealed a roll of brown paper, from which some paper had apparently 
been torn, a quantity of off-white powder in a strong plastic bag and several

‘forensic’ referring to its application within a legal context. 
A poison may be defined as any substance that exerts a 
toxic effect when it encounters a biological system. In this 
chapter, the following broad groups of poisons are described: 
anions, corrosive poisons, gaseous and volatile poisons, 
metal and metalloid poisons, pesticides, toxins and drugs 
of abuse. Any exposure of an individual to potentially toxic 
substances may be accidental or the result of a deliberate 
act of, for example, attempted suicide or murder.
 In addition, many substances are deliberately self-
administered for the effects they induce. These are known 
collectively as drugs of abuse and are generally considered 
separately from other groups of poisons as a special case. 
The vast majority of these are subject to the Misuse of Drugs 
Act 1971 and therefore may also be referred to as controlled 
drugs. Such drugs may be produced illegally and/or diverted 
from licit sources. Examples include amphetamines, 
benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, heroin and lysergic acid 
diethylamide (LSD). However, some abused drugs, such as 
alcohol, are available legally. 
 The toxicity of a potentially poisonous sustance is 
determined by the dose that is administered, although 
other factors related to the recipient, such as weight, 
age, state of health and previous exposure, are also 
important. Poisons may be taken into the body via a 
number of different routes, namely ingestion, inhalation, 
skin contact, mucous membrane contact and injection. 
After absorption into the general blood circulation and 
subsequent distribution around the body, toxic substances 
are then eliminated from the body. Understanding the 
nature and dynamics of these processes is fundamental to 
the qualitative and quantitative analysis of blood or tissue 
samples taken from individuals for toxicological analysis.
 The analysis of a sample for drugs and other poisons may 
be qualitative and/or quantitative. The information obtained 
may help the courts to establish whether an offence has 
been committed, the nature of that offence and whether 
the accused is guilty. It can also provide intelligence 
information by linking different samples to the same source. 
The analytical procedures used will normally include the 
recording of readily made observations (e.g. shape, colour 
and dimensions) and will often employ presumptive tests, 
thin-layer chromatography (TLC), immunoassay and/or 
instrumental methods such as gas chromatography (GC) or 
atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).

A HEAD n xvii
As may be expected, since the publication of the second edition in 2008, there 
have been a number of developments in diverse aspects of forensic science. This 
new edition has been prepared with this in mind. In addition to general updating, 
new material of topical interest has been incorporated, while other areas have been 
enhanced to reflect current practice. 
 
The first significant change has been the incorporation of a brand-new section 
that deals specifically with the recovery of digital evidence from the crime scene 
(Section 2.5, Chapter 2), reflecting the increasing importance of this type of 
evidence in criminal investigations. This new section has been written by an 
expert in the field of digital forensics, namely Mr Daniel Brearley of Staffordshire 
University.
 
The second major improvement reflects the crucial role that the evaluation of 
evidence plays in the work of the forensic scientist. This new material is presented 
in two separate sections: the interpretation and evaluation of recoverable trace 
evidence (Section 3.7, Chapter 3) and the Case Assessment and Interpretation 
(CAI) model (Section 13.6.2, Chapter 13).
 
Thirdly, in response to comments from both students and reviewers, the boxed 
material on forensic archaeology, which concentrated on the search for human 
remains, has been extended to include the excavation and recovery of such remains 
and now comprises a section in its own right (Section 12.1, Chapter 12).

Preface 

 

 
In preparing the second edition of this book, we have extended the coverage 
given to aspects of the discipline of forensic science that students seem to find 
particularly challenging. Most notably, the consideration that was given in the first 
edition to the use of statistics in forensic science has been considerably enhanced. 
There is now a whole chapter (Chapter 13) dedicated to statistics and the analysis, 
interpretation and evaluation of evidence.
 
Another aspect that has been augmented in the second edition is the 
characterisation of man-made fibres using polarized-light microscopy, which is the 
subject of an extensive new box in Chapter 3 (Box 3.5). This material is supported 
by the inclusion of a range of colour plates – a new feature of the second edition. 
Additionally, the book now includes boxes on the role of the forensic archaeologist 
in finding human remains (Box 12.1) and a case study concerning the law on double 
jeopardy (Box 14.3).
 
Naturally, since the publication of the first edition in 2004, there have been 
developments in the field of forensic science, and the book has been updated 
throughout to reflect these. Perhaps the area in which scientific development has 
been most rapid is that of DNA evidence, and the chapter on this (Chapter 6) has 
been enhanced accordingly.

Preface to the second 
edition

 

 
Forensic science is the application of science in the resolution of legal disputes. 
Science is valuable in this context because it has the potential to provide reliable, 
pertinent and often definitive information about a given case. Furthermore, the 
information that it supplies frequently cannot be obtained by other means. Science 
can be used to identify individuals, objects and substances. Importantly, it can 
provide evidence of contact between an individual and the items or people that he 
or she has encountered. It may also reveal other types of information that could 
be pivotal in a given case, such as the amounts or concentrations of particular 
substances present in a given sample, or details about the timing or sequence of 
events that occurred during an incident.
 
The role of the forensic scientist is to provide the justice system with impartial, 
scientifically rigorous information. Such information can be crucial in establishing 
whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom. It can be used, for example, 
to test eyewitness accounts of the events that occurred during a particular incident, 
or to provide the investigating authorities with new leads or intelligence information.
 
This book was written to provide a clear and authoritative introduction to forensic 
science. It strives to describe and explain the principal features of forensic science 
as it is applied at all stages of the process, from the collection of physical evidence 
at the scene to the presentation of scientific findings in court. The book includes a 
guest chapter on the rapidly developing technique of DNA profiling, written by Dr 
Harry Mountain, a geneticist and lecturer in forensic genetics. Through this text, the 
reader is introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary necessary for an in-depth 
understanding of modern forensic science. However, although this book contains 
details of forensic methods, it does not contain specific information about risk and 
consequently it should not be used as an instruction manual. It should be noted that 
those parts of the book that are necessarily specific to a particular legal system are 
written from a UK perspective, with a particular emphasis on England and Wales. 
However, a conscious effort has been made to avoid allowing such jurisdiction-
specific information to permeate throughout the book. Consequently, most of the 
text is equally valuable to all readers, irrespective of the legal system operated by 
their country.
 
This text will primarily be of use to first-year undergraduates studying forensic 
science, either as a single subject or in combination with another discipline. However, 
it will also be of value to students of related disciplines, such as law, and those 
who undertake forensic science as a subsidiary or elective subject. Furthermore, 
Preface to the first 
edition

 
professionals, such as the police and lawyers, who routinely work with forensic 
scientists, may also find it useful as a reference book. The text is constructed 
in a concise and coherent manner, making extensive use of boxes to provide 
additional material on forensic techniques, further information and illustrative case 
studies. In order to enhance the reader’s learning experience further, both chapter 
objectives and end of chapter problems are provided. In addition, there is a glossary giving 
definitions of more commonly used specialised forensic science terms. The book is 
also supported by a dedicated website, which is available at http://www.pearsoned.

Many people have helped me in the writing of the chapter ‘The analysis of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): DNA profiling’. I would especially like to thank Julie 
and Andrew Jackson for inviting me to write the chapter in the first instance, for 
their very positive and encouraging approach throughout its writing and for inviting 
me to update it for the second and third editions.
 
I am very grateful for the critical and supportive reviews of the chapter from 
Kerry Brudenell, for the draft version, Sam Myers-Mills for the second edition and 
Dr William Goodwin for the third edition. Your suggestions and inputs are highly 
appreciated. I must also thank Carol Griffiths for directing me to Kerry. 
 
My gratitude also to the staff of the Forensic Science Department, in particular 
Laura Walton, and Biological Sciences who have been encouraging and forgiving of 
absences and missed deadlines during some of the writing.
 
Thank you to my daughters, Rebecka and Natasha, who provided many welcome 
distractions during the writing, more so in the earlier editions when they were 
younger, sadly less so as the years have passed, and for being understanding (in the 
main) of my frequent unavailability during the writing.

My thanks to Gail for her patience and support in the writing of this chapter and 
for her contributions to it in her reading of the numerous drafts and being critical 
with positive suggestions; my gratitude for these now seems so small when I think 
of her loveliness and everything, and more, that she brought to me for which I can 
never thank her enough.

In its broadest sense, forensic science may be defined as any science that is used in the 
service of the justice system. Such a wide definition necessarily encompasses both civil 
disputes and criminal cases. However, in practice, forensic science is more likely to be 
involved in the investigation and resolution of criminal cases and it is with this aspect 
that this text is almost exclusively concerned. 
This introductory chapter is designed to provide the reader with an insight into:
> the role played by forensic science in the investigation of crime (Section 1.1);
> the scientific investigation of forensic evidence (Section 1.2);
> the provision of forensic science services in England and Wales (Section 1.3);
> the accreditation of forensic science in the UK (Section 1.4);
> quality assurance issues within forensic science (Section 1.5).
Through the topics covered, the reader is introduced to the discipline of forensic science 
in general and to this book in particular. 
1.1 The role of forensic science 
  
 in the investigation of crime 
Forensic science plays a pivotal role in most criminal prosecutions, especially 
those of a more serious nature. Three distinct phases may be recognised within the 
procession from the collection of physical evidence to the presentation of scientific 
findings in court, each of which is described briefly in the following sections.
1.1.1  The recovery of evidence from the crime scene
The involvement of forensic science in the investigation and resolution of criminal 
offences begins at the crime scene. Thus, the effective recovery of items of physical 
evidence is crucial to the success of the subsequent inquiry. In recent years, this 
task has normally been carried out by highly trained civilian specialists, usually 
known as Scenes of Crime Officers (SOCOs) or Crime Scene Investigators (CSIs). 
Once recovered, items of physical evidence must be separately and appropriately

packaged, labelled, stored and transported to the laboratory for the next stage, that 
of forensic examination (Section 1.1.2).
 
It is vitally important that a ‘chain of custody’ is established for each individual 
item of evidence from the point of its recovery at the crime scene through to its 
possible appearance as a court exhibit (Figure 1.1). If continuity of evidence 
(i.e. a complete documented record of the progress of a particular evidential 
object) cannot be adequately demonstrated, then that evidence may be deemed 
inadmissible in court. This is because the possibility of the loss of its integrity due 
to contamination, or tampering, en route cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, its 
integrity may be compromised by deterioration in its condition post-collection and 
this might also render it inadmissible as evidence in court. Therefore, exhibits must 
be treated and stored appropriately according to their type at every stage.
 
The risk of contamination of evidence is minimised by applying the following 
precautionary steps:
n using chain of custody labels;
n opening each package in an area other than where it was originally sealed;
n repackaging each item of evidence as soon as it has been analysed;
n assiduously using logging systems;
n minimising the number of people handling the evidence;
n storing packaged evidence in a dedicated secure area.
In addition, in serious incidents the involvement of a dedicated exhibits officer will 
help to ensure continuity of the evidence.

Note that such items that are analysed in forensic laboratories are not often presented as 
exhibits in court. However, unless necessarily destroyed during analysis, any such item must 
be kept available in case it is needed in court. Where deemed appropriate, for any given item 
of evidence that has been recovered from a crime scene, one or more images of it may be 
presented in court instead of, or as well as, the item concerned

1.1.2   Laboratory work on evidence recovered from the 
crime scene
After recovery from the crime scene, evidential items of potential forensic 
importance are submitted to a laboratory for analysis (although not every scene 
item collected necessarily proceeds to this next stage). A range of organisations 
conduct such analyses. These organisations include the scientific support 
departments within the police service, the Forensic Science Service (FSS), LGC and 
small-scale forensic practitioners (see Section 1.3 for more details).
 
Forensic analysis of items of physical evidence may provide answers to a number 
of important questions. In the first place, it may be necessary to establish whether 
a crime has indeed been committed. Perhaps surprisingly, this is not always 
immediately obvious. For example, consider a case in which a man is arrested and 
found to have packets of pale brown powder in his pockets, which he claims to be 
sugar. The police, however, suspect illegal possession of the drug heroin. In this 
particular example, identification of the packaged substance is key to determining 
whether a criminal offence has, in fact, taken place.
 
Much of forensic science is concerned with establishing whether any links exist 
between the suspect, victim and/or crime scene. According to Locard’s exchange 
principle, ‘every contact leaves a trace’. This means, in theory at least, that any 
physical contact between individuals, or between an individual and a place or object, 
invariably results in the transference of traces of physical evidence. Examples of 
trace evidence that may be transferred in this manner include hairs, fibres, glass 
fragments, body fluids and gunshot residues. A comparison between similar items of 
trace evidence recovered from two different locations may establish whether there 
is a connection between the two. For example, it may help to place a suspect at the 
scene of a particular crime (although this does not necessarily mean that the said 
individual was involved in the commission of that crime). Evidence that links two 
separate entities, be they people or objects, can be termed associative evidence. 
 
In many cases, forensic science can provide information that either corroborates 
or refutes evidence from another source, such as supplied by eyewitnesses to 
a particular event. Furthermore, forensic evidence can facilitate intelligence 
gathering by the police. In the case of drugs, for example, the analysis of samples 
recovered from different locations may show that they have come from the same 
batch, or may help to pinpoint their country of origin (Chapter 7, Section 7.5.1). 
Forensic evidence may also reveal when an event occurred, or the order of a 
sequence of events. For example, it may be possible to determine the order in which 
two bullets struck a pane of glass (Chapter 3, Section 3.2).
 
Finally, the forensic analysis of particular types of evidence may help to establish 
the identity of an individual suspected of committing a crime. In cases where 
body fluids, such as blood or semen, are recovered from a crime scene, personal 
identification may be made through DNA profiling (Chapter 6). Similarly, a 
comparison of fingerprints left at a crime scene with those stored on IDENT1 (the 
national database for fingerprints, palm prints and crime scene marks) may be 
successful in identifying the individual responsible (Chapter 4, Section 4.1.3).

as glass shards,

may constitute 
important forensic 
evidence.

 
1.1.3   The interpretation and evaluation of scientific 
evidence and the presentation of scientific test 
results in court
Once an item of evidence has been analysed, the scientist will interpret the results 
to ascertain what can be established about the nature of that item. Furthermore, 
he or she will evaluate the data obtained to establish whether it supports the 
proposition put forward by the prosecution or that proposed by the defence. These 
are matters that are explored in Chapter 13.
 
The forensic scientist(s) responsible for the analysis, interpretation and 
evaluation of evidential items during a criminal investigation is required to write 
up his or her findings in the form of a report for use in court. As well as being 
comprehensive, the contents of such a report should be readily understood by non-
scientists within the Criminal Justice System. In most cases, the forensic scientist’s 
report is all that is seen by the court. However, on occasion, the forensic scientist is 
required to appear in court as an expert witness. In this capacity, he or she will give 
testimony of fact, and of opinion based on fact when required to do so, from within 
his or her own area of expertise (Chapter 14, Section 14.3).
1.2 The scientific investigation of 
  
 forensic evidence
After recovery from a crime scene, items of potential forensic importance are sent 
to the laboratory for scientific investigation. The purpose of this process is to obtain 
information relevant to the case in question from the articles submitted. The type 
of approach used for any given piece of evidence will be determined by the type of 
information sought. An important distinction is between qualitative analysis and 
quantitative analysis. The former is concerned with information that can provide 
evidence about the identity of an entity, while the latter aims to establish the 
amount or concentration of a given substance. For example, qualitative analysis 
may establish whether a given sample of blood contains alcohol, but quantitative 
analysis will be required to determine whether the sample has an alcohol content 
that is above the legal limit for drink-driving (Chapter 7, Section 7.2).
1.2.1  The comparison of evidence
In the majority of cases, the scientific investigation of evidence will involve  
comparison. This may be performed in a number of different ways, each of which is 
discussed briefly below.
Comparison between an evidential object and a relevant 
database
In some instances, the purpose of this type of comparison is to identify a category 
to which an item of evidence belongs. To achieve this, the class characteristics of 
the evidential item concerned are established. For example, if footwear impressions 
or prints are recovered from a crime scene, their sole patterns may be established and 
 4 n INTRODUCTION TO FORENSIC SCIENCE
Class characteristics
Characteristics that 
enable an object 
to be placed into a 
particular category, 
for example 
identifying a trainer 
as belonging to a 
certain brand.

 
then these may be usefully compared with sole patterns held on a footwear database 
(Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2). Through this exercise, it may be possible to identify the 
manufacturer and, conceivably, the style of the shoe concerned. This type of footwear 
comparison is particularly relevant to trainers. Similarly, tyre marks left at an incident 
scene may be compared with an appropriate database of tread pattern designs.
 
With some specific types of forensic evidence, namely fingerprints and samples 
of body fluids or tissues used for DNA profiling, the object of comparison with a 
database is the identification of the individual concerned. In the case of fingerprints, 
this may be achieved by searching IDENT1 (the national database for fingerprints, 
palm prints and crime scene marks) for possible matches (Chapter 4, Section 
4.1.3). With similar intent, DNA profiles may be compared with those held on the 
National DNA Database (NDNAD) (Chapter 6, Section 6.3.6).
Comparison between two pieces of evidence obtained from 
different places
This type of comparison seeks to determine whether two pieces of apparently similar 
forensic evidence, for example hairs, textile fibres, paint chips or glass fragments, 
may share a common origin. Its purpose, therefore, is to determine whether any 
possible link exists between the two separate locations from which the evidence has 
been retrieved (Section 1.1.2). This may be between two individuals (as in the case of 
the victim of an attack and his or her assailant), between an individual and a crime 
scene, or even between two different crime scenes. This type of comparison may be 
usefully illustrated by the following hypothetical scenario.
 
Consider a case in which a car window is broken and the CD player stolen from 
the vehicle. A suspect is apprehended by the police and, although the CD player 
is not in the suspect’s possession, there are splinters of glass adhered to the  
right-hand cuff of his jacket. A comparison is made between shards of glass taken 
from the car window and those recovered from the suspect. If these samples are 
found to be indistinguishable, this provides evidence that is consistent with the 
suspect being at the crime scene.
 
An exploration of how the strength of such evidence may be established is 
provided in Section 3.7 of Chapter 3.
Comparison between questioned samples, both positive and 
negative controls, and reference collections
A crime scene sample that is to be tested to find its evidential value is usually 
referred to as a questioned sample (or sometimes a disputed sample). Such tests 
are designed to evaluate a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a supposition that is either 
true or false and that can be tested by experimentation. For example, if a suspect 
is detained and found to possess a packet containing a pale brown powder, then 
the hypothesis may be that the powder is heroin. In order to test this hypothesis, 
experiments may be carried out that compare the chemical characteristics of this 
questioned sample with those of a known sample of heroin. Known samples such 
as this are referred to as positive controls, knowns or standards. If the questioned 
sample and the positive control are shown to have characteristics in common, it 
might be concluded that the questioned sample is indeed heroin. However, this may 
THE SCIENTIFIC INvESTIgaTION OF FORENSIC EvIDENCE n 5

 
 6 n INTRODUCTION TO FORENSIC SCIENCE
not be the case. It is possible that the chemicals and/or equipment used in the test 
were contaminated with heroin. In order to eliminate this possibility, it is necessary 
to carry out the test in a way that is identical in all respects to the tests to be 
carried out on the questioned sample and the positive control sample, except that 
it contains neither of these materials. Such a test is known as a negative control 
or a blank. In some instances, it is necessary to go to considerable lengths when 
carrying out the negative control test. For example, when testing for trace levels 
of explosives, swabs from all surfaces that will come into contact with the sample 
will be obtained. These will then be tested to show that the equipment was free 
from explosives. Note that in many applications, the term ‘control’ is used to denote 
either positive or negative controls; the context makes it clear which type of control 
is being referred to. There are circumstances in which it is valuable to compare a 
questioned sample with a number of positive controls. For example, the properties 
of a liquid retrieved from a scene of suspected arson may be compared with those 
of a range of flammable liquids, such as different types of petrol, paraffin and diesel 
fuel. Through comparison, it may be possible to identify the questioned sample via 
elimination and positive matching. A collection of positive controls used for such a 
purpose is known as a reference collection.
Comparison between a scene impression and a  
test impression
Impressions made by recognisable objects, such as footwear, tyres and tools, are 
often detected during the examination of crime scenes (Chapter 4). If an object 
suspected of creating the impression(s) in question is subsequently discovered, 
then that object may be used to create a series of test impressions. A comparison 
of these test impressions with the scene impression(s) may reveal that both types 
were created by objects with the same class characteristics. However, in some 
cases, it may be possible to proceed beyond this stage and identify the suspect 
item as being the actual one used in the commission of a crime. This can occur 
when individual characteristics, namely those that are peculiar to a particular 
individual object, are shown to be visible on the scene impression(s), as well as 
on the test impressions. Such individual characteristics may be created by some  
aberration during the manufacturing process but are more likely to be acquired 
as a result of general wear and tear. Characteristics that are exhibited in evidence 
and that are capable of identifying a specific item are said to be individualising.
1.2.2  Establishing what occurred during a crime: crime 
reconstruction and simulation experiments
The forensic evidence left at a crime scene may also be used to establish at least some 
of the events that occurred before, during and immediately after the commission of 
a crime and, possibly, the order in which they took place. The partial or complete 
reconstruction of a crime may be very important in corroborating (i.e. supporting) 
or refuting an account of events given, for example, by an individual suspected of 
involvement, or an eyewitness. In cases of violent crime, expert interpretation of 
bloodstain patterns left at the scene may provide vital information about what 
actually happened (Chapter 5, Box 5.4).

and, as such, are

In certain cases, simulation experiments may be performed to help ascertain 
what may have occurred during a given incident. This is best illustrated by an 
example. Consider a case in which a shotgun has been discharged during the 
commission of a crime. In such cases, it is valuable to know the distance from the 
muzzle of the gun to the target. As part of the investigation, a firearms examiner 
may conduct a simulation experiment in which the weapon concerned is test-fired 
at targets made of card, preferably using cartridges collected from either the crime 
scene or a suspect. During this experiment, the distance from the muzzle of the 
gun to the targets will be varied and recorded. This will enable a correlation to be 
established between the resultant damage patterns and the distance of firing. Thus, 
by comparison of the damage pattern at the scene with those produced during 
the simulation experiment, the distance over which the gun was fired during the 
commission of the crime can be established. This information may be important 
in corroborating or refuting a particular version of events given by an individual 
involved in the crime. Chapter 9 provides information on firearms-related evidence. 
1.2.3  Intelligence information
Forensic evidence collected from crime scenes is potentially useful in gathering 
intelligence information on criminals and their activities. For example, it may 
help to establish that a given individual was responsible for a number of apparently 
unconnected crimes. It may also provide investigative leads to the police, for 
example when traces of paint found on the victim of a hit-and-run incident reveal 
the colour of the car involved.
 
The amount of information generated through the recovery of forensic evidence 
from crime scenes, together with that from other policing activities, is enormous. 
In order to maximise effective use of this resource, West Midlands Police in 
conjunction with the Forensic Science Service (FSS) developed a computer software 
package known as FLINTS – the Forensic-Led Intelligence System, the first edition 
of which was made available in 1998.
 
FLINTS accesses a data warehouse, which holds many different types of 
information including crime reports, custody records, firearms registers, Automated 
Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), stop-and-search information, and forensic data 
such as fingerprints and DNA. Through the cross-reference and distillation of this 
stored information (which is automatically updated every few minutes), intelligence 
can be provided to the operator in response to the data/information that he or 
she inputs. FLINTS can be used to identify criminal networks, make connections 
between offenders and places, and establish patterns of crime (including, through 
geographical profiling, crime ‘hotspots’). Although FLINTS concentrates mainly on 
current offenders, it can also provide information that may be useful in predicting 
future crimes. This intelligence system (nicknamed ‘the digital detective’) has been 
adopted by other forces, such as Staffordshire Police.
 
The IMPACT Nominal Index (INI) is another computer-based system that 
facilitates the sharing of intelligence information between police forces. It allows 
those with authorisation to search for whether information on a given person is 
held by one or more of the organisations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern 
Ireland that contribute to the system. If such information is located via the INI, a 
follow-up request for that information must then be made by the organisation that 
instigated the search in order for it to be provided with that information.

At the time of writing (October 2010) the INI is scheduled to be replaced by the 
Police National Database (PND) that is currently being developed. The exact date 
when the INI will cease to function has yet to be decided but is expected to be in 
spring 2011. The PND will not only allow one police force to locate the whereabouts 
of information that is held by another force, but also enable this information to be 
shared between the forces concerned.
1.3 The provision of forensic science 
      services in England and Wales
Forensic science services in England and Wales are provided through scientific 
support within the police service, the Forensic Science Service (FSS) and 
other large-scale agencies and small-scale forensic practitioners. Details of the 
accreditation of laboratories and individuals concerned with the provision of 
forensic science services are given in Section 1.4. 
1.3.1  Scientific support within the police service
Within each police force, scientific support is typically organised into the following 
areas: the Scenes of Crime Department, the Fingerprint Bureau (or Department), 
the Photographic Services Department, the Chemical Enhancement Laboratory 
(CEL) and the Forensic Submissions Unit. The last of these is responsible for the 
management of the submission of items of potential evidential value to forensic 
science providers for analysis, interpretation and evaluation. Together these 
constitute the Scientific Support Unit (SSU), overseen by a Scientific Support 
Manager (SSM), or equivalent. The role of each of these scientific support services 
is discussed in detail in Chapter 2, Box 2.1.
1.3.2   The Forensic Science Service (FSS)  and other 
large-scale agencies
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is currently a major supplier of forensic science 
services in the UK. In 1991, it was established as an executive agency of the Home 
Office (formed from the regional government laboratories previously run by the 
Home Office Forensic Science Service). In 2005, the FSS changed its status from 
an agency to a company wholly owned by the UK government. The FSS has several 
regional laboratories including Huntingdon, London and Wetherby. It principally 
covers England and Wales. 
 
On 14 December 2010, James Brokenshire, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of 
State for the Home Department, announced that:
. . . FSS is currently making operating losses of around £2 million per month. 
Its cash is due to run out as early as January next year. It is vital that we take 
clear and decisive action to sort this out . . . We have therefore decided to sup-
port the wind-down of FSS, transferring or selling off as much of its operations 
as possible. We will work with FSS management and staff, ACPO (Association of 
 8 n INTRODUCTION TO FORENSIC SCIENCE

 
Chief Police Officers), and other suppliers to ensure an orderly transition, but 
our firm ambition is that there will be no continuing state interest in a foren-
sics provider by March 2012 . . .
Source: HMSO
 
Currently, the main customers of the FSS are the regional police forces in 
England and Wales, other police forces (e.g. British Transport Police and Ministry of 
Defence Police), the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Her Majesty’s Coroners and 
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). In addition, the services of the FSS 
are available to other customers, both at home and abroad. It is worth emphasising 
that, within the criminal justice system, the services of the FSS are available to the 
defence as well as to the prosecution. 
 
The vast majority of the work currently undertaken by the FSS concerns the 
analysis of samples of forensic importance (e.g. body fluids, DNA, fibres, glass, paint, 
shoe marks and tool marks) and compiling reports for use in court (Chapter 14, 
Section 14.2). In a small percentage of cases, FSS scientists are required to appear 
in court in person as expert witnesses. For example, during 2004–05, when the FSS 
dealt with around 130 000 cases, scientists gave expert testimony in court on nearly 
2500 occasions. They also attended approximately 1800 crime scenes during that 
same period.
 
There are a number of agencies other than the FSS itself that provide forensic 
services. For example, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), an 
agency of the UK Ministry of Defence (formed when the Defence Evaluation and 
Research Agency (DERA) split into two organisations in July 2001), provides analytical 
services for explosives, firearms and ballistics. Dstl also provides a forensic service for 
the identification of chemical and biological warfare agents. Another example is the 
now-privatised LGC (formerly called the Laboratory of the Government Chemist), 
which offers a number of forensic services including the analysis of controlled drugs, 
DNA, questioned documents and toxicological samples (both ante-mortem and post-
mortem), and the examination of mobile phones and computers. In September 2005, 
LGC acquired the UK’s largest private sector supplier of forensic science services, 
Forensic Alliance Ltd (FAL), originally established in 1997.
 
In Northern Ireland, forensic science services are provided by Forensic Science 
Northern Ireland (FSNI), while in Scotland there are four independent forensic 
laboratories – Strathclyde (based in Glasgow), Tayside (Dundee), Grampian 
(Aberdeen) and Lothian & Borders (Edinburgh) – which between them provide 
forensic science support to the eight Scottish police forces.
1.3.3  Small-scale forensic practitioners
In addition to the services provided by the FSS and other large-scale agencies, there 
are many other suppliers of forensic science services. These practitioners, working 
either alone or as part of, for example, a private practice, tend to be employed by 
the defence side in criminal prosecutions, although a number of such providers 
undertake work for the prosecution. Small-scale forensic practitioners tend to 
specialise in the type of forensic service that they supply, concentrating on one 
particular aspect, such as questioned document analysis. In common with other 
forensic scientists, such forensic practitioners may be called to appear in court to 
give expert witness testimony (Chapter 14, Section 14.3).

1.4 The accreditation of forensic 
  
 science in the UK 
1.4.1  Laboratory accreditation
Forensic science laboratories may seek accreditation from the United Kingdom 
Accreditation Service (UKAS). The function of this government-recognised 
national accreditation body is ‘to assess, against internationally agreed standards, 
organisations that provide certification, testing, inspection and calibration services’. 
UKAS accreditation demonstrates impartiality, competence and performance 
capability on the part of the organisation concerned.
 
The route to accreditation involves the following steps:
1. Application. First, a completed application form, prepared with reference to 
the appropriate accreditation standard, must be submitted. Following receipt, 
an assessment manager will be assigned to oversee the accreditation process 
of the applicant.
2. Pre-assessment visit. This stage is one which UKAS normally recommends. It 
is a visit carried out by the assessment manager. Its purpose is to verify that 
the company in question is ready to undergo the full accreditation process.
3. Initial assessment visit. A lead assessor (usually the assessment manager, 
see above), together with appropriate technical support, will undertake this 
visit, during which those areas for which accreditation is sought are assessed. 
If, during this process, the laboratory is found not to comply with any of 
the requirements set down by UKAS, then these must be rectified before  
accreditation can be awarded.
4. Maintenance and extension of accreditation. Once granted, accreditation is 
maintained by yearly surveillance visits. A full reassessment is carried out on 
a four-yearly basis. If wished, an accredited laboratory may extend the scope 
of its assessment, for example to additional analytical tests. 
Through the process described above, UKAS can provide accreditation to 
forensic laboratories in two main areas, testing and calibration, in both cases  
providing accreditation to ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 
17025, which deals with the general requirements for the competence of testing and 
calibration laboratories. LGC Ltd is an example of a forensic science provider that has 
laboratories that are UKAS accredited to ISO 17025 in these two areas. More details of 
the requirements for compliance with ISO 17025 are given in Section 1.5.
 
UKAS also provides accreditation for organisations that themselves provide 
inspection and certification services. Among the services provided by such 
organisations are certification to ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 (two of the most 
commonly implemented ISO standards, and recognised worldwide). The ISO 9000 
family of standards (including ISO 9001) concerns quality management, while 
that of ISO 14000 deals with environmental management issues. Either or both 
 10 n INTRODUCTION TO FORENSIC SCIENCE

 
of these standards may be sought by businesses in the forensic science sector. For 
example, Dstl (see Section 1.3.2) has ISO 9001 certification awarded by Lloyds 
Register Quality Assurance Ltd, which itself has accreditation (for the provision of 
certification services) from UKAS (ISO 17021). 
1.4.2  Individual accreditation
Those forensic science providers that have UKAS accreditation to the ISO 17025 
standard should be able to demonstrate that their personnel have the necessary 
knowledge, skills and ability to perform their duties in line with specified practices 
and procedures (see Section 1.5). However, not all forensic practitioners work in 
organisations that have this accreditation.
 
Prior to 31 March 2009, the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners 
(CRFP) acted as an independent regulatory body for individual forensic  
practitioners, whether or not they worked for an organisation that had ISO 17025. 
The CRFP had been established in October 2000 to set up and manage a register 
of competent forensic practitioners. Initially, it registered practitioners in crime 
scene examination, laboratory science and fingerprint examination. It grew to 
encompass new specialties, such as human contact traces, drugs and toxicology. By 
the time it ceased trading at the end of March 2009, it had more than 2500 forensic 
practitioners on its register.
 
Since the demise of the CRFP, the Forensic Science Society (FSSoc) has 
developed and is rolling out a model for the assessment of the competence 
of individual forensic practitioners. The model involves a two-stage process 
and successful applicants must pass both of them. The first of these stages, the 
pre-assessment, is based on a number of factors, including qualifications and 
experience. The second, the assessment stage, requires that applicants demonstrate 
an appropriate level of general and specialist knowledge, and practical skills. This 
model is not designed to replace the CRFP. Instead, it is intended to provide a 
means for the recognition of the competence of able forensic practitioners who are 
either sole traders or employed by organisations that do not have appropriate UKAS 
accreditation.
1.4.3  Course accreditation
Increasing interest in forensic science over the past decade has led to an expansion 
in the number of forensic science courses offered by UK universities, primarily at 
undergraduate level but also at postgraduate level. In response to this increase in 
provision, the Forensic Science Society (FSSoc) has introduced an accreditation 
system for forensic undergraduate and postgraduate courses. This system is based 
on three component standards, namely:
n interpretation, evaluation and presentation of evidence; 
n crime scene investigation;
n laboratory analysis.
THE aCCREDITaTION OF FORENSIC SCIENCE IN THE UK n 11

 
In order to achieve accreditation for a particular course, institutions have to achieve 
the requirements of the first component standard (interpretation, evaluation and 
presentation of evidence) plus at least those of one of the other two component 
standards listed above. 
 
Sector Skills Councils are organisations which aim to construct skills systems 
that meet the needs of employers across all of the UK. Skills for Justice is the 
Sector Skills Council for the Justice, Community Safety and Legal Services sectors. 
It operates Skillsmark®, which it describes as ‘the Quality Framework for Learning 
and Development in the Justice and Community Safety sector’. Higher education 
providers can apply for Skillsmark endorsement of their learning programmes. In 
order to achieve this endorsement for a given learning programme, such providers 
need to demonstrate that they are effective in the following areas:
n assessment of the needs of employers and the appropriate use of external 
benchmarks, including the National Occupational Standards (NOS), when 
constructing the learning programme (more information on NOS is supplied 
below);
n the design and development of the learning programme so that its learning 
outcomes and aims can be achieved;
n the delivery of the learning programme and the support that is given to those 
studying on the programme;
n keeping the learning programme up to date and responsive to the needs of 
employers and learners.
The NOS are nationally agreed documents that describe competent performance of 
employees in terms of outcomes. They are arranged into standards and the standards 
are gathered together to form suites. At the time of writing (October 2010), there 
are 44 standards in the Forensic Science Suite, the titles of which include:
n ‘Determine the forensic examinations to be undertaken’
n ‘Package, store and transport items of potential evidence’
n ‘Assess and compare forensic materials’
n ‘Assign meaningful conclusions to forensic findings’
1.5 Quality assurance in forensic science
From the collection of items of evidence at the crime scene and their subsequent 
analysis in the laboratory, through to the presentation of scientific findings in 
court, it is of paramount importance that the quality of the processes involved at 
each constituent stage can be satisfactorily demonstrated. Quality assurance may 
be defined as those systems that are put in place to guarantee that quality control is 
carried out, while quality control may be described as those day-to-day operational 
procedures enacted to ensure that the products or services concerned meet the 
required standards.
 12 n INTRODUCTION TO FORENSIC SCIENCE

 
 
There are a number of well-established means of quality assurance by which 
providers of forensic science services can ensure that they meet the exacting 
standards demanded of them. Police scientific support personnel (Chapter 2, Box 
2.1) and forensic scientists must be appropriately trained, qualified, experienced 
and supervised for the tasks that they are required to undertake. For example, in 
the UK, at the time of writing (October 2010) fingerprint expert status may only be 
achieved by undertaking the National Fingerprint Learning Programme provided by 
the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA). This programme, approved by

Students who successfully complete this programme are eligible for inclusion on 
the National Register of Fingerprint Experts. 
 
As well as being experts in their own fields, laboratory personnel (whatever their 
specialist area, e.g. questioned documents or glass analysis) and crime scene  
investigators need a number of qualities in order to be fully effective. They must be 
able to work in an ethically and legally acceptable fashion, be impartial and objective 
in their work and proceed methodically, while keeping an open and enquiring mind 
at all times. Moreover, they must be able to communicate effectively, not only with  
members of the team involved in the same case as themselves but also to a wider  
audience, in the form of written reports of their findings and, where required,  
testimony in court (Chapter 14, Sections 14.2 and 14.3 respectively). 
 
As outlined in Section 1.4.1, laboratories involved in forensic analysis and 
examination may apply for accreditation from UKAS. This can be achieved by  
demonstration of compliance with all of the relevant criteria set down in ISO 17025. 
The requirements of this international standard include:
n that laboratory personnel possess the necessary knowledge, skills and ability 
to carry out the tasks assigned, and that this competence is maintained by 
retraining, where necessary;
n secure storage conditions for evidential samples (both pre- and post-
examination) that are appropriate to the material concerned (i.e. to avoid 
any contamination, deterioration or loss of the evidence);
n full validation of all technical procedures before use in casework or in-house 
verification of procedures that have been previously validated in another  
laboratory; 
n the proper use, maintenance and calibration of the equipment used in the 
forensic laboratory and, when necessary, its replacement;
n the full documentation and proper control of reference collections (e.g. drug 
samples or cartridges); 
n the maintenance of a ‘chain of custody’ (Chapter 2, Section 2.4) to demonstrate 
that the integrity of evidential items has not been compromised;
n the use of appropriate quality control measures to assure the quality of test 
and calibration results; the measures available include alternative methods, 
independent checks, positive and negative controls, and repeat testing;
n the keeping of all necessary records of actions undertaken;
n the presentation of results in a form that is compliant with ISO 17025 
requirements.

There is now a wide variety of organisations that provide forensic science services 
to the Criminal Justice System (CJS) and the government has recognised that there 
is a need to ensure that all these providers work to appropriate standards of quality. 
To meet this need, the post of Forensic Science Regulator has been created. The 
person in this post is responsible for establishing and monitoring quality standards 
as they apply to these providers, and gives the government and the CJS independent 
advice on these quality standards. The Forensic Science Regulator is assisted by 
the Forensic Science Advisory Council (FSAC), which was established in November 
2007. The role of this council is to:
‘. . . advise and support the Regulator across a wide range of issues relevant 
to quality standards in forensic science. The FSAC will consider, and advise on 
many issues, including:
n setting, and monitoring compliance with quality standards in the provision 
of forensic science services 
n arrangements for the accreditation of those supplying forensic science 
services to the police, including in-house police services
n procedures for validating and approving new technologies and applications 
in the field of forensic science
n setting and monitoring compliance with standards relating to national 
forensic science databases, including the National DNA Database
n the quality of academic and educational courses in forensic science
n international developments relevant to forensic science quality standards
n assisting the Regulator in responding to requests for advice from Home 
Office Ministers and others.’2

Introduction
As introduced in Chapter 1 (Section 1.1.2), Locard’s exchange principle states that 
‘every contact leaves a trace’. From this it follows that the perpetrator of a crime 
will not only take traces of the crime scene away with him or her but also leave 
traces of his or her presence behind. For this reason, all forensic science starts at 
the crime scene. It is from here that items of physical and digital evidence that will 
be examined by forensic scientists are retrieved. The way in which scenes of crime 
are managed and recorded, and how the physical and digital evidence is located, 
collected, packaged, labelled and stored, are all fundamental to the success of 
subsequent forensic examinations. This chapter explores the principles, methods 
and procedures involved in the processing of crime scenes in general. More detailed 
information about the processing of fire scenes and explosion scenes is given in 
Chapters 10 and 11 respectively.
The crime scene
  2

 
2.1 An overview of crime scene
 
processing
The examination of any one crime scene seeks to answer a number of questions. It 
may provide pivotal information about:
 Who:
– was the victim of the crime?
– was the perpetrator of the crime?
– witnessed the crime?
 When:
– did the crime occur?
 Where: 
– did the key events that produced the crime scene take place? (For example, 
in the case of a body found in suspicious circumstances, there will be clues 
present that indicate whether the person died in situ or somewhere else.)
– and how did the people involved in the crime enter and, if applicable, leave 
the scene?
– were those people who were involved in the crime located at the time of its 
commission, and were they standing, sitting, kneeling, etc. at that time?
– did any inanimate objects that were involved in the incident originate from 
and where did they go to after the crime?
 What:
– was the sequence of events that occurred during the commission of the 
crime?
– was the motive?
– was the modus operandi (MO) of the criminal(s) involved?
– inanimate objects (tools, vehicles, weapons, etc.) were involved in the 
crime?
– was placed at the scene during the crime?
– was removed from the scene during the crime?
 Why:
– did the crime happen where it did?
– did the crime happen when it did?
In order to obtain such information, it is necessary to carry out a number of actions. 
Key among these are those listed below:
1. The preservation of the scene in the state in which it was found by restricting 
access to trained, authorised personnel only and, where necessary, protecting 
it from the elements (Section 2.2).
2. The recording of the scene, in the state in which it was found, by notes and, 
where appropriate, photographs, video recording, sketches and the collection 
of data that will allow virtual scenes to be made using computer graphics 
(Section 2.3).
3. The construction of a systematic log of all actions taken at the scene and by 
whom these actions were taken (Section 2.3.1).
Modus operandi 
(MO) of a criminal
The way in which 
the perpetrator of 
a crime carries out 
the act.
 16  the cRime scene

 
4. The systematic search for and recovery of physical evidence (Section 2.4).
5. The packaging and labelling of the physical evidence (Section 2.4).
6. The storage of the physical evidence (Section 2.4).
7. The subjection of the physical evidence to forensic examination (information 
on the methods used is given in Chapters 3 to 11).
Of these, actions 1 to 5 inclusive may be collectively referred to as crime scene 
processing. These occur at the scene, while actions 6 and 7 take place in specialised 
facilities housed either within police premises or in forensic laboratories.
 
Clearly, all crime scenes are different and the amount of time and effort that is 
expended in processing a given crime scene will depend on a number of factors. 
These include an assessment of the likely amount of useful evidence that can be 
retrieved from the scene, and the priorities of the government and the police 
force concerned. As would be expected, individual scenes of serious crime (such as 
murder or rape) receive more attention than do individual scenes of volume crime 
(such as car theft). Furthermore, within the area of volume crime, not all types of 
scene will necessarily be given the same priority. In England and Wales, each year, 
each police force will set its own targets that reflect the current policy set by Her 
Majesty’s Government. For example, in 2002, Staffordshire Police targeted certain 
aspects of volume crime, specifically burglary, drugs offences and car crime, leading 
to a higher priority being given to scenes of these crimes compared with other types 
of volume crime.
 
Irrespective of the type of crime scene under examination, optimum effectiveness 
will only be achieved if each of actions 1 to 7 (outlined above) is carried out with 
due care, diligence and expertise, and in an ethically and legally acceptable fashion. 
These factors are also of paramount significance during:
 the initial assessment of the scene (see Section 2.2);
 the management of any risks to the health or safety of both the people working 
on the case and the public;
 the interpretation of the scene in the light of the evidence gathered;
 the communication between all individuals involved in the case;
 the assessment of the intelligence value of the information obtained from the 
scene;
 the maintenance of the integrity of the physical evidence collected from the 
scene (crucially, this includes the avoidance of the possibility of contamination 
of this evidence);
 the preparation of reports and statements;
 the presentation of evidence in court, when required (Chapter 14).
The requirement for expertise across such a broad spectrum of activities means that 
a number of specific roles have now been identified and there are professionals who 
specialise in these roles. In the UK, these may be grouped under the headings of 
police officers, police scientific support professionals (Box 2.1), forensic scientists 
and other specialist personnel.

the police forces in england and Wales each employ 
expert scientific support personnel in each of the areas 
shown in the table below. each force also has a scientific 
support manager (ssm) or equivalent. in most forces, the 
ssm has overall responsibility for the management of all 
scientific support staff, which, as shown in the table, may 
be organised into four departments. those departments 
that fall under the responsibility of the ssm are usually 
referred to as the scientific support Unit (ssU). the 
vast majority of scientific support personnel who work 
for the police forces of england and Wales are, in fact, 
civilians. there is a national training centre in Durham, 
where nearly all of the police forces in england and Wales 
send their scientific support personnel for training. this 
provision is supplemented by the metropolitan Police, 
who have their own training school for their own staff 
but also offer places to the rest of the country.
 
in most UK police forces, and in this book, the staff 
who specialise in crime scene processing are denoted as 
scenes of crime Officers (sOcOs). however, this term is 
not universal. in the Kent constabulary, they are given 
the title crime scene investigators (csis) whereas in the 
Greater manchester Police they are called crime scene 
examiners. the expertise of sOcOs lies in the assessment, 
protection, recording, examination and interpretation of 
crime scenes, the collection, packaging, labelling and 
storage of physical evidence, and in the communication 
of their findings both orally and in the form of written 
reports and statements. sOcOs are frequently required to 
give evidence in court.
 
members of the Fingerprint Bureau identify people 
by comparing fingerprints. they also prepare written 
statements based on fingerprint evidence for use in 
court and, if necessary, attend court to present their 
findings. they work on the principle that no two people 
have fingerprints that match (chapter 4, section 4.1.1). 
therefore, if a match can be found between a good-
quality fingerprint taken from a crime scene and one 
obtained from a suspect, it is possible to say that the 
suspect had definitely left that mark and, by implication, 
that he or she had been at that scene. similarly, the 
Fingerprint Bureau can look for matches between either 
fingerprints found at a crime scene or those taken from 
a suspect and the fingerprints held on the national 
database. in the former case, a match will produce 
investigative leads that could result in the arrest of a 
suspect, while in the latter, a match will allow the 
identity of the suspect to be confirmed. Finally, it is 
worth noting that fingerprints can be used to identify 
deceased people (chapter 12, section 12.5.1).
 
While sOcOs are skilled in the use of routine 
photography to record crime scenes (section 2.3), they 
are not professional photographers. the Photographic 
services Department gives expert support in this area. 
this provision allows images to be taken, for example, 
under specialised illumination conditions such as those 
involving the use of ultraviolet or laser light sources 
(section 2.3.3). the Photographic services Department 
also provides darkroom staff and facilities, allowing 
the rapid and secure development of scenes of crime 
photographs. Digital photography is currently under 
development as an alternative to traditional, film-
based methods.
 
One of the most evidentially valuable activities that 
sOcOs undertake at crime scenes is the recovery of 
fingerprint evidence. in many cases, this is satisfactorily

In England and Wales, police officers are responsible for the initial response to 
an incident (Section 2.2), the detective work involved in the investigation of any 
crime and the overall management of crime scene processing. Under certain 
circumstances, they may also be responsible for the collection of physical evidence, 
although this task is usually undertaken by SOCOs (Box 2.1). In complex cases of 
serious crime, such as murder or rape, other personnel with specialist knowledge 
are called to the scene as necessary. These may include:
 police photographers (Box 2.1);
 forensic scientists (e.g. personnel from the Forensic Science Service (FSS) 
with expertise in bloodstain pattern analysis, see Chapter 5, Section 5.2);
 medical personnel (e.g. in the case of a suspicious death, a pathologist 
(Chapter 12, Section 12.4.3) or, in the case of a rape, a police surgeon 
(Chapter 5, Box 5.5));
 fire investigation specialists from the fire service (where arson is suspected, 
see Chapter 10, Box 10.4);
 a forensic archaeologist (to assist in the location, excavation and recovery of 
buried human remains, see Chapter 12, Section 12.1);
 a forensic entomologist (in the case of a partially decomposed body, see 
Chapter 12, Box 12.1);
 a forensic anthropologist (when skeletal remains are found, see Chapter 12, 
Section 12.5.2);
 bomb disposal experts;
 engineers (e.g. to assess the safety of a damaged building or other structure).
achieved by the application of fingerprint powder, 
followed by the photographic recording of the enhanced 
print and/or its lifting using a suitable adhesive-coated 
plastic film (chapter 4, section 4.1.5). this approach is 
often successful for the recovery of fingerprint evidence 
from smooth, non-porous surfaces but is not always the 
method of choice. the sOcO will frequently elect to send 
the entire object to the in-force chemical laboratory 
facility (usually called the ceL – see table 2.1 above). 
here, technicians can use a wide range of chemical 
enhancement techniques to visualise any latent (i.e. not 
visible) fingerprints present (chapter 4, section 4.1.5). 
Where appropriate, the ceL will also perform presumptive 
tests for blood (chapter 5, section 5.1.2) and, in certain 
circumstances (i.e. where the rules allow), may carry 
out presumptive tests for controlled drugs (chapter 7, 
section 7.5.3).
 
in addition to the roles of the ceL outlined in the 
previous paragraph, in-force laboratory facilities may 
also be used to: 
 recover marks made by footwear (chapter 4, section 
4.2);
 maintain and use a database of footwear marks;
 carry out basic tyre examinations (chapter 4, section 
4.5);
 restore erased serial numbers (chapter 9, Box 9.2);
 perform basic document examinations (limited to 
the simple evaluation of indented writing and basic 
scrutiny of forgeries and alterations, see chapter 8).
Finally, police scientific support also advises 
investigating officers about the potential value of 
forensic science in ongoing cases. it also provides 
a channel for the procurement of forensic science 
services, which in england and Wales, currently, are 
frequently obtained from the Forensic science service 
(Fss) (chapter 1, section 1.3.2).

The principles involved in the processing of a given crime scene do not alter with 
the seriousness of the crime concerned. However, there are important operational 
differences between the processing of the scenes of serious crime and those of volume 
crime. Actions by the law enforcement agencies that are reasonable at serious crime 
scenes are not necessarily so in the case of the scenes of volume crime. For example, 
consider the treatment of a bloody hand-print found on the wall of a house in which 
a murder by stabbing had been committed. In this case, after the print was properly 
recorded (Section 2.3), it would not be unknown for the portion of the wall on which 
it was found to be removed and then submitted for further examination in a forensic 
laboratory. Contrast this with the case of a tool mark found on a window frame, which 
is believed to have been made by a burglar while breaking and entering a domestic 
property. Typically, this would be photographically recorded, its impression would 
be made in silicone rubber and a small sample of paint from the frame would be 
taken. While there may be forensic benefit in doing so, it is highly unlikely that the 
whole window frame would be removed from the house for subsequent scrutiny in the 
laboratory. Certainly, any attempt to do this would normally prompt objections from 
the householder!
 
Other operational differences between the processing of serious and volume 
crime scenes originate from the finite resources that are available for this type 
of work. With these constraints in mind, the imperative given to the solution of 
a serious crime is generally greater than that warranted by any one incidence 
of volume crime. This difference in emphasis has led to the development of two 
different police management structures for the oversight of crime scene processing 
in England and Wales.
 
The management structure that is established for the investigation of each 
serious crime is summarised in Figure 2.1. Although the details of this structure 
vary slightly from one police force to the next, the main features remain essentially 
the same throughout England and Wales. Within this structure, responsibility for 
the management of the scientific support needed by the case concerned is given to 
the Crime Scene Co-ordinator, who is usually the force’s SSM or a senior SOCO. 
Working under his or her supervision are a number of Crime Scene Managers. These 
are needed because the majority of serious crimes will have more than one scene and a 
Crime Scene Manager is allocated to each of these to see that it is properly processed. 
For example, in a kidnap and murder case, the scenes are likely to include: 
 the body itself (all people, whether living or dead, who are associated with 
the crime may be considered to be crime scenes);
 the location in which the body was found;
 the place in which the murder took place (if different from where the body 
was found);
 the place in which the victim was held prisoner;
 the place where the kidnap occurred;
 any vehicles used by the kidnapper(s)/murderer(s);
 the suspects in the case;
 the home(s) and possibly the workplace(s) of the victim, and those of the 
suspects.

It is vitally important that the possibility of cross-contamination between material 
from different scenes is avoided. For example, consider a case in which a suspected 
murderer has been arrested. On questioning, he emphatically denied ever having 
met the deceased. Forensic examination of his clothing revealed a hair that was 
shown by DNA evidence (Chapter 6) to have belonged to the victim and several 
fibres that matched fibres taken from the deceased’s clothing. This would normally 
constitute strong associative physical evidence to link the suspect to the victim. 
Clearly, such physical evidence does not support his assertion that he had never met 
the victim. However, if, for example, it were shown in court that the same SOCO 
that had packaged the suspect’s garments had also attended the scene of the crime 
earlier in the same day, then the associative implications of the evidence would be 
severely diminished.

Note that the SSM will provide the SIO with advice about the scientific aspects of the 
investigation. The SSM together with the Crime Scene Co-ordinator have responsibility for 
scientific strategy and resourcing. The Crime Scene Manager has the tactical role, ensuring 
that the scene is properly examined and that evidence is recovered. The Crime Scene 
Manager is responsible for conduct at the scene: for example, a pathologist may be required 
to visit the scene but he or she will not be allowed to enter it until the Crime Scene Manager 
agrees, having first considered all the circumstances at the scene

Systems have been developed to minimise the opportunities for this type of 
occurrence. In England and Wales, it is part of the role of the SSM (Box 2.1) to 
ensure that, whenever possible, scientific support personnel do not each attend more 
than one of the scenes associated with a given crime. Furthermore, if, for example 
because of the finite number of personnel available, it proves necessary to send the 
same person to more than one such scene, the SSM must ensure that the person 
concerned goes through acceptable decontamination procedures between scenes. 
Finally, because of the pivotal importance of the avoidance of cross-contamination, 
the SSM must also ensure that a log is kept, for presentation in court if necessary, 
that shows which scientific support personnel attended each crime scene and when. 
It is common practice for the SSM to delegate responsibility for the tasks described 
in this paragraph to the Crime Scene Co-ordinator.
Crime Desk
The Crime Desk (or its equivalent) receives the report of the crime from the public. It assigns a police
officer to attend the scene (the First Officer Attending (FOA)). Later, an Investigating Officer (IO) will
also be appointed to oversee the case. Note that each police force is split into divisions based on the
geographical areas that the force serves. The allocation of a police officer to the role of IO is a divisional
responsibility. In many forces, this responsibility is delegated to the Crime Desk. In addition, depending
on the policies of the individual force, the Crime Desk may also make the decision about whether to send
a SOCO to the scene

In order to suit local policing needs, there is considerable variation in this structure from one 
force to the next and even between divisions in the same force
 22  the cRime scene

 
 
A typical management structure used in the processing of volume crime scenes 
in England and Wales is given in Figure 2.2. Usually, each such scene would be 
attended by a uniformed police officer, who would call for further assistance as 
required. A decision would be made as to whether the scene will be attended by 
a SOCO. This would be done in accordance with the policy of the individual force 
for which the officer worked. For example, in some forces, this decision is made by 
the first officer attending the scene, in others it is made by the staff of the Crime 
Desk. Some forces have a policy that all scenes of particular types of volume crime 
(especially domestic burglaries) are attended by a SOCO.
 
Further details of the roles of the First Officer Attending and the police scientific 
support professionals at scenes of both serious and volume crime are given in the 
following sections. 
2.2 The first police officer attending and 
  
 the preservation of the crime scene
The actions of the First Officer Attending (FOA) an incident scene are vitally 
important in maintaining the value of any physical evidence that may be present. 
This is equally true irrespective of the seriousness of the incident involved. While 
the effort that is exerted by the law enforcement agencies at the scene of a serious 
crime will be greater than at any one scene of volume crime, the principles that 
underlie the actions taken remain the same.
 
At an incident scene, the FOA has a duty to:
 carry out an initial assessment of the scene;
 deal with any emergencies (the overriding duty of the FOA is to preserve life, 
irrespective of whether crucial evidence is destroyed in the process);
 call for assistance as necessary;
 preserve the scene (unless it has been decided that physical evidence will not 
be recovered);
 make an appropriate record of his or her assessment and actions (included 
in this must be the times at which any key events took place, such as the 
FOA’s arrival at the scene, and any estimated time of the incident that may 
be available from, for example, eyewitnesses);
 communicate his or her assessment and actions to those who will take over 
the responsibility for the processing of the scene and/or those responsible 
for the investigation of the case;
 provide appropriate information about the processing of the case to those 
members of the public who are directly involved.
The FOA’s initial assessment will take into account any prior knowledge that he 
or she has about the incident that is believed to have occurred at the scene and is 
likely to start with an informal interview of the person who raised the alarm. This will 
enable the officer to obtain a first-hand, although not necessarily reliable, account

of the nature of the incident, and possibly the order of events and key timings. 
Given the often fragmentary, sometimes confusing and possibly misleading nature 
of the information that is obtained from a crime scene, it is vitally important that 
all law enforcement personnel, including the FOA, keep an open and enquiring mind 
throughout the processing of the scene. 
 
One of the early tasks during the initial assessment is an evaluation by the FOA 
of whether it is likely that a crime has taken place. In making this evaluation, it 
is usually appropriate that the officer assumes the worst. For example, there have 
been instances in which murder has been initially assessed as suicide by the FOA, 
thereby losing valuable time in the early stages of the investigation.
 
In cases where it appears likely that a crime has been committed, the FOA must, 
during his or her initial assessment, ascertain whether any of the following are 
present or nearby:
 Injured persons.
 Victims.
 Eyewitnesses (who should be kept separate from one another, by the FOA, to 
avoid both conversation between them that could distort their memories of 
the incident and the possibility of the transfer from one to another of trace 
evidence, such as hairs and other fibres).
 Suspects (who must be kept separate from each other, and from witnesses). 
It should be borne in mind that seemingly innocent witnesses might, in fact, 
be suspects in the case.
In many instances, in order to carry out his or her initial assessment, the FOA will have 
to enter the scene. This must be done with great caution. In particular, due regard 
has to be paid to the health and safety of both the officer concerned and anyone else 
present. The avoidance of any unnecessary damage to the physical evidence present at 
the scene is also of crucial importance. This evidence is most likely to be found at the 
location(s) within the scene at which the crime(s) took place and along any path taken 
through the scene by the perpetrator(s) and, possibly, the victim(s).
 
It is not unknown for some attempt to have been made to clean up the scene before 
the arrival of the FOA. This may have been done by the perpetrator in an attempt to 
destroy evidence or by the victim out of a desire to return the situation to normality. 
In either case, the FOA must bring such activity to a halt, if it is still ongoing when 
he or she arrives. The officer should try to ascertain what has occurred during the 
cleaning processes (including the fate of any discarded objects) and in what ways 
the scene has been altered by it. It is quite possible that valuable evidence has been 
thrown in a waste bin or poured down a drain. This evidence may be retrievable even 
in the latter case as it is sometimes possible to recover valuable material (e.g. illicit 
drugs) from ‘U-bend’ traps within the plumbing system. 
 
Many scenes contain a physical barrier through which anyone who had access to the 
location at which the crime took place must have passed. Typical examples include the 
outer walls, doors and windows of a property or the fence and gates of a field. Under 
these circumstances, the probability of finding physical evidence is particularly high at 
the points of entry and exit within this barrier that were used by the perpetrator(s). The 
FOA should therefore attempt to discover, from witnesses and direct observation, 
 24  the cRime scene

 
the most likely locations of these points and, if possible, avoid them when entering and 
exiting the scene. Note, in volume crime (burglary, car crime, etc.) the vast majority of 
evidence is recovered at the point of entry (POE).
 
While moving through the scene, the FOA should avoid the unnecessary 
disturbance of any part of it. He or she must take care not to leave his or her 
fingerprints at the scene. Also, any actions that might damage any pre-existing marks 
and impressions that might be present must be avoided if at all possible. As an aid 
to achieving this, the FOA should bear in mind the likely locations of evidentially 
valuable fingerprints – including door handles, light switches and any obviously 
disturbed items – and footprints. He or she should also note any details that might be 
evidentially valuable and that are likely to be transient in nature. These could include 
any discernible smell, the warmth of any cooked food or cooking equipment, and 
the locations and orientations of any objects that have to be moved by the FOA. An 
example of the last of these might well be a door that has to be opened to gain access 
to a room. Before doing this, the FOA should note whether the door was open or shut 
and, if shut, whether it was locked.
 
On completion of the initial assessment, the FOA must then deal with any 
emergencies. Most importantly, this will include the giving of first aid to anyone 
at the scene who needs it. If possible, it will also include the arrest of the likely 
perpetrator(s). When prioritising his or her actions, the FOA must remember 
that the saving of life takes precedence over both the arrest of a suspect and the 
preservation of physical evidence. It is, however, possible to give effective first aid 
while minimising the impact of this action on the value of any physical evidence 
present. To achieve this, the FOA should note such factors as:
 the original position and posture of the person being treated;
 the original direction of flow of any blood or other fluids present;
 the location, condition and spatial orientation of any objects – including 
clothing – that have to be moved in order to carry out the first aid;
 the presence of any objects in the hands (including fibres, such as hairs) or 
foreign material (e.g. skin) under the fingernails of the injured person.
If necessary, these notes may initially be made mentally. However, under these 
circumstances, they should be recorded in writing and sketches (as appropriate), as 
soon as the situation is under control.
 
After the initial assessment and while dealing with any emergencies, the FOA 
will call, usually by radio or mobile telephone, for any assistance needed. This may 
include the attendance of more police officers and, if there are any injured people 
present, ambulance(s) and paramedic staff.
 
Also, a decision must be made as to whether physical evidence will be collected 
from the scene. This will be made in line with the procedures, policy and priorities 
of the force concerned. The factors that will be taken into consideration during this 
decision will include the seriousness of the crime, the likelihood of the successful 
recovery of useful physical evidence and the disruption to the business of the public 
that evidence collection will cause.
 
If physical evidence is to be collected, this will, under some circumstances 
(particularly in the case of certain volume crimes), be carried out by the FOA or 
the FiRst POLice OFFiceR AttenDinG AnD the PReseRVAtiOn OF the cRime scene  25

 
another uniformed officer. However, in England and Wales, this task is normally 
undertaken by SOCOs (Box 2.1). Irrespective of who carries out the recovery of 
physical evidence, it will be done once the scene has been preserved (see below) and 
the principles and processes involved remain the same (Section 2.4).
 
In order to maximise the efficiency and efficacy of the collection of physical 
evidence, it is important that an appropriate level of communication is established 
between the FOA and the personnel who will collect the evidence. In England and 
Wales, in cases of volume crime, there is likely to be a time interval between the 
departure of the FOA from the scene and the arrival of the SOCO. Under these 
circumstances, this communication may occur via radio or mobile telephone either 
directly or through the central control room of the force concerned. In contrast, 
the FOA will normally still be at the scene of a serious crime when the SOCOs 
arrive. Under these circumstances, the SOCOs will debrief the FOA before taking 
over responsibility for the processing of the scene. It should be emphasised that, in 
any event, serious crime scenes are always guarded by the police from the moment 
of the arrival of the FOA until the scene has been fully processed.
 
If physical evidence is to be recovered, the FOA must take immediate steps 
to preserve the scene as soon as the initial assessment of the scene has been 
completed, any emergencies have been dealt with and – if necessary – assistance 
called. At this point, a decision needs to be made as to whether the entire scene 
will be preserved or if there is to be a selective preservation of those parts of it that 
are most likely to yield physical evidence. Which of these two options is chosen will 
depend on the individual circumstances of the incident, particularly the severity of 
the crime. In the UK (and in many other nations), the former option will be adopted 
for the vast majority of scenes of serious crime.
 
In order to preserve a crime scene, there are two principal potential agents of 
damage from which the physical evidence present must be protected, namely 
people’s inappropriate actions and the weather. In both cases, the approach used is 
to isolate the physical evidence from the potential cause of the damage.
 
At the scene of a volume crime, such as a domestic burglary, the exclusion of 
unauthorised people might be achieved by careful instructions to the householder 
concerning what may and what may not be touched before the arrival of the SOCO. 
However, in the vast majority of cases of serious crime and in some volume crimes, 
it is necessary to place a physical barrier (cordon) around the scene’s perimeter in 
order to restrict access to it. In some cases, a suitable barrier is already present, 
such as the fence and gates that surround a house that is the location of a crime. 
However, in many cases such barriers are either absent or do not fully encompass 
the scene. Under these circumstances, a barrier made of plastic tape that is overseen 
by a police officer is usually sufficient to ensure that only authorised people enter 
the scene. 
 
When considering where to place the cordon that will isolate the crime scene 
from its surroundings, it is important to remember that it is highly likely that 
the value of any physical evidence that is subsequently collected from outside the 
cordon will be low. This is because activities outside the cordon may physically 
degrade the evidence (e.g. a fingerprint may become smudged) or contaminate it 
(e.g. fibres from the investigator’s clothing may become mixed with those from the 
perpetrator(s) and/or victim(s)). Furthermore, it is quite possible to decrease the 
area encompassed by the cordon, once it has been established. With these factors in 
 26  the cRime scene

 
mind, it is clear that the cordon should encompass as wide an area as is practicable. 
Certainly, it should include the location(s) in the scene where the crime(s) took 
place and the points of entry to and exit from the scene of the people involved in 
the incident.
 
In cases of serious crime, it is crucial that the cordon around the perimeter of 
the scene is policed at all times from the moment it is established until the scene 
processing is complete. The officer in charge of this cordon must rigorously exclude 
all people, including senior members of the police, who do not have a pressing and 
legitimate operational need to enter the scene. This officer must also keep a log of 
the names of all who enter the scene, the times at which each individual enters and 
leaves the scene and ensure that whoever enters the scene is wearing appropriate 
protective clothing (Figure 2.3).
Figure 2.3 Full protective kit as worn during the collection of physical evidence

DNA) derived from the person who is collecting it. Note that this person is also wearing  
plastic overshoes of the type visible in Figure 2.4

In scenes that are either partially or wholly exposed to the elements, consideration 
needs to be given to whether aspects of the scene need to be protected from the 
weather. In making this decision, the following points will be taken into account:
 an assessment of the susceptibility of the evidence to damage from the weather;
 the prevailing weather conditions;
 any likely changes in the weather before collection of the evidence will be 
possible;
 the possibility of damage to, or contamination of, the evidence during any 
actions taken to protect it.
For some types of evidence, such as footwear marks or a small weapon, suitable 
protection may be afforded by placing a clean cardboard box over the evidence and/or 
redirecting any overland flow of water away from it. Large objects that are, nonetheless, 
easily moved may be placed in a sheltered area (e.g. a garden shed) to protect them 
from the weather. Before doing this, the position and orientation of the object should 
be recorded by notes, and sketches and/or photographs – as appropriate.
 
In the UK and in many other nations, in the case of serious crime, it is highly 
likely that further assistance will appear within a few minutes of the arrival at the 
scene of the FOA. The FOA must brief arriving law enforcement personnel as soon as 
practicable to convey his or her initial assessment of the scene and all of the actions 
that he or she has taken thus far. On arrival at the scene, the police scientific support 
personnel will assume responsibility for its preservation. They will do this under the 
supervision of a Crime Scene Manager, who will take charge of the scene as a whole. 
The scientific support personnel may use equipment such as stepping plates (Figure 
2.4) or tents to protect specific locations within the scene and will review the position 
and security of the cordon. Indeed, in relatively large scenes, two cordons, one within 
the other, may be established. For example, if a body is discovered in the bedroom of 
a detached house that stands within its own grounds, an inner cordon may be placed 
around the house while an outer cordon may be positioned to encompass the limits 
of the grounds. In such cases, the inner cordon is usually directly controlled by the 
Crime Scene Manager, while a police officer keeps a log of all those who cross the 
outer cordon. Furthermore, those who are allowed to cross the inner cordon may well 
be required to wear more protective clothing than those who cross only the outer one.
 
In scenes of serious crime that contain a clear focal point, such as a dead body, 
there is a need to gain access to this point early in the investigation. In order to 
achieve this without damaging physical evidence present at the scene, a common 
approach path (CAP) from the cordon to the focal point will be created (Box 2.2). 
This will not be done until the responsibility for the scene has passed from the FOA.
 
Whenever possible, advice should be given to any emergency medical personnel 
attending the scene on how to minimise the impact of their actions on the physical 
evidence present. However, this advice, and the manner in which it is imparted, must 
not interfere with the effectiveness of any medical treatment given. The person issuing 
this advice will be the police officer in charge (who will be the FOA, at least until 
assistance arrives) or another law enforcement professional (police officer or SOCO). 
The identity of the medical personnel attending and, if possible, the impact of their 
actions on the scene must be noted by a police officer, often the FOA.

in cases of serious crime (e.g. a murder), it is accepted 
practice in the UK to establish what is known as a 
common approach path (cAP). this runs from a point 
in the police cordon that surrounds the crime scene to 
the focal point of the scene (e.g. the body). this path 
is designed to allow early access to the focal point while 
minimising the impact on the scene as a whole. With 
this in mind, whenever possible, the course of the cAP is 
chosen such that it is unlikely to coincide with the path 
taken in or out of the scene by either the perpetrator(s) 
or the victim(s). During its establishment, the course of 
the cAP is carefully photographed. Long- and medium-
range shots are taken to record the scene’s overall 
appearance from the cAP. in addition, close-up images of 
the scene’s focal point are obtained from some distance 
away, using a telephoto lens, before there is any chance 
of its being disturbed by the approaching investigators.
 
During its creation, the course of the cAP is searched for 
items of physical evidence and its limits are marked with 
police plastic barrier tape. Any items of evidence that are 
located during this process are photographed in situ and 
then recovered in accordance with standard procedures.

In the UK, in the case of a violent incident, by the time the emergency medical 
personnel are ready to take any injured people to hospital it is highly unlikely that 
the FOA will be the only police officer at the scene. Under these circumstances, it 
is desirable that a police officer accompanies any injured person taken from the 
scene. In doing this, each officer concerned will be in a position to:
 listen to and note anything that is said by the injured person that might have 
a bearing on the case (such as the names of people involved in the incident) 
– declarations made by dying people are often taken as strong evidence in 
the belief that people are unlikely to lie in such situations;
 protect the victim from further attack, if necessary;
 detain the injured person if he or she is a suspect in the case;
 advise the medical personnel in the ambulance and at the hospital about how 
best to collect and package any physical evidence taken from the patient 
(Section 2.4) (such advice should only be acted on insofar as it is consistent 
with best medical practice);
 receive into custody any physical evidence taken from the injured person.
If, however, the ambulance is ready to leave before the FOA is joined by other police 
officers, then he or she will remain at the scene and allow the ambulance to leave 
without a police officer inside it.
 
Finally, it must be noted that the FOA needs to communicate effectively with 
members of the public present at the scene. Where appropriate, the officer should 
inform them about the steps that will be taken in the processing of the case and 
encourage their co-operation. Clearly, the FOA should neither divulge details to 
the public that might aid the perpetrator evade effective prosecution, nor give 
information to the press unless asked to do so by the officer in overall charge of 
the investigation.
2.3 Recording the crime scene 
Any crime scene from which physical evidence is to be recovered must be recorded, a 
process that is also known as ‘documenting the crime scene’. This is done by making 
written notes that are augmented by photographs, video recordings and/or sketches, 
as appropriate. Also in England and Wales, in the case of a serious crime, accurate 
dimensional information will be taken using surveying equipment that will allow the 
subsequent use of computers to generate a virtual reconstruction of the crime scene.
 
In some cases, the investigator (whether a SOCO or police officer) may initially 
produce an oral record of some or all of his or her notes using a portable audiotape 
machine and/or the soundtrack facility on a videotape recorder. If this is done, 
the oral record should be converted to written notes as soon as practicable. 
The products of all of the means used to record the scene (including any audio 
recordings used to assist note-making) must be stored in the case file for as long as 
required by the policies of the police force concerned.
 30  the cRime scene

 
 
There are a number of reasons for recording the crime scene, that is to:
 provide a permanent record of the crime scene in the state in which it 
was found for use during the investigation (e.g. to act as a reminder to 
investigating officers and/or witnesses) and in court, if the case culminates 
in a trial;
 produce an account of the steps taken during the processing of the crime scene;
 record fragile physical evidence before it is recovered in case it is destroyed 
during the recovery process.
While the principles involved remain the same, the level of detail with which a given 
crime scene will be recorded will reflect the severity of the crime and the nature of 
the scene. For any one crime scene, this level will be determined by the priorities 
and policies of, and resources available to, the police force concerned. In the UK, 
and in many other nations, scenes of serious crime (especially murder) are recorded 
in great detail. The salient features of each of the means by which this is achieved 
are described in Sections 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 below.
2.3.1 Note-taking at scenes of serious crime
To be fully effective, the notes taken at the scene must include the following:
 A record of who reported the incident, the time and date at which it was 
reported and exactly where the incident scene is located (importantly, 
in England and Wales, the FOA must record that he or she has made 
investigations to establish not only the veracity of these records but also that 
any account of what happened during the incident, as given by the person 
who reported it, is a true reflection of what actually occurred).
 An ongoing assessment, as far as is possible, of:
– the likely nature of the incident (e.g. murder);
– the events that took place during the incident (including their sequence 
and timings);
– the roles and locations of the people involved in these events; 
– any material change that may have occurred to the scene between the 
time of the incident and the arrival of the FOA and/or factors that might 
have caused such change to have occurred (e.g. heavy rain that might have 
washed evidence away).
 A log of the identities of all people who have been at the scene – including a 
record of the time and date at which each person entered and left the scene – 
from the moment of the arrival of the FOA (Section 2.2) to the time at which 
the processing of the scene is completed.
 Detailed descriptions of the actions undertaken at the scene by each of the 
people referred to in the previous bullet point, including the chronology of 
events incorporating all key times and dates.
 A record of each item of physical evidence recovered from the scene, detailing 
the identity of the person who recovered it, the time and date at which it was

recovered, the exact location from which it was taken and a description of the 
item involved.
 A log of all images taken of the scene (whether by still photography – 
conventional or digital – or video recording) describing for each image:
– the exact location of the camera operator;
– the identity of the camera operator;
– the direction in which the camera was pointed;
– the time and date at which the image was captured;
– any special lighting or other conditions used;
– the items and/or area of the scene from which the image was captured.
 A log of any sketches made of the scene.
 A detailed description of the surroundings of the crime scene.
 A record of the conditions of weather and light that prevailed during the 
processing of the scene.
 A thorough description of the crime scene itself in the condition in which 
it was found prior to the removal of any physical evidence, including details 
of any features that might be of evidential worth (such as the location and 
condition of any likely points of entry and/or exit used by the individuals 
involved in the incident).
Importantly, the notes made during the investigation of the scene should record 
the work undertaken and the order in which it was done. Such notes must be 
contemporaneous, that is they must be made at the time at which the activity being 
recorded took place. As mentioned previously, audiotapes may be used to record 
such notes at the scene, provided that these notes are then written up with the 
minimum of delay.
 
All notes must be sufficiently clear and detailed to be of value to someone reading 
them a long time after the scene was processed. In the UK, cases of unsolved serious 
crimes are periodically reviewed. Under these circumstances, the original notes may 
be reread many years after they were made. If these notes are unclear, ambiguous or 
even physically difficult to read they may be insufficient for the needs of any reopened 
investigation. Also, should a case result in a prosecution, the notes taken at the crime 
scene must be of sufficiently high quality to be presented in court, if required.
2.3.2  The sketching and virtual reconstruction of  
scenes of serious crimes
Until recently, sketches of serious crime scenes were frequently produced to show the 
locations and, as required, the dimensions and spatial orientations of salient objects 
and marks as they were found in situ (Figure 2.5). However, in England and Wales, 
such sketches have now been largely superseded by a combination of photographic 
images (both still and, where appropriate, video) and computer-generated virtual 
reconstruction of the crime scene. Such reconstructions are based on measurements 
taken at the crime scene using surveying techniques. Both sketches and virtual 
reconstructions have three significant advantages over photographs. These are that 
they provide a greater width and depth of field of view, they can eliminate distortion 
caused by perspective and they allow important features to be shown without the

distraction of unnecessary detail. One advantage that virtual reconstructions have over 
conventional sketches is that they can be used to take the observer on a virtual tour of 
the scene in question.
 
Sketching is not entirely redundant, however. Sketches are still made if an object 
has to be moved before it can be photographed and in cases where dimensions are 
crucial to the case but in which virtual reconstructions are not to be made. Sketches 
may also be used to show the direction in which photographs were taken. Also, 
pathologists still routinely make sketches that show where a body was found and the 
sites of injury on that body. Finally, sketches may be used to accompany items that 
are submitted for forensic examination in instances where dimensions and/or spatial 
orientations will help the forensic scientist interpret the evidence. For example, the 
FSS requests that glass samples taken from a broken window are submitted with an 
accompanying sketch giving the height and size of the window concerned.
2.3.3 Recording photographic still and video images of  
 
scenes of serious crimes
Photographic images are taken to produce a permanent record of the appearance of 
the scene in the state it was in prior to the removal of physical evidence. Ideally, this 
record should be made while the scene is in exactly the form it was in on the arrival 
of the first police officer to attend. However, at some scenes, there is a pressing need 
to take emergency action – such as the attention to the medical needs of someone 
found injured at the scene. Under these circumstances, some disturbance of the 
scene may have occurred before it can be photographically recorded. The nature of 
any such disruption (e.g. the movement of objects) should be noted and photographic 
images should then be taken without any further alterations being made to the scene. 
Certainly, objects that have been moved before they can be photographically recorded 
should not be moved back into their original positions prior to taking photographs.
 
Photographic images of the crime scene can be used to refresh the memory 
of crime scene investigators and, if appropriate, witnesses. They can also be used 
to corroborate or refute the statements of suspects and/or witnesses and they 
can be shown in court as an aid to the explanation of the nature of the incident. 
Unlike sketches, photographic images can, under certain circumstances, act as a 
substitute for items of physical evidence that either cannot be or have not been 
successfully recovered from the crime scene. In order to maximise the value of 
crime scene photography, it is important that the information recorded by it can be 
integrated with the other means by which the scene is documented. To this end, as 
noted in Section 2.3.1, a log should be kept of all images (whether still photographs 
or videotape) taken at the scene.
 
Crime scene photography is routinely carried out using conventional photographic 
techniques. However, specialised methods have also been developed to enhance 
features that might otherwise not be noticeable. For example, photography in subdued 
light of areas that have been sprayed with luminol reagent can reveal bloodstains that 
in their untreated state are invisible to the naked eye (Chapter 5, Section 5.1.2). Also, 
photographic images can be obtained using specialised illumination sources, such 
as those that provide ultraviolet or laser light. For example, the former may be used 
to enhance the appearance of injuries on human skin (Figure 2.6), while the latter 
can be of value in the recording of marks and impressions, such as fingerprints. In a 
 34  the cRime scene

 
similar vein, infrared photography can be used to visualise certain features, such as 
gunpowder marks on bloodstained garments and some types of ink. It should be noted 
that while specialised photographic techniques can be and are used at crime scenes, 
they are also employed in forensic laboratories, where lighting and other conditions 
may be more carefully controlled.
 
While the use of film-based still photography is well established, there is a recent 
trend towards the use of electronic means of image capture from the crime scene, 
whether in the form of digital photography or videotape. One of the advantages of 
digital still photography is that it allows rapid and effective image manipulation. 
This can, for example, enable overlapping photographs of a scene to be ‘stitched’ 
together to form a seamless panorama. Also, digital photography can facilitate 
image enhancement. For example, there are cases in which the clarity of an 
evidentially valuable mark, such as a fingerprint, is compromised by a repeating 
background pattern, such as the closely spaced security lines found on many 
banknotes, cheques, tickets, etc. Under such circumstances, it may be possible to 
digitally remove the underlying pattern from the overall image, thereby revealing 
the evidentially valuable mark (Figure 2.7). Note, however, that the ease with which 
digital images can be manipulated means that their credibility in court may be 
diminished compared with conventional photographs.

Videotape can be used to augment still photography in the recording of the 
overall appearance of a scene and the position of items of evidence within it. A 
narrative description may be added to the visual information at the crime scene by 
making use of the video camera’s sound recording facility. However, the potential 
for recording unwanted noises means that this facility is often left unused. At 
present, video recording cannot replace still photography (whether film-based or 
digital) because of video’s currently inferior resolution, and hence poorer ability to 
record details.
 
Wherever possible, crime scene photographic images should be free of any 
extraneous items, such as equipment brought to the scene by the investigators or 
indeed one or more of the investigators themselves. An important exception to this is 
the inclusion of a scale in the field of view of shots that are intended to record the size 
of a particular feature of the scene (this topic is returned to later on in this section). 
 
The still photography of the scene of a serious crime should be comprehensive. 
As described below, it should include photographs that show the environment of the 
scene, those that record the overall appearance of the scene and shots of individual 
items of physical evidence.
Environmental still photographs
Pictures that show the environment of the scene should be taken in all directions. 
For example, if the incident took place in a suburban setting, then photographs 
of the street or streets involved should be taken from several angles, as should 
photographs of nearby properties (including gardens) and any alleyways or 
footpaths. Similarly, photographs of the scene should be made from its surroundings, 
again in all directions. For example, if the scene is a building, photographs of each 
of its walls, doors and windows should be obtained. Aerial photographs may also be 
taken, as these are particularly good at showing the extent of the scene and the 
scene within its broader environment.
Still photographs that show the overall appearance of  
the scene
It is normal practice to create a common approach path (CAP) early in the 
investigation of a scene that contains a clear focal point, such as a dead body. As 
described in Box 2.2, a full photographic record is made of the CAP and its creation.
 
Once the focal point of the scene has been examined, attention can be given 
to the scene as a whole. During this process, photographs that record the overall 
appearance of the scene will be taken. In particular, the paths through the scene 
that are likely to have been taken by the perpetrator(s) and/or the victim(s) will 
be photographed. Also, there is an option to take a series of overlapping pictures 
from one or more points within the scene so that they can be overlain to reveal 
a panorama of the entirety of the scene that is visible from the point or points 
concerned. If the scene is indoors, then photographs of the interior surfaces (walls, 
ceiling, floor) of the scene’s constituent rooms will be taken, as necessary. Clearly, 
in doing this, particular attention will be paid to the room within which the focal 
point of the scene resides.

Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, each photograph that is intended 
to provide a record of an aspect of the scene’s overall appearance will be taken 
from eye height. Also, each such picture will normally be taken with a lens that 
minimises the distortion of the image (such as a standard 50 mm lens on a 35 mm 
camera). Furthermore, the scene will typically be photographed from a number of 
different angles, using both long- and medium-range shots. These measures will 
help to maximise the accuracy of the impression of the appearance of the crime 
scene in the eyes of those involved in the incident, those who witnessed it and 
those who investigated it.
Still photographs of items of evidence
Each item of physical evidence that is found at the scene of a serious crime should 
be photographed before it is recovered or otherwise moved. In many cases, more 
than one photograph of each such item will be required.
 
Long- and/or medium-range shots can be used to unambiguously record the 
location of the item concerned while it is in situ within the scene. Closer range 
photographs can be used to record its size. When taking such photographs, it is 
essential that a ruler or, better still, an L-shaped measure be added to the field of 
view near to the item of evidence (Figure 2.8). Also, to avoid distortions caused by 
perspective, it is important that the plane of the camera’s film and those of the 
scale and the resting place of the object are all parallel. Under these conditions, it is 
possible to faithfully reproduce photographs of the object of known scale (including 
1:1 images). Note, however, that it is not always absolutely necessary to include 
a scale in the field of view while photographing certain items in situ at the crime 
scene. This is only true of those items that can be easily recovered undamaged and 
that will not alter over time. If necessary, these objects may be photographed with 
scales at a later date or simply presented in court.

Photographs can also be used to preserve fragile pieces of evidence that might 
be damaged during their recovery. For example, consider a latent fingerprint 
that has been developed by dusting it with aluminium powder for subsequent 
recovery by lifting with adhesive tape (Chapter 4, Section 4.1.5). Photographing 
the fingerprint prior to lifting it provides a permanent image of the evidence that 
would be invaluable if the fingerprint were to become smudged during its recovery. 
Similarly, some or all of the evidential value of footprints and tyre marks in mud or 
snow can be recorded photographically prior to the recovery of the marks by casting 
techniques (Chapter 4, Sections 4.2 and 4.5 respectively).
 
When a dead body is present at a scene, it should be photographed from several 
different angles using medium-range shots. Close-up photographs should also be 
taken of any injuries evident on the body. Once the corpse has been removed, the 
surface on which it rested should be photographed, as this may also contain valuable 
evidence. Indeed, this last point is a general one; whenever a piece of evidence is 
recovered from a scene it is wise to inspect the place from which it was removed for 
any traces of evidential value. If found, these traces should be photographed before 
they too are recovered.
2.4 The recovery of physical evidence
Any object, mark or impression that can provide information about the incident 
under investigation is an item of physical evidence. This section is concerned with 
an overview of the general principles involved in the search for, and collection, 
packaging, labelling and storage of, such items. 
 
The underlying principles involved in the search for and handling of items of 
physical evidence is the same, irrespective of the crime being investigated. However, 
as with other aspects of crime scene processing, not all scenes that occur within a 
given police force’s area will receive the same amount of attention. In England and 
Wales, the main difference between the recovery of physical evidence from scenes 
of volume crime and those of serious crime is in the methods used to search for 
evidence and, to an extent, the types of evidence recovered.
 
Consider the scene of a typical volume crime, such as a domestic burglary, 
from which physical evidence is to be sought. In England and Wales, the SOCO 
in attendance (or, more rarely, a police officer) will normally dedicate the bulk of 
his or her search efforts to the discovery of high-quality evidence in areas of the 
scene that have clearly been disturbed by the perpetrator. Such areas are to be 
found along the route taken through the scene by the criminal. They are most likely 
to occur at any points of entry or exit from enclosed parts of the scene (such as 
buildings, rooms, vehicles and areas of land surrounded by fences) and at the focal 
point(s) of the crime (such as the room(s) from which items were stolen).
 
Currently, in the UK, the type of physical evidence most frequently sought at 
volume crime scenes, and one that is of high quality, is that of fingerprints. There 
are several reasons why fingerprints are particularly valued by the police, notably:
 the technology associated with the collection of fingerprints is well developed, 
reliable and, in most cases, easily applied;
 38  the cRime scene

 
 fingerprints may be compared with those previously collected from known 
individuals, thereby, in the case of a match, allowing the identification of the 
person involved;
 rapid results are possible as each police force in England and Wales, and 
Scotland has immediate access to IDENT1 – the national database for 
fingerprints, palm prints and crime scene marks (Chapter 4, Section 4.1.3);
 fingerprint evidence is readily accepted in court.
It is noteworthy, however, that recent rapid developments in Low Copy Number 
DNA techniques and the establishment of the National DNA Database (Chapter 
6, Section 6.3.6) may mean that the collection of biological material for DNA 
profiling from scenes of volume crime will become more routine in the near future. 
Importantly, as demonstrated by the case highlighted in Box 2.3, it is now often 
possible to obtain a DNA profile from the skin cells that are left behind when an 
object is touched by an individual. Other commonplace forms of evidence that 
are capable of forming strong evidential links with the perpetrator are footwear 
impressions (Chapter 4, Section 4.2) and tool marks (Chapter 4, Section 4.4).
in the late 1990s, staffordshire Police were part of a  
consortium of police forces drawn from the midlands 
area of the UK who were working together on what was 
named Operation Liberal. this campaign targeted crime 
perpetrated by people who stole from householders, 
having first gained their confidence by posing as 
official callers.
 
At this time, staffordshire Police were also carrying 
out a pilot study to test the usefulness of the then 
emerging Low copy number DnA technology. As 
explained in chapter 6, this technology is extremely 
sensitive. it is quite capable of producing a profile from 
the DnA left behind when an object, such as a door 
handle, is used by someone with bare hands. Although 
this high sensitivity is clearly an advantage, it can also 
cause problems. this is because the profile will contain 
information not only derived from the last person to 
handle the object but, at least potentially, from all other 
people who have touched it. therefore, it is best applied 
to objects that have been handled only by the suspect.
 
One of the cases being dealt with under Operation 
Liberal was that of an elderly lady who had had money 
stolen from her handbag while she was distracted by 
a man posing as a water company representative. this 
man called at the lady’s door, stating that there was a 
problem with the water supply and that he would have 
to turn her water off for a short while. the lady showed 
the bogus official where the property’s stopcock was 
and stayed with him while he turned it off. While the 
lady was so occupied, an accomplice of the bogus caller 
entered the property and stole cash from her handbag, 
which was in her bedroom. After a while, the self-
styled water company representative indicated that 
he had heard from a workmate that the problem with 
the water supply was now fixed and he duly turned the 
stopcock on again. it was not until the next day that 
the lady realised that her money had been stolen. she 
called the police, who ascertained from her that the 
bogus caller had handled the water main stopcock.
 
Under the pilot study, it was decided to swab 
for DnA from the stopcock. From its condition, it 
was apparent that it had not been turned for some 
time prior to the incident in question. it was felt, 
therefore, that any profile obtained would be likely 
to be practically free of contamination. this proved 
to be the case. the DnA from the stopcock was shown 
to match one of the records held on the national 
DnA Database. On this basis, a suspect was arrested 
who was subsequently tried, found guilty and given a 
substantial prison sentence.

While the types of physical evidence that are sought from scenes of volume crime 
are typically those that have the potential to individualise, types of evidence that 
can only reveal class characteristics (Chapter 1, Section 1.2) are also collected, 
particularly under circumstances in which they can corroborate other evidence. For 
example, consider the case of a man arrested shortly after he was seen breaking the 
side window of a car. The coat that he was wearing would be taken into custody and 
examined by a laboratory-based forensic scientist, as would a control sample of glass 
taken from that part of the broken window that was still held in the doorframe of 
the car concerned. Typically, glass fragments are not retained for long periods of 
time on garments that are being worn. In this case, the presence of fragments of 
toughened glass on the suspect’s coat that match those taken from the broken car 
window could be particularly incriminating as they corroborate the account of the 
incident given by the eyewitness.
 
As would be expected, the process of physical evidence discovery and collection 
at the scene of a serious crime is typically more painstaking than at any one scene 
of volume crime. In the case of an outdoor murder scene, physical evidence recovery 
starts with a search of the strip of ground that is to become the CAP between the 
perimeter of the scene and the body of the deceased (Box 2.2). Once this path is 
established, a tent will usually be used to protect the body from the elements. Access 
to the body is then at the discretion of the Crime Scene Manager who will admit 
specialists in order of priority after the body has been photographed and videotaped. 
For example, in the case of a part-buried, skeletalised body, experts may examine the 
burial site and/or the remains according to the following sequence:
1. A forensic botanist (who may be able to establish how long the body has 
been buried on the basis of the vegetation growth that has occurred on the 
disturbed ground).
2. A forensic archaeologist (Chapter 12, Section 12.1).
3. A forensic entomologist (if there are insects feeding on the body, see Chapter 
12, Box 12.1) or a forensic anthropologist if the remains are fully skeletalised 
(Chapter 12, Section 12.5.2).
4. A forensic pathologist (Chapter 12, Section 12.4.3).
Even if no other experts are called, a forensic pathologist will almost certainly 
attend the body of a murder victim, accompanied by a senior member of the police 
scientific support team (typically the Crime Scene Manager, who will be a senior 
SOCO or, in some cases, the SSM). Any item of physical evidence present on the 
body that might be readily dislodged and/or destroyed when the body is moved would 
then be removed and individually packaged. Typical items involved might be hairs 
held in a hand of the deceased. Where deemed appropriate, the entire body may be 
systematically covered in numbered strips of transparent plastic adhesive-coated 
tape. Items of recoverable trace evidence, such as fibres, will stick to the glue on 
the tape. Each of these strips – which are known as tape lifts – will then be removed 
along with adhering items of physical evidence. As with all types of trace evidence, 
the avoidance of contamination of these tape lifts is of paramount importance. 
This can be achieved if, as soon as each one has been removed from the body, it is 
adhered to a suitable surface (such as a piece of clear acetate film), sealed in place 
with further strips of adhesive tape and then sealed into a clean polythene bag.
 40  the cRime scene

 
 
The non-invasive part of the pathologist’s post-mortem examination to establish 
the cause of death will start at the crime scene. Once this has been finished, and 
the search for trace items of physical evidence on the body (usually including swabs 
for DNA profiling, see Chapter 6) and the necessary records have been completed, 
the body will be removed to the mortuary. To prepare the body for removal, plastic 
bags are secured over its head, hands and feet (to stop the loss of any items of trace 
physical evidence that might still be present) and it is placed inside a clean plastic, 
zip-up body bag. 
 
At the mortuary, items of physical evidence from the outside of the body (e.g. 
clothing and any items in pockets) that have not already been removed are collected 
and individually packaged. Where possible, samples of hair will be taken from the 
deceased, as these may be compared with any found in the possession of a suspect. 
During the invasive part of the post-mortem examination, samples of body fluids 
and tissues will be obtained. These can be used for pathological and toxicological 
assessments and as sources of control samples against which materials obtained 
from suspects can be compared. Throughout the processing of the body, it is treated 
as a crime scene in its own right, being documented with notes and sketches and 
photographic images as appropriate.
 
When the body has been removed from the scene of a murder, the search for 
evidence will continue in a systematic fashion. A number of different search patterns 
have been developed for this purpose, each of which is designed to ensure that the 
entire scene is thoroughly scrutinised (Figure 2.9). Indeed, it is common practice to 
search the scene of a serious crime at least twice, with the last search being made 
immediately before the processing of the scene is deemed to be complete.

Once items of physical evidence have been discovered, the priority given to the 
recovery of each item must be decided. In doing this, due regard has to be paid to 
the value and fragility of different items of evidence. If all other factors are equal, 
evidence that is both capable of individualisation (Chapter 1, Section 1.2) and 
easily damaged (such as fingerprints) will be given a high priority and therefore will 
be collected at the earliest practicable opportunity.
 
During the collection of physical evidence, it must always be borne in mind 
that the retrieval of one type of evidence may destroy another. For example, the 
application of silicone rubber casting material to an area in order to collect an 
impression of a tool mark is likely to destroy any fingerprints present at the same 
location. This loss may be avoided by dusting the area with fingerprint powder prior 
to the application of the casting material.
 
When physical evidence is collected from a scene, adequate control samples 
should also be collected. These are taken for two reasons. Firstly, controls are 
needed to enable evidentially valuable information to be distinguished from the 
background. For example, in a case in which a paramedic covered a fatally injured 
person with a blanket just before the victim died, this blanket would, if possible, be 
taken as a control sample. This would be done so that any fibres found on the body 
that matched those from the blanket could be eliminated and not confused with 
any that might be of evidential value. Secondly, controls are needed to facilitate 
comparisons between known control samples and questioned samples taken from 
elsewhere. For example, a sample of carpet taken from a crime scene could be used 
to provide control fibres for comparison with fibres found on the shoes of a suspect.
 
Irrespective of the seriousness of the crime being investigated, it is imperative that 
as soon as any one piece of evidence has been recovered from the scene it must be 
appropriately packaged, labelled and stored. In order to avoid the possibility of cross-
contamination between samples, all items must be packaged separately in previously 
unused containers. For similar reasons, and to avoid the loss of evidentially valuable 
material, the packages used for evidence should be completely sealed.
 
Different classes of material have different packaging requirements, for example:
 small items that may be easily lost (such as individual scalp hairs or chips 
of paint) may be wrapped in pre-folded paper (Figure 2.10) and held in fully 
sealed polythene bags (Figure 2.11);
 dry cloth items and shoes may be sealed in paper bags/sacks (Figure 2.11);
 wet cloth items may be sealed in polythene bags and frozen (Figure 2.11);
 digital items (see Section 2.5) may be sealed in antistatic bags (Figure 2.11);
 hypodermic syringes and knives may be packaged in tubes that are 
specifically designed for this purpose and then sealed in a suitable polythene 
evidence bag (Figure 2.11);
 items that are believed to be contaminated with liquid hydrocarbon-based 
fuels (such as petrol) are packaged in nylon bags, closed with airtight swan-
neck seals (Figure 2.12).
In many instances, it is wise to double-wrap items of physical evidence by placing 
the packaged item in a second, suitable, sealed container.
 
Each item of physical evidence must be labelled. As shown in Figure 2.13, the 
labels used convey identifying information about the item concerned and the case 
to which it relates. Each label also has spaces that are to be signed and dated by 
 42  the cRime scene

 
each person who has responsibility for the item, from the moment it is collected to 
the time at which it is destroyed. This produces what is known as a chain of custody. 
This is an uninterrupted series of identified individuals, each of whom can be asked 
to testify that the integrity of the item of evidence was not compromised while it 
was in his or her safe-keeping.

Items of physical evidence must be stored in secure facilities at all times. Also, 
the conditions under which such items are stored must be chosen with care, so as to 
minimise the rate of their deterioration. Different classes of item have different storage 
requirements. In the main, dry samples that are sealed in paper bags or cardboard 
boxes can be stored in cool, dry conditions, while wet samples kept in polythene bags 
need to be frozen to stop them mouldering. Biological samples usually need to be 
refrigerated or frozen and may require the addition of chemical preservatives.
 
Finally, it is important to note that there are usually a number of pressures that 
limit the amount of time that can be spent in the processing of a given crime scene. 
For example, deteriorating weather conditions may mean that physical evidence is 
likely to be destroyed unless it can be collected rapidly. Nonetheless, in order to 
be fully effective, the processes of physical evidence recovery must be carried out 
systematically, with an open and enquiring mind and a close attention to detail. As 
part of this, it should be borne in mind that not all scenes are as they first appear. 
For example, the use of specialist lighting techniques may reveal physical evidence 
that would otherwise remain hidden (e.g. in cases of sexual assault, semen stains 
may be more readily seen under ultraviolet light (in which they fluoresce) than under

ordinary daylight). Importantly, any mistakes or omissions made in the collection, 
labelling and storage of physical evidence may well not be rectifiable by subsequent 
work on the recovered items. If an item of physical evidence is overlooked during the 
processing of a scene, it is usually impossible to return to collect it at a later date. 
This is because, even if the item is still present at the scene, it would not be possible 
to be sure that it had not been altered, or indeed placed at the scene, at some point 
after the scene had been processed. Clearly, during the processing of a given crime 
scene it is better to err on the safe side when collecting items of physical evidence, 
taking more items and in larger amounts than the bare minimum.
2.5 The recovery of digital evidence
Guest section by Daniel Brearley
Digital devices are used to commit crime, contain evidence of crime and are often 
the targets of crime. In all such instances, Locard’s exchange principle (see Section 
1.1.2) is as valid for digital evidence stored or transmitted by a device as it is for 
physical evidence.
 
Digital forensics is an emerging science in the UK and, while academic and 
practitioner interest in it has grown rapidly in recent years, it remains that every 
crime scene, serious or otherwise, will not be blessed with the presence of a 
digital expert. It is therefore valid to anticipate that forensic science practitioners 
attending crime scenes will be required to make decisions or recommendations in 
relation to the presence of digital devices.
2.5.1  An introduction to digital devices and their 
potential relevance
It is expected that a typical crime scene in a residential or commercial setting 
will incorporate digital devices of various forms. While the list given below is not 
exhaustive and focuses squarely on the residential setting, it demonstrates that 
while many digital devices are obvious, some others are not:
 personal computers:
– tower type (where height > width);
– desktop type (where width > height);
– incorporated into a monitor (e.g. iMac from Apple);
– small cases (e.g. Mac Mini);
 laptops;
 mobile and ‘Smart’ phones, often incorporating subscriber identity modules 
(SIMs) and memory cards;
 personal digital assistants (PDAs) and electronic organisers;
 storage media:
– universal serial bus (USB) drives;
– external hard disks;
– compact disks (CDs);

functionality and

the RecOVeRY OF DiGitAL eViDence  47
– digital versatile disks (DVDs);
– memory cards (e.g. MicroSD, Compact Flash, MiniSD, etc.);
– SIM cards;
– wristwatches, pens, key rings, etc. with hidden USB capability;
 digital cameras;
 portable media players (e.g. iPod, MP3 music player, MP4 video player);
 satellite navigation (SatNav) units;
 Sky+ boxes and other hard disk recorders;
 games consoles;
 digital dictation machines;
 teddy bears, Barbie dolls, etc. with hidden USB capability and/or video 
playing capability.
In a crime scene, these devices may be in plain sight or hidden away and it is not 
uncommon for them to contain data, whether still visible to the typical user or 
recoverable from a deleted state, that is relevant to the alleged crime. 
 
Clearly, some crimes are committed with a digital device at their heart (e.g. 
banking fraud or cyber-stalking), but in many ‘traditional’ crimes, digital devices 
can hold a plethora of circumstantial evidence that can enhance an investigation. 
Consider the following examples:
 A mobile phone and accessories can be used to ascertain the owner’s 
associates and timed contact with them, hold timed photos which may be 
tagged with global positioning information, contain relevant text messages 
and emails or a complete web browsing history.
 A computer still storing user-deleted Google searches (see Box 2.4).
 A satellite navigation system containing data related to the start and end 
point of a journey, with points of interest along the route.
 Family home movies stored on a PC found in the home study of a recently 
deceased husband and father. In the desk drawer, edited versions of the same 
movies on a DVD but with footage of the husband removed, timestamped 
weeks earlier.
Justin Barber and April Barber were shot while walking on 
a deserted beach in Florida, UsA. April died from gunshot 
wounds to the face and Justin was left with wounds to 
the base of the neck, left hand, shoulder and chest. 
 
At the time of the incident, they were temporarily 
living apart for genuine reasons and April’s house had 
been recently broken into. Witnesses to the shooting 
told police that in addition to Barber’s vehicle, there 
was a second car parked at the beach around the time 
of the incident.
 
April’s family had suspicions that Justin was 
responsible, citing affairs and financial difficulties, and

2.5.2  Overview of a digital forensics investigation
Unsurprisingly, the phases of a digital forensics investigation are identical to 
those detailed in Chapter 1, Section 1.1. The focus herein is primarily upon the 
first of those broad phases, namely the recovery of evidence from the crime scene 
(Chapter 1, Section 1.1.1). Notwithstanding, Section 2.5.5 will introduce a method 
of controlled examination of digital evidence recovered from a crime scene.
 
By its nature – as with many fingerprints, DNA and other evidence typically 
categorised as forensic science – digital evidence is latent. It can be damaged, 
altered or destroyed with improper handling. Special equipment and software are 
required to extract and analyse the evidence from its resident device. Furthermore, 
this relies upon the device having been identified, documented and preserved at the 
crime scene in accord with certain requirements and precautions. Failure to do so 
can render the evidence contaminated and unusable or may alter the conclusions 
drawn from it. Ultimately, should evidence from any digital exhibit be relied upon in 
court, it will be vital for continuity and integrity of the exhibit to be demonstrated 
(Chapter 1, Section 1.1.1).
the police decided to search Justin’s computer. What 
they found was a number of Google searches made by 
Justin a few months before the shooting, including 
‘Florida & divorce’ and ‘trauma, cases, gunshot, right 
chest’. in addition, a Guns n’ Roses track named  
‘Used to Love her’ was downloaded around the same 
time and deleted after his wife’s death. it includes the 
lyrics ‘i used to love her, but i had to kill her. i had to 
put her six feet under and i can still hear her complain.’
 
Justin Barber was convicted of first-degree murder 
and sentenced to life in prison. he later made an 
unsuccessful appeal against his life sentence, citing 
that the evidence was purely circumstantial.
Box 2.7 continued
‘Principle 1:
no action taken by law enforcement agencies or their 
agents should change data held on a computer or storage 
media which may subsequently be relied upon in court.
Principle 2:
in circumstances where a person finds it necessary to 
access original data held on a computer or on storage 
media, that person must be competent to do so and be 
able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the 
implications of their actions.
Principle 3:
An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to 
computer-based electronic evidence should be created 
and preserved. An independent third party should be able 
to examine those processes and achieve the same result.
Principle 4:
the person in charge of the investigation (the case

the AcPO principles for digital evidence

 
the RecOVeRY OF DiGitAL eViDence  49
 
The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has issued guidelines in relation 
to digital evidence (Box 2.5) which apply throughout the phases of an investigation.
 
What the principles that are detailed in Box 2.5 essentially ensure is that:
 at the crime scene:
– no interaction with a powered device occurs beyond what is necessary and 
is undertaken by, or under the guidance of, a digital forensics expert, or is 
commensurate with an approved policy;
– all interaction with the original evidence is fully documented;
– continuity and integrity of the evidence is maintained, accompanied by 
full documentation;
 during examination:
– a forensically sound duplicate of the entire contents of the device’s storage 
media (e.g. hard disk, memory card, DVD, etc.) is made where possible, 
without any alteration being made to the evidence and examination is 
undertaken upon this duplicate;
– only a digital forensics expert (or, in some circumstances, a first responder 
trained in the use of an approved solution known not to alter the original 
evidence – see Section 2.5.5) should access the original evidence;
– all interaction with the original evidence is fully documented;
– continuity and integrity of the evidence is maintained, accompanied by 
full documentation;
 during the presentation of findings;
– whether or not an expert opinion is required, all facts and findings are 
proved to be authentic given the integrity of the earlier phases.
2.5.3 The crime scene in relation to digital evidence
The overriding guidance offered in Sections 2.1 to 2.4 inclusive all applies to 
responders at crime scenes containing digital evidence. The principles of processing 
and recording of the scene, responsibilities of the FOA and the recovery of physical 
evidence remain the same. This section, while offering fully contextualised guidance, 
provides a discussion specific to digital evidence only. For suggested undertakings 
that duplicate those previously discussed in Sections 2.1 to 2.4 inclusive, bullet 
points only will be presented in this section.
 
This section, in doing so, aims only to provide guidance in relation to generic 
situations that will be encountered, which will form the majority of incidents. It is 
accepted that, from time to time, there will be more appropriate options available. 
Anything that departs from the generic requires courses of action to be undertaken 
by a digital forensics specialist.
General
It is common for users of electronic devices to secure and/or encrypt them with 
passwords. While a specialist is well trained to deal with such circumstances, it can 
often lead to an examination requiring considerably more time and resources to be 
allocated to it. Also common is for users to write down their passwords or store them on 

 
 50  the cRime scene
other devices, for fear of forgetting them. Clearly, the examination will be well assisted 
if those processing the scene are able to recover possible passwords from it. Therefore, 
it is important to recover any diaries, notebooks, sticky notes, pieces of paper or other 
devices found in the proximity of the device being seized, in desk drawers and especially 
if they are stuck to the monitor or taped to the underside of the keyboard.
 
In any event, the device’s owner and/or user can be asked if passwords are 
required to use the device and any of its resident applications. Any information 
offered by the owner and/or user can be taken into account and noted, but with a 
healthy dose of caution.
 
If uncommon devices are seized, a user manual is best sought. If a device has a 
physical lock on it (e.g. a computer case) location of the key is preferable.
 
Detailed contemporaneous notes should be made of all undertakings,  
including the time and the person that carried out the undertaking. This applies 
even if photographic and/or video evidence is taken of any actions – it is not unheard 
of for photographs or video recordings to become unviewable at a later date. 
 
All large items seized (e.g. computers, laptops, games consoles) should have 
exhibit labels (as shown in Figure 2.13) attached or, if possible, be placed into a 
large-sized secure antistatic exhibit bag (Figure 2.11). All smaller items (e.g. USB 
drive, SatNav, mobile phones) should be placed into appropriately sized secure  
antistatic exhibit bags. These provide much improved protection for digital data 
than the tough brown-paper variety of exhibit bag.
 
It is the Investigating Officer’s responsibility (or the individual leading the civil 
investigation) to ensure that those seizing digital devices are appropriately trained 
to do so.
 
Similarly, the Investigating Officer should give consideration to whether  
fingerprints, DNA or other physical trace evidence should be collected from digital 
exhibits prior to transportation to a digital forensics laboratory or an examination on 
site. Such undertakings may risk the digital device becoming inoperable. For example, 
aluminium fingerprint powder is highly conductive and therefore especially harmful.
 
The decisions of the Investigating Officer are further complicated if a digital 
device forms a part of a network – see Box 2.6.
Wired or wireless networks linking multiple digital 
devices and external networks are now commonplace in 
UK households and, often with considerable complexity, 
in corporate environments.
 
such a configuration in a residential setting presents 
complications: for example, data relevant to the  
investigation may be stored on any connected device 
– inside or outside of the local environment – or at  
storage locations on the internet. Devices, including 
smart phones and the like, may also be transferring data 
without any human interaction or an unknown third 
party may be remotely connected to any of the devices 
without the knowledge of the sOcO, both potentially 
altering evidential data.
 
While expert attendance or, as a minimum, expert 
advice is preferable, the following steps are suggested 
Box 2.6

PCs and laptops
it is common for powered-on computers and laptops to 
activate screensavers when they have not been used for 
a period of time. screensavers can give the impression 
that the computer is powered off. it is preferable to 
check for any flashing lights before assuming that the 
computer is powered off. typically on the front of a 
computer or around the edges of a laptop, look for the 
‘hard drive activity’ light. Otherwise, look for lights on 
the monitor or where the network cable is attached, 
typically on the back of a computer tower or on the 
side or back of a laptop. Do not move the mouse, 
touch the keyboard or change the position of a laptop 
lid while doing so.
 
if in any doubt, press the down arrow on the 
keyboard once only to discover if the machine is 
powered or not, contemporaneously noting the time 
and the action.
 
Guidance on how devices should be treated when in 
either the powered-on or powered-off state is provided 
in the main body of the text.
 
if you consider that the device may be in ‘sleep’ mode 
– often established by a regular and slow flashing of the 
power light – it is recommended that you seek specialist 
advice as your actions may lead to avoidable data loss.
 
specialist advice is always best for a powered-on 
computer.
 
even for a digital forensics specialist, a powered-on 
computer presents several key decisions and 
challenges, which are often heightened depending on 
the nature of the incident and/or environment. 
 
in the same way that the collection of some types 
of physical evidence may impact on alternative types 
of evidence in the vicinity, there is a distinct ‘order of 
volatility’ to digital evidence and its collection. 
 
At its simplest level, the data contained within the 
running memory of a powered-on device is considerably 
more at risk of contamination (by modification or 
loss) than the data stored to the hard drive, but is 
completely lost as potential evidence when the device 
is powered down.
Box 2.7

to minimise adverse impacts on the investigation in 
the majority of residential cases where advice is not 
available:
1. Locate the router.*
2. if the lights upon it are either static or flashing 
occasionally, it is likely that no network traffic is 
occurring. Pull the telephone cable from the rear of 
the router but leave the router powered on.
3. if the lights are flashing fast, it is likely that 
considerable network activity is occurring. establish 
from the owner if he or she is aware of any current 
activity and record this in contemporaneous 
notes. Pull the telephone cable from the rear of 
the router but leave the router powered on. if the 
lights continue to flash in the same manner, it is 
indicative that devices within the local environment 
are continuing to transfer traffic. in such 
circumstances, pull the power plug from the rear of 
the router.
*  An electronic device that interconnects digital devices and networks 
allowing communication between them. in a residential setting, it 
is typically provided by the internet service Provider and takes the 
form of a wired or wireless device plugged into the telephone socket.

 52  the cRime scene
Powered off If the device is in a powered-off state (Box 2.7) the following actions 
should be taken at the scene:
 Secure the area, ensuring everyone is away from equipment and power 
supplies.
 Record the scene (Section 2.3).
 Do not power on the device.
 
   The action of powering on the device will immediately and considerably 
begin altering potential evidence stored thereon.
 Disconnect the power lead from the device, rather than from the wall socket.
 
   This is a preferred method for being sure that the device can no longer 
acquire power or to eliminate remote access to the device should it, in fact, 
be in ‘sleep’ mode.
 
 If the device is a laptop, remove the battery immediately after the power lead 
has been disconnected.
 
 Collect any physical forensic evidence (e.g. dust and hairs in the computer’s 
cooling fan unit).
 
 Take a photograph of all ports that have cables attached to the device before 
disconnecting each.
 
somewhat in contradiction, however, the longer 
a device remains powered on, the more evidence 
contamination will occur to the contents of its running 
memory and, in certain circumstances, some areas of 
the hard disk also.
 
in addition, any wired or wireless connection 
from the device to a network permits remote access 
to the device, opening up the possibility of evidence 
contamination, as discussed in Box 2.6.
 
Finally, the type of operating system running on the 
computer determines the best method for powering it 
down, such that potential evidence is best preserved.
 
Powering down a live computer can have negative 
impacts including (i) all ‘live’ data in its running memory 
and not written to the disk is lost; (ii) if any content is 
encrypted, examination of the same at a later date will 
only be achievable with the password; and (iii) if in a 
corporate environment, there may be a claim against the 
seizing authority for any lost or damaged data.
 
there are some tools available for use by non-
digital forensic experts to preserve the contents of a 
computer’s running memory prior to shutdown and it 
is expected that deployment of the same will become 
more common within UK law enforcement. these tools 
are typically configured in advance of an incident by 
an expert but must only be deployed by those trained 
by their agencies to do so. the decision whether to 
collect running memory contents is the responsibility 
of the investigating Officer, with advice from a digital 
forensics expert as to the likelihood that case-relevant 
evidence may reside therein.
 
Given the challenges presented by a powered-on 
device, if access to specialist advice is readily 
available, it must be sought. Only proceed with the 
process outlined in the powered-on section if specialist 
advice is not available.
Box 2.7 continued

 
the RecOVeRY OF DiGitAL eViDence  53
 
   This is necessary as the device may need to be set up during an examination 
in an identical manner to that in which it was when seized.
 
 Place the device into an antistatic exhibit bag in preparation for 
transportation to a digital forensics laboratory (see Section 2.5.4).
In the majority of cases, only the computer unit or laptop should be seized. Unless a 
digital forensics specialist guides otherwise, the monitor, cables, keyboard, mouse, 
etc. are not required by the digital examiner. Keep in mind that the Investigating 
Officer may require physical evidence to be acquired from the same. The power 
supply for a laptop should be seized.
Powered on If the device is in a powered-on state (Box 2.7), the following actions 
should be undertaken at the scene:
 Secure the area, ensuring everyone is away from equipment and power 
supplies and allow printing in progress to complete.
 Record the scene.
It is preferable that a second responder undertakes this while the first immediately 
focuses on the device. By virtue of a computer’s nature, potential evidence 
contained within it is altering with each passing moment that it is powered on 
and the operating system continues to run, even without any human intervention 
whatsoever. Clearly, this needs to be balanced with the fragility and propensity of 
degradation of other physical evidence requiring collection and the degree to which 
each item of evidence may enhance a subsequent investigation.
 Photograph and/or video what is displayed on the screen.
Should a screen saver be obviously present, a single press of the ‘down arrow’ key (as 
previously discussed in Box 2.7) should be undertaken. If this restores the screen, it 
should be photographed. If it displays that the computer is locked, specialist advice 
should be sought.
 
A blank screen may be restored as above or may simply need the monitor 
powering on.
 Without interacting with the computer further, disconnect the power supply 
as discussed in the powered-off section and complete the remainder of the 
actions detailed therein.
As noted in Box 2.7, the type of operating system installed on the computer 
determines the best method for powering it down. Given that this content focuses 
primarily on a residential setting, it is assumed that the operating system is a non-
server version of WindowsTM or an AppleTM Mac-type and therefore removing the 
power lead from the device is the recommended shutdown method. If it is known 
that the operating system is Windows Server, Linux or Unix, it is recommended to 
shut down the device normally.

 
 54  the cRime scene
Mobile phones
By their very nature, mobile phones are connected to their home network whenever 
they are in a powered-on state with the correct SIM card inserted and therefore 
evidential data are liable to modification. As examples, depending on the handset’s 
configuration: 
 a newly received text message can overwrite the space on a SIM card occupied 
by a previously deleted message;
 an incoming call may wipe records of a previous call, if there is a finite space 
for recording the same in the handset;
 the recorded last location will be updated;
 general automated operating system undertakings serve to continually alter 
resident data.
Therefore, typically it is best practice to power-down the handset as soon as 
is practicable after seizure. Before doing so, however, it is recommended that 
information relating to handset or SIM card access codes – personal identification 
number (PIN) – be sought from the owner and/or user. A proficient examiner 
is likely to be able to circumvent such user security on most handsets, but it is 
expected that an examination will be prolonged if a first responder fails to request 
this information or if it transpires to be inaccurate.
 
There are occasions when the handset is best left powered on and the advice of 
the Investigating Officer (or the individual leading the civil investigation) should be 
sought in relation to these situations:
 if the SIM card is from a non-UK network provider and it is confirmed or 
suspected that a SIM lock may be utilized;
 if life is at risk or similar such that a delay in examination is unacceptable;
 if maintenance of time and date in the handset is vital and examination is to 
occur within a short time.
In such circumstances, it is best practice to place the handset into a Faraday 
(signal shielding) bag or box to prevent further connection to the network. Seizure 
of the charger should occur. This is so that the device’s charge can be topped up 
while it is inside the bag or box as battery life will diminish greatly as the handset 
increases its power demand in attempts to reconnect to the network. Similarly, for 
smart phones, this combination of undertakings will preserve the contents of the 
handset’s volatile memory.
 
The seizing individual should record the status of the handset, including what 
was on the screen, in his or her contemporaneous notes and photograph the same if 
practicable.
 
As part of the seizing procedure, the Investigating Officer will obviously consider 
whether the preservation of any physical evidence, such as fingerprints or DNA, is 
required and will decide when this should occur within the overall process, likely 
based upon the latency of the same.

the RecOVeRY OF DiGitAL eViDence  55
 
Ancillary items such as telephone bills, manuals, purchase-related paperwork, 
handwritten PIN numbers, etc. may be a useful source of evidence to enhance the 
investigation.
 
Cables and/or docking stations may suggest that the handset has been 
synchronised with a computer and consideration should be given to locating and 
seizing the computer also. The scene may also be searched for memory cards and 
additional SIM cards that may have once been inserted into the device. Additional 
handsets may be relevant, regardless of whether they appear to be recently used or 
have SIM cards – a matter that the Investigating Officer can again decide upon.
Other devices
PDAs PDAs are becoming obsolete with the rise in smart phone technology but 
may still be located at crime scenes. If they are found in a powered-on state, they 
should be powered off and seizure of the charging cable should be made. PDAs do 
not have an internal hard disk, rather data are stored to flash memory, which may 
be irrevocably lost should the internal batteries fail. It is important therefore that a 
charge is periodically applied to the device prior to examination.
All other digital devices and digital storage media The remaining devices 
listed in Section 2.5.1 should all be seized as is, in an unpowered state (i.e. they 
should be switched off normally if found to be powered on), accompanied by all 
power and other cables.
 
Any loose storage media should also be seized and individually placed into 
separate secure antistatic exhibit bags if it is considered that data relevant to the 
investigation may be resident thereon.
2.5.4 Transportation
In general terms, any digital device should be kept away from magnetic fields during 
transportation. Typical sources of such fields in motor vehicles are heated seats, 
electric windows, stereo speakers and police radios.
 
Devices should be protected against physical jolts during transportation and 
therefore should be secured in the vehicle, whether this is within the boot, via a 
seatbelt or in passenger footwells.
 
As described in earlier sections, all devices and storage media are best placed 
into antistatic exhibit bags of the type shown in Figure 2.11.
 
Any digital device should not be exposed to excessive heat, cold, humidity or 
dampness.
 
In addition, computer cases and laptops should be transported in their proper 
upright orientation.

Although this section has focused solely on first responders seizing digital devices 
correctly to ensure continuity and integrity of potential evidence, there is a move 
within UK law enforcement currently towards the triaging of devices either at the 
crime scene or prior to formal transfer of the same to a unit responsible for digital 
examinations. This strategy is primarily born from the backlogs created by the 
submission of any and all devices for expert examination, with little or no appreciation 
of whether evidence of value actually resides upon a device. There are also obvious 
advantages in terms of early decision-making relating to continued custody or initial 
questioning of a suspect. Parties who support the use of triage also argue that it serves 
to make best use of available resources and helps victims of crimes to have justice 
more expediently.
 
In some police authorities, it has become commonplace for first responders to 
be trained in the use of specific triage tools which can read and display data from a 
device – such as a computer’s hard drive, a memory card or a mobile phone handset 
– in a forensically sound manner, in accordance with pre-programmed ‘examination 
profiles’ or profiles manually pre-configured by a digital forensics expert. Examples 
of situations in which this may be done are described in Box 2.8.
It is valid to suggest that SOCOs are appropriate personnel to receive digital device 
triage training should a law enforcement authority incorporate the same into their 
operational procedures. 
 
It should, of course, go without saying that triage must not be attempted if training 
to the standard required by the commissioning agency has not been completed. 
triage solutions are currently available from several 
providers and are used by trained first responders in 
agreed scenarios, including the following examples:
  the examination of multiple computer hard drives 
located at the residence of a suspected distributor 
of material related to child indecency. every hard 
drive is triaged using a profile that results in any 
image (photo, picture, etc.) and a static snapshot 
of each video to be displayed by the triage tool. the 
decision to formally submit to a digital forensics 
unit is based upon whether one or more potentially 
indecent artefacts are located.
  A suspect is detained for possession of drugs with 
intent to supply. early decisions are aided by  
triaging his or her mobile phone handset and sim 
card for incoming and outgoing text messages.
  A mobile telephone handset is triaged at the scene 
of a fatal road traffic accident using a profile aimed 
at simply reviewing call and text message records to 
suggest whether the handset may have been in use 
at the time of the incident. A formal referral of the 
exhibit to a digital forensics unit can establish for 
certain the accuracy of any timestamps when triage 
has suggested that relevant data may exist.

Problems
1. The duties of the First Officer Attending (FOA) at a crime scene have been 
summarised as ‘to assess, protect and communicate’. Do you agree that this 
is an accurate synopsis? Justify your answer.
2. Early one summer’s morning, a man who is walking his dog along a public 
footpath bordered by fields discovers a dead body. The weather is fine, 
warm and sunny, but there has been recent rain and further heavy rain is 
forecast. A very rough plan sketch of the scene is shown in Figure 2.14. A 
brief inspection reveals that the victim is quite clearly dead, and appears 
to have suffered multiple stab-wounds. The man makes a 999 call using 
his mobile phone to request police attendance. The first police officer to 
attend the scene is logged in at the police control room as the First Officer 
Attending (FOA). Shortly after the arrival at the scene of the FOA, further 
police officers, together with scientific support personnel, arrive and take 
over responsibility for the scene. How may the scene be preserved, recorded 
and searched? Once items of physical evidence have been recovered, what 
steps should be taken to avoid cross-contamination between them?
3. Consider a case in which the body of a stabbing victim was found smeared in 
her own blood. The investigator noticed that there was also an approximately 
circular bloodstain with scalloped edges on the body that, because of its 
characteristic shape, appeared to have fallen onto the body from above. What 
samples do you believe need be taken, from the scene and/or elsewhere, 
in order to use DNA profiling to test the hypothesis that the circular stain 
 the crime scene is often the source of information that is 
crucial to the solution of the case concerned. importantly, 
recovered items of physical and digital evidence may help 
to establish key aspects of the case, including whether a 
crime has been committed and, if so, the type of crime 
concerned, how it was carried out, when it was committed 
and the identity of the perpetrator(s) and victim(s).
 Key to the effective processing of a crime scene are 
the actions of the police officers involved (notably the 
First Officer Attending (FOA)) and the police scientific 
support professionals (in particular, the scenes of crime 
Officer (sOcO)). Principal actions undertaken during the  
processing of a crime scene are the preservation of the 
scene, the recording of the scene, the logging of all 
actions taken at the scene and the systematic search for 
and recovery of items of physical and digital evidence. 
these items, which may be subjected to laboratory-based 
forensic examination, must be properly packaged, labelled 
and stored.
 the principles involved in the processing of any crime 
scene remain the same irrespective of the seriousness of 
the case. however, it is important to realise that, within 
this framework, the exact sequence of events involved in 
crime scene processing will vary considerably from one 
incident to the next, reflecting the unique nature of each 
individual scene. in essence, there is no ‘right way’ to 
process the crime scene. the nature and scale of the crime, 
the police authority and investigating team in charge, and 
the resources available to them, will all have a bearing on 
the processing of the crime scene. notwithstanding, the 
scene of a serious crime (such as murder) will typically 
receive a much higher level of scrutiny than will one of a 
volume crime (such as burglary).
 A crime scene is a changing environment. therefore, in 
order to ensure that the maximum amount of information 
is retrieved from it, the crime scene should be processed 
without unnecessary delay. however, in order to be fully 
effective, actions taken during crime scene processing not 
only need to be timely but must also be scientifically and 
ethically sound, and legally acceptable.

originated from the attacker? Do you believe that DNA profiling in this case 
has the potential to prove beyond all doubt who the attacker was? Note that 
very small samples of blood can be used to reveal profiles based on nuclear 
DNA and that such samples can be obtained by rubbing a bloodstain with 
a sterile medical swab moistened, if necessary, with sterile water. Before 
answering this question, you might find it useful to read Chapter 6.
4. When obtaining control samples of glass from a broken window that was 
unlatched and opened in a case of suspected burglary, the SOCO took several 
pieces of glass that were still retained in the frame. Why do you think that 
several pieces of glass were taken? Do you think that it would have been 
better to have taken the samples from the ground beneath the window? If the 
Investigating Officer had reason to believe that this case was not a burglary 
but an insurance fraud perpetrated by the householder, might there be any 
benefit in unscrewing the window and submitting it in its entirety for forensic 
examination? You might find it useful to read Section 3.2 in Chapter 3 before 
answering the last part of this question.
5. When packaging dry non-trace items of physical evidence, it is common to use 
brown paper bags, each of which has a transparent plastic window incorporated 
in its construction. Why do you think that these bags are often preferred over 
either plain brown paper bags or plain transparent plastic bags?
6. A laboratory-based forensic scientist needs to gain access to a piece of 
physical evidence that is packaged in a brown paper bag. To do this, the 
scientist carefully inspects how the bag is sealed and then makes a clean 
incision through one side of the bag in an area that is distant from both the 
contents of the bag and any of the original seals. Once the analysis of the 
item of evidence is completed, the scientist returns it to its original package 
through the incision made earlier. This incision is then immediately sealed 
with clear plastic adhesive-coated tape. The scientist then signs across the 
seal and covers the signature with another piece of adhesive tape. Explain, as 
far as you are able, why the scientist carried out these operations.
7. You are attending an incident at a residential property where the body of a 
woman has been found in her bed. The woman’s husband reported the death. 
The Investigating Officer has expressed concerns relating to signs of recent 
unrest in the kitchen/diner area of the property. During the search, you have 
located a powered-on computer in a study, one powered-on iPhone and a 
powered-off Nokia handset, both in the kitchen/diner, two USB pen drives and 
a digital camera in the hallway. There is also a Sky+ box in the lounge. What 
actions should be taken in relation to each, assuming there will be no triage 
undertaken on site? During the processing of these devices at the scene, who 
will you interface with, at what point in the investigation and for what purpose? 
What information will you use to brief those that you interface with? What 
other non-digital information may you decide to search for?

Introduction
Much of forensic science is firmly rooted in Locard’s exchange principle that ‘every 
contact leaves a trace’. This trace may be in the form of a specific recoverable material, 
such as a chip of paint, or that of a mark or impression, such as a fingerprint. This 
chapter will deal with each of the main types of recoverable trace materials found 
at crime scenes, with the exception of body fluids (dealt with in Chapter 5), drugs 
of abuse (Chapter 7), gunshot residues (Chapter 9), those materials (known as fire 
accelerants) used by arsonists to promote combustion (Chapter 10) and explosives 
(Chapter 11). Marks and impressions are discussed in Chapter 4.
 
The evidence types that are covered in this chapter are hairs and other fibres, 
glass, soils, plant material and paint. A review of the other types of trace recoverable 
materials of forensic value is also included. For each evidence type, emphasis is given 
to an overview of the methods that are used to characterise the materials concerned. 
While specialised evidence recovery techniques are dealt with in this chapter (especially 
those used to recover fibres), the more general principles and methods used in the 
recovery of physical evidence are described in Chapter 2. As with all types of physical 
evidence, it is vitally important that the significance of recoverable trace evidence is 
properly evaluated. This topic is addressed in the final section of this chapter.

3.1 Hairs and other fibres
The term fibre (spelt fiber in the United States) is used to denote any solid object 
that is thin, flexible and elongate, having a high length to transverse cross-sectional 
area ratio. As shown in Figure 3.1, fibres of forensic interest can be classified on the 
basis of their origin and composition. Many of the types of fibre referred to in this 
figure are common objects. These include hairs, especially those of human origin, and 
those man-made and natural fibres that are formed into textile products (Chapter 4, 
Section 4.6) that are used in the manufacture of clothing and household fabrics.
 
Many of these common fibres are readily transferred from one object to another 
during physical contact. Indeed, a given fibre may be transferred more than once 
(Box 3.1). Interestingly, in most environmental conditions, these common types of 
fibre are resistant to biological, physical and chemical degradation and therefore 
persist intact for long periods of time. Furthermore, their examination provides 
multiple points of comparison that can enable them to be identified to the class 
level. For example, it is possible to determine the type of polymer (e.g. polyester) 
from which a particular man-made fibre is formed.
 The achievement of this class level of identification, coupled with the comparison 
of the characteristics exhibited by a questioned fibre obtained from an incident 
scene and a control fibre (such as that taken from the belongings of a suspect), 
can provide useful information. Importantly, such information is frequently enough 
to enable the fibre examiner involved to conclude that the two fibres are either 
different or, alternatively, sufficiently similar that they may have originated from 
the same source.

Many kinds of trace evidence, including fibres, are 
materials that are readily transferred from one object 
to another. This fact forms the basis of their ability to 
provide evidence of association. For example, a suspect 
might be associated with the scene of an incident by 
the presence on his or her clothing of traces of fibres, 
soil, glass, oil, paint and/or vegetation that match 
those found at the scene.
 
The fact that many types of trace evidence can 
be readily transferred once means that, in the main, 
they may easily be transferred again. This has four 
important implications, as outlined below:
 Great care has to be exercised in order to avoid the 
possibility of the cross-contamination of one item 
of evidence (e.g. a garment worn by a complainant 
in the case of an alleged assault) with items of trace 
evidence from another (e.g. fibres from a garment 
worn by the alleged assailant). The avoidance of 
cross-contamination is crucial in all forensic work 
and is reviewed in Chapter 2, Section 2.4.
 Under certain circumstances, items of trace evidence 
may be readily lost. Some such items, for example 
human hairs, are large enough to be observed either 
with the naked eye or with the aid of a magnifying 
glass. Such an individual item of trace evidence 
may be found at a crime scene on a larger piece of 
physical evidence (e.g. a bed sheet). If it is likely 
that the trace item will be lost from the larger item 
during transit from the crime scene, then it is prudent 
to document the trace item in situ before its recovery 
(Chapter 2, Section 2.4). The trace and larger items 
will then be separately packaged and labelled at the 
scene for subsequent laboratory examination. Also, 
the everyday actions of an individual will typically 
cause the majority of any transferred items of trace 
evidence (such as fibres, glass fragments or particles 
of gunshot residue) to be rapidly lost from his or 
her hair, skin and/or clothes. Therefore, in order to 
maximise the probability of finding such transferred 
trace evidence on a person, it should be looked for 
with the minimum of delay. Furthermore, it should 
be noted that the action of looking for one type 
of trace evidence could cause the loss of another. 
For example, glass fragments of forensic value are 
routinely searched for by shaking the garment on 
which they are believed to have alighted (Section 
3.2). This action may well also dislodge, and lose, 
evidentially valuable fibres that have been transferred 
to the garment. To avoid this loss, fibre samples can 
be obtained from the garment before it is shaken, by 
means of tape lifts (Section 3.1.1).
 It is quite common for items of trace evidence 
from one object to be transferred to another via an 
intermediary object, a process known as secondary 
transfer (direct transfer from one object to another 
is called primary transfer). For example, the 
presence of fibres from the fabric of a chair found 
on a person’s jacket might indicate that their jacket 
had been in contact with the chair. However, it 
might also be possible that the fibres from the chair 
were transported to the jacket via clothing worn by 
someone who had been in contact with the chair 
and then the jacket. Indeed, it is possible that there 
were two, three or even more intermediary objects 
involved, thus producing tertiary, quaternary, 
etc. transfers. Clearly, it is important that the 
possibility that items of trace evidence arrived on 
an object of interest by transfer subsequent to the 
primary transfer is taken into account during the 
interpretation of trace evidence.
 The everyday actions of people tend to quickly 
dislodge items of trace evidence that have been 
transferred to them and the clothing that they are 
wearing. However, it should be noted that there are 
circumstances under which transferred trace items 
may not be rapidly lost from a recipient object. 
Importantly, the death of an individual is typically 
accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the rate 
of loss from the deceased’s body and clothing of 
transferred fibres. Consequently, it is likely that 
the clothing of a murder victim that has come into 
contact with his or her killer will retain fibres from

Occasionally, the presence of highly unusual fibres and/or an unusual combination 
of fibre types can provide extremely strong evidence that links a suspect to a crime 
or series of crimes. This is well illustrated by the case of Wayne Bertram Williams 
(Box 3.2). Furthermore, fibre evidence can sometimes yield information of such 
high resolution that identification of the individual is possible. This can occur when 
the fibres concerned are actively growing human hairs that have been pulled out 
of the skin. If the roots of such hairs have cells from the hair follicles still adhered 
to them, there may be sufficient nuclear DNA available for the individual to be 
identified through DNA profiling. Although it is possible to extract DNA from the 
hair shaft irrespective of whether or not the hair was actively growing when it 
was detached from the skin, this is rarely done. This is because hair shaft DNA is 
mitochondrial and this is of lower evidential value than nuclear DNA. Finally, it is 
worth noting that the recent development of Low Copy Number DNA techniques 
means that it is now possible to obtain a DNA profile from the nuclei of the few 
Wayne Bertram Williams was convicted in 1982 of the 
murder of two men, both then aged in their 20s and 
both found in the Chattahoochee River. He was also 
linked in court to the murder of a further 10 young 
males. These 12 murders, together with the killing or 
disappearance of each of another 18 young African 
American people, all took place between the summers 
of 1979 and 1981 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
 
This was an extremely high-profile case and one 
in which fibre evidence played a very significant role. 
Importantly, the case against Williams included the 
presence on the bodies of victims of many different 
and, in most cases relatively uncommon, types of 
fibre that were linked to the defendant. For example, 
the victims of both of the murders for which Williams 
was convicted were found to have fibres on them that 
matched control fibres taken from each of four items 
(i.e. a bedspread, a carpet, a blanket and a dog) that 
were known to be in Williams’ everyday environment. 
Furthermore, the bodies of these two victims also 
had fibres on them that, while not present on both 
bodies, nonetheless matched further items in Williams’ 
environment. In one case there were three such further 
matches, while in the other case there were two.
 
Importantly, it was argued in court that the 
combination of different fibre matches meant that it 
was highly unlikely that their origin was other than 
that of the defendant’s environment. Williams was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms.

Case study
The conviction of Wayne Bertram Williams
the everyday environment of the murderer, even 
after several weeks of exposure to the elements. 
Indeed, in the case of the murders for which Wayne 
Williams was successfully prosecuted, it was argued 
that such fibres were retained on the bodies of the 
two victims concerned, even though they had both 
been retrieved from a river (Box 3.2). Significantly, 
the abrupt slowing in the loss rate of transferred 
fibres that accompanies death means that, under 
many circumstances, a high proportion of such fibres 
present on a murdered corpse are likely to have 
originated from the environment of the murder.

skin cells that may be adhered to the hair shaft as a consequence, for example, of 
dandruff. DNA profiling is dealt with in detail in Chapter 6.
 
In many cases, the likelihood of the transfer of fibres is heightened by violent 
contact. As a consequence, this type of physical evidence is often of particular value 
in cases of violent crime, such as assault, rape or murder. However, this is by no 
means exclusively the case. For example, a burglar may leave incriminating fibres 
from his or her clothing on reaching through a broken window in order to unlatch it.
 
Fibre evidence can be of value in crime scene reconstruction. Also, it may be 
instrumental in the furtherance of an investigation. For example, the presence 
of several similar, long, scalp hairs of human origin at the scene of a crime could 
strongly suggest that a person with, or who had, long hair has at some time been 
present at that scene. This information may prove to be important in assisting the 
police in their search for a victim or perpetrator of the crime or an eyewitness of the 
incident. However, as with most types of physical evidence, fibre evidence is most 
commonly used to help corroborate or refute a previously proposed link between 
an individual and a scene. In such cases, it is the job of the forensic scientist to 
compare the characteristics of fibres found at the scene (the questioned fibres) 
with those of control fibres taken from the individual concerned, or his or her 
belongings. Descriptions of the methods used to collect fibre evidence and those of 
fibre characterisation are given in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 respectively.
3.1.1 The recovery of fibre evidence
Consider a scenario in which there was a violent struggle during which a jumper 
worn by an assailant was brought into contact with a jacket worn by the victim. 
Under these circumstances, trace amounts of fibres from the jumper would 
normally be transferred to the jacket and vice versa. If, shortly after the incident, 
the victim were to report the crime to the police and a person who is suspected of 
being the assailant were to be detained, then fibre evidence taken from the jacket 
and the jumper could be of significant evidential value.
 
In order to obtain this evidence, two different types of sample would be taken from 
each of the jumper and the jacket. The first of these types is designed to obtain any 
trace-level fibres that were transferred during contact (the questioned fibres), while 
the second is intended to provide adequate control fibres from each of the garments.
 
During the forensic examination of the four samples so produced, the characteristics 
of the fibres of the control sample taken from the jumper would be compared with 
those of the questioned fibres obtained from the jacket in order to see if any of the 
fibres match. Similarly, a comparison would be made between the control samples 
taken from the jacket and the questioned fibres taken from the jumper – again to 
ascertain whether there are any matches.
 
The presence of matches would normally allow the investigators to state that 
their findings were consistent with an exchange of fibres between the two garments. 
Clearly, this information could constitute useful evidence that may, for example, 
be of value in testing the likely veracity of conflicting accounts of the incident as 
provided by the complainant and the suspect. On the other hand, the absence of 
matches is likely to lead the scientist to an inconclusive finding; that is, one that 
neither supports nor refutes any claim that the two garments had been in contact. 
 
The techniques used to obtain trace and control samples of the types alluded to 
above are quite different from each other, and are discussed below.
HAIRS AND OTHER FIBRES  65

 
The recovery of trace-level fibres
Any technique used to obtain trace-level fibres should ideally sample all of the types of 
fibre that have been transferred to the object being sampled without taking fibres from 
the object itself. Also, in many instances, it is desirable to obtain only those types of 
fibre that have been transferred to the object in the recent past. There are a number of 
approaches that can be adopted in order to attempt to achieve these objectives. These 
include hand picking with tweezers, using a vacuum cleaner fitted with a specialist 
attachment that directs the stream of air onto a paper or fabric filter, scraping, 
combing (of hair) and making tape lifts. All of the approaches have advantages. 
However, for the majority of work, tape lifting is usually the method of choice.
 
To create a tape lift, sticky tape is brought into contact (sometimes once, 
sometimes more than once) with the area to be sampled. Specialist tapes with 
different degrees of tackiness can be purchased for this purpose. The tape is then 
stuck to another suitable surface, such as a sheet of clear acetate plastic film, in 
order to keep it free from contamination. The tape lift is then systematically 
searched for fibres of interest (known as the target fibres). This is done by eye, 
with the aid of a low-power microscope, or by using one of the commercially 
available automated fibre finder systems. Once a target fibre has been identified, 
the dissection of the tape and the application of a small quantity of solvent (e.g. 
xylene) to dissolve the tape’s adhesive can enable it to be removed. The target fibre 
can then be mounted on a microscope slide for subsequent examination.
The recovery of control samples of textile fibres and  
human hair
The means by which control samples are taken should ideally obtain fibres that 
are representative of those that might have been transferred from the object being 
sampled while excluding any fibres that have been transferred to that object. The 
method used varies depending on whether the fibres to be sampled are those of a 
textile product or hair.
 
In the case of a textile product (most commonly a garment), the recovery of control 
samples can be achieved by teasing out individual fibres from those areas of the product 
that are least likely to be contaminated with foreign fibres (e.g. the seams). In doing 
this, it is important to bear in mind that there may well be several different types of fibre 
present in the product, any one of which has the potential to be evidentially valuable.
 
The procedures to be adopted when obtaining control samples of human hair for 
microscopic comparison with questioned hair should be founded on an understanding 
of the variation exhibited by the properties to be examined. An important consideration 
is that human hair not only varies from person to person but also varies from location 
to location on the same person. For example, the scalp hair of any one adult is different 
from his or her pubic hair. This means that control samples need to be obtained from 
all body locations that may have a bearing on the case.
 
Even the hairs of a single body location of a given individual (e.g. his or her scalp) 
show significant levels of variation in their physical characteristics when compared 
with the variation seen from individual to individual in the population. This means 
that, in order to obtain the maximum amount of value from a macroscopic and 
microscopic comparison of hairs recovered from the scene of an incident and those 
taken as a control sample, the number of hairs taken in the control sample should 
be fairly large. While there is no consensus about the exact number that is required,

30–50 hairs from each body location to be sampled would typically be considered to 
be enough. Also, as many of the characteristics of a given hair show variation along 
its length, from a scientific point of view it is best if the control hairs are taken by 
pulling them out of the skin, rather than cutting them.
 
It is worth noting that the circumstances of a case can sometimes aid the 
investigator in deciding from where on the body control samples of hair should be 
taken. For example, consider a case in which scalp hairs are found on a club that is 
suspected to have been used to hit someone on the head during an assault. Under 
these circumstances, it would be prudent to take control samples from the head of 
the victim in the area of the damage caused during the assault. This is because it is 
this area that is most likely to have been ‘sampled’ by the weapon used.
 
Finally, it must be noted that the collection of control samples must be 
undertaken with due regard to the legal rights of the people involved.
3.1.2  An overview of the examination and 
characterisation of hairs and other fibres
The forensic examination of fibres is primarily carried out in order to identify the 
individual fibre types (i.e. whether human scalp hair, nylon textile fibre, etc.) and to 
provide descriptions of characteristics that can be used as points of comparison between 
the fibres of interest. Much of this work is based on microscopic examination. However, 
the starting point is the inspection of the macroscopic features of the specimen, firstly 
with the unaided eye and then using a low-power stereomicroscope. In many cases the 
specimen, which might be a garment from which control fibres are to be taken or 
a tape lift on which questioned fibres are held (see Section 3.1.1), will be made up 
of multiple and various fibres. In such cases, the inspection of macroscopic features 
facilitates the selection and isolation of specific fibres for more detailed examination. 
In the case of tape lifts, this process may now be aided by the use of one of several 
commercially available automated fibre finder systems.
 
Once individual fibres have been isolated, they can be examined with a compound 
microscope, using visible and/or ultraviolet light. Such microscopes are capable 
of producing images at higher levels of magnification than the stereomicroscopes 
referred to above. In order to facilitate this higher magnification examination, each 
fibre is typically held in a mounting medium between a microscope slide and a thin 
glass cover slip. The mounting medium may be one that will eventually set solid 
(such as DePeX) to produce a permanent mount, or one that will not set (such as a 
mixture of glycerol and water) thus producing a temporary mount.
 
Whether permanent or temporary mounts are to be prepared, a mounting medium 
with a fairly similar refractive index (Box 3.3) to that of the fibre will be chosen. This 
will facilitate the penetration of light into the fibre, allowing internal features to be 
observed. However, this approach means that surface details are often difficult to see. 
Such details are particularly important in the examination of hairs, all of which have 
scales on their outermost surface. Therefore, to allow images of these surface details 
to be obtained with a light microscope, scale casts are made prior to the preparation 
of any permanent mounts. To prepare one of these casts, the hair concerned, except 
for a small portion at its root end, is embedded in a thin layer of a suitable varnish 
(such as clear nail lacquer), which has been freshly painted onto a surface of a 
microscope slide. Once the varnish is dry, the hair is then held by the protruding end 
and pulled out, leaving a cast of the scale pattern in the varnish (Figure 3.2).

Light does not travel at the same speed in all media 
through which it can pass. It moves fastest in a 
vacuum, as it is slowed down by interactions between 
it and the matter that makes up all other transparent 
media. The refractive index of a medium (symbol n) 
is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the 
speed of light in that medium. Therefore the value of n 
is exactly 1 for a vacuum and more than 1 for all other 
transparent media (although it very nearly equals 1 for 
air). Note that for a given transparent material, the 
value of n is dependent on both its temperature and 
the wavelength of the light that is passing through it.
 
All gases (including air), all liquids (except liquid 
crystals), unstressed glasses and unstressed crystals 
of cubic symmetry show no directional dependence 
on their interaction with light that is transmitted 
through them. Each example of any of these classes 
of materials therefore has only one refractive index 
for any given temperature and wavelength of light. 
These materials are said to be optically isotropic and 
are described as exhibiting optical isotropy. All other 
transparent substances are said to be optically anisotropic 
and to exhibit optical anisotropy.
 
In the forensic context, silicate glass (Section 3.2) 
is the most frequently encountered class of optically 
isotropic materials. The refractive index of fragments 
of glass is routinely measured as it provides a valuable 
point of comparison between questioned samples and 
controls.
 
The refractive index of any anisotropic substance 
depends not only on its temperature and the wavelength 
of the light passing through it but also on both the 
light’s direction of travel through the material and 
the light’s direction of vibration (see Box 3.5 for a 
description of what is meant by vibration direction). 
Included among the optically anisotropic substances 
are the vast majority of man-made fibres and most of 
the minerals that are made visible in soils by light 
microscopy. Both of these classes of material are 
commonly encountered in the forensic context, as 
discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 respectively.
 
An important property of optically anisotropic 
materials is that they are doubly refracting. That is, a 
beam of plane-polarized light that is made to pass 
through such a material appears to be resolved into two 
component beams, both travelling in the same general 
direction but with mutually perpendicular directions 
of vibration. The properties of any given specimen of 
optically anisotropic material coupled with the direction 
in which the light is shone through it will dictate the 
relative speed of these two beams. In every anisotropic 
material, there is either one or two such directions in 
which the two beams travel at identical speeds to 
one another. These directions are called optic axes. 
Thus all doubly refracting media have either one or 
two such axes and are therefore referred to as being 
either uniaxial or biaxial respectively. In all directions 
other than that of an optic axis, the two beams travel 
at different speeds; that is, they experience different 
refractive indices. Birefringence is the name given to 
the numerical value of the difference between these 
two refractive indices, the maximum value of which is 
characteristic of the material concerned. This maximum 
is often referred to as the birefringence of the material. 
Once it has been determined, the birefringence of a 
material can be compared with typical values, such as 
those given for man-made fibres in Appendix 1, in order 
to help to establish the class of material being observed. 
Birefringence can also act as a point of comparison 
between questioned and control samples.
 
The birefringence, and a number of other useful 
optical properties, of fibres and minerals, is routinely 
established using polarized-light microscopy. The 
application of this technique to man-made fibres is 
expanded upon in Box 3.5.

Plate 9  This picture shows a full DNA profile obtained from a lip-print on a glass using the AmpFL STR® SGM Plus™ (SGM+) system.  
Aspects of this type of profiling are discussed throughout Chapter 6. The DNA profile shows the genotype of the source individual at 
11 genetic loci.  The range in size of the alleles at each locus is indicated by the shaded bar above the peaks, which also gives the locus 
name.  Each peak is labelled with the size of the peak in base-pairs (sz) and the corresponding allele number (al). For example, at the 
D3S1358 locus there is a peak of size 119.78 bp, of allele 14, and also a peak of size 136.16 bp, of allele 18. At this locus the genotype

 The procedures described in the preceding paragraph allow longitudinal images 
of fibres to be observed. Slides that enable transverse cross-sections to be inspected 
can be prepared by placing thin slices of the fibre concerned in a suitable mounting 
medium between a glass slide and cover slip. For some applications, the alternative 
view that is offered by these slides can be informative. For example, human beard 
hairs are frequently triangular in transverse cross-section, whereas human scalp hairs 
are rarely so. Also, some carpet fibres are seen to be characteristically trilobate (i.e. 
three lobed) in transverse cross-section.
 
During the forensic examination of fibres using light microscopy, their 
morphological features are described (see Box 3.4 for information on the morphology 
of hair), as are their optical properties (e.g. colour, any fluorescence under ultraviolet 
light and, as described in Boxes 3.3 and 3.5, birefringence). In order to ensure that these 
examinations are thorough, they are often carried out with the aid of protocol sheets 
that prompt the examiner to look for specific characteristics. Where appropriate, 
numerical parameters are used to quantify the observed attributes (such as thickness and 
birefringence). When considered together, the set of characteristic properties 
possessed by any one fibre, as revealed by light microscopy, is usually sufficient to 
allow its type to be identified. For example, polyester fibres are readily distinguished 
from acrylic ones (Box 3.5). Moreover, the set of characteristics exhibited by one 
fibre (e.g. a questioned fibre) can be compared with those observed in another (e.g. a 
control fibre) to see whether they match.

A hair is a fibre that grows out of a hair follicle in the 
skin of a mammal. At one end of any one hair is its root. 
Unless the hair has been pulled out, this is found within 
the skin. At the other end is the hair’s tip. The hair 
shaft is the main portion of the hair that lies between 
the root and the tip.
 
A longitudinal view of a mature hair shaft, as seen 
using a light microscope (see figure (a) overleaf), 
shows it to contain up to three main morphological 
features, namely:
 the cuticle (the outer layer of the hair shaft, made 
up of tough, flattened cells called scale cells);
 the cortex (made up of spindle-shaped (i.e. fusiform) 
cortical cells, which are cemented together);
 the medulla (made up of collapsed cells, and 
intercellular and intracellular air-filled voids).
The first two of these features are present in all cases 
but the medulla may be absent.
 
The morphological study of hair has revealed 
a number of forensically valuable observations, in  
particular those listed below:
 There are species-to-species variations in the 
structural detail observable within hair. This means 
that it may well be possible to identify from which 
species a given sample of hair originated on the 
basis of its morphology alone. Forensically, a 
fundamental distinction of this type is that between 
human and non-human hair. In order to make this 
distinction, the examiner can make use of the 
following observations:
– The colour of a human hair typically shows 
relatively little variation along the length of the 
shaft, whereas that of a non-human will often 
show dramatic changes in colour and/or banding.
– The width of the medulla (where present) divided 
by the width of the shaft (a parameter known as 
the medullary index) is typically less than 1/3  
in human hair and greater than 1/3 in non-
human hair.
– The appearance of the medulla (where present) 
is different in human and non-human hairs. In 
the former, it is typically not continuous and 
shows little structure when observed using light 
microscopy, whereas in the latter it typically has 
a well-defined structure (e.g. like a ladder), is 
continuous but varies in its appearance along 
the length of the shaft.
– Where seen, the pigment granules in human 
hair (which are nearly all in the cortex) tend 
to be evenly distributed across the width of the 
shaft – with a slightly greater density towards 
the cuticle. In non-human hair, the pigment is 
typically either centrally located or has a greater 
granule density towards the medulla.
– The scale pattern of human hair typically does 
not vary greatly along the length of the shaft 
(although the level of damage to the scale margins 
may well increase from the root end to the tip). 
In contrast, the scale pattern of non-human hairs 
often varies significantly from hair root to tip.
 It is often possible to use morphology to deduce 
from which part of the body a given human hair 
originated (e.g. scalp hair is morphologically 
distinguishable from pubic hair).
 Human hair morphology carries indications of 
racial type. For example, the scalp hairs of Negroid 
peoples typically have a more flattened shape in 
transverse cross-section compared with the scalp 
hairs of Mongoloid peoples.
 The root of a human scalp hair that was pulled out 
while the hair was actively growing (i.e. in the anagen 
phase of the growth cycle) is characteristically flame-
shaped (see figure (b) overleaf) or broken, and may 
have follicular material attached to it. In contrast, a 
human scalp hair that was detached from the skin after 
the hair had ceased growing (i.e. it was in the telogen 
phase of the growth cycle when it was removed) has 
a root with a characteristic club-like appearance (see 
figure (c) overleaf). Hair in the anagen phase is much 
harder to pull out of the scalp than that in the telogen 
phase. Hence, the presence of an anagen phase root 
is symptomatic of a hair that has been pulled out 
with a significant amount of force. (Note that there 
Box 3.4

The forensic study of the shape (i.e. morphology) of hair

is a phase in the growth cycle of human scalp hair 
between those of anagen and telogen. This is called 
the catagen phase, in which growth is slowing down. 
Catagen hairs are relatively rare and their roots, when 
pulled out, are typically club-shaped and often have 
follicular material attached.)
 Morphology can reveal differences between hairs 
taken from the same body location on different  
individual humans. For example, the scalp hairs of 
one person might be significantly thicker than those 
of another. Unfortunately, there is also considerable 
variation in the morphological characteristics of the 
hairs of any one individual. To give an extreme but 
common example, people with grey hair actually have 
a mixture of colourless (or nearly colourless) hairs 
and coloured ones. This has implications for both the  
collection of control hairs for forensic purposes and 
the interpretation of evidence based on morphological 
comparisons. It also means that, in order to maximise 
the possibility of resolution between individuals, 
a wide range of morphological features should be 
observed and described in each hair examined. The 
main morphological points of comparison used to 
evaluate associative evidence based on human hair 
include:
– the colour, length, waviness and diameter of 
each individual hair;
– the size, shape, density and distribution of 
observable pigment granules in each hair shaft;
– cosmetic alteration of each hair;
– damage to each hair, including any caused by 
disease or dietary deficiency;
– the presence or absence of nits or fungal infection;
– the shape of the cross-section of the hair shaft.

Note that the morphological comparison of questioned 
and control samples of human hair will only very rarely 
enable the examiner to identify the individual who 
provided the questioned sample as being the same 
person who supplied the control sample. In other 
words, with very few exceptions, hair morphology is 
not capable of individualisation. However, it may well 
enable the examiner to conclude that either two hair 
samples are sufficiently similar to have originated from 
the same person or that they are significantly different 
and therefore did not come for the same individual. In 
either case, this can be highly valuable information.
Box 3.4 continued
Natural and plane-polarized light
In order to appreciate the value of polarized-light 
microscopy, it is first necessary to understand the 
difference between natural and plane-polarized light. 
To do this, it is best to picture light as being made 
up of waves. By way of an analogy, consider a rope 
that is held taut between an eyebolt in a wall and 
someone’s hand. Each wave of light has some similarity 
with the travelling wave that can be produced in that 
rope when the hand is moved up and down or side to 
side, or indeed in any other imaginable direction that 
is across the direction of travel of the wave along 
the rope. The direction in which the hand is moved is 
called the vibration direction. In this analogy, natural 
light would be represented if waves with very many 
vibration directions were created and superimposed. 
If the rope were made to pass through a gap in closely 
spaced railings made up of vertical bars, then only waves 
with a vertical vibration direction would be propagated 
beyond the railings concerned, as all other waves would 
crash into the bars. Consequently, on the far side of the  
railings, only light with a vibration direction in the 
vertical plane would exist. This is analogous to plane-
polarized light as this too has only one vibration 
direction plane. Polaroid is a commercially available 
plastic sheet material that only allows light with one 
vibration direction plane to pass through it. That is, if 
natural light is shone upon one side of it, plane-polarized 
light emerges from the other side. In the analogy 
discussed above, a sheet of Polaroid does to light what 
the railings did to the waves passing down the rope.
Polarized-light microscopes
The defining characteristic of polarized-light 
microscopes is that each contains both a polarizer and 
an analyser. Each of these is a device, usually a sheet 
of Polaroid, that will produce plane-polarized light when 
it is illuminated with natural light. There are polarized-
light microscopes that can be used to view specimens in 
reflected light; however, it is normal to observe fibres 
in transmitted light (i.e. light that is passed through 
the specimen). The description given here is that of 
the essential features of a polarized-light microscope 
designed to be used with transmitted light. As shown in 
Plate 1, in such microscopes the polarizer and analyser 
are situated below and above the stage on which the 
specimen is placed, respectively. This means that the 
specimen is illuminated in plane-polarized light. 
 
As illustrated in Plate 2, the top of the image seen 
when looking down the microscope is labelled as north. 
Similarly, the bottom is labelled south, the right-hand 
side east and the left-hand side west. It is possible to 
rotate the polarizer so that the vibration direction of 
the plane-polarized light that it produces is between 
any two opposite points of the compass. However, 
it is conventional to position the polarizer such that 
the light that shines on the specimen vibrates in the  
east–west direction. 
Box 3.5
Forensic techniques
Observations of man-made fibres using polarized-light microscopy
 72  TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART I: RECOVERABLE MATERIALS

 
 
The normal orientation of the analyser is such 
that it will only allow light to pass through it that is 
vibrating north–south. The analyser can be moved in 
or out of the light path. When it is out of this path, 
the sample is being observed in plane-polarized light. 
In contrast, when it is in this path and the polarizer 
and analyser are in their conventional orientations, the 
specimen is said to be viewed under crossed polars.
 
Other important characteristics of polarized-light 
microscopes are that:
 the stage can rotate freely in the plane that is 
perpendicular to the path taken by the light that is 
made to travel through the specimen; 
 there is an accessory plate slot between the 
polarizer and the analyser (see Plate 1).
The optical properties of man-made fibres
The vast majority of man-made fibres are optically 
anisotropic (see Box 3.3); these are uniaxial, with the 
optic axis running down the length of the fibre. As 
expected, an optically anisotropic fibre will apparently 
split light that passes through it in any direction other 
than along its optic axis into two plane-polarized beams 
travelling at different speeds. As the refractive index 
(see Box 3.3) experienced by a beam of light is inversely 
proportional to its speed, the slow beam experiences a 
higher refractive index than the fast one. The difference 
between the speeds of the beams is maximal, as is the 
difference between the refractive indices that the beams 
experience, when the light that passes through the 
fibre does so at right-angles to the fibre’s optic axis. 
The birefringence value (Γ) of the fibre is the maximum 
absolute value of the numerical difference between the 
two refractive indices, thus:
Γ = uni – n⊥u
in which, respectively, the subscripts i and ⊥ represent 
the beam that vibrates parallel to the fibre’s optic axis 
and the other that vibrates perpendicular to this axis.
 
For most types of fibres ni > n⊥, but for some (e.g. 
those made of acrylic) ni < n⊥. Those fibres with ni > n⊥ 
are said to have a positive sign of elongation, whereas 
those in which ni < n⊥ have a negative sign of elongation.
The optical path difference and polarization colours
As described in Box 3.3, each optically anisotropic object 
appears to split light that is shone through it into two 
plane-polarized beams, which travel in essentially the 
same direction as each other. Unless travelling along 
the direction of an optic axis, these beams travel at 
different speeds through the object concerned. This 
means that the front of one draws ahead of the front of 
the other. When the beams emerge from the anisotropic 
material into an optically isotropic material (such as air, 
unstressed glass or the mounting medium used to make 
the microscope slide), unless they enter another optically 
anisotropic object, the distance between these fronts 
does not alter. This distance is called the optical path 
difference (OPD). An optically anisotropic object that is 
observed under crossed polars will appear to be black 
in specific orientations to the incoming plane-polarized 
light. These are when the incoming light travels along an 
optic axis or when the vibration direction of the incoming 
light is coincidental with the vibration direction of one of 
the two beams. In all other orientations, the object will 
appear to be brighter than the background and, in many 
instances, highly coloured.
 
To understand the origin of these colours, it is 
necessary to appreciate that white light is made up of all 
of the colours of light’s spectrum (i.e. the colours of the 
rainbow). Each wavelength of light has its own colour, for 
example light with a wavelength (λ) of 410 nm is violet, 
whereas that with λ = 710 nm is red. If light with specific 
wavelengths is removed from white light, the remaining 
mixture of wavelengths is perceived by the eye as being a 
particular colour.
 
The colours that are seen when an optically 
anisotropic object is viewed under crossed polars are 
called polarisation colours (also known by the more 
general term interference colours). These occur because, 
depending on the OPD, interactions in the analyser 
remove, to varying extents, light of specific wavelengths 
from the white light that illuminated the specimen. What 
is left is light of a mixture of wavelengths, which is seen 
as a specific colour. 
 
Therefore when a colourless specimen is illuminated 
in white light and viewed under crossed polars, the 
exact polarisation colour seen will be determined by 
Box 3.5 continued
s
HAIRS AND OTHER FIBRES  73

 
the OPD of the specimen. This, in turn, is dependent on 
the thickness of the specimen (t) and its birefringence 
(Γ), thus:
OPD = t × Γ 
Eq 1
Consider an object of constant birefringence (e.g. a 
piece of quartz) that has been cut to form a wedge 
such that the vibration directions of its two beams are 
parallel and perpendicular to the direction in which the 
wedge alters in thickness. The OPD produced by this 
object will start at zero when its thickness is zero and 
will increase as it becomes progressively thicker, such 
that at all locations its OPD accords with Equation 
1 given above. Therefore, if this object is viewed in 
crossed polars, all of the polarisation colours up to 
that of the maximum OPD produced by the wedge will 
be seen. This is shown in Plate 3.
Determining the birefringence and sign of 
elongation of a man-made fibre
Plate 2 shows a dye-free (i.e. colourless) man-made 
fibre viewed in crossed polars. It is a cylindrical fibre 
and so its width (w) equals the thickness (t) that is 
experienced by light travelling through the centre of 
the fibre, as shown in the following diagram:
The width can be determined using, for example, a 
calibrated scale in the eyepiece of the microscope. 
In order to find the birefringence (Γ), Equation 1 is 
rearranged to give:
       OPD
Γ = –––– 
Eq 2
         t
As t can be found readily, all that is required is the 
value of the OPD, which should be available from the 
colour in the centre of the fibre. Plate 4 shows how 
the polarisation colours change with increasing OPD. 
Noting that the centre of the fibre is blue, all that 
should be required is to look along Plate 4 from left to 
right until the colour blue is found and then read the 
OPD that corresponds to this colour from the scale at 
the bottom. However, there is a problem: there are two 
blue colours on Plate 4, one with an OPD of 580 nm 
and the other with an OPD of 1150 nm.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution to this difficulty. 
Consider what happens if a second optically anisotropic 
material, known as an accessory plate, is placed into 
the light path between the polarizer and the analyser, 
such that the vibration directions of its two beams 
are coincidental with those of the fibre. There are two 
possible outcomes:
 the OPD of the accessory plate will add to that of 
the fibre and the polarisation colour on Plate 4 that 
corresponds to that seen when looking down the 
microscope will be further to the right than before; or
 the OPD of the accessory plate will subtract from that 
of the fibre and the polarisation colour on Plate 4 
that corresponds to that seen when looking down the 
microscope will be further to the left than before.
The first of these, which will be referred to here as an 
addition, will occur if the vibration direction of the 
slow beam in the accessory plate is coincidental with 
that of the slow beam in the fibre. The second (i.e. 
subtraction) will happen if the vibration direction of 
the slow beam in the accessory plate is coincidental 
with that of the fast beam in the fibre.
 
If a subtraction occurs such that the OPD of the 
accessory plate is exactly the same as that of the fibre, 
then the total OPD will be zero and, in accordance 
with Plate 4, the centre of the fibre will be black. So, 
one approach would be to have a series of accessory 
plates made, all identical except that each would have 
a different but known OPD. One of these would be 
placed in the accessory plate slot of the microscope 
and its stage would be rotated to the position in which 
Box 3.5 continued

subtraction was seen to occur. Then each plate would 
be tested in turn until the centre of the fibre went 
black. The OPD of the fibre would then be known, as it 
would be the same as that of this plate.
 
However, an alternative, and more convenient, 
method would be to insert a wedge of the type described 
previously into the accessory plate slot, with the stage 
rotated to the subtraction position as described above. 
This wedge will be wider than the fibre, so that it can 
be seen either side of the fibre. If the wedge is pushed 
into the field of view, the polarisation colours outside 
the fibre will be those of the wedge alone and will move 
progressively to the right as shown on Plate 4. At the 
same time, because the OPD of the plate is subtracting from 
that of the fibre, the polarisation colours in the fibre will 
move progressively to the left, as shown on Plate 4. The 
colour in the centre of the fibre will go black (called 
compensation black) once the point has been reached 
where the polarisation colour of the wedge when viewed 
alone is the same as that of the centre of the fibre in the 
absence of the wedge. This situation is shown in Plate 
5. In the case of the fibre shown in Plate 5, in order 
to achieve the position shown, the wedge had to be 
pushed in until the second blue produced by the wedge 
alone was seen. This is now known to be the polarisation 
colour of the centre of the fibre in the absence of the 
wedge. From Plate 4, it can be seen that this equates to 
an OPD of 1150 nm. Notice that the scale on Plate 4 is 
divided into what are called orders. Each colour on Plate 
4 is known by its name and the order in which it appears. 
As the second blue appears in the third order, it is called 
third-order blue. The width of the fibre is 19.6 µm. As 
this is a cylindrical fibre, its width equals the thickness 
(t) of its centre, in nanometres (nm). This equals 
19.6 × 1000 = 19 600 nm. These figures for OPD and t can 
be used in Equation (2) to find the birefringence of the 
fibre (note that it is crucially important that OPD and t 
are in the same units before this is done):
       OPD      1150 nm
Γ = –––– = –– ––––––– = 0.059
         t       19 600 nm
From tables such as that provided in Appendix 1, it 
can be seen that this value is consistent with the fibre 
being made of nylon 6.6, which in fact it is.
 
This process has also provided the information 
necessary to establish the fibre’s sign of elongation. 
This is possible because, as indicated in Plate 5, the 
vibration direction of the wedge’s slow beam is known 
(it is marked on the wedge by the manufacturer). In this 
case, it is perpendicular to the direction in which the 
wedge becomes thicker, and, as indicated in Plate 5, it 
runs northeast–southwest. As subtraction has occurred, 
it is known that the vibration direction of the wedge’s 
slow beam is coincidental with that of the fibre’s fast 
beam. The fibre’s fast beam is therefore vibrating at 
right-angles to the fibre’s optic axis. As the fast beam 
is the one that experiences the lower refractive index, in 
this case this must be n⊥, and so it is known that ni > n⊥, 
which is a positive sign of elongation (as expected for 
nylon).
 
There are a number of other means by which the sign 
of elongation of a birefringent fibre may be established. 
These include the use of a first-order red tint plate, as 
discussed below. It is commonly the case, however, that 
the sign of elongation of the fibre will not have been 
established before the quartz wedge is placed into the 
accessory plate slot. Under these circumstances, it is 
not possible to tell whether the fibre should be aligned 
northwest–southeast or northeast–southwest in order 
for subtraction to occur. However, this is not a problem. 
If the fibre is aligned northwest–southeast and the 
quartz wedge is inserted in the accessory plate slot, 
then the polarisation colours in the centre of the fibre 
will be seen to move either to the right or to the left 
on Plate 4. If they move to the left, then subtraction 
is occurring.  However, if they move to the right (i.e. 
the colours become progressively higher in their order) 
as the thickness of the quartz wedge increases, then 
addition is happening.  If the latter is observed, then 
the wedge is removed from the microscope and the stage 
is then rotated through 90°, so that the fibre now runs 
northeast–southwest. When the wedge is now reinserted 
in the accessory plate slot, subtraction will be observed.
 
In addition to the quartz wedge, there are other 
accessory plates that are of value. Included in these is 
the first-order red tint plate. This is a piece of optically 
anisotropic material (e.g. gypsum) that is cut such that 
it is of uniform thickness and has a OPD that is near to  
550 nm and is either known (e.g. 530 nm) or assumed 
to be 550 nm. The vibration directions of its slow and 
fast beams are known and marked on the plate by the 
Box 3.5 continued

HAIRS AND OTHER FIBRES  75

 
manufacturer. This type of plate is particularly useful 
in estimating the OPD of fibres with first-order grey 
polarisation colours. Plates 6, 7 and 8 show such a fibre. 
In Plate 6, it is shown as it appears under crossed polars. 
In Plate 7, a first-order red tint plate has been placed 
into the accessory plate slot. The fibre and plate together 
are second-order turquoise in colour and from Plate 4 this 
can be seen to be due to a total OPD of approximately 
650 nm. Plate 8 is the same as Plate 7, except that the 
stage has been rotated by 90°. Now the polarisation 
colour is first-order orange, which from Plate 4 can be 
seen to be the result of a total OPD of approximately 
410 nm. The image in Plate 7 has occurred because the 
OPD of the first-order red tint plate (530 nm in this case) 
has added to that of the fibre. Hence, the fibre’s OPD 
is 650 – 530 = 120 nm. In contrast, the image in Plate 
8 shows a polarisation colour that is due to the OPD of 
the fibre subtracting from that of the plate (530 – 120 = 
410 nm). This has confirmed that the estimated OPD of 
120 nm derived from the observed colour seen in Plate 
7 is a reasonable number. From this and the knowledge 
that this cylindrical fibre is 30 600 nm (i.e. 30.6 µm × 
1000) wide, the birefringence can be estimated as:
      OPD      120 nm
Γ = –––– = –– ––––––– = 0.0039 
Eq 3
        t      30 600 nm
Note that the sign of elongation of this fibre can be 
deduced from the information provided by either of 
Plates 7 or 8. Using Plate 7 to show how this can be 
done, note that the direction of vibration of the slow 
beam of the first-order red tint plate is northeast–
southwest. Addition has occurred to create the colour 
seen in the fibre in Plate 7. Therefore, the direction 
of vibration of the slow beam of the fibre must also 
be northeast–southwest. As the optic axis of the fibre 
runs northwest–southeast, the slow beam is the one 
that moves under the influence of n⊥ (i.e. not ni). As 
the slow beam experiences the higher refractive index, 
ni < n⊥, which is a negative sign of elongation.
 
This, coupled with a comparison between the 
data given in Appendix 1 and the estimate of the 
birefringence given by Equation 3, suggests that this 
fibre is acrylic. This indeed is the case.
 
As can be seen from the descriptions provided above, 
both the quartz wedge and the first-order red tint plate 
provide means by which man-made fibres can be rapidly 
characterised. Furthermore, in many instances, the 
information that is provided by these means can lead 
to the identification of the polymer type from which the 
fibre has been made. For these reasons, these devices 
are in common use in the forensic examination of man-
made fibres. However, they do have limitations. Quartz 
wedges produce their best results with undamaged 
cylindrical fibres, the centres of which exhibit 
polarisation colours somewhere between and including 
first-order yellow and third-order red. Arguably, first-
order red tint plates are most useful for colourless, 
undamaged cylindrical man-made fibres that exhibit 
first-order polarisation colours in their centres.
 
Note also that there are more accurate ways of 
establishing the OPD than those described above 
(including the use of tilting compensators or Senarmont 
compensators) and the estimation of the thickness of 
non-cylindrical fibres is more challenging than that of 
the cylindrical fibres described above. However, these 
topics are beyond the scope of this book.
 
Furthermore, although birefringence measurements 
and sign of elongation determinations are frequently 
carried out for man-made fibres, they are rarely 
determined for natural fibres. This is despite the fact 
that natural fibres are optically anisotropic. The reason 
for this is that other features of natural fibres (such as 
their morphologies) are more discriminating than are 
birefringence and sign of elongation.

The direct comparison, in the same field of view, of two fibres can provide the 
examiner with an extremely powerful aid in the confirmation or refutation of a 
match between the fibres concerned. This is facilitated by the use of a comparison 
microscope. As can be seen from Figure 3.3, instruments of this type have two 
identical stages on which the slides of the two fibres can be placed and may have both 
visible and ultraviolet light sources. Crucially, they have carefully balanced optics, 
enabling both fibres to be viewed under identical conditions.
 
An electromagnetic spectrum of an object is an expression of the intensity of the 
absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation by that object as a function of 
the energy or frequency of that radiation. A range of microspectrometers can be 
used to obtain a variety of electromagnetic spectra from single fibres. Using these, 
it is now possible to obtain ultraviolet, visible, Raman and infrared spectra that not 
only provide additional points of comparison between questioned and control fibres 
but may also yield information about the chemical composition of the fibres and/
or any dyes or pigments present. Such spectroscopic techniques can be particularly 
useful in the examination of man-made fibres. A description of ultraviolet and visible 
spectroscopy is given in Box 3.6, while infrared and Raman spectroscopies are 
described in Box 3.10 later in the chapter.
 
There are a number of other techniques that can be used to further characterise 
fibres and to produce additional points of comparison. Among these are the following:
 Dye extraction from questioned and control fibres, followed by thin-layer 
chromatography (Chapter 11, Box 11.5).
 Microchemical tests that can be carried out on the dyes and/or pigments of 
small sections of fibre that have been placed on microscope slides beneath 
cover slips. Under these circumstances, the fibre sections can be exposed to 
liquid reagents (such as bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution) or concentrated 
sulphuric acid) by placing a small drop of the reagent concerned on an edge of 
the cover slip. Capillary action will then draw the reagent under the cover slip 
and around the fibre. Any observable colour changes can then be viewed with a 
compound light microscope and used as points of comparison.
 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which is particularly good at providing 
details of surface morphology (Chapter 9, Box 9.7).
 Melting point determination, which is applicable to many man-made fibres.
 Pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Chapter 11, Box 11.5) of man-made fibres.
 The ashing of natural fibres followed by microscopic examination of the 
residues.
While the presence of matches between fibres obtained from different sources 
(e.g. a suspect and a crime scene) can provide valuable associative evidence, 
the interpretation of the significance of such evidence must be carried out with 
great care. This is because due regard has to be paid to such issues as the rate of 
transfer of fibre evidence, the persistence of fibres on garments and other items, 
the potential for secondary and even tertiary transfer, and the frequency of different 
fibre types in the environment.

The study of how electromagnetic radiation interacts 
with matter is called spectroscopy. This study reveals 
that the energy states that molecules, atoms or ions 
can possess are quantised. That is, while a given atom, 
ion or molecule in a given chemical environment can 
exist in any one of an infinite number of energy states, 
it cannot reside in an energy state that is intermediate 
between two adjacent states. To illustrate this with an 
approximate analogy, a ball bouncing down a flight of 
stairs can alight on any one of the treads, each one 
being analogous to an energy state. However, it cannot 
come to rest at a point in space between two treads.
 
A molecule, atom or ion can absorb energy from 
incident electromagnetic radiation if Bohr’s frequency 
condition is satisfied:
∆E = hν 
 
Eq 1
where h is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of the 
incident radiation and ∆E is the difference in energy 
between two quantised energy states E and E' (higher 
energy), i.e. 
∆E = E' – E
The molecule, atom or ion can be excited from E to 
E' by absorbing radiation and then revert from E' to E

by emitting radiation. The frequency of the radiation 
concerned is determined by Equation 1 and, when 
travelling in a vacuum, its wavelength (l) is given by:
l = c–   
Eq 2
      υ
where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which to 
three significant figures is 3.00 × 108 m s–1. Note that 
the speed of light (or other electromagnetic radiation) 
and its wavelength are both decreased when it passes 
through a material (e.g. air or glass), such that the ratio 
of the speed of light to its wavelength remains constant. 
The frequency of the radiation remains unaltered by 
the medium through which it travels. This means that 
Equation 2 will also yield the correct wavelength of 
radiation with a given frequency that is passing through 
a material, provided that the speed of light in that 
material is substituted for c. Note that the speed of light 
is little altered when it passes through air; consequently, 
to a very good approximation, Equation 2 holds true for 
electromagnetic radiation passing through air.
 
With rare exceptions, atoms, molecules and 
ions each contain electrons. In each case, these 
electrons reside in a diffuse, yet ordered, cloud. 
This is located around the atomic nucleus or (in the 
case of a molecule) nuclei, in which the remainder 
of the matter of the atom, ion or molecule resides. 
Furthermore, these electrons are located in what are 
known as orbitals, each of which is capable of holding 
up to two electrons. If electromagnetic radiation of 
suitable frequency, ν, is absorbed by an atom, ion or 
molecule, this can excite it via the promotion of one 
of its electrons from the orbital in which it is found (of 
energy E) to one that is either unoccupied or partially 
occupied and that has an energy of E'. By undergoing 
this electronic transition, the energy of the atom, ion 
or molecule will increase by E'– E. As described earlier 
in this box, in order for this to occur, Bohr’s frequency 
condition must be satisfied, that is:
E ' – E = ∆E = hν
For such electronic transitions, the values of ν that 
satisfy this condition correspond to electromagnetic 
radiation in the ultraviolet–visible region of the 
spectrum. This region extends over the frequency range 
of approximately 3.85 × 1014 to 3.00 × 1015 Hz, that 
is radiation with wavelengths, when measured in air, 
in the approximate range 780 to 100 nm. Standard 
ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometers1 that are used 
in the laboratory do not operate over exactly this 
range but from 190 to 900 nm.

Many molecules of forensic interest, including textile 
dyes and drugs, absorb in the ultraviolet–visible region 
and so show one or more typically broad absorption 
bands in their ultraviolet–visible spectra. For transparent 
materials, the spectrum of the sample under test can be 
obtained by using a scanning spectrometer that can plot 
the absorbance (defined by Equation 3, given below) of 
the sample as a function of wavelength. This spectrum 
provides class characteristics of the sample under study. 
As shown in the figure opposite, these include the value 
of the wavelength of maximum absorbance (lmax) for 
each of its absorption bands.
 
In some cases, quantification of a known analyte that 
absorbs in the ultraviolet–visible region is conveniently 
achieved using spectrophotometric methods. In these 
methods, the absorbance (defined below) of a solution 
of the analyte, or a derivative of the analyte, is measured 
at one or more wavelengths and used to establish the 
concentration of the chemical species of interest. In the 
vast majority of cases, the Beer–Lambert law (defined 
below) is complied with when a solution of the analyte 
or its derivative is illuminated with monochromatic 
(i.e. single wavelength) radiation of an energy that is 
absorbed by the chemical species concerned. This law 
states that:
A = kcb
where:
 A is the absorbance of the solution at the 
wavelength that is being used. Absorbance is 
defined by the following equation:
 
A = log ( 
I0––I )  
Eq 3
 
in which I0 is the intensity of the radiation before it 
has passed through the sample and I is the intensity of 
the radiation after it has passed through the sample.
 k (a constant) is the absorptivity of the solution at 
the wavelength that is being used.
 c is the concentration of the analyte or derivative 
under study.
 b is the distance that the radiation passes through 
the absorbing medium (b is called the path length).
Note that A has no units and the units of k are such that 
they will cancel out with those of c and b. Commonly 
used units for c and b are g dm–3 and cm respectively, in 
which case, the units of k are dm3 cm–1 g–1.
 
If a series of standard solutions, each containing 
a known but different concentration (c) of the analyte 
(or its derivative), is prepared and the value of A is 
determined for each of these then, according to 
the Beer–Lambert law, a plot of c (horizontal axis) 
against A will produce a straight line. If the value of 
A is then determined for the solution under test, the 
concentration of the analyte (or its derivative) within 
this solution can be determined by the interpolation of 
this calibration plot.
 
There are ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometric 
methods that are effective in the analysis of mixtures 
that contain more than one chemical species that 
absorb in this region of the spectrum. However, 
complex mixtures of such species will usually have to be 
separated, to produce samples of greater purity, prior to 
quantification by ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry. 
In many cases, this separation can be achieved by high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Chapter 11, 
Box 11.5).
 
In many forensic applications, the samples of 
interest have microscopic dimensions. For example, 
a synthetic fibre will typically be thinner than 20 µm. 
Similarly, a paint chip that is made up of multiple coats 
of different paints will contain layers of microscopic 
thickness. Microspectrophotometers, which are 
microscopes combined with spectrophotometers, have 
been developed that can establish the ultraviolet–
visible spectroscopic properties of such microscopic 
samples. Unsurprisingly, the use of these instruments is 
known as microspectrophotometry.

3.2 Glass
Glass is the name given to a class of hard, brittle materials that are manufactured 
by cooling melts consisting of silica (SiO2) mixed with varying amounts of other 
oxides. These other oxides are most commonly those of sodium or potassium (or 
both), together with those of calcium, magnesium, aluminium and/or lead(II).
 
The most frequently encountered type of glass is soda-lime glass, which is used 
to produce windows and containers such as bottles and drinking glasses. It is made 
by fusing silica (in the form of sand) with sodium carbonate and either calcium 
carbonate or calcium oxide. More specialised glasses include pure fused silica and 
the heat-resistant borosilicate glasses (such as Pyrex) which are made with significant 
levels of boron oxide (B2O3). Lead(II) oxide is included in the formulation used to 
make decorative ‘lead crystal’ tableware as it gives glass attractive optical properties. 
All glasses also contain low levels of other elements owing to impurities introduced 
in the raw materials. Many also contain trace constituents that have been deliberately 
added, for example to impart colour, and/or that have contaminated the glass during 
manufacture or use.
 
Toughened glass (also called tempered glass) is that which has been heat-
treated to introduce internal stresses within its fabric. Such glass is used for the side 
and rear windows of cars. When broken, it does not tend to produce sharp shards 
but, instead, forms cuboid fragments. Laminated glass, used for windscreens and 
‘bullet proof’ glass, is made by sandwiching plastic film between sheets of ordinary 
glass. This material is much less likely to shatter completely when struck compared 
with glass without the integral plastic.
 
The breakage of glass frequently occurs during the commission of crimes, 
particularly those of theft from and of vehicles, burglary and crimes against the 
person. The types of glass involved are typically those used to make windows (including 
the side and rear windows of cars), containers, and the windscreens and headlamps 
of cars. Both the patterns of fragmentation and the glass fragments themselves are 
valuable sources of evidence.
3.2.1 Information from patterns of glass fragmentation
There are a number of scenarios in which it is of considerable evidential value to 
know from which side a particular sheet of glass was broken. For example, if a shot 
was fired through the window of a house, it might be of great importance to know 
whether the person firing the shot was standing inside or outside the house at the 
time. If the damage is due to a small, fast-moving object (such as a flying stone or, 
as in this case, a bullet), then the direction in which the projectile was travelling at 
the time of impact can be readily established. This is possible because such damage 
is characterised by a crater-shaped hole in the vicinity of the impact that is narrowest 
on the impact side of the glass.
 
However, not all breakages result in the formation of these symmetrical crater-
shaped holes. Indeed, as the velocity of the projectile decreases, the shape of the 
hole tends to become less regular and is ultimately no longer useful in establishing 
the side of impact.

GLASS  81

 
 
Fortunately, in the case of non-toughened glass, it is frequently possible to 
decipher the direction of impact, even in the absence of such crater-shaped holes. 
In order to appreciate how this can be done, it is necessary to understand the 
sequence of events that happens when a sheet of non-toughened glass is broken by 
an impact. During this process, the glass first bends. This bending action causes 
the glass on the side of the sheet opposite to that of the impact (i.e. the far side) to 
stretch and then to break. This produces a series of cracks, called radial fractures, 
to radiate across the sheet from the point of impact, thereby forming a number of 
V-shaped portions of glass. If the impact is sufficient to cause each of these portions 
of glass to bend far enough, the stretching effect that this induces on the near side 
of the glass will be enough to cause the glass to crack again. This time, however, the 
cracks occur across the V-shaped portions to produce ∇-shaped fragments. These 
secondary cracks – called concentric fractures – typically occur at approximately 
the same distance from the point of impact in each of the V-shaped portions and 
therefore form a rough circle about this point. If the impact causes sufficient distortion 
in the sheet of glass, then the point of impact will be encircled with another ring of 
concentric fractures, which is of larger diameter than the first.
 
The bending and subsequent fracture of a piece of glass frequently produce what 
are termed stress marks that are readily visible on its edge with the aid of low-
power magnification. As can be seen from Figure 3.4, these take the form of nested, 
J-shaped curves. One end of each of these is approximately at right angles to one 
side of the glass, while the other end of the same curve is asymptotic with the other 
side of the glass. Importantly, the curves form a right angle to the side of the glass 
that was stretched during the bending process and in which the crack started. This 
means that the right angle appears on radial cracks on the side opposite to that 
where the impact occurred. For identical reasons, concentric fractures exhibit 
stress marks that form right angles with the side of the sheet of glass on which the 
blow impacted. It is therefore possible to tell from which side a window has been 
broken, provided that it is glazed with non-toughened glass and that sufficient glass 
remains in the frame in order to establish the identity of at least one radial crack or 
one concentric crack.

If a sheet of glass is broken by two successive impacts but nonetheless remains 
intact, then it is often possible to deduce which impact occurred first. This is 
because those cracks produced by the second impact will terminate if they meet any 
of the fractures caused by the first impact. This termination will occur at the intersection 
of the fracture lines (Figure 3.5).
 
Finally, it is occasionally possible to fit together fragments of glass found at a 
scene with those in the possession of a suspect in much the same fashion as the 
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. For example, such a fit may occur between shards of 
headlamp glass recovered from the scene of a hit-and-run road traffic accident 
and those that remain in the front of a car driven by the suspect. Such evidence is 
extremely strong as it is believed that no two pieces of glass will shatter in exactly 
the same fashion.

with one of the cracks created by the impact on the right (R) (at point X). This clearly shows 
that impact R occurred before impact L. Note that the glass was not flexed between the time of 
impacts and the photograph being taken, thus ensuring that all cracks were due to the impacts

3.2.2 Information from glass fragments
If large fragments of glass are available, then features such as their colour, thickness 
and degree of curvature can be readily observed. These observations can provide 
both points of comparison between questioned and control samples and information 
that may lead to the classification of the glass and/or its intended use. For example, 
curved container glass may be distinguished from flat window glass.
 
When a piece of glass shatters, shards of it are distributed over a considerable 
area. This is particularly true of the smaller fragments. Clearly, someone breaking a 
windowpane with a blow from a heavy object will cause fragments to be propelled from 
the pane in the direction of the blow. However, tiny particles will also be ejected 
for up to 3 metres in the general direction from which the blow originated. It is 
almost inevitable that some of these back-scattered particles will become caught 
in the hair and/or clothing of the person breaking the pane. Indeed, somebody who 
smashed a window violently (e.g. with a hammer) would commonly have more than 
400 particles of glass on their person immediately after the event. However, most 
of these fragments, which typically have sub-millimetre dimensions, are lost fairly 
rapidly. Inevitably, the rate of loss will depend on the activity of the person and 
the properties of the garments that the person is wearing. However, under normal 
circumstances, the majority will be lost within 1 hour of the incident and virtually 
all will have gone after 24 hours. It is noteworthy that a typical person will have 
at most two fragments of glass found on the entirety of their clothing (excluding 
pockets). Therefore, if more than two fragments obtained from a suspect’s clothes 
are indistinguishable from a representative control sample taken from the 
broken pane of glass, this is likely to be considered as significant.
 
Tiny particles of glass may be collected from a suspect’s hair (by combing) and/or 
his or her clothing. The latter is best achieved by a combination of hand searching 
and vigorously shaking the garment over a clean sheet of paper or purpose-designed 
sampling funnel. Typically, pockets will also be brushed out but little significance 
is usually attributable to any glass found in them. This is because glass fragments 
can lodge in pockets for protracted lengths of time, which may well make it difficult 
to be certain whether the fragments concerned were present before the incident in 
question took place.
 
The particles obtained from the suspect can then be examined to reveal class 
characteristics that will help to identify the type of glass involved and that will provide 
points of comparison with control samples taken from the scene. Refractive index 
(Box 3.3) and density are two characteristics that are routinely determined. Both of 
these have the advantages that they are readily observed, discriminating and non-
destructive.
 
The density of a questioned glass fragment (which typically will be about 2.5 g 
cm–3) can be established by placing it in a medium made of two miscible liquids of 
different densities. For example, tribromomethane (CHBr3, density 2.89 g cm–3, also 
called bromoform) and bromobenzene (C6H5Br, density 1.50 g cm–3) may be used 
for this purpose. The density of the medium is then adjusted by the addition of one 
or other of the liquids until the fragment remains suspended in the medium, neither 
rising nor falling. At this point, the density of the medium is identical to that of 
the glass fragment. After the questioned fragment has been removed and kept safe 
for further testing, a fragment of control glass can be added to the medium. If it

floats or sinks then its density is not the same as that of the questioned fragment, 
thereby establishing that the two glasses do not have the same origin. Additionally, 
if a sample of the medium of known volume is weighed to find its mass, its density 
can be established (density = mass/volume), thereby establishing the density of the 
questioned glass. Note that the bromine-containing compounds referred to above 
are toxic. A relatively non-toxic polytungstate salt dissolved in water can be used as 
an alternative. Water can be added to this liquid to lower its density until it reaches 
that of the glass. After use, water can be evaporated from the solution, thereby 
increasing its density and making it ready for reuse.
 
The refractive index of a glass fragment is usually determined by immersing it 
in a thermally stable, transparent, colourless liquid that has a high boiling point 
– such as a silicone oil. The glass particle and the liquid that surrounds it are 
then illuminated with a monochromatic (i.e. single wavelength) light. The most 
commonly used light is sodium D radiation, which has a wavelength of 589 nm and 
is readily provided by a sodium lamp. The boundary between the fragment and the 
liquid is then observed through a microscope while they are slowly heated. As the 
temperature rises, the refractive index of the glass changes very little but that of the 
liquid drops at an appreciable rate. At a certain temperature, when the refractive 
indices of these two materials match, the boundary between them disappears. This 
event can be detected by eye or, in automated systems, electronically. The refractive 
index of the oil at the temperature of this event, and hence that of the glass, can 
then be found from a calibration graph prepared by conducting similar experiments 
using different reference glasses, each of known refractive index. Once established, 
the refractive indices of questioned and control fragments of glass can be compared. 
Any questioned fragments that do not have refractive indices that are sufficiently 
close to those of control fragments can then be eliminated as potential matches. 
Note that it is wise to compare the refractive indices of the questioned fragments 
with those of several control samples taken from the piece of glass that was broken 
at the crime scene. This is because there is a discernible variation in the refractive 
index of different fragments taken from the same piece of glass.
 
Refractive index measurements, when used in conjunction with the process of 
annealing, can also be used to readily distinguish between ordinary and toughened 
glass. To anneal a fragment of glass, it is heated to a high temperature for a prolonged 
period of time (typically 550  °C for between 1 and 24 hours) after which it is slowly 
cooled to room temperature. This process removes the stresses within the glass and 
is therefore accompanied by a change in its refractive index. As stress is deliberately 
introduced into toughened glass during its manufacture, a fragment of this type 
of material will undergo a significantly greater change in its refractive index on 
annealing than will ordinary glass.
 
There are other tests and processes that can be employed to provide both 
further class characteristics of questioned glass fragments and additional points 
of comparison between these fragments and control samples. Prominent among 
these is the establishment of the elemental composition of the glass. This is often 
routinely carried out on questioned and control samples that are indistinguishable 
on the basis of their refractive indices. It can be achieved by a number of techniques, 
including energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) coupled with scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) (Chapter 9, Box 9.7).

3.3 Soils
Soils are those materials that are naturally developed at the interface between the 
Earth’s crust and the atmosphere by the combined action of biological, chemical 
and physical processes. These materials are made up of naturally occurring mineral 
matter, organic matter, soil atmosphere and soil water, in various proportions. In 
the forensic context, a fifth component is usefully recognised, that of fragments of 
man-made materials such as concrete or brick.
 
Soils are of interest to the forensic scientist for a number of reasons. Under 
most moisture conditions, they are either friable or sticky. In either case, they are 
readily transferred from a scene to individuals and objects present at that scene and 
then possibly, by secondary transfer (Box 3.1), to other objects such as the inside of 
vehicles. Also, soil varies significantly from one location to the next and, at any one 
location, with depth. Note that a vertical section through a soil is called its profile. 
This normally consists of horizontal bands (termed soil horizons), each of which 
has different characteristics from its neighbours. There are many tests that can 
be used to provide class characteristics of a soil and thereby reveal this variation. 
Furthermore, many soils exhibit plastic properties over a wide range of moisture 
contents and may therefore retain the impression of objects pressed into them, 
such as footwear and tyres (Chapter 4, Sections 4.2 and 4.5 respectively).
 
The tests referred to in the previous paragraph reveal class characteristics that 
may be used to corroborate or refute other evidence. For example, the presence 
of soil on the seat of a suspect’s trousers that matches soil found at a crime scene 
may be found to be consistent with an eyewitness account of the commission of the 
crime. Furthermore, the evidence of an association between the suspect’s trousers 
and the scene would be even stronger if an imprint were found in the soil at the 
scene of textile fabric that matched that of the trousers.
 
The choice of tests employed in the characterisation of given samples of soil will 
depend on the circumstances of each individual case. However, these tests would 
normally include colour comparisons. When doing this, the samples to be compared 
must be viewed under identical conditions. In particular, it must be remembered that 
soils change colour with their moisture contents. Consequently, the samples should 
be dried (or moistened) to the same degree prior to comparison. Questioned samples 
are often presented to the laboratory in the form of smears, for example on a garment, 
for comparison with much larger control samples taken from the scene. Under these 
circumstances, a good colour comparison may be achieved if the scientist smears the 
control sample onto a clean portion of the same garment prior to examination.
 
Other tests that may usefully be carried out include:
 low-power light microscopy, which may reveal features of soil structure 
and the presence of unusual materials, whether manufactured or of plant or 
animal origin;
 high-power polarized-light microscopy to determine the identity of observable 
minerals (Box 3.3 gives further information on the optical properties of 
minerals), fragments of rock and possibly soil microstructure;

 differential thermal analysis (Box 3.7).
One of the main challenges in the interpretation of the significance of soil evidence 
is the difficulty in assessing the degree of natural variation in soil characteristics, 
both within a given location and between different locations. With this in mind, due 
regard must be given to the collection of control samples. In particular, multiple 
samples should be taken from and around the incident scene and any possible alibi 
locations. As soils vary in their characteristics with depth, care needs to be exercised 
to ensure that control samples are taken from each part of the profile that may have 
produced the questioned sample.
 
In addition, the interpretation of soil evidence that involves matching points of 
comparison between a questioned sample and a control sample should take into 
account the number of points used and the discriminating power of these points. 
In the main, as with any trace evidence, the confidence that the examiner has that 
the two samples may have a common source increases with the number of points 
of comparison that have been established and that produce a match between 
the samples. It should be noted that, with the current state of knowledge of soil 
distribution characteristics, it is only under very unusual circumstances that an 
examiner will be able to unequivocally individualise a given questioned soil to a 
particular location.
 
As well as providing associative evidence, soils can, under certain circumstances, 
provide investigative leads. In particular, the identification of the type of soil found 
on an object or a person may be useful in locating the area in which the object 
or person came into contact with that soil. Under these circumstances, maps that 
show the distribution of soil and/or rock types can be consulted to narrow down the 
search area.
During thermal analysis, a small sample (typically  
<200 mg) of the material to be characterised is subjected 
to a carefully controlled temperature programme (usually 
a steady increase in temperature) while one or more of 
the physical properties of the sample are monitored.
 
One such property that is commonly utilised in 
thermal analysis is mass, in which case the technique is 
known as thermogravimetry (TG). In another common 
technique of this type, called differential thermal 
analysis (DTA), the property that is monitored is the 
temperature difference between the sample and an 
inert reference material that is subjected to the same 
temperature programme as the sample. DTA detects 
changes undergone by the sample in which it gives 
out heat (termed exothermic events) and those in 
which it absorbs heat (known as endothermic events). 
For example, during the DTA of soils, the combustion 
of organic matter and the evaporation of water are, 
respectively, examples of exothermic and endothermic 
events that are commonly observed.
 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermal 
analytical technique that, like DTA, can detect both

3.4 Plant material
In common with the other types of trace evidence described elsewhere in this 
chapter, plant material can provide valuable information in the context of criminal 
investigations. However, it is only in recent years that forensic botany has become 
more widely recognised as a valuable tool in the investigative process. 
 
Plant material can be readily transferred on skin, clothes, shoes, tools, vehicles, 
etc. Such botanical trace evidence comes in many forms, for example:
 decaying vegetable matter embedded in soil or mud;
 fragmented plant material from stems, leaves, flowers, etc.
 diatoms (largely aquatic algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae);
 spores and pollen grains.
endothermic and exothermic events. During DSC analysis, 
both the sample and an inert reference material are 
subjected to the same temperature programme. During 
this process, the amount of energy that must be provided 
to each of the sample and the reference in order to 
maintain a zero temperature difference between them 
is measured. This is then displayed as a function of 
temperature. As can be seen from the figure shown 
below, this can be used, for example, to readily 
differentiate between butter and margarine.

The microscopic examination of such material can reveal class characteristics, which 
may allow the plant to be identified to genus level. Together with knowledge of the 
distribution, habitat and life cycle of the plant species in question, this information 
may prove valuable in providing investigative leads. For example, plant-derived material 
may be useful in:
 linking a suspect with a crime scene;
 helping to locate human remains (Box 3.8);
 pinpointing a murder scene when the body has been found elsewhere;
 providing evidence of the handling of illegal herbal drugs such as cannabis.
Within forensic botany, the specialty of forensic palynology is of particular note. 
Palynology is the scientific study of (primarily) pollen grains and plant spores – 
microscopic entities known collectively as palynomorphs. Pollen grains have a number 
of features that make them especially useful as botanical trace evidence. Firstly, they 
are immensely diverse in terms of their shape and intricate surface ornamentation. 
This facilitates their identification to genus level, a process that should involve 
comparison to actual reference collections, after the initial use of photographic 
illustrations. Secondly, they are resistant to chemical, biological and mechanical 
degradation, which means that they persist in the environment, sometimes for 
years. Thirdly, pollen grains, especially those of wind-pollinated (anemophilous) 
plants, are widespread in the environment and easily, and unnoticeably, transferred. 
Pollen from insect-pollinated (entomophilous) plants tends to be less ubiquitous 
but is nevertheless important because it may provide associative evidence in 
particular circumstances. For example, its presence on the skin or clothing of an 
individual points to direct contact with the plant species in question, or its immediate 
environment, and may help place that individual at the scene of a crime. 
 
Forensic palynology has been used in the investigation of a broad range of criminal 
cases including rape, murder, drug dealing, assault and genocide. The specific example 
given in Box 3.8 illustrates the part played by the forensic palynologist in a recent 
murder investigation in North Yorkshire, UK.

in connection with Joanne’s disappearance and charged 
with her murder on 21 February 2005. He admitted to 
Humberside Police that, after having an argument with 
Joanne about domestic chores, he had strangled her. 
He then wrapped her body in bin bags, placed it in the 
boot of her own car and drove off in search of a suitable

3.5 Paint
Paint is a liquid, manufactured product that when spread over rigid surfaces dries 
to form a thin, hard coating. It is applied to many man-made objects, including 
vehicles and various parts of buildings, in order to decorate and protect them. 
It is frequently applied in a series of layers, or coats. Each coat may consist of a 
paint that differs in its formulation from that of the underlying coat. There are 
many different formulations of paint made, reflecting differences in the technical, 
aesthetic and/or economic attributes that are desired in the product.
 
Hardened paint can be dislodged from the surface to which it is adhered by, for 
example, impact with another surface. This, coupled with the ubiquitous nature 
of paint in the human environment, means that chips and smears of paint are 
frequently encountered forms of trace physical evidence. This is particularly true in 
cases involving road traffic accidents or breaking-and-entering.
 
In cases where only questioned samples are available, such as might occur 
if the victim of a hit-and-run incident has been found but the culprit has yet to 
be apprehended, then paint can provide investigative leads. Clearly, under these 
 
The information given to the police by Paul Dyson 
about the isolated woodland in which he had hidden 
Joanne’s body was that there were ‘Christmas trees’ 
growing in the wood and a metal gate, and that the 
location was somewhere near York. However, despite 
extensive searching by hundreds of police officers, 
army personnel and volunteers, Joanne’s body remained 
undiscovered 36 days after she had disappeared. At 
this stage of the investigation, the ecologist, botanist 
and palynologist, Dr Patricia Wiltshire, was asked to 
assist in the search for Joanne’s remains.
 
After examining pertinent samples, including soil 
recovered from Joanne’s car and a number of articles 
owned by Paul Dyson, Dr Wiltshire was able to identify 
a complicated assemblage of different spore and pollen 
types. These included spores from ferns belonging to the 
genus Polypodium, and pollen from a number of trees 
including birch (Betula), hornbeam (Carpinus), spruce 
(Picea) and hemlock (Tsuga). Using her expertise in 
palynology, Patricia Wiltshire was able to interpret this 
evidence to provide important information about the 
woodland being sought. For example, the presence of 
spores of Polypodium was of great interest. While this 
fern was very common in the south and west, it was 
quite rare in the search area. However, it must either be 
currently living in the woodland or have grown there at 
some time in the past. In the latter case, the fern spores 
had been preserved in the acid soils of the woodland. 
Furthermore, the dominance of birch in the assemblage 
pointed to the body being located at the edge of a for-
estry plantation rather than deep in the middle (personal 
communication, Dr Patricia Wiltshire).
 
Using the information provided by Dr Wiltshire, 
the police were able to narrow down the search 
area very quickly. On 24 March 2005, police visited  
isolated woodland near Malton, North Yorkshire, and 
noted the presence of conifer trees behind a metal 
gate. A subsequent search of the woods led to the 
discovery of Joanne Nelson’s body, enclosed in bin 
liners and concealed with vegetation, 39 days after her  
disappearance. The path leading to her body and the 
body itself, covered in leaf litter and lying in a hollow, 
were all exactly as anticipated by Dr Wiltshire. 
 
On the first day of his murder trial at Kingston- 
upon-Hull Crown Court, Paul Dyson changed his plea 
to guilty. On 8 November 2005, he was convicted of 
the murder of Joanne Nelson and given a life sentence. 
Leading the investigation into Joanne Nelson’s 
disappearance and death, Detective Superintendent 
Ray Higgins of Humberside Police paid tribute to 
Patricia Wiltshire. Her expertise in the analysis of 
pollen and extensive knowledge of botany and ecology 
had led to the recovery of Joanne’s remains and helped 
bring Paul Dyson to justice.

circumstances, the appearance (especially the colour) of the paint involved will help 
the police in their search for the vehicle involved in the incident. In some cases, 
the comparison of the attributes of the sample with those of paint samples kept 
on record may lead to the identification of the possible make, model and/or an 
age range of the vehicle concerned. This approach played a significant role in the 
apprehension of Malcolm Fairley (Box 3.9).
In 1984, a series of violent sex attacks were carried 
out in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire by a hooded 
man armed with a sawn-off shotgun. Prior to this, the 
man, who became known as ‘The Fox’, had perpetrated a 
number of burglaries in the area. Through interviewing 
the victims of his crimes, the police were able to establish 
two important facts – that he spoke with a northern 
accent and that, as he wore his watch on his right wrist, 
he was apparently left-handed.
 
On 17 August 1984, The Fox struck again but this time 
in the village of Brampton, Yorkshire. In this incident, he 
broke into a house in the early hours of the morning, 
tied up the couple living there and, while the children 
slept in another room, raped the wife. Before leaving the 
scene, he removed traces of himself from his victim and 
cut out a section of the bottom sheet that was soiled 
with his semen. However, despite his attempts to remove 
any incriminating evidence from the scene itself, The Fox 
left behind a trail of forensic clues outside the house.
 
During their search of the surrounding area the next 
day, the police discovered several pieces of evidence 
including:
 a trail of footprints leading to a spot where a car 
had been hidden;
 tyre tracks;
 the square of semen-soaked bed linen;
 an improvised hood made from part of a pair of overalls;
 a sawn-off shotgun (hidden under a pile of leaves); and
 minute specks of yellow paint adhered to a tree branch, 
at a height of 45 inches (1.1 m) from the ground.
The tiny flakes of paint were subsequently identified in 
the laboratory as a car paint known as ‘Harvest Gold’ 
used only by the British Leyland Company. Further 
enquiries revealed that this particular paint had been 
used on a single model – the Austin Allegro – between 
May 1973 and August 1975. As a result of their 
investigations, the police knew several facts about 
the man dubbed The Fox, including his blood group, 
accent, build and shoe size. Now they knew the colour 
and model of the car he had driven that night and that 
its paintwork was likely to be scratched.
 
Further break-ins and assaults by The Fox continued, 
in both the north and south of England, while the 
police continued to eliminate individuals from their 
list of suspects. On 11 September 1984, two policemen 
were sent to an address in north London to check out 
one such suspect. On their approach, they saw a bright 
yellow Austin Allegro parked outside and a young man 
in the act of cleaning it. The officers noticed scratches 
to the car’s paintwork at a height of about 45 inches 
from the ground. When asked by one of the officers 
to put on a watch lying in the car, the man, whose 
name was Malcolm Fairley, complied. When he fastened 
the watch to his right wrist, he revealed that he, like 
The Fox, was left-handed. Furthermore, the officers 
discovered overalls whose material matched that used 
to make the improvised hood worn by The Fox in the 
Brampton incident. 
 
Malcolm Fairley was arrested. He was tried and 
found guilty of a number of charges, including counts 
of rape, indecent assault and burglary with intent to 
commit rape. On 26 February 1985, Malcolm Fairley, 
alias The Fox, was sentenced to six life sentences.

In the majority of cases, paint is used to provide associative evidence, either as 
well as or, more commonly, instead of investigative leads. In order to achieve this, 
both questioned and control samples must be available. (A paint chip found on the 
tip of a screwdriver suspected of being used to force a window open and a sample of 
paint taken from the window frame concerned would, respectively, constitute examples 
of questioned and control samples.) Under these circumstances, the comparison of 
the characteristics of the two samples of paint will normally allow the examiner to 
decide whether they are sufficiently similar to be consistent with their having the 
same source.
 
During the forensic examination of paint, physical and chemical attributes of the 
sample are ascertained to provide class characteristics and points of comparison. 
Many of these attributes, such as the paint’s colour, apparent layer thickness, surface 
texture and the appearance and pattern of occurrence of embedded particles, can 
be determined by microscopic examination using reflected light. Sometimes this 
examination is aided by the use of specialised light sources that provide specific colours 
of light or ultraviolet radiation.
 
Other attributes may be established by the use of:
 microspectrophotometry (Box 3.6), to provide a graph that is a quantitative 
expression of the colour of each layer evident in a given paint sample;
 pyrolysis gas chromatography (Chapter 11, Box 11.5), to reveal a pattern 
that reflects the chemical composition of the organic components of the 
paint;
 infrared or Raman spectroscopy, to provide graphs each made of peaks and 
troughs that not only can act as a pattern which may be used for comparative 
purposes but can also be interpreted to reveal information about the 
chemical composition of the paint (Box 3.10); 
The atoms that make up molecules vibrate and the 
energy with which a molecule vibrates is quantised. 
This means that the molecule can reside in one of 
many vibrational energy states but not in a vibrational 
energy state that is between two such states that are 
adjacent to one another. Bohr’s frequency condition 
was introduced in Box 3.6 in the context of electronic 
transitions. This is just as valid for transitions between 
the vibrational states of a molecule. According to 
this, a molecule can be promoted from a vibrational 
energy state E to a higher vibrational energy state E' by 
absorbing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency 
that accords with the following:
E' – E = ∆E = hν
in which h is Planck’s constant and ν is the frequency 
of the radiation.
 
One means of expressing the frequency of 
electromagnetic radiation is wavenumbers. The 
wavenumber of radiation is the number of wavelengths 
Box 3.10
Forensic techniques
Infrared and Raman spectroscopies
 92  TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART I: RECOVERABLE MATERIALS

 
that fit into a unit length. In the context of infrared and 
Raman spectroscopies, the unit length used is usually 
1 centimetre, in which case the units of wavenumbers 
are cm–1. If E and E' are vibrational energy levels, then 
the absorption of electromagnetic radiation will fall 
in the range 1 × 102 to 1 × 104 cm–1, which is within 
the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
This means that infrared (IR) spectroscopy can be used 
to monitor transitions between the vibrational energy 
states of a molecule. In this technique, the sample’s 
reflectance or transmittance of electromagnetic radiation 
in the infrared region is monitored as a function of 
wavenumber. In these plots, the absorption of radiation 
due to such a vibrational transition appears as a trough 
in an otherwise horizontal background. Most molecules 
exhibit many such troughs (confusingly referred to as 
peaks), as exemplified by the IR spectra of aspirin and 
phenobarbitone shown in Chapter 7, Figure 7.10.
 
It is also possible to monitor transitions between 
the vibrational energy levels of molecules by Raman 
spectroscopy. The physical basis of this is quite different 
from that of IR spectroscopy. Raman spectra originate 
from the inelastic scattering of light, a phenomenon that 
is also termed Raman scattering. Consider a molecule 
that is struck by light of energy hν0. It may elastically 
scatter this light, in which case the energy of the light 
will remain unchanged after the collision. Alternatively, 
the light may be Raman scattered in one of two ways. 
In one of these, the energy of the light becomes  
h(ν0 – νv), while in the other it becomes h(ν0 + νv). In 
both cases, νv is the frequency corresponding to the 
energy needed to excite the molecule from E to E'. Of the 
two types of Raman scattered light, that with an energy of  
h(ν0 – νv)  is more intense and is generally used for 
recording the spectrum. The spectrum is normally 
obtained using monochromatic laser light as the exciting 
radiation. As exemplified by the spectra of paint samples 
shown below, these spectra are usually shown as a plot 
of the variation in Raman intensity as a function of 
wavenumber, the inelastically scattered portion of the 
exciting radiation being designated as 0 cm–1. As can be 
seen from these examples, Raman spectra consist of a 
series of peaks on a more or less horizontal background.
 
Vibrational spectroscopy, whether IR or Raman, has a 
number of applications in the field of forensic science. 
The position of the troughs in IR spectra and the peaks 
in Raman spectra generally differ from one type of 
molecule to the next. This means, in principle at least,

 X-ray powder diffraction, to reveal the identity of the crystalline components 
of the paint and to provide a pattern that can be compared with the 
diffraction patterns of other paints (Box 3.11);
 elemental analysis by, for example, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) 
coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Chapter 9, Box 9.7). 
SEM-EDX is capable of differentiating between different layers of paint on the 
basis of their elemental compositions.
 
In many cases, the questioned sample of paint does not exhibit a layered structure, 
even if the source paint itself was layered. Samples like this may be in the form of a 
smear (such as may be formed during an exchange of paint between colliding vehicles) 
or a crushed chip (e.g. as may occur when a crowbar is used to break open a door). This 
is unfortunate because a layered structure, when evident, provides a valuable series of 
points of comparison between questioned and control samples.
 
Finally, on occasion, it is possible to match a questioned paint chip with a control 
sample in much the same way that a jigsaw piece is fitted into a partly finished jigsaw 
puzzle. When this occurs, it is frequently extremely strong evidence of an association 
between the chip and the control sample.
3.6 Others
Any material that may be transferred in small amounts from one object to another 
has the potential to be of trace evidential value. This includes the materials covered 
so far in this chapter, body fluids (Chapter 5), illegal drugs (Chapter 7), gunshot 
residues (Chapter 9), fire accelerants (Chapter 10), explosives (Chapter 11) and 
many others.
that either such spectrum can be used as a means of 
establishing the identity of an unknown pure compound 
by comparing its spectrum with those held on a database. 
For example, IR can often successfully identify the type 
of polymer from which an individual man-made fibre is 
made. This provides an important class characteristic 
of the fibre concerned. Indeed, the spectrum itself can 
be used as a class characteristic, allowing comparisons 
to be made between questioned and control samples, 
even if the chemical identity of the two samples is 
unknown, as in the case of the spectra of the two paints 
shown in the figure. Clearly, great care is required in 
the interpretation of such comparisons. For example, 
while there clearly is a difference between the spectra 
shown, it is possible that this is, to some degree at 
least, attributable to differences in any polishes applied 
to the two samples. Finally, both IR and Raman spectra 
contain information about the chemical composition of 
the sample. This is because specific functional groups 
absorb IR and/or produce Raman scattering in known 
regions of the spectrum. For example, the –O–H group 
found in alcohols typically absorbs IR in the region 3200 
to 3600 cm–1. Great care and considerable expertise are 
needed in making interpretations based on observations 
of this type. Finally, it is worth noting that it is often 
possible to obtain IR and/or Raman spectra from samples 
of microscopic dimensions and that both techniques are 
non-destructive. Both of these are valuable attributes 
within the forensic  context, where samples are often 
small and irreplaceable.

Materials that fall into this last category include oils, waxes (including polishes), 
inks (discussed in Chapter 8, Section 8.5, in the context of questioned documents), 
cosmetics, tobacco and other smoking materials, food and drink, and even macro-
invertebrate animals (e.g. insects, spiders and slugs). All of these are capable of 
revealing class characteristics that may provide investigative leads or, more commonly, 
associative evidence. The techniques used to reveal these characteristics will depend 
on the materials concerned and the circumstances of the individual case. However, 
those that may be usefully employed include:
 microscopic examination;
 spectroscopic methods such as ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (Box 3.6), 
infrared and Raman spectroscopy (Box 3.10), and mass spectrometry;
 chromatographic techniques such as thin-layer chromatography and gas 
chromatography (Chapter 11, Box 11.5);
 elemental analysis by such methods as EDX analysis coupled with SEM 
(Chapter 9, Box 9.7) and atomic absorption and emission spectroscopies 
(Chapter 7, Box 7.5);
 thermal analysis (Box 3.7);
 X-ray powder diffraction (Box 3.11).
In the main, trace evidence is useful in the corroboration or refutation of other 
evidence. However, there are situations in which it can provide extremely powerful 
evidence that is, arguably, individualising. As discussed in the sections on glass 
(Section 3.2), plant material (Section 3.4) and paint (Section 3.5), this can occur 
when jigsaw-puzzle-like fits can be produced between questioned and control samples. 
It also can occur when the trace evidence allows DNA profiling (Chapter 6) or when 
there are multiple forms of trace evidence that link together people and/or places. 
 
It is noteworthy that there are forms of trace evidence that, although not 
necessarily frequently encountered, are associated with particular types of crime. 
Examples of these include condom lubricants found in some rape cases and, in safe-
breaking cases, the specialised materials from which strongboxes are constructed.
Many materials of interest to forensic scientists, such 
as paint, many drugs and soil, contain components 
that are present as microscopic crystals. X-ray powder 
diffraction can be used to identify these components 
(i.e. provide qualitative information). In order to do 
this, at least a few milligrams of the sample must 
be available and each of the components concerned 
must represent at least a few per cent by mass of the 
total material present. X-ray powder diffraction can 
also be used to find out how much of each crystalline 
component is present. However, such quantitative 
work is not commonly carried out using this method.
Box 3.11

X-ray powder diffraction

OTHERS  95

 
 
For the vast majority of materials, sample preparation 
for qualitative analysis by this method simply requires 
the grinding of the sample to a fine powder, although 
even this simple step can be omitted in many cases. One 
of the advantages of X-ray powder diffraction is that the 
sample is not destroyed during analysis, although some 
materials will be damaged by the X-ray beam used and, 
clearly, the physical condition of the sample will be 
altered if it is ground.
 
X-ray powder diffraction is possible because each 
crystal is made up of a regular array of atoms and/or 
ions. In each case, it is convenient to think of this array 
as being constructed on the basis of a three-dimensional 
lattice made up of points. The points all lie on lattice 
planes. The perpendicular spacing between successive 
parallel planes (i.e. the d-spacing of that family of 
planes) is a characteristic of the crystal concerned. 
Any one crystal contains many such families of parallel 
planes, each with specific d-spacings. For example, 
crystals of the drug diamorphine (i.e. the main active 
component of heroin, see Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2) 
all have, among many others, families of planes with 
d-spacings of 5.281, 6.996, 6.567 and 5.078 Å (note that 
1 angstrom, symbol Å, equals 1 × 10–10 metre).

A schematic illustration showing an incident monochromatic X-ray beam (represented by AX and BY) of 
wave length λ impinging at an angle of θ with a family of lattice planes, three members of which are shown 
(labelled P, Q and R). These are perpendicular to the plane of the paper. In this case, the conditions of the Bragg 
equation are met as the distance GY plus YH is a whole number of wavelengths (1 in this case). This means 
that the emerging X-rays are in phase (i.e. the peaks and troughs along XD and YE are in step with each other). 
Therefore, the X-rays constructively interfere and emerge as what appears to be a reflected beam. The Bragg 
equation can be derived from this diagram. Note that the angles X^
GY and X^HY are both 90 °. It can be shown 
that the angles G^
XY and Y^
XH are both θ. Furthermore, they are both opposite the side of a right-angled triangle 
that is nλ/2 long (n=1 in this case but constructive interference will occur when n is any whole number from 1 to 
∞). Therefore, as the hypotenuse (XY) of each of these triangles equals d, in each case d sin θ = nλ/2, therefore 
nλ = 2d sin θ

During X-ray powder diffraction analysis, a fine 
beam of X-rays is shone on the sample. Families of 
lattice planes within the crystalline components of the 
sample behave as if they reflect this beam whenever 
the conditions of the Bragg equation are met. This 
equation takes the form:
nl = 2d sin θ
in which n is a whole number with a value between 
1 and ∞, l is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is as 
described earlier and θ is the angle of incidence and 
the angle of diffraction (see figure (a)).
 
In a typical X-ray powder diffraction experiment, as 
far as is practicable, the X-rays used all have the same 
wavelength. This wavelength is known and the angle 
2θ is measured for each reflection observed. From this 
information, the d-spacing of the family of planes 
that is responsible for a given reflection can readily be  
calculated on the assumption that n = 1, in which case d = 
l/2 sin θ. The relative intensity of each reflection is also 
measured. Comparison of the d-spacings of the families 
of planes that led to each of the observed reflections and 
the relative intensities of these reflections with those 
held on a database allows the identity of the crystalline 
component(s) of a sample to be identified. For example, 
as shown in figure (b), by use of this method, both the 
diamorphine and sucrose present in a batch of street 
heroin cut with cane sugar can be recognised.

3.7 A Bayesian approach to the
  
interpretation and evaluation of
  
recoverable trace evidence
Thus far, much of this chapter has been concerned with the nature and 
characterisation of recoverable trace evidence. In the context of a criminal 
court case, it is also necessary to establish whether any given item of such 
evidence supports either the prosecution’s or the defence’s contention and, if so, 
how strongly it does this. This section will explore how this may be achieved by 
the application of a Bayesian approach. Those readers who are not familiar with 
Bayesian methods of evidence interpretation and evaluation may find it helpful to 
read Section 13.6 of Chapter 13 before reading further here. 
 
By way of example, let us consider a fictitious assault in which a bottle has been 
broken over the head of a victim. Soon afterwards, a suspect was apprehended and 
his clothing was seized, from which glass was recovered. Control pieces of glass were 
also taken from the bottle used in the incident.
 
Common sense would suggest that this glass evidence has the potential to help 
the prosecution build its case. However, at this stage, it is not yet known whether 
it will do so. Also, it is not yet known what strength the evidence has. These are 
matters that can be settled by calculating the appropriate likelihood ratio (LR). As 
explained in Chapter 13, Section 13.6, this takes the form:
 
  
P(E|H1)
 
LR= ––––––––
 
  
P(E|H2) 
Eq 3.1
(labelled Eq 13.28 in Chapter 13)
where P stands for ‘the probability of’, E stands for ‘the evidence occurring’ and 
| stands for ‘given’, and H1 is the prosecution’s proposition and H2 is that of the 
defence.
 
Likelihood ratios have values between zero and infinity, with those larger than one 
supporting the proposition of the prosecution and those smaller than one supporting 
that of the defence. As can be seen from Table 13.5, the further the likelihood ratio is 
from one, the more strongly it supports the proposition that it favours.
 
As explained in Section 13.6.1 of Chapter 13, three levels of proposition may 
be recognised, namely source, activity and offence. Given the right amount of 
information, it is possible to assess the value of the above-mentioned glass evidence 
at each of these levels, the propositions being as follows: 
 At the source level, H1 is that the glass recovered from the suspect’s clothing 
came from the bottle and H2 is that the glass recovered from the suspect’s 
clothing came from some source other than the bottle.
 At the activity level, H1 is that the suspect broke the bottle and, for example, 
H2 may be that someone other than the suspect broke the bottle. The exact 
nature of H2 will depend on the suspect’s account of what he was doing 
during the incident. For example, if he were to claim to have been present at 
the incident but not involved in it, H2 would become that the suspect was a 
bystander when the bottle was broken.
 98  TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART I: RECOVERABLE MATERIALS

 
A BAYESIAN APPROACH  99
 At the offence level, H1 is that the suspect committed the crime and H2 is that 
he did not do so (the exact nature of the crime will depend on the charge).
Data may be discrete (e.g. the number of fibres) or continuous (e.g. the birefringence 
values of fibres) (see Section 13.1.1 of Chapter 13). The description that follows relates 
to the evaluation of likelihood ratios on the basis of evidence that is made up of:
 discrete data; and 
 continuous data that have been converted into discrete data by placing them 
into categories and counting the number of data points that fall in each 
category. 
Whenever continuous data are converted to discrete data, some information is lost. 
There are more sophisticated ways in which evidence that is made up of continuous 
data can be utilised in the evaluation of likelihood ratios. A discussion of these is 
beyond the scope of this book. However, this is a topic that is dealt with in depth by 
Aitken and Taroni (2004) (see the Further reading section at the end of this chapter 
for full bibliographic details).
 
At this point we will return to the example of the assault that is introduced above 
and examine the evaluation of the evidence at the activity level. The proposition 
(H1) that the suspect broke the bottle will be tested against the proposition (H2) 
that the suspect was not involved in the incident in any way.
 
Before we proceed, however, it is useful to define three terms: namely, explanation, 
circumstance and situation. As stated in Chapter 13, Section 13.6.1, in the context 
of evidence evaluation, we will take the word explanation to mean any statement that 
accounts for the existence of the evidence in the state in which it was discovered. 
For the purposes of this book and the arguments being made here, a circumstance 
is defined as an explanation that is based on explicit assumptions and, wherever it is 
useful to consider a circumstance to be made up of parts, each such part is known as 
a situation. In this section, whenever the words explanation, circumstance and situation 
are used to convey the meanings that are defined in this paragraph, they will appear 
in italics.
 
Let us examine the numerator of Equation 3.1 as it applies in this example. 
Consider the evidence that fragments of glass have been recovered from the suspect’s 
clothing. Let n equal the number of fragments that were recovered. Given that H1 is 
correct, each of these must have come either from the bottle or from somewhere else 
(known here as the background). There are therefore n + 1 explanations that can 
account for the recovery of these fragments. For example, if n = 3, there would be 
3 + 1 = 4 explanations. In no particular order, these are:
explanation 1: all three fragments came from the bottle;
explanation 2: two fragments came from the bottle and one from the background;
explanation 3: one fragment came from the bottle and two from the background;
explanation 4: all three fragments came from the background.
Numerator 
In a fraction it is 
that part which is 
above the line. For 
example, in x–y , x is 
the numerator.

 
 100  TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART I: RECOVERABLE MATERIALS
However, if it is assumed that these fragments constitute one group, all of which 
originated from a single source, then there are only two possible explanations,1 
referred to here as circumstances 1 and 2. These are:
circumstance 1: the fragments came from the bottle;
circumstance 2: the fragments came from the background.
The probabilities of these circumstances occurring can be calculated as follows:
Circumstance 1  Circumstance 1 may be considered to be made up of the following 
two situations:
situation 1a is that the suspect’s clothing was free of glass before the incident;
situation 1b is that glass was transferred to the assailant’s clothing when he broke 
the bottle on the victim’s head and of this transferred glass being subsequently 
found and recovered.
To calculate the probability of the evidence occurring given that circumstance 1 is 
correct, it is necessary to know:
 The probability (symbolised here as a0) that situation 1a actually occurred. 
Assuming that the suspect is a random member of the general population, 
this equals the proportion of the general public that have no glass on their 
clothing.
 The probability (t) that situation 1b actually occurred. This probability could 
be found from experiments:
– in which glass bottles are broken in a way that simulates what is alleged to 
have occurred during the crime; and 
– which account for what happened to the suspect’s clothing in the time 
between that event and the recovery of glass from that clothing.
Two events are statistically independent if the fact that one of them had 
occurred would not change the probability of the other occurring. The probability 
of two statistically independent events both occurring equals the product of the 
probabilities of each one of them occurring on their own. It is reasonable to 
assume that knowing whether situation 1a actually occurred has no impact on the 
probability of situation 1b occurring. The probability of one group of glass fragments 
being recovered from the suspect’s clothing given that circumstance 1 is correct is 
therefore a0t.
Circumstance 2 Circumstance 2 may be considered to be made up of the following 
two situations:
situation 2a is that, by chance alone, there was glass on the suspect’s clothing at 
the time at which it was seized and that this glass would be subsequently found 
and recovered;
Statistical 
independence 
Two events 
are statistically 
independent if the 
fact that one of 
them had occurred 
would not change 
the probability of the 
other occurring. 
1 Clearly, the value that is calculated for the likelihood ratio will be altered if this assumption is 
wrong. The implications of this are discussed in the second paragraph after Equation 3.3. 

 
A BAYESIAN APPROACH  101
situation 2b is that no glass was transferred to the assailant’s clothing when he 
broke the bottle on the victim’s head.
Let a be the probability of situation 2a occurring. Assuming that the suspect is a 
random member of the general population, this equals the proportion of the general 
public that have recoverable glass on their clothing at any given time. Let t0 be the 
probability of situation 2b occurring. As with t, this probability can be found from 
suitable crime scene reconstruction experiments.
 
The two situations that make up circumstance 2 may be assumed to be 
statistically independent. Therefore, the probability of the evidence occurring given 
that circumstance 2 is correct is at0.
 
Two scenarios are said to be mutually exclusive if, while either may be true, 
they cannot both be simultaneously true. The probability of either one or other of 
such a scenario being true is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice that 
circumstances 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive, therefore:
 
P(E|H1) = a0t + at0 
Eq 3.2
Now consideration will be given to the denominator of Equation 3.1 in the context 
of this example. The evidence is as in the numerator. However, there is only one 
circumstance (circumstance 3) required given that H2 is correct. This is that the 
glass recovered from the suspect’s clothes had not been transferred there during 
the commission of the crime but was from the background. Thus, the probability of 
this occurring is a.
 
Therefore:
 
 
  P(E|H1)    a0t + at0     a0t
 
LR = ––––––––– = –––––––––– = ––––– + t0
 
  
 P(E|H2 )   
 a 
 
 a  
 
Eq 3.3
As shown in Section 13.6 of Chapter 13, the size of this likelihood ratio provides 
a direct evaluation of whether the evidence supports the proposition of the 
prosecution or that of the defence and, furthermore, the strength of that support.
 
If the assumption that all of the fragments of glass were a single group that came 
from one source is wrong, this would change Equation 3.2, making it more complex, 
and increase the value of P(E|H1). This, in turn, would increase the likelihood ratio. 
This assumption can therefore be seen as being conservative as it gives lower support 
to the prosecution’s proposition than would occur if it were not made.
 
While the argument presented above relates to a specific fictitious case, it can be 
seen that its principles are equally applicable to any form of trace evidence that is 
transferred and subsequently recovered and so it is a general method.
 
For many types of trace evidence, it is possible to count the number of particles 
that have been transferred, found and recovered. For example, the number of foreign 
yellow acrylic fibres with birefringence values between 0.001 and 0.004 that have been 
recovered from a victim’s shirt could be counted. This type of data can also be used 
when calculating a likelihood ratio. To see how this may be done, let us return to the 
fictitious incident referred to earlier in this section.
 
As before, let n represent the number of individual fragments of glass that were 
found and recovered from the suspect’s clothes and assume that these are all from 
Denominator 
In a fraction it is 
that part which is 
below the line.  For 
example, in x–y , y is 
the denominator.

 
 102  TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART I: RECOVERABLE MATERIALS
the same source. If they were counted, this new information would, in effect, alter t 
and a as defined above. With this in mind, let us define two new variables, tn and an:
 tn is the probability of glass fragments being transferred to the assailant’s 
clothing if he broke the bottle on the victim’s head and that n of these 
fragments would subsequently be found and recovered;
 an is the probability that, by chance alone, there were fragments of glass on 
the suspect’s clothing at the time at which it was seized and that n of these 
fragments would be subsequently found and recovered.
Taking this information into account, the likelihood ratio becomes:
 
 P(E|H1)   a0tn + ant0 
  a0tn
 
LR = ––––––––– = –––––––––––– = ––––– + t0
 
 P(E|H2)  
 an 
  an  
 
Eq 3.4
As described elsewhere in this chapter, it is common for trace evidence to be 
characterised. In the case of glass, for example, its colour, refractive index, etc. may 
be determined. Equations 3.3 and 3.4, and their analogues for other evidence types, 
can be modified to take this into account. 
 
To illustrate how this may be done, let us return to the fictitious incident that is 
referred to above. However, let us suppose that the refractive indices of the glass of 
the bottle and that recovered from the suspect’s clothing were established and found 
to be indistinguishable. Refractive index measurements are examples of continuous 
data. This finding effectively categorises all glass refractive index measurements into 
two classes. These are those measurements that are indistinguishable from those 
made on the glass of the bottle and those which are not.
 
Let us assume that the glass recovered from the suspect’s clothing came from a 
single source. Now, it is possible to establish:
1. The probability (βb) of the refractive index evidence occurring given that the 
glass recovered from the suspect’s clothing came from the bottle used in the 
incident.
2. The probability (β) of the refractive index evidence occurring given that the 
glass recovered from the suspect’s clothing came from some other source.
In order to find 2, the distribution of refractive indices of glass found on the clothes 
of the general public must be known.
 
Now:
circumstance 1 becomes: the fragments from the suspect’s clothes came from 
the bottle and were found to be indistinguishable from the bottle on the basis 
of refractive index measurements; 
circumstances 2 and 3 each become: the fragments from the suspect’s clothes 
came from the background and were found to be indistinguishable from the 
bottle on the basis of refractive index measurements.

 
A BAYESIAN APPROACH  103
The probability of the evidence occurring given that:
 circumstance 1 is correct is now a0tβb or a0tn βb;
 circumstance 2 is correct is now at0 β or ant0 β;
 circumstance 3 is correct is now aβ or an β.
The likelihood ratio given in Equation 3.3 becomes:
 
 
  P(E|H1)  a0t βb + at0 β

Eq 3.6
Bayesian methods have been devised in the context of crimes in which glass has been 
broken that allow the evaluation of the strength of evidence provided by two or more 
groups of glass fragments found on a suspect’s clothing. Space does not permit these 
methods to be described here but detailed information on this topic is available from 
Aitken and Taroni (2004), and Curran, Hicks and Buckleton (2000) (see the Further 
reading section at the end of this chapter for full bibliographic details).
 
Note that it will not normally be possible to calculate a given likelihood ratio with 
complete accuracy. This is in part because of imponderables that may have a bearing 
on the values of the probability data on which the likelihood ratio is based. For 
example, in the fictitious case outlined above, any reconstructions that were carried 
out to obtain transfer probability data would be based on what is known about the 
alleged incident. As this knowledge is incomplete, it is unlikely that the data generated 
will be fully accurate. It is important to realise that the limitations outlined in this 
paragraph do not invalidate the use of likelihood ratios. However, when they apply, 
the likelihood ratios produced will be estimates. Also, as described in the following 
paragraphs, such limitations may impact on the nature of the propositions that the 
forensic scientist is able to address.
 
The example described above has illustrated how evidence can be used to test 
activity-level propositions via the evaluation of a likelihood ratio. However, this 
process clearly requires information about the case. For example, the accurate 
evaluation of t that features in Equations 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5, and that of tn that 
occurs in Equations 3.4 and 3.6, requires information about what happened to 
the suspect’s clothing between the time of the incident and the recovery of glass 
from it. Similarly, evaluation of a (part of Equations 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5) or an (seen 
in Equations 3.4 and 3.6) would be based on an assumption that the suspect is 
a random member of the population. This assumption is founded in part on the 
assertion made by the defence that the suspect was not involved in the incident 
in any way. This assertion is presumably derived from the suspect’s description of 
events at the time of the incident.
 
There may well be instances in which a forensic scientist is left unaware of key 
information regarding a particular case. For example, the time of the incident may be 
unknown, or the suspect may refuse to comment on his or her level of involvement in 
the incident or actions between it and the time of his or her arrest. Faced with such 

 
 104  TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART I: RECOVERABLE MATERIALS
restrictions, the forensic scientist may well have insufficient information to assess 
a likelihood ratio based on activity-level propositions. Instead, the forensic scientist 
would base his or her assessment on source-level propositions.
 
Returning to the fictitious incident involving the glass bottle, the only probabilities 
that are referred to above that are not conditional on information about what may 
have occurred during the event are βb and β. These can be used to assess a source-level 
likelihood ratio, thus:
 
 
 P(E|H1)    βb
 
LR = –––––––––  = ––
 
 
 P(E|H2)     β 
 
 
Eq 3.7
in which:
E is that the refractive indices of the glass of the bottle and that found on the 
suspect’s clothing were indistinguishable;
H1 is that the glass recovered from the suspect’s clothing came from the bottle 
used in the incident; and 
H2 is that the glass recovered from the suspect’s clothing came from some 
other source.
Given the correct information, it is possible to construct a likelihood ratio to 
test offence-level propositions (for information on this, see Aitken and Taroni 
(2004) (bibliographic details are given in the Further reading section at the end 
of this chapter). However, as noted in Section 13.6.1 in Chapter 13, this requires 
knowledge that, arguably, is outside the field of expertise of the forensic scientist.
 
It is the work of lawyers to demonstrate, as far as they are able, how any expert 
witness opinion that is based on activity- or source-level propositions relates to the 
ultimate question of the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the Crown Court, it is 
the duty of the jury, guided by the judge, to make their decision about this question 
based on the entirety of the evidence that is placed before them. In the Magistrates’ 
Court, this task is performed by the lay magistrates. See Chapter 14, Section 14.1, 
for more information on the criminal court system in England and Wales.
 
The last of the problems at the end of Chapter 13 is designed to test your 
understanding of key aspects of this section on the interpretation and evaluation 
of recoverable trace evidence. An outline answer to this problem is provided on the 
website that accompanies this book. Further information on likelihood ratios and 
the Bayesian approach is provided in Chapter 13, Section 13.6. 
 
Finally, it is important to realise that while the Bayesian approach is based on 
numbers and calculations, it involves a significant element of subjectivity on the 
part of the expert. This is partly because of the imponderables that are referred to 
earlier in this section. However, it is also due to the fact that, in most cases, for a 
given type of physical evidence, the available database(s) are relatively small and/or 
not kept sufficiently up to date. This means that any probabilities that are based on 
such databases are estimates, as are any likelihood ratios that are based on them. 
Arguably, the value of the Bayesian approach to evidence evaluation is that it:
 allows the assumptions that need to be made during such evaluation to be 
explicitly stated;

 
A BAYESIAN APPROACH  105
 produces a means of assessing the strength of evidence that can be used to 
confirm opinion that is born of expert experience; and 
 provides a means (such as shown in Table 13.5, in Chapter 13) by which such 
opinion can be presented in a standardised fashion.
Problems
1. Why is it that some forms of trace recoverable evidence provide more powerful 
evidence than other forms?
2. Consider a case in which the body of a strangled woman is found by the side 
of a road. The woman’s husband is believed to have committed the murder, 
in their marital home, before transporting the body in the family car to the 
place where it was found. Inspection of the body reveals a number of fibres 
adhering to it that match those of the carpet that lines the boot of the car in 
question. It was noted that some of these fibres were found to be adhering to 
a small trickle of blood that emanated from the victim’s mouth when she was 
strangled. Is this detail of evidential value? Justify your answer.
3. Dusting a surface for fingerprints will almost certainly dislodge and lose any 
evidentially valuable fibres present. Similarly, using a tape lift to recover 
the fibres will probably destroy the fingerprints. Bearing this in mind, if, 
as a crime scene examiner, you were faced with a surface that might reveal 
both fingerprint and fibre evidence, what would you do? In answering this 
question, take time to weigh up the relative evidential value of fingerprints 
(Chapter 4, Section 4.1) and fibres (Section 3.1).
 Trace materials that may be recovered from an incident 
scene, individuals believed to be associated with that 
scene and/or the belongings of those individuals can be of 
significant evidential value. These materials may include 
hairs and other fibres, glass, soils, vegetable matter, paint 
and many other substances.
 Each of these materials can be characterised by the methods 
referred to in this chapter to reveal class characteristics. 
These characteristics can be used to provide investigative 
leads. They can also provide points of comparison between 
questioned samples taken from an incident scene and 
control samples taken from an individual or his or her 
belongings. Comparisons based on these points provide 
associative evidence that may enable the corroboration or 
refutation of incident scenarios suggested by other pieces 
of evidence.
 In the main, the examination of trace recoverable evidence 
enables the type of object to be identified. For example, the 
examination of a sample of hair may well allow the species 
from which it originated to be established. Furthermore, 
the comparison of two samples of trace recoverable  
evidence will frequently allow the examiner to state 
whether their similarities are sufficient to be consistent 
with them having a common origin.
 Under certain circumstances, trace recoverable evidence 
can also lead to the identification of the source of 
that evidence (i.e. it can individualise). This can occur 
when there is a jigsaw-puzzle-type physical fit between 
questioned and control samples, where a DNA profile 
match is possible (Chapter 6), or in cases where there are 
multiple types of matching recoverable trace evidence 
linking an individual to a place or to another individual.
 As with other forms of evidence, trace recoverable evidence 
may assist the prosecution to build its case. Alternatively, 
such evidence may assist the defence. The Bayesian approach 
allows the evaluation of whether, on balance, a given piece 
of evidence supports the proposition of the prosecution 
or that of the defence. It does this via the calculation of 
a likelihood ratio, the size of which indicates the strength 
of the evidence. Furthermore, this approach provides a 
framework for the clear exposition of the assumptions that 
are made during the evaluation of the evidence.

Introduction 
This chapter examines the valuable evidence that can be provided by the different 
types of marks and impressions left at a crime scene. Of these, fingerprints1 may 
be considered to be the most important type as they are unique to the individual 
and can therefore be used as a means of personal identification. Furthermore, they 
are frequently present at crime scenes and typically form an essential part of the 
evidential material gathered.
1 In this book, the term ‘fingerprint’ is used for both those found at the crime scene and those 
taken from an individual under controlled circumstances. It should be noted, however, that 
within the field a distinction is sometimes made between the former (finger marks) and the 
latter (fingerprints).

 
 
Other marks and impressions that may be found at an incident scene include 
footwear impressions, bite marks, tool marks and tyre marks. In all four of these 
types, it may be possible to match scene impressions with suspect items (or, in the 
case of bite marks, directly with suspect individuals) through the creation of test 
impressions. Textile products are another means by which marks and impressions 
may be left at an incident scene, as exemplified by the imprints made by gloved 
hands. Moreover, they may themselves show signs of damage, which can be used, in 
some cases, to identify the type(s) of implement involved in the incident. Note that 
for information about impressions made by indented writing, the reader is referred 
to Chapter 8, Section 8.7.6.
4.1 Fingerprints
4.1.1   The basis of fingerprints as a means of 
identification
In humans, the surface of the palms of the hands and the fingers, and the soles 
of the feet and the toes, are covered with a special type of thickened skin known 
as friction ridge skin. This has evolved in primates to provide a gripping surface 
and also, through the greater concentration of nerve endings present, to facilitate 
an enhanced sense of touch. As the name suggests, friction ridge skin has a 
ridged appearance, rather like that of a ploughed field in miniature, with furrows 
separating the individual ridges. However, these ridges are not arranged in straight 
lines but form complex patterns on the surface of the skin. Contact between an 
area of friction ridge skin and another surface may result in the creation of a 
characteristic print or impression on that surface (Section 4.1.4). Furthermore, a 
set of prints, for example of the fingers and thumbs, can be reproduced deliberately 
using inks or similar substances to produce a permanent record. Such prints can be 
used as a means of personal identification that is based on the following premises:
n The fingerprints of an individual stay unchanged throughout life. The friction 
ridge pattern of an individual is fully formed in the foetus by about 24 weeks 
after conception. The exact arrangement of the ridges is determined by the 
dermal papillae, a layer of cells that separates the outer layer of skin (the 
epidermis) from the underlying dermis. This pattern endures throughout 
life, although it may be marred, for example, by deep scarring. Moreover, 
it persists for some time after death and may therefore prove useful in 
post-mortem identification (Chapter 12, Section 12.5.1).
n No two fingerprints are identical. Support for this principle came first from 
Sir Francis Galton’s theoretical calculations presented in his landmark 
publication, Finger prints, in 1892. In this, he demonstrated that the odds 
against two individual fingerprints being exactly the same was 64 billion 
to 1. Perhaps even more compelling is the actual evidence accrued from 
fingerprinting individuals over the past 100 years. Of the many millions 
classified to date, no two fingerprints have yet been found to be the same, 
even those of identical twins.

4.1.2  The classification of fingerprints 
The presence of recognisable ridge pattern types has allowed fingerprints to be 
systematically classified. The fingerprint classification system adopted in most 
English-speaking countries (including England and Wales from 1901) was the Henry 
System. This 10-print classification system was developed by Sir Edward Richard 
Henry (1850–1931), based on the observations made by Sir Francis Galton (1822–
1911) of three basic types of fingerprint patterns – loops, arches and whorls. Each 
of these three types, and their subtypes, are described below and illustrated in 
Figures 4.1–4.3.

classification
Note that the ulnar loop pattern (not illustrated) differs from the radial loop pattern in only 
one respect: the loop opens in the direction of the little finger and not in the direction of  
the thumb
FINGERPRINTS n 109

 
Loops 
Approximately 60 per cent of all fingerprints fall into the loop pattern category, 
making it the commonest of the three basic types. In this pattern, at least one ridge 
must enter from one side, curve around and then exit at the same side (Figure 4.1). 
Two subtypes are recognised – the radial loop and the ulnar loop – depending on the 
direction of flow of the ridges. In simple terms, if the loop opens in the direction of 
the thumb (i.e. towards the radial bone of the forearm), it is termed a radial loop 
and if it opens in the direction of the little finger (i.e. towards the ulnar bone of the 
forearm) it is known as an ulnar loop.
 
To be classified as a true loop pattern, all of the four features listed below, and 
illustrated in Figure 4.1, must be present:
n a single delta (an area where the ridges diverge);
n a core (the pattern’s centre);
n a minimum of one recurving ridge that flows between the delta and the core;
n a minimum ridge count of one.
Arches 
The arch pattern accounts for about 5 per cent of all fingerprint patterns. Two subtypes 
are recognised: the plain arch and the tented arch (Figure 4.2). In the plain arch, which 
is the simplest fingerprint pattern of all, the friction ridges flow from one side to the 
other rising smoothly in the centre, like a wave. In contrast, the tented arch, which 
may be considered as an intermediate between an arch and a loop, usually has either a 
central upthrusting ridge or ridges meeting at an angle of 90° or less at the apex of the 
arch. However, as may be expected, there are also tented arches that show some, but 
not all, of the four characteristics of the loop pattern.
Whorls
The whorl pattern accounts for about 35 per cent of all fingerprint patterns. The 
situation regarding the classification of whorl patterns based on the Henry System 
is complicated because different ways of subdividing whorl patterns are used. One 
categorisation that is in common usage, and is recognised by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), places whorls into the following four types – plain, central pocket 
loop, double loop and accidental. The simplest of these is the plain whorl, which has 
two deltas and a minimum of one ridge that completely encircles the core, describing 
the shape of a circle, oval or spiral in so doing (Figure 4.3a). If an imaginary line 
connecting the two deltas encounters at least one ridge circling the core, then the 
pattern belongs to the plain whorl subtype. However, if it does not, the pattern is 
distinguished as a central pocket loop whorl (Figure 4.3b). A more complicated whorl 
pattern is the double loop whorl, which consists of two loop patterns in combination 
(Figure 4.3c). (This third type is known in the UK as the twinned loop.) The fourth 
and final subtype, the accidental whorl, is applied to fingerprints either that consist of 
a combination of two or more pattern types (with the exception of the plain arch) or 
whose pattern does not fit into any of the recognised categories previously described.

4.1.3  The comparison and identification of fingerprints
Within each police force in England and Wales, the comparison and identification 
of fingerprints are carried out by highly trained fingerprint experts within the 
Fingerprint Bureau (Chapter 2, Box 2.1). In the past, fingerprint information was 
held on a series of card indices that had to be filed, searched and retrieved by 
hand – a long and laborious process. Each individual police force maintained its 
own locally based fingerprint collection, while a ‘national collection’ was kept at 
New Scotland Yard for further reference. However, this situation was revolutionised 
by the development of the Automated Fingerprint Recognition (AFR) system – a

computerised system introduced in 1992 that was taken up by most (but not all) of 
the forces in England and Wales. This AFR technology was then incorporated into 
its successor, the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS), 
which, by 2001, had become available to all police forces in England and Wales. 
 
The situation in Scotland developed along similar lines, with the AFR system 
coming into use in the early 1990s. However, the system in Scotland was independent 
from that of England and Wales, with the Scottish collection of fingerprint images 
stored on a database maintained by the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) 
Forensic Services – Fingerprints (Glasgow).
 
In April 2005, a new system was introduced called IDENT1 – the national 
database for fingerprints, palm prints and crime scene marks – developed by 
Northrop Grumman, a US defence company (under contract until 2013). This 
computer database replaced NAFIS in England and Wales and the Scottish AFR 
system to provide a single system for the identification of fingerprints and palm 
prints1 accessible to the police forces of all three countries. By December 2006, 
the fingerprint and palm print data from the Scottish AFR system were transferred 
to IDENT1, thus completing the amalgamation. Five years later (April 2010), the 
IDENT1 database holds sets of (10-print) fingerprints for 8.3 million individuals.
 
The national fingerprint collection held on IDENT1 is the only definitive database 
that allows the identification of individuals. Every person who has been arrested and 
charged, reported or summonsed for any recordable offence has his or her fingerprints 
taken. Originally this was done in the custody suite of a police station by taking rolled 
impressions using ink under controlled conditions, but this has been increasingly 
replaced by the use of electronic devices, primarily Livescan terminals, connected to 
the database. Moreover, portable electronic devices are being introduced for use in 
the field. In this situation, the individual’s fingerprints are scanned electronically by 
a hand-held device and the captured images transmitted to the IDENT1 system. The 
advantage of this system is that it allows police officers on patrol to check, within a 
matter of minutes, the identity of an individual suspected of committing an offence. 
If not already on file to confirm the identity of the individual concerned, these 
fingerprints are added to the national database. 
 
In the case of adults, those individuals cautioned for or convicted of any recordable 
offence will have their fingerprints kept on the IDENT1 database indefinitely. However, 
under the Crime and Security Act (2010), the fingerprint records of adults arrested 
but not cautioned or convicted must be destroyed after 6 years. Persons who have 
a legitimate reason to be at a particular crime scene (such as a householder in the 
case of a domestic burglary) may well provide the police with their fingerprints for 
elimination purposes. Fingerprints taken in these circumstances are not added to the 
national fingerprint database.
 
With regard to fingerprints, the IDENT1 system can be used to carry out a 
number of different types of searches. The first of these, already mentioned in the 
preceding paragraph, is the establishment of the identity of a suspect by comparing 
a set of fingerprints taken from the individual with any held for that person on the 
database. Another main type of search involves the comparison of fingerprints left 
at a crime scene with those held on IDENT1. Fingerprints recovered from a crime 
scene are scanned into IDENT1.2 In each case, the fingerprint expert marks up 
1 Unlike previous versions, IDENT1 can process palm prints, as well as fingerprints.

development techniques, are usually colour-inverted so that ridges appear black on a white 
background before identification is carried out.

the individual characteristics of the scene fingerprint and the computer searches 
through the stored images held on the database for likely matches. As a result of 
this process, the IDENT1 computer system generates a selection of best matches, 
providing the fingerprint expert with a list of possible suspects. However, it should 
be emphasised that the decision over the identification, if any, of a scene print rests 
with the fingerprint experts.
 
In making a comparison between a scene print and one held on file, the 
fingerprint expert will look at the following features (whenever these are identifiable 
in the scene print).
 
Firstly, class characteristics:
n the overall pattern of the fingerprint (i.e. loop, arch or whorl).
Moving on to individual characteristics, primarily:
n the type and location of ridge characteristics, especially the ridge endings 
and bifurcations (where a ridge branches into two) (Figure 4.4).

May be followed (and supported) by:
n the path of any accident features, for example flexion creases (found between 
the movable parts of the hand) and scars;
n the relative location of pores (known as poroscopy);
n the fine detail of shapes appearing on the ridges themselves (know as 
edgeoscopy).
If there are enough ridge characteristics in the same positions on both the scene 
print and that held on file, the fingerprint expert can make an identification. Until 
recently, in the UK, the minimum number of matching characteristics required for a 
full identification was 16. However, today, there is no minimum quantitative standard 
and the decision over identification rests with the fingerprint expert concerned, whose 
opinion must then be validated by two other fingerprint officers.
4.1.4  The different types of fingerprints
Fingerprints recovered at an incident scene can usually be placed into one of the 
three categories outlined below, although sometimes the distinction is a fine one. 
As such fingerprints are normally transient in nature, categorisation into type 
enables them to be quickly and appropriately processed.
Latent fingerprints
Latent fingerprints cannot be seen with the naked eye. They consist mainly of 
perspiration exuded from the sweat pores, which occur in single rows along the 
ridges of the friction ridge skin. Perspiration is composed mainly of water (~95 per 
cent) with the remaining 5 per cent made up of other substances such as salt and 
amino acids. Some body oil or grease may also be present in latent fingerprints, 
transferred to the fingertips by touching other parts of the body such as the 
hair. Latent prints require visualisation before identification (Section 4.1.5). The 
chemicals used in their development react with the different chemicals present 
in the perspiration. In some instances, negative latent fingerprints may be formed 
when an individual touches a surface that is either covered in dust, for example, or 
sticky for some reason.
Visible fingerprints
As the name suggests, this type of fingerprint contrasts well with its substrate and 
is therefore easily visible to the naked eye. Visible fingerprints are formed when 
an appropriate substance is transferred by the fingertips onto a suitable surface. 
Examples of such materials are paint, blood, grease, ink, faeces, cosmetic materials 
and soot. It should be noted that the nature of the surface upon which a print is 
deposited might be the only factor that determines whether a print is classified as 
latent or visible.

FINGERPRINTS n 115

 
Plastic fingerprints
The third type of fingerprint does not involve the deposition of substances, visible 
or otherwise, onto a surface but is formed when a negative ridge impression is made 
into some suitably soft material. These are known as plastic fingerprints and may 
be found, for example, in fresh paint, clay, soap, candle wax, chocolate or putty. 
Being three dimensional, they are often reasonably visible to the naked eye. 
4.1.5  The development of latent fingerprints
Latent fingerprints may be defined as fingerprints that are invisible to the naked eye. 
In contrast to visible prints and plastic impressions (Section 4.1.4), latent prints 
need to be developed in order to make them visible. In the early years of fingerprint 
collection, the availability of visualisation techniques was restricted largely to the 
application of various powders. However, over recent years, this situation has changed 
dramatically with many more new techniques (many of them chemical in nature), 
together with variations or refinements of existing techniques, becoming available. A 
brief description of the main techniques is given below.
Acid black 1, acid violet 17 and acid yellow 7
The reagents acid black 1, acid violet 17 and acid yellow 7 are used in the 
development of fingerprints contaminated with blood. The first two can be used 
on any type of surface, while the effective use of acid yellow 7 is confined to the 
enhancement of lightly contaminated fingerprints on non-porous surfaces. 
These blood reagents must be used as part of the sequential processing of 
blood-contaminated latent fingerprints (see Figure 4.6), as they are not effective in 
developing those parts of a latent fingerprint in which only the usual constituents of 
sweat are present. 
 
In the presence of proteins from blood or other body fluids, acid black 1, acid violet 
17 and acid yellow 7 produce blue-black, vivid violet and yellow fluorescent images 
respectively. It should be noted that the blood reagent acid violet 17, but not acid 
black 1, may be used after the application of acid yellow 7 on non-porous surfaces. 
One or more of these blood reagents can be used for fingerprint enhancement at 
crime scenes if necessary (i.e. in those situations where it is not possible to send the 
evidential item or structure to the laboratory).
Fluorescence examination: the use of lasers and  
high-intensity light sources 
Latent fingerprints may occasionally be observed to fluoresce when viewed, with 
appropriate viewing filters, under a laser or high-intensity light source. This inherent 
fluorescence is usually due to the presence of contaminants (such as grease, urine 
or coffee) in the sweat that forms the latent print (Section 4.1.4). Furthermore, 
latent fingerprints can be made to fluoresce by subjecting them to certain chemical 
treatments, for example spraying with zinc chloride solution after ninhydrin treatment 
and then viewing the prints under laser light. In some cases, it may be possible to 
make the background material fluoresce, thus showing up the fingerprint as a darker 
image. Iron arc lasers are still widely utilised for fingerprint visualisation but in more 
recent years a number of non-laser high-intensity light sources have been developed. 
These have some advantages over lasers, including greater portability.

Gentian violet
Gentian violet (also known as crystal violet) is a purple dye that stains the fatty 
components of sweat. It is particularly useful for developing latent fingerprints 
present on the adhesive surface of good-quality sticky tape, although it does not 
work well on Sellotape. It is also very effective on latex gloves.
Iodine fuming
Iodine fuming is one of the oldest techniques used to develop latent fingerprints but 
is currently used only rarely. It can be applied to practically any surface, both porous 
and non-porous (although the results usually show up best against a light-coloured 
background). When heated, iodine crystals undergo a process called sublimation 
whereby they change directly from the solid state to a gaseous one, without forming 
a liquid first. When latent prints are exposed to iodine vapour, a reaction may take 
place between the fumes and some component of the latent print to produce a 
yellowish-brown print. Importantly, the use of iodine fuming is not detrimental to 
the use of other, subsequent, visualisation techniques. Note that iodine-developed 
fingerprints are prone to fading but can be fixed with a-naphthoflavone solution, 
which gives a blue image.
Ninhydrin and/or DFO application 
Ninhydrin (triketohydrindene hydrate) is an extensively used reagent for developing 
latent prints on porous surfaces, such as paper, cardboard, plasterboard or Artex. 
It is also effective in developing bloody fingerprints on most porous surfaces. A 
solution is made by dissolving ninhydrin crystals in a suitable solvent. In the UK, 
the recommended solvent from the Home Office is HFE 7100 but a number of other 
solvents have been developed for this purpose. The resultant solution is applied to 
the evidential object, often as a fine spray. The ninhydrin reacts with amino acids 
present in the perspiration component of the latent print to give a bluish-purple 
colour, known as ‘Ruhemann’s Purple’. This coloration can take up to several days, 
or possibly more, to develop but heat and increased humidity can accelerate the 
chemical reaction. Such conditions may be effectively provided by a humidifying 
oven, in which fingerprints can be developed in approximately 2 minutes. However, 
this treatment is not suitable for Artex, bare wood or plasterboard. These substrates 
are usually wrapped in black plastic and left until the fingerprints develop fully 
(usually after about 10 days). 
 
Once developed, ninhydrin-treated prints may be subjected to further 
enhancement, such as spraying with a zinc chloride solution, which makes the 
prints highly fluorescent, and then viewing them under an argon laser.
 
Another reagent that reacts principally with the amino acids present in fingerprints 
is the ninhydrin analogue DFO (1,8-diazafluoren-9-one). This produces a red-coloured 
fluorescent product, which needs to be viewed with a laser or high-intensity light 
source (thus necessitating the extra step of fluorescence examination). DFO may be 
applied to similar types of surface to those that may be treated with ninhydrin. If both 
reagents are used during the sequential processing of fingerprints, it is recommended 
that DFO be used first.
FINGERPRINTS n 117

 
Physical developer (PD) 
In the PD technique, a sequence of aqueous solutions is used to visualise latent 
prints on porous surfaces, especially paper, that have been wet. This procedure 
involves the immersion of the evidential object in a prewash solution of maleic acid 
(i.e. cis-butenedioic acid), followed by submersion in the PD working solution. This 
latter solution is composed of a mixture of a redox solution (an aqueous solution of 
ammonium ferrous sulphate, ferric nitrate and citric acid), surfactant solution and 
silver nitrate solution. After thorough rinsing in water and drying, the developed 
prints are photographed. The application of PD can often achieve results where 
other visualisation techniques have failed. As mentioned earlier, it is especially 
useful for paper that has been wet but is also effective on chip wrappers and 
materials soaked in petrol.
Powders 
The application of powder to latent fingerprints is the most common visualisation 
technique in use today. It is suitable for hard, relatively smooth, non-porous surfaces 
(e.g. tiles and mirror glass) and works by adhering to any grease and/or dirt present in 
the print. In the UK, fingerprint powders are usually used at the crime scene when the 
objects under test cannot be submitted to the laboratory for appropriate treatment. 
In this situation, grey aluminium powder is generally applied, although black or white 
powder may sometimes be used instead. In the laboratory, coloured powders are used 
to enhance fingerprints that have been previously developed using superglue fuming 
(see later); they are very rarely used on undeveloped latent prints. Once an appropriate 
fingerprint powder has been selected for the surface under test, it is most commonly 
applied with a brush, synthetic fibre ones having largely superseded those composed of 
natural bristles.

 118 n TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART II: FINGERPRINTS AND OTHER MARKS AND IMPRESSIONS

 
 
As well as the various coloured powders, there are a number of other types of 
fingerprint powder available. For example, in some instances (e.g. on human skin and 
finished leather) the use of magnetic fingerprint powder is more appropriate for print 
development. A special device, known as a magnetic powder applicator, is used to apply 
magnetised powder to the surface in question without the need to touch it (Figure 4.5). 
The integral magnet removes excess powder from the print, leaving it clearly visible. 
 
Fluorescent and phosphorescent powders (known collectively as luminescent 
powders) constitute another type of fingerprint powder. These are often applied to 
prints after they have been developed using other visualisation techniques. When 
exposed to laser or ultraviolet (UV) light, the luminescent powder emits light, thus 
enhancing the appearance of the developed print.
Radioactive sulphur dioxide
This technique has some use in detecting latent fingerprints on a number of 
different surfaces, including clean, fine fabric, adhesive tape and paper, although 
it is used very rarely. Briefly, radioactive sulphur dioxide gas (SO2) is applied to the 
surface under test and reacts with the water component of any latent fingerprints 
present. These prints may be subsequently detected by autoradiography. 
Small-particle reagent
This reagent is composed of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) particles suspended 
in a solution of detergent. Small-particle reagent may be applied to exhibits either 
by dish or spray application. The molybdenum disulphide particles adhere to the 
fatty components of any latent fingerprints present, forming a grey deposit. Small- 
particle reagent is principally recommended for use in wet conditions outdoors or 
on waxy or polystyrene surfaces but, in practice, is usually not as effective as other 
appropriate development processes.
Solvent black 3 (Sudan black)
Solvent black 3 may be used to develop latent fingerprints on a number of non-porous 
substrates, such as metals and plastics, and is especially effective when these surfaces 
are covered with a film of grease or oil. The images produced by the reaction of this 
dye with the fatty constituents present in the latent fingerprints are blue-black in 
colour. In the laboratory a formulation of this dye based on ethanol is used, but for the 
crime scene a new formulation (based on methoxypropanol) with lower flammability 
has been developed.
Superglue fuming
Fuming with superglue vapour (ethyl cyanoacrylate) is a relatively recent technique 
that is suitable for use on a variety of non-porous surfaces, such as rubber, metals 
and electrical tape. It is simple to perform but potentially very hazardous. It must 
therefore be carried out in a chamber fitted with a suitable extraction system, 
such as internal carbon filters. Although originally a laboratory-based technique, 
a portable version of superglue fuming has been recently developed by Foster & 
Freeman Limited for use at the crime scene itself.
FINGERPRINTS n 119

 
 
Treatment with superglue vapour causes the development of a hard white 
polymer on some latent fingerprints. Note that the negative image is usually used 
for identification purposes, so that the ridges appear in black (Figure 4.4). This 
polymerisation of the superglue, believed to be catalysed by the water content of the 
fingerprint, is effective in conditions of 80 per cent relative humidity, atmospheric 
pressure and room temperature (taking only a few minutes to develop). The rate of 
development can be accelerated further by heating the superglue to approximately 
120 °C to encourage its evaporation. The active circulation of the air within the 
chamber used for fuming will also speed this process up. Most items subjected to 
superglue fuming are subsequently stained with a fluorescent dye, such as Basic 
Yellow 40, followed by fluorescent examination. This further enhancement helps to 
maximise the number of fingerprints developed.
Vacuum metal deposition 
Vacuum metal deposition involves the evaporation of a metal, usually zinc or gold 
(or a combination of both), and its deposition, under vacuum, as a thin film on the 
latent print. It is particularly useful for the detection of latent prints on non-porous 
surfaces that are smooth, such as plastic packaging materials (e.g. polythene, glass, 
and photographic prints and negatives).
During the processing of a crime scene (Chapter 2), small items suspected of bearing 
latent fingerprints, which are suitable for chemical treatment, are packaged by SOCOs 
and sent to the in-force chemical enhancement laboratory (CEL). Here, highly trained, 
specialist laboratory staff select the most appropriate visualisation technique for 
each of the items submitted. In some cases, it may be necessary to apply more than 
one technique before a print is adequately developed. Therefore, the operator must 
be aware of the sequence in which different techniques can be applied in order to 
maximise the chances of success. Illustrative flow charts for the sequential processing 
of latent fingerprints on different types of surfaces are given in the Fingerprint 
development handbook (see Further reading), two examples of which are shown in 
Figures 4.6 and 4.7. Consideration must also be given to the possible effects of the 
different visualisation techniques on other types of forensic evidence that may be 
present. After suitable development, photographic images are sent to the Fingerprint 
Bureau for comparison and identification.
 
There will be items at the crime scene that are too large or otherwise unsuitable 
for submission to the CEL. If these have appropriate (ideally non-porous, smooth and 
reasonably flat) surfaces, they may be dusted in situ with aluminium powder to reveal 
any latent fingerprints present. Any developed fingerprints may then be photographed 
before being lifted either with special adhesive tape or with gelatine lifters. Gelatine 
lifters are flexible pads, approximately 1 mm thick, composed of a layer of low-adhesive 
gelatine sandwiched between a backing sheet and a plastic cover sheet. In use, the 
cover sheet is removed and the gelatine pad applied to the surface in question. Once 
the print is lifted, it is preserved either by replacing the cover sheet or by covering the 
gelatine with clear sticky-backed plastic. Gelatine lifters can be cut to the required 
size and are particularly useful where the surface bearing the print is uneven. After 
labelling, lifted prints are sent to the in-force Fingerprint Bureau, where they are 
input into IDENT1 (Section 4.1.3). It should be noted that it is not possible for lifted 
fingerprints to undergo any further chemical enhancement. However, their clarity may 
be improved by the use of digital imaging.

4.2 Footwear impressions
In some cases, footwear impressions can provide decisive evidence linking a 
suspect with a particular incident scene. They can also yield valuable information 
about, for example, the number of individuals involved and their movements at 
or near the scene of the crime. The recovery of the maximum possible number 
of footwear impressions from an incident scene is therefore of great importance, 
notwithstanding the often-laborious nature of this task. 
4.2.1   Types of footwear impression, and their   
detection and recovery
Footwear impressions may be divided into two basic groups: two-dimensional 
impressions and three-dimensional impressions. 
Two-dimensional footwear impressions
This type of impression is made when the undersole of a shoe3 encounters a hard, 
flat surface such as a linoleum floor or a counter top. In many cases, material is 
transferred from the sole of the shoe and deposited on the substrate. These are 
known as positive impressions and include those made with wet mud or blood. 
Positive impressions are usually readily visible, at least in the initial stages before 
the material adhering to the sole wears off and the prints become latent (i.e. 
invisible to the naked eye). Less frequently, two-dimensional impressions are made 
by the removal of residual material from a flat surface, thus creating negative 
footwear impressions. These may occur, for example, when impressions are made in 
dust or on a surface covered with a thin film of wax polish.
 
As many two-dimensional impressions are virtually impossible to detect with the 
naked eye, a useful first step is to illuminate suspect areas with a high-intensity 
light shone from an oblique angle. This simple technique helps to show up a variety 
of different types of latent footprint. Footwear impressions (accompanied by a 
scale) should always be photographed at the crime scene, with shots taken from 
directly above, at various angles, and also to show the position of the prints within 
the context of the crime scene itself.
 
The contrast between footprints found at the scene and their background may 
be enhanced by the application of a suitable chemical technique and the footprints 
then re-photographed. For example, in the case of faint footwear impressions made 
in blood, spraying with the reagent luminol significantly increases the visibility of the 
prints through the chemiluminesce produced by this reaction (Chapter 5, Figure 5.1). 
Note, however, that this reaction must be viewed under conditions of total darkness. 
In other cases, enhancement techniques that are suitable for developing latent 
fingerprints are also applicable to footwear impressions. Examples include dusting 
with aluminium or Magna Black powder, superglue fuming (usually followed by the 
application of a suitable powder or dye) and ninhydrin treatment (Section 4.1.5). 
3 Note that throughout Section 4.2 the word ‘shoe’ is used to indicate any type of footwear.
FOOTWEAR IMPRESSIONS n 123

 
 
Enhancement may take place either in situ, or in the forensic laboratory if the 
object bearing the print is easily transferable. If it is not feasible or appropriate to 
remove a print-bearing object from the incident scene, it may be possible to ‘lift’ 
the footprints in some way for further forensic examination in the laboratory. In 
the case of dust impressions, which are particularly prone to disturbance, this may 
be accomplished by using a portable electrostatic lifting apparatus (ESLA), such 
as the pocket-size Pathfinder, to transfer the impression onto a Mylar sheet and 
thus preserve it. As with fingerprints, footwear patterns that have been enhanced 
by dusting with aluminium or Magna Black powder may be lifted with gelatine 
lifters (as described in Section 4.1.5). It is worth noting that indented footwear 
impressions on paper surfaces may be successfully detected using the Electrostatic 
Detection Apparatus (ESDA), which is used primarily for the detection of indented 
writing (Chapter 8, Box 8.9).
Three-dimensional footwear impressions
This type of footwear impression is formed when the shoe is impressed into a soft, 
plastic material such as earth, sand or snow. As is the case with two-dimensional 
footprints, these are initially photographed at the crime scene in order to obtain 
a permanent record. They are then preserved, if possible, by taking casts. Plaster 
of Paris and dental stone are both used for casting three-dimensional footwear 
impressions. 
 
To cast a footwear impression in soft soil, a mixture of dental stone and water is 
made using about 300 ml of water to 800 g of dental stone. This gives a thin pouring 
consistency. Before casting, the footwear impression is sealed with hairspray to prevent 
the casting material from damaging the finer details of the impression. After about 
half an hour, the cast (previously inscribed with details for identification purposes) 
can be removed from the impression but should be allowed to air-dry for a further day 
or two before cleaning with suitable brushes and subsequent examination. Care must 
be taken when cleaning soil from the cast, as too much cleaning will remove important 
fine detail. Ideally, this task should be done by an expert in footwear identification.
4.2.2  The creation of test impressions and their  
 
 
comparison with scene prints
Footwear impressions recovered from a crime scene can yield useful information, 
not only about the type of footwear worn by an individual but also about its make. 
This is particularly true of trainers (training shoes), which are currently the most 
popular type of footwear worn. Typically, these have elaborate undersole patterns 
that are usually peculiar to a particular brand, if not to a particular style (or even 
size of a certain style) within that brand. These may be identified by searching 
databases of different sole patterns, such as ‘Solemate’ created by Foster & Freeman 
Limited. This particular footwear database holds over 3500 sole patterns and covers 
220 brands of work wear, casual wear and sportswear. Moreover, standardised sole

pattern codes within the database allow it to be searched using SICAR (Foster & 
Freeman’s shoe print management system). Using this system, unknown scene 
prints may be matched and the make of shoe identified.
 
On 15 February 2007, the Forensic Science Service launched its new online 
system for footwear mark identification know as Footwear Intelligence Technology 
(FIT). This computer database holds thousands of footwear impressions and 
will enable footwear impressions from crime scenes to be rapidly identified and, 
possibly, linked to suspects and to other crime scenes.
 
Footwear impressions may also give information about other aspects of a 
suspect’s shoe such as size (although that of the sole does not necessarily accurately 
reflect that of the actual upper shoe), degree of wear and, very importantly, any 
random damage characteristics present on the undersole.
 
In order to link an individual with a crime scene through footwear impression 
evidence, it is naturally necessary to get hold of the suspect’s shoes. Once acquired, 
these are used to produce test prints for comparison with the scene prints. In the 
case of two-dimensional impressions, test prints can be produced using a variety of 
methods. For example, the soles of the shoes may be covered with a layer of water-
based ink and then imprinted, while worn, onto an acetate sheet. If test prints for 
three-dimensional footwear impressions are required, the suspect’s shoe is used to 
create another such print, in as similar a fashion as possible to that found at the 
crime scene. The resultant impression is then cast as previously described. 
 
When comparing test impressions with scene impressions, the pattern of the 
undersoles must first agree. The size of the undersole and the degree of wear 
present are also significant in matching a particular shoe with footwear impressions 
found at or near a crime scene. However, in order to establish an incontrovertible 
link between the test and scene prints, it is necessary to demonstrate that the 
random damage characteristics, acquired by shoes during general wear, clearly 
match (Figure 4.8). It is only these features that impart a degree of individuality 
to a particular shoe. As well as establishing a link between a crime scene and an 
individual (as demonstrated in the case study outlined in Box 4.2 below), footwear 
impressions may also be important in linking separate crime scenes together. This 
type of evidence enables the police to gather intelligence on the activities of the 
criminals involved.

4.3 Bite marks 
In the collection of evidence from a crime scene, the significance of bite marks 
should not be overlooked. For example, these may be apparent on a victim’s skin 
when the crime is one of rape or some other form of assault. However, bite marks 
may also be present on a variety of inanimate objects connected with the crime 
scene. These may be food items, such as apples, chocolate, cheese or chewing gum, 
or non-food items, such as bottle tops and pencils. In such cases, awareness and 
observation by scenes of crime officers are crucial to their successful recovery.
 
Bite marks are potentially important as evidence because it may be possible, in 
some cases, to make a match between them and the teeth of a suspect. Typically, 
an individual’s teeth show a number of characteristics that can help impart 
individuality to them. These include features such as gaps between the teeth, the 
ridges on their biting edges, their relative positions within the mouth, and whether 
any of the teeth are rotated, missing or broken. The chances of making a match are 
improved with the number of these distinguishing characteristics identifiable in the 
bite mark, the number of individual tooth marks that make up the impression and 
its clarity. Such comparisons are the realm of the forensic odontologist. 
 
The initial stage in the preservation of bite marks is to take photographs using 
oblique lighting. If the bite marks are sufficiently deep, this is usually followed 
by casting in an appropriate medium. Rubber-based dental impression creams,  
for example, are applicable to dental impressions on both human skin and 
water-soluble food items. In the many cases where the material bearing the bite 
marks is perishable, it is important that the treatment of bite marks is not unduly  
delayed as decomposition and/or desiccation processes will inevitably alter  
their appearance.
 
In order to make a comparison between the bite marks found at a crime scene and 
the teeth of a suspect, it is first necessary to make a cast of his or her teeth. This is 
then used to create an outline of the biting edges on a transparent overlay. Various 
methods are employed by forensic odontologists to achieve this, for example tracing 
from a photocopy of the cast, or impressing the cast into wax and then outlining the 
resultant cavities. A more recent method, and one that has been shown to improve 
the accuracy of the result, involves the use of computer technology. The cast of the 
suspect’s teeth is scanned into a computer and used to produce a detailed outline 
of the biting edges, only 1 pixel thick, which is then printed onto a transparent 
sheet. This sheet bearing the outline image of the suspect’s teeth is then carefully 
positioned over a photograph of the crime scene bite marks and the two compared. 
 
The evidence provided by bite marks has, on occasion, proved highly significant 
in securing a conviction. In a number of notable cases, bite marks and bruises 
found on the body of the victim have been found to correspond with the teeth of a 
suspected attacker (Box 4.1). Moreover, recovery of saliva from the vicinity of the 
victim’s injuries may lead to confirmation of the attacker’s identity through DNA 
profiling (Chapter 6).

4.4 Tool marks
Tool marks are frequently present at crime scenes, particularly when the crime 
is one of burglary. Such marks or impressions may provide evidence that can, on 
occasion, lead to the positive identification of a tool, and, by association, to the 
identity of a suspect. Even when a suspect tool is not available, tool marks left at 
one crime scene may be found to match those found at others, thus establishing a 
vital intelligence link between separate crimes.
 
Tool marks may be made by a variety of different instruments. Some, such as 
screwdrivers and crowbars, are used as levers, while others, for example drills and 
wire cutters, are used as cutting implements. The marks and impressions left behind 
by tools may provide only general information about their shape and size. However, 
much more important in terms of tool identification are any striations that are 
detectable in the tool mark. These are caused by irregularities present on the edges 
of the tool itself (be it chisel, crowbar, screwdriver, knife, etc.), which have been 
acquired during the manufacturing process and/or during subsequent usage. These 
random damage characteristics mean that any striations they reproduce in a tool 
mark are uniquely identifiable with that tool. It is therefore possible, in some cases, 
On 15 January 1978, a savage attack took place in the 
Chi Omega sorority house (a female students’ social 
club), Florida State University, Tallahassee, that left two 
young female students dead and two others seriously 
injured. Another student was attacked nearby, about 90 
minutes later, but she survived and was able to describe 
her attacker. 
 
A month later, on 15 February 1978, a young man 
driving a stolen car was stopped in Pensacola, Florida. 
He was identified as Theodore ‘Ted’ Bundy, an escaped 
prisoner who had been serving a 15-year jail sentence 
for the aggravated kidnapping of Carol DaRonch. Her 
attempted abduction took place in Salt Lake City, Utah, 
in November 1974. After his recapture, Ted Bundy was put 
on trial in June 1979 for the Chi Omega murders, a trial in 
which the former law student conducted his own defence.
 
Pivotal among the evidence presented at the trial by 
the prosecution was an enlarged photograph of a bite 
mark found on the left buttock of one of the murdered 
students, Lisa Levy. Importantly, the inclusion of a 
ruler beside the injury at the time the picture was taken 
provided the necessary scale. It was demonstrated in 
court by dentist Dr Richard Souviron that the outline of 
Ted Bundy’s front teeth, created on a transparent overlay, 
and appropriately enlarged, exactly matched that of the 
photographed bite mark. 
 
Ted Bundy was found guilty of the murders of the 
two Florida State University students and sentenced to 
death. After ten years on Florida’s Death Row, he was 
finally executed on 24 January 1989. Before he died, 
he indicated that the number of young women he had 
murdered was in the region of 40–50 individuals. 
These sexually motivated killings had taken place in a 
number of American states apart from Florida, including 
Washington, Utah and Colorado, during the decade prior 
to his arrest in 1978 for the Chi Omega murders.

to make a positive match between a particular tool mark and the instrument that 
made it. 
 
When tools have obviously been used in an incident, the crime scene should 
first be searched for any fragments that may have broken off the tool during use, 
particularly in the vicinity of a forced entry. It may be possible to demonstrate 
that a particular piece of a tool recovered from a crime scene fits perfectly with 
a damaged tool found in a suspect’s possession and was therefore originally part 
of it. It should be noted that manufacturing marks may also be significant when 
matching fragments of a tool together. As well as tool fragments, it is important 
that valuable trace evidence associated with the use of tools is not overlooked at 
the scene of a crime. This may consist of substances, such as oil or even blood, 
deposited in the tool mark by the tool, or, conversely, material, such as wood or 
paint, that has been transferred from the damaged surface onto the tool. 
 
The first stage in the recovery of tool marks from a crime scene is usually to take 
photographs. The tool marks are first photographed to show their context in relation 
to the wider crime scene and then close-ups are taken. The correct positioning of 
the camera (i.e. with the plane of the film parallel to that of the tool mark), the use 
of oblique lighting and the inclusion of a scale are all vital elements in producing 
close-up photographs of acceptable quality. However, although important as a 
back-up method, photography in itself is not the best recovery method for tool marks 
found at a crime scene, since much of the fine striation detail of the tool mark is not 
reproduced in the resultant print. If possible, it is much better to physically remove 
the area of damage for later examination in the laboratory. Great care must be 
taken in the packaging and transportation of objects bearing tool marks, in order to 
prevent any damage or contamination. It is also necessary that any suspected tools 
recovered from the crime scene should be treated in a similar fashion. They should 
never be placed into tool marks to test for fit, since such an action could lead to 
contamination and/or damage of the evidence. If it is not feasible to remove the 
tool impressions from the crime scene, it is possible, in some cases, to take casts of 
them using a suitable casting material such as silicone rubber or dental impression 
cream. However, like photography, this is very much a secondary method, as casting 
will usually result in the loss of a considerable amount of fine detail.
 
If a suspect tool is found, it can be used to create a number of test impressions 
for direct comparison with the scene tool mark(s). This is done by impressing the 
instrument into a suitably soft medium such as a rubber-based compound. When 
making test impressions, it is important to try to imagine how the tool might have been 
used at the crime scene and to recreate this type of action as near as possible. A series 
of test impressions made at slightly different angles and under different amounts of 
pressure will help maximise the chances of obtaining a test impression that replicates 
how the tool was used in the commission of the crime, thus allowing it to be realistically 
compared with the scene tool mark. Comparison of test and scene tool marks is usually 
performed using the comparison macroscope. In the example illustrated in Figure 4.9, 
a scene impression made with a screwdriver is compared with a test impression created 
with a suspect screwdriver. Note that, in this case, the extremely close match observed 
between the striations of the two images shows a unique match, thereby demonstrating 
that the two marks were made by the same tool. Tool mark evidence has been crucial 
in a number of cases in connecting a suspect with a crime scene, as exemplified in the 
murder of Kevin Jackson outlined in Box 4.2.

On 30 December 2001, 31-year-old Kevin Jackson 
was fatally wounded when he intercepted a gang of 
car thieves attempting to steal the Toyota RAV4 jeep 
belonging to his father-in-law, parked outside his 
house on the outskirts of Halifax, West Yorkshire. Two 
days later, on 1 January 2002, the father of two died 
in hospital. He had received repeated wounds with a 
screwdriver-type implement, culminating in a fatal blow 
to the left side of his head.
 
Launching their investigation, the police focused 
their attention on known car criminals. This led to the 
arrest, a few days later, of Rashad Zaman (aged 21). 
Examination of his car by a Forensic Science Service 
(FSS) scientist led to the discovery of a screwdriver in 
the boot. DNA analysis of minute amounts of blood 
found at the blade–handle junction of the screwdriver 
revealed a match with that of the victim, Kevin Jackson. 
Furthermore, examination by a tool mark specialist of 
the damage marks present inside the lock of the RAV4 
showed that the screwdriver found in Zaman’s car boot 
was the implement used in the attempted theft.
 
In the ensuing weeks, two further suspects, Raees 
Khan (aged 21) and Rangzaib Akhtar (aged 20), were 
arrested. Searches of the residences of the three 
suspects led to the recovery of a number of evidential 
items. Key among these was a pair of Rockport boots 
from Rashid Zaman's house that were spattered with 
blood. Again, DNA analysis revealed a match with that 
of the victim, the pattern showing that the wearer 
of the boots must have been in close proximity to 
the attack. A further piece of evidence, and one of 
immense importance to the case, was the recovery of 
skin fragments from beneath the victim's fingernails 
that were used to procure a full DNA profile. This DNA 
profile was found to match that of one of the suspects, 
Raees Khan. Another type of evidence linking the 
suspects with the crime scene concerned footwear 
impressions left in the snow. Examination by a footwear 
specialist from the FSS showed that some of the scene 
prints matched a pair of Nike trainers recovered from 
the home of Rangzaib Akhtar, while others matched the 
Rockport boots mentioned previously. 
 
On 20 December 2002, at Leeds Crown Court, all 
three defendants were found guilty of murder. Zaman 
and Khan were sentenced to life imprisonment, while 
Akhtar was given custody for life. On 26 November 
2004, Khan’s appeal against conviction was dismissed 
by the Court of Appeal. Applications by Zaman and 
Akhtar for leave to appeal against conviction were also 
dismissed on that date.

4.5 Tyre marks
The majority of major crimes involve the use of a motor vehicle of some description 
and, in some cases, this vehicle will leave tyre marks at the scene. It is important 
that any such evidentially valuable marks are accurately recorded by photography 
and preserved. Tyre marks are largely formed by the tyre tread (i.e. that part of the 
tyre that normally makes road contact), of which there is a multitude of different 
designs. This type of forensic evidence can give valuable information about the make 
and specification of the tyre(s) involved in an incident and, if a suspect vehicle is 
available, may be used to make a positive identification.
 
Tyre marks found at a crime scene may be categorised into one of the three 
following groups:
n Latent tyre prints. This type of print is invisible to the naked eye and, as 
such, is easy to miss during a search of the incident scene. Latent prints 
are commonly found on smooth substrates and may be formed, for example, 
when a dust-laden tyre runs over a cardboard box. In this particular example, 
the tyre print would usually be lifted with a black gel lift and photographed. 
In other instances, appropriate chemical enhancement techniques may be 
used for latent tyre prints. For example, if a latent tyre track is contaminated 
with grease, Sudan black may be applied, while for those containing protein, 
ninhydrin or DFO may be effective (Section 4.1.5).
n Visible tyre prints. This type of print may be positive or negative, depending 
on how it is made. Positive visible tyre prints are formed when a substance, 
such as blood or mud, is picked up by a tyre and then deposited onto a 
comparatively uncontaminated surface. Negative visible tyre prints are 
created when the tread of a tyre removes material from a substrate. This may 
occur, for example, when a vehicle is driven over a thin layer of snow.
n Plastic tyre prints. Prints belonging to this group are three-dimensional, 
negative prints formed when the tread of a tyre is impressed into a suitably 
soft substrate, such as deep snow or soft earth.
There are many similarities between the treatment of tyre prints and that of 
footwear impressions (Section 4.2). As with three-dimensional footprints, the next 
stage in recording plastic tyre prints, after photography, may be to make casts using 
an appropriate casting material. Dental stone, for example, is suitable for casting 
impressions made in soft earth or sand (see Section 4.2.1 for technique details). It 
is usually only practicable to cast a short portion of a tyre mark (of approx. 60 cm in 
length), whereas, with photography, the entire tyre track can be recorded by taking 
sequential photographs that slightly overlap. Casting is probably best viewed as an 
important secondary method that may show details not apparent from photographs. 
 
Once recovered, scene prints can provide valuable information that leads not 
only to the identification of the type of tyre, but also to the makes, and even years 
of manufacture, of motor vehicles on which such tyres were originally used. As 
mentioned previously, tyre tread designs are hugely variable and complex. They can 
be used to identify the tyre manufacturer and, through this, possibly, the makes 
of vehicle that could have been involved in an incident. Such information can help 
 130 n TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART II: FINGERPRINTS AND OTHER MARKS AND IMPRESSIONS

 
narrow the field when searching for a suspect vehicle. In some instances, details 
from the sidewall of a tyre may be found impressed on a surface, for example on 
the clothes of a victim involved in a hit-and-run accident. The sidewall, as the name 
suggests, stretches from the tread of the tyre to the wheel rim and typically contains 
specific data (e.g. of tyre size designation), as well as characteristic design detail. 
Such impressions can also lead to the identification of the type of tyre concerned. 
If a suspect vehicle is found, test impressions can be prepared of all four tyres (and 
the spare) for comparison with the scene tyre prints (Figure 4.10).
4.6  Textile products
Strictly, the term textile refers to anything that may be or has been woven. However, 
as fibres (i.e. thin, flexible, highly elongated objects) are the fundamental unit of 
textile products, the term textile is also used in a broader sense to include most 
non-woven products that are principally made from fibres, including ropes.
 
Textile products can be of highly significant evidential value. Not only can 
they provide information based on the characteristics of their constituent fibres

(Chapter 3, Section 3.1), but they can also be examined to reveal details of their 
construction, mode of manufacture and, in some cases, patterns of wear and 
damage. Such information can be used to provide multiple points of comparison 
between, for example, a sample of textile fabric recovered from an incident scene 
and that found on a suspect or victim.
 
Under certain circumstances, impressions of textile products may be left at an 
incident scene. These may be found in a variety of media including dust, oil, blood 
and plastic materials such as mud and putty. It has even been known for the nose of 
a bullet that has passed through a person to carry an imprint of the fabric worn by 
that person (Chapter 9, Figure 9.8). Impressions of textile products that are more 
commonly encountered include imprints of gloves (as may be worn by a criminal to 
avoid leaving his or her fingerprints) and imprints of the clothing of a hit-and-run 
victim on the vehicle involved in the incident.
 
In many cases, examination of a textile product (or its impression) found at a 
scene is sufficient to allow class characteristics to be determined. These will enable 
the examiner to state whether or not it is possible that two samples have a common 
origin or, indeed, whether a given sample of textile product could have produced a 
particular impression. Less frequently, the presence of patterns of wear or damage 
have allowed examiners to make an unequivocal link between textile evidence found 
at an incident scene and that recovered from the belongings of a victim or suspect.
4.6.1  Damage to textile fabrics
A textile fabric is a manufactured product with useful mechanical strength that has 
a large area to thickness ratio and that is composed of fibres or, more commonly, 
yarns. (A yarn is a long, thin textile product made up of fibres.) Textile fabrics are 
used to manufacture clothing and a wide range of household products, including 
towels, tablecloths, bed sheets and carpets. The examination of patterns of damage 
to textile fabrics can reveal information about the way in which the damage occurred.
 
Violent crimes, such as physical assault, rape and murder, frequently result 
in damage to objects made from textile fabrics, usually clothing. The systematic 
examination of such damage, both with the naked eye and with the aid of 
magnification, will reveal features that are evident at three different levels, namely:
n the garment and fabric, such as the position of the damage relative to any 
body fluid staining;
n the yarn (where present), such as whether the ends produced by a severance 
are neat or frayed;
n the fibres, such as the shape of each severed end.
Taken together, these features reveal patterns that can be useful in crime scene 
reconstruction and as sources of corroborative evidence.
 
Commonly encountered forms of damage include those caused by stabbing 
or slashing with a knife, cutting with scissors, tearing and, in many parts of the 
world, the discharge of firearms. In any one case, the pattern of damage produced 
is a function of not only the manner in which the damage was inflicted but also the 
properties of the textile fabric that was damaged. As the number of permutations 
of variables that this combination produces is essentially infinite, it is reasonable 
 132 n TRACE AND CONTACT EVIDENCE, PART II: FINGERPRINTS AND OTHER MARKS AND IMPRESSIONS

 
to suppose that each pattern of damage will be unique. Furthermore, actions such 
as washing the fabric after the damage was inflicted may have modified the pattern 
before it can be subjected to forensic examination. In addition, the pattern may 
have been complicated by, for example, further damage made by medical personnel 
in the course of the treatment of a wound.
 
Bearing all of this in mind, it would appear that it is extremely difficult, if not 
impossible, to draw any conclusions about the cause of a given example of textile 
damage by an examination of its pattern. However, this is not generally the case. 
This is in part due to the fact that a given class of cause of damage tends to produce 
characteristic damage features in a given class of textile fabric (e.g. a knitted 
fabric). On this basis, it is usually possible to distinguish between, for example, a 
severance caused by tearing and one produced by a slash cut (Table 4.1).

Once a hypothesis has been formulated regarding the cause of a given damage 
pattern, it can be tested by performing carefully controlled simulation experiments. 
These involve using a suspect implement, or implements, to cause damage to the 
textile fabric in order to establish the characteristic damage features that they 
form. These features can then be compared with the characteristics exhibited by the 
damage in question. In such tests, the greatest comparative value can be obtained 
by using the crime-damaged textile fabric in the simulation experiment. However, 
it is important that any other necessary forensic tests are carried out on both the 
questioned sample of textile fabric and the suspect implement before conducting 
any simulation experiments. Otherwise, valuable evidence, for example latent 
fingerprints on the suspect implement, may be destroyed.
Problems
1. Latent fingerprints are detected on a beer glass used in an attack in a public 
house. Describe the different types of technique that may be used in order 
to make the fingerprints sufficiently visible for subsequent comparison 
and identification. Why is the order in which these techniques are applied 
important to their successful recovery?
2. Write an essay describing the challenges involved in using footwear 
impressions recovered from an incident scene to identify a suspect individual.
3. A Scenes of Crime Officer notices an apple core on the dashboard of a 
crashed stolen vehicle. Is this particular object of any evidential value to the 
investigation? Give reasons for your answer.
4. During a forced entry into the back of an off-licence, impressions in the wood 
of the doorframe indicate that a chisel has been used. Two weeks later, a tool 
of this type is found in the garage of a suspect. Discuss the steps that need to 
be taken in order to establish whether this particular instrument could have 
been used in the break-in. 
5. Tyre tracks from a getaway vehicle are found in a snowy coniferous wood. 
Discuss the information that may be obtained from this type of impression 
if (a) no suspect vehicle is found and (b) a suspect vehicle is located. In the 
n Evidence gathered from an incident scene may take 
the form of recoverable items (see Chapter 3) or it 
may involve the recording and preservation of various 
marks and impressions left at the scene (dealt with in 
this chapter). Within this latter group, fingerprints are 
of particular importance, not only because they are 
commonly associated with crime scenes, but because they 
can be used to identify the individual(s) involved. In a 
restricted number of cases, bite marks, either on a victim’s 
body or on inanimate objects such as food items, may be 
significant in identifying the perpetrator of a crime.

the human body, others may be left by items of clothing

other marks and impressions may be left by objects used

activities. Tool marks and the tyre marks of vehicles both 
fall into this last category. Textile products may also be 
of evidential value, not only as the causal agent of scene

Chapter objectives 
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
> Outline the composition and biological function of each of blood, semen and saliva.
> Describe the presumptive tests used to determine whether a body fluid found at a 
crime scene is blood, semen or saliva. 
> Explain the basis on which serological tests work, with particular reference to their 
use in various types of blood testing.
> Understand the importance of bloodstain pattern analysis in the investigation of

Introduction
The scene of a violent crime is often characterised by the presence of certain types 
of body fluids. Those most commonly encountered are blood, saliva and, in the 
case of sexual assault, semen. Such materials can be used to establish crucial links 
between the victim and the perpetrator of a particular crime.
 
In this chapter, blood, saliva and semen are examined in turn. In each case, the 
composition and biological functions of the fluid concerned are described, followed 
by an exploration of the traditional methods used in their forensic analysis. This 
chapter does not cover DNA analysis, which is dealt with in Chapter 6.
 
This chapter also includes a section devoted to bloodstain pattern analysis. The 
interpretation of this type of evidence can yield valuable information about the 
events that took place during a violent assault and, possibly, give some indication of 
the order in which these events occurred.
The examination of 
body fluids

5.1 Blood 
5.1.1  The composition and function of blood
Blood is a fluid medium, which in humans, and in other vertebrates, is found 
within the cardiovascular system. This system consists of the heart, which 
performs as a muscular pump, and the blood vessels, which serve to circulate the  
blood to different parts of the body. Blood has numerous functions. It acts as an 
internal transport system carrying, for example, waste products for excretion 
and nutrients for metabolism. It also plays an important role in maintaining body  
temperature, defending against infection and protecting the body from the con- 
sequences of injury.
 
Human blood, in common with that of other mammals, consists of 55 per cent 
(by volume) blood plasma and 45 per cent (by volume) cellular material (i.e. blood 
cells and platelets). Blood plasma is a pale yellow fluid composed of approximately 
90 per cent water and 10 per cent dissolved materials, including antibodies, 
enzymes, hormones, blood proteins, waste products (e.g. carbon dioxide), and 
nutrients such as amino acids and glucose. Substances, for example drugs 
(including alcohol), can also be found in blood plasma and may be tested for as part 
of a criminal investigation (Chapter 7, Section 7.5). Blood serum is blood plasma 
minus its protein content. This clear liquid is exuded when whole blood or plasma is 
clotted. The clotting process involves the use of blood proteins, such as fibrinogen, 
which, as a result, are removed from the plasma, thus producing the serum.
 
The cellular components of blood may be divided into the three main types 
listed below:
n Erythrocytes (red blood cells). These are the commonest type of blood cell 
and account for over 44 per cent of the total blood volume. They occur in 
concentrations in the following ranges: 3.8–5.8 × 1012 cells l–1 of blood 
in women and 4.5–6.5 × 1012 cells l–1 in men. They contain haemoglobin, 
an iron-containing protein, responsible for the carriage of oxygen (and 
carbon dioxide) in the blood. In contrast to most other mammalian cells, 
erythrocytes lack nuclei. 
n Leucocytes (white blood cells). These cells together with thrombocytes (see 
below) constitute less than 1 per cent of the total blood volume. They occur 
in concentrations of 4.0–11 × 109 cells l–1 of blood in healthy adults. White 
blood cells are involved in protecting the body from infection. They may be 
further subdivided into phagocytes and lymphocytes, which are responsible 
for the capture and ingestion of foreign substances (such as bacteria) and 
the production of antibodies respectively. 
n Thrombocytes (platelets). These are non-nucleated cell fragments, which are 
formed from the fragmentation of very large cells called megakaryocytes in 
the bone marrow. Adult humans normally have 1.5–4.0 × 1011 platelets l–1 of 
blood. Thrombocytes are involved in the process of blood clotting.
Cardiovascular 
system 
In mammals, the 
system comprising 
the heart and the 
blood vessels. 
Through the 
pumping action of 
the heart, blood is 
distributed to all 
parts of the body.
Blood serum
The clear fluid that 
remains after blood 
proteins have been 
removed from 
blood plasma by the 
clotting process.
Lymphocytes
White blood cells

the production 
of antibodies in

5.1.2  Presumptive tests for blood
At the scene of a crime, presumptive tests may be used to detect the presence 
of blood that might otherwise be overlooked, either because it occurs in minute 
amounts or because it merges well with its background. In some cases, attempts 
may have been made to clean up the blood at a crime scene prior to the arrival of 
the investigating authorities. Even under these circumstances, however, traces often 
persist, for example in cracks in the walls and floors. Presumptive tests may also 
be employed to indicate whether a particular stain is probably composed of blood 
(and not of some other substance, such as ink, rust or chocolate) before other, 
more complicated, blood-specific tests are carried out (Section 5.1.3). Presumptive 
tests, with the exception of the luminol test (see below), are not usually carried out 
directly on the objects bearing, or suspected of bearing, bloodstains. Instead, they 
are performed on filter paper, or another suitable absorbent material, that has been 
rubbed either over a designated search area or over the stain itself.
 
The presumptive tests used for blood are based on the ability of the haemoglobin 
present in red blood cells (Section 5.1.1) to catalyse the oxidation of certain 
reagents. In most cases, the oxidising agent used is a solution of hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2(aq)). Many of these tests use reagents that change colour as a result of 
oxidation. One example that is widely used is phenolphthalein, which is colourless 
in its reduced form but bright pink when oxidised. The stain to be tested may be 
prepared in the following manner: a small circular piece of absorbent card or paper 
(~25 mm in diameter) is folded in half and then in half again to form a point. A small 
amount of the stain is then scraped onto this point and the chemicals administered 
in the correct order. In the phenolphthalein test (also known as the Kastle–Meyer 
or ‘K–M’ test), a drop of the dye in its reduced form is added to the test material. 
The presence of blood is indicated by the development of a pink coloration when a 
drop of hydrogen peroxide solution is subsequently added. Another reagent that is 
used for this purpose is leuco-malachite green (LMG), which is also colourless in its 
reduced state but blue-green when oxidised. 
 
Colour-change tests are capable of detecting tiny amounts of blood present at 
a crime scene. However, caution should be applied in the interpretation of their 
results as some vegetable materials, such as horseradish and potatoes, which 
contain the enzyme peroxidase, may give positive results. Such results are known 
as false positives. Moreover, it should be noted that, as colour-change tests give 
positive results in the presence of haemoglobin, they do not distinguish between 
human blood and that of other animals. This discrimination requires the application 
of specific tests, notably the precipitin serological test (Section 5.1.3) or the 
analysis of blood DNA (Chapter 6).
 
In some circumstances, the application of the luminol test for blood may be 
more appropriate than the colour-change tests described above. The luminol test 
is particularly useful when, for example, the surrounding surfaces have been washed 
down in order to eradicate any obvious bloodstains. It can also be used to reveal the 
presence of, for example, bloody footwear impressions (Figure 5.1 and Chapter 4, 
Section 4.2). Another advantage of luminol is that it does not adversely affect any 
subsequent ABO or DNA profiling (see Section 5.1.3 and Chapter 6 respectively).
 138 n THE EXAMINATION OF BODY FLUIDS

 
 
To perform the luminol test, an alkaline solution containing both luminol and 
an appropriate oxidising agent, such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium perborate, is 
prepared and sprayed onto the search area. Where blood is present, the luminol 
is catalytically oxidised and, as a consequence, a distinct glow is produced. This 
luminescence may be viewed and photographed under darkened conditions. Again, 
caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of results from the luminol test 
as false positives may be produced by substances such as household bleaches, metals 
and vegetable peroxidases.

5.1.3  Serological tests for blood 
If presumptive testing indicates that a particular stain is composed of blood, the 
next logical step is to ascertain whether that blood is of human origin. This can be 
done by:
n using the precipitin serological test to identify the presence of proteins 
specific to humans (see below, and also Box 5.1 for further information on 
serological tests);
n analysing for DNA sequences specific to humans (Chapter 6).
The precipitin test for species of origin
The precipitin test for species of origin is based on antigen–antibody complex 
formation, which produces a clearly visible, cloudy precipitate. This serological test 
was developed by the German biologist Paul Uhlenhuth in 1901. In his experiments, 
he injected rabbits with protein extracted from the egg of a chicken and afterwards 
harvested the rabbits’ serum. He then introduced this antiserum into the white of 
a chicken’s egg and observed the formation of a cloudy precipitate (precipitin). 
This work was further developed to produce antisera capable of identifying (by the 
formation of a precipitate) the blood protein of humans and a number of other 
different animals.
 
The precipitin test may be applied to bloodstains in a number of different 
ways. For example, it may be conducted in a capillary tube, with a layer of human 
antiserum (i.e. serum containing antibodies specific for human antigens) overlain 
by a layer containing an extract of the bloodstain under investigation. The formation 
Serological tests are based on the interaction between 
antibodies and antigens. Antibodies are proteins 
produced by the lymphocytes (a type of white blood 
cell) in response to the introduction of foreign 
substances (known as antigens) into the body. Antigens 
are generally proteins or complex carbohydrates. The 
interaction between an antibody and its antigen is 
highly specific and, consequently, the diversity of 
antibodies produced as part of the body’s immune 
response is immense. In the normal course of events, the 
resultant antigen–antibody complexes are removed from 
the body by the scavenging activities of another type of 
white blood cell, the phagocytes.
 
In the past, antibodies required for serological 
testing were produced in the following manner. Firstly, 
the antigen for the required antibody was injected into 
the body of a mammal, such as a rabbit. This caused 
the production of the corresponding antibody in that 
animal’s blood. The blood serum containing the specific 
antibody (known as the antiserum) was then harvested 
and used in serological tests to detect the presence of 
the original antigen. However, this practice has been 
superseded by a technique that facilitates the production 
of monoclonal antibodies. Essentially, this involves the 
cloning of the lymphocytes of a sensitised animal to 
produce a pure solution of the desired antibody.

of a cloudy precipitate at the interface between the two layers indicates a positive 
result for human blood. In another method, known as cross-over electrophoresis, 
a gel-coated slide containing twin wells is used. A liquid extract of the bloodstain 
is placed in one depression, while human antiserum is placed in the other. The 
application of an electric current to the slide induces the antibodies (from the 
antiserum) and the antigens (from the blood sample) to move towards each other. 
If a line of precipitation forms where the two meet, then the bloodstain is human in 
origin (Figure 5.2). 
 
Clearly, human antiserum is used first to establish whether the blood sample is 
human in origin. However, if the result is negative, and if it is deemed necessary 
to search further for the species of origin, the precipitin test can be repeated 
using antiserum prepared for other animals. These are commercially available for 
a number of animals including farm beasts and domestic pets. It should therefore 
be possible to determine the species from which a particular non-human bloodstain 
originated, if a suitable antiserum is available. The precipitin test is highly sensitive, 
needing only tiny samples of blood. Furthermore, it has been found to be effective 
for testing dried bloodstains more than a decade old.

Blood typing 
After a bloodstain has been identified as being of human origin, further forensic 
analysis can be used to establish whether it can be associated with a particular 
individual and, if so, to what extent. Traditionally, this involved the use of a number 
of blood typing systems, some based on serological techniques (in this case, the 
reaction of antisera with blood antigens) and some based on variant types of 
protein. However, this type of approach has been superseded by DNA profiling, 
which has a much greater ability to individualise biological evidence (Chapter 6). 
For this reason, only a brief outline of blood typing is included here.
 
Serological techniques have been used in the identification of a number of 
different blood group systems. The first of these systems – the ABO system – was 
identified by the Austrian biologist Karl Landsteiner in 1901. He categorised 
human blood into four broad groups based on the presence or absence of either 
or both antigen ‘A’ and antigen ‘B’ on the surface of red blood cells (Table 
5.1). Figure 5.3 shows the approximate percentage distribution of the ABO 
blood groups in the populations of the UK and Western Europe. It should 
be noted that non-blood body fluids, such as saliva and semen, can also be 
used for the establishment of ABO blood groups, if the individual concerned 
belongs to that portion of the population classified as ‘secretors’ (Box 5.2).

 142 n THE EXAMINATION OF BODY FLUIDS

 
 
Since the discovery of the ABO system, a number of other systems based on blood 
groups have been identified. Notable among these is the Rhesus system discovered 
by Landsteiner and the American immunologist Alexander Wiener in the late 
1930s. They originally identified the Rhesus antigen in Rhesus monkeys (Macaca 
mulatta). Subsequent serological testing demonstrated that approximately 85 per 
cent of the human population contain the Rhesus antigen in their red blood cells. 
Such individuals are said to be Rhesus positive. Individuals who lack the antigen are 
termed Rhesus negative. 
 
In addition to the use of blood groups, other systems have been developed 
based on certain proteins (including enzymes) found in the red blood cells. These 
proteins occur in more than one form within the population and hence are termed 
polymorphic. The variant types of a particular protein can be identified and, as their 
percentage occurrence in the population is known, this information can be used 
to help characterise blood samples. However, to be of forensic use, the proteins 
must be able to withstand drying and ageing. One example of a polymorphic protein 
suitable for forensic analysis is phosphoglucomutase (PGM).
 
The greater the number of independent factors (both blood groups and 
polymorphic proteins) that can be identified in a given bloodstain, the smaller 
will be the percentage of the population possessing that particular combination. 
This can be determined by multiplying together the frequency of occurrence in the 
population of the different factors identified by the serologist. This information can 
be used to associate, or disassociate, a particular bloodstain with a given individual. 
The term ‘secretors’ is given to those individuals who 
have significant concentrations of their A and/or B 
antigens not only in their blood but also in other body 
fluids, such as gastric juice, perspiration, saliva, semen 
and urine. The blood group of secretors can therefore be 
established from non-blood body fluids using traditional 
serological techniques. Approximately 80 per cent of the 
population are classed as secretors, while the remaining 
20 per cent are referred to as ‘non-secretors’.
 
The status of an individual as a secretor or non-
secretor can also provide important information to an 
investigation. For example, if a saliva sample taken from 
the vicinity of a bite mark revealed that the individual 
responsible was a secretor but that taken from a suspect 
showed that he or she was a non-secretor, this indicates 
that the suspect did not inflict the bite mark in question. 
 
However, the importance of the secretor/non-
secretor status of individuals is now essentially of 
historical interest only. This approach has been made 
redundant by DNA profiling (Chapter 6), which can be 
used to identify individuals from any type of available 
biological evidence containing nuclear DNA.

5.2 Bloodstain pattern analysis
Much of the physical evidence present at crime scenes can be used to help establish 
the identity of the individual(s) involved. For example, fingerprints, footwear 
impressions and trace materials such as hairs and other fibres can all be used to 
connect an individual, or individuals, with a particular crime scene, albeit with 
varying degrees of certitude. In contrast, the analysis of bloodstain patterns, a 
form of physical evidence frequently found at violent crime scenes, may provide 
valuable information about what occurred during the course of a crime, and the 
order in which these events took place. It may therefore play a pivotal role in crime 
scene reconstruction (Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2). The interpretation of bloodstain 
patterns requires particular expertise, which is acquired, to a large extent, through 
direct experience. However, the bloodstain pattern analyst should be aware of all 
aspects of crime scene investigation so that any information concerning bloodstain 
pattern analysis can be placed in context.
 
When it is considered that adult human males contain approximately 5–6 litres 
of blood, and adult human females about 4–5 litres, it is not surprising that, in 
many instances of violent crime, copious amounts of blood are found at the scene. 
If the crime is committed indoors, the floors, walls and even ceilings may all show 
evidence of bloodstains. This type of evidence may occur in several rooms within 
a house and therefore the search of the scene, carried out with the aid of a good 
light source, should be both extensive and thorough. As with all types of physical 
evidence, it is essential that all bloodstains present at a crime scene are recorded by 
an appropriate combination of notes, sketches, photographs and/or video footage 
(Chapter 2, Section 2.3) before they are disturbed by the investigators. 
 
For the purposes of this book, the patterns made by bloodstains present at a 
crime scene are grouped into three basic categories: active, passive and transfer. 
These are discussed in turn below.
5.2.1  Active bloodstains
Active bloodstains are defined here as those caused by blood that has been made 
to travel by a force other than that of gravity. Bloodstains of this type may arise in 
a number of different ways. For example, they may occur as a result of impact to 
the body of a victim with some part of an assailant’s body, such as a fist, and/or a 
weapon, such as a hammer or baseball bat. Bloodstains caused by impact usually 
take the form of a spatter pattern, in which numerous small droplets of blood are 
dispersed over the target surface.
 
Another type of active bloodstain is caused by the projection of pressurised blood 
onto a surface. This occurs most notably when an artery is breached and the heart 
continues to pump. The volume of blood issuing from a punctured artery under 
pressure may be large (known as gushes) or relatively small (termed spurts). The 
overall pattern of these projected bloodstains may clearly reflect the rise and fall 
of blood pressure in the arteries (Figure 5.4). The presence of spines (i.e. linear 
stains) is also characteristic of this type of active bloodstain and is caused by the 
volume of blood involved and the pressure under which the blood is projected.

crime scenes to

crime.
 144 n THE EXAMINATION OF BODY FLUIDS

 
 
A further example of an active bloodstain is one that emanates from a secondary 
object that is soaked with blood, such as the weapon used in an attack. Blood may be 
flung off the object as it is moving or as a result of a sudden cessation in its motion. 
Stains created in this fashion are sometimes referred to as cast-off stains (Figure 
5.5). The pattern produced is characteristically composed of individual drops of 
blood distributed along a line. This line may be curved or straight depending on the 
circumstances of its deposition. By examining such bloodstain patterns, it may be 
possible to deduce the minimum number of times that a victim has been struck, as 
each line corresponds to at least one strike.
 
In addition to general information about the way in which particular bloodstain 
patterns have arisen, the experienced analyst may be able to deduce further 
valuable information from the bloodstain evidence available. For example, in the 
case of active bloodstains, it may be possible to ascertain the direction in which 
droplets of blood were travelling when they hit a target surface (such as a wall). If, 
Figure 5.4 Bloodstain pattern produced by arterial spurting
BLOODSTAIN PATTERN ANALYSIS n 145

 
on impact, individual drops create tear-shaped stains, the direction of travel may 
be discerned from the direction in which the tails of the individual stains point. 
This is usually the same as the direction of travel of the blood droplets (Figure 5.6). 
The one exception to this rule concerns the stains created when a larger droplet of 
blood impacts on a surface, throwing off smaller droplets. The tail portion of these 
smaller, ‘satellite’ stains point towards the parent drop (Figure 5.7). It is therefore 
important to distinguish between parent and satellite stains when interpreting the 
direction of travel.

Detailed examination of bloodstains, whether active or passive, may also yield 
information about the angle at which the blood has hit the surface. This is known as 
the angle of impact. It refers to the acute angle between the trajectory of the drop 
and the target surface when viewed at right angles to the plane of the trajectory that 
is perpendicular to the target’s surface. For example, it is known that an essentially 
circular bloodstain on a hard, smooth, flat surface occurs when the angle of impact 
is approximately 90 °. In general, as the angle of impact decreases, the shape of the 
resultant bloodstain becomes progressively more elongated. Use can be made of 
this to obtain information about the trajectory and point of origin of drops of blood 
(Box 5.3).
Consider a crime in which blood is caused to pass 
through the air and land on a planar surface, such as 
a wall, floor or ceiling. In such cases, trigonometric 
calculations based on measurements taken at the scene 
can often allow important elements of the crime to be 
reconstructed. In particular, it is often possible to 
calculate the angle at which each drop impacted with 
the surface. Also, it may well be feasible to establish 
the location of the origin of any two drops of blood that 
came from the same place and then impacted with the 
same surface in different locations.
 
These calculations are based on the fact that a drop 
of blood passing through the air will rapidly assume a 
spherical shape. When this hits the surface, it will 
produce a stain that is more or less oval. As shown in 
figure (a), the width of this stain (W) is the same as the 
diameter of the drop before impact (i.e. AB). The length 
of the stain (L), however, is not only related to the drop’s 
diameter but also dependent on the angle of impact (θ). 
As can be seen from the diagram, AB (which equals W) is 
the length of the side of the right-angled triangle ABC 
that is opposite to θ. Also, L = BC, the hypotenuse of 
ABC. Therefore:
 
AB 
W
sin θ = (–––) = (––) 
 
BC 
L
and:
 
W
θ = sin–1(––)
 
L
So, for example, if a bloodstain was 5 mm long and 3 
mm wide, its angle of impact, θ, would equal:
 
3
sin–1 (––) = sin–1 (0.600) = 36.9°
 
5
Identical reasoning leads to the conclusion that a 
second bloodstain that is 4 mm long and 3 mm wide was 
formed by a drop that impacted at an angle of 48.6°.

5.2.2  Passive bloodstains 
Passive bloodstains are defined here as those that are formed solely under the 
influence of gravity. They include such features as blood flows, pools and drops. 
 
Passive blood flows found at a crime scene may be extensive, covering surfaces 
and objects, as well as areas of the victim’s body. However, this is not always the 
case as the position of the body, under certain circumstances, can prevent the 
gravitational flow of blood. The interpretation of patterns created by blood flows 
may provide information about whether a body has been moved since death. For 
example, changes in the direction of flow that cannot be attributed to other factors 
(such as characteristics of the surface over which the flow has occurred) indicate 
that the body has been moved. 
 
An examination of other types of passive bloodstains may reveal information 
about the length of time that has passed since the bloodshed occurred. For example, 
in the case of drops and pools, drying times may be estimated by comparison 
with the results of experiments that take into account the surface conditions and 
 
If both of these stains were caused by drops that 
came from the same place, it is possible to calculate 
the position of their origin. As shown in figure (b), an 
imaginary straight line extrapolated from the long axis of 
the first of these stains will intersect with a similar line 
drawn from the second stain. The point of intersection 
of these lines (D) will lie on the surface. An imaginary 
line that passes through this point of intersection and 
that is drawn at 90° to the surface will also pass through 
the place where the drops came from (E). As shown in 
figure (b), two right-angled triangles are therefore 
created that share DE as one of their sides. The length of 
the side adjacent to the angle of impact can be readily 
measured in each of these. Therefore, either triangle can 
be used to calculate the distance from D to E and thereby 
locate the origin of the drops of blood. Take triangle DEF 
for example. The side adjacent to the angle of impact 
(36.9°) is 0.666 metres long. Therefore, the length of DE 
is given by:
tan 36.9° × 0.666 = 0.500 metres
It is even possible to locate E if the lines DG and DF 
are coincidental (i.e. a as shown in figure (b) is 0°). 
Under these circumstances, points D, E, F and G all lie 
in the same plane (figure (c)). The problem is that the 
distances from the stains to point D cannot be measured 
as D no longer lies on the intersection of two lines. The 
strategy now is to measure the distance between the 
stains (i.e. GF) and use the sine rule in triangle EFG to 
establish the length of EF. Then the distances DE and DF 
can be found from triangle DEF. If it is assumed that the 
stains of interest are identical to those described above, 
E^GF = 180° – 48.6° = 131.4°, G^EF = 180° – (36.9° + 
131.4°) = 11.7°.
 
According to the sine rule: 
 GF 
EF
––––––– = –––––––
sin G^EF 
sin E^GF
If GF = 0.225 m: 
     (GF) × (sin E^GF)  0.225 sin 131.4°
EF = ––––––––––––––– = ––––––––––––––––– = 0.832 metres
 
sin G^EF 
  sin 11.7°
From this: 
DE = EF × sin 36.9° = 0.832 × 0.600 = 0.500 metres
and: 
DF = EF × cos 36.9° = 0.832 × 0.800 = 0.66 metres
It should be noted that the methods described above 
for finding the location of the common point of origin 
of drops of blood assume that the drops move through 
the air in a straight line. This is rarely true, not least 
because of gravity. Clearly, therefore, the results of such 
calculations are estimates of the true position of the 
point of origin.
Box 5.3  continued
BLOODSTAIN PATTERN ANALYSIS n 149

 
environmental factors present at the crime scene. Another important aspect 
concerning the drying of pools and standing drops of blood is the initial formation 
of an outer ring of dried blood within a very short time period. This has been 
demonstrated to occur within 50 seconds of the blood being shed. Attempts to 
remove such drying bloodstains after this time, for example by wiping, usually fail 
to eradicate the encrusted outer ring. It is therefore possible to observe whether 
drying bloodstains have been disturbed after their creation (Figure 5.8). 
 
Observation of the shape of a passive bloodstain caused when a drop of blood 
drips onto a surface can reveal information about the angle of impact of the drop. 
This phenomenon is also relevant to the creation of certain active bloodstains and is 
described earlier in Section 5.2.1.
5.2.3  Transfer bloodstains 
Transfer bloodstains are those that have been deposited on surfaces as a result of 
direct contact with objects contaminated with wet blood. The ease with which wet 
blood can be transferred means that this type of bloodstain is commonly present at 
bloody crime scenes. Close examination of transfer bloodstains may yield valuable 
information about the points of contact made between individuals and objects 
during the course of a crime. It may also help to establish the movement of the 
individuals involved.
 
Transfer stains may be created by any object that is wet with blood, including 
weapons used in an attack (e.g. knives or scissors) and parts of the body of the 
victim or assailant, such as the hands, feet or hair. To give a particular example, 
transfer stains may be left when a weapon is wiped on a piece of cloth. The pattern of 
the resultant transfer stain may be detailed enough to enable the bloodstain analyst 
to discern the class characteristics of the weapon that created it. In exceptional 
circumstances, it may be possible to proceed even further and identify the actual 
weapon responsible for a particular stain.

As exemplified previously, the pattern of a transfer stain is of primary importance 
in establishing the type of object that caused it. However, if a particular pattern 
occurs repeatedly, then the movement of the object in question may also be 
followed. In many cases, this type of repetitive pattern is caused by bloodstained 
shoes, feet or hands. After initial contamination, the amount of blood deposited 
decreases with each successive contact until it is eventually depleted and the trail 
of the individual responsible disappears. It is noteworthy that even when a trail 
of transfer stains becomes so faint as to be invisible to the naked eye, it may be 
possible to visualise the prints by the use of the luminol reagent (Section 5.1.2).
 
Bloodstain pattern analysis can be used to help establish the events that took 
place during the course of a violent attack and, to a varying degree, the probable 
sequence in which those events occurred. Included in this type of analysis are 
the location of any bloodstains present at a crime scene and the quantification of 
the amount of blood involved. The interpretation of bloodstain patterns requires 
considerable expertise and experience. For example, the texture of the surface 
receiving the bloodstain will influence the appearance of the pattern and therefore 
needs to be taken into account. The evidence provided by bloodstain pattern 
analysis may be used to refute or corroborate a particular version of events as given 
by a suspect or witness, as in the case of Graham Backhouse outlined in Box 5.4.
 
Another important point that needs to be considered is that not all of the 
blood present at a violent crime scene necessarily belongs to the victim. Some 
of the bloodstains may have resulted from injury to other individuals present, 
especially the assailant(s). If appropriate samples are submitted for analysis, DNA 
profiling (Chapter 6) can be used to identify the different types of blood present. 
Consequently, the decisions made by the person responsible for crime scene 
investigation as to which bloodstains should be sampled for analysis may be pivotal 
to the solution of a particular crime. 
On 9 April 1984, Margaret Backhouse, wife of farmer 
Graham Backhouse, suffered severe leg injuries when 
her husband’s Volvo car exploded as she turned the key 
in the ignition. Subsequent investigations revealed that 
the cause of the explosion was a crude bomb, made 
out of metal piping and containing numerous shotgun 
pellets, planted under the driver’s seat. It was believed 
that the intended target was Graham Backhouse, who 
had previously complained to the police that he was 
the subject of a hate campaign. Before the explosion, 
this campaign had taken the form of threatening 
phone calls and letters and a bizarre event in which the 
decapitated head of a sheep was left on the couple’s farm 
accompanied by a sign warning ‘You Next’.

As a consequence of the events at the 
Backhouses’s farm in Horton, near Chipping Sodbury, 
Gloucestershire, Graham Backhouse received round-
the-clock police protection. However, this was ended, 
at his request, after 9 days had passed and replaced 
by an alarm button linked to the local police station. 
On the evening of 30 April 1984, the sounding of this 
alarm summoned the police to the farm. There, they 
found the body of neighbour Colyn Bedale-Taylor 
with shotgun wounds to the chest and a Stanley 
knife gripped in his hand. Also present was Graham 
Backhouse, with several knife wounds to his chest 
and face, including a deep one that ran diagonally 
downwards from his left shoulder across his body.
 
According to Backhouse, 63-year-old Bedale-Taylor 
had come to his farm that evening and they had argued. 
He alleged that Bedale-Taylor had confessed to planting 
the car bomb that seriously injured Margaret Backhouse 
and then attacked him with a Stanley knife in the kitchen 
of the farmhouse. After a violent struggle, in which 
Backhouse received several knife wounds, Backhouse 
stated that he ran down the hall to get his shotgun, with 
Bedale-Taylor in pursuit. When Bedale-Taylor failed to 
heed a verbal warning, Graham Backhouse shot him. 
 
However, forensic investigation of the murder scene 
revealed a number of factors that were not consistent 
with the story told by Graham Backhouse. Several of 
these anomalies concerned the analysis of bloodstain 
patterns, including:
n the relatively small amount of blood found in the 
kitchen (where the violent struggle between the 
two men was purported to have taken place);
n the absence of ‘splash-type’ bloodstains (usually 
associated with violent struggles) on the kitchen 
furniture and walls;
n the presence of drops of Backhouse’s blood on the 
kitchen floor (a pattern consistent with the dripping 
of blood from a stationary individual);
n the discovery that some of the overturned chairs 
covered drops of blood on the floor (suggesting that 
the furniture had been upset after the struggle and 
not during it);
n the presence of Backhouse’s blood smeared along 
the top of one of the overturned chairs, yet the 
lack of any blood on the gun used subsequently by 
Backhouse to shoot Bedale-Taylor;
n the absence of a trail of blood following the route 
allegedly taken by the wounded Backhouse from the 
kitchen to the end of the hall, where he kept his 
shotgun;
n the discovery that Bedale-Taylor’s hand that held 
the knife was entirely covered with his own blood 
(from his shotgun wounds), indicating that the 
knife had been placed in his grasp after death.
In addition, the pathologist involved in the case stated 
that the deep knife wounds suffered by Backhouse 
could only have been inflicted by another individual if 
Backhouse had remained still and made no attempt to 
ward off the attack.
 
The evidence provided by bloodstain pattern 
analysis was used to reconstruct the events that took 
place at the farmhouse during the evening of 30 April 
1984. It was postulated that Graham Backhouse shot 
Colyn Bedale-Taylor and then attempted to cover up 
his crime by self-inflicting several deep knife wounds 
and disarranging the kitchen furniture to simulate the 
scene of a fight. By killing Bedale-Taylor, Backhouse 
sought to implicate him further in the attempted 
murder of his wife, Margaret (he had already implied 
Bedale-Taylor’s guilt in this respect earlier in the police 
investigation) and therefore divert suspicion away from 
himself.
 
Graham Backhouse was tried in February 1985 at 
Bristol Crown Court for the attempted murder of his 
wife, Margaret, and the murder of Colyn Bedale-Taylor. 
He was found guilty on both counts and given two life 
sentences. His alleged motive in killing his wife was 
to claim the insurance money on her life, which was 
doubled to £100 000 in the month prior to the attempt 
on her life (he had debts totalling £70 000). It also 
transpired that the hate campaign directed at Graham 
Backhouse (see first paragraph) had been orchestrated 
by Backhouse himself.

 152 n THE EXAMINATION OF BODY FLUIDS

 
5.3 Saliva 
5.3.1  The composition and function of saliva
Saliva is 99 per cent water and has a pH of 6.8–7.0. It is produced by three main 
pairs of salivary glands (the parotid, submaxillary and sublingual glands), which open 
into the mouth region via ducts. Saliva performs a number of different functions. It 
cleanses the mouth and provides necessary lubrication. It enables partly broken-up 
food to be formed into a ball (known as a bolus) in preparation for swallowing. This 
process is assisted by the glycoprotein mucin, which is secreted by the sublingual 
glands located on the floor of the mouth beneath the tongue. Saliva also contains 
the digestive enzyme salivary amylase (also known as alpha (a) amylase), which is 
responsible for the breakdown of starch into maltose and dextrins. Cast-off cheek 
cells are also usually present in the saliva.
5.3.2  Presumptive test for saliva
Adults make about 1.0–1.5 litres of saliva per day. It is not unusual for this type of body 
fluid to be present at violent crime scenes, especially in association with bite marks. 
The presumptive test used in the identification of saliva is based on the presence of 
the digestive enzyme salivary amylase and its role in the breakdown of starch. 
 
To perform the test, a sample of the suspect stain is added to a soluble starch 
solution. The reagent iodine, which reacts to the presence of starch, is then added 
to the mixture. If the iodine turns a blue-black colour, starch is present in the 
solution. No digestion of the starch has taken place, owing to the absence of salivary 
amylase, and the body fluid tested is not therefore saliva. If, however, the iodine 
undergoes no reaction and remains a yellow-brown colour, this indicates that starch 
is no longer present in the solution. Breakdown by salivary amylase has occurred 
and the result of the presumptive test for saliva is therefore positive. 
 
In common with other types of biological evidence, saliva can be used to identify 
an individual through DNA profiling (Chapter 6). This is made possible by the 
presence of cells that have been shed into the saliva from the inside of the mouth. 
5.4 Semen
5.4.1  The composition and function of semen
Semen is a fluid produced by the testes (male reproductive glands) and accessory 
sex glands, such as the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. The pH of semen 
(also referred to as seminal fluid) is slightly alkaline, ranging between pH 7.2 
and 7.4. Semen usually contains a high concentration of sperm cells (also known 
as spermatozoa), which are the male sex cells or male gametes. The density of 
sperm cells normally ranges between 5.0 and 15 × 107 cells ml–1. However, in 
some individuals, the density of spermatozoa is abnormally low. If this falls below a 
threshold of 2.0 × 107 cells ml–1, the condition is known as oligospermia. In some 
cases, sperm may be entirely absent from the seminal fluid; a condition termed 
SEMEN n 153

 
azoospermia. This occurs, for example, in males who have undergone a vasectomy 
for sterilisation purposes. Under these circumstances, azoospermia is usually a 
permanent condition. 
 
Both sperm cells and egg cells (i.e. female sex cells or female gametes) contain half 
the normal chromosome complement. The full chromosome complement is restored 
when fusion occurs between a sperm cell and an egg cell (sexual reproduction). The 
sole function of the sperm cell is to reach the female egg cell and fertilise it. This is 
reflected in its structure, which is adapted to give it high motility. In human males, 
the seminal fluid provides a medium in which the spermatozoa can be transferred 
into the body of a female during sexual intercourse. The volume of the ejaculate (i.e. 
emitted seminal fluid) normally ranges between 2 and 6 ml. The average ejaculate is 
3 ml in volume and carries in the region of 3.0 × 108 sperm cells. 
5.4.2  Tests for semen 
In cases of sexual abuse and rape, the presence of semen at the crime scene 
provides highly important forensic evidence. As might be expected, semen can be 
recovered from the body of the victim in many cases. In addition, semen may also be 
collected from, for example, used condoms, bedding, clothes, furniture and carpets. 
For further information on the collection of samples from individuals involved in 
rape cases, the reader is referred to Box 5.5. 
Azoospermia
A condition 
characterised by 
the absence of 
sperm cells from the 
seminal fluid.
In many cases of rape, there are no witnesses to the 
actual assault, other than the individuals directly 
involved. The presence of physical and biological 
evidence is therefore extremely important in 
establishing links between the victim and perpetrator. 
Traces of semen, in particular, are relevant in 
demonstrating that sexual contact has occurred and 
can be used to help establish the identity of the 
perpetrator through DNA profiling. 
 
When a rape has been reported, the victim will 
usually be seen by a police surgeon (note that this 
traditional title is being replaced in more and more 
forces in England and Wales by the term ‘forensic 
medical examiner’ or FME). This role is often performed, 
on a part-time basis, by a general medical practitioner. 
He or she will have been specially trained to deal with 
cases of sexual assault in a sensitive manner. The 
examination of the victim (e.g. for injuries and bruising) 
and the collection of evidence samples are carried out 
according to strict procedural guidelines. In the UK, 
medical examination kits are available for the collection 
of evidence samples in cases of sexual assault. 
 
Note especially that the information about essential 
and non-essential samples given below concerns female 
rape victims and male rape suspects. Those that are 
classified as ‘intimate samples’ are given in blue in the 
lists below, and both victim and suspect are entitled 
to refuse to supply them. However, both victim and 
suspect would usually be particularly encouraged to 
give blood samples for the purpose of drug and alcohol 
analyses, as detection of any such substances could 
have an important bearing on the case.
 
Essential samples from rape victims are:
n clothing (to be removed over a clean sheet of paper, 
which is also submitted for analysis);
Box 5.5
Further information
The collection of samples from individuals involved in rape cases
 154 n THE EXAMINATION OF BODY FLUIDS

 
 
There are a number of tests that can be used for the detection of semen. A 
search of the crime scene using ultraviolet light may reveal the presence of semen, 
although many other materials, including body fluids such as urine, also fluoresce 
under these conditions. Moreover, not all semen fluoresces, and, for this reason, this 
type of search tends to be used later in the search process rather than as a primary 
tool. Direct observation of semen under a high-powered microscope will reveal the 
presence of spermatozoa. If sperm cells are present, this is the most definitive test 
for semen available. However, in conditions of azoospermia, where no spermatozoa 
are present (Section 5.4.1), this test will give a false-negative result. 
 
There are presumptive tests used for the detection of semen that, unlike 
microscopic examination, are not dependent on the presence of sperm cells. For 
example, the acid phosphatase (ACP) test is used both in the search for seminal 
stains and in their presumptive identification. ACP is an enzyme secreted by the 
prostate gland. It is found in very high concentrations in seminal fluid compared 
with other body fluids. In the presence of diazotized o-dianisidine, acid phosphatase 
will react with a-naphthyl phosphate to produce a purple colour. If a body fluid is 
n combings from pubic hair (for ‘foreign’ hairs);
n mouth swab (also known as a buccal scrape) (for 
DNA analysis; note that previously a blood sample 
was taken for this purpose);
n urine;
n vaginal swabs (for the recovery of semen).
Samples from rape victims that may be required, 
depending on case circumstances, include:
n blood samples (for alcohol and drug analysis);
n cervical swab (if more than 2 days have elapsed 
since the alleged rape);
n pulled or cut head hairs (control sample);
n cut pubic hairs (control sample);
n samples of body fluids found on skin.
If an individual is taken into police custody on suspicion 
of carrying out a rape, he will also be examined by a 
police surgeon and items of physical evidence collected. 
 
Essential samples from rape suspects are:
n clothing (to be removed over a clean sheet of paper, 
which is also submitted for analysis);
n combings from pubic hair (for ‘foreign’ hairs);
n mouth swabs (for DNA analysis; note that previously 
a blood sample was taken for this purpose);
n penile swabs; 
n cut pubic hairs (control sample);

Samples from rape suspects that may be required,

n pulled or cut head hairs (control sample);
n samples of body fluids found on skin;

In addition to the essential samples listed above, 
a medical examination must be completed for each 
victim and suspect. All samples, whether taken 
from the victim or the suspect, must be collected in 
accordance with prevailing procedures, designed to 
take into account ethical, legal, medical and scientific 
considerations.

semen, a positive reaction to the acid phosphatase test will occur in less than half a 
minute. A purple colour may also be given by other body fluids (e.g. vaginal fluid). 
However, as the levels of ACP are much lower in these other body fluids, compared 
with those found in seminal fluid, the reaction time will be distinctly longer. False- 
positive results may also be obtained from other substances such as plant phenols.
 
Another test used for the identification of semen that is unaffected by the 
absence of spermatozoa is the p30 test. This uses serological methods to detect 
the presence of p30, a protein produced by the prostate gland. Among body fluids, 
p30 is found almost exclusively in seminal fluid. Hence, this test for the presence of 
semen may normally be considered to be definitive.
 
Once a stain has been identified as semen, its sperm cells can be used to establish 
whether a particular suspect was involved in a specific attack, through the technique 
of DNA profiling (Chapter 6). It is noteworthy that recent developments mean that 
even in rape cases where spermatozoa are absent, limited DNA profiling may now 
be carried out. This is based on the analysis of Y-chromosome DNA obtained from 
skin cells left behind in the body of the female victim by the male perpetrator. This 
test can be used to help to establish that rape has occurred. The limitations of 
Y-chromosome analysis mean that the profiles produced are not unique and this 
test cannot therefore definitively identify the perpetrator. However, it can be used 
to exonerate any suspect whose DNA profile does not match that produced by the 
male skin cells found lodged in the victim. 
Problems
1. A body fluid stain found at a crime scene is identified (by presumptive 
testing) as blood. The next stage is to establish whether the blood is of 
human origin. Describe the underlying principles of the serological test that 
is used for this purpose and outline two of the methods by which this test 
may be applied.
n Body fluids, particularly blood, saliva and semen, are com-
monly found at scenes of violent crime, providing valuable 
items of physical evidence. Presumptive tests are avail-
able for the initial detection of these three common types 
of body fluid, some of which may also be used as search 
techniques.
n Blood, saliva and semen are all examples of biological 
materials and as such may be used to link an individual 
with a specific crime scene using the technique of DNA 
profiling (Chapter 6). This approach has effectively 
replaced the more traditional method of blood typing, 
which uses serological techniques to test blood, and other 
body fluids, to help identify individuals through blood 
group information.
n The patterns created when blood is shed during the course 
of a violent assault can provide valuable information 
about the events that took place. In some cases, it may 
be possible to place these events in a probable sequence, 
based on the evidence available, in order to reconstruct a 
crime. The interpretation of bloodstain patterns is there-
fore an important aspect of body fluid analysis and one that 
requires considerable experience and expertise on the part 
of the analyst. 
5.5 Summary
 156 n THE EXAMINATION OF BODY FLUIDS

 
2. A match is made between the blood of a suspect and bloodstains found at 
a violent crime scene. Traditionally, this would have been done by blood 
typing but this method has largely been superseded by DNA profiling. With 
reference to this chapter and to Chapter 6, compare and contrast these two 
different approaches.
3. Expert interpretation of the bloodstain patterns present at a violent crime 
scene can help to establish the events that took place. Using specific 
examples, discuss how bloodstain patterns can provide pertinent information 
regarding their creation and the probable state of the victim at the time.

Introduction
In 1984, research and insights by Dr Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester, UK, 
led to the development of a procedure initially known as DNA fingerprinting. Its 
impact on forensic science cannot be overstated. Its application to criminal cases 
was rapid and, through some famous cases, was soon brought into the public eye. 
 
Under the pressure of the adversarial legal system and with technical advances 
in genetics, the original DNA fingerprinting procedure has undergone numerous 
modifications and refinements. Modern methods and procedures are more precisely 
called DNA profiling or DNA typing, but in news reports and on the numerous crime 
programmes on television they are still commonly referred to as DNA fingerprinting. 
DNA profiling is almost taken for granted nowadays, but occasionally the elucidation 
of high-profile and dramatic cases based on improved sensitivity and precision 
reminds us that DNA profiling is a remarkable and revolutionary technology. 
 
As introduced in Section 6.1, DNA profiling is one of the most powerful tools 
in forensic science. This chapter aims to describe the background and application 
of the technology. The topics covered are key material for introductory-level DNA 
profiling; extension material can be found on the website associated with this book.
 
To understand how DNA can be so useful forensically, the nature of DNA and 
genes and their relationship to individuality will be discussed in Section 6.2. The

technology of DNA analysis and its application to modern DNA profiling is described 
in Section 6.3. Interpretation of the data generated is covered in Section 6.4. A 
second type of forensic DNA analysis using mitochondrial DNA is described in 
Section 6.5. Concluding the chapter in Section 6.6 is a discussion of potential 
future developments in the forensic use of DNA.
6.1 The forensic value of DNA profiling
DNA profiling has not displaced other important analytical procedures described 
elsewhere in this book; rather, it is used in conjunction with other procedures, 
depending on the nature of the investigation. A DNA profile is rarely the sole piece 
of evidence; it is not allowed to be in the UK. Its development, however, has been 
genuinely revolutionary for forensic science and, when applied in its most powerful 
form, allows a biological sample at a scene of crime or accident to be linked very 
strongly to the individual from whom it originated. Before the development of DNA 
profiling, with the exception of fingerprints (Chapter 4, Section 4.1), this was not 
usually possible.
 
Depending on the events, evidence of biological origin at a scene of crime could 
be hairs, fingerprints, lip-prints, blood, semen, saliva, tissue samples, bone, urine, 
faeces, etc. Successful DNA analysis from these samples produces a profile that has 
the potential to identify a possible source of the evidence, whether the victim or the 
suspect. DNA profiling has progressed to such an extent that, excepting identical 
twins, it is extremely unlikely that two unrelated people could have the same profile. 
Hence, if evidence generates a profile and a suspect’s profile matches it, then it is 
highly unlikely that any other random person could be the source. This contrasts 
with the forensic use of blood type (Chapter 5, Section 5.1.3) or hairs (Chapter 3, 
Box 3.4), which might allow elimination of a suspect but only rarely leads to the 
unambiguous identification of an individual.
 
Technical developments, partly related to sensitivity, have led to wider use of 
DNA profiling beyond that of rape and assaults, with which the first applications 
were associated. Reduced cost of DNA profiling, due to automation and expanded 
provision, has led to its being most commonly used in volume crime cases such 
as burglary and vehicle theft. DNA profiling evidence from biological samples 
greatly increases the chance of finding the perpetrators when there is often a 
lack of witnesses or other evidence in such cases. In accidents and disasters, DNA 
profiling can be used to identify the dead by assigning body parts to an individual. 
Badly degraded, old bodies can be DNA typed to identify the remains when DNA 
is available from possible relatives or from samples of the deceased’s artefacts, 
perhaps a hairbrush, for the purposes of comparison. 
 
The forensic use of DNA is not only possible but is widely applicable because:
n Within the DNA of an individual there are detectable patterns that are 
repeated a number of times that are characteristic of her or him.
n DNA, being a relatively robust molecule, survives well under a wide range 
(but not all) of environmental conditions; if it was labile, its use would be 
limited. DNA is naturally broken down as the cells in biological samples age, 
THE FORENSIC VALUE OF DNA PROFILING n 159

 
but if the conditions are appropriate, such as following rapid desiccation or 
freezing, DNA can survive for centuries. 
n DNA can be isolated from any of a wide variety of biological samples likely to 
be left at a crime scene or incident.
n The source of the DNA (blood, sputum, semen, etc.) does not matter and will 
usually produce the same pattern for any one individual. Exceptions to this 
are known but are rare.
n Sophisticated, precise and extremely sensitive techniques are available, which 
allow the detection of the above patterns in very small samples (a miniscule 
blood spot, a single hair follicle, lip-prints on a glass, physical fingerprints 
and even old, degraded samples can give useful DNA profiles).
n The techniques are relatively cheap and rapid to carry out.
n The data generated are readily assembled into databases in computers, which 
can be searched for a given DNA profile and thereby identify an individual 
from the available pool of information. In the UK, the National DNA Database 
is a huge repository of DNA profiles from individuals and crime scenes 
(Section 6.3.6).
n A strong and widening range of scientific support from the fields of molecular 
and population genetics exists, enabling the appropriate interpretation of 
DNA profiling data to be made (Section 6.4). 
 
Forensic applications of genetics are likely to increase in the future as they are 
undergoing development partly related to other dynamic aspects of the study of 
human genetics such as the Human Genome Project.
 
Before exploring detailed aspects of DNA profiling, it is useful to examine the 
nature of the data it produces and some simple but important points regarding 
their interpretation.
6.1.1 DNA profiles
A full DNA profile of an individual generated by modern technologies is shown in 
Plate 9. There is a large amount of complicated information on this profile, and 
its interpretation occupies much of this chapter. To introduce the topic of DNA 
profiling, it is easier to discuss a simplified version of a DNA profile. Figure 6.1a shows 
a DNA profile (from a different individual from that in Plate 9) in a diagrammatic 
form. The profile is a series of peaks arranged along a baseline resembling a graph. 
The upper panel shows the full profile. For clarity, in the lower three panels the full 
profile has been separated according to the colour of the peaks as they appear on a 
computer screen (as shown in Plate 9). In Figure 6.1a, these different colours are 
represented by solid lines, dotted lines and dashed lines (blue, green and black, 
respectively, in Plate 9). Note that, with the exception of those labelled X and Y, 
each peak is designated with a number. Basically, a profile from another individual 
would differ in the position of some of the peaks along the horizontal axis. The 
pattern of peaks is likely to be unique to a given individual. Simplified, diagrammatic 
examples of DNA profiles are shown in Figure 6.1b. If asked whether the profile from 
suspect 1 or 2 best matches the evidence, it seems trivial to reach a conclusion by 
comparing the patterns and answer suspect 2. It is tempting to conclude that the

evidence must be from suspect 2. Nevertheless, this may not be the case: there is 
more to analysing DNA profiles than simply matching the patterns. To interpret the 
pattern, you must understand how it is derived and what the peaks labelled A, B, etc. 
represent on Figure 6.1b. Also, one needs to know how common particular patterns 
are in the population. Before addressing these issues in Sections 6.3 and 6.4, it is 
worth considering why DNA is related to individuality.
6.2  DNA, genes and their relationship
  
to individuality
DNA profiling works by looking at personal individuality at the genetic level, by 
examining differences between people in their DNA. The aim of this section is to 
explore, in a forensic context, aspects of individuality that have a genetic basis that 
can be revealed by analysing DNA structure.
6.2.1 Individuality and genes 
A person displays his or her individuality in many ways that are often immediately 
apparent – facial characteristics, hairstyle, posture, height, voice, accent, style of 
dress, etc. Such features are in part the result of complex factors, including social 
and family environments, but some also have a genetic basis, for example height, 
fingerprints, eye and skin colour, and sex.
 
If everybody were genetically the same (as in identical twins), they would still be 
individuals and appear different because of environmental influences. DNA profiling 
would be pointless, as there would be no difference genetically between people. DNA 
profiling is, however, immensely powerful because, at the level of genes and DNA, 
people are unique (except identical twins). A person’s unique genotype is produced 
at conception and remains with and dies with that individual. His or her children will 
carry parts of it but combined with another’s DNA. No matter how the appearance 
of a person may change throughout life, their genotype does not change. The term 
genotype refers to the genes and their alleles that the person carries. 
 
DNA profiling attempts to examine the DNA of an individual to produce a unique, 
unalterable pattern that will be a characteristic of any tissue or body fluid that 
originates from him or her.
6.2.2 Genes and DNA
Genes are information; they are biochemical instructions that determine, along 
with environmental factors, the characteristics of humans and all other organisms. 
Familiar examples of such characteristics are blood type and eye, hair and skin 
colour, which are all, at least in part, under the control of genes. These instructions 
are passed from parents to child – the child obtains half his or her genes from the 
mother and the other half from the father. Eye colour, at least in its basic form of 
blue and brown, shows a simple pattern of inheritance. Skin colour is more complex: 
a number of different genes are involved, and colour can also be influenced by the 
environment, for example a pale skin can become brown after sunbathing. 
Genotype
The combination of 
genes and alleles of 
those genes carried 
by an individual; 
his or her genetic 
make-up.
Allele
A particular gene 
can have a number 
of forms, each of 
which is an allele.
 162 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
 
Information can be written and stored in many forms such as on paper, on a CD-ROM 
or on audiotape. For each format, the information might be the same, but it is stored 
and transmitted differently. In each case, the information is written in a language. 
Genetic instructions are written and transmitted as information on DNA molecules.
 
The information carried by most genes constitutes an instruction to make a 
particular protein – it is the protein that influences the characteristic of the person. 
A gene is therefore said to encode a particular protein. For example, the human 
HBB gene encodes the b-globin protein, which is a component of haemoglobin, the 
oxygen-carrying red pigment of blood. As discussed in Section 6.2.4, the genetic 
instructions can be altered in an infrequent but important process called mutation 
to produce different forms of the gene. These different versions of the same gene 
are referred to as alleles. 
 
Using the ABO blood type as an example (Chapter 5, Section 5.1.3), there is one 
gene involved. The gene encodes a protein that alters the surface of red blood cells, 
conferring on them the property known as blood type. Different alleles of the gene 
encode different versions of the protein, each altering the surface of red blood cells 
in a characteristic way and resulting in the different types A, B and O. There is a 
different allele of the gene for type A, type B and type O.
 
A useful analogy here is that of a written recipe for a cake: the recipe (genes) is 
present as paper and ink (DNA); it is the cook (proteins), reading the information, 
mixing the ingredients in the correct order and following the baking instructions, 
that makes the cake (body). To push the analogy, if the recipe is copied from person 
to person, mistakes (mutations) might be introduced in amounts or ingredients, 
and the cakes produced would become slightly different (they would have different 
characteristics because the instructions have been altered).
 
DNA, the material out of which genes are made, is a long complex molecule. Its 
key features are illustrated in Figure 6.2. DNA is a polymer of simpler molecules 
called nucleotides (Figure 6.2a). There are four different nucleotides, which can be 
joined together in any order and for enormous lengths. Each of the four nucleotides 
differs from the others in the type of base that it contains. The bases are adenine, 
cytosine, guanine and thymine. These (and, less formally, the nucleotides that 
contain them) are abbreviated to A, C, G and T, respectively. The language of genes 
is written in an alphabet of these four bases. A specific gene will have a particular 
sequence of bases. This sequence is read by the machinery of the cell, in complex 
processes called transcription and translation, to direct the synthesis of the 
particular protein encoded by the gene. 
 
DNA has the structure of the well-known double helix (Figure 6.2b), which consists 
of two strands, each a polymeric chain of nucleotides, wound around each other. The 
strands consist of sugar molecules, in the nucleotides, linked by phosphate groups, 
forming the sugar–phosphate backbone. If the molecule is untwisted, it resembles a 
ladder, the rungs being the base pairs (Figure 6.2c). Each strand has a 5' end and 
3' end (so-called because of the detailed molecular structure). This gives polarity or 
direction to the strands called the 5' to 3' direction. Note that in the double helix, 
the strands are in opposite directions and are said to be anti-parallel. Attached to the 
sugars are the bases; hydrogen bonds between the bases hold together the two strands 
of the double helix. Note that A can pair only with T, and G only with C: these are the 
base-pairing rules. Hence, if you know the sequence of one strand, that of the other is 
also known by applying the rules of base pairing. The information contained in a DNA 
molecule is its sequence, namely the order of bases along the molecule (Figure 6.2d). 
Mutation
A change in a gene; 
an alteration in its 
DNA sequence. This 
process generates 
new alleles.
Nucleotides
The building blocks 
of the nucleic acids 
DNA and RNA.
Base pairs
An association 
between the bases 
of the nucleotides 
on opposite strands 
of the DNA double 
helix. Hydrogen 
bonds link the bases. 
There are two types 
of base pairs: A–T 
and G–C. The length 
of DNA molecules 
and genes is usually 
measured in base 
pairs.

Each gene is made up of a specific sequence of thousands of the four nucleotides 
(A, C, G and T). The length of the sequence depends on the gene itself and the size 
of the protein it encodes. The length of a section of DNA or a gene is measured in 
base pairs (bp). Figure 6.2d shows a short sequence of DNA 14 bp long, but note 
that DNA molecules can be very long from thousands (103) to hundreds of millions 
(108) of base pairs.
 
In early 2001, the draft sequence of the human genome was published. This is the 
complete DNA sequence of human DNA and the total length is 3.2 × 109 base pairs. 
The organisation of this huge amount of DNA and genetic information is discussed 
in the next section. 
6.2.3 The hierarchy of DNA organisation
DNA is organised into distinct structures within the cells of an organism. Figure 
6.3 shows its various levels of organisation. The short DNA molecule, discussed in 
Figure 6.2, is a section of a longer sequence called a gene (Figure 6.3b). A gene 
sequence contains the information to direct the synthesis of another type of 
nucleic acid called RNA. RNA is also a polymer of nucleotides, but it differs from 
DNA in three main features: the structure of the sugar; a base called uracil replaces 
thymine (Figure 6.2a); it is not usually in a double-stranded helical form. The 
gene sequence in Figure 6.3b contains the information to direct the synthesis of 
messenger RNA (mRNA), which encodes a particular protein that influences the 
phenotype of the organism. Curiously, in the majority of human genes, the genetic 
information encoding a protein is split up into sections called exons. The DNA 
sequences between the exons are called introns; an important point here is that 
not all DNA is involved in encoding proteins. The role of this non-coding DNA is not 
always clear and it is sometimes referred to as ‘junk DNA’.
 
Figure 6.3c shows an even longer DNA molecule carrying several different genes. 
Between the genes is intergenic DNA; in common with intron DNA, this does 
not encode proteins. Chromosomes (Figure 6.3d) are very long DNA sequences 
carrying hundreds or thousands of genes. Each chromosome consists of a single, 
very long DNA molecule wound around and packaged with proteins. Along the 
chromosomes, written in the DNA sequence, are genes. The exact total number of 
human genes is as yet uncertain. Initial estimates of the gene number after the 
genome was sequenced in 2001 were in the order of 30 000–35 000 but since then 
this has been revised to between 20 000 and 25 000.
 
The total set of chromosomes is called the karyotype (Figure 6.3f). In humans this 
consists of 22 chromosome pairs and two sex chromosomes (XX for a female, XY for 
a male), giving a total of 46. One chromosome in each pair comes from the mother 
and one comes from the father. The 44 non-sex chromosomes are called autosomes; 
when arranged in approximate order of size, they are designated 1, 2, 3 to 22, with 
chromosome 1 being the largest (Figure 6.3f). Most cells carry two copies of each 
autosome and two sex chromosomes and are said to be diploid. Gametes are the 
exception to this; they have half the chromosome number and are said to be haploid. 
Each egg carries each of the 22 autosomes and a single chromosome X. Each sperm 
carries the 22 autosomes and either an X or a Y chromosome. So, during fertilisation, 
an egg fuses with a sperm to create a cell containing 22 pairs of autosomes and two sex 
chromosomes – the diploid number. If the sperm carries chromosome X, then the child 
will be female; if it carries chromosome Y, the child will be male.
Exons
The parts of genes 
that carry protein 
information.
Introns
DNA sequences 
within genes 
between exons.
Chromosome
A thread-like 
structure consisting 
of a long strand of 
DNA, carrying many 
genes, in a complex 
with protein.
Diploid
Having two sets of 
chromosomes, one 
from each parent.
Gametes
The sex cells: sperm 
in males, eggs in 
females.
Haploid
Having only one set 
of chromosomes. 
Usually applies to 
gametes.

is called the karyotype. (g) In the cell, the 46 chromosomes (f) are present in the nucleus, while the small circular 
mitochondrial DNA (e) is present in large numbers in the mitochondria. (h) A human adult contains in the order of 
1014 cells of about 200 different types

 
 
An important point here is that each autosome is present twice – one is a 
maternal chromosome, the other a paternal chromosome. For example, both 
chromosomes 1 carry the same set of genes, whether from the father or mother, but 
the form of each gene may be different; that is, they may be different alleles – this 
is very important and is discussed below in Sections 6.2.4–6.2.6. Note, though, that 
in males there is only a single Y chromosome and a single X chromosome; in males, 
these chromosomes are haploid.
 
The 46 chromosomes of the human karyotype contain a total length of DNA of 
about 2 m, which is packed into a microscopic cell nucleus, about 5m diameter, 
in each cell of the body (Figure 6.3g). As this DNA is located exclusively in the cell 
nucleus, it is referred to as nuclear DNA. 
 
Another distinct type of DNA is present in most cells. The cell organelle called 
the mitochondrion (Figure 6.3g), of which some cells have thousands, contains 
DNA called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Unlike nuclear DNA, which is linear 
and 107–108 bp long, mtDNA is a DNA circle that is very much smaller, being only 
16 569 bp long (Figure 6.3e). Also, unlike nuclear DNA, a child receives mtDNA only 
from its mother. Normally the father’s mtDNA is not present in the child. mtDNA 
has forensic uses, which are described in Section 6.5.
 
The human adult (Figure 6.3h) contains about 1014 (i.e. 100 trillion) cells. The 
majority of these are diploid and carry identical DNA. Exceptions are sperm and egg 
cells, which are haploid, and the red blood cells, which are unique in carrying no 
DNA. Any sample from a person that contains cells, intact or damaged, is a potential 
source of DNA for forensic analysis – DNA from any part of the person will usually 
generate the same profile. Exceptions are known; for example, people who have 
received a transplanted organ or bone marrow will produce a profile of the donor in 
tissue derived from the transplant; a sufferer of mouth cancer may produce a DNA 
profile from an oral sample different from one from other tissues; rare individuals, 
called chimaeras, who are made up of two genetically distinct groups of cells, may 
produce a different profile from different tissues. All of these interesting exceptions 
are considered to be rare.
6.2.4 Genetic differences: mutations and alleles
As discussed in Section 6.2.2, an alteration (mutation) in the DNA sequence of a 
gene can alter the encoded protein. Sometimes the alteration in the DNA results in 
a non-functional protein. If the protein is very important for the correct function of 
the cell or organism, then the result may be lethality or, if not so severe, a genetic 
disease. Sometimes the changes have only minor consequences, for example the 
gene for the ABO blood type. Alleles are variants of the DNA sequence of the gene. 
In a population, a gene can have many alleles (hundreds in some cases), but each 
individual carries only up to two alleles for a particular gene. This is because each 
gene is present in two copies, as each chromosome that carries the gene is present 
twice in a diploid cell, one copy from the mother and the other from the father 
(Section 6.2.3).
 
The position of a gene or sequence of DNA is called its locus. This is like 
a co-ordinate of the gene or section of DNA – it says on which chromosome it is 
present and where along that chromosome it is found. Just as a gene can have 
alleles, so a locus can be said to have alleles if there are variations of its DNA

sequence. Often, the term ‘locus’ (plural loci) is used rather than ‘gene’ because it 
can describe a region of a chromosome that might not be part of a gene (e.g. the 
intergenic DNA, Figure 6.3c).
 
Although each gene or locus is present twice, on each chromosome it can have 
a different allele. Heterozygous is the genetic term describing this state. The 
homozygous state is when the alleles are the same. 
 
Mutations in DNA that create new alleles can occur as a consequence of the 
presence of certain environmental factors, for example mutagenic chemicals, 
radioactivity and certain radiations. However, most mutations are introduced into 
the DNA by errors in the natural cellular processes of DNA replication and repair.
 
Various types of mutation are shown in Figure 6.4. Note that all the sequences in 
the figure are variations formed by mutation of the original sequence, and hence all 
these sequences are alleles of the same gene or sequence. Mutations can be small, 
altering a single base pair to another one, so-called point mutations (Figure 6.4a); 
these are indicated by asterisks. Insertion or deletion mutations add or remove base 
pairs to or from the sequence (Figure 6.4b). The size of insertion or deletion can 
be as small as a single base pair or as large as tens of thousands of base pairs. An 
important point here is that insertions increase the length of the DNA and deletions 
reduce it. Point mutations do not alter length. 
 
Figure 6.4c illustrates a type of sequence called a tandem repeat. Tandem here 
means ‘one after the other’: a sequence of DNA (CTAG in the example in Figure 
6.4c) is repeated several times, one following the other. The number of repeats can 
vary: the more repeats, the longer the DNA sequence. Figure 6.4c shows examples 
containing 2, 3, 8 and 11 repeats; these are all alleles of the sequence. In the 
example, the repeat CTAG is 4 bp long; repeats can be shorter or much longer than 
this.
 
Techniques employed to analyse DNA in forensic science (Section 6.3) depend 
on the separation of DNA molecules according to their length. Hence, alleles that 
differ in length, because they have an insertion or deletion or because the number 
of repeats is different, are easily analysed. Modern DNA profiling is based largely on 
the analysis of tandem repeats.
 
Terminology relating to tandem repeats is complex and is not always consistent 
among authors of different texts, but basically they are classified according to the 
length of the repeat:
n Short tandem repeats (STRs): the length of the repeat is short by definition, 
between 1 and 4 bp. These are extremely important in modern DNA profiling.
n Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs): the length of the repeat is not 
strictly defined but is often taken to be 6–100 bp.
n Satellite DNA: this is a general term referring to any type of tandem repetitive 
DNA.
n Microsatellite DNA: this has very short repeats of 2–4 bp (the repeat in Figure 
6.4c is a microsatellite); these are the same as STRs.
n Minisatellite DNA: this has repeat lengths of 6–100 bp and is often equated 
with VNTRs.
In Sections 6.3 and 6.4, we consider mainly STRs as they are the most widely used 
forensically.
Heterozygous
Having two different 
alleles for a given 
gene or sequence.
Homozygous
Having two 
identical alleles 
for a given gene or 
sequence.
Tandem repeat
A short sequence 
of DNA repeated 
consecutively a 
number of times. 
These repeats have 
important forensic 
applications.

6.2.5 DNA sequence variation among individuals
Genetically, individuals differ because they contain different combinations of alleles 
at some of the numerous, between 20 000 and 25 000, gene loci in the human 
genome. It is estimated that randomly selected individuals will differ in their 
DNA sequence at about a million positions. This large number corresponds to, on 
average, one difference every 1000 bp. Most of these will be point mutations, but all 
the types of mutation discussed above are represented. 
 
The word ‘mutation’ often carries negative connotations. If most mutations 
damaged genes, then the million or so DNA sequence differences between 
individuals might be thought to mean that most people will carry many deleterious 
mutations. However, work on the human genome has revealed that, surprisingly, 
most of the genome is not involved in coding for proteins – in other words, genes 
are only a small part of the genome (only about 1.5 per cent of DNA is involved 
in coding directly for proteins) (see Figure 6.3 and Section 6.2.3). This has led 
to the unscientific term ‘junk DNA’ for the parts of the genome whose function 
is unclear. Whether it is actually junk is a source of debate – it may have a role, 
but we do not know what it is; it clearly is not obviously to do with genes. More 
correct terms are ‘non-genic DNA’ and ‘non-coding DNA’. Most of the million DNA

differences between individuals will, purely by chance, fall into non-coding regions 
of the genome and so will not affect protein function. They are not, therefore, likely 
to have effects on the phenotype of the individual.
 
The importance of this for forensic work is that the ‘junk DNA’ can accumulate 
mutations that do not affect how well the organism can survive. For example, a 
mutation forming an allele that resulted in an altered protein leading to fatality 
in childhood would mean that the allele is unlikely to become very abundant in the 
population, as people with the mutation will die before they have children and the 
allele will be lost. Most serious genetic diseases are rare. Mutation in non-genic 
‘junk DNA’, however, will have no effect on the phenotype of the person, and the 
alteration can be passed on to his or her children. The mutation, an allele of the 
DNA region, is said to be selectively neutral because the survival of the individual 
carrying it is not compromised by its presence. 
 
In DNA profiling, the loci examined are thought to exhibit selective neutrality. 
The importance of this is that alleles can become abundant in the population; 
they are not so rare as to be of very limited use for forensic purposes. This may 
seem counter-intuitive: surely a rare allele would be highly characteristic of a given 
individual carrying it? This is true. However, because it is rare, most criminals will 
not have it and it will not be deposited at a crime scene. 
6.2.6 Inheritance of alleles
The types of mutation discussed in Sections 6.2.4 and 6.2.5 are inherited according 
to the standard rules of genetics. Figure 6.5 summarises the important points. In 
this example, a single region (locus) of a chromosome is being followed; this region 
has a number of alleles that differ in the number of repeats – the locus is an STR. 
For simplicity, only the chromosomes carrying the locus are shown (remember that 
there would be another 44 chromosomes in the cells). The father has three repeats 
on one chromosome and six repeats at the same locus on the other, and so he can 
be designated as having the genotype 3,6. Similarly, the mother has genotype 2,8. 
In the parents, the complex process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by 
half, producing the haploid number in the gametes. Each gamete has only one of 
each chromosome and hence only one allele of the STR. Hence, the father’s sperm 
will be a mixture of cells carrying the three-repeat allele or the six-repeat allele. 
The mother’s eggs will carry either a two- or an eight-repeat allele. At conception, 
the haploid sperm fuses with the haploid egg, producing the diploid fertilised egg, 
which can have one of four possible combinations of alleles, as shown; a given 
child will have one of these. This is all normal genetics, but note that genetics 
terms such as ‘dominance’ and ‘recessiveness’ are irrelevant in this case, as the 
phenotype is not being considered. All that matters is the combination of alleles in 
the individual.
 
As discussed, individuals differ at the level of DNA by containing different 
combinations of alleles at the numerous loci in the human genome. To study 
differences at the genetic level – the basis of DNA profiling – we need to be able to 
examine DNA and identify the alleles at certain loci that can be used to distinguish 
between people. The techniques that allow this are discussed in the next section.

In this example, the inheritance of the alleles of a single region (locus) of a chromosome is 
being followed. This region has a number of alleles that differ in the number of repeats; it is 
an STR. For simplicity, only the chromosomes carrying the locus are shown; remember that 
there would be another 44 chromosomes in the cells. The repeats do result in differences in 
chromosome length, but in the diagram this is greatly exaggerated; in reality, the difference is 
so small that the chromosomes would appear identical

 
6.3  Forensic DNA analysis and 
   
 DNA profiling 
From its origins in 1984, forensic DNA analysis has undergone rapid development, 
improving its precision, sensitivity and speed. In this section, the main techniques 
that underpin modern DNA profiling will be described. Readers interested in its 
historical development are referred to the website associated with this book. 
 
The forensic use of DNA samples begins with their collection from the crime or 
incident scene and ends with the presentation of the data at court or inquiry. As 
with the collection and storage of other evidence, strict procedures are adopted and 
must be followed rigidly in order for the evidence to be robust.
 
An outline of the procedure is as follows:
1. Collect and store evidence from the scene.
2. Extract DNA from the sample.
3. Quantify the DNA.
4. Amplify the genetic loci to be examined.
5. Separate the amplified DNA according to size using electrophoresis.
6. Interpret the pattern of alleles produced.
7. Compare one or more DNA samples for a match.
8. Present the data in the context of other evidence.
6.3.1 Collection and storage of DNA samples
General aspects of sample collection from a scene are dealt with elsewhere in this 
book, particularly in Chapter 2 (see, in particular, Section 2.4). In most respects, 
the collection of samples for DNA analysis is simply that of taking any biological 
samples. Blood and other tissue samples from unknown people are potentially 
hazardous (if, for example, sources are infected with hepatitis B, tuberculosis 
or HIV), and safety procedures must be followed. Another important issue is 
contamination: because the techniques of DNA analysis can detect very low amounts 
of material – as low as a single cell using certain methods – potential contamination 
by material from the Scenes of Crime Officers (SOCOs) must be avoided. Use of 
barrier clothing addresses these issues. An officer should wear a face mask and 
cover his or her hair when collecting DNA evidence. Material can be transmitted on 
gloves, so the officer must avoid touching his or her face while wearing gloves. Staff 
involved in the retrieval and processing of DNA evidence have their DNA profiles 
stored on an elimination database. DNA profiles from the scene are compared with 
the database to ensure that accidental contamination has not occurred.
 
DNA is a fairly stable molecule under a range of conditions. Correct storage is 
important to prevent degradation that could result in poor-quality profiles. How 
DNA is preserved depends on the nature of the evidence. Dry samples (e.g. hairs, or 
dried stains of blood or semen) can be stored at normal temperatures in paper bags, 
as these maintain the dryness of the material. Wet samples (e.g. clothing stains) 
 172 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
can be allowed to dry out naturally at normal temperatures or the samples can be 
frozen to prevent the degradation of the DNA by microbes and through breakdown 
by chemicals in the cell. Tissue samples from the scene and fresh reference samples 
from people involved or potentially involved in the incident (e.g. blood, mouth 
scrapes, oral, vaginal and rectal swabs) are frozen rapidly prior to DNA extraction.
 
Further to this, collection of control samples must be made. These are samples 
of the background material near the stain but untouched by it. The importance of 
this is to control for any contamination of the sample and to test whether there is 
anything in the background that might interfere with the DNA profile.
 
Forensic DNA analysis has become so sensitive that at the extreme a small 
bloodstain of about 3 mm2, a single hair with a good root or a used cigarette butt 
can give a DNA profile. Only about 1 ng (10–9 g) of DNA is required for an optimum 
DNA profiling result, but note that a modified procedure called LCN DNA profiling 
can produce profiles from less material than this (Section 6.6.1).
6.3.2 Extraction of DNA
Sources of DNA evidence cover a wide range of biological material. As discussed 
in Section 6.2, DNA is present in the nuclei and mitochondria of cells and so any 
sample of biological origin, containing cells, is a potential source of DNA. Table 6.1 
summarises potential sources of DNA. These sources are commonly found at crime 
scenes, but note that often the sources may be in combinations, for example in 
rape and sexual assault cases, and not separate as listed in the table. In a sample of 
mixed material, one source of DNA may be detected and the other not. 
 
Most internal organ tissues can be a source of DNA. Bone and tooth pulp contain 
DNA, which can survive a long time beyond that of many other tissues and have 
proved useful as DNA sources from old or badly decomposed bodies (Box 6.1). 
 
The method of extraction of DNA from the evidence depends on the particular 
sources; clearly a different procedure is needed to extract DNA from bone than from 
hair and blood. Generally, cellular material may be concentrated by centrifugation 
followed generally by agitation, to loosen cells into solution, and then the cells 
are broken open to release the DNA and other cellular components into solution. 
Subsequent steps remove the proteins, lipids and RNA, leaving a solution of DNA. If 
required, a further purification process can be included that removes contaminants 
that could interfere with the reactions involved in producing a DNA profile. For 
example, the blue dye in denim can inhibit the reactions, as can large amounts of 
haem and related compounds from blood samples. 
 
After extraction, the DNA is usually quantified to determine its concentration in 
order to ensure that the amount of DNA to be typed is a standard amount for optimal 
DNA profiling. The amount of DNA can be measured using the fluorescence of stained 
DNA or by estimating the depth of colour produced in a colorimetric reaction.
6.3.3 The polymerase chain reaction
Most modern DNA profiling is based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
DNA obtained by extraction of biological evidence (Section 6.3.2) is often present 
in insufficient amounts to detect or analyse it directly. PCR enables the specific 
generation of large amounts of the DNA of interest (in this context, short tandem

James Hanratty was hanged on 4 April 1962 for the 
so-called A6 murder, a notorious case of the early 1960s. 
In August 1961, an armed man forced Michael Gregsten 
and his lover Valerie Stone to drive from Dorney Reach 
in Berkshire along the A6 in Bedfordshire. On parking at 
a site called Deadman’s Hill, Michael Gregsten was shot 
twice in the back of the head, killing him. Valerie Stone 
was raped, shot five times and left for dead, although 
remarkably she survived. Various pieces of evidence 
led to James Hanratty being arrested, charged and 
ultimately convicted of the murder and rape. From his 
arrest to his death, James Hanratty strongly defended 
his innocence. Subsequently, his family have maintained 
that the case was a miscarriage of justice and over 
the years the case has attracted great scrutiny from 
legal experts, journalists and politicians. Innocence 
was argued on the basis of potential alibis that were 
found for James Hanratty, and the conduct of some 
of the police officers during the investigation was 
brought into question. A Court of Appeal for the case 
was granted in 1999. Application of DNA profiling had 
produced evidence from the underwear of Valerie Stone 
and a handkerchief that was found wrapped around the 
gun. A comparison of the profile with the DNA of James 
Hanratty’s relatives showed matches to the evidence. In 
March 2001, DNA from his exhumed body, from tooth 
pulp, also matched the evidence. In the Appeal, the 
DNA evidence carried great weight and the decision of 
the Court of Appeal was that the original conviction was 
safe. This judgment may be challenged on the argument 
that the DNA may be a result of contamination. At 
the time, long before DNA profiling, evidence was not 
necessarily collected and stored in such a way that 
cross-contamination would be avoided.

repeats – STRs) from the extracted DNA, to such a level as to allow them to be 
analysed by gel electrophoresis (Section 6.3.4).
 
Invented in 1983 by Kary Mullis, PCR has become one of the most powerful 
techniques of molecular genetics; its impact has been revolutionary. At its simplest, 
PCR is a means of amplifying or copying a particular region of DNA (forensically, 
this would be an STR locus of interest) to produce a large amount of it. It does this 
by mimicking DNA replication that occurs in cells prior to cell division. Only the 
genes/regions of interest are amplified (in this case, the STR loci); all other DNA 
present is ignored: this is called the specificity of the reaction. PCR is specific, fast 
and extremely sensitive.
 
Figure 6.6 outlines the basis of PCR. The primers are short sequences of DNA 
that are designed and synthesised to base pair to the ends of the region to be 
amplified; in this case, to unique sequences either side of the repeat sequence. 
Also attached to the primers are fluorescent molecules (tags), which allow the 
amplified DNA to be visualised in electrophoresis (see Section 6.3.4 and Figure 
6.7). Note that there are two primers needed per locus, and only the DNA between 
the primers is amplified. The reaction consists of temperature cycles conducted in 
a programmable heating block called a thermocycler. The first temperature, called 
the denaturation stage, of 95 ºC breaks the hydrogen bonds of the double helix; 
the DNA becomes single-stranded, exposing the bases in order that the primers can 
bind. Reducing the temperature to typically 50–60 ºC allows hydrogen bonds to 
reform, permitting the primers to base pair to the complementary sequences at the 
ends of the STR to be amplified. At 72 ºC the heat-stable enzyme Taq polymerase 
extends the primers, synthesising new DNA as it makes the two strands fully double-
stranded. At this point, the amount of target DNA has doubled. This is then put 
through another cycle of temperatures, resulting in a further doubling of the region 
of interest. Each cycle doubles the amount of target DNA, in this case an STR. A 
cycle may take 5 minutes and 30 cycles will give a 230 or about 109 increase in 
the amount of target DNA, so in 2.5 hours the DNA of interest has been increased 
in amount about a thousand million fold. This degree of amplification makes the 
methods very sensitive. At its absolute limit, a single DNA molecule can give an 
easily detectable amount of DNA in a few hours. This extreme sensitivity, though, 
does come at a price: very great care must be taken to avoid contamination with 
other material – the method, if carried out carelessly, is very sensitive to artefacts. 
 
As little as 0.2 ng of DNA or even that from a single cell (6 pg) can give a DNA 
profile based on PCR. Re-examination of old, stored evidence where the DNA may 
be degraded and present in very small amounts is possible only because of PCR. Box 
6.1 summarises a case where DNA data were generated from 40-year-old evidence. 
Subsequent boxes in this chapter all describe evidence generated by PCR.
 
In Figure 6.6b an example of PCR on an STR is shown. One allele has four 
repeats and the other has six repeats; hence, after the reaction, two fragments are 
produced, which when separated by gel electrophoresis (Section 6.3.4 and Figure 
6.7) produce the pattern shown in Figure 6.6b. When compared with the DNA 
standards, the genotype of the source is determined to be 4,6 for this STR. In this 
example, only a single genetic locus is being examined.
 
PCR is used for STR analysis and mitochondrial DNA analysis (Section 6.5) and 
hence underpins all modern forensic DNA analysis.

This figure shows the basics of the PCR reaction when being used to amplify a short tandem repeat (STR). (a) The 
primers, shown as short half-arrows, are designed to bind to the regions of DNA just outside the STR. The reaction 
is put through a series of temperature cycles, each with 95 °C, 50–60 °C and 72 °C stages. At each cycle, the amount of 
target DNA doubles. Thirty cycles will increase the amount of target DNA about 109 times. (b) The amplified STRs are 
then analysed using gel electrophoresis (see Section 6.3.4 and Figure 6.7) and compared with standards in order that 
the number of repeats can be estimated, the alleles for the STR identified and the genotype of the individual determined

 
6.3.4  Measuring the length of DNA molecules: gel 
electrophoresis
After the PCR described above, the amplified DNA fragments are analysed to 
determine the number of repeats present. This analysis is based on a technique 
called gel electrophoresis, which underpins almost all DNA analysis, forensic or 
otherwise. Gel electrophoresis separates DNA molecules according to their length 
and allows their measurement, usually in base pairs (bp). In the discussion of 
mutations and tandem repetitive DNA in Section 6.2.4, it was mentioned that STRs 
are often used in forensic DNA analysis and that the alleles of these STRs alter the 
length of the DNA. By measuring the length of DNA-containing STRs using gel 
electrophoresis, the number of repeats can be determined, ultimately establishing 
the genotype for an individual at that locus. 
 
Figure 6.7 summarises important aspects of gel electrophoresis. Figures 6.7a and 
6.7b illustrate a simple version of gel electrophoresis used to discuss its principles. 
In forensic DNA laboratories a variation of gel electrophoresis called capillary 
electrophoresis is used (Figure 6.7c); this is considered later in this section. The gel 
is moulded from a jelly-like material. For simple analyses a material called agarose 
is used, but for more precise work polyacrylamide or derivatives of this are used. In 
either case, the basis of the method is the same. DNA samples (generated by PCR) 
to be analysed are loaded into wells formed in the gel (Figure 6.7a). Not shown, for 
clarity, in Figure 6.7 is the buffer solution in which the gel is immersed. This buffer 
solution maintains the pH and carries the electric current. A voltage is applied 
across the gel, and because DNA carries a negative charge on its phosphate groups 
(Figure 6.2), it migrates towards the positive pole (the anode) and moves through 
the gel. The gel is a loose network of molecules that act like a molecular sieve. Long 
molecules of DNA have difficulty moving through the network as they frequently 
become caught in it, whereas shorter molecules migrate through the gel more 
rapidly. Hence, the DNA separates in the gel according to the size of the fragments; 
small fragments migrate faster than larger ones.
 
After the gel has run for an appropriate time, the DNA, which is not immediately 
visible, must be visualised. A common method for the type of gel electrophoresis 
shown in Figure 6.7b is to stain the gel with a dye called ethidium bromide, which 
binds to the DNA. Under ultraviolet light, the dye fluoresces orange and the DNA 
appears as bright-orange bands on the gel. A fluorescent dye allows very small 
amounts of DNA to be detected. Each band of DNA corresponds to a population of 
DNA molecules of all the same base pair length. 
 
The example in Figure 6.7 shows the analysis of an STR. Apart from the PCR-
amplified DNA samples from individuals A and B loaded into wells 1 and 2 
respectively, in lane 3 a set of known DNA size standards are loaded, effectively to 
calibrate the gel in order that the sizes of the DNA fragments from the individuals 
can be determined easily. In the example, the DNA standards are called an allelic 
ladder as each fragment represents a number of repeats at the locus, in other words 
its allele.
 
After staining the gel (Figure 6.7b), lane 1 shows two bands of DNA visible as 
does lane 2, although the sizes are different, since the DNA bands have migrated 
to different positions on the gel. Comparison of the bands in lanes 1 and 2 with 
the allelic ladder molecules in lane 3 allows numbers of repeats for the STR (its

Figure 6.7 Separating DNA molecules according to their length: gel electrophoresis
(a) DNA samples containing fragments of DNA are loaded into wells on the gel. In this example, the DNA fragments 
are from an STR, repeat mutation; sample A is from individual A with 2 and 6 repeats, and sample B is from 
individual B with 3 and 8 repeats. Also on the gel are loaded, into well 3, DNA standards of known size: this allows 
the size of unknown fragments to be determined by comparison. (b) Application of a voltage across the gel causes 
the DNA to migrate towards the anode and separate according to the length of the molecules. In the gel, the DNA is 
visualised by staining with coloured dyes that bind to it. The DNA appears as bands of colour: each band consists of 
a very large number of DNA molecules of the same length. (c) Capillary electrophoresis (CE): in modern methodology, 
the gel material is in a very fine capillary tube; the DNA is labelled by having fluorescent molecules (tags) attached 
to it during the PCR and is visualised when the laser, shone through a clear section of the capillary tube, causes the 
migrating DNA to fluoresce – this is detected by a CCD camera and the information passes to a computer. (d) Data 
from capillary electrophoresis are shown as an electropherogram. Note that the three samples shown would have

corresponding to a size of two repeats and the larger band is six repeats; for this 
STR locus, the genotype of individual A is 2,6, and so he or she is heterozygous. 
Similarly, individual B’s DNA in lane 2 has the genotype 3,8 for this locus, and so he 
or she is also heterozygous. 
 
The discussion above aims to give the general principles of gel electrophoresis, 
how DNA molecules are separated according to length and how the length can 
be determined using DNA size standards, allowing the allele of the STR to be 
established. The main modern separation technique used in forensic DNA analysis 
is capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE is a type of gel electrophoresis that gives great 
accuracy of measurement and also allows for automation. Figure 6.7c illustrates the 
principle of CE. The gel is contained in a fine capillary tube. DNA, which had been 
labelled with fluorescent molecules as part of the PCRs, migrates through the gel 
along the capillary towards the anode. Small DNA molecules migrate faster than 
longer molecules. At a certain point along the capillary, the DNA passes a fine laser 
beam, which excites the label and causes the DNA to fluoresce. A camera detects 
the fluorescence and the data are fed directly into software on a computer. Here 
the DNA bands appear on the computer screen as peaks on a graph, called an 
electropherogram (EPG) (Figure 6.7d; see also the example of a full DNA profile 
in Figure 6.1 and Plate 9). As in Figure 6.7b, the size of the peaks is determined 
by comparison with the standard DNA allelic ladder; here, the peaks confirm that 
individual A is of genotype 2,6 and that of individual B is 3,8. 
 
With CE, only one sample can be run on the capillary at a time; the 
electropherograms in Figure 6.7d would be from three separate runs. To ensure 
consistency and to enable the data from separate runs to be compared, internal 
DNA size standards are added to every sample before electrophoresis, but for 
clarity these are not shown in Figure 6.7c. Size standards are labelled with a red 
tag and cannot be confused with the DNA from the evidence. Figure 6.8d and the 
red panel in Plate 9 show the internal size standards, which are controls for any 
variation in the rate of migration between different runs on the capillary. This 
control is extremely important; for example, without it DNA from a crime scene 
might migrate slightly differently compared with that of the perpetrator who was 
the source of the evidence. Hence, the DNA evidence would not match, leading to 
his or her elimination as a potential suspect.
 
In forensic DNA laboratories, CE is carried out by a piece of equipment called 
a genetic analyser, which may have multiple capillaries, allowing simultaneous 
analysis of a number of samples. The genetic analyser also allows automation of 
the process; a large number of samples can be loaded onto it and the machine will 
work through them. For all its sophistication, though, at the heart of it is the fairly 
straightforward process of capillary gel electrophoresis.

6.3.5 Modern DNA profiling
In current practice, DNA profiling is based on the PCR amplification of a number of 
STR (microsatellite) loci. This approach has the following advantages over earlier 
methods:
n Application of PCR amplification of alleles increases the sensitivity of the 
technique and is also more rapid and simple to execute. 
n STRs are rather short alleles that are readily amplified by PCR, further 
increasing the sensitivity of detection (long sections of DNA generally do not 
amplify so well). Several loci can be examined in the same PCR.
n Simultaneous examination of several well-characterised loci in the 
same reaction allows for automation, improved resolution, improved 
standardisation and ease of comparison and assembly of DNA profile 
databases.
In the UK, the current standard profile is made using a system called AmpFl STR®SGM 
Plus™ (Applied Biosystems), hereafter referred to as SGM+, which was developed from 
a system of the Forensic Science Service of England and Wales. This system is not 
used throughout the world; other countries have systems that differ in the number 
of STR loci and the particular loci examined, although there is usually some overlap 
between the loci. The general principles are the same for all the systems.
 
In the SGM+ system, the extracted and quantified DNA (Section 6.3.2) is subject 
to PCR. In the simplest form of PCR (Section 6.3.3), two primers are used to amplify 
one locus (Figure 6.6). The SGM+ system, however, simultaneously amplifies 11 
different loci. Essentially, there are 11 PCRs taking place in the same tube; there 
are two specific primers for each of the 11 loci. A reaction containing several 
amplifications at once is said to be a multiplex PCR. The reason for examining 11 
loci is that it increases the discrimination of the analysis: the more loci that are 
examined, the less likely it is that two people will share the same combination of 
alleles (this point is discussed further in Section 6.4). After the PCR stage, the 
products of the reaction are separated according to size by CE (Section 6.3.4) and 
the data are presented as an electropherogram; this is the DNA profile.
 
Table 6.2 gives the names of the 11 loci amplified in the SGM+ system. Except 
for amelogenin, all the loci are STRs with a repeat length of 4 bp. For example, the 
repeat at the THO1 locus is the sequence AATG repeated many (up to 19) times. 
Loci vWA, THO1, FGA and amelogenin are genes; they encode proteins and are 
given the correct gene nomenclature. 
 
The loci beginning with ‘D’ are not parts of genes and are named according to 
rules for naming DNA segments. ‘D’ stands for DNA, and the number following 
indicates the chromosome on which the particular sequence is found. ‘S’ indicates 
a unique sequence and the number identifies the particular sequence. For example, 
locus D3S1358 is the unique DNA sequence (it is not found anywhere else in the 
genome) number 1358 on chromosome 3. 
 
Note that all 11 loci are on different chromosomes. This is to ensure that 
the alleles of a particular locus are inherited independently of the alleles of the 
other loci; in genetic terms, they are not linked. Without going into detail, this is 
important as linkage would complicate the analysis further. Most of the loci have a 
large number of alleles. 
 180 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
 
Alleles are generally named according to the number of repeats present in the 
STR. For example, for TH01, allele 5 consists of five repeats of the sequence AATG, 
while allele 6 consists of six repeats. In the case of a designation such as THO1 
allele 5.3, this means that there are five repeats but with an insertion of 3 bp; it is 
not a perfect simple repeat.
 
The amelogenin locus is not an STR and has two alleles. The gene, which 
encodes a protein in tooth pulp, is unusual in that it is present on both the X and 
Y chromosomes. Curiously, the gene on the Y chromosome is 6 bp longer than 
that on the X. This can, therefore, be used for determining the sex of the source 
of the DNA. A female source in the SGM+ system generates a PCR product from 
each X chromosome of 103 bp; this produces a single band in electrophoresis. From 
a male, the X chromosome still produces a 103 bp band but the Y chromosome 
produces a 109 bp fragment and so the profile will have two bands. The alleles of 
the amelogenin locus are, therefore, a strong indicator of the sex of the person who 
left the evidence. They are not an absolute indicator of sex, however, as there are 
a number of interesting but rare conditions in which the sex of a person is not in 
agreement with the combination of sex chromosomes.
 
At this point, we will discuss a DNA profile in detail. In Figure 6.1a, a DNA profile 
using the SGM+ system was shown as an introductory example. Figure 6.8 shows 
a profile generated by this system, but for clarity the profile has been split over 
four panels. On the electropherogram, each panel would appear as a different 
colour, which can be overlaid without confusion; in a single-colour representation, 
it is clearer to separate the colours into different panels. Plate 9 shows a full SGM+ 
profile in colour as it would appear on a computer screen.
 
The DNA profile consists of a series of peaks along a baseline. Each peak is a DNA 
molecule generated in the PCR amplification stage, and its position on the graph along 
the horizontal axis relates to the length of the DNA molecule. The shortest molecules

are to the left-hand edge of the panel. The lowest panel (Figure 6.8d) of 10 peaks 
shows the DNA molecular size standards that were added after the PCR. Each peak is 
labelled with its size in base pairs. Using these size standards, the size of the peaks in 
the other panels can be found with a high degree of precision. From the size of the PCR 
product (the peak), the particular locus being examined is clear and the particular 
alleles of that locus can be established. The nine labelled red peaks of Plate 9 are 
the size standards on this profile. As discussed in Section 6.3.4, these standards are

added to all samples before electrophoresis and are extremely important in allowing 
comparisons between different samples and ensuring consistency.
 
Figure 6.8a shows a set of eight strong peaks. On the computer screen these 
peaks appear blue, as the primers used to amplify them in PCR were labelled with 
a particular coloured fluorescent tag. The intelligent design of the PCR allows the 
separation of the four loci, as shown in this panel, and their alleles. The left-hand 
pair of peaks have sizes of 124 and 128 bp. From data tables for the SGM+ system, 
products of these sizes belong to the locus D3S1358 on chromosome 3. Further, 
the 124 bp product is generated by allele 15 of D3S1358 and the 128 bp product by 
allele 16. Hence, the genotype of the person at locus D3S1358 is 15,16. Remember 
that the loci being detected here are STRs, the alleles of which differ by the number 
of times the repeat is present (Section 6.2.4). Here, it can be seen that the repeat 
for D3S1358 is 4 bp long because allele 16 is 4 bp longer than allele 15.
 
The next pair of peaks have sizes of 183 bp and 187 bp, which according to the 
tables correspond to alleles 18 and 19 of the locus vWA; the genotype at vWA is 
therefore 18,19. The four loci of Figure 6.8a were labelled with a ‘blue’ fluorescent 
tag. These are shown in colour on Plate 9. On this plate, the grey bar over the peaks 
is the locus name and the range of size for the alleles of the locus. Figure 6.8b, and 
the equivalent section of Plate 9, shows the ‘green panel’; the loci were labelled 
with a ‘green’ fluorescent tag. As for the ‘blue’ panel, the size of each peak gives the 
corresponding allele. 
 
This type of analysis is continued for all the peaks on the electropherogram. 
Figure 6.8 shows the locus names and approximate range. Figure 6.1a shows the 
allele designations for this profile. The data from Figure 6.8 are summarised in 
Table 6.3, with data from Figure 6.1a. Firstly, using the amelogenin locus, the 
sex of the DNA source can be determined. The single peak of 103 bp in Figure 6.8 
indicates that the source was female. In Figure 6.1a, the two peaks of 103 and 109 
bp indicate a male. With regard to the other loci, the genotypes are all different, 
although some alleles of particular loci are in common, for example at D16S539 
both people carry allele 10, although the other alleles are different.
 
The designation of alleles can be carried out automatically. Computer programs 
identify the alleles and label them according to interpretation rules, which also 
remove artefact peaks and assess the quality of the profile. For commercial forensic 
laboratories, this means that hundreds of samples can be analysed in minutes. Plate 
9 is the result of such an analysis; the alleles at each locus have been identified 
and labelled. Note that there are some smaller peaks present, which the computer 
has ignored according to the interpretation criteria. In some instances, these peaks 
may be of significance and could be analysed. Also shown on Plate 9 are a number 
of grey stripes under each locus; these represent the expected sizes for each allele 
known for a given locus. If a peak falls in a grey stripe, it will be identified; if not, it 
may represent a new allele or an artefact.
 
Consistency and repeatability of DNA profiling is paramount in forensic work. 
Apart from the internal size controls added to each sample, another control called 
the allelic ladder is run separately. This consists of an artificial mixture of DNA 
fragments, containing nearly all known alleles of each of the 11 loci of SGM+. After 
electrophoresis, a complicated profile is produced (again in four colours), but with 
very many peaks (not a maximum of 22 from an individual). If the system is working 
FORENSIC DNA ANALYSIS AND DNA PROFILING n 183

 
correctly, all the peaks should be identified correctly as their corresponding, 
known alleles. 
 
DNA profiles such as Plate 9 and Figures 6.8 and 6.1a and their associated 
genotypes (Table 6.3) are readily isolated from suspects and from biological 
evidence at crime scenes. A match of evidence and suspect links the suspect to the 
scene extremely strongly. 
6.3.6 The National DNA Database
A major advantage of modern DNA profiling is that the data generated can be 
readily presented and collected in databases that can be searched with new DNA 
evidence from a crime scene. In April 1995 the Forensic Science Service (FSS) of 
England and Wales set up the National DNA Database™(NDNAD), the first database 
of its kind in the world. Many countries now have or are starting to develop such 
databases; in the United States, the FBI Laboratories are responsible for a database 
called the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). 
 
NDNAD is a collection of DNA profiles from unsolved scene of crime evidence 
and DNA profiles from suspects and convicted criminals. Based on 2009 data, there 
are over 4.8 million personal profiles (about 7 per cent of the UK population) on 
the database, as well as about 350 000 profiles from evidence at crime scenes. 
Typically, DNA evidence from a crime scene will be used to interrogate the database 
to identify a potential source of that profile. It can also compare the evidence with 
that from other crimes and perhaps link incidents to a common person. 
 
In the UK, non-intimate samples (buccal cells from a mouth scrape or hairs with 
roots) for DNA profiling can be taken from people charged or reported for recordable 
offences and now, through new legislation, from volunteers who wish their DNA to be 
retained. Famously, former prime minister Tony Blair provided a voluntary sample 
for the database, to which his profile is now a permanent addition. Initially, profiles 
of people found innocent were deleted from the database, but following a change in 
the law from April 2005, in England and Wales reference DNA samples from suspects

who are not charged could be preserved indefinitely and used as evidence in any and 
all cases. However, the legality of retaining the DNA of innocent individuals has been 
brought into question. S, a juvenile acquitted of attempted robbery, and M. Marper, 
who had a charge of harassment against him dropped, tried to have their DNA records 
removed from the database. This ultimately led to the European Court of Human 
Rights ruling on S and Marper vs. The United Kingdom in December 2008 that the 
policy of retaining DNA information about innocent people contravened the European 
Charter of Human Rights. A proposed change in the law with regard to the retention 
of DNA profiles is to be debated and voted on in 2011 in the UK government’s 
response to this judgement and to concerns from other groups (see Section 6.6.6.)
 
The database matches of a suspect to a crime scene along with supporting non-
DNA evidence can now be used to charge the suspect with the crime, leading to legal 
proceedings. A recent demonstration of the power of database analysis is described in 
Box 6.2, but numerous other examples could be given. NDNAD is fundamental to all 
DNA profiling work in forensic science. There is more to interpreting DNA profiles than 
simply identifying matches, and this is discussed in Section 6.4.
A dramatic example of the use of the NDNAD relates to 
the rape and murder of three 16-year-old girls in 1973 in 
the Neath area of South Wales, UK. The body of Sandra 
Newton was found in a ditch at Tonmawr in June; Pauline 
Floyd’s and Geraldine Hughes’ bodies were found in 
woodland at Llandarcy in September. At the time there 
was no evidence to identify the killer. With the improved 
technology of Low Copy Number DNA (Section 6.6.1), a 
profile from 28-year-old clothing evidence was obtained 
and used to search the database. No match was found; 
the killer’s DNA was not on the database. A novel search 
of the database was then employed. Instead of looking 
for perfect matches, the search revealed profiles with 
some similarities to the DNA evidence from the bodies, 
with the intention of identifying potential relatives of 
the murderer. About 100 candidates were identified 
with the search. With this information and existing 
intelligence from the South Wales Police, a relative of 
the probable killer was identified (it was fortunate the 
relative’s profile was on the database) and this led to a 
strong suspect, Joseph William Kappen, who had died of 
lung cancer in 1991. DNA samples from other relatives 
confirmed their similarities to the DNA profile from 
the evidence, resulting in the exhumation of Joseph 
Kappen’s body in May 2002. The DNA profile from the 
body matched that of the evidence from the girls’ bodies. 
In the absence of a trial, it cannot be said conclusively 
that Kappen was guilty of the three murders, but the 
case is now closed.
 
In March 2003, a brick thrown from a footbridge 
over the M3 motorway crashed through the windscreen 
of a lorry. It struck the driver Michael Little on his 
chest, causing heart failure and killing him. Partial DNA 
evidence from the brick and other complete DNA evidence 
from a nearby attempted car theft did not match profiles 
on the DNA database. Familial searching was carried out 
on the database, producing 25 possible relatives of the 
person whose DNA was found on the brick and the car. 
Discovery of a close relative led to the identification of 
Craig Harman, who was convicted of the manslaughter 
of Michael Little in 2004. This is the first case where 
familial searching led to a prosecution.

6.4 Interpretation of DNA profiles
Clearly the two profiles in Table 6.3 do not match. If the data in Figure 6.8 were 
evidence at a crime scene and the profile in Figure 6.1a was a potential source, 
then it is easy to exclude the individual. There is a very important point here: DNA 
evidence can be exclusive – it can absolutely discount a person as being the source 
if the profiles display differences. 
 
Suppose, however, that the DNA profiles of evidence (Figure 6.8) and suspect 
appear identical. Neglecting accidental contamination, then the obvious conclusion 
is that the suspect is the source. However, if the profile shown is fairly common 
in the population, the match could be coincidence and the conclusion may not be 
valid. Modern DNA profiling attempts to determine the chance that two people 
will share the same profile; that is, it tries to approach individuality for the profile, 
improving the confidence in the conclusion that there is extremely strong support 
that the suspect was the source if a match is shown with the evidence. Remember, 
though, that DNA evidence cannot conclusively identify its source as the perpetrator 
of a crime; in the legal system, it is the jury that decide.
 
To address how common a particular profile is in a population requires the 
application of some principles of population genetics. Before tackling the full 
profile of Figure 6.8, it is useful to consider a simple case. 
6.4.1 Single-locus data: simple population genetics
Figure 6.7c shows a study using PCR amplification of a single STR locus on two 
suspects. Individual A (lane 1) has a genotype of 2,6, and individual B (lane 2) has a 
genotype of 3,8. If, from a crime scene, DNA evidence of genotype 3,8 is found, what 
relevance does this have regarding the suspects? Firstly, suspect A can be excluded 
absolutely as the source, as he or she does not have either of the alleles present in 
the evidence. Suspect B carries both alleles that are found in the evidence, 3 and 
8. Does this mean that he or she is the source of the evidence? Not necessarily – 
if there is other evidence such that only A or B can be the source, then the DNA 
evidence indicates it must be B. However, if the source could be anybody in the 
population, then how likely is it that B was the source? The source must have the 
genotype 3,8, and so it depends how common this genotype is in the population: if 
it is a very rare combination, then this is supportive of B being the source but not 
necessarily proof. If 3,8 is a very common genotype, then it is meaningless with 
regard to the guilt of B. 
 
To try to resolve this issue, we need to know how common the genotype 3,8 is 
in the population. This can be found only by experiment, isolating the DNA from 
many individuals and genotyping them for the STR of interest. These data give a 
table of allele frequencies, that is how common certain alleles are in the population. 
For example, Table 6.4 shows allele frequencies for the STR discussed above. Here, 
the 2 repeat allele has a frequency of 0.36, which means that out of 100 alleles 
(from 50 people, as each person carries two alleles) sampled randomly, 36 would 
be expected to be the 2 repeat. The maximum value is 1.00, in which case no other 
alleles are present. The lowest value is 0; in other words, the allele is not found in 
the population. In Table 6.4, alleles of 1, 5 and 7 repeats are not found, and so their 
allele frequencies are 0. Note that the sum of all the allele frequencies is 1.00.
 186 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
 
Table 6.4 still does not tell us how frequent the genotype 3,8 is in the population. 
To estimate this requires the use of one of the basic theorems of population genetics 
– the Hardy–Weinberg principle. This describes a mathematical relationship 
between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies. The simplest case considers 
a gene or STR with two alleles, P and Q, with respective allele frequencies p and q. 
If certain conditions are met or assumed, then the Hardy–Weinberg principle states 
that the genotype frequencies will be (p + q)2 = p2 + 2pq + q2 where p2 is the 
frequency of the homozygous genotype PP, q2 is the frequency of the homozygous 
genotype QQ and 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype PQ.
 
This can be extended to any number of alleles for a given locus, as in Table 6.5, 
which, although it appears very complicated, has a simplicity to it. The frequency 
of a particular homozygote is the particular allele frequency squared. For a given 
heterozygote, its expected frequency is two times the product of the two allele 
frequencies.
 
Using the data from Table 6.4, we can now address how common the genotype 
3,8 is expected to be in the population. From Table 6.4, the frequency of allele 3 
repeats (p) is 0.01 and that of 8 repeats (q) is 0.15. Applying the Hardy–Weinberg 
principle, the expected frequency of the 3,8 heterozygote is 2pq or 2 × 0.01 × 0.15 
= 0.003. This means that three people in a thousand would be expected by chance 
to have the 3,8 genotype. This seems a low chance, but it is not proof that individual 
B is the source if many other people could have been. If only a limited number of 
people could have been the source and B is the only one with genotype 3,8, then the 
evidence is stronger.

INTERPRETATION OF DNA PROFILES n 187

 
6.4.2 Interpreting full, multiloci DNA profiles
Using the Hardy–Weinberg principle outlined previously, the profile of Figure 6.8 
can be analysed using data from tables of allele frequencies for the loci in the SGM+ 
system. Basically, the expected genotype frequency for each locus is calculated as 
above. This generates Table 6.6. The allele frequencies shown are obtained from 
tables of population data for the loci. There is a range of genotype frequencies. That 
for D19S433 is expected to be found in only 4 out of 1000. For D3S1358, D8S1179 
and THO1, 123 people in 1000, or more than 1 in 10, can be expected to have the 
particular genotype. Individually, these genotypes are not very discriminating.
 
These values show how common the observed genotype of the particular locus 
is expected to be in the population. To estimate how common the entire profile is 
likely to be, the genotype frequencies for all the loci are simply multiplied together. 
This is valid because the loci are all on different chromosomes and the inheritance 
of one genotype has no influence on the inheritance of other alleles at different loci. 
 
Hence, for the profile in Figure 6.8, its frequency in the population is expected 
to be 0.123 × 0.057 × 0.024 × 0.029 × 0.123 × 0.067 × 0.042 × 0.004 × 0.123 
× 0.020 = 1.66 × 10–14. This represents a remarkably low frequency. The chance 
that two unrelated people selected at random would have the same profile (the 
probability of identity) is 1/(1.66 × 10–14) = 6 × 1013; this is also called the match 
probability. Effectively, this means that one person in 6 × 1013 would be expected 
to have the profile. The match probability in this case greatly exceeds the population 
of the Earth. Such impressively large numbers must be treated with some caution, 
however. The statistics do not consider relatives in the population. As discussed 
below in Sections 6.4.3 and 6.4.4, relatives are much more likely than non-relatives 
to share alleles and hence the likelihood of a profile match between relatives is 
greater. Also, the profile of everyone on the Earth is not known and although it may 
be statistically unlikely that two people could share the same profile, it does not 
prove the profile is unique. 
 
These data related to the profile in Figure 6.8 can also be presented as a 
likelihood ratio, where the probabilities of alternative events are compared. In

this case, with the DNA profile evidence observed, one hypothesis, which would 
be the prosecution argument, is that the suspect left the evidence and that is why 
the profiles match. If the hypothesis is true, then the probability for this match 
is 1.0. The alternative possibility is that the evidence is from another person, the 
defence case. This probability from the STR data is 1.66 × 10–14. The likelihood 
ratio is thus equal to 1/(1.66 × 10–14) = 6 × 1013, which has the same value as the 
match probability, but its meaning is different; it means that the hypothesis that 
the evidence originated from the suspect is 6 × 1013 times more likely than the 
alternative. (For more on likelihood ratios, see Chapter 13, Section 13.6.)
 
The reason for using 10 loci is that even though each individual locus is not very 
discriminating, as some of their alleles are very common, the whole profile becomes 
very discriminating because of the multiplication of many low probabilities. Hence, 
it is more likely, but not certain, that the profile is found only in the source 
individual. For several reasons discussed in Section 6.4.4, the probability calculated 
may be an underestimate, but the system is still very powerful in its resolution.
6.4.3 DNA profiling in paternity testing
DNA profiling has an important use in paternity testing and, more broadly, 
establishing familial relationships among a group of people. A wide variety of 
issues revolve around familial relationships; where these might be in question, for 
whatever circumstances, DNA profiling is a powerful tool allowing their resolution. 
Cases are often civil, but there are also applications in criminal cases; for example, 
a body may be identified as that of a missing child by comparing its DNA profile 
with that of the parents. 
 
The inheritance of alleles follows the basic pattern of inheritance discussed in 
Section 6.2.6 and Figure 6.5. A child can receive only one of the father’s alleles and 
one of the mother’s alleles. By looking at the DNA profiles of mother, father and 
child, there should be a clear relationship. 
 
Table 6.7 gives summarised profile data for a hypothetical paternity case where 
there are two alleged fathers. Comparing the daughter’s genotypes for each locus 
with those of the mother and the alleged fathers allows a decision to be made. 
Consider just locus D3S1358, where the child has genotype 16,17. Allele 16 must be 
from the mother as neither alleged father has this allele. Allele 17 of the child must 
be from the father, and only alleged father 2 has allele 17. This effectively excludes 
alleged father 1 as being the father. Applying the same analysis for all the other loci 
confirms this. For each allele that is not maternal in origin, alleged father 2 can be 
the source and so the evidence favours alleged father 2 as being the father. 
 
As discussed above, however, this is not necessarily proof of paternity; it depends 
on how common the alleles donated by the father are in the population. For 
reporting evidence, a statistic called the combined paternity index is calculated. 
For the data above, this has a value of about 540 000, which means that it is 540 000 
times more likely that father 2 is the father than a random male in the population. 
This statistic is rather unwieldy and is often converted to the probability of paternity 
(PrP). The closer this value is to 1, the more certain is paternity. The data in Table 
6.7 gives a PrP value of 0.999 98, very strongly supporting the hypothesis of the 
paternity of father 2. The calculation of these statistics is beyond the scope of the 
chapter; extension information is available on the accompanying website.
INTERPRETATION OF DNA PROFILES n 189

 
 
Statistical analysis sounds very convoluted and becomes more complicated 
than perhaps the initial matching of maternal and paternal alleles would seem to 
warrant. In paternity, clearly other evidence of associations and sexual relationships 
would be relevant. The use of statistics attempts to introduce objectivity into the 
interpretation of the DNA profiles.
6.4.4 Familial testing
Just as parents and their children can be identified by DNA profiling because of the 
pattern of shared alleles as described above (Section 6.4.3), so other relatives are 
also expected to share some of their alleles. DNA profiles from relatives are likely to 
show a higher proportion of shared alleles than unrelated people. Non-relatives may 
share alleles in a profile, as described above (Sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2). Some alleles 
are very common in the population and hence are likely to be shared, but this is 
by chance and not by genetic descent. The more distant the relatives, the fewer 
alleles expected to be shared by them and the lower the confidence in establishing 
relatedness using DNA profiling. The use of more loci in DNA profiling would allow 
greater reliability in establishing distant relatedness.
 
Using DNA profiling to identify relatives is proving a powerful application of the 
NDNAD by the police. As described earlier (Section 6.3.6), DNA profile evidence 
from an incident or crime scene is compared with all the profiles in the NDNAD with 
the intention of finding a match over the whole profile. The success of this depends 
on the profile of the source individual being on the database. If this was not the 
case, the DNA evidence could lead nowhere. However, by searching the database for 
profiles that share a higher proportion of alleles with the evidence, relatives of the 
source may be identified; this is then intelligence for the police investigation and 
may lead to the individual who left the evidence. In familial searching, where only 
partial matches are being searched for, it is expected that a fairly large number of

profiles in the database might meet the criteria. This does not mean that all these 
profiles are from relatives to the source individual; some will be partial matches by 
chance. Other evidence related to the incident will eliminate many of the chance 
matches, and ultimately a true relative may be found and lead to the actual source 
of the evidence. This is a use of the database beyond searching for simple matches. 
The first high-profile example of familial searching was the cold case review that led 
to Joseph Kappen described in Box 6.2. Familial searching first led to a conviction 
in the case of Craig Harman, jailed for manslaughter in 2004 (Box 6.2).
6.4.5  Quality control and complications in DNA profile 
data
From the earliest days of DNA evidence being presented in court, it has been put 
under intense scrutiny. DNA evidence has been dismissed on highly technical 
grounds related to conduct in the laboratory. A DNA profile must be produced 
according to quality assurance systems, from the collection to presentation of DNA 
evidence, aimed at ensuring data are robust enough in order to withstand the rigour 
of courtroom challenges. 
 
The following are examples of conduct related to quality management:
n At every stage of processing, the track of the evidence is documented to 
ensure continuity of evidence is maintained. 
n Throughout the procedures, great care is taken to avoid contamination 
because of the great sensitivity of PCR-based techniques.
n Positive and negative controls are included in the tests. 
n Attributing peaks on the electropherograms to alleles requires accurate 
sizing and must be controlled carefully. 
n Objective standards for analysing the data are employed. 
n Laboratories undertaking the work carry out trials, both declared and blind, 
to test the systems and are subject to inspections by standard monitoring 
organisations.
The DNA profiles discussed in Section 6.4.2 are full profiles because information is 
obtained for all 11 loci. In practice, the quality of the profile may be compromised 
by the quality and quantity of the DNA from the scene of crime evidence. Hence, 
interpreting a profile may not be so straightforward as described previously: 
n Partial profiles: these occur when not all alleles amplify, and a full DNA 
profile is not obtained. They are often encountered when the DNA evidence is 
badly degraded or is found in very low amounts (see Low Copy Number DNA, 
Section 6.6.1). Interpretation may still be possible based on the successful 
amplifications, but the discriminating power may not be so high, as fewer 
matches can be observed. Having fewer matching peaks reduces the match 
probability, with consequent impact on the strength of the DNA evidence.
n Mixed profiles: in these cases, the extracted DNA is from two or more people. 
Bloodstains in assaults may be from more than one person. In the case of rape, 
evidence may contain the DNA of the victim and the perpetrator. The mixed 
INTERPRETATION OF DNA PROFILES n 191

 
profile can be compared with that of the victim and, by subtraction, a profile 
of the rapist made, although this may not be complete. Sperm in semen can 
be separated from cells of the victim, thereby increasing the proportion of 
the sample’s DNA originating from the rapist. Multiple rape may give mixed 
profiles that are very complex but that can still be unravelled, depending on 
other evidence. Commonly, the victim has a partner whose DNA is also present 
in the mixture. Mixed profiles are apparent by there being more than two 
alleles for some, although not necessarily all, of the loci. Mixed profiles can 
be a challenge to interpret, and it may be best not to use them as evidence 
if they can be avoided; however, they may be the only evidence. The problem 
of mixed profiles is considered in Figure 6.9, which for simplicity considers 
two contributors (A and B), and the alleles of just one locus; remember that 
in a full SGM+ profile another nine loci would be present. When the peak 
heights are similar (Figure 6.9b, c) there are no criteria by which the alleles 
can be paired to give the genotypes of the contributors to the mixed profile. 
Hence, a set of possible genotypes can be made but the true genotypes of the 
contributors cannot be determined. From a mixed profile at all 10 STR loci of 
SGM+, the number of possible permutations of the genotypes is large. A pilot 
study in four UK police forces, of a computer-based analysis called DNAboost 
that attempts to interpret mixed profiles, has been declared ‘fit for purpose’ 
for wider use by all forces (see Section 6.6.2).
 
Analysing and interpreting DNA profile data as described in Sections 6.4.1 and 
6.4.2 uses the Hardy–Weinberg principle. This principle is of great importance in 
population genetics but is founded on some assumptions. The relevant assumptions 
here are:
n mating is random within the population;
n the mating population is large;
n mating between closely related individuals does not occur;
n there is no immigration into or emigration out of the population.
 
The assumptions are unlikely to be met in real human populations: populations 
on islands and in remote regions may be quite small; migration has occurred widely 
throughout history and is very important today; and within populations mating is 
not random, as people often tend to have children with partners from the same 
social class and racial or cultural groups.
 
A consequence of this is that alleles do not flow freely in the population and 
groups may differ in the alleles they contain or show certain alleles at different 
frequencies to other groups. If an allele occurs in one group, it will remain 
within that group unless matings take place with members outside the group. In 
multicultural and multiracial societies such as the UK, much of Europe and the 
United States, the populations are not uniform for allele frequencies. Data are 
available for subgroups in the population. The DNA profile in Section 6.4.2 was 
analysed using US Caucasian allele frequencies. In the UK, the racial groups usually 
considered are: White European, Afro-Caribbean, Indian Subcontinental, South-East 
Asian and Middle Eastern. Clearly, these are very broad groups and within them are 
likely to be further subpopulations. Assigning populations to groups is not without

problems and is not always consistent between different countries. The populations 
of Spanish and Southern European origin in the United States are grouped as 
Hispanics for a subset of allele frequencies. The original populations in Europe are 
classified in the general Caucasian group.
 
Families have more genes and alleles in common with each other than with the 
unrelated population. This has a bearing on DNA profile interpretation. If close 
relatives could be the source of evidence, then the discrimination of the profiling

Figure 6.9 A mixed profile at a single locus
Mixed profiles are manifest by there being more than two alleles present for a given locus on 
the electropherogram. For simplicity, here a single locus is shown but note that the pattern of 
there being more than two alleles is likely to be repeated at each locus in the profile. (a) Four 
alleles of 14, 15, 18 and 20 repeats are shown at this locus, and therefore it is likely that there 
are two contributors to the DNA mixture. Alleles 15 and 18 have similar peak heights and, since 
peak height is related to the amount of DNA, it is probable that the genotype of one contributor, 
the major one, was 15,18. The other, minor contributor was probably 14,20. The difference in 
peak height allows the separation of the profiles with some confidence. (b) This diagram shows 
the same alleles as in (a), but here the peak heights are similar and the genotypes cannot be 
separated. There are a number of possibilities for the genotypes of the two contributors, known 
here as A and B. (c) Three alleles are shown and the peak height of 15 is greater than the other 
two. Here a 15,15 homozygote is possible, or both contributors could carry allele 15

is different, as we are considering not random population members but a family 
population. The extremely high discrimination of the SGM+ system does allow 
resolution of individuals (except for identical twins) and the likelihood ratios and 
other evidence favour one conclusion over others. For example, a suspect may claim 
that he is not the source of the matching DNA evidence and that the evidence is his 
brother’s. The likelihood that two siblings could have an identical SGM+ profile is in 
the order of 1 in 10 000 (note the much lower discrimination value here compared 
with the match probabilities in Section 6.4.2, which assume unrelated people). Even 
if the brother refuses to provide a sample for DNA analysis and elimination, the 1 in 
10 000 match probability argues strongly that the source was the original suspect.
 
That the assumptions of the Hardy–Weinberg principle are not met fully does 
not negate analyses carried out using it; it can be considered as presenting the 
simplest ideal case upon which complicating factors can be introduced. Population 
substructures and inbreeding have predictable consequences, which with sufficient 
data can be taken into account when interpreting the DNA profile. Detailed 
treatment of these factors is beyond the scope of this chapter. 
 
Although it is straightforward to calculate a match probability, as described in 
Section 6.4.2, the points discussed above, about assumptions in the analysis, do 
question the accuracy of the value. Is it really, say, 6 × 1013? This is difficult to 
address, and in the UK the value usually quoted in court for full matching SGM+ 
DNA profiles is one in a billion (1 in 109). This is clearly a conservative estimate 
compared with the calculated match probability, but it is considered not to over-
estimate the statistical significance of the match. In other countries, the full value 
of the match probability may be quoted.
6.4.6 Y chromosome analysis
The DNA profiles considered above are based on the analysis of STRs present on 
autosomes (Table 6.2). The only marker on the sex chromosomes is amelogenin. 
Only males (usually) carry a Y chromosome. As the greater proportion of serious 
crime is carried out by men, there is an interest in examining DNA found only in 
this gender. The Y chromosome is a small chromosome with few genes; unlike 
other chromosomes, it does not have a homologue (see Section 6.2.3) and is not 
subject to the processes of recombination that assort the alleles on the autosomes, 
generating new combinations. A Y chromosome is altered only by the process of 
mutation, which is infrequent. Numerous (over 200) STRs are present on the Y 
chromosome and multiplex PCR systems are available to analyse some of these; one 
system, Yfiler™ of Applied Biosystems, allows the determination of the alleles and 
number of repeats present at 16 loci on the Y chromosome. A DNA profile produced 
by such an analysis would superficially resemble an SGM+ profile, but more careful 
examination would show that at most loci only a single allele is present (an 
exception is the locus DYS385 which is duplicated on the Y chromosome and can 
produce two peaks); this is because the Y chromosome is present only once in a 
cell. A Yfiler profile hence would consist of up to 17 peaks, and the genotype would 
consist of a column of numbers, one for the repeat number (allele) at each locus. 
 
Since the Y chromosome cannot recombine, a father’s combination of alleles 
(his haplotype, since the Y chromosome is haploid) is expected to be passed to his 
sons unaltered (unless mutation occurs), and they will then pass on the haplotype, 
 194 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
unchanged, to their sons down the paternal line. A Y chromosome is not expected 
to be unique to an individual: his father, paternal grandfather, brothers and sons 
will all share the same Y chromosome alleles, unless mutation has altered some. 
The discrimination of Y chromosome analysis is low compared with STR profiling 
on autosomes; a match probability of about 0.003 might be expected for 11 Y 
chromosome STRs. Note that as Y chromosomes are haploid, they cannot recombine 
or show independent assortment, and the approach used to calculate expected 
genotype frequencies for SGM+ profiles in Sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 is not appropriate.
 
In many cultures, the surname is passed down the paternal line and hence should 
follow the Y chromosome. This has led to the suggestion that a given pattern of 
Y chromosome alleles might be associated with a surname. Imagine a forensic 
scientist examining DNA evidence and being able to give the surname of the source. 
The principle has been demonstrated with some names, but for general application 
it is probably rather far-fetched, certainly for common surnames with multiple 
origins. Illegitimacy and cases where the accepted father is not the biological father 
may complicate paternal lines.
 
In mixed profiles from males and females, Y chromosome analysis provides genetic 
links solely to the male. In multiple rape, a mixed Y chromosome profile might be 
easier to separate into its components and link to suspects than autosomal STR data.
 
Y chromosome analysis has been exploited widely in studies of human populations 
and migrations. Its application to forensic work is a topic of discussion. It has been 
used in special circumstances but is not used routinely. There have been proposals 
for a Y chromosome STR database for the UK but this is not yet seen as an immediate 
strategic issue as these profiles are not generated in large numbers in the UK.
6.4.7 Summary
Sections 6.3 and 6.4 have covered the basis of modern DNA profiling, describing 
the techniques of DNA analysis and their application to the study of STRs, currently 
the most powerful type of forensic DNA analysis. The SGM+ system has been used 
as an example of a system of multiplex PCR-based STR analysis, and the nature of 
the data generated and its basic interpretation has been considered. Further, the 
application of STR analysis to the Y chromosome and its potential was covered. The 
impact of the technology on forensic science has been revolutionary.
6.5  Analysis not involving STRs: single- 
  
 nucleotide polymorphism analysis
Standard DNA profiling as described above is currently based on STR analysis. There 
are a large number of STR loci in the human genome; they have large numbers of 
alleles and, because alleles differ in the number of repeats, the length of each allele 
differs. It is relatively easy to measure the length of DNA molecules, and hence the 
analysis of STR loci is straightforward. However, as described in Section 6.2.4, there 
are other types of variable DNA in the human genome. Indeed, it was mentioned 
that the majority of mutations in the human genome are point mutations, namely 
single base changes. Ninety per cent of human genetic variation is in the form of 
ANALYSIS NOT INVOLVING STRS: SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS n 195

 
point mutations, and such mutations are very abundant. If a particular base (at a 
precise location in the human genome) can be more than one of the four bases (A, 
C, G or T, or a subset of these), it is said to be a single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP). An SNP can be found every 100–300 bp throughout the human genome, 
which hence contains literally millions of SNPs. A change of base from, say, A to G 
does not alter the length of the DNA, and determining which base is present at an 
SNP needs techniques in addition to those used in STR analysis. This section covers 
one approach to SNP analysis and considers forensic applications in the context 
of mitochondrial DNA analysis. Further applications related to predicting physical 
appearance are considered in Section 6.6.5.
6.5.1 Analysis of SNPs
A given SNP can have a maximum of four alleles: it can be A, C, G or T. Many SNPs 
have only two alleles, A or G for example. Compare this with the number of alleles 
for STR loci in Table 6.2. To determine the allele of a given SNP, the particular 
base present has to be established. The technique used to do this is called DNA 
sequencing, one of the most important procedures in genetics.
 
DNA sequencing allows the precise base sequence (Section 6.2.2) of a section of 
DNA to be determined. All mutations and different alleles are initially characterised 
using DNA sequencing, which is capable of revealing all types of mutation. This 
is a complex but important technique that was, until fairly recently, technically 
demanding. For routine analysis, however, DNA sequencing is usually avoided, and 
assays are developed that are simpler and can be automated, for example SGM+ for 
STR analysis. DNA sequencing is not used routinely in forensic science. Its main 
forensic use is for mtDNA analysis, where it is needed to reveal point mutations. 
The interested reader is directed to books listed at the end of this chapter, as it 
is inappropriate to cover the technique in detail here. However, DNA sequencing 
has and is undergoing rapid technological development; it is becoming easier and 
cheaper to sequence large amounts of DNA (see Section 6.6.7).
 
For routine analysis of SNPs, a much simplified version of DNA sequencing, called 
minisequencing, was developed. This method is illustrated in Figure 6.10. The aim is 
to establish which base is present at the SNP site (Figure 6.10a). A primer is made 
that is complementary to the sequence next to the SNP. After allowing the primer 
to base-pair to the target sequence (Figure 6.10b), the DNA is incubated in the 
presence of DNA polymerase and four modified nucleotides (Figure 6.10c). These 
nucleotides, called dideoxynucleotides, can be added to the end of the primer; which 
one is added is determined by the base at the SNP (Figure 6.10d), but its addition 
prevents any other nucleotides being added. Each of the four dideoxynucleotides is 
labelled with a different fluorescent tag and hence the colour of the fluorescence 
after electrophoresis establishes the base at the SNP (Figure 6.10e).
 
By using different-length primers for different SNPs, several SNPs (at different 
loci) can be examined in the same reaction, and a profile, not unlike a DNA profile, 
is produced. For a sample of DNA evidence, the base at each SNP can be determined, 
which gives a genotype for each SNP locus. As with other types of variable DNA, an 
individual can be homozygous at the SNP if both his or her alleles have the same 
base, for example G,G, or heterozygous if the alleles are different, for example G,T. 
Using allele frequencies for each SNP, a likelihood of two people sharing the same 
profile can be estimated. The small number of alleles (maximum of four) means 
 196 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
that a larger number of SNPs (about 50) are needed in order to achieve the same 
discrimination as current STR-based profiling. 
 
Minisequencing illustrated in Figure 6.10 is just one of a number of techniques 
that allow the allele of an SNP to be determined. It is inappropriate to cover them 
all here. One method called microarray hybridisation analysis avoids using gel 
electrophoresis to separate SNP products and has the potential to examine a very 
large number of SNP loci simultaneously.
 
In principle, a DNA profiling system based entirely on SNPs could be developed 
and might have some advantages in that SNP analysis can give profiles with badly 
degraded DNA. Whether such a system could ever displace STR analysis remains 
to be seen. It seems unlikely, as the SNP data are not compatible with the current

DNA database. SNP data may be added to STR data. Where SNP analysis is likely to 
become important is in predicting features of the person who left the sample, as 
discussed in Section 6.6.5. 
6.5.2 Mitochondrial DNA analysis
Most of the forensic DNA analysis discussed earlier has been based on STR loci 
present in DNA in the cell nucleus. Despite its remarkable power and sensitivity, 
in some cases it may not be possible to obtain an STR profile because of the 
degradation of the nuclear DNA in the sample. Badly decomposed or charred bodies, 
old bones and hair shafts without roots are often poor sources of nuclear DNA. One 
course, in these circumstances, is to examine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). As 
explained briefly in Section 6.2.3, mtDNA is much more abundant – there may be 
tens or hundreds of thousands of copies of mtDNA per cell. mtDNA is not resistant 
to degradation, but its abundance means that some intact copies may survive 
longer. mtDNA analysis is essentially a comparison of SNPs in the mtDNA; it is not 
based on STR analysis.
6.5.3 mtDNA
Human mtDNA is a circular molecule of DNA, 16 569 bp in circumference (Figure 
6.11a). Unlike nuclear DNA, it has no ‘junk’ DNA; nearly every base pair has a 
function. The genetic information in the mitochondrion is essential and most of it 
does not vary between individuals – it is said to be highly conserved. When mutations 
are present, they are often associated with disease. Most of the mtDNA circle 
therefore has no forensic value because it varies very little between individuals. An 
exception to this is in the D-loop (or control region, in some texts). This section of 
the molecule, which is involved in replication of the mtDNA, is about 1000 bp long 
and contains two regions called hypervariable regions 1 and 2 (HV1 and HV2), which 
can vary in sequence. The sequence variation is mainly point mutations (single-base 
changes, SNPs), which do not alter the length of the DNA and are detected easily only 
by determining the base sequence of the DNA. Uncommon single-base insertions and 
deletions have been found. There are no STRs in mtDNA.
 
Mitochondria lack the DNA repair systems of the nucleus and, as a consequence, 
the mtDNA mutates at a higher rate and is likely to show sequence differences 
between individuals. In the hypervariable regions, a difference of 1–3 per cent may 
be expected between unrelated individuals; in other words, in a stretch of 100 bp up 
to 3 bp might be different. 
 
To investigate mtDNA, a procedure similar to the early stages of standard STR 
analysis is followed. DNA is extracted from the sample and PCR (Section 6.3.3) is 
then used to amplify the regions HV1 and HV2 using specific primers designed to 
base-pair to their ends (Figure 6.11a). The base-pair sequence of the amplified HV1 
and HV2 is then determined using a technique called DNA sequencing.
 
The DNA sequences of the hypervariable regions are then compared with a 
reference sequence, which is the first mtDNA to be sequenced, referred to as the 
Cambridge Reference Sequence. Differences are noted and can be compared with 
other samples (from suspects or victims) relevant to the particular case (Table 6.8).
 
In comparing the mtDNA sequences, it must be borne in mind how mtDNA is 
inherited. An individual inherits his or her mtDNA only from the mother. Although 
 198 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
the father’s sperm have mitochondria, these are not usually maintained in the 
fertilised egg. The consequence is that all the brothers and sisters in a family will 
share the same mtDNA as the mother but not the father. This pattern is called 
maternal inheritance. They will also share the same mtDNA as the mother’s siblings 
and the grandmother. Figure 6.11b shows an example of this. In the first generation, 
the children of the original couple all inherit their mother’s mtDNA. One of the 
daughters has children (generation 2) and these all share the same mtDNA. A son

in generation 1 also has children but, being male, he does not pass on his mtDNA to 
them; all his children will have the mtDNA of their mother. 
 
An individual should have just one type of mtDNA – that from his or her mother 
and the sequences of his or her hypervariable regions of only one type. This is the 
usual case and is termed homoplasmy. More rarely, in sequencing HV1 and HV2 of 
a person, it appears that two bases are present at a particular location. In this case, 
the person has two types of mitochondria, which differ in the base they carry at that 
position. This state is called heteroplasmy. 
 
mtDNA data are simply DNA base sequence data. HV1 and HV2 both generate 
DNA sequences of about 300 bp. For a given sample or individual, the base sequences 
are compared with the Cambridge Reference Sequence and the differences noted. 
Each base on the mtDNA is identified by a number according to its position on the 
DNA circle, from 1 (agreed by convention) to 16 569. Table 6.8 shows an example of 
mtDNA data.
 
In the example, the mtDNA of the living relative has an identical sequence to that 
of bodies 2, 3 and 5. The bodies could be siblings, a mother and children, or more 
complicated relations sharing a common maternal source for the mtDNA. Other 
forensic evidence would help to judge the relationships, and this could be supported 
by STR analysis. Bodies 1 and 4 have different sequences and are not maternally 
linked to the bodies or to each other. Body 4 at position 16 296 apparently has a 
T and an A, that is heteroplasmy. As with STR data, to put the interpretation on a 
firmer footing requires the application of more complex statistics than those used 
for STR analysis and are not appropriate at this level.
 
mtDNA analysis is not as discriminating between unrelated individuals as is STR 
DNA profiling. The advantage of mtDNA is that it can be applied successfully to 
samples that fail to produce STR data. Until fairly recently, DNA sequencing was 
slow, technically difficult and labour-intensive. It has become easier with automated 
approaches developed from the genome sequencing projects, but it is still not as 
straightforward as STR profiling.

Another approach to analysing mtDNA utilises minisequencing (Figure 6.10 
and Section 6.5.1). Although the HV1 and HV2 regions are variable in sequence 
by definition, certain bases in them are more likely than others to mutate. 
Minisequencing selects 12 of these bases in the D-loop and determines the bases 
at those particular sites. Comparison is made of the data from evidence with the 
reference sequence and with data of suspects, victims or relatives. Mismatches 
between samples enable suspects to be excluded. Matched sequences may then have 
to be re-examined by full sequencing of HV1 and HV2. Minisequencing is rapid, and 
technological advances may allow more sites to be examined.
6.5.4 Applications of mtDNA analysis
One application has been in the identification of old, badly degraded bodies. 
Box 6.3 gives two examples, the identification of the Romanov remains and the 
identification of the remains of a US airman from Vietnam. mtDNA has also been 
employed in identifying bodies from air disasters. 
 
mtDNA can be employed to study non-human remains. If it is necessary to 
demonstrate the source animal for a product suspected to be made from a 
protected species, then the cytochrome b gene on the mtDNA can be PCR amplified 
and sequenced. This well-studied gene is used widely in taxonomy, and the sequence 
should identify the species. 
 
As mtDNA is not as discriminating as STR analysis, it is often used forensically 
only when standard profiling has failed. Nevertheless it does have niche applications 
within the field.
A classic case involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was 
the confirmation of the remains of the Russian imperial 
family. In the course of the Russian Revolution, the 
Tsar and his family were captured by the Bolsheviks and 
were executed in July 1918. The graves were rumoured 
to be in a wood near Ekaterinburg, Russia. DNA isolated 
from bones excavated from the site in 1991 revealed by 
STR analysis that a family group was present but this 
evidence did not say anything about the bones being 
those of the Romanovs. To address this, use was made 
of mtDNA: since this is inherited only down the maternal 
line, any maternal descendants of the Romanovs should 
show the same sequence of mtDNA. Prince Philip, Duke 
of Edinburgh, is a living maternal descendent of Tsarina 
Alexandra’s sister. His mtDNA sequences were identical 
to those from the bones of the three children and their 
mother on the basis of the STR analysis, essentially 
proving they were the bones of the Romanovs. 
 
mtDNA has been used in the identification of old  
and badly degraded bodies. The US Army Central 
Identification Laboratory has used it to identify the 
remains of American servicemen lost overseas, for 
example in Vietnam. In 1998, the unit identified remains 
interred in the Tomb of the Unknowns as those of Air 
Force Lieutenant Michael J. Blassie, 26 years after he was 
shot down in Vietnam.

6.6 Current and future developments
It has been the aim of this chapter to describe the genetic and technical background 
to current DNA profiling. Such an important technology does not remain static.
This section intends to briefly outline developments that have taken place since the 
establishment of the basic technology and those that are occurring or may occur in 
forensic DNA analysis.
6.6.1  Low Copy Number or Low Template DNA and 
sensitivity
There is a strong motivation to try to increase the sensitivity of DNA profiling to 
enable the analysis of a wider range of evidence. Very low levels degraded DNA can 
result in poor-quality or completely negative results using standard DNA profiling. 
Research at the FSS of England and Wales led to the development of an extremely 
sensitive technique called Low Copy Number DNA profiling (LCN), which is an 
extension of the SGM+ technology. Recent discussions in the literature use the term 
LTDNA, referring to Low Template DNA, which is often used interchangeably with 
the term LCN; LTDNA is generic, referring to analysis of low amounts of sample 
DNA, whereas LCN refers to a specific technique to analyse very small amounts 
of evidence. The increased sensitivity in LCN is in part achieved by increasing the 
number of cycles in the PCR stage (Section 6.3.3) from 28 to 34, thereby increasing 
the amount of product about 100 fold. LCN is often capable of producing a profile 
from amounts of DNA that are too small to quantify, even from a single cell. 
Application of this technique has allowed DNA profiles to be made and successfully 
used as evidence from incredibly small samples, for example the few skin cells left in 
a physical fingerprint or a lip-print. A flake of dandruff can give a full profile, as can a 
single hair. Surfaces likely to have been touched may be sources of DNA even though 
there may be no obvious stain or sample.
 
LCN is employed in situations where standard SGM+ profiling has produced 
a partial or negative result or where insufficient DNA has been produced from the 
sample for standard profiling. The quality or amount of sample itself, from previous 
experience, may suggest that a normal DNA profiling reaction would fail.
 
Old stored evidence from unsolved or resolved cases which pre-dated DNA 
profiling or previously failed to give DNA profiles can be re-examined using LCN with 
some dramatic results (see Box 6.4).
 
Increased sensitivity inevitably means a greater risk of contamination and 
generation of artefacts in the data. The extreme sensitivity of LCN readily produces 
mixed profiles and partial profiles (Section 6.4.5). Nevertheless, it has proved 
to be a very powerful technique. LCN requires rigour in the laboratory to avoid 
contamination and also at the crime scene where the evidence is collected.
 
LCN is so sensitive that it has raised issues about transfer of DNA from the site 
where the evidence was deposited to another location. It could be imagined that 
when person A shakes hands with person B, some of A’s skin cells are transferred 
to B who then touches an object at a crime scene, depositing A’s cells and hence 
DNA at the scene. Similarly B might touch an object previously touched by A and 
transfer A’s cells to another location (note, though, that it is also likely that B’s 
cells would also be present producing a mixed sample). Such inadvertent transfer 
 202 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
probably occurs all the time but would be difficult to detect normally as the amount 
of material transferred will be extremely small; however, LCN is capable of detecting 
extremely small amounts of evidence. Such transfer of material can be demonstrated 
in laboratory experiments, but its relevance in the ‘real world’ is unclear; it may 
provide a case for the defence. 
 
As mentioned, LCN-generated profiles are often mixed and incomplete. Mixed 
profiles are open to interpretation (Section 6.4.5 and Figure 6.9) and partial profiles, 
since they are lacking information, result in lower match probabilities; that is, they 
are less discriminating than a full profile. Further, artefacts such as allele drop-out, 
where particular alleles are missing from the profile, or allele drop-in, whereby an 
incorrect allele, presumably from contamination, appears in the profile, can be 
present in LCN data. The consequence of these is that the genotype may contain 
some errors. Note that these artefacts may be present in profile data generally but 
the low amount of DNA evidence in LCN analysis makes their presence much more 
likely. Hence extreme care must be taken in the interpretation of LCN data. The 
successful challenge to the validity of LCN-generated DNA evidence based in part on 
the quality of the data in the R vs. Hoey case (Box 6.5) led to a suspension of the use 
of the technique and a review of its application. Recommendations from the review 
are intended to improve the use of LCN evidence and its use has been endorsed by 
the Forensic Science Regulator. However, this does not satisfy critics and it is likely 
that use of LCN evidence in court will be strongly challenged. 
Marion Crofts, a 14-year-old schoolgirl cycling near her 
home in Fleet, Hampshire, UK, was raped and murdered 
in June 1981. With the development of LCN in the late  
1990s, evidence stored 20 years before could be 
re-examined. A DNA profile was obtained from 
Marion’s clothing and also from a microscope slide 
containing evidence from Marion’s body. A decision 
had been made to leave the slide untouched until 
DNA technology had advanced sufficiently in order to 
be confident of producing a profile from such an old, 
small sample. A search of the National DNA Database 
revealed a match to a sample taken from the body and 
the slide. The probability of someone unrelated having 
the same profile was one in a billion. Tony Jasinskyj 
had been arrested on suspicion of assault, and hence 
his profile was on the database. In May 2002, he was 
convicted for the rape and murder of Marion Crofts.
 
Another example where improved methods are 
expanding the potential for DNA analysis is a case from 
August 2002. John Anthony Cook was convicted for the 
murder of Monica Jepson, a pensioner, at a nursing home 
in Birmingham, UK, in 1995. A DNA profile was produced 
using LCN on a faecal sample left at the scene of the 
crime. Faeces can be a good source of mitochondrial 
DNA, but standard profiling is not usually successful. The 
profile obtained matched that of John Cook, whose DNA 
profile was on the database because of his arrest in an 
unrelated incident. This evidence and that of a partial 
fingerprint led to his conviction. Excrement is frequently 
deposited at crime scenes, and hence this development 
may prove very important.

Jasinskyj case and the John Anthony Cook case
CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS n 203

 
 
Although it may not be used as routinely as SGM+ profiling owing to the 
associated difficulty in anti-contamination and interpretation of the DNA profile, the 
fact that LCN might prove useful as the investigation progresses has an impact on 
the collection of material from the scene of crime. Contact traces may be sampled 
from areas likely to have been touched by the offender. Evidence can be collected 
and stored with appropriate precautions in case it is necessary to apply LCN in the 
future. It is difficult to imagine that the system could become more sensitive than 
that of LCN procedures. LCN is now widely used, despite higher costs, as it has 
had a great impact on improving detection rates in volume crime such as burglary 
and vehicle theft, making it cost effective. Wider use and provision will lead to cost 
reductions and it is expected that LCN will be carried out in all cases where it can be 
used. The Omagh case, shock though it was to the confidence in DNA evidence, has 
had a positive impact on LCN use in that, prior to the evidence being submitted to 
court, it is likely to be even more rigorously scrutinized.
6.6.2 Technical developments
Automation
To be effective in a wide variety of forensic work, large numbers of samples need to 
be processed. Single cases could be imagined to generate numerous samples and, if 
local population screening is undertaken, this will run into thousands. Certain cases 
will be given priority over others, but ideally the processing time of any sample 
would be as rapid as possible. The costs of the tests will be an issue for the police 
force requesting them. Automation, and the expansion of the technical provision, 
are allowing the processing of very large numbers of DNA samples. With current 
On 15 August 1998, a car bomb exploded in the centre 
of Omagh. Twenty-nine people were killed and over 
200 injured, making it the worst terrorist atrocity 
in Northern Ireland. Sean Hoey was arrested and 
charged with 29 murders and other offences related 
to the bombing. In R vs. Hoey, DNA evidence was 
central to the prosecution’s argument of Sean Hoey’s 
involvement. This case was based on LCN-generated 
DNA profiles from evidence found on the bomb timers. 
Sean Hoey was acquitted of the charges in late 2007 
as the validity of the evidence came into question 
under defence arguments about the reliability of 
LCN-generated profiles.  Mr Justice Weir referred to 
LCN as potentially unreliable and lacking validity. 
His damning comments led to the suspension of the 
use of LCN evidence by the police, pending a review 
of the technique. Professor Brian Caddy’s report 
concluded that the technique was fundamentally safe 
and the science was sound and secure, and a set of 
recommendations was produced to improve the use of 
LCN evidence. The Forensic Science Regulator endorsed 
its use and is confident that it is safe to use in courts. 
This is a controversial point and not all would agree 
with this conclusion.  Only in the UK, New Zealand and 
the Netherlands is LCN data admissible as evidence. 
Elsewhere it is only used as an investigative tool.

technology, up to 80 samples of potential DNA evidence can be processed rapidly, 
taking as little as 8 hours from crime scene to court statement. 
Portability
Hand-held equipment that would allow a profile to be generated very rapidly after 
sampling the evidence directly at the crime scene has been proposed and is being 
developed. Technical developments in these fields can be incredibly fast, and 
‘real-time’ DNA profiling could occur at scenes in the not too distant future.
Modifications to STR analysis
PCR is more efficient when amplifying shorter fragments than longer fragments. In 
forensic applications, badly degraded DNA may not give a profile at all or may give 
only a partial profile. To improve the success rate of STR analysis on problematic 
DNA samples, one approach is to reduce the size of the fragments to be amplified. 
This can be achieved by redesigning the primers to be closer to the repeat sequence 
(Figure 6.6 and Section 6.3.3); hence, for each locus the range of allele size will be 
smaller and more likely to be amplified by PCR on degraded DNA. Such a system 
called Minifiler™ from Applied Biosystems is available; on poor-quality DNA, where 
SGM+ gives partial profiles or fails, this can give good-quality full profiles.
Mixed profiles
The problem of mixed profiles was discussed in Section 6.4.5 and Figure 6.9. The 
FSS in the UK has piloted a potentially very powerful system called DNAboost™, 
which aims to determine the genotypes present in the mixture. This is achieved by 
generating all possible permutations of genotypes from the data and using these 
to interrogate the database. Matches provide intelligence leads for the police to 
further their investigation. Four UK police forces piloted DNAboost on 2000 mixed 
samples; it increased the number of searchable profiles by 25 per cent, helping 
police to identify suspects and build evidence for a case. DNAboost is considered fit 
for purpose and is available to be used by all forces. Clearly, this development is of 
potentially great importance, allowing perhaps 10 000 poor-quality samples per year 
to provide useful leads. Its use with poor-quality samples does need caution and care 
in interpretation, as with LCN analysis (see Section 6.6.1).
Ageing the evidence
DNA profiles give no information about the timing of the deposition of the evidence. 
Certainly, older samples may have only degraded DNA, but this depends on the 
evidence’s environment. The time at which the evidence was left, though, could 
be crucial to an investigation in the inclusion and exclusion of suspects. Research 
on the question of sample age has examined not DNA, which is relatively stable, 
but RNA. RNA is labile; by looking at the rate of decay of certain RNAs in blood, 
predictions could be made about how long the evidence was deposited before being 
collected by the forensic scientist. Such work is in the research stage. It might 
be imagined that the rate of RNA decay would alter dramatically under different 
CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS n 205

 
environmental conditions and in different cell types, and hence a general test to age 
evidence based on nucleic acid analysis is currently difficult to envisage.
Identifying the evidence
With LCN the nature of the evidence might be unknown: yes, DNA evidence was found, 
but what type of tissue was the source? Was it a very small spot of blood, saliva or 
semen? This could be highly relevant to an investigation. Most cells from an individual 
contain the same genomic DNA. To address this question, RNA analysis has been 
proposed because each cell type produces a different set of RNAs. A gene that is active 
in a given cell type will produce an mRNA (Figure 6.3b, Section 6.2.3). If this mRNA is 
present, it indicates that the gene is ‘switched on’. Testing evidence for certain tissue-
specific RNAs could help establish its source tissue if the RNA survives in the evidence. 
For example, a gene PRM1 is expressed in semen; the presence of its messenger 
RNA could be used as a test for semen with greater sensitivity than conventional 
presumptive tests (Chapter 5, Section 5.4.2). Again, this is still a research question 
and is not yet applied to forensic work, although the field is developing rapidly. 
6.6.3 Wider application of DNA profiling
Originally, DNA profiling was associated with serious crimes of murder, rape and 
assault, but increasing sensitivity and automation have led to its being applied to a 
wider range of crimes, for example car crime and burglary. Box 6.6 gives an example 
of its use in accident investigations. 
 206 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 
Swissair Flight 111 flying from New York to Geneva, in 
September 1998, crashed into the sea off the coast at 
Peggy Cove near Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, killing 
all 229 passengers and crew. On impact, the plane 
underwent severe fragmentation. Only one body could 
be identified visually. Identification of many of the 
bodies and body parts (exceeding 2500) was only 
possible using DNA analysis, although other evidence 
was also employed, for example fingerprints, and dental 
and radiological details. STR DNA profiling was carried 
out on over 1200 samples at several sites in Canada. 
The majority of tests were successful, even on material 
that was retrieved 3 months after the accident. To make 
positive identifications, the profiles had to be compared 
with those of relatives (about 300 were used, from 20 
different countries). In some cases, DNA profiles were 
obtained from personal effects at the homes of the 
deceased (hairbrushes, razor blades, etc.). Clearly, the 
identification of the remains was an enormous effort, 
but through good organisation and procedures (based 
on experience of other air crashes) within just over 2 
months all the victims had been identified.
 
mtDNA (Section 6.5.2) has also been used widely in 
body identification in accidents and catastrophes (see 
Box 6.3).
Box 6.6
Case study

Swissair Flight 111

 
 
Every DNA profile requested has a financial cost to the police. In the past, the 
relatively high cost influenced judgements about whether to use DNA evidence 
in a particular investigation. The cost had to be balanced with the high success 
rate using DNA evidence, which ultimately reduced the time of the investigation. 
Expanding provision, automation and competition among agencies providing DNA 
profiling services have reduced the cost of standard DNA profiling to between £30 
and £300. Along with fingerprinting, DNA profiling is considered as the first choice 
of evidence in criminal cases.
6.6.4 Increasing the number of STR loci analysed
The more STR loci that are examined in DNA profiling, the more unlikely it 
becomes that two people could share the same profile. The SGM+ system described 
in Section 6.3.5 with 11 loci and analysed in Section 6.4.2 already has such a high 
discrimination that it is thought to be highly unlikely, but not certain, that two 
unrelated people (except identical twins) could have the same profile. Clearly, more 
loci could be added to further reduce the likelihood of fortuitous matches. For 
instance, 16-loci systems have been developed and are used in population genetic 
studies and forensic relationship testing, but they are currently not used routinely 
on forensic evidence in the UK. The argument to increase the number of loci in 
the UK is that the NDNAD is now so large that the chance of accidental matches 
occurring is becoming significant. The match probabilities achieved with SGM+ 
are extremely low, but the value assumes the likelihood of a match among non-
relatives. If a match for relatives is considered, then the probability over the 10 loci 
is still low but significantly higher than the figures calculated earlier. There are 
numerous relatives in the NDNAD, and the likelihood of obtaining a chance match 
is approaching a significant level, although an accidental match has never occurred 
to date. Moving to a system with more loci than SGM+ would make this less likely. 
More loci would also give greater confidence in establishing relatedness in familial 
searching of the database (Section 6.4.4). The counter-argument was that 10 
loci are adequate, and the possibility of relatives, and not the actual perpetrator, 
being identified in a database search is always considered when the strength of the 
evidence is being addressed.
 
As mentioned in Section 6.4.5, the figure routinely quoted in court for full 
matching SGM+ DNA profiles is one in a billion. If more loci were added to the 
profiling system in the UK it would not necessarily alter how the data are presented 
in court, unless the procedures were reviewed to take account of the modified system. 
In 2009, the National DNA Database Strategy Board agreed to move to a 15-loci 
system, incorporating all the loci of SGM+ with an additional five loci. This will be 
implemented throughout the UK, once practical and ethical issues have been resolved. 
In the more distant future, perhaps some loci could be changed or incorporated if 
some of these are associated with specific traits (Section 6.6.5). Such changes, 
though, would have implications for the DNA database, but see Section 6.6.7.
6.6.5 Interpreting DNA: predicting phenotypic features
With the exception of the amelogenin locus from which the sex of the DNA source 
can be determined, the other loci examined in DNA profiling are STRs, and the 
alleles, as far as is known, are not associated with any physical features of a person 
CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS n 207

 
carrying them. There could clearly be some advantage in crime investigations if the 
DNA evidence could be read to give clues to the physical appearance of a suspect. 
This work is in its early stages. 
 
The melanocortin I receptor gene (MCIR) encodes a protein involved in the 
control of the pigmentation of hair. Along the gene are 12 SNPs, and certain alleles 
of these are associated with red hair colour. A person having one of these alleles 
from each parent is highly likely to have red hair. This forms the basis of a genetic 
test for red hair, which can be carried out on DNA evidence. The allele of each SNP 
can be determined using minisequencing (Figure 6.10). The test is not absolute; 
with the appropriate genotype, it is about 96 per cent likely, but not certain, that 
the suspect would have red hair. Such a prediction of hair colour could be of use 
in particular investigations, but generally red hair colour is not very common in 
the population and a crime is more likely to be committed by a non-redhead. Red 
hair colour is much more common in certain racial groups, and markers for red 
hair could be incorporated into genetic ethnicity/racial tests. The genetics of more 
common hair colours and types are not simple but are being researched with the 
intention of analysing DNA for predictive purposes. Regardless of the predicted 
genetic hair colour or type, the actual hair characteristics of the person may be very 
different, as hair is readily and commonly modified, for example by the use of hair 
dyes and straightening, or naturally through baldness and greying.
 
Research on a gene called OCA2 on chromosome 15 has given us some 
understanding of the genetic basis of eye colour. The gene is involved with broader 
aspects of pigmentation in hair and skin as well as eyes, and some mutations in it 
result in a form of albinism. Three SNPs close to, but not actually in, the coding 
part of the gene were found to be associated strongly with eye colour in terms of 
brown and blue. Other SNP alleles were associated with green eyes. This is not the 
only gene involved with determining eye colour. More recent work examining SNPs 
in six genes associated with eye colour has resulted in a test ‘IrisPlex’ with very good 
predictive value for blue and brown eyes. This may be a model for future phenotypic 
predictive tests. Eventually such research could lead to a forensic minisequencing 
assay to predict eye colour and perhaps skin characteristics. 
 
Studies of the frequency of various STR alleles in groups of different geog´raphic 
ancestry have shown that some are more frequent in certain groups. From this, 
the geographic origin of ancestors of the individual leaving DNA evidence can 
be predicted, not with certainty but with a certain probability. It has proved 
very difficult to define ethnic/racial groups genetically, as the majority of 
markers STRs or SNPs are found in most populations, although the individual 
population frequencies may vary significantly. From a DNA profile, a likelihood of 
ethnicity or geographic ancestry can be made; it is not absolute, but it may be a 
useful lead. In the UK, the FSS offers an ‘ethnic inference’ test, which gives the 
likelihood of a DNA sample originating from each of five groups – white European, 
Afro-Caribbean, Indian Subcontinental, South-East Asian and Middle Eastern.
 
Predicting the age of the person leaving the DNA evidence could also be useful 
information, but currently there is no way to address this with any degree of 
precision using DNA analysis. 
 
Research is under way into the genetics of many physical features (e.g. skin 
type and colour, height, facial characteristics). Forensically, an ideal outcome of 
such research would be the generation of a ‘photofit’ of a suspect from the DNA 
 208 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
evidence, although currently this seems a long way off, if it is possible at all. 
Although this does seem somewhat fanciful at present, the pace of developments 
in the understanding of human genetics is very rapid, and predicting the timing 
of envisaged outcomes difficult; the impacts of next-generation sequencing will be 
immense (see Section 6.6.7). As discussed in Section 6.2.1, factors other than a 
person’s genes can influence their appearance. There is also some ethical concern 
that some features may be associated with diseases and, hence, medical aspects of 
the person would be revealed in the analysis of some characteristics.
6.6.6 DNA databases
In the future, there may be more international sharing of database information. Not 
all countries examine the same loci in their DNA profiles, but most systems have 
some in common, allowing comparisons to be made across borders.
 
The power of the NDNAD in the UK (Section 6.3.6) is constantly being 
demonstrated and is likely to become greater with more use of familial searching 
and applications, involving new developments, for example DNAboost. As mentioned 
earlier, at the end of 2009 there were about 4.8 million DNA profiles on the 
database representing about 7 per cent of the UK population. This is the largest 
DNA database in the world, with the highest proportion of the population in it. It 
is predicted to eventually rise to about 5 million samples. In 2006, about 20 000 
people were convicted with the help of DNA evidence. From the point of view of 
solving crime, the bigger the database, the more effective it will be. However, legal 
and ethical concerns regarding the database and its use are expressed strongly by 
a number of groups. The debate about whether everybody in the UK should have 
their profile on the database recurs occasionally. Such a complete database would 
certainly be a powerful resource in terms of criminal detection. Clearly, then, 
a profile from evidence would be seen to link directly to a suspect. It has been 
argued that this would be a great deterrent to criminal activity. Currently, there 
is a high chance of an evidence profile matching a database profile (about 60 per 
cent), and there might be thought to be some deterrent aspect to the database, 
but whether this is demonstrated by crime figures is debatable. A complete DNA 
database of the UK population would contain sensitive information not related to 
crime, for example cases of illegitimacy and cases where the accepted father is 
not the biological father. Should this information be available to people with no 
connection to the families concerned? The database also contains a huge number of 
profiles from people who have not been charged or have been acquitted; they have 
not been convicted of a crime but their DNA will remain on the database for life. 
Currently, there are about 1 million of these DNA profiles. In England and Wales 
(the law in Scotland is different) DNA profiles can be taken and kept from a person 
arrested for an offence that could lead to a prison sentence, even if he or she is not 
subsequently charged. In some countries, it is illegal to retain samples from people 
who have been acquitted. However, a ruling by the European Court of Human 
Rights in 2008 effectively makes this retention of profiles a contravention of the 
European Convention on Human Rights. In response to this judgment and to the 
concerns of other groups, the Protection of Freedoms Bill – part of which addresses 
the retention of DNA data – has been put forward by the UK government. This bill 
will be debated and voted on in 2011. If it becomes law, in England and Wales, 
DNA material will not be retained from those who have been charged or arrested 
CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS n 209

 
but not convicted of minor offences. For serious crime, people arrested but not 
convicted will have their DNA profiles retained for 3 years with possible extension. 
Where national security is involved, the profiles may be retained indefinitely. These 
proposals resemble, but are not identical to, the laws already in force in Scotland. 
 
Concern has also been expressed at the proportion of ethnic groups on the 
database: 37 per cent of black men have their profile on the database, while the 
figures for Asian men and white men are 13 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. 
A DNA database of the entire population would at least be representative of the 
population. Some advocates of such a database argue that because of the sensitive 
nature of some of the information, it should be administered by a body with no 
connection to the police. At the time of writing (October 2010), the NDNAD is 
delivered by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) who ensure it is 
operated within agreed standards. These standards are determined by the National 
DNA Database Strategy Board which is constituted by representatives from the 
NPIA/Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association 
of Police Authorities. There is also the concern that the database, by including 
many unconvicted people, is altering the state’s perception of its population, 
relegating them to potential suspects in the future. There is no question of the 
value, importance and power of the NDNAD in the investigation of crime and 
other incidents, but anything that touches upon the nature of individuality and its 
application is bound to raise important ethical concerns. 
6.6.7 Next-generation sequencing
DNA sequencing allows the precise base sequence (Section 6.2.2) to be determined. 
As explained in Section 6.5.1, DNA sequencing is still usually avoided for routine 
analysis of DNA evidence samples. Despite major technical developments which 
allowed partial automation of the process and modifications to the original 
sequencing chemistry, standard DNA sequencing is still rather slow and technically 
demanding. Sequencing of the human genome (3.2 × 109 bp of DNA) was an 
international collaboration which cost in the order of $3 billion and took 11 years 
from the announcement of the Human Genome Project in 1990 to the publication 
of the first drafts in 2001. This was a landmark achievement in human genetics 
whose impacts are starting to be realised. 
 
More recently, different approaches to sequencing chemistry and developments 
in technology have led to next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. There 
are a number of these systems which are currently available with the prospect 
of new, faster systems in the near future and the interested reader is directed to 
books listed at the end of this chapter. The key points about NGS are the dramatic 
increase in the speed of sequencing large numbers of base pairs and the low cost. 
With these technologies, the prospect of sequencing entire human genomes 
routinely does not seem so distant. Genetic diagnosis and understanding of human 
genetics will be revolutionised by this ability. 
 
Clearly the application of NGS to forensic DNA analysis is a possibility. How it 
could be applied would need to be carefully planned and debated. It would probably 
not be necessary to completely sequence the genome (or genomes) present in 
evidence (and there would be ethical concerns about this) but the sequencing 
could concentrate on chosen STR loci (incorporating the ‘standard loci’ in SGM+ 
 210 n THE ANALYSIS OF DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA): DNA PROFILING 

 
or other systems making the data compatible with existing data bases), though the 
number of these could be much larger than in existing multiplex PCR DNA profiling 
systems. The more loci that are used, the better the discriminatory power (Section 
6.6.4). Also, the sequencing could focus on SNP loci associated with the appearance 
of the evidence donor (Section 6.6.5) or simply as additional markers. With such 
detailed genetic information from the sample it may be possible to resolve genomes 
present in mixtures. It is easy to imagine sequencing the entire mtDNA rather than 
just focusing on HV1 and HV2 (Section 6.5.3) and incorporating Y chromosome 
analysis. All this data would be generated by the one analysis of the evidence. 
Modification of the method could also allow detection of specific RNAs relevant to 
evidence identification (Section 6.6.2). The application of NGS to forensic work is 
currently speculative but it is unlikely that such powerful technology will not find 
important applications in forensic DNA analysis and allow more powerful application 
of it.
 
From its origins in the mid-1980s, DNA profiling has become established as a 
major tool of forensic science. Over the coming years, the continuing and astonishing 
progress in human genetics related to the human genome sequence will certainly have 
implications for forensic DNA analysis, both technically and in terms of the information 
that can be gleaned from the DNA evidence left at an incident or scene of crime.
n Linking a biological sample, found at a crime scene or other 
incident, to the individual from which it originated with 
a high degree of confidence has been possible only since 
the development of DNA profiling (or DNA typing). DNA 
profiling analyses the DNA present in biological material, 
producing a pattern called a profile that ideally would be 
unique to that individual.
n Differences between individuals at the level of DNA are of 
a number of types. Of particular interest in forensic DNA 
analysis are tandem repeat alleles, in particular, in modern 
procedures, short tandem repeats (STRs). Based around a 
genetic technique called the polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), modern DNA profiling allows the generation of an 
STR profile from incredibly small amounts of material (as 
are often found at crime scenes) and samples that may 
be decades old. The data generated by the procedures can 
be analysed using established principles of population 
genetics to produce an estimate of the likelihood that 
two unrelated people could show the same profile or 
the likelihood that a sample of evidence originated from 
a given suspect. DNA profiling is the basis of modern 
paternity testing.
n Its remarkable sensitivity and discriminating powers have 
led to DNA profiling becoming a major technique in forensic 
science; its impact cannot be overstated. A number of 
countries have set up DNA databases that store the profiles 
from suspects or criminals as well as profiles from crime 
scenes. As new evidence becomes available, it can be 
searched against the databases, perhaps linking people to 
crimes or linking two unsolved crimes.
n Mitochondrial DNA analysis is based on DNA sequencing 
rather than STR analysis. It has had many forensic 
applications and tends to be used if STR analysis has failed.
n Such a powerful technology as DNA profiling does not remain 
static; it is being developed in a number of ways, allowing 
improved sensitivity, robustness, precision and speed. The 
remarkably rapid progress in human genetic research will 
undoubtedly impact on aspects of DNA profiling as well as 
having other profound future forensic applications.

Introduction
Forensic toxicology may be defined as the scientific study of poisons in relation to the 
law. The creation of this discipline is credited to the Spanish physician Mathieu Orfila 
(1787–1853), who published his landmark treatise on poisons, Traité des poisons, 
in 1813. A poison is any substance that produces an injurious or lethal effect when 
administered to, or otherwise taken up by, an organism in a sufficiently high quantity. 
 
An individual may be exposed to toxic (i.e. poisonous) substances by accident 
(e.g. in the workplace or the environment, or through ingesting contaminated 
food). Poisons may be administered as a means of suicide or murder. Many 
potentially harmful substances are deliberately taken by individuals for the mood- 
and mind-altering effects that they induce. These substances are known collectively 
as drugs of abuse. 
 
This chapter begins with a description of the main groups of poisons, with the 
exception of those used as drugs of abuse, which are considered separately in the 
following section (Section 7.2). The factors affecting the toxicity of a substance, and 
the routes of uptake and elimination of toxic compounds, are considered in Sections 
Forensic toxicology 
and drugs of abuse
  7

 
 216  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
7.3 and 7.4 respectively. The chapter concludes with a review of the means by which 
poisons, including drugs of abuse, may be analysed within the forensic context.
7.1 Common poisons
Poisons may be classified in many ways, for example according to their chemical 
structure, the effect that they have on the physiology of the human body or the 
methods used for their extraction prior to analysis. Each system therefore 
emphasises a particular facet of toxicology.
 
In this book, the following broad groups of poisons are explored: anions, 
corrosive poisons, gaseous and volatile poisons, metal and metalloid poisons, 
pesticides, toxins and drugs of abuse. Each of these groups is examined in turn 
within this section, with the exception of drugs of abuse, which are dealt with 
separately in Section 7.2. It should be noted that, in some cases, a particular poison 
may be placed in more than one of the broad categories given above. For example, 
strychnine is an extremely poisonous toxin that has been used as a pesticide, 
especially against mammalian pests. Hence, although placed in the section dealing 
with toxins, it could also be categorised as a pesticide.
7.1.1  Anions 
An anion is a negative ion. Many compounds used in the home and/or workplace 
contain toxic anions, for example some weedkillers, bleaching agents and 
insecticides. One of the most toxic anions is cyanide (CN–). For example, a lethal 
dose of its potassium salt (KCN) when taken by mouth can be as little as 2.8 mg per 
kg of body mass. Examples of other, less poisonous, toxic anions include fluoride 
(F–), bromide (Br–), iodide (I–), chlorate(I) (ClO–, also called hypochlorite), nitrite 
(NO2
–), nitrate (NO3
–), oxalate (C2O4
2–) and sulphite (SO3
2–).
7.1.2  Corrosive poisons 
Corrosive poisons are those that cause destruction of the body tissues upon contact. 
The severity of the resultant damage is determined by the concentration and nature 
of the substance concerned, and the length of contact time. Corrosive poisons 
are often ingested, causing surface damage to the mouth and intestinal tract. On 
occasion, they may penetrate deeper into the tissues, causing perforation of the gut 
wall. Without appropriate and rapid treatment, corrosive poisons may prove fatal. 
The use of corrosive poisons as a means of murder or suicide in developed countries 
is now relatively unusual compared with the past. However, in less developed 
countries incidents involving such poisons are still encountered fairly frequently. 
 
Common corrosive poisons include both acids and alkalis. The acids concerned 
may be strong mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid (HNO3) 
or sulphuric acid (H2SO4), or organic acids, for example acetic acid (CH3COOH) 
and oxalic acid (COOH)2. Among the alkalis that may be used as corrosive poisons 
are potassium hydroxide (caustic potash, KOH) and sodium hydroxide (caustic 
soda, NaOH). There are also corrosive poisons that are neither acids nor alkalis, for 
example heavy metal salts and some strong detergents.
Poison
Any substance that 
has an injurious 
or fatal effect when 
introduced into, or 
taken up by, a living 
organism.

 
COMMON POISONS  217
7.1.3  Gaseous and volatile poisons
There are several unrelated gases that may be placed in this category, the most 
important of which, in a forensic context, are carbon monoxide (CO) (described in 
more detail below) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). This group also includes the volatile 
poisons, which are substances that easily vaporise at normal temperatures and 
pressures to produce toxic vapours. Some volatile substances are used recreationally 
for the ‘high’ feelings that they induce (Section 7.2.2). Circumstantial evidence at 
a scene may indicate the presence of a particular toxic gas or vapour, while careful 
examination of the scene will often help to establish the manner of death.
 
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas, which is extremely poisonous 
to humans. Haemoglobin, the principal oxygen carrier in vertebrate blood, has a 
much higher affinity for carbon monoxide than it does for oxygen and preferentially 
combines with it to form carboxyhaemoglobin. This reaction reduces the oxygen- 
carrying capacity of the blood and may therefore lead to death by asphyxia.
 
Carbon monoxide is formed from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, which 
may occur, for example, when domestic appliances (e.g. gas fires and water heaters) 
are faulty and/or ventilation is restricted, or during fires. It is often, therefore, a 
cause of accidental death. Carbon monoxide is also present in the exhaust gases of 
motor vehicles, a source that is frequently used in suicide.
 
The post-mortem examination of individuals who have died as a result of gas 
poisoning might reveal the likely identity of the gas responsible. For example, 
the unusual cherry-pink appearance of any post-mortem lividity indicates carbon 
monoxide poisoning while a deeper red coloration of this feature is sometimes 
observed in cases of cyanide poisoning (Chapter 12, Section 12.2.2).
7.1.4  Metal and metalloid poisons
There are a number of metals and metalloids that are poisonous to humans; the 
most common of these are arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) (both metalloids), and 
the metals lead (Pb), lithium (Li), mercury (Hg) and thallium (Tl). Symptoms of 
poisoning with such elements include vomiting and diarrhoea (possibly bloody), 
cramps and paralysis. Death may take place within 24 hours but more usually 
occurs after several days or even many weeks. Individuals may ingest toxic metals 
or metalloids as a means of suicide, or accidentally come into contact with them 
through, for example, industrial or environmental exposure. 
 
Historically, the deliberate administration of certain metals and metalloids has 
frequently been used as a means of murder, especially before the introduction of 
appropriate legislative controls and the development of suitable detection techniques. 
Arsenic, in the form of compounds such as arsenious oxide (As2O3) (a tasteless, 
white powder), was particularly popular in this respect. It could be found in a variety 
of manufactured products such as weedkillers and insecticides (e.g. in fly-papers). 
A major advantage of using metals or metalloids to kill was the similarity of the 
symptoms they produced to those caused by food poisoning or common diseases such 
as dysentery and cholera. Moreover, such poisons could be administered in small 
quantities over time, for example in food or as a substitute for necessary therapeutic 
drugs, a tactic that could only help to avoid suspicion when death eventually came. 
However, the use of potentially toxic metals and metalloids as agents of murder is now 
relatively rare in developed countries. It should be noted that such poisons, like many 

 
 218  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
others, persist in the body after death. Arsenic, for example, may be detected in the 
hair, nails and bones many years after the individual has died.
7.1.5  Pesticides
A pesticide may be defined as any chemical substance that kills organisms 
regarded as pests. This general definition encompasses more specific terms that 
reflect the type of target organism concerned, such as fungicide, insecticide, 
herbicide (kills weeds) and rodenticide (kills rats, mice, etc.). Pesticides are widely 
used in agriculture, horticulture and, to some extent, in the home environment. 
Humans may become accidentally exposed to pesticides, for example during the 
manufacturing process, through inappropriate application techniques, by contact 
with coated seeds or in contaminated foodstuffs. Pesticides are also used as a means 
of suicide, especially in less developed countries and, on occasion, as an agent of 
murder. The main symptoms of pesticide poisoning are convulsions and vomiting.
 
There are a number of different groups of pesticides that are potentially toxic 
to people. For example, the organophosphorus compounds (also known as 
organophosphates) were developed as more selective and less persistent alternatives 
to organochlorine insecticides such as DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane). 
Unfortunately, accidental exposure to organophosphates has proved to be more toxic 
to humans than exposure to the organochlorines. Examples of organophosphates 
include malathion and parathion. Among the herbicides, paraquat stands out as 
being particularly toxic to humans. Oral ingestion of this contact herbicide, as a 
means of suicide, an act of murder or as a result of accident, results in a painful and 
lingering death.
7.1.6  Toxins
A toxin may be defined as any poisonous substance that is naturally produced 
by an organism, whether plant, animal, fungus or microorganism (Table 7.1). 
Thus, natural toxins constitute an extremely diverse group, in terms of both their 
chemical structure and the way in which they act upon biological systems. They may 
be taken accidentally (e.g. in contaminated food or due to mistaken identity) but 
have also been used as the means of suicide or as an agent of murder (Box 7.1).
 
One important subgroup, which is described in a little more detail here, is the 
plant alkaloids. An alkaloid may be defined as any of a group of nitrogen-containing 
organic bases found in plants and fungi. Many of the compounds belonging to this 
group have medicinal or toxic properties (depending on their type and/or dosage). 
Some, such as cocaine and the morphine-derivative heroin, are used as drugs of 
abuse (Section 7.2.2).
 
Among the alkaloids that are highly toxic to humans, and other animals, are 
aconitine (from monkshood, Aconitum napellus), atropine (found in deadly nightshade, 
Atropa belladonna) and strychnine (from the poison berry, Strychnos nux vomica). 
Death by alkaloid poisoning is agonising. In the case of strychnine, the main effect 
is muscle over-stimulation, which progressively worsens from twitching to spasms 
and convulsions, the victim being fully conscious throughout. The process includes 
contraction of the facial muscles, which pulls the victim’s face into a characteristic 
grin known as the risus sardonicus. The convulsive attacks increase in frequency until 
the victim eventually dies during one of them as a result of respiratory failure.

Georgi Markov, an acclaimed writer in his native 
Bulgaria, defected to the UK in 1971. Subsequently, he 
worked as a broadcast journalist for a number of radio 
stations, including the BBC World Service, and used 
this as a platform to criticise the communist regime 
then operative in Bulgaria.
 
On 7 September 1978, while walking to join a bus 
queue on Waterloo Bridge in London, Markov felt a sharp 
jab on the back of his right thigh. Turning, he saw a 
stranger in the act of picking up a dropped umbrella. 
The man apologised (in a voice with a foreign accent), 
summoned a taxi and left. Markov continued on his 
journey to work at the BBC. That evening, he became 
ill with a high temperature and vomiting and the next 
morning was taken to hospital. Four days later, on 11 
September 1978, Georgi Markov died. It was found that 
his white blood cell count was more than three times the 
normal value. The cause of his death was initially given 
as septicaemia (infection of the blood).
 
The circumstances of Markov’s death resulted in an 
investigation by Scotland Yard. Following post-mortem 
examination, the area of skin bearing the puncture 
wound found on his right thigh was sent to the Chemical 
Defence Establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire (now 
called the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, 
Porton Down). There, a tiny metal pellet (approx. 1.5 mm 
in diameter) was retrieved from the sample (see figure). 
The pellet had two minute holes drilled into it at 90°, 
creating an X-shaped cavity capable of holding a minute 
amount of poison (< 500 µg). Although no poison was 
found within this recess, the presence of the pellet and 
its construction indicated that the dissident had not died 
of natural causes.
 
It was thought that the pellet had been implanted 
into Markov’s thigh through the tip of the umbrella, 
which must have been specifically modified for that 
purpose. The next task was to establish the probable 
identity of the poison (no trace was detected in the 
pellet or in Markov). To be effective, the poison had 
to be extremely toxic in the minute quantity that 
the implanted pellet was capable of delivering. By a 
process of elimination, it seemed likely that ricin, one 
of the most deadly known toxins, had been used to 
murder Markov.

7.2 Drugs of abuse
There is an extensive variety of drugs of abuse, which are either produced illegally or 
diverted from licit sources. In England and Wales, the primary source of information 
concerning the extent of drug misuse, especially among young adults (aged 16–24 
years), is the British Crime Survey (BCS). This survey has been performed every two 
years 1994–2000, and annually thereafter. The latest available BCS (2009–10) reports 
that rates of drug use in the last year* were over twice as high among young adults 
(i.e. the age group 16–24 years) compared with the general adult population (i.e. aged 
16–59 years). The 2009–10 BCS states that, when questioned, 20 per cent of young 
people in England and Wales had used one or more illicit drugs, 16.1 per cent had 
used cannabis (the most widely abused drug), 5.5 per cent had used powder cocaine 
and 4.3 per cent had used ecstasy within the last year*. For further information on the 
current and changing patterns of drug use in England and Wales, the interested reader 
is referred to Drug misuse declared: findings from the 2009/2010 British Crime Survey 
(England and Wales) (see Further reading section).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ricin is a glycoprotein obtained from the waste 
material that remains after the seeds of the castor 
oil plant (Ricinus communis) are processed for their 
oil. The symptoms caused by ricin poisoning (such as 
dizziness, high temperature, vomiting and diarrhoea) 
concurred with those suffered by Markov. Moreover, 
administration of ricin to a pig (in the quantity 
thought to have been used for Markov) caused its 
death within 24 hours. A post-mortem examination 
of the pig revealed the same patterns of damage that 
were observed in the Markov case.
 
The evidence pointed to the murder of Markov by 
ricin poisoning, administered in the form of a pellet 
implanted by a suitably modified umbrella. It was 
widely thought that his assassination was carried 
out on behalf of the communist regime in his native 
Bulgaria in order to silence his vocal criticism of its 
activities. Indeed, after the fall of communism in 
Bulgaria, the incoming government admitted as much. 
However, no one has yet been brought to trial for the 
assassination of Georgi Markov.

DRUGS OF ABUSE  221
7.2.1   The legal classification of drugs of abuse within 
the UK system
The main piece of legislation controlling drugs in the UK is the Misuse of Drugs 
Act 1971. This Act is primarily aimed at preventing the unauthorised use of specific 
substances. The term controlled drug is used for any drug that is subject to this 
Act. Under this legislation, drugs are placed in one of three different categories 
(A, B or C), depending on the harm engendered by their misuse. Thus Category 
A drugs are most dangerous, while those in Category C are considered least harmful 
(and include many prescription drugs). The penalties that apply to offences concerning 
particular drugs are governed by the category to which they belong (Table 7.2).
 
Another important piece of legislation concerning drugs is the Misuse of Drugs 
Regulations 2001, which, to quote, ‘revoke and re-enact, with amendments, 
the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985, as amended’. Under the 
2001 Regulations, controlled drugs are placed into five different schedules. These 
Regulations stipulate the requirements concerning, for example, the legitimate 
distribution, production, record keeping and storage of controlled drugs, as well as 
determining whether such drugs may be made available on prescription or not.
7.2.2  Commonly abused drugs
Drugs may be broadly categorised into stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens, 
according to their impact on the central nervous system, especially on the activity 
of the brain (Table 7.3). It should be noted that, as well as the risks ascribed to the 
drugs themselves, there are secondary risks associated with drug abuse. In particular, 
the injection of drugs using unclean needles can introduce viral infections, such 
as hepatitis B and HIV, and certain bacterial diseases. For an individual addicted 
to a particular drug (or drugs), funding the habit is expensive. For example, the 
estimated annual cost for a heroin addict is £10 000, while a cocaine addict may 
need to find as much as £20 000 per annum. Drug users frequently turn to other 
criminal activities, such as theft and prostitution, in order to fund their habits.

 222  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
 
In this section, the most commonly abused drugs are each described in turn. 
Those drugs that are subject to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 are grouped together 
according to the class to which they belong (Table 7.2). Alcohol and volatile 
substances, which are not subject to this Act, are considered separately. It should 
be noted that although volatile substances are not – strictly speaking – drugs, they 
are included here as they are commonly abused for recreational purposes.
Class A drugs
Amphetamines Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, amphetamines are classified 
as Class A drugs when prepared for injection, but categorised as Class B drugs when 
in powder form. They constitute a group of synthetic stimulants that include the 
following compounds:
 amphetamine;
 methamphetamine;
 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA);
 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (known as ‘ecstasy’, see 
separate section).
The chemical structure of these examples is given in Figure 7.1. Amphetamines may 
be synthesised from a number of different precursors, either commercially available 
chemicals or plant derivatives. For example, with reference to plant-derived precursors, 
isosafrole and safrole may be used to produce MDA and MDMA while ephedrine (a 
natural stimulant) may be utilised as a starting material for methamphetamine. 
 
Amphetamines are legitimately produced for use as medicines, which are 
available only on prescription. In the UK, their clinical use is currently confined 
to the treatment of hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (a pathological 
disorder of sleep) in adults. However, in the past, amphetamines have had other 
uses, for example as appetite suppressants and cold treatments. As a prescribed 
medicine, amphetamines are taken orally. However, when abused, they may be 
self-administered in a number of different ways, namely through swallowing,

injecting, snorting or smoking. The last route is used in particular for smokable 
methamphetamine, a clear crystalline compound commonly referred to as ‘ice’.
 
The general impact of amphetamines on the body is to stimulate and arouse the 
central nervous system (CNS), thus giving rise to street names such as ‘speed’ and 
‘uppers’. The effects produced by amphetamine abuse are similar to those of cocaine 
but of longer duration. Their effects include an increase in energy, heart rate, blood 
pressure and body temperature, euphoria and a loss of appetite. As with other drugs, 
the risks associated with amphetamine abuse are influenced by the level of the dose, 
the frequency of repeated doses, the length of use and the method of administration. 
To give just two examples, intravenous administration of amphetamines may cause 
delusions and paranoia, while long-term use can lead to heart strain. 
Cocaine and crack cocaine Cocaine is one of a number of naturally occurring 
alkaloids found in the leaves of the coca plant (Figure 7.2). This evergreen shrub is 
cultivated at high altitudes primarily in South America, especially in Bolivia, Peru 
and Columbia, but is also grown in parts of tropical Asia such as Java and Sri Lanka. 
Of the four varieties of the coca plant, Erythroxylon coca var. coca (ECVC) is the 
source used for the illegal manufacture of cocaine. The extraction and isolation of 
this alkaloid from the coca leaf can be readily performed by a series of relatively 
unsophisticated techniques.

It should be noted that it is also possible to synthesise cocaine by chemical 
means. However, this method of production is costly both in financial terms and in 
the level of expertise required, compared with the extraction of naturally occurring 
cocaine from suitable plant material. Furthermore, it can result in a product of low 
purity that contains undesirable by-products. 
 
Cocaine hydrochloride is usually available as a white crystalline powder (often 
adulterated) and is known by various street names such as C, coke, Charlie and 
snow. It is usually snorted, becoming absorbed via the mucous membranes of the 
nose, but may be injected or swallowed. It can be converted into the free base 
form, known as ‘crack’ cocaine, by, for example, heating together equal weights of 
cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate in water. Crack, also known as stone 
or rock, has become an increasingly popular drug of abuse in recent years. It is 
usually smoked in a glass pipe, a method of administration that, like the intravenous 
injection of cocaine hydrochloride, leads to a rapid onset of its effects.
 
Cocaine is a powerful stimulant, similar in its effects to amphetamines. Chewing 
the dried leaves of the coca plant is, in fact, a traditional method of appeasing 
hunger, suppressing fatigue and stimulating the central nervous system. It has 
also been used as a local anaesthetic. Its stimulatory properties were recognised 
by, among others, Sigmund Freud who, in the 1880s, described euphoria and 
exhilaration among the effects occasioned by its use. The effects induced by crack 
are the same but of greater intensity and shorter duration compared with cocaine 
hydrochloride. There are many medical complications associated with cocaine 
intoxication and abuse, including stroke, renal failure and respiratory arrest.
E c s t a s y  Ecstasy is the name given to the compound 3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine (MDMA) (Figure 7.1d). This synthetic drug is the N-methyl ana-
logue of the amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). 
Ecstasy became popular in the mid-1980s among young people and is particularly 
associated with the ‘rave’ scene. It is known by a number of other street names 
including Adam, disco biscuits, doves, E, hug drug, M&M and XTC. Another recrea-
tional drug, MDEA (3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine), is an analogue of MDMA. 
Commonly known as Eve, its effects on the individual are similar to those described 
below for ecstasy.
 
Ecstasy is available in capsule or tablet form (of various sizes, shapes and colours) 
and is usually swallowed, although it may be smoked, or crushed and snorted. It 
is an hallucinogen and as such is capable of producing changes in the conscious 
mind. Among the psychological effects experienced by users are a heightened sense 
of emotion and awareness, and an increased empathy with their companions. Under 
the influence of ecstasy, users are often able to dance for hours without stopping. 
Other, less welcome, psychological effects include depression, aggressive outbursts, 
panic attacks and paranoia. There are numerous medical effects associated with 
ecstasy use including nausea, muscle tension, blurred vision, trismus (involuntary 
clenching of the jaw) and an increased heart rate and blood pressure. Furthermore, 
the use of ecstasy can lead to potentially fatal complications such as cardiovascular 
collapse, seizures, dehydration, hyperthermia (overheating) and hyponatraemia. 
The last is a condition in which low sodium levels in the blood cause a reduction in 
its osmotic potential. This causes excess fluids in the body tissues, most notably in 
the brain, which can lead to seizures and death.
Heroin Heroin is mixture of compounds synthesised from opium. Opium is the dried 
latex collected from the field poppy Papaver somniferum L. by slitting the unripe seed

capsules and allowing the bitter, milky liquid to exude, dry and oxidise in the Sun. It 
is estimated by the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) that almost 
80 per cent of the global illicit cultivation of P. somniferum occurs in just one country 
– Afghanistan. However, the opium poppy is also clandestinely cultivated in a number 
of other Southwest Asian countries (e.g. Pakistan and Iran) and in other regions of 
the world, namely Southeast Asia (especially Burma (Myanmar)), Central America 
(primarily Guatemala and Mexico) and South America (Columbia).
 
To produce heroin, morphine is isolated from opium and then reacted with 
an acetylating agent, preferably acetic anhydride but sometimes acetyl chloride. 
The main active component of heroin is diacetylmorphine, commonly known 
as diamorphine (Figure 7.3). Note that in the United States, the terms heroin, 
diacetylmorphine and diamorphine are used synonymously. 
 
Heroin is available on the street as a powder, which may be white or brown 
in colour depending on its purity and the type(s) of other substances present. 
It may be diluted with one or more of a number of cutting agents such as milk 
powder, various sugars, caffeine and other drugs, for example barbiturates or the 
non-barbiturate depressant methaqualone. Heroin has a number of street names 
including brown, gear, H, horse, junk and smack. The percentage by weight of 
diamorphine in street heroin varies considerably. Average values are 35 to 41 per 
cent but levels range from 1 to 98 per cent. Pharmaceutical-grade diamorphine has 
a purity value greater than 99.5 per cent.
 
Heroin is highly soluble in water, which makes it particularly suitable for 
intravenous or intramuscular injection. Other routes of administration are smoking 
or snorting (correctly termed nasal insufflation). Whatever route is employed, the 
onset of the effects of heroin abuse is rapid.
 
Heroin is a powerful analgesic (i.e. painkiller), which exerts a depressing effect 
on the CNS. Individuals usually feel relaxed, drowsy and lethargic as a result of 
heroin use and, sometimes, experience feelings of euphoria. Other effects include 
suppression of the cough reflex, respiratory depression, sweating, nausea and 
blurred vision. An overdose can induce coma, which may consequently lead to 
death. Box 7.2 describes the case of Dr Harold Shipman, a general practitioner who 
used injections of pharmaceutical-grade diamorphine to murder his victims.
 
Heroin is a highly addictive drug that causes both psychological and physical 
dependence. The main treatment for heroin addicts trying to break their habit, and 
overcome the symptoms associated with withdrawal, involves the use of methadone 
as a heroin substitute. This synthetic opiate is actually more addictive than heroin 
but as its route of administration is oral (either taken in a syrup or in tablet form), 
the dangers associated with heroin injection are removed.

 226  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
Harold Frederick Shipman (born 14 January 1946) 
graduated from Leeds University Medical School in 1970 
and began work at Pontefract General Infirmary. In 1974, 
he left to join a group practice in Todmorden, Lancashire, 
UK, as a general practitioner. It was during this time that 
he began to suffer from blackouts. His colleagues at the 
practice discovered that he was addicted to pethidine 
(an opiate used as a painkiller) and had been falsifying 
prescriptions in order to obtain it for his own use. 
Although he was fired by the practice and heavily fined, 
he was not struck off by the General Medical Council 
(GMC). In the last quarter of 1975, Harold Shipman was 
treated for his addiction to pethidine at The Retreat, 
York. In 1977, Shipman joined another group practice, 
this time in Hyde, a suburb of Manchester. Five years 
later, in 1992, he left to set up his own single-handed 
GP practice in Market Street, Hyde. His list of patients 
exceeded 3000, attesting to his popularity as a doctor 
and the high regard in which he was held.
 
However, there was growing concern, from a number 
of different quarters, about the high number of deaths 
among Shipman’s patients, compared with those of other 
local general practitioners in Hyde. These concerns were 
expressed to the Coroner in March 1998 by a local GP. 
Many of the deaths were of elderly women and many of 
these lived alone. It was the unexpected death of another 
of Shipman’s patients, Kathleen Grundy, a fit and active 
81-year-old widow, on 24 June 1998 that finally brought 
matters to a head. The emergence of a new will, sent on 
the day of Mrs Grundy’s death to a local firm of solicitors, 
aroused the suspicions of her daughter, who was herself 
a solicitor (and whose firm usually handled Mrs Grundy’s 
legal affairs). In this document, which was poorly typed 
and phrased, Kathleen Grundy bequeathed her entire 
estate (valued at nearly £400 000) to Shipman and not, as 
in her original will, to her family. Mrs Grundy’s daughter 
contacted the police about her suspicions that the newly 
amended version of her mother’s will was a forgery.
 
A decision was taken to exhume the body of Kathleen 
Grundy in order to perform a post-mortem examination. 
Toxicological tests revealed the presence of morphine, a 
metabolite of diamorphine formed almost instantly when 
diamorphine enters the bloodstream. As a consequence 
of this discovery, Shipman was arrested on 7 September 
1998 for the murder of Kathleen Grundy. In the wake  
of his arrest, other people came forward to say that  
they too were concerned about the circumstances  
surrounding the deaths of their relatives, who were 
Shipman’s patients. Certain patterns began to emerge. 
The deceased individuals were frequently described 
as being fit and active in life. Death had been sudden  
or unexpected. Furthermore, Dr Shipman was usually 
reported to be present on the day of death (either 
attending the patient before or even at the time of 
death) or discovering the body afterwards. The number 
of potential victims continued to grow and the evidence 
against Shipman began to mount, including the discovery 
at his practice of the typewriter used to produce the 
supposed last will of Mrs Kathleen Grundy.
 
On 5 October 1999, the trial of Harold Shipman for 
the murder of 15 elderly patients, including Kathleen 
Grundy, began at Preston Crown Court. On 31 January 
2000, Shipman was convicted of killing all 15 with lethal 
injections of diamorphine and of forging the will of Mrs 
Kathleen Grundy. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. 
In June 2001, a public inquiry, chaired by the High Court 
judge Dame Janet Smith, began into the circumstances 
surrounding the deaths of 493 of Shipman’s patients 
between 1974 and 1998. The first report of this inquiry, 
published on 19 July 2002, concluded that Shipman had 
murdered 215 of his patients (including the 15 for which 
he was convicted) and was strongly suspected of being 
responsible for the deaths of 45 more. A series of reports 
followed, culminating in the sixth report of the Shipman 
Inquiry (published on 27 January 2005), in which 
Dame Janet Smith focused mainly on Shipman’s time 
as a junior doctor at the Pontefract General Infirmary 
(1970–74). At the end of this final report, she gave the 
following overall conclusion: ‘that Shipman killed about 
250 patients between 1971 and 1998, of whom I have 
been able positively to identify 218’.
 
Meanwhile, on 13 January 2004, Dr Harold Shipman 
was found hanging in his cell at 6.20 a.m. and was 
pronounced dead after attempts to resuscitate him 
failed.

closely related alkaloid found in the seeds of the morning glory (Ipomoea spp.) and 
the Hawaiian baby woodrose (Argyreia nervosa)). Its chemical structure is shown in 
Figure 7.4. 
 
The hallucinogenic properties of LSD were first discovered in 1943. In the 1950s 
and 1960s, LSD found some use as a therapeutic drug in, for example, the treatment 
of alcoholism, but is no longer used medically in any capacity. Its popularity as a 
drug of abuse has declined and it is currently encountered with relative infrequency. 
LSD may be supplied illegally in a number of different forms, including microdots 
(small, vividly coloured tablets) and blotter acids (small squares of absorbent paper 
impregnated with LSD, often carrying imprinted designs).
 
Dosage units vary between 50 and 300 g but even 20–25 g is sufficient to induce 
its hallucinogenic effects. LSD is usually taken orally and absorption occurs very 
quickly. On an LSD ‘trip’, which can last for up to 12 hours, characteristic effects 
experienced by the user will usually include an alteration in his or her visual perception 
and time distortion. The physical and psychological effects of LSD abuse are related to 
the size of dose taken. If this is very high, the potential life-threatening risks include 
respiratory arrest and hyperthermia (i.e. overheating). Some LSD users may experience 
‘flashbacks’ up to several years after they have discontinued use of the drug.
Class B drugs
Barbiturates Barbiturates are derivatives of barbituric acid (2,4,6-trioxohexa-
hydropyrimidine), which was first synthesised in 1864. They were prescribed for 
use as anaesthetics, anticonvulsants, sedatives and hypnotics. However, their use, 
particularly in the latter two capacities, has been replaced almost completely by 
the benzodiazepines, following the high rate of barbiturate abuse in the 1960s. 
Currently, the only licensed use of barbiturates is thiopental, used as a general 
anaesthetic, and phenobarbitone (also known as phenobarbital) and primadone for 
the control of epilepsy. Consequently, barbiturate abuse is now very rare.
 
Barbiturates are usually encountered in the form of capsules or tablets. Those 
available on the illicit market have almost invariably been legally manufactured 
and subsequently diverted for illicit use. Barbiturates are depressants, that is they 
have a depressing effect on the CNS. In general, users feel relaxed and sleepy as

a consequence of taking barbiturates. Individual members of this large family of 
drugs may be short-acting (e.g. secobarbital), medium-acting (e.g. butobarbitone) 
and long-acting (e.g. phenobarbitone). Prolonged barbiturate use, especially at 
levels higher than prescription levels, can cause physical dependence. Withdrawal 
symptoms, experienced after barbiturate use has ceased, may include convulsions, 
delirium and insomnia.
Cannabis Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug in England and Wales, 
in the United States and indeed throughout the world. It is derived from the annual 
plant Cannabis sativa L., which has a worldwide distribution. Cannibis sativa is grown 
commercially as hemp and its fibres used for the production of rope and cloth. In this 
form, it consists predominantly of stalks with only a small amount of foliage present 
compared with wild plants and those cultivated illegally for cannabis production.
 
Cannabis is a mild hallucinogen. The active components of cannabis responsible 
for its hallucinogenic properties are the tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs), especially 
D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC) (Figure 7.5). These are concentrated in the 
leaves and flowering tops of the cannabis plant. As far as cannabis for illegal use is 
concerned, the concentration of THCs present (usually expressed as a percentage 
by weight) is determined by the form in which it is supplied (see below):
 Herbal cannabis (also known as marijuana). In this form, the dried, crushed 
leaves are mixed with other parts of the cannabis plant such as the flowers 
and seeds. Herbal cannabis has the lowest concentration of THCs compared 
with other commonly encountered preparations.
 Cannabis resin (also known as hashish). The surface of the cannabis plant is 
covered in resin, which can be obtained by processing the herbal material in 
some way. For example, the seeds, leaves and resin can be separated from the 
rest of the plant material by threshing and the mixture then sieved to yield 
its resinous component. Cannabis resin is usually supplied in the form of 
compressed slabs or cakes. In terms of THC concentration, it is intermediate 
between the herbal and oil forms.
 Cannabis oil (also known as hashish oil or hemp oil). This dark-coloured oil or 
tar-like substance is obtained by solvent extraction from either cannabis resin 
or the crude plant material. It is often potent, with the highest concentration 
of THCs of the three forms listed.

It should be noted that there are other forms of cannabis than those given above, 
for example sinsemilla (the unfertilised flowering tops of female C. sativa) and Thai 
sticks (marijuana leaves wrapped around bamboo stems).
 
Cannabis products are usually smoked either on their own or in combination with 
tobacco but may be self-administered in other ways; for example, cannabis resin 
may be consumed with food. The effects of smoking cannabis usually commence 
within 10–20 minutes and last for between 2 and 3 hours. They include a feeling 
of relaxation, sleepiness and a lack of concentration. There are a number of risks 
associated with chronic cannabis use such as apathy and low energy levels, while 
high doses can induce hallucinations, panic attacks and psychosis.
 
In January 2009, cannabis was returned to its earlier Class B status, having spent 
5 years classified as a Class C drug (January 2004–January 2009).
Class C drugs
Anabolic steroids Anabolic steroids are synthetic compounds, the majority of 
which are chemically similar to the male sex hormone, testosterone. This naturally 
occurring steroid hormone is responsible in males for the differentiation of the male 
sexual organs, the development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty and 
for the maintenance of sexual function in adults. Testosterone also promotes muscle 
growth.
 
Anabolic steroids are legally available on prescription and are used, for example, 
in the treatment of anaemia. Many are manufactured for use as veterinary drugs. The 
illegal use of anabolic steroids occurs primarily among individuals involved in sport, 
athletics or bodybuilding (at both amateur and professional level). These drugs, 
in combination with a specific diet and a programme of intensive training, help to 
accelerate muscle growth and increase body mass, thus enhancing the performance, 
or appearance, of the individual. Anabolic steroids are available as tablets or capsules 
but are more usually administered, in liquid form, as an intramuscular injection.
 
Anabolic steroids have a number of unwanted adverse effects. Among the harmful 
effects reported in males are liver damage, impotency, sterility and heart attack, 
while females may develop masculine characteristics, such as deepening of the voice 
and facial hair growth. There is also risk of miscarriage or stillbirth for women. 
In teenagers, the use of anabolic steroids may prevent normal bone growth. In 
addition, mood-swings, aggression, depression and memory effects are all associated 
with anabolic steroid abuse.
Benzodiazepines  Benzodiazepines are manufactured legally as prescription 
drugs, usually as tablets or capsules. They are used as anticonvulsants, hypnotics 
and tranquillisers. This large group of lipophilic acids includes chlordiazepoxide, 
diazepam (Valium), temazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam and nitrazepam. The 
chemical structure of the first three examples is shown in Figure 7.6.
 
In the UK, there are vast amounts of illegal benzodiazepines available on the black 
market, particularly diazepam and temazepam. Illegal users of benzodiazepines 
may also be abusers of other types of drugs, such as heroin and/or amphetamines. 
Benzodiazepines have a number of street names, including moggies and, with 
reference to specific jelly capsules (usually temazepam), jellies.
Chronic

 230  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
 
Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally but, when abused, are sometimes 
dissolved and injected, which is a highly dangerous practice. The effects of their 
use are dependent on their type (benzodiazepines, like barbiturates, act for 
different lengths of time), the amount used and the administration route involved. 
Benzodiazepines are depressants and users usually experience a reduction in tension 
and anxiety, and feelings of lethargy and drowsiness. One in particular, flunitrazepam, 
has been associated with instances of ‘date rape’, where the drug is surreptitiously 
slipped into the drink of the intended victim. The metabolism of this short-acting 
benzodiazepine is rapid, therefore making subsequent detection difficult.
 
There are a number of risks associated with benzodiazepine use; for example, 
overdose may induce convulsions. Benzodiazepines can cause physical and 
psychological dependence. Long-term users may experience withdrawal symptoms, 
such as panic attacks, tremor and insomnia, after cessation of benzodiazepine use.
Alcohol
An alcohol is an organic compound with the general formula ROH, where R is an 
alkyl group. In common usage, and for the purposes of this book, the term alcohol 
refers to ethanol (Figure 7.7), which is the alcohol present in alcoholic drinks. The 
concentration of ethanol in alcoholic beverages varies according to the production 
process. This concentration is usually expressed as a volume/volume percentage (% 
v/v). Those produced by fermentation alone appear at the lower end of the scale, 
for example beer and cider usually fall in the range 3–6% v/v, while table wines 
normally have alcohol contents of 9–12% v/v. Fortified wines (e.g. port and sherry) 
have higher concentration, typically 17–21% v/v. Finally, those drinks produced 
by distillation of the liquid produced by fermentation (e.g. spirits such as vodka, 
whisky and gin) typically have alcohol concentrations of about 40% v/v in the UK. 
Alcohol is the most widely used, and abused, drug in the world.
 
Alcohol is a depressant, that is it has a depressing effect on the CNS. Its effects 
on the behaviour of an individual can be roughly correlated with the level of alcohol 
present in the body, as measured by blood–alcohol concentration (BAC) (Table 7.4). 
However, it should be emphasised that there is a wide variation in the behaviour of

individuals at different BAC levels, depending on the rate of absorption, tolerance 
to alcohol and even the time of day. Alcohol misuse is known to increase the risk of 
accident (especially involving motor vehicles) and to be a significant contributory 
factor in many cases of assault and murder. Furthermore, excessive and/or long-
term consumption can lead to alcohol-induced disease, especially of the liver.
 
After consumption, alcohol is absorbed through the stomach and small intestine 
into the bloodstream. The rate of alcohol absorption is influenced by a number of 
different factors, such as the concentration and amount of alcohol consumed, and 
the presence, or otherwise, of food in the stomach. Once absorbed, it is circulated 
by the blood to all parts of the body. The elimination of alcohol from the body takes 
longer than its absorption. This occurs principally via metabolism in the liver, with 
a small percentage excreted unchanged in the urine, sweat and breath.
 
There are strict legal limits for the maximum concentration of alcohol that 
is allowed in the breath, blood or urine of drivers. Current UK limits for these 
parameters are 35 g/100 ml, 80 mg/100 ml and 107 mg/100 ml respectively. In 
cases of suspected drink-driving, there may be some delay between the possible 
offence and samples being taken for analysis. Under these conditions, it may be 
necessary for back-calculations to be performed in order to establish whether the 
individual was over the limit at the time of driving (Box 7.3).
Volatile substances
Volatile substance abuse (sometimes referred to as solvent abuse or glue-sniffing) 
is mainly associated with adolescents. A variety of different substances are used 
for this purpose including aerosol propellants (found, for example, in aerosol 
deodorants and hairsprays), butane and propane (gases used in cigarette lighters 
and their refills), paint, paint thinners, glue and correction fluids.
 
Volatile substances may be self-administered in a number of different ways, 
depending on type. For example, they may be inhaled through the nose or mouth 
from a plastic bag, sniffed from a piece of cloth or clothing, or sprayed directly into

 232  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
In cases in which an individual is suspected of drink-
driving and in which a blood sample is to be taken for 
analysis, there is an inevitable delay between the time of 
the suspected offence and the collection of the sample. In 
some cases, this delay will be sufficient for a significant 
alteration to have occurred in the concentration of 
alcohol in the blood. However, under such circumstances 
it is normally possible to estimate what the concentration 
was at the time of the incident by back-extrapolation.
 
The process of absorption of alcohol from the 
gut into the blood is relatively rapid. While the time 
taken to complete this process is altered by a number 
of factors, such as the amount of food taken with the 
alcoholic drink, it is likely to have ceased once more 
than 2 hours have passed since the last alcoholic drink 
was consumed. If the incident in question occurred after 
this time, it is likely that the alcohol concentration in 
the blood will have passed its peak before the incident. 
Consequently, the concentration that is found in any 
blood samples subsequently taken for analysis would be 
lower than at the time of the incident. However, if, at 
the time of the incident, alcohol was still being absorbed 
into the blood from the gut, it is likely that the blood–
alcohol concentration will have risen after the incident, 
although it may have fallen from its maximum level 
before the samples for analysis were taken. Clearly, back-
extrapolation in cases in which the absorption process 
was occurring at the time of the suspected offence is 
likely to be more difficult than in cases in which it may 
safely be assumed that absorption had ceased by the 
time of the incident. This box will only be concerned 
with calculations for straightforward cases in which such 
an assumption can be made and where no alcohol was 
consumed between the incident and the time at which 
the blood sample was taken.
 
In most cases, the rate of elimination of alcohol 
from the blood (ß) is essentially constant in any one 
individual. Therefore, once the alcohol absorption 
process has ceased, the blood–ethanol concentration 
at some initial time (C0) can be calculated from its 
concentration at a later time (Ct), provided that both ß 
and the time interval (t) that has elapsed between the 
initial and later times are known, thus:
C0 = Ct + tß
in which C0 and Ct are measured in mg of ethanol per 
100 ml of blood, t is in hours and ß is measured in mg of 
ethanol per 100 ml of blood per hour.
 
Unfortunately, ß varies significantly from one person 
to the next. There have been a number of studies that 
have examined this variation. From these, it has been 
estimated that the lowest likely rate of elimination is 
12.5 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood per hour, whereas 
the highest likely rate is 25 mg of ethanol per 100 ml 
of blood per hour, and the average rate is 18.7 mg of 
ethanol per 100 ml of blood per hour (Ferner, 1996).
 
In order to illustrate how use may be made of this 
information, consider a hypothetical case in which a 
man is arrested after driving a car that was involved in 
a road traffic accident at 3.00 a.m. Assume that there 
are reliable eyewitnesses that confirm that the driver 
last drank an alcoholic drink at least two hours earlier. A 
blood sample was taken at 5.00 a.m. that same morning 
which showed a blood–alcohol concentration of 70 mg of 
ethanol per 100 ml. Was the driver likely to be over the 
limit of 80 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood at the time 
of the accident?
 
Given the length of time between the last alcoholic 
drink and the accident, an assumption can be made that 
the ethanol absorption process from the gut to the blood 
has ceased. At the lowest likely elimination rate, the 
blood–alcohol concentration at the time of the accident 
(C0) would be:
C0 = Ct + tß = 70 + 2 × 12.5 
                  = 95 mg/100 ml
Using identical reasoning, at the highest rate of elimin-
ation it would be 120 mg/100 ml, while at the average 
rate it would be 107.4 mg/100 ml.
 
Therefore, it is likely that the man was above the 
legal limit for drink-driving at the time of the accident.

the back of the throat. In any such case, after inhalation, the substance concerned 
is absorbed through the lungs and reaches the brain very quickly. The initial effects 
usually experienced by the user are of euphoria and exhilaration. However, these 
substances are essentially depressants of the CNS and the initial ‘high’ is followed 
by, for example, dizziness, blurred vision and slurred speech, and, eventually, stupor. 
Other effects, such as nausea, blackouts and vomiting, may also occur. 
 
The abuse of volatile substances is not thought to cause physical dependence. 
However, there are many risks associated with this practice. These include an 
increased risk of accident while intoxicated, permanent liver and kidney damage 
(through chronic abuse) and brain damage (through long-term abuse, i.e. over 
a decade). Moreover, fatalities may occur, for example, through choking on own 
vomit or heart failure.
 
As can be seen from the list given at the beginning of this section, those volatile 
substances that are commonly abused are items that have legitimate use in everyday 
life. However, under the Intoxicating Substance (Supply) Act 1985, it is illegal for 
such products to be sold to anyone under the age of 18 if it is suspected that the 
intended purpose of the purchase is abuse. More recently, the Cigarette Lighter 
Refill (Safety) Regulations 1999 have made the sale of butane gas lighter refills to 
any individual under the age of 18 an offence.
7.3 Factors affecting toxicity
The toxicity of a substance is related to its dose, a fact recognised by the Swiss 
chemist, physician and natural philosopher Paracelsus (1493–1541). He stated 
that ‘All substances are poisons; there is none that is not a poison. The right dose 
differentiates a poison from a remedy.’ Thus, virtually all substances are poisonous 
if taken in sufficiently large amounts; even water, imperative for the maintenance of 
life, can be harmful if several litres are drunk in rapid succession.
 
The level of dose required to elicit a response in an organism is dependent on the 
toxic properties of the substance in question. Responses may be classed as graded, as 
measured by a parameter such as the level of some type of pathological damage (e.g. 
necrosis of the liver cells) or ‘all-or-none’ as in death. In the latter case, plotting the 
percentage response of a group of animals (or cells) against the log of the dosage (i.e. 
the dose per unit weight or surface area of the target organism) produces a typical 
S-shaped (or sigmoid) curve (Figure 7.8). This is known as the dose–response curve 
and can be used to determine the LD50. This measure may be defined as the dose at 
which 50 per cent of the test organisms die. It may be used, for example, to examine 
the effect of different administration routes on the toxicity of a particular substance, 
or to compare the relative toxicity of different substances (although alternative 
measures, such as fixed dose testing, are currently being considered). The results from 
toxicity testing on laboratory animals may be used to gauge, by extrapolation, the 
likely effects that exposure to such substances will have on humans, although there is 
a wide variation in the susceptibility of people to toxic substances.
 
It is important to realise that the toxicity of a substance is determined not only by 
its inherent toxic properties but also by a number of factors relating to the individual 
exposed to it. For example, poor health and advanced years are both factors that might 

 
 234  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
be expected to increase a person’s vulnerability to toxic substances. Also, previous 
exposure to a particular substance can have a significant effect on how an individual 
reacts to the next dose. This may lead to one of the three following scenarios:
 Sensitisation. Prior exposure to a particular substance may lead to the 
development of sensitisation when an individual encounters it for a second 
time. This is characterised by an enhanced immune response. If the 
immune response is excessive or inappropriate, the condition is termed 
hypersensitivity and is exemplified by anaphylactic shock, which may result in 
the death of the individual. 
 Tolerance. This condition may develop when an individual is repeatedly 
exposed to a particular substance. Consequently, the dose must be either 
increased or given more frequently in order to have the same effect as 
when it was first administered. Drugs such as amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepines and opiates (e.g. heroin and morphine) can all lead to the 
development of tolerance. Tolerance may be lost after abstention from the 
substance in question and resumption of the drug habit at levels previously 
tolerated may have serious or even fatal results. Heroin users returning to old 
habits after a period in prison are particularly vulnerable to this risk.
 Accumulation. The time taken for the concentration or amount of a poison 
in the body (or a given part of the body) to halve is called the half-life, t1/2. 
Some poisons, known as cumulative poisons, have values of t1/2 that are 
long enough to allow chronic exposure to sublethal doses to lead to the 
accumulation of the poison within the body. If, in a given case, both the rate 
of intake is sufficiently high and t1/2 is long enough, the amount of poison

in the body will eventually become large enough to cause ill health and, 
possibly, death. Heavy metals such as lead and mercury, and the metalloid 
arsenic, are well-known cumulative poisons.
It should be noted that some substances, for example aspirin, cocaine, heroin and 
penicillin, may elicit an idiosyncratic response in a few individuals. Idiosyncrasy may 
have fatal results and is due to the genetic make-up of the individual concerned. 
Finally, the dose of a toxin that will cause the death of an individual may be lowered 
if another toxic substance is present in the body. It is known, for example, that the 
presence of alcohol exacerbates the toxic effects of benzodiazepines.
7.4 Routes of uptake and elimination 
  
 of drugs and other toxic substances
The toxic effect of a potentially poisonous substance is not exerted until that 
material encounters a biological system. Such substances may enter the body by 
one or more of the routes of uptake outlined below:
 Ingestion. In this route of uptake, potentially toxic materials are taken into 
the gastrointestinal tract through the mouth. Examples include the many 
drugs that are administered orally (during either abuse or therapeutic use) 
and toxins present in foodstuffs (as a result of either accident or design).
 Inhalation. This process involves the intake of gases, vapours and/or particles 
into the lungs. This may result from accidental exposure, for example to 
carbon monoxide in the ambient environment, or deliberate activity, as 
exemplified by the abuse of solvents (Section 7.2.2).
 Skin contact. The skin forms an effective barrier against many potentially 
toxic materials. However, some poisonous substances, for example phenol 
and organic mercury compounds, are capable of penetrating this barrier.
 Mucous membrane contact. Substances may be deliberately introduced into 
the body via contact with those mucous membranes that are externally 
accessible. Such sites are present at several locations in the body and include 
the eyes, ears, mouth, nose and rectum. In drug abuse, one of the ways of 
administration used for amphetamines, cocaine and heroin is that of snorting 
the material up the nose or, as it is more correctly termed, nasal insufflation. 
 Injection. Injection involves the deliberate introduction of a compound 
directly into the body, generally by means of a hypodermic syringe. The 
substance may be administered into a vein (i.e. intravenously) or into a 
muscle (i.e. intramuscularly). It may also be administered under the skin (i.e. 
subcutaneously) or into the skin (i.e. intradermally). Injection is commonly 
used for therapeutic purposes or during the abuse of drugs such as heroin 
or cocaine. On rare occasions, however, the injection of a poison or a drug 
has been used as a means of murder, as exemplified by the assassination of 
Georgi Markov (Box 7.1) and the killings committed by Harold Shipman (Box 
7.2) respectively.

 
 236  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
 
In toxicological terms, the absorption of a substance is considered to have 
occurred when it enters the general blood circulation of the body. In the case of 
intravenous injections, administration occurs directly but in other routes of uptake, 
the process involves transference of the substance concerned across cell membranes 
into the surrounding blood vessels. The bioavailability of a particular substance 
may be described as the proportion of the original dose that is absorbed and the 
rate at which this absorption takes place. This is influenced, for example, by the 
chemical and physical attributes of the substance concerned and the route of uptake 
used. Importantly, substances absorbed from the intestine have to encounter the 
liver (the key metabolic organ) before entering the general circulation. Numerous 
drugs are rendered inactive by the liver and consequently their bioavailability tends 
to be low. This process is known as first-pass metabolism.
 
After absorption, compounds are distributed around the body by the circulation 
of the blood. Distribution is followed by elimination. The nature of the poison 
concerned will dictate how this may occur. Water-soluble substances can be 
removed from the body in the urine (after passing through the kidneys) and in the 
bile (after processing by the liver). Volatile compounds can be removed in expired 
air from the lungs. However, fat-soluble poisons must first be metabolised into 
water-soluble species before they can be lost from the body in urine or bile. Note 
that bile is discharged into the gut for elimination with the faeces. However, a 
proportion may be reabsorbed in the gut, carried back to the liver and discharged 
once more into the gastrointestinal tract. This recycling (known as enterohepatic 
recirculation) can result in the retention of certain substances such as cannabis 
metabolites within the body for extended periods, which may have important 
implications for toxicological analysis.
7.5 The analysis of drugs and other poisons
7.5.1  The information sought by analysis
The analysis of a sample for drugs of abuse and/or other poisonous substances aims 
to provide information about one or more of the following: the chemical identity of 
any poisons present, the concentration of such substances and/or their amounts. In 
the forensic context, this information can be used in a variety of ways. Importantly, 
it can establish the following:
 Whether a particular sample contains a controlled substance or other poison.
 Whether the concentration of a particular substance within given samples of 
body fluids and/or tissue is consistent with therapeutic administration (in 
the case of drugs that have medicinal applications), intoxication or death 
by poisoning with the substance concerned. For example, it can establish 
whether the concentration of ethanol in a given sample of breath, blood or 
urine exceeds the legally permissible limit for driving (currently 35 g/100 
ml, 80 mg/100 ml and 107 mg/100 ml respectively in the UK).
Bioavailability

the original dose 
that is absorbed and 
the rate at which 
this absorption 
takes place.

 
THE ANALYSIS OF DRUGS AND OTHER POISONS  237
Hence, the analytical results can help the courts to establish whether a crime has 
been committed, the nature of that crime and whether the accused is guilty of the 
offence(s) for which he or she is being tried. For example, qualitative analysis may 
reveal that a powder is heroin (Section 7.2.2). If the courts are convinced that this 
powder was confiscated from the accused, he or she may be convicted of the illegal 
possession of a controlled substance. Furthermore, quantitative analysis may help 
the courts to establish whether the amount of heroin seized was consistent with 
personal use by the individual concerned or with the intent to supply the drug to 
others. In the latter case, the accused may be convicted of a more serious offence 
and consequently be given a more substantial sentence.
 
Analytical data can also corroborate or refute the account of events as given by the 
accused, an eyewitness or a victim. For example, in a murder trial, the accused may 
claim he had been drinking with the victim and that the victim had consumed large 
quantities of alcohol prior to attacking the accused, who then killed the victim while 
acting in self-defence. In order to help test the accuracy of this account of the incident, 
post-mortem analysis of the blood–alcohol level of the victim may be compared with 
the level expected on the basis of the scenario described by the accused. 
 
Post-mortem analysis of body fluids and/or tissues for drugs and other poisons 
can help establish the cause of death and, in some cases, the sequence of events that 
occurred immediately before death. This is exemplified by the post-mortem analysis 
of blood for carbon monoxide in apparent fire victims. High levels of this poison, 
coupled with smoke blackening of the airways, indicate that the deceased was alive 
and breathing when the fire was under way. However, low levels of carbon monoxide in 
the blood, together with a lack of smoke blackening of the airways, may indicate that 
death occurred prior to the fire. Post-mortem analysis may also reveal the presence of 
drugs at therapeutic levels within the deceased. Such information may help to establish 
the chain of events that occurred before death and, possibly, assist in the identification 
of an unknown body. The interpretation of the results of post-mortem analysis requires 
great care, however. For example, someone who dies in a very rapidly developing fire 
may do so before inhaling significant quantities of smoke or carbon monoxide. Also, 
biochemical changes that occur in the body after death can result in the redistribution 
of substances between different biological materials. For example, drugs and/or their 
metabolites can be transferred from the tissues to the blood, leading to elevated levels 
in the latter. Thus, therapeutic doses may lead to levels in post-mortem blood samples 
that would be potentially lethal if present in the blood of a living person. Clearly, 
it is also important to be mindful of the biochemical changes that occur to a drug 
or other poison once it is in the body. For example, once in the blood, diamorphine 
(the principal active component of street heroin) is very quickly hydrolysed to 
6-monoacetylmorphine. This, in turn, is more slowly metabolised to morphine. Hence, 
the post-mortem analysis of blood is unlikely to find diamorphine, even in cases of 
death by heroin overdose. However, in such cases, high levels of 6-monoacetylmorphine 
and morphine in the blood will indicate the true cause of death.
 
Samples taken from living people can be analysed to screen for the presence of 
banned substances. Such screening is used to test athletes, employees whose contracts 
of employment stipulate that they are prohibited from using certain drugs, people 
undergoing substance abuse rehabilitation programmes and prisoners.
 
Significantly, the analysis of the chemical composition of seized illicit drugs can 
reveal intelligence information. This is because these street drugs are not chemically

pure but are mixtures of different components. One or more of these components 
will have the drug action desired by the user. However, others will be present as 
impurities that have originated in the raw materials from which the drug was formed, 
have been created as part of the isolation or synthesis of the drug, or have been 
deliberately added as diluents. The last of these categories of impurity are collectively 
known as cutting agents. They are added in order to increase the apparent quantity 
of the drug being sold. In many cases, the nature and concentration of the impurities 
present in any one type of drug and/or the concentration of its active component are 
known to vary with both the geographical region of origin and from batch to batch. 
Hence, chemical composition information can be used to probe supply routes and 
link seized drug batches together. Also, similarities in the wrapping materials used 
to contain different portions of illicit drugs may be able to show that two or more 
samples have the same source. For example, individual doses of powdered drugs may 
be sold wrapped in paper torn from a page of a magazine. Jigsaw fits between the 
wrappings of such doses recovered by the police will provide conclusive evidence of a 
common point in their supply chain. In a similar vein, entomological techniques can 
be used to establish the geographical region of origin of seized herbal cannabis from 
the types of arthropod it contains. The sum total of the characteristics of a sample of 
illicit drugs as revealed by means of the forensic analysis of both the drugs and their 
wrappings is known as a drug profile. Clearly, drug profiling can provide valuable 
information about the operation of illicit drug supply networks.
7.5.2  The types of sample that are analysed
Both bulk samples (i.e. those large enough to be weighed) and trace samples 
are subjected to forensic analysis for drugs and other poisons. For the purposes 
described in Section 7.5.1, such samples are analysed to establish the identity, 
composition and/or quantity of one or more of their constituents. A review of the 
principal methods used to do this is given in Section 7.5.3.
 
Examples of bulk materials that are analysed include samples of seized illicit 
drugs, legal drugs in the form of tablets, capsules, etc., and samples of poisons or 
suspicious materials (e.g. liquid that is suspected of being a pesticide that has been 
stored in an old soft-drink bottle).
 
Many types of samples are analysed for trace levels of drugs or other poisons. 
Notable among these are biological samples taken from people; suspected drug-
taking paraphernalia (syringes, wrapping materials, the contents of ashtrays, etc.); 
laboratory glassware, solvents, etc. from clandestine drug synthesis or purification 
operations; food or drink that may have been adulterated; and items (crockery, 
cutlery, containers, clothing, etc.) that have been in contact with such food or drink. 
The first of these include those samples that can be obtained from living persons, 
in particular breath, blood, urine, stomach contents, hair, nail clippings, saliva and 
sweat, and those tissues and body fluids that can be obtained during post-mortem 
examinations. The specimens taken during such examinations and submitted for 
toxicological analysis may include samples of blood from different points in the body, 
urine, liver, bile, vitreous humour (i.e. the transparent jelly-like material of the eye’s 
inner chamber), lung, brain, cerebrospinal fluid (liquid that surrounds the brain 
and spinal cord and fills the cavity within these organs), hair and nail clippings. The 
biological samples chosen for analysis will vary from case to case and will reflect:

enough to weigh.
Trace sample

that it cannot be

may well be possible 
to establish its

 those that are available (e.g. it may well not be possible to obtain urine or 
blood from a decomposed body);
 those in which the analyte can readily be identified and/or quantified 
(e.g. samples of lung and/or brain are frequently used in the detection and 
identification of volatile substances, while, in many cases, the liver is of use 
in the analysis for drugs);
 those for which there is an extensive literature to aid the interpretation 
of the analytical results (blood has a particularly comprehensive literature 
and for each of many drugs and other poisons there is a known correlation 
between concentration in blood and biological response);
 those that are acceptable for legal and ethical reasons (e.g. samples of 
breath, blood and urine are all acceptable from a legal perspective for the 
determination of alcohol levels in cases of possible drink-driving);
 whether information about chronic or acute exposure to the analyte is being 
sought (e.g. while blood may provide information about acute poisoning, a 
history of chronic or past exposure will be revealed in samples of hair if the 
poison and/or its metabolites were introduced into this tissue when it was 
formed and are retained within it).
7.5.3  Methods of analysis
The methods used to analyse for drugs and other poisons all exploit the chemical, 
physical and/or biochemical properties of the analyte of interest that allow it to be 
identified and/or quantified. Except in those cases in which the analyte is the only 
material present in the sample, the method will also have to be capable of using 
these properties to distinguish the analyte from the matrix of the sample.
Readily made observations
In all cases, analysis will start with the observation of those physical properties 
that can readily be ascertained. Normally, these will include the colour and 
morphology of the sample that may be seen with the naked eye and/or with the 
aid of a microscope. These characteristics can be highly informative. For example, 
shape, dimensions, colour and manufacturers’ marks can be used to establish the 
identity of commercially produced tablets and capsules. However, even in cases in 
which these observations lead to apparent identification, care needs to be exercised. 
This is especially true in the case of capsules, as their contents may be tampered 
with easily. Also, the items, whether tablets or capsules, may be counterfeit 
goods. Although it should be noted that experts in this field can normally readily 
detect counterfeit tablets from their appearance, this task can be made easier by 
intelligence information about trends in drugs counterfeiting.
 
Certain street drugs may, to varying degrees of certainty, be identified by their 
appearance. In some cases (e.g. herbal cannabis and ‘magic mushrooms’), an 
examination of morphology alone may be sufficient to unambiguously identify the 
material concerned. However, in most instances this is not possible. For example, 
while the fact that a sample is a pale brown powder is consistent with its being 
heroin, this is clearly not proof of its identity as these characteristics are shared by

many other substances. The common visible characteristics of the more frequently 
encountered street drugs are described in Section 7.2.2. It is noteworthy that even 
in cases in which appearance is not sufficient to identify the material, valuable 
information can be obtained from visual examination. For example, the use of a low-
power microscope may readily reveal that a given sample of powder is made up of 
two or more morphologically distinct constituents.
 
Visual examination of the packaging of both legal and street drugs can also yield 
important information. Naturally, the packaging of any legal drug will contain 
written details of the nature and original quantity of its contents. However, 
such information must be treated with caution. This is because the contents 
of the packaging may have been altered in some way, the packaging and/or its 
contents may be counterfeit or mistakes may have occurred when the drug was 
being packaged. Consequently, in order to identify the contents without doubt, 
confirmatory information based on its appearance and/or its chemical composition 
is needed. As mentioned in Section 7.5.1, in the case of street drugs, packaging 
has the potential to provide evidence that links different samples together, thereby 
demonstrating that they have a common source.
 
The physical appearance of food and drink that is suspected of being tampered 
with, as well as that of body fluids submitted for toxicological analysis, can also be 
informative, as can any unusual odour associated with these materials. For example, 
poisonous rat-bait is frequently coloured red, green or blue, and the presence of 
such colours in food may alert the analyst to the possibility of its contamination 
with such bait. A number of poisons have characteristic odours, in which case smell 
may be a useful indicator of their presence, whether in food, drink or stomach 
contents. Examples of such poisons include, cyanide and many volatile organic 
compounds. Clearly, smell alone will not be sufficient to identify unequivocally the 
material concerned.
Presumptive tests
Once their readily observed physical characteristics have been noted, bulk samples will, 
in many cases, be subjected to presumptive tests. These tests are designed to quickly 
and cheaply indicate the presence of certain analytes (i.e. they provide qualitative but 
not quantitative information). They most commonly take the form of colour tests. 
During these, a small amount of the sample is treated with reagents that are known 
to produce characteristic colours on reacting with the analyte of interest, thereby 
indicating a positive result. These tests are rarely completely specific. That is, most 
will produce a positive result with any one of a range of different chemical species. 
Nonetheless, it may be possible to narrow down this range, as, in many cases, the 
exact colour produced will vary from one chemical species to another. However, the 
interpretation of the colour of the reaction remains somewhat subjective and is not 
always straightforward. For example, the presence of impurities in the sample may 
mask the colour produced or even produce their own colour reactions.
 
Typically, colour tests will produce a positive result with about 1 mg of the analyte 
and are carried out in a test tube or on the surface of a white, glazed ceramic tile or 
via the use of commercially available ‘dipstick’ kits. Irrespective of the equipment 
and reagents used, a blank test and a positive control test may be carried out 
alongside the test of the sample. The blank test consists of the reagents only (i.e. 
with no sample present), while the positive control contains both the reagents and

a pure portion of the analyte that is being tested for. The appearance of these blank 
and positive control tests may then be compared with the colour produced by the 
sample under investigation and thereby aid the interpretation of this colour. The 
blank test also helps to confirm that contamination of the equipment used has not 
occurred and the positive control serves to prove that the reagents do indeed lead 
to colour production with the analyte of interest.
 
It is important to realise that presumptive tests cannot unequivocally identify 
the drug or other poison present in any sample. However, they provide valuable 
information that guides the analyst in the selection of further tests that will confirm 
or refute the indications provided by the presumptive tests. Table 7.5 lists some of 
the presumptive tests commonly employed in the analysis of drugs.
Thin-layer chromatography
Both bulk samples and samples that contain trace levels of drugs or other 
poisons may be analysed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC, Chapter 11, Box 
11.5). Often those reagents that are employed in colour tests may also be used 
to locate (i.e. visualise) the analyte(s) on TLC plates after development. TLC is

Note that barbiturates do not produce a colour change with any of the above tests. However, they do form a blue-violet colour 
when assayed using the Dillie–Koppanyi test (in which cobalt acetate in methanol that has been acidified with acetic acid is 
first added to the substance under test, followed by isopropylamine in methanol). Also, benzodiazepines produce a pink or red-
purple colour when exposed to the Zimmerman test (in which 2,4-dinitrobenzine in methanol is first added to the substance 
under test, followed by potassium hydroxide in water).

 
 242  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
a separative technique and one that provides numerical data about the chemical 
species present in a sample (in the form of Rf values). Furthermore, in many 
cases, different compounds appear as different-coloured spots after they have 
been visualised. For these reasons, TLC is often more able to discriminate between 
different analytes than are colour tests. For example, as indicated in Table 7.5, 
both amphetamine and methamphetamine produce an orange reaction when 
assayed using the Marquis test. These compounds can be readily differentiated, 
however, by TLC. This may be done by dissolving the solid in methanol, spotting 
it onto a silica gel TLC plate together with both positive and negative control 
samples and developing the plate using a 25/6/0.4 by volume mixture of 
methanol, propanone and ammonia. The spots on the plate can then be visualised 
by a number of techniques. These include spraying with dilute (0.5 m) sodium 
hydroxide, allowing the plate to dry and then spraying with an aqueous solution 
of Fast Black K (0.5% wt/vol). Where present, the amphetamine spot will appear 
purple, while the methamphetamine will be rendered orange or red. Furthermore, 
the Rf values of these two compounds will be quite different (0.62 for amphetamine 
and 0.26 for methamphetamine; Figure 7.9).
 
It should be noted, however, that although TLC can refine the indications 
provided by presumptive tests, confirmatory tests (such as gas chromatography–
mass spectrometry, GC–MS, Chapter 11, Box 11.5) will usually have to be performed 
before the identity of the analyte can be unequivocally determined.

THE ANALYSIS OF DRUGS AND OTHER POISONS  243
Immunoassay
Immunoassay techniques (Box 7.4) are of significant value in the analysis of both 
trace and bulk samples for drugs and other poisons. In some cases, it is possible to 
devise immunoassays that are highly specific, thereby allowing the concentration of 
an individual compound to be established – even in a complex mixture. For example, a 
highly specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay has been devised to analyse plasma for 
the herbicide paraquat. This is capable of quantifying this poison even when chemically 
related herbicides are also present in the sample. Also, immunoassays can be devised 
that are deliberately intended to detect the presence of a range of chemically related 
compounds. Thus, for example, immunoassay techniques have been developed that 
allow the detection of any one of several barbiturates and their metabolites.
In a forensic context, immunoassays are widely used in 
the analysis of body fluids (such as urine and blood) for 
the presence of drugs and other poisons, in both ante-
mortem and post-mortem samples. Such techniques 
may be highly specific, that is tailored to recognise 
an individual compound (e.g. methamphetamine), or 
may be designed to react with a group of chemically 
related compounds. In the latter case, a positive result 
requires confirmation of the identity of the analyte by 
the application of another suitable analytical technique, 
such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). 
Immunoassay techniques have a number of advantages: 
they are highly sensitive, well suited to the analysis of 
high numbers of samples (an obvious advantage when 
screening for banned substances in body fluids) and do 
not require a preliminary extraction stage. 
 
Immunoassay is based on the antibody–antigen 
reaction. This is a natural process that occurs within 
the mammalian immune system. A specific antibody 
is produced by the immune system in response to the 
introduction of a specific ‘foreign substance’ (termed the 
antigen) into the body of the mammal concerned. The 
antibody selectively binds with the antigen to form an 
antigen–antibody complex. This natural phenomenon is 
exploited in immunoassays. In these techniques, specific 
antibodies are used to detect (and, often, quantify) the 
analyte of interest. The analyte, which, in this context, 
is a drug or another poison, acts as the antigen to the 
antibody used in the test. Note that for the purposes of 
this box, the term poison is used to denote both drugs 
and other poisons.
 
In immunoassays used to test for poisons, fixed 
quantities of both the antibody specific for the analyte 
being tested for and a labelled form of that substance 
are added to the sample under test. Both the labelled 
molecules and, if present, the unlabelled analyte 
molecules in the test sample competitively bind with the 
antibody in numbers that are inversely proportional to 
each other. Thus, measuring the labelled poison (either 
bound to the antibody or free in the solution) can give 
information concerning the original concentration of the 
unlabelled poison in the sample.
 
In some types of immunoassay, it is not possible 
to distinguish between the labelled poison bound 
to the antibody and that remaining free in solution. 
Consequently, physical separation of the two phases is 
required before measurement. Immunoassays that require 
such separation are known as heterogeneous immuno-
assays. Examples include radioimmunoassay. In other 
systems, the bound, labelled poison can be discerned 
from that which is free in solution and, therefore, no 
separation stage is needed. Immunoassays that do not 
require a separation stage are termed homogeneous 
immunoassays. An example of this type is fluorescence 
polarisation immunoassay (FPIA).

One of the great benefits of immunoassay techniques is that, because of their high 
specificity and sensitivity, they can be used to analyse for trace levels of substances 
in complex matrices. Therefore, unlike many chromatographic methods, they do 
not have an inherent need for a prior extraction stage. Immunoassay techniques are 
particularly well suited to the analysis of samples in high numbers. They are used 
to screen samples of body fluids for the presence of banned substances, followed by 
confirmatory analysis by GC–MS (Chapter 11, Box 11.5) of any positive findings.
Instrumental methods
While presumptive tests and TLC are valuable in indicating the likely nature of any 
drug or other poison present in a sample, definitive analysis is normally carried out 
by instrumental means. The techniques chosen will depend on a number of factors 
including the nature of the analyte and its matrix, the concentration of the analyte 
and the amount of sample available.
 
For organic analytes at trace levels, the most commonly used methods are based 
on either gas chromatography (GC) or high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) (Chapter 11, Box 11.5). These techniques have the advantage that they 
separate the analyte from the mixture it is held in while simultaneously providing 
both qualitative and quantitative information about it. In many instances, the GC 
or HPLC is linked to another instrument, such as a mass spectrometer (MS), to 
produce so-called hyphenated techniques (Chapter 11, Box 11.5).
 
In some cases, quantification is conveniently achieved using ultraviolet–visible 
spectrophotometric methods (Chapter 3, Box 3.6). These work well in cases in 
which the analyte is the only chemical species present that absorbs light in the 
ultraviolet–visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Unfortunately, complex 
 
There are a number of different methods of immuno-
assay used in the analysis of poisons. These vary in 
the nature of the substances used to label the poison 
molecules and, consequently, the methods employed 
to make the required measurements. Two of the main 
methods are described briefly below.
Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
In this type of immunoassay, the poison molecules 
are labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, such as 
iodine-125 (125I) or tritium (3H), and measurements are 
of radioactivity. RIA is a heterogeneous immunoassay 
and thus the two phases containing the radiolabelled 
poison (i.e. bound to the antibody and free in solution) 
require separation before measurements can be made. 
The concentration of unlabelled poison molecules in 
the test mixture may be determined by reference to 
a standard curve. This graph is produced by adding 
increasing concentrations of the unlabelled poison to a 
fixed quantity of radiolabelled poison and the antibody 
specific to the poison concerned. The percentage of 
radiolabelled poison bound to the antibody is then 
plotted against the concentration of unlabelled poison.
Fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA)
In this type of immunoassay, a suitable fluorescent 
substance (such as fluorescein, an organic dye) is 
used to label the poison concerned. It is possible to 
distinguish between the fluorescence-labelled poison 
bound to the antibody and the fluorescence-labelled 
poison free in solution. This is because the former 
produces polarized fluorescence while the latter 
generates unpolarized fluorescence. FPIA is therefore 
an example of homogeneous immunoassay. 
Box 7.4  continued

 
THE ANALYSIS OF DRUGS AND OTHER POISONS  245
mixtures of such species will usually have to be separated, to produce materials of 
greater purity, prior to quantification by such methods. This disadvantage limits 
their use in the analysis of drugs and other poisons, which are frequently present 
in combination with many other species. Note, however, that detectors that rely on 
the absorbance of light in the ultraviolet–visible region are routinely used in the 
analysis of drugs and other poisons by HPLC (Chapter 11, Box 11.5). This is possible 
because the separation of the sample into its component parts that is afforded by 
the chromatographic column means that, in many cases, only one light-absorbing 
species is present in the detector at any one time.
 
As described in Chapter 3, Box 3.10, virtually all molecules absorb electromagnetic 
radiation in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum to produce a series 
of peaks (seen as troughs in the transmittance spectrum), the positions and number 
of which are characteristic of the molecule concerned. Therefore, by comparing the 
positions of the peaks in the infrared spectra of an unknown compound with those 
of known compounds until a match is found, the likely identity of the unknown can 
be established (Figure 7.10). Hence, infrared spectroscopy can provide valuable 
qualitative information about pure compounds. Unfortunately, most samples that 
are analysed for the presence of drugs and other poisons are complex mixtures,

thereby limiting the applicability of this technique. However, relatively recently, 
affordable infrared microscopes (Figure 7.11) have been developed. These are 
capable of obtaining this type of qualitative information from the individual particles 
of powders that are made up of physical mixtures of two or more pure compounds.
 
There are a number of methods that can be used to identify and quantify 
metallic poisons. Notable among these are atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) 
and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)(see Box 
7.5). These are capable of analysing liquids, giving both qualitative and quantitative 
information about the elements they contain with great selectivity, high sensitivity 
and low limits of detection. This means that they can be used to analyse body fluids 
with the minimum of sample pre-treatment. Solid samples can also be analysed. 
However, this is normally done after they have been chemically treated to bring 
their component elements into solution.
Factors influencing the choice of analytical methods
The methods used to analyse a given sample will vary depending on a number of 
factors. Important among these is how much is already known about the sample. 
For example, consider a case in which it is believed that a person died as the 
result of ingesting the herbicide paraquat. In such an instance, the purpose of a 
toxicological analysis may be to establish whether there was a lethal concentration 
of this substance in the plasma of a blood sample taken from the deceased during 
post-mortem examination. Such an analysis would be conducted using a proven 
method that will allow the quantification of this substance within plasma. A number 
of such methods exist, including the highly specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay 
mentioned earlier in this section (Box 7.4). Owing to the specificity of this method, 
it could not be expected to reveal the presence of poisons other than paraquat. 
Hence, while it may well be fit for this application, it would not be particularly useful 
in a case in which the presence of a wide range of poisons needs to be tested for.

THE ANALYSIS OF DRUGS AND OTHER POISONS  247
As explained in Chapter 3, Box 3.6, an atom, ion or 
molecule can absorb light in the ultraviolet–visible 
region of the electromagnetic spectrum, resulting in the 
promotion of an electron from the orbital in which it is 
residing to one of higher energy that is either empty or 
partially full. In order for this absorption to occur, the 
difference between the energy state of the atom, ion or 
molecule concerned at the start of the process (E) and 
at the end (E', which is of higher energy than E) must 
satisfy Bohr’s frequency condition, that is:
E' – E = DE = hν; in a vacuum this equals hc
––l
where h is Planck’s constant and ν is the frequency of the 
incident radiation.
 
Note that in a vacuum, DE also equals hc/l, in 
which c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and l is the 
wavelength of the incident radiation.
 
As described in Box 3.6, the ultraviolet–visible 
absorption spectra of molecules each typically consists 
of one or more broad bands of elevated absorbance. 
As exemplified by the spectrum of aqueous cocaine 
hydrochloride, shown in Box 3.6, each such band 
typically extends over a range of wavelengths that is 
tens of nanometres (nm) wide. In contrast, gaseous 
atoms have ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra that 
consist of very narrow peaks (known as lines), which 
extend over a wavelength range in the region of 0.002 
to 0.005 nm wide. Atomic absorption spectroscopy 
(AAS) takes advantage of this phenomenon to allow the 
concentration of each of a large number of the elements 
to be determined, even in complex mixtures.
 
In common with other types of absorption 
spectrometers, AAS machines contain a radiation source 
and a radiation detector, between which are a sample 
holder and wavelength selector. The last of these 
components is used to select and restrict the range of 
wavelengths that reach the detector at any one time. 
However, in the case of AAS, the radiation source and 
sample holder are somewhat specialised.
 
Let us consider the sample holder first. In order to 
observe the line absorption spectra exhibited by atoms, 
the sample must be atomised. This means it must be 
broken into its constituent atoms so that each is in a 
chemically isolated environment in the gas phase. For 
most elements of forensic interest (e.g. toxic metals 
such as lead and cadmium), atomisation can only be 
achieved at high temperatures. The most convenient 
way of achieving these temperatures is in a flame. In 
flame AAS (FAAS), the sample in the form of a solution 
is sprayed into a stream of a flammable mixture of fuel 
and oxidant gases that is burnt to produce a flame that 
acts as the sample holder. As an alternative to a flame, 
a small graphite furnace can be used as a sample 
holder. This is made to heat up rapidly to a high 
temperature by passing an electric current through it, 
thereby atomising the sample.
 
Irrespective of the means by which the analyte is 
atomised, the radiation source used makes use of the 
fact that Bohr’s frequency condition also applies to 
atoms emitting radiation. Consider an atom in an excited 
state E' that relaxes to a lower energy state E by the 
emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency of 
the emitted radiation will accord with Bohr’s frequency 
condition, namely E' – E = hν, which, in a vacuum equals 
hc/l. Therefore, an atom of an element that has relaxed 
from E' to E by emitting electromagnetic radiation will 
have produced radiation with exactly the right frequency 
to promote another atom of the same element from E to 
E'. The radiation source used in AAS is therefore a cloud 
of excited atoms of the element that is to be analysed 
for. If the intensity of the radiation produced by this 
cloud were to be plotted as a function of wavelength, it 
would be seen to consist of a series of extremely sharp 
peaks (called lines) that have identical wavelengths 
to the lines in the absorption spectrum of the element 
concerned. Furthermore, the exact wavelengths at which 
these lines occur are unique to a given element. It is 
for this reason that AAS is capable of analysing for one 
element, even in mixtures that contain many elements. 
 
In most cases, the cloud of excited atoms is formed 
in a hollow-cathode lamp. This consists of a sealed glass 
tube that has a Pyrex or quartz window at one end.

Also of importance is the amount of material that is available. In the case of a 
bulk sample, there may well be enough material to conduct presumptive tests, TLC 
and instrumental methods. In contrast, it would not be possible to carry out all of 
this work on a small sample that is believed to contain trace levels of the analyte. In 
such instances, a judgement would have to be made, based on the circumstances of 
This tube is filled with an inert gas, such as argon, at 
a low pressure and contains two electrodes – an anode 
and a cathode. The surface of the cathode is made of 
the element that is to be analysed for. A direct current 
potential difference of several hundred volts is applied 
across the electrodes. This ionises the inert gas, 
producing electrons that move towards the anode and 
positively charged ions that move to the cathode. These 
ions strike the cathode with sufficient force to knock 
atoms from its surface. This cloud of atoms contains 
some that are in excited states and acts as the source of 
radiation for the instrument.
 
Excited atoms are also produced in high-temperature 
gases. As in a hollow-cathode lamp, these atoms can 
relax by emitting radiation that is characteristic of the 
elements involved. This phenomenon is exploited in 
atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) to identify and/or 
measure the concentration of a wide range of elements 
that might be present in a sample. To do this, the 
sample is heated to a very high temperature and the 
radiation that is emitted is passed through a wavelength 
selector and into a radiation detector. The high 
temperatures required are generated in either a flame or  
high-temperature plasma. In this context, a plasma is 
a gas that contains a high concentration of ions and 
electrons. During inductively coupled plasma atomic 
emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES, often known simply as 
ICP), the plasma is maintained in a flow of argon. To 
start the plasma, an electric spark is passed through the 
argon. This causes enough of the argon to lose electrons 
and become ions for the gas to interact with a fluctuating 
magnetic field. This is provided by an induction coil that 
is wrapped around the gas stream. The coil is supplied by 
a radiofrequency generator that is sufficiently powerful 
to heat the gas and generate the plasma.
 
The quantification of specific elements within 
a sample may be achieved by either AAS or AES by 
establishing a calibration graph. In most instances, this 
is achieved by passing a series of solutions of known 
analyte concentration through the instrument in turn. In 
each case, the instrument response is noted. A graph is 
then plotted with the concentration of the analyte on 
the x-axis and the instrument response on the y-axis. 
Quantification is now possible by passing the solution of 
unknown analyte concentration through the instrument 
and noting its response. As shown in the figure above, 
interpolation will now allow the concentration of the 
unknown to be established.
 
The great advantages of both AAS and AES are their 
element specificity (meaning that complex mixtures can 
be analysed without the need to separate them first), their 
high sensitivity and low limits of detection. However, they 
do require the destruction of the portion of the sample 
that is analysed and they give no direct information about 
the chemical form of the analyte element(s) present.

the case, about which method(s) to use. Compared with presumptive tests and TLC, 
many instrumental methods of analysis (notably those based on GC, HPLC, AAS and 
ICP) provide high levels of sensitivity and selectivity with low limits of detection and 
yield reliable qualitative and quantitative results. Consequently, when trace samples 
are all that are available, such instrumental methods will be the ones of choice.
The optimisation of both the analyte’s concentration and  
the chemical form of the sample
Most samples that are analysed for the presence of drugs or other poisons are 
complex mixtures. Furthermore, in many cases, the concentration of analyte within 
the sample is low – this is especially true of samples of biological materials taken 
from people, whether ante-mortem or post-mortem. These two factors mean that 
most samples cannot be analysed without some form of pre-treatment. The purpose 
of such pre-treatment is to:
 simplify the matrix within which the analyte is held in order to remove 
substances that will interfere with the signal produced by the analyte when it 
is analysed;
 concentrate (or, rarely, dilute) the analyte so that it is present at a 
concentration that is within the working range of the instrument to be used 
to analyse for it; and/or
 alter the physical state or chemical form of the sample to make it compatible 
with the analytical technique to be employed (e.g. most techniques 
require samples in solution form, while GC furthermore requires volatile 
and thermally stable analytes; therefore, prior to GC analysis, chemical 
derivatisation is sometimes needed).
Naturally, the form and extent of the pre-treatment will depend on the nature of:
 the sample (especially its physical form – solid, liquid or, rarely, gas, its 
purity and the likely concentration range of the analyte within it);
 the analyte (especially important is whether the analyte is a molecule or an 
element);
 the analytical technique that is to be employed after the sample 
pre-treatment has been completed.
In the main, pre-treatment methods that are employed when the analyte is a 
molecule must be less destructive than when it is an element.
 
In many cases in which biological samples are being analysed for trace levels 
of molecular analytes, the pre-treatment centres around the extraction and 
concentration of the analyte. Prior to this, additional pre-treatment may be 
required. This may involve, for example, removing part of the sample by physical 
means (e.g. filtration or centrifugation), changing the physical form of the sample 
(e.g. the maceration of tissue) or adjusting the sample’s level of acidity. After 
this stage, the sample is usually present as a water-based solution or slurry and is 
ready for extraction. During extraction, the sample is brought into contact with a 
material that has an affinity for the analyte but that will not mix with the sample as 

 
 250  FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY AND DRUGS OF ABUSE
a whole. Materials used for this purpose are commonly organic solvents which are 
not miscible with water but which will dissolve the analyte. Mixing the sample with 
the solvent will therefore result in the transfer of the analyte to the solvent. If the 
resulting mixture is left to stand or centrifuged, the organic and aqueous phases 
will usually separate, thereby allowing the analyst to remove the organic phase, 
which now contains the analyte. If the solvent has a higher affinity for the analyte 
than does water, and if the volume of the organic solvent is sufficiently lower than 
that of the aqueous phase, the concentration of the analyte will be increased by 
extraction. Note that in order to maximise the efficiency of extraction, the same 
aqueous-phase sample may be mixed sequentially with multiple batches of organic 
solvent. These batches will then be combined. Irrespective of the number of batches 
of organic solvent used, the analyte’s concentration can subsequently be increased 
by reducing the volume of the solvent by evaporation. The extraction stage not only 
pre-concentrates the analyte but, importantly, also isolates it from many of the 
impurities present in the original sample.
 
Note that many drugs and other poisons are either weak acids (e.g. phenobarbitone) 
or weak bases (e.g. cocaine). Both ionised and un-ionised forms of these substances 
exist. The organic solvents that are used to extract these from aqueous solution have 
a much higher affinity for them when they are un-ionised than when they are ionised. 
In order to suppress the formation of the ionic form in the aqueous phase, and thereby 
promote extraction, the level of acidity of the solution is manipulated by the addition 
of an acid (e.g. hydrochloric acid) or a base (e.g. ammonia), as appropriate. Weak 
acids are extracted from suitably acidic aqueous solutions, in which they are in the 
un-ionised form. In contrast, weak bases are un-ionised when in suitably alkaline 
aqueous solutions and it is from these that such substances are extracted.
 
Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is an alternative to the liquid–liquid extraction 
outlined above. During SPE, a liquid sample is passed through a bed of finely 
divided solid adsorbent that is designed to selectively remove the analyte of interest 
from solution in the sample. The adsorbent may then be washed to purify the 
analyte further. Finally, the analyte is desorbed with a small volume of a suitable 
solvent. This process can both isolate the analyte from impurities and increase its 
concentration.
 
In the main, samples that are to be analysed for metals or other elements are 
treated somewhat differently. This reflects the fact that while it is necessary to 
present the analyte in a form that is suitable for the technique to be used in the 
ultimate analysis, it is not normally necessary for the analyte to retain its original 
chemical form. For example, the analysis of a food sample for a heavy metal poison 
may be attempted by AAS. To achieve this, the food may first be heated in a furnace 
until it turns to ash. This will simultaneously concentrate the metal (provided that 
it does not vaporise during ashing) and may alter its chemical form to make it 
readily soluble in a suitable acid. The metal can then be extracted into the acid and 
analysed by AAS (Box 7.5).
 
Finally, it is important to note that, in all cases, the analyst should keep the 
number of pre-treatment steps to the minimum. This is because each such step either 
decreases the total amount of analyte present and/or introduces new materials to 
the sample, thereby increasing the possibility of sample contamination. Also, each 
additional step adds to the time and cost of the overall procedure and may expose the 
analyst to unnecessary risk due to the additional use of hazardous chemicals, etc.

A poison may be defined as any substance that exerts a 
toxic effect when it encounters a biological system. In this 
chapter, the following broad groups of poisons are described: 
anions, corrosive poisons, gaseous and volatile poisons, 
metal and metalloid poisons, pesticides, toxins and drugs 
of abuse. Any exposure of an individual to potentially toxic 
substances may be accidental or the result of a deliberate 
act of, for example, attempted suicide or murder.
 In addition, many substances are deliberately self-
administered for the effects they induce. These are known 
collectively as drugs of abuse and are generally considered 
separately from other groups of poisons as a special case. 
The vast majority of these are subject to the Misuse of Drugs 
Act 1971 and therefore may also be referred to as controlled 
drugs. Such drugs may be produced illegally and/or diverted 
from licit sources. Examples include amphetamines, 
benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, heroin and lysergic acid 
diethylamide (LSD). However, some abused drugs, such as 
alcohol, are available legally. 
 The toxicity of a potentially poisonous sustance is 
determined by the dose that is administered, although 
other factors related to the recipient, such as weight, 
age, state of health and previous exposure, are also 
important. Poisons may be taken into the body via a 
number of different routes, namely ingestion, inhalation, 
skin contact, mucous membrane contact and injection. 
After absorption into the general blood circulation and 
subsequent distribution around the body, toxic substances 
are then eliminated from the body. Understanding the 
nature and dynamics of these processes is fundamental to

may help the courts to establish whether an offence has 
been committed, the nature of that offence and whether 
the accused is guilty. It can also provide intelligence 
information by linking different samples to the same source. 
The analytical procedures used will normally include the 
recording of readily made observations (e.g. shape, colour 
and dimensions) and will often employ presumptive tests,

Introduction
The term ‘questioned document’ is a wide-ranging term applicable to any document 
over which there is some dispute or query and to which the skills of a document 
examiner may be brought as part of the investigative process. Document examin-
ation is a very important and highly skilled area of forensic science, requiring 
thorough training of its practitioners and access to suitably equipped laboratories. 
In the UK, at the time of writing (March 2011), there are forensic document 
examiners in both the public sector, notably the Forensic Science Service, and the 
private sector, for example Document Evidence Ltd of Birmingham and London.
 
Examples of questioned documents include disputed wills, forged cheques, 
altered receipts, ransom notes and anonymous letters. To give a clearer idea of the

variety of work encompassed within this specialist area, some examples of the types 
of questions that may be put to forensic document examiners are listed in Box 8.1. 
 
In this chapter, the key aspects of the analysis of questioned documents, 
including handwriting and signature investigation, the examination of typed, word-
processed and photocopied documents, printed documents and counterfeiting, 
and ink and paper analysis, are systematically examined. Throughout the chapter, 
emphasis is placed on the techniques employed by forensic document examiners to 
reveal information contained within questioned documents.
8.1 Handwriting investigation
Generally, the largest part of the work undertaken by forensic document examiners 
is connected with the analysis of handwriting. Fundamental to this analysis is the 
principle that the writing of each person is unique to him or her. Further, that each 
piece of writing from a given individual is in itself unique, but that the writings of 
that individual vary over a natural range, which is another feature of that person’s 
writing. As a consequence, handwriting can be used as a means of individual 
identification, provided that sufficient quantities of specimen material (preferably 
non-request) are available for comparison with the questioned handwriting (Section 
8.1.2). It should be noted that the scientific analysis of handwriting undertaken by 
forensic document examiners is entirely different from the work of graphologists, 
who scrutinise the handwriting of individuals in an attempt to infer their personality 
traits. Confusion may arise because graphologists are also often referred to as 
handwriting experts.

 256  QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS
8.1.1  The development of handwriting
Handwriting is a complex motor task, which must be learnt. In the UK, this process 
usually begins when the child is about 4 years of age. In the early stages, the child 
consciously copies the different letters presented to him or her. As these are usually 
in a standard form, the handwriting of the child is similar at this stage to that of 
his or her classmates (and to that of other children taught using the same writing 
system). Such features in common are known as class characteristics. However, as 
the child increases in skill, the act of handwriting becomes less demanding and his 
or her construction, and other aspects (such as shape and proportion), of character 
forms become more individualised. Such distinctive features are known as individual 
characteristics, and taken in the context of class characteristics, it is these that are 
used by document examiners to identify handwriting. The main period during which 
these individual characteristics are developed is during the adolescent years. After 
this, the handwriting of a mature individual usually stays basically the same with 
only minor changes until the lack of pen control associated with advancing years 
causes it, once again, to alter significantly. 
8.1.2  The comparison of handwriting
A number of different basic types of handwriting are recognised. In the UK, these are 
designated as block capitals (i.e. upper-case unjoined writing), cursive writing (i.e. 
lower-case joined-up writing) and script (i.e. lower-case unjoined writing) (Figure 
8.1). Two other terms should be mentioned in this context, namely connected 
writing and disconnected writing. In the UK, forensic handwriting experts usually 
consider these terms to be synonymous with cursive writing and script respectively. 
 
In practice, the normal handwriting of most individuals is somewhere between 
cursive writing and script. In such cases, handwriting experts will normally use the 
term ‘cursive writing’ to denote handwriting in which the letters within words are 
predominantly joined and, conversely, use the term ‘script’ for handwriting in which 
the majority of the letters within words are not joined. Signatures are a specialised 
form of handwriting, which are examined separately in Section 8.2.

HANDWRITING INVESTIGATION  257
 
It is crucial that any comparison between questioned and specimen handwriting is 
carried out on a ‘like for like’ basis. This means that in order to make a meaningful 
comparison, the type of handwriting must be the same in each of the two samples. 
Furthermore, individual letters that are compared in the two samples must also be 
the same as each other. For example, the letter ‘b’ in one document written in cursive 
style must be compared with the letter ‘b’ written in cursive style in the other. Groups 
of letters and words that are compared in the two samples ideally will also be the 
same as each other. However, this is not always possible in cases where the specimen 
handwriting used in the comparison is of the non-request variety (the nature of non-
request specimens of handwriting is described later in this section). 
 
When analysing handwritten questioned documents, the forensic document 
examiner compares all characters present, deciding on the basis of his or 
her experience which are those handwriting traits that help make it uniquely 
identifiable. This examination is best carried out using a low-power stereoscopic 
microscope. Under magnification, the construction, proportions (both internal and 
relative to each other) and shape of the individual characters are clearly visible. 
In the case of the construction of characters, it is necessary to ascertain both the 
directions in which the constituent pen strokes have been made and the order in 
which they have been laid down. (The direction of pen movement can also reveal 
the difference between right- and left-handed individuals. For example, circular pen 
strokes, as seen in the letter ‘o’, made in an anticlockwise direction indicate right-
handedness whereas those made in a clockwise direction attest to left-handedness.) 
Other handwriting features such as the connections between letters (if any) and the 
slope of the writing may contribute to individualising the content, as can general 
writing features, such as word and letter spacing, and date style and arrangement. 
 
It is important to realise that the handwriting of an individual shows natural 
variation. This means that it is never exactly the same on any two occasions. When 
making a comparison with questioned handwriting, it is therefore necessary for the 
document examiner to have access to sufficient quantities of specimen handwriting 
in order to assess this natural variation and take it into account. The forensic 
document examiner is also aware that handwriting may show variation because of 
other factors. These may be associated with the mental and physical state of the 
writer, for example whether a person is ill, stressed or under the influence of alcohol 
or other drugs, or it may be caused by the writing surface or writing instrument 
used. In some cases, variation occurs because the writer is attempting to disguise 
his or her own natural handwriting.
 
The specimen handwriting required for comparison with questioned 
handwriting falls into one of two categories:
 Non-request specimens. This type of specimen is preferable as it consists of 
documents that the author, at the time of writing, had no notion would be used 
for the purpose of an inquiry. Ideally, such documents should originate, as near 
as possible, from the time at which the questioned document was written. 
 Request specimens. In this case, as the name suggests, the suspect is asked to 
produce handwriting samples especially for the purpose of the inquiry (Box 
8.2). This differs from non-request specimens in that the conditions under 
which this task is carried out can be more controlled. The same type of paper 
and pen can be provided and the individual may be requested to write out

exactly the same text as in the questioned document. However, this type of 
specimen material has its limitations. It will lack the natural variation that 
can be provided by non-request specimens, assuming that the latter type 
is available in sufficient quantities. Moreover, the suspect may attempt to 
disguise his or her handwriting or it may change as a result of stress, or other 
factors. Dictating the text and doing so repeatedly with breaks in between 
can help overcome the problem of disguised or unnatural handwriting.
In practice, it is best if both request and non-request handwriting specimens are 
available to the forensic document examiner. He or she uses the material to make 
a comparison between the specimen and questioned handwriting, systematically 
comparing characters (individually and in groups), physical features (such as the 
appearance of ink lines under a microscope) and general writing features (such as 
line position and punctuation). As a result of this process, the document examiner 
is able to make an assessment of the similarities and differences between the 
specimen and questioned handwriting. This necessitates considerable experience 
On 21 March 2000, Chris Cotter, the white former 
boyfriend of the black Olympic triple jumper Ashia 
Hansen, was attacked outside her home in Birmingham. 
In the assault, Mr Cotter was stabbed three times in the 
back and slashed across his forehead. He claimed that he 
had been set upon by a number of white men, possibly 
as many as five, who expressed their objections to his 
relationship with Ms Hansen. The police launched an 
extensive inquiry into this apparently racially motivated 
attack. Shortly afterwards, hate mail was received by 
Ms Hansen, and a number of other black international 
athletes including Dwain Chambers and Tony Jarrett.
 
On 19 May 2000, Chris Cotter himself was arrested, 
together with two friends, Craig Wynn and Surjit Singh 
Clair. All three were charged with conspiring to pervert 
the course of justice. At their trial at Birmingham 
Crown Court, an integral part of the prosecution’s case 
concerned the findings of a senior document examiner 
from the Forensic Science Service (FSS). He had compared 
the handwriting on the envelopes of the hate letters 
with request handwriting samples given by the three 
defendants at the time of their arrest. When asked by the 
court, he said, ‘The disguised nature of this handwriting 
was a severe limitation, but I could say that there was 
moderate evidence to support the view that Clair was the 
writer. In places, the disguise had lapsed and distinctive 
similarities with the specimen were found.’*
 
On 8 June 2001, all three defendants were found 
guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. 
Cotter and Wynn received prison sentences of 2 years 
each. However, Clair, who had entered negotiations 
with the Express newspaper to sell the story for several 
thousand pounds, was also found guilty of attempting 
to obtain property by deception and received an 
additional sentence of 12 months. The court was told 
that Cotter’s motivation in staging the attack upon 
himself was primarily concerned with winning back Ms 
Hansen’s affection, but that the prospect of financial 
gain from selling the story also played a part.

on the part of the document examiner, who must determine the significance of the

one of the following conclusions, each of which constitutes an expert opinion:
 There is conclusive evidence that the writer of the specimen and questioned

similarities and differences are of approximately similar significance) or 
there is very little evidence, for example a few letters in a name.

8.2 Signature investigation 
Signatures differ significantly from bulk handwriting in that they are highly stylised 
portions of writing – so much so that in some cases, they are completely illegible! 
They are used as a means of personal identification and, as such, are produced on 
numerous occasions, for signing cheques, letters, etc. This repeated usage means that 
their production becomes essentially automatic to the individual. However, because 
of natural variation, a person’s signature is never identical on two separate occasions.
 
Signatures are often the subject of fraudulent reproduction (i.e. forgery). 
Interestingly, in some instances, individuals may even try to give the impression that 
their own signatures have been forged on particular documents, with the express 
intention of later denying authorship. For example, in credit card transactions, an 
individual may use this ‘self-forgery’ when purchasing goods or services and then 
later claim that the card was stolen and his or her signature forged by another 
person. The aim of this deception is to avoid paying the credit card bill. In order 
to be successful, self-forged signatures must be similar enough to the individual’s 
normal signature to avoid arousing suspicion and yet be different enough so that 
claims of fraudulent use by another are subsequently upheld. 
8.2.1  Methods of signature forgery
In order to produce a credible signature forgery that will stand up to comparison 
with the genuine signature, the forger must have access to at least one example of 
an authentic signature. He or she may fraudulently reproduce this by either tracing 
or freehand simulation. 
Signature forgery
The fraudulent 
reproduction of the 
genuine signature of 
another individual.

 
 260  QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS
Tracing method
There are two methods of tracing a signature. In the trace-over method, the sheet of 
paper on which the forged signature is required is positioned below one bearing the 
genuine signature. The signature’s outline is then traced over and appears as a faint 
indentation on the sheet below. This impression is then inked in order to produce 
the forged signature. In the light box, or window, method, the document bearing 
the genuine signature is placed on a light box, or against a window, and the sheet 
of paper on which the forgery is to be written is positioned over it. Illuminated from 
behind, the target signature becomes sufficiently visible through the overlying sheet 
to be traced. This is usually done directly by pen but, in some cases, the signature is 
first traced by pencil and then inked. 
Freehand method
This forgery technique tends to produce a smoother and more fluent signature than 
can be achieved by using one of the tracing methods described above. The degree of 
success achieved will usually depend on the amount of practice undertaken by the 
forger in producing the desired signature and the level of skill he or she acquires.
8.2.2  The detection of forged signatures
In forging another’s signature, the forger attempts both to copy the genuine 
signature accurately and to maintain the fluency of the writing. In practice, 
however, these two aims tend to work in opposition to each other. If the writing 
is speeded up in order to improve its fluency, then accuracy will suffer as a result. 
Conversely, if the writing is slowed down in order to obtain greater accuracy, then 
some of the fluency will be lost. The result is necessarily a compromise between 
the two. Box 8.3 lists some of the characteristics that indicate to the document 
examiner that a signature, or longer piece of handwriting, may be forged.
 
The comparison of signatures has much in common with the comparison 
of handwriting (Section 8.1.2). In order to assess the range of natural variation, 
it is necessary for the document examiner to have access to sufficient specimen 
signatures to allow him or her to assess their natural variation. Often this is in the 
region of 6–12 signatures. Ideally, these should be non-request specimens that are, 
as far as possible, contemporaneous with the questioned signature. It should be 
noted that questioned signatures can be compared only with specimen signatures of 
the same name; it is not usually feasible to make comparisons between signatures 
of different names.
 
The document examiner makes an assessment of the similarities and 
differences between the two types of signatures – questioned and specimen – and 
their significance. The relatively small amount of information contained within 
a signature means that every aspect of it must be minutely examined. Based on 
this comparison, the document examiner may be able to state definitely whether 
a particular signature is genuine or forged, or it may only be possible to give a 
qualified conclusion (Section 8.1.2). It is not normally possible to identify who 
wrote a forged signature since the act of forgery necessarily involves the suppression 
of the forger’s natural handwriting.

 
SIGNATURE INVESTIGATION  261
There are a number of handwriting characteristics 
associated with forged signatures that will alert the 
experienced document examiner to the fact that they 
may not be genuine. A selection of these is given 
below (usually, more than one of the following signs 
are present): 
 ‘Shaky’ handwriting (apparent when viewed under 
magnification). This occurs when the forger 
concentrates on copying the genuine signature very 
accurately by writing slowly (thus resulting in a loss 
of fluency).
 Unnatural pen lifts. This shows that the forger has 
paused to check progress.
 Pen strokes with blunt ends where the pen has been 
lifted from the paper. This indicates that the pen 
strokes of the writer have been made slowly and 
deliberately, while in fluent writing, such pen stroke 
ends tend to be tapered. Low-power microscopy is 
needed to view this particular feature.
 Evidence of retouching. This indicates that the forger 
has attempted to patch up ‘less good’ parts of the 
signature in an effort to make it more realistic.
 Difference in scale. The writing is noticeably smaller 
or bigger than the genuine writing.
 Incorrect proportioning of the letters.
 Unnatural similarity between two (or more) 
signatures. (Such close correspondence between 
signatures would not occur if the signatures were 
genuine because of the range of natural variation 
shown in an individual’s normal handwriting.)
In addition to the handwriting characteristics listed 
above, there may be other features that differ from the 
victim’s normal practice, for example the positioning 
of the signature relative to the rest of the document. 
Moreover, there may be physical evidence present 
that has its origins in the type of forgery method 
used. For example, the trace-over method produces 
an impression of the signature, which is subsequently 
inked in (Section 8.2.1). However, it may be possible 
to detect minute areas of indentation that the pen has 
missed, by examining the questioned signature under 
an oblique light source (figure (a)).

8.3 Typed, word-processed and
  
 photocopied documents
The technology used to produce documents in the office environment, and indeed 
in the home, has changed dramatically over the last 50 years. From their advent at 
the end of the nineteenth century until the 1960s, manually operated typewriters 
were prevalent in the office workplace. However, during the 1960s and 1970s, 
electric typewriters progressively replaced the old-style manual typewriters. From 
the 1980s onwards, further advances were made with the progressive introduction 
of computer-based word-processor systems. This development in the production of 
original single documents has been paralleled by significant improvements in the 
technology used to produce copies of documents, to the photocopiers and facsimile 
(fax) machines commonly used today.
 
The evolution in the technological production and reproduction of documents 
within the office environment has necessitated a concomitant development in the 
expertise of forensic document examiners. The questions most frequently asked 
of them are likely to concern the type of machine used to produce a questioned 
document (and, if possible, its make and model) and whether a particular suspect 
machine was used to produce a specific questioned document or documents. 
8.3.1  Typed documents 
Although computer-based word-processor systems effectively dominate the modern 
workplace, typewriters are still used by a number of individuals. In the case of the 
serial killer Dr Harold Shipman, a typewriter was used by Shipman to fraudulently 
produce the will of one of his victims (Chapter 7, Box 7.2). The investigation of 
typed documents, therefore, still forms an important part of the document 
examiners’ repertoire. Typewriters, as mentioned previously, may be either manually 
or electrically operated.
 
Manual typewriters have fixed typebars, which means that the style of their 
typeface cannot be changed except by a typewriter mechanic. Their mode of 
operation involves the depression of character keys on the keyboard, which, in turn, 
causes the corresponding typebars to swing up and the typeface to strike on an 
inked ribbon, thus transferring an image of the typeface onto the paper beneath. 
In the light box method, in those cases where the genuine 
signature is traced first in pencil and then redone in ink, 
viewing the signature under infrared light can reveal the 
pencil marks underneath the ink (figure (b)).
 
Much of the information presented in this box is 
equally applicable to longer pieces of forged handwriting. 
However, it is worth noting that, in such instances, the 
act of forgery becomes harder with each additional word. 
This can be explained by the fact that the imitation of 
another’s writing style necessitates the suppression of 
the forger’s own natural handwriting. Inevitably, these 
suppressed characteristics begin to surface as the amount 
of writing increases, becoming ever more apparent in the 
forged material.
Box 8.3  continued

 
TYPED, WORD-PROCESSED AND PHOTOCOPIED DOCUMENTS  263
With continued use, manual typewriters become progressively more worn and 
damaged and this deterioration may become apparent in the appearance of the 
typed material. For example, individual characters:
 may appear out of alignment (i.e. they are too much to the right/left and/or 
too high/low);
 may not be uniformly inked;
 may show evidence of a damaged typeface; and/or
 may show evidence of a typeface that has accumulated dirt in a characteristic 
fashion.
Such defects, in combination, help to individualise a particular machine and may 
make it possible to identify it as the source of a particular typed document (or 
documents). They can also be used to show if two different typewritten documents 
were produced on the same machine. It should be noted that the evidential value of 
damage defects is greater than that of misalignments.
 
Single-element electric typewriters differ from manual typewriters in that their 
typeface is not fixed but carried on a single element that can easily be replaced. 
This element may be in the form of a ‘golfball’ (where the characters cover the 
surface of the ball and are made to strike the paper by the ball’s rotation) or a 
‘daisywheel’ (where the characters are carried individually at the end of spokes 
radiating from a central hub). Whatever the type, these single elements inevitably 
show signs of wear with increasing use and develop characteristic faults, which may 
help to make them uniquely identifiable. However, any such individualising features 
will be lost when the operator replaces the deteriorating element with a different 
one (although their transitory existence may still be useful in dating documents). 
As well as replacement for reasons of dilapidation, typing elements may also be 
interchanged when a different style of typeface is required.
Identification of the type of typewriter
Familiarity with the different typefaces used by typewriter manufacturers will 
assist the document examiner in identifying the make and, possibly, the model of 
the typewriter that has been used to produce a particular document. To this end, 
several classification systems based on differences in spacing and typeface are 
available, for example that constructed by Interpol (the International Criminal 
Police Organization). Such information will obviously be helpful in the search for a 
particular suspect machine. 
Comparison of typescripts
In order to investigate possible links between a questioned typewritten document and 
a specific typewriter, it is necessary to gather specimen typewriting for comparative 
purposes. Ideally, the forensic document examiner will have access to the suspect 
machine itself and use this to produce multiple specimen copies of the questioned 
typewriting. As well as being identical in content, copies should be as near as possible 
in appearance to that of the disputed document and take into account, for example, 

 
 264  QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS
the state of the ribbon used. In the absence of the suspect machine itself, similar 
material that has been typed on it in the past must be collected, ideally from around 
the time on which the questioned typewriting was produced.
 
In many instances, a careful side-by-side examination of the questioned and 
specimen typescript is sufficient to ascertain whether both were produced on the 
same machine. During this process, similarities and differences between individual 
characters, together with correspondence, or otherwise, between other distinctive 
features such as obvious misalignments are duly noted. However, sometimes, it 
is necessary to scrutinise the documents more closely before a conclusion can be 
reached. In these cases, specially designed grids, whose line spacing equates to the 
spacing used by typewriter manufacturers, can be useful in detecting less obvious 
misalignments in the placing of individual characters. 
 
As well as comparing the questioned and specimen typescript, the document 
examiner will also carefully examine the typewriter itself, and, in the case of single- 
element electric typewriters, any relevant typing elements, if these are available. 
Typewriting ribbons (both inked and correction types) associated with the suspect 
machine may also yield important evidential material and should be included in the 
investigation. 
8.3.2  Word-processed documents 
In the modern office environment, computer-based word-processor systems have 
almost totally eclipsed typewriters as the means of document production. In 
essence, keyboard operators use word-processor programs in order to compose 
documents, which are then usually stored electronically on computer file. These 
files may be printed out as and when required, using any of the several types of 
computer printers available on the market. Box 8.4 describes the three main types 
that are currently in common use.
 
In modern word-processor systems, the keyboard operator can easily change 
the font size, style and spacing of the typeface by selecting these parameters from 
a menu that is predetermined by the word-processing software. Importantly, the 
same software may be used on many word-processing computers. As a consequence, 
it is not possible, by the examination of any one document, to establish whether 
a particular computer was used to compose it. This is in marked contrast to the 
situation in which a typewritten document may be linked to the machine on which 
it was typed (Section 8.3.1).
 
It is also difficult to link a document with a specific computer printer beyond 
the level of its class characteristics. For example, in the case of ink-jet printers 
(described in Box 8.4), the printed text has a slightly blurred outline, which is 
characteristic of documents produced by this type of printer. However, identification 
beyond this level is much more challenging. In contrast, in laser printers (Box 8.4), 
it may be possible to link a particular document with a suspect printer, or show that 
two or more documents have been printed on the same machine, if there are faults 
present on the drum that are transferred to the printed page. In such cases, the 
appearance of more than one mark per page is usual and is due to the fact that the 
drum circumference is generally less than the length of an A4 piece of paper.

 
TYPED, WORD-PROCESSED AND PHOTOCOPIED DOCUMENTS  265
8.3.3  Photocopied documents 
In the past, photocopiers required paper of a special type but modern photocopiers 
use plain paper. Plain paper photocopiers are extensively used in the office workplace 
for the reproduction of documents, as well as being widely available to the general 
public, for example in shops (newsagents, post offices, etc.) and libraries. They 
operate on the same principle as the laser printer (described in Box 8.4), using 
light to facilitate the creation of an image of the original document. This image is 
formed using toner (a coloured, usually black, powder) that is fused to the surface 
of the paper, thereby making the copy. The forensic document examiner may be 
able to identify the model of photocopier used to produce a disputed document by 
the examination of certain features of the photocopy. Such features may include 
any characteristic marks caused by the mechanism used to handle the paper during 
copying, and the morphology and chemical composition of the toner used.
 
The document examiner may also be able to link a particular copy to a specific 
photocopier. As was the case with laser printers (Box 8.4), this may be facilitated 
by the appearance of regularly spaced marks on the photocopy that correspond to 
damage features present on the rotating drum. More transitory in nature, but often 
of great significance, are those marks appearing on the copy as specks or dots, 
Dot-matrix printers
This is the oldest type of printer. It incorporates 
a printer head that contains and controls a series 
of electromagnetically operated pins. Specific 
configurations of these pins correspond to individual 
printed characters. When the configured pins strike 
the paper through an inked fabric ribbon, they transfer 
a series of ink dots onto the paper to produce the 
desired character in printed form. 
Ink-jet printers
In ink-jet printers, ink is forced through a nozzle to 
form the printed characters. The exact mechanism 
by which the ink is delivered depends on the type of 
ink-jet printer used. Briefly, in ‘continuous stream’ 
printers, ink is delivered in a continuous stream 
and forms droplets that are subsequently charged. 
Those charged droplets needed to form the printed 
character are deflected towards the paper, while the 
remainder are ultimately returned to the ink reservoir. 
In contrast, ‘drop on demand’ printers have a grid of 
minute nozzles through which only those ink droplets 
needed to make up the printed character are forced.
Laser printers
Laser printers are capable of producing text characters of 
a consistently high standard. Their operation is based on 
the same principle as that used in photocopiers (Section 
8.3.3). They contain a photosensitive, positively charged, 
rotating drum. Acting on information received from the 
computer, a laser beam selectively discharges the drum 
so that a positively charged image of the document is 
left behind on its surface. The next stage involves the 
application of a negatively charged toner (i.e. a black or 
other coloured powder), which adheres to the positively 
charged document image. The toner is then transferred 
to a sheet of paper that is made to pass over the rotating 
drum. Finally, the toner is fused to the paper’s surface 
by the application of pressure or heat to produce the 
finished print.

either singly or collectively, often referred to as ‘trash marks’. These are caused 
by the presence of, for example, dust or dried correction fluid on the glass sheet 
on which the original document is placed for copying (known as the platen). As 
well as being important in identifying the machine used to reproduce a disputed 
document, trash marks can sometimes provide evidence to link together several 
photocopies and show that they have been produced using the same photocopier. 
8.4 Printed documents 
Mass-produced printed documents are an integral part of modern society. There 
are a wide variety of different types in common use, each fulfilling a particular 
function. Examples include banknotes, passports, chequebooks, vehicle registration 
documents, MOT test certificates and tax discs. Each of these types has an intrinsic 
value, for example as a means of personal identification, as proof of ownership, 
or in monetary terms. As a result, many types of printed documents are prone to 
fraudulent reproduction.

Screen printing
This printing method involves the use of a mesh screen 
made, for example, of silk or nylon, which is masked 
by a stencil. Ink is forced through the screen, thus 
transferring the stencilled design onto the surface of 
the material to be printed.
Letterpress 
In this method (also known as relief printing), the 
printing design stands proud of its background. Only 
this raised area is inked and, when this is brought 
into contact with the surface of the paper, the design 
is printed. This method is used extensively for the 
production of newsprint. 
Gravure 
In gravure (also known as intaglio), the image to be 
printed is incised into the surface of the printing plate. 
This engraved area consists of hundreds of tiny sunken 
cells. The entire printing plate is inked and then the 
surface ink scraped off by means of a metal blade. 
When the paper is pressed against the plate by roller, 
the ink left behind in the printing cells is transferred 
to the paper in the desired pattern. 
Lithography
Lithography has been practised for over 200 years 
and is currently the most widely used of the printing 
methods. In this method, the printing plate, which is 
usually composed of aluminium, is first treated with 
a greasy substance to form an image of the desired 
design. The plate then comes into contact with a 
roller that moistens the non-printing area of the plate, 
followed by contact with an inked roller. As the grease 
attracts the ink but the moisture repels it, ink is taken 
up only by the greased printing image. The plate next 
makes contact with a ‘blanket’ cylinder (composed of 
rubber) onto which the inked design is transferred 
(i.e. offset). The image on the blanket cylinder is then 
printed onto the paper. The term ‘offset lithography’ 
is sometimes more accurately used to describe this 
method of printing where there is no direct contact 
between printing plate and paper.

Traditional printing methods

 
PRINTED DOCUMENTS  267
 
The scrutiny of counterfeit documents is a routine part of the work of forensic 
document examiners. For this reason, it is necessary for practitioners to be familiar 
with the different methods used to produce printed documents. The four main types 
of traditional printing method are outlined in Box 8.5. All of these conventional 
methods involve the use of pressure to transfer ink to create the image on the 
paper. In contrast, modern computer printing technologies involve minimal or no 
contact. These are termed non-impact printing methods and include ink-jet and 
laser printing (Box 8.4).
On 1 January 2002, the euro currency (consisting of 
seven different banknotes and eight different coins) was 
introduced into 12 European countries. At a stroke, the 
individual currencies of these participating countries 
were replaced by a new currency. The sudden circulation 
of vast numbers of new banknotes and coins (14.5 billion 
and 50 billion respectively), together with a general 
public unused to handling the new currency, potentially 
provided an exceptional opportunity for counterfeiting, 
particularly with regard to the euro banknotes.
 
In order to minimise this risk, each euro note, printed 
on pure cotton paper, includes a combination of five 
different, easily visible security features within each 
banknote (see table). 
 
In addition to those features that are designed to be 
easily recognised by the general public, the euro notes 
incorporate further security devices designed to be 
detected by equipment routinely used by money-handling 
organisations such as banks and shops. Examples of 
these include fluorescent materials, observable under 
specialised lighting conditions, and microprint, which 
can be seen under magnification.

If a particular document is suspected of being counterfeit, a comparison with 
examples (preferably several) of the genuine article will help establish whether or not 
it is authentic. This comparison may involve the examination of a number of different 
aspects. These include the process used to produce the document (i.e. printing or 
photocopying), the presence, if any, of in-built security measures, the types of inks 
or toners used, and the properties of the paper. If a printed document is shown to be 
counterfeit, it may be possible, in some cases, to trace it back to those responsible. 
For example, trash marks present on a photocopied counterfeit document may be 
used to link it with a suspected photocopying machine (Section 8.3.3).
 
The quality of the printing of a counterfeit document, and therefore its potential 
to be passed off as genuine, will depend on the skill, experience and resources 
of the individual(s) involved. In order to combat the widespread threat posed by 
counterfeiting, most genuine printed documents include one or more inbuilt 
security features. Box 8.6 describes the anti-counterfeiting measures taken with 
respect to euro currency.
8.5 The analysis of handwriting inks
There are a number of different types of writing implement that may be used in 
the preparation of handwritten documents and with each of these is associated 
a particular kind of ink. Currently, the most popular type of pen is the ballpoint, 
which was introduced in the 1940s, and which has now largely replaced the more 
traditional fountain pen. Other modern types include felt-tipped, fibre-tipped and 
roller-ball pens. A visual examination of the writing on a document, using low-
powered microscopy, may provide general information on the type of ink, and 
therefore the type of writing instrument, used. For example, text written using 
ballpoint ink is readily identifiable, being thick and glossy in appearance, often with 
characteristic striation marks. These striations originate from incomplete inking of 
the ball that is used to transfer the ink to the page.
8.5.1  Comparison of inks
Beyond the broad identification of the type of writing implement used, analysis 
of the ink itself can yield valuable information about whether any alterations or 
additions have been made to the original document. Much of the work carried out 
by forensic document examiners in this area therefore involves a comparison of the 
inks found on a particular document to establish whether they are different. The 
discovery of more than one ink on a single document might suggest that it has been 
altered at some stage. 
 
The tests used for ink analysis fall into two broad categories: non-destructive and 
destructive. Non-destructive tests are used preferentially before destructive ones 
and mainly concern the examination of the inked text under different lighting 
conditions (Figure 8.2). Furthermore, infrared and Raman microscopes have now 
been developed that make it possible to obtain both infrared and Raman spectra 
of inks in situ on documents. The theoretical basis of each of these non-destructive 
techniques is described in Chapter 3, Box 3.10.

If the application of various non-destructive techniques is unsuccessful in 
detecting the presence of different inks on a disputed document, then the next 
step is to apply the so-called destructive tests. The term ‘destructive’ is, in fact, 
somewhat misleading in this context as these types of test necessitate the removal 
of only minute amounts of ink. Nonetheless, it is advisable to make a permanent 
record of a questioned document at this stage, either by taking a photograph or 
photocopying, before any destructive tests are carried out. Once samples have 
been taken, the usual means of discriminating between them is to separate their 
constituent dye components using chromatography, and then to compare the 
results (Figure 8.3). There are two chromatographic methods that are suitable 
for ink samples – high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer 
chromatography (TLC) – and, of these, the latter is more frequently employed. 
These techniques are described in Chapter 11, Box 11.5.
8.5.2  Dating of inks
Although techniques for the comparison of inks are relatively well developed, there 
are, as yet, no reliable methods for accurately ageing the inks used on documents. 
However, in some cases, a piece of written text may be exposed as fraudulent, if, 
for example, it can be demonstrated that the ink used only became commercially 
available after the date on which the document purports to have been written. 
In the United States, the US Treasury Department (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms) has built up an extensive, and apparently unique, reference library 
of commercial ink formulations, using thin-layer chromatograms to facilitate 
the dating of inks. Moreover, this department has also been instrumental in 
encouraging a number of US manufacturers to chemically ‘tag’ their inks on an 
annual basis, in order to pinpoint their year of manufacture. 
8.6 Paper analysis
Currently, the majority of documents are produced on paper and, consequently, 
paper analysis forms an important part of the work undertaken by forensic 
document examiners. Although much talked about, the ‘paperless office’, where 
most, or all, information is stored and communicated electronically, has become a 
reality only in a few specialist areas. The use of paper still represents the preferred 
option for many types of documentation. 
8.6.1  Comparison of paper 
Much of the work undertaken by forensic document examiners skilled in paper 
analysis involves a comparison of the characteristics of two (or more) pieces of 
paper to ascertain whether or not they may have a common origin. Essentially, the 
properties of paper are determined by what happens during the various stages of the 
manufacturing process (Box 8.7). This process involves many variables, such as the 
type of raw fibres used, the choice of sizing agent and the decision whether or not 
to bleach the fibres. The paper manufacturer can alter these variables to optimise

PAPER ANALYSIS  271
the efficiency of the production process, while producing paper of the desired type 
and quality.
 
The forensic document examiner makes use of these properties when searching 
for similarities and differences between two (or more) pieces of paper. There are 
basically two categories of tests available, namely non-destructive and destructive. 
Non-destructive tests are applied first, as these do not entail any damage to the 
documents. Such tests usually involve a visual comparison of features, such as the 
colour, size and shape of the sheets of paper, while thickness may be measured 
using a micrometer. Another non-destructive test that may be applied in this regard 
is a comparison of the fluorescent properties of the pieces of paper when viewed 
under ultraviolet (UV) light.
 
If it is deemed necessary to proceed further with the comparison, then there are a 
number of destructive tests that can be applied. However, it should be noted that the 
amount of paper required for such tests is very small and therefore the damage to the 
document limited. Destructive tests can yield information on a number of different 
properties of the paper, which can be used for comparative purposes, including:
 the types of raw fibre used (established by microscopic examination);
 the type of pre-treatment used to prepare the pulp, whether chemical or 
mechanical;
 the nature of the surface coating (established by X-ray powder diffraction, 
see Chapter 3, Box 3.11).
Paper is composed primarily of cellulose – a 
polysaccharide that forms the main structural material 
in plant cell walls. In general terms, paper quality is 
positively correlated with the percentage of cellulose 
that it contains. Paper can be made from almost any 
type of fibrous material. For example, cotton, linen, 
hemp and sisal are all sources of cellulose that may be 
utilised by the paper manufacturing industry. However, 
the most commonly used material is wood, usually from 
coniferous trees.
 
Prior to their use in paper manufacture, the 
fibres, whatever their origin, must be treated, either 
mechanically and/or chemically, to form pulp. The 
pulped fibres are then combined with copious amounts 
of water. At this stage, the pulp is usually bleached 
and other materials, such as whiteners, dyes and 
kaolin (china clay), may be added, depending on the 
properties desired in the finished product. A suitable 
sizing agent (e.g. starch or gelatin) is added to help 
bind the fibres together. 
 
In the next stage, the prepared mixture is 
introduced onto a moving frame which retains the 
fibrous material while allowing most of the water 
to escape. The resultant fibrous mat is pressed to 
remove yet more water and finally dried. During these 
final stages of treatment, a watermark – a patterned 
area containing fewer fibres per unit area – may be 
introduced into the paper by a raised design present 
on a special type of roller known as the ‘dandy roll’. In 
some cases, the final product is given a special coating 
if, for example, a glossy finish is required.

8.6.2  Dating of paper
Another important aspect of paper analysis is the dating of paper as this may 
yield valuable information about the authenticity of disputed documents. In this 
respect, the watermarks used by paper manufacturers are particularly useful. 
Watermarks contain fewer fibres per unit area than the rest of the sheet of paper 
and, as such, are usually visible when the paper is held up to the light (Figure 8.4). 
If the watermark is obscured by text or other marks, various techniques can be 
employed to reproduce a clearer image of the design. For example, sandwiching 
the questioned document between a radioactive source and a sheet of photographic 
paper may clearly reveal the pattern of the watermark on the photographic paper 
once it has been developed. 
 
The design of a watermark can be used to identify the paper manufacturer 
responsible. Furthermore, if the design used by a particular manufacturer has

In this classic case of publishing fraud, the Hitler diaries 
were eventually exposed as forgeries through an examin-
ation of the types of materials used to produce them. 
However, this revelation did not occur until after the 
diaries had been accepted, on the basis of handwriting 
examination, as the genuine diaries of Adolf Hitler.
 
In February 1981, a set of three, black-bound diaries, 
purportedly handwritten by Adolf Hitler, were brought to 
the attention of the German publishing company Grüner 
and Jahr by Gerd Heidemann, a journalist on its news 
magazine Stern. The source of the diaries, according to 
Heidemann, was a collector of Nazi memorabilia. On the 
basis of this sample, the publishing company agreed 
to purchase 27 volumes of the Hitler diaries and also a 
previously unknown third volume of his autobiography, 
Mein Kampf, for just under 2.5 million German marks.
 
Three separate document examiners made comparisons 
between the handwriting in the diaries and specimen 
samples of what was believed to be Hitler’s handwriting. 
As a result of their independent examinations, they each 
concluded that the diaries and the handwriting samples 
had been written by the same person. On the basis of 
these results, the diaries were accepted to be authentic. 
However, later investigations into the case revealed that 
the supposedly genuine handwriting samples provided 
for comparison purposes had in fact been written by the 
same forger (Konrad Kujau) who had been responsible for 
producing the diaries.
 
It was due to subsequent investigations by the 
West German police (at the behest of the publishing 
company Grüner and Jahr) that the Hitler diaries were 
eventually revealed as fraudulent. The police focused 
their attention not on the handwriting itself, but on 
the paper used in the diaries and the inks used to write 
the entries. They discovered that a paper-whitening 
substance had been used to treat the paper, a finding 
that was subsequently confirmed by scientists from 
the German government. As this chemical was not in 
use until after 1954, the author of the handwritten 
diaries could not possibly have been Adolf Hitler, who 
committed suicide in 1945. Other types of material 
used in the diaries provided additional evidence that 
the diaries had a more recent origin. For example, the 
polyester and viscose threads used to attach seals to 
the diaries were not available until after the Second 
World War. Furthermore, scientists demonstrated that 
the writing in one of the diaries (that for 1943) was 
less than 1 year old at the time of their examination. 
 
As a result of this case, both Heidemann, the staff 
journalist, and Kujau, the forger, received prison 
sentences, the former for misappropriating money from 
his employer.

been altered periodically and such changes have been recorded, then it should be 
possible to date the paper bearing the watermark, at least to within a given time 
period. In addition, there are other aspects of the production process that can be 
used to ascertain the authenticity of a questioned document. If certain materials 
are identified in the paper used for a disputed document that were not available 
at the purported time of writing, then this provides compelling evidence that the 
origin of these documents is more modern and that they are not, in fact, genuine. 
This type of evidence was brought to bear in the case of the Hitler diaries (Box 8.8).
8.7 Tears, folds, holes, obliterations, 
  
 erasures and indentations
In addition to those aspects of document examination previously discussed in this 
chapter, there are a number of other features that can yield important information 
concerning the history, origin and/or authenticity of questioned documents. These 
are examined in turn in this final section. 
8.7.1  Tears 
It may be possible to demonstrate that two or more pieces of paper were originally 
part of a larger sheet by mechanically fitting the torn pieces together. However, 
it should be borne in mind that there is a very real possibility that similar tear 
patterns have arisen as a result of two or more sheets of paper being superimposed 
on one another and torn simultaneously. Further evidence for the common origin of 
torn pieces of paper can be provided if other features, such as watermarks and/or 
writing, are present on both sides of the divide and can be clearly shown to match. 
An interesting historical example occurred in Lancashire, UK, in 1794. At this time, 
firearms were muzzle-loaded, which necessitated holding the projectile in place with 
wadding. In the case in question, a piece of paper wadding was recovered from the 
gunshot wound of a murder victim during autopsy. By the process of matching, this

 274  QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS
fragment was subsequently found to have been torn from a ballad sheet found in 
the pocket of an apprehended suspect. The suspect was found guilty and sentenced 
to death. In more recent times, the matching of torn sheets of paper can have 
particular relevance with regard to drug dealing, where portions of drugs may be 
wrapped in scraps of printed paper torn from newspapers or magazines. In such 
cases, it may be possible to match individual fragments and even to trace the torn 
pieces to the original newspaper or magazine from which they were taken. 
 
Some types of document are designed to incorporate a line of weakness, such 
as a series of short cuts in the paper or a line of perforations (either elliptical or 
circular), so that part of the document is more easily torn off. A common example 
is the chequebook, where cheques are torn out when required, each leaving behind 
a stub in the chequebook. Such tears are often irregular in nature, leaving pieces of 
paper of uneven length on either side of the tear. In these cases, it may be possible 
to make a match between two parts of a document torn along perforations. Other 
examples include books of matches, as may be found in arson cases, and perforated 
sheets of stamps.
8.7.2  Folds 
If a document shows evidence of folding, this may indicate that it has been 
contained within an envelope. If two or more separate sheets of paper show a similar 
pattern of folds, this may be consistent with their having been folded together in 
the same bundle at some time. 
 
The presence of folds on a document may yield significant information about the 
order in which ink lines have been made and, consequently, the order of writing. 
This is possible because the nature of the ink mark at the point of fold is different 
depending on whether it was made before or after the document was folded. 
Essentially, those ink marks made after folding contain comparatively more ink, 
partly because the surface of the paper acquires damage along the fold line.
8.7.3  Holes 
Holes present in documents are often the result of stapling, a method used for 
fastening two or more separate sheets of paper together, usually in the vicinity of the 
top left- or right-hand corner. In stapling, the open ends of the staple are forced to 
pierce through the sheets of paper and then bent towards each other under the final 
sheet, thus holding them all together. The position, number and even appearance of 
staple holes may provide useful information to the forensic document examiner. A 
close match between the position and size of staple holes on two, or more, separate 
sheets of paper is consistent with their having been previously attached together. If 
patterns of distortion around the staple holes on separate sheets are also similar, 
then this provides a further indication that they were once held to one another. 
8.7.4  Obliterations
During the course of their work, it is likely that document examiners will encounter 
portions of text that have been deliberately obliterated by the application of certain 
substances. These obliterations may have been made using the same ink that was 
used to create the original text, or a different substance such as another ink or a

correction fluid. Different approaches may be taken to decipher the writing hidden 
beneath the obliterating medium. In some cases, it may be possible to interpret the 
original writing by simply examining the reverse of the document. Naturally, under 
these circumstances, any writing apparent will appear as a mirror image. 
 
If the previous approach is not successful, examination under specialist lighting 
conditions will often enable the original writing to be read. There are several pieces 
of equipment commercially available for this purpose, such as the Video Spectral 
Comparator (VSC) built by Foster & Freeman Ltd (Figure 8.5) and the Docucenter 
3000 made by the Swiss firm Projectina AG. Among the features of this type of 
apparatus are a variety of light sources, including different wavelength bands of 
visible light, ultraviolet and infrared in reflectance mode, and transmitted white 
light. These features can be used to help distinguish between the different types 
of inks, if more than one is present (Figure 8.6), and can also be used to reveal 
writing obscured by correction fluid. It is worth noting that these types of apparatus 
can be used to examine objects other than questioned documents, including 
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Figure 8.3). In the case of typewritten 
material obliterated by correction fluid, the application of a suitable solvent may be 
successful. This renders the dried fluid translucent, for a brief period of time, thus 
enabling the typewriting underneath to be read.

 276  QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS
8.7.5  Erasures 
In some texts, the term ‘erasure’ is used to include the application of correction 
fluids. However, in this book, correction fluids are considered under the heading 
‘obliterations’ (see previous section) while erasures are interpreted as those 
instances where writing is actually removed from a document, using either 
mechanical or chemical means. The mechanical erasure of writing may involve 
the use of a suitably abrasive medium, for example hard rubber, or the removal of 
slivers of paper by means of a sharp instrument such as a knife. Chemical methods 
of erasure include the application of bleaching agents, which convert the dye into 
colourless materials, and the use of certain solvents. Whatever the method of 
erasure, it may be possible to detect minute traces of the original writing material, 
by, for example, inducing them to luminesce. 
8.7.6  Indentations
In forensic document analysis, indentations are primarily associated with writing. 
Indented writing has already been mentioned in this chapter with reference to 
the ‘trace-over’ method of forging signatures (Box 8.3). However, there are other 
circumstances under which indented writing may appear. This phenomenon 
commonly occurs when an individual writes on one document while it is resting

on another. In a similar manner, if, for example, a diary or pad of paper were used, 
indentations of the handwriting might be apparent, albeit with increasing faintness, 
on several subsequent pages. As well as direct impressions resulting from the act of 
writing itself, ‘secondary impressions’ may be created under certain circumstances. 
For example, impressions of writing may be transferred by contact between 
documents when they are stored together in close proximity. 
 
The method selected for the detection of indented writing is influenced by the 
depth to which the impression has been made. If the indented writing is sufficiently 
deep, it may be possible to read what is written by illuminating the document with 
an oblique light source. However, a more sensitive method, suitable for shallower 
impressions, is the application of the electrostatic detection apparatus (ESDA) 
(Box 8.9). It is noteworthy that ESDA does not always reveal the presence of some 
deep impressions that are nonetheless visible in oblique lighting. Thus, these two 
methods complement each other.
The electrostatic detection apparatus (ESDA) is a piece 
of equipment produced by Foster & Freeman Ltd. The 
technique of electrostatic detection, which has been 
routinely used by document examiners over the past 
30 years, is mainly employed for the visualisation of 
indented writing. However, newer applications have 
been developed for this non-destructive technique 
within the area of forensic document analysis. These 
include the examination of torn edges of paper for 
possible matching and the determination of the 
sequence of writing impressions and inkstrokes. 
ESDA may also be used to detect indented footwear 
impressions on paper surfaces (Chapter 4, Section 4.2).
Method of use
The piece of paper* bearing the indented writing is 
placed on the porous bronze plate of the ESDA and a thin 
Mylar® film positioned on top. Air is drawn downwards 
through the plate by a pump, thus holding the paper and 
transparent plastic sheet securely in position. The Mylar 
film is then given an electrostatic charge by moving a 
highly charged wire (known as a corona) backwards and 
forwards across its surface, at a height of approximately  
2 cm (Figure (a)). The potential of this electrostatic 
charge on the plastic sheet is determined by the dielectric 
properties of the paper, which, in turn, are influenced by 
the presence of indented writing. Essentially, those areas 
corresponding to the indentations will have the greatest 
opposite charge.
 
The next stage involves the application of 
photocopy toner powder to the Mylar sheet. This may 
be applied either in the form of a cloud of powder or 
by mixing it with glass beads. In the latter case, the 
mixture is poured over the surface of the sheet and 
the beads and excess powder collected in a trough by 
tilting the plate (Figure (b)). Whatever the method 
of application, the toner adheres selectively to those 
areas of greater potential which correspond to the 
indented writing. The clarity of the image produced on 
the Mylar sheet is positively correlated to the depth of 
the indentation. This grey or black image is temporary 
in nature but can be preserved for future use by the 
application of ‘sticky-backed’ transparent plastic. 
*Prior to ESDA examination, submitted documents must not have been 
treated with any solvent (such as used in the visualisation of latent 
fingerprints) or the technique will not work.

presence of more than one type of ink. Discuss the different methods that 
could have been used to obtain this information and the possible implication 
of these results for the authenticity of the document concerned.
6. The characteristics of paper are influenced by what happens during the

these may be used in (a) the comparison of paper and (b) the dating of paper.
7. Several separate typed sheets, all showing evidence of both stapling and 
folding, are submitted for forensic examination. Describe what types of 
comparative analysis the document examiner could use to ascertain whether 
these separate sheets share a common origin. 
 The term ‘questioned document’ may be applied to any 
document over which some query has been raised (usually 
concerning its authenticity or origin) and which may, as a 
result, be submitted for forensic investigation. Much of the 
work of the forensic document examiner is concerned with 
the comparison of questioned handwriting with specimen 
handwriting, with the aim of identifying the individual 
concerned. Signatures suspected of being forged also 
form a regular part of the document examiner’s caseload. 
If genuine signatures are available, then a comparison 
can be made between them and the suspect one, in a 
similar manner to that used for handwriting comparisons. 
However, it is not usually possible to identify the person 
responsible for forging a signature.
 In addition to handwriting and signature investigation, 
the forensic document examiner may be asked to scrutinise 
disputed office documents, such as those produced by 
typing or word-processing, or reproduced by photocopying. 
Information sought may include the type of machine used, 
whether several documents have been generated on the 
same machine and/or whether a particular document can 
be shown to have originated from a given machine.
 In the case of printed documents that are suspected of being 
counterfeit items, the primary concern of the document 
examiner is to establish whether they are authentic, by 
comparison with examples of the genuine article. In this 
respect, the analysis of ink and paper may supply significant 
information, although these types of analysis have a 
much wider applicability within document examination. 
For example, a comparison of ink samples taken from a 
document can be used to ascertain whether or not it has 
been altered. Finally, the examination of any tears, folds, 
holes, obliterations, erasures or indentations present on 
questioned documents may yield valuable information 
concerning their authenticity, origin and/or history.

 280  QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS
8. This case concerns a disputed letter. The alleged recipient of this letter 
claimed that the reason that the signature appeared on a different portion of 
paper from that of the text is because the two were separated by the action of 
an automatic letter-opener, which not only cut the envelope but also severed 
the letter along a fold. The purported sender of the letter claimed that she 
had never signed the document concerned and that the supposed recipient 
must have fabricated the excuse outlined above. Given the two portions of 
paper, how would you proceed to establish whose explanation is more likely 
to be the truth?

(as currently amended), is ‘a lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which 
any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged …’. Also included in this legal 
definition are all prohibited weapons, any component of these prohibited or lethal 
barrelled weapons, and any accessory adapted or designed to deaden the sound or 
decrease the flash produced by the weapon being fired. 
 
Criminals use firearms to shoot and beat people, resulting in injury and death. They 
also employ these weapons to intimidate and to cause damage to property. Although 
it is little comfort, as indicated by the data presented in Figure 9.1, by international 
standards, the availability of firearms is relatively low in the UK, as is the level of 
firearms-related death. Furthermore, the proportion of crime that involves firearms is 
relatively small. Home Office statistics reveal that for England and Wales, all notifiable 
offences in which the use of firearms was reported and the police recorded remained 
at a level of 0.3–0.4 per cent of all notifiable offences throughout the period 1998 to 
2009. Moreover, if air weapons are excluded, the percentage drops significantly, for 
example in the reporting year 2008–09, the figure decreases from 0.3 to 0.175 per 
cent. Nonetheless, the criminal use of firearms remains a serious issue. The Home 
Office reports that for England and Wales, in the year 2008–09, there was a total of 
14 250 offences in which the use of firearms was reported and that the police recorded 
(of which 6042 involved an air weapon). Included within these were 41 homicides and

774 offences of attempted murder or grievous bodily harm with intent. It should be 
noted, however, that since the recording year 2003–04 the total number of offences 
has dropped very significantly, from 24 094 in 2003–04 to 14 250 in 2008–09.
 
In cases in which the criminal use of firearms is suspected, the examination of 
any recovered firearms and/or related artefacts (spent cartridge cases and bullets, 
clothing, wounds, trace materials, etc.) is an extremely important part of forensic 
science. It can be crucial in establishing that a crime has been committed. In cases 
of wounding or murder, it can frequently be used to help link the victim with the 
weapon and the weapon with the assailant. Furthermore, such examination can also 
form a pivotal part of crime scene reconstruction. In order to facilitate the efficient 
storage and retrieval of information obtained during the forensic examination of 
firearms and ammunition, the National Firearms Forensic Intelligence Database 
(NFFID) was established in 2003. This was replaced in 2008 by the National 
Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) database. Linked into this national database 
are a number of Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) comparators sited 
in laboratories known as NABIS hubs. The use of the IBIS automated system allows 
comparisons to be made of the characteristics of spent ammunition from unsolved 
crimes and weapons that have been recovered. This integrated system allows the 
rapid transmission of firearms intelligence to the relevant agencies.
 
This chapter will introduce the reader to the salient aspects of the forensic 
study of both firearms and the consequences of their discharge. It opens with a 
description of the types of firearms and ammunition that are more commonly 
encountered in forensic work (Section 9.1). This is followed by an exploration of 
what happens when a firearm is discharged (Section 9.2) and the information that 
may be obtained from an examination of firearms and spent ammunition (Sections 
9.3 and 9.4 respectively). The chapter closes with an overview of the information 
that can be gained from the analysis of the material that is vented from a firearm 
other than the projectile and any wadding (Section 9.5).

TYPES OF FIREARM AND AMMUNITION  283
9.1 Types of firearm and ammunition
This section is concerned with a brief description of the most common types of 
firearm and ammunition that are encountered in forensic casework in mainland UK. 
The meaning of the key technical terms used in this and following sections is given 
in Box 9.1. 
Given below is an alphabetical list of key terms that are 
frequently encountered in the field of forensic firearms 
examination, together with their normal meanings in 
this context. Words or phrases shown in italics within 
the meanings given are listed as key terms elsewhere 
in this box.
ammunition: that which is, or may be, fired in a gun. 
Also, that which is, or may be, discharged from an air 
weapon.
assault rifle: a rifle designed for military use that can 
be fired in either an automatic or a self-loading (i.e. 
semi-automatic) manner.
automatic: when fired, will discharge repeatedly either 
until the trigger is no longer pressed or until the 
weapon’s magazine runs out of ammunition.
barrel: a tube which directs the projectile.
black powder: gunpowder.
bolt-action firearm: a firearm in which, after firing, 
the manual pulling back and pushing forward of a 
bolt is required to cause the empty cartridge case to 
be ejected from the weapon and a live cartridge to be 
placed in the firing chamber.
bore of a shotgun: the gauge of the weapon concerned.
breech: the end of the barrel or, where present, the 
chamber that is furthest from the muzzle.
bullets: this word has several meanings: (1) those 
small-arms projectiles fired one at a time from the 
barrel of a gun; (2) small spheres; (3) projectiles 
used for a small-calibre gun. (It is the first of these 
meanings that is used in this book. Information on 
bullet design is provided in Box 9.5.)
calibre: in its simplest meaning, this is the nominal 
and approximate internal diameter of a given firearm’s 
barrel. For guns with rifled barrels, the units of this are 
either inches, expressed as decimals (as in .45”), or 
millimetres (as in 9 mm). When used as a designation for 
cartridges, this diameter information is supplemented 
by letters, other numbers and/or words that signify 
something specific about the cartridge. For example, 
these supplementary characters might indicate the 
date of the adoption of the cartridge by an army, the 
length of the cartridge or the weight of propellant 
that it contains. In this form, it can be thought of as 
a ‘short-hand’ that is used to specify the cartridge type 
that a firearm is designed to fire and an attempt to give 
a unique designation to this cartridge type. In the case 
of most shotguns, the calibre of the weapon concerned 
is indicated by its gauge, a parameter that is more 
commonly referred to in the UK as its bore.
cartridge: the defining characteristic of any small-arms 
cartridge is that it contains a measured amount of 
propellant. However, as shown in figure (a), the vast 
majority of such cartridges also have a case to hold 
the propellant, a primer and a projectile (i.e. bullet) or 
projectiles (i.e. shot).
chamber: that part of a firearm designed to hold the 
cartridge while it is fired.
double-action revolver: a revolver that, when the trigger 
is pulled with the hammer in the uncocked position, 
will rotate its magazine to bring a new cartridge into 
the firing position, cock and fire. Note, however, in the 
strictest use of this term it refers to a revolver that in 
addition to functioning as described in the previous 
sentence will also function as a single-action revolver.

double-base propellant: smokeless powder based on 
cellulose nitrate and glyceryl trinitrate.
gauge of a shotgun: a measure of the calibre of the 
weapon concerned. It refers to the number of solid 
lead spheres, each of which has a diameter that will 
just pass along the inside of the barrel of the gun, that 
make 1 pound (lb) in weight. In this context, the term 
bore is synonymous with gauge.
gunpowder: a mixture of saltpetre (potassium nitrate), 
charcoal (carbon) and sulphur used as a firearms 
propellant; now almost wholly replaced for this purpose 
by smokeless powder.
hammer: a device that is common to the design of 
many firearms, which are collectively known as hammer 
guns. In such guns, the hammer is spring-loaded when 
in the cocked position. When the trigger is pulled, the 
hammer flies from the cocked to the uncocked position. 
At the end of this movement, depending on the details 
of the gun’s design, either the hammer’s impact causes 
a firing pin to strike the cartridge or the hammer strikes 
the cartridge directly. In either case, the portion of the 
cartridge that is hit is that which contains the primer 
and, consequently, the gun is made to fire. In most 
hammer guns, the upper part of the rear of the hammer 
ends in a spur, by which the shooter can pull the 
hammer to the cocked position. Note that guns without 
hammers, or without visible hammers, are referred to as 
hammerless. Semi-hammerless guns only have the spur 
of the hammer showing.
handgun: a pistol.
lever-action: see manual firearm.
magazine: a store for ammunition. Many firearms have 
inbuilt magazines.
manual firearm: a firearm in which the shooter 
actuates a fairly sophisticated mechanism using, for 
example, a manually actuated bolt-action rifle, a lever 
(lever-action) or sliding handle (pump-action) to load 
a live cartridge into the firing chamber in place of any 
spent cartridge case present.
muzzle: that end of the barrel of the firearm from which 
the projectile(s) exit(s) the weapon.
pistol: this has two common meanings: (1) a firearm 
designed to be held in and discharged from one hand, 
whether single-shot, self-loading or revolver in design; (2) 
as in sense 1 but restricted to single-shot and self-loading 
firearms. (In this book, it is the first of these definitions 
that is used.)
primer: consists of a primer cup, priming compound 
and anvil (figure (a)). When struck by the firing pin, 
the cup is indented, causing the priming compound to 
explode by compressing it against the anvil. The flash of 
this explosion passes through a hole in the head of the 
cartridge and ignites the propellant.
propellant: material that undergoes a chemical reaction 
resulting in the rapid production of gas that is used to 
force the projectile or projectiles along and out of the 
barrel of a firearm when the weapon is discharged.
pump-action: see manual firearm.
revolver: a firearm designed to contain multiple 
cartridges within a cylindrical magazine and that has 
a mechanism that, by the progressive partial rotation 
of this cylinder, brings each cartridge in line with the 
barrel so that it can be fired. In order to replenish the 
ammunition within the cylinder, the spent cartridge 
cases must be manually replaced with live cartridges.

rifle: a firearm with a rifled barrel, which fires bullets 
and that is designed to be discharged while held in both 
hands and, in most cases, while held against a shoulder.
rifled barrel: a gun barrel featuring a series of spiral 
grooves and lands along the length of its interior 
surface (see figure (b)). 
round: a military term for a cartridge.
safety catch: a system that is under the control of 
the shooter via the movement of a lever, or similar 
device, such that when the lever is in one position, 
pulling the trigger will not discharge the weapon, 
whereas, when it is in another, the gun will fire when 
the trigger is pulled.
self-loading firearm: a firearm that utilises some of the 
energy of one discharge to extract the case of the spent 
cartridge from the firing chamber, eject the empty case 
from the gun, re-cock the firing mechanism and load a 
live cartridge from the weapon’s magazine into the firing 
chamber ready for the next discharge, which must be 
actuated by renewed pressure on the trigger.
semi-automatic: self-loading.
shot: the pellets that are designed to be fired many at a 
time from a shotgun.
shotgun: a firearm, the barrel or barrels of which have a 
smooth (i.e. not rifled) interior and which is designed to 
fire shot, and to be discharged while held in both hands 
and, in most cases, while held against a shoulder.
single-action revolver: a revolver that must be cocked by 
pulling the hammer back with the thumb in order to be 
able to fire the next shot by squeezing the trigger (for 
comparison, see double-action revolver).

While a forensic examiner working in this field will meet a wide range of weapons, 
most of them will fall into one of four categories: namely, handguns (including air 
pistols), shotguns, rifles (including air rifles) and sub-machine guns. Among the 
others encountered will be blank firing guns and deactivated firearms that have 
been converted to fire live cartridges, and imitation firearms. 
 
As indicated in the introduction to this chapter, in England and Wales offences 
involving air weapons make up the vast bulk of notifiable offences in which firearms 
are reported to have been used. Air weapons, whether pistols or rifles, use a pulse 
of high-pressure air to force the projectile along and out of the barrel. In most 
such weapons, the air is pressurised by a piston moving down a cylinder under 
the force of a compressed spring. The air in the cylinder then passes through a 
port into the barrel to force the projectile to move. The shooter then has to 
recompress the spring manually prior to the next shot. In many designs of air rifle, 
this is done by breaking the gun around a hinge that operates at the breech. This 
simultaneously compresses the spring, forces the piston back along the cylinder and 
opens the breech so that the shooter can load a projectile into the breech end of 
the barrel. The piston and the compressed spring are held back by a mechanism 
until the trigger is pulled and the gun is discharged. Pneumatic air weapons do not 
pressurise the air at the moment of discharge. Instead, they contain a reservoir 
of pre-pressurised air, which is released by means of a valve when the trigger is 
pulled. Depending on the design, this reservoir is replenished by, for example, a 
hand pump or from a pressurised air bottle of the type used by an underwater diver. 
A closely related system is also used in some weapons, known as gas-powered guns, 
in which compressed or liquefied gas (usually carbon dioxide) held in a replaceable 
reservoir is used to expel the projectile when the trigger is pulled.
 
Projectiles discharged from air weapons are capable of killing; therefore, as these 
are barrelled weapons, they can be considered as firearms under English law (see 
the Introduction to this chapter). However, with the exception of air weapons that 
are declared by the Secretary of State to be especially dangerous and those that 
discharge projectiles with energies greater than 8.1 J (6 ft lb) for pistols and 16.3 J 
(12 ft lb) for rifles, these weapons are less tightly controlled in this country than are 
other firearms.
 
Although air weapon offences form the bulk of firearms offences in England and 
Wales, they rarely lead to death. For this reason, the remainder of this chapter 
deals almost exclusively with firearms other than air weapons. However, it should 
be noted that the kinds of information that can be gained from the examination of 
single-base propellant: smokeless powder based on 
cellulose nitrate.
single-shot firearm: a firearm that, once discharged, 
requires the shooter to manually extract the spent 
cartridge case and replace it with a live cartridge before 
the weapon can be fired again.
small arms: firearms that are small and light enough to 
be hand-carried.
smokeless powder: firearms propellant that is based 
on either cellulose nitrate or a combination of cellulose 
nitrate and glyceryl trinitrate (forming single-base and 
double-base propellants respectively).
sub-machine gun: a compact, self-loading or automatic 
weapon that is designed to be discharged while held in 
both hands and to fire self-loading pistol ammunition.

marks on lead pellets that have been discharged from air weapons (Figure 9.2a) are 
the same as those which can be obtained from the examination of bullets fired from 
other types of small arm. The information available from the examination of spent 
projectiles is described in Section 9.4.
 
As indicated in Figures 9.3 and 9.4, handguns are of particular importance. Home 
Office statistics reveal them to be the most common category of non-air weapon 
firearm to be identified as being involved in offences recorded in England and Wales. 
Indeed, according to a Home Office statistical bulletin published in 2010 (see Smith 
et al. (2010) in the Further reading section), in the year 2008–09 handguns were 
identified as being involved in 52 per cent of such cases. However, it should be noted 
that although the overall proportion of recorded offences involving non-air weapon 
firearms in England and Wales in the year 2008–09 in which firearms were discharged 
was 33 per cent, handguns were fired in only 10 per cent of recorded offences in which 
they were used. In the year in question, handguns caused death or serious injury in  
32 per cent of the offences in which they were fired, compared with 28 per cent in the 
case of shotguns and 6 per cent in the case of other non-air weapon firearms.

encountered by firearms examiners

Some handguns encountered in the forensic context are single-shot weapons. 
However, most are either revolvers or self-loading firearms. Weapons that can be 
accurately described as automatic pistols are a rarity (the term ‘automatic’ is 
sometimes erroneously applied to self-loading weapons).
 
The majority of all handguns have rifled barrels and are designed to fire bullets. 
Typical ammunition of the types designed to be fired in each of revolvers and self-
loading pistols is shown in diagrammatic form in Figure 9.2. Note that a revolver 
cartridge is rimmed (i.e. its case has a projecting rim that extends all around its 
closed, or head, end) but does not have an extractor groove. In contrast, cartridges 
intended for use in self-loading pistols do have extractor grooves and, depending on 
design, may or may not have a rim (the cartridge illustrated in Figure 9.2 is rimless). 
 
It is worth noting that although revolvers retain the spent cartridge cases until 
they are manually removed, self-loading pistols eject the spent cases a fraction of a 
second after the cartridge has been fired. This means that spent cartridge cases are 
more likely to be found at a shooting incident involving a self-loading pistol than 
one in which a revolver was used.

(more common than either bolt- or lever-action) or self-loading. Note, however, that 
single-barrel shotguns that can be used in either pump-action or self-loading mode 
are also now available and that revolver shotguns also exist. Double-barrel sporting 
shotguns in the UK have traditionally been of the hinged barrel design. By virtue 
of this hinge, the shooter can open the gun to have access to its chambers, thereby 
allowing the exchange of spent cartridges with live ones. 
 
In most cases, the muzzle end of a shotgun barrel contains a tapered section, such 
that the internal diameter of the barrel concerned is slightly smaller at the muzzle 
than elsewhere along its length. The purpose of this constriction, which is referred 
to as the choke, is to decrease the natural tendency of the pellets to disperse during 
flight. It is the norm for the two barrels of double-barrel weapons to have different 
degrees of choke. Some shotguns have screw-in choke tubes, which may be replaced, 
allowing the degree of choke to be altered, while others have devices that allow the 
shooter to alter even more readily the degree of choke. In many cases, shotguns 
used by criminals have had their barrel(s) deliberately shortened so as to make the 
firearms concerned easier to conceal. Such guns, which are called sawn-off shotguns, 
will have had their chokes removed when their barrels were shortened.
 
Among both single-barrel and double-barrel shotguns, 12-bore firearms are the 
most common. The designation 12-bore (also called 12-gauge) is in fact a proxy 
measure of the internal diameter of the gun’s barrel. It refers to the fact that 12 
spheres of solid lead with this diameter weigh 1 pound (1 lb = 0.454 kg).
 
Other than size, the essential features of modern shotgun cartridges remain 
the same irrespective of the bore of the weapon in which they are intended to be 
fired. They have a metal base, in the centre of which is the primer cup, and plastic 
or paper sides which are crimp sealed at the top. Shotgun cartridges contain one or 
more wads between the propellant and the shot. These may be made of a number of 
materials, including felt, cardboard or plastic. They are disc-shaped and are there to 
make a more or less gas-tight seal with the barrel and to cushion the shot while it is 
accelerated out of the gun during firing. In modern cartridges, a plastic cup holds the 
shot so as to keep it away from the inside of the barrel during discharge. In cartridges 
with plastic cup wads (Figure 9.2), this cup is designed to also serve as the wad.
 
Rifles and sub-machine guns are briefly described in Box 9.1. As in the case 
of shotguns, rifles may be single-shot, bolt-action, lever-action, pump-action or 
self-loading, and there are some revolver rifles. Additionally, automatic rifles 
are available, a variant of which is the assault rifle. Typical rifle ammunition is 
illustrated in Figure 9.2. Sub-machine guns are designed to fire self-loading pistol 
ammunition, the essential features of which are also shown in Figure 9.2.
9.2 Internal, external and 
  
 terminal ballistics
Ballistics is the scientific study of projectile motion. When considering small arms, 
distinction is drawn between internal ballistics (also called interior ballistics), 
external ballistics (also known as exterior ballistics) and terminal ballistics.
Muzzle
That end of the 
firearm’s barrel 
from which the 
projectile(s) exit(s) 
the weapon.

 
INTERNAL, EXTERNAL AND TERMINAL BALLISTICS  291
 
Internal ballistics considers the processes by which the propellant’s chemical 
energy is transferred to the kinetic energy possessed by the projectile(s), the efficiency 
of this transfer and, importantly, what happens to the projectile(s) as it/they move 
along the barrel of the firearm. It is during this time that the rifling (if present) and 
imperfections within the interior wall of the barrel impart marks onto the bullet or, in 
some instances, shotgun wadding (as appropriate). As described in Section 9.4, such 
marks have the potential to provide both class and individualising characteristics to 
aid the identification of the weapon that fired the projectile concerned.
 
The behaviour of the projectile(s) once they have left the barrel and before they 
impact with their target is the domain of external ballistics. This is of importance 
to the firearms examiner who is concerned with crime scene reconstruction. A 
knowledge of external ballistics will help to establish where the perpetrator of a 
given shooting could possibly have been located when the firearm was discharged.
 
Terminal ballistics is the study of what occurs when projectiles strike their 
targets. There are a number of reasons why this is of value to the forensic firearms 
examiner. For example, when a bullet strikes a person with sufficient energy, it will 
create an entry wound. In cases in which such a projectile does not lose all of its 
kinetic energy within the body of the individual concerned, it will also create an exit 
wound. A knowledge of the characteristics of these types of wound will allow one 
to be distinguished from the other, enabling, for example, examination to reveal 
whether a bullet that killed someone by passing through his or her chest did so 
from front to back or back to front. Clearly, such information may be valuable in 
crime scene reconstruction and in the corroboration or refutation of the account of 
the incident given by those who witnessed it.
 
The patterns of damage caused by the discharge of a firearm are influenced 
by each of internal, external and terminal ballistics. Clearly, therefore, there are 
multiple variables that control these patterns. However, many of these are held 
constant if the same gun, firing the same ammunition, is used for each shot 
discharged at a fresh target. Under these circumstances, in the case of shotguns, 
the damage pattern is largely a function of the distance from the muzzle to the 
target (i.e. the range). Using this knowledge, the firearms examiner may conduct 
a series of test firings with the shotgun believed to have been involved in a given 
shooting. Each such firing will be at a card target, set at a known range and 
will, ideally, use cartridges recovered from the scene or the suspect, or identical 
ammunition. The ranges of these firings will be varied, allowing correlations to be 
drawn between range and each of pellet spread and, where range permits, wadding 
strikes, blackening and the impact of unburned powder (wadding and, to a greater 
extent, unburned powder and the materials responsible for blackening are not able 
to travel as far as the pellets). The correlations can then be used to establish the 
likely minimum and maximum distances from the gun’s muzzle to the target in the 
shooting incident under examination.
 
Obviously, in cases involving bullet discharge, pellet spread information is not 
available for the establishment of the range of firing. However, in such cases, at 
ranges of less than 1 metre, the effects of muzzle flash, gas ejection, blackening and 
the impact of unburned powder can be used to estimate muzzle-to-skin distances. 
In contact or near-contact shots, unburned powder will be found within the wound 
and muzzle flash may have caused charring around the wound’s exterior (unless

there is a fully gas-tight seal between the gun and the skin). Also, large volumes 
of gas ejected from the gun may have entered the wound. The high pressures that 
are thereby produced in the wound cavity frequently result in the formation of 
radial splits in the skin around the entrance wound; resulting in a characteristically 
stellate (i.e. star-shaped) pattern (Figure 9.5). They may also press the skin against 
the muzzle of the gun with enough force to cause bruising in the form of an image 
of the muzzle of the gun. This image may be sufficiently clear and characteristic 
to allow the probable model of the gun to be established. Gas escaping from the 
high-pressure zone along surfaces that are approximately at right angles to the 
direction of the shot may leave blackening between layers of clothing, the clothing 
and the skin and/or, within the wound, across the surface of substantial bones. At

ranges greater than 5 cm, the direction travelled by some of the materials ejected 
along with the bullet deviates sufficiently from the line of fire to blacken the skin 
and ‘tattoo’ the victim with unburned particles of propellant (Figure 9.6). As range 
increases, the area covered by these marks increases, their intensity decreases 
and the ability of the particles to puncture and thereby tattoo the skin decreases. 
The test firing of the weapon involved, at card targets set at known distances from 
the muzzle of the weapon, will allow the examiner to interpret the spread and 
intensity of the patterns found around the wound of the victim in terms of the likely 
minimum and maximum range of the shot. As the effects seen alter significantly 
with the type of ammunition used, such tests should ideally be carried out using 
cartridges recovered from the scene or suspect, or identical ammunition. 
 
Whatever the type of weapon involved, establishment of the range over which it 
was fired can have significant evidential value. It may help to corroborate or refute 
accounts given of the incident by those present at the scene and it can help in the 
reconstruction of the incident. As explored in Box 9.3 later in the chapter, it may 
be of particular value in establishing whether a particular fatal shooting could have 
been the result of suicide.
 
Another aspect of projectile motion that is of significant forensic importance is 
that of ricochet (i.e. the deviation in the flight-path of a projectile as a consequence 
of impact). If death has occurred due to ricochet, rather than a shot aimed at the 
victim, this information is of evidential value. It is known that the propensity for 
ricochet is not the same for all projectiles. For example, low-velocity, heavy bullets 
are more likely to ricochet than are high-velocity ones that are both light and 
designed to expand within the intended quarry (which, rather than ricochet, are 
likely to break up on impact). The examination of the scene may reveal evidence of 
the incidence of ricochet, in the form of damage at the impact site(s) concerned. 
Also, recovered bullets may have been marked in a fashion that provides evidence of 
the surface from which ricochet has occurred. Furthermore, particles (e.g. of soil,

found on the bullet’s surface.
9.3 The examination of suspect firearms
For safety reasons, it is vitally important to ensure that any firearm that is to be 
stored or examined is first inspected by a competent person to make sure that it 
is not loaded. There are a number of reasons why a firearms examiner may need to 
load and, in many instances, test-fire a suspect weapon. For example, this will be 
required if spent cartridge cases, known to have been test-fired with the suspect 
firearm, are to be collected for the purposes of comparison with spent cartridge 
cases recovered from the scene of a shooting incident. Clearly, after any such 
occasion during which the firearm concerned is loaded, checks must be carried out 
to ensure that it is no longer loaded before it is stored or examined.
 
To achieve its full potential, the examination of any given firearm must be carried 
out in a planned, systematic and logical fashion. There are actions that if carried 
out in the wrong order may destroy valuable information and may even place the 
firearms examiner in danger of injury. For example, if a weapon is test-fired before 
the inside of its barrel has been inspected, this will preclude the detection of small 
particles of material of potential evidential value (such as gunshot residues) 
that were lodged within it prior to the test-firing. Furthermore, the presence 
of obstructions within the barrel that make it unsafe to be fired may be missed, 
possibly leading to the bursting of the weapon upon test-firing.
 
The types of observation that an examiner will make will, to some extent, be 
determined by the circumstances of the case. However, routine observations 
recorded during the examination of a firearm will typically include:
 its type (e.g. shotgun, self-loading pistol);
 its condition as received (recorded with the aid of photographs, where 
practicable);
 the number of cartridges that it (or its magazine) can hold;
 its manufacturer, make and model, bearing in mind that there have been 
instances in which:
– unscrupulous gunsmiths have been known to produce counterfeit goods 
that are designed to appear to be those of a well-reputed brand,
– guns designed to be able to fire only blanks have been adapted to  
fire projectiles,
– individual amateur gunsmiths have produced ‘home-made’ guns;
 its serial number (serial numbers are frequently removed by criminals but, in 
many such cases, may still be rendered legible (Box 9.2));
 its calibre (this information is normally embodied in the make and model of 
the gun concerned; however, it is quite possible that the weapon concerned 
has been altered since manufacture – this is particularly likely in the case of 
illegally reactivated guns that had been previously legitimately deactivated 
and sold as non-firearms);

 the positions of the safety catch (where present) and any levers that allow

loading and automatic modes of firing).
 
The examination of a given suspect firearm may help to answer a number 
of important questions. Unfortunately, space does not permit an exhaustive 
description of the means by which this may be done. However, a selection of such 
Among the products habitually stolen by criminals 
are certain types that are routinely stamped with 
identifying serial numbers during the manufacturing 
process. Such groups include metal items, such as 
firearms and motor vehicle engines, and plastic 
products, for example mobile phones. When such stolen 
goods are recovered, it is often the case that the thief 
has erased, or attempted to erase, the serial number in 
order to conceal the identity of the object. However, it 
is possible, in some cases, to restore the original serial 
number to a state in which it can be read.
 
Serial numbers are impressed into objects during 
manufacture, either using steel dies, where the 
receiving surface is metallic, or heat stamps, where 
the product is plastic. However it is applied, it is 
the changes induced by this stamping process in the 
substrate below the impression that are key to the 
restoration of erased serial numbers.
 
In the case of metallic objects, the metal crystals 
below (and around) the impressed number are placed 
under strain by the stamping process and consequently 
become more electrochemically reactive. Erasure of the 
serial number, for example by grinding or filing, may 
not go deep enough to remove this underlying layer 
completely. If an appropriate etching reagent is then 
applied, the areas of stress react more readily with it 
and, consequently, the serial number may reappear. 
To give an example, Fry’s Reagent is the one most 
commonly used for the recovery of serial numbers on 
iron and steel firearm components. This is composed of 
a mixture of hydrochloric acid (80 ml), water (60 ml), 
copper(II) chloride (12.9 g) and ethanol (50 ml). 
Another example of an etching agent, which is suitable 
for aluminium alloys, is Vinella’s solution. This is 
composed of glycerol (30 ml), hydrofluoric acid (20 ml) 
and nitric acid (10 ml). In the case of aluminium alloys 
which may contain silicon, Hume–Rothery solution 
(copper(II) chloride (200 g), hydrochloric acid (5 ml) 
and water (1000 ml)) may be used, applied between 
stages of application of Vinella’s solution.
 
In the case of plastic items, the impression of serial 
numbers using a heat stamp causes shrinkage of the 
surrounding polymers. If a serial number is erased from 
a plastic surface, it may be restored by the application 
of an appropriate solvent. This causes preferential 
swelling in those areas affected by heat which underlie 
the original serial number.

questions is given below, along with an indication of some of the key means by 
which firearms examination may help to answer them.
9.3.1 With whom or what has this firearm been in  
 
contact?
During the commission of a crime, any firearm involved will have been brought 
into contact with a number of surfaces and substances. Each time this occurs, such 
contact may well mark the gun and/or transfer material to the weapon that is of 
evidential value. Examples of these types of contact and the evidence that they may 
well produce are given in Table 9.1. From this, it is apparent that the careful and 
systematic search for and evaluation of such evidence may be able to help establish 
links between the weapon and with whom or what it has been in contact. However, 
it must be borne in mind that the strength of the link varies with the ability of the 
evidence to yield individualising characteristics and the availability of appropriate 
control samples. For example, a good-quality fingerprint found on a gun will provide 
unequivocal evidence that the person who left the print had indeed touched the 
firearm concerned, provided that a control print is available for comparison

(Chapter 4, Section 4.1.3). However, if gunshot residues were found within the 
barrel of a gun they may reveal class characteristics that, while consistent with 
the firing of a particular cartridge, could not prove that the cartridge in question 
was fired in that particular gun. For more on the analysis of gunshot residues, see 
Section 9.5, and for a discussion on the difference between class and individualising 
characteristics, see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1.
9.3.2  Could this firearm be responsible for firing the shots 
that were discharged at a given shooting incident?
Evidence recovered from the scene of a shooting incident may include spent 
cartridge cases, projectiles and/or gunshot residues. Depending on the type of 
weapon involved, the projectiles may be bullet(s) or shot and wadding. Also, the 
characteristics of any damage or injury caused by the shooting will normally  
be known.
 
Early in the inspection of the suspect weapon, its type will have been established. 
If, for the sake of argument, it is found to be a pistol designed to fire .22 rim-
fire cartridges, this would not be able to produce the damage caused by a 12-bore 
shotgun. If such damage is known to have been caused by the only weapon used 
in the incident, then, clearly, the pistol could not have been the gun concerned. 
Similarly, if, on the basis of recovered spent ammunition, the incident was known 
to have involved the firing of a single .45 centre-fire cartridge, this is compelling 
evidence that the suspect pistol described above could not have fired the shot.

While this type of reasoning is apparently obvious, care does need to be taken in 
many cases. This is because, as discussed in Section 9.4, it is often possible to fire a 
weapon, either with or without adaptation, using a range of cartridge types. To give 
an extreme example, shotguns can be adapted to fire pistol cartridges.
 
If a cleaning patch is passed down the barrel of a suspect weapon before it is 
test-fired, any gunshot residues present will be sampled. If such residues are found, 
this is evidence that the gun has indeed been fired (although it is generally not 
possible to say when this occurred). Furthermore, such residues may reveal class 
characteristics that agree with those of gunshot residues found at the scene 
(Section 9.5) or even particles of unburned propellant that can be compared with 
propellant found in unused ammunition known to be in the possession of the 
suspect.
 
In the case of sawn-off weapons, inspection of the barrel(s) may reveal small 
particles of metallic swarf with a composition that matches that of the barrel. Such 
evidence would be consistent with the weapon not having been discharged since it 
was shortened.
 
The test firing of the suspect weapon will provide control samples of spent 
cartridge cases. Similarly, spent bullets may be collected if the gun concerned is 
test-fired into a bullet recovery system designed to capture the fired projectile in an 
undamaged state. This consists of a large container filled with a readily deformed 
material (e.g. water or cotton waste) that will, nonetheless, slow the bullet to a 
standstill within a relatively short distance. The items collected during test-firing 
can then be compared with used cartridge cases and projectiles retrieved from the 
crime scene. As discussed in Section 9.4, the information that such comparisons can 
reveal is frequently individualising, allowing a given weapon to be unambiguously 
linked to a given incident.
9.3.3  Could this firearm have been unintentionally  
discharged?
Those accused of perpetrating an illegal shooting incident in which someone has 
been killed or injured rarely admit to intentionally firing the weapon involved. For 
example, it may be claimed that the safety catch malfunctioned, or that the firearm 
was discharged:
 while it was being uncocked to make it safe;
 when the spur of the hammer of the gun in an uncocked position was 
accidentally struck from behind or caught on clothing; or 
 when the cocked gun hit the floor during a scuffle.
All of these are indeed possible, at least with some guns, and the firearms examiner 
will wish to provide as much information as possible to assist the jury in establishing 
whether, in the particular case under consideration, such an explanation is credible. 
Also, in cases in which it is believed that a fatal shot was self-inflicted, the examin-
ation of the firearm concerned may be of value in establishing whether the death 
was suicide or the result of an accident (see Box 9.3 below).

THE EXAMINATION OF SUSPECT FIREARMS  299
 
In either of the scenarios outlined previously, the examiner will carry out 
investigations and mechanical tests on the weapon concerned. The exact nature 
and number of these will be determined by the case under consideration. However, 
typical among these investigations and tests are the following:
 An evaluation of the weight of the trigger pull (a parameter that is also known 
as the trigger pressure) of the weapon concerned. This is tested because 
firearms with light trigger pulls are prone to accidental discharge. Typical 
trigger pulls for various classes of firearm are given in Table 9.2. It would be 
normal for a firearms examiner to include in his or her report a comparison 
of the trigger pull found on the suspect weapon with that expected for the 
type of weapon concerned. It should be noted that the weight of a trigger 
pull for a given firearm will depend on the exact location on the trigger that 
the load is placed and the direction relative to the long axis of the weapon 
in which it is applied. Therefore, it may be of value to the jury to know the 
minimum trigger pull achievable, as well as that obtained when the load is 
applied directly away from the muzzle and in the centre of the trigger as 
would occur in normal use. Also, it should be noted that some rifles and 
pistols have mechanisms that enable the shooter to choose between a normal 
trigger pull and a very light set trigger (also known as a hair trigger), which 
is adjustable. Rifles fitted with these devices can typically be adjusted to give 
a pull of ≤0.3 kg. Clearly, the examiner should report if such a device is fitted 
and, if so, the setting to which it was adjusted when the examiner received 
the firearm.
 An examination of the firearm to establish the operation of any safety catch 
and the presence and operation of any other internal safety devices present. 
For example, such devices are incorporated in the design of modern revolvers 
so that they cannot be fired except by pulling the trigger (older designs 
may be fired by a substantial blow to the rear of the hammer when in the 
uncocked position). 
 An examination of the condition of the safety devices and the firing 
mechanism with an evaluation of whether a malfunction could have occurred 
within these systems, allowing the firearm to be unintentionally discharged.
 Jarring tests in which the weapon is dropped in a controlled manner onto a 
suitably hard but cushioned surface from a variety of heights and in which

the hammer (if present) may be struck with a soft mallet. The purpose of 
these tests is to see if a blow to the gun could make the firing pin contact the 
primer-containing portion of a cartridge with sufficient force to fire the gun 
without the trigger being pulled. When interpreting the results of such tests, 
the examiner will be mindful of the fact that the sensitivity to impact of the 
primer will, in many cases, differ from one brand of cartridge to the next and 
even from one batch to the next.
 Tests to establish whether the action of closing the breech could cause the 
weapon to fire.
 Inspection of the spur of the hammer (in guns with such features) in order 
to evaluate whether it may be prone to slipping from under the thumb of the 
shooter during uncocking.
9.3.4  Could the intentional discharge of this firearm 
have caused unintentional injury?
In court, it may be attested that, although the defendant deliberately discharged 
the firearm concerned, any injury or death that resulted was not intended as the 
weapon was aimed clear of the victim. There are indeed a number of circumstances 
in which this could occur. While in any given case it is up to the court to decide how 
credible such an explanation is and the importance that may be attached to it, the 
firearms examiner may be able to provide information that allows the credibility of 
such an argument to be properly assessed. For example, consider a case in which 
it is argued that a pistol was fired at the ground but that the force of the recoil 
caused the barrel of the gun to rise so that it was aligned with the victim’s chest, 
resulting in death or injury. This is not a likely explanation as not only does the 
bulk of the movement caused by recoil occur after the bullet has left the gun, but 
also pistols are commonly fitted with sights that are arranged so as to compensate 
for the effect of recoil when the weapon is used under normal circumstances. In 
any case, inspection of the weapon concerned will establish whether such a sighting 
arrangement is present and test firing will provide information on the effect of 
recoil on the direction of shooting.
 
Another category of this type of explanation warrants mention here, even though, 
in this instance, examination of the firearm itself cannot establish its credibility. 
This is that the death or injury was caused by a bullet that had ricocheted (i.e. 
been altered in its flight path by impact). However, as described in Section 9.2, the 
incidence of ricochet may be established by an examination of the scene and, in 
some instances, by the condition of the projectile.
9.3.5  Could this firearm have been used in the 
commission of an act of suicide?
During the investigation of a fatal shooting, it is crucially important to establish, if 
at all possible, whether it was as the result of suicide. This determination has to be 
made with great care not least because, in a given case, a murder may have been 
perpetrated but engineered so as to appear to have been suicide.

 
THE EXAMINATION OF SUSPECT FIREARMS  301
 
In order to establish that suicide has been committed, all the known 
circumstances of a given case will be taken into account. In firearms-related deaths 
that may be suicide, the weapon that fired the fatal shot will, almost without 
exception, be found at the scene, although recoil may have flung it clear of the 
body. Also, depending on the severity of the injuries sustained, it is possible that the 
fatally wounded victim may have moved the gun, and/or himself or herself, after the 
shooting. The role of firearms examination in cases of suspected suicide is explored 
further in Box 9.3.
In the case of a fatal shooting, the manner of death 
may be homicide, accident or suicide. It is imperative 
that, if at all possible, the investigation into each such 
shooting reveals which of these has occurred. Ultimately, 
in England and Wales, it is the role of the coroner to 
establish the manner of death (Chapter 12, Section 
12.4.2). However, in cases of fatal shooting, the firearms 
examiner can play an important part in helping the 
coroner to complete this task. He or she, often working 
in close conjunction with others involved in the case 
(e.g. the pathologist, fingerprints examiners, forensic 
biologists), may well be able to help to answer important 
questions. Key among these are those discussed below.
Is this firearm the one that fired the fatal shot?
In virtually every case of suicide by shooting, the 
weapon involved will be found at the scene. The 
same will be true of self-inflicted accidental fatal 
shootings. Therefore, in cases in which a weapon is 
not found at the scene, homicide or non-self-inflicted 
accident must be suspected. However, even in cases 
in which a weapon is located at the scene, this does 
not necessarily mean that suicide has occurred and it 
remains imperative to establish whether the weapon 
found was indeed the one which killed the victim.
 
The nature of the damage caused by the fatal 
discharge may enable certain weapons to be ruled 
out or deemed unlikely to have been responsible. For 
example, as a bullet passes through bone it will either 
shatter it or produce a hole, the dimensions of which 
may provide evidence of the calibre of the weapon 
involved (although great care needs to be exercised in 
the interpretation of such evidence). If the projectile(s) 
from this discharge are retained within the body, they 
can be recovered and may be compared with spent 
bullets or shotgun wadding (as appropriate) generated 
during the test-firing of the weapon (Section 9.4). If 
the wound contains unburned grains of propellant, 
these can be compared with any others recovered from 
the barrel of the gun and/or those obtained from any 
live cartridges taken from the scene. Also, any gunshot 
residues discovered on the victim can be compared with 
control samples taken from the inside of the gun and/
or the spent cartridge case that is believed to have 
been involved in the fatal shooting (Section 9.5).
 
The condition of the gun may also indicate whether it 
could have fired the fatal shot. For example, as described 
in Section 9.3.2, the presence of swarf in the inside of 
the barrel (or barrels, if it has two) of a sawn-off shotgun 
can indicate that it has not been fired since it was 
shortened. It follows therefore that if such a shotgun 
were found at the scene of an apparent suicide, it is 
most unlikely to have been the weapon responsible.
Is it probable that the victim shot himself or herself 
and, if so, was this act intentional or accidental?
Clearly, the firearms examiner cannot provide all of the 
evidence needed to answer these questions (e.g. he or 
she will not necessarily have knowledge of any possible 
motive for suicide). However, he or she may well be

reveal both class and individualising characteristics. Let us consider each of these 
types of item in turn.
9.4.1 The examination of spent cartridge cases
A spent cartridge case may carry a great deal of evidence. In the absence of a suspect 
firearm, it has the potential to reveal a number of important facts, including:
 the probable identity of the firm which made it (most cartridges carry 
identifying marks, referred to as headstamps, that are impressed onto the 
head by the manufacturer (e.g. see the photograph in Box 9.5));
 the identity of anyone who has handled it and left their fingerprints on it;
 the make and, in some cases, the model of firearm that discharged it.
able to provide key pieces of information and opinion. 
Importantly, the examiner will usually be able to give 
an indication of the range of the shot (Section 9.2). 
This information, when coupled with a knowledge of the 
distance from the muzzle to the trigger and the reach 
of the victim, will allow it to be established whether he 
or she could have pressed the trigger without the help 
of some device. If, in a given case, such a device was 
necessary and none was present, this is an extremely 
strong indication that death was not due to suicide 
but as a result of either accident or homicide. Also, as 
outlined in Section 9.3.3, the firearms examiner will be 
able to establish whether the gun concerned is prone 
to unintentional discharge.
 
Significantly, both suicide and accidental shootings 
that result in self-injury necessarily involve contact 
between the gun and the victim. Therefore, in such 
cases, it is quite possible that trace evidence, such 
as fingerprints and/or DNA, from the victim will 
be found on the gun and/or its ammunition. Also, 
except in cases involving air weapons (including gas-
powered guns), gunshot residues would be expected to 
be found. These would occur not only in and around 
the wound but also on the hand(s) of the victim. 
Furthermore, these would match residues recovered 
from the gun barrel and the spent cartridge case 
believed to have delivered the fatal shot.
 
It is worth noting that the pathologist, often working 
with the firearms examiner, will evaluate whether the site 
of the entrance wound is consistent with what is known 
about the sites on the body where suicides elect to shoot 
themselves. Common among such sites are the temples, 
forehead, mouth and the front portions of the neck and 
chest. The abdomen and eye are extremely rare targets 
for the act of suicide by shooting as are, for obvious 
reasons, locations that are difficult to reach (e.g. the 
back). Also, in many countries, including the UK, women 
are rarely victims of accidental or suicide shootings.
 
Finally, while it might appear to be improbable, 
many suicide victims shoot themselves repeatedly. 
Therefore, although multiple gunshot wounds would 
suggest homicide, this evidence alone is not enough to 
prove that it has occurred.

Importantly, if a suspect weapon is available, then a skilled firearms examiner will be 
able to establish whether the gun concerned did indeed fire the cartridge involved.
 
In order to maximise the information available from a spent cartridge case, the 
examiner will work methodically. If fingerprints are to be developed from the case, 
it is vitally important that this is done before they are smudged by subsequent 
handling. Once the case has been checked for the presence of fingerprints and any 
such prints have been recorded, then the examiner can note the calibre, shape and 
type of cartridge involved. For example, he or she will be able to readily establish 
whether the cartridge that was fired was one designed for use in a shotgun, 
handgun, rifle, etc.; whether it is rimmed or rimless; and whether it is centre-fire 
or rim-fire. On the basis of such information, it will often be possible to specify 
the class of weapon that is likely to have fired it. For example, a 12-bore shotgun 
cartridge may well have been fired in a shotgun and will not have been discharged in 
a conventional handgun. However obvious this type of connection may appear, it is 
important to realise that:
 some weapons are manufactured to be able to fire more than one type of 
ammunition (e.g. some revolvers are made such that they can fire both 
revolver and self-loading pistol ammunition);
 some types of ammunition can be fired in more than one type of weapon (e.g. 
sub-machine guns fire self-loading pistol cartridges);
 some weapons will fire ammunition of a type other than that intended for 
them (e.g. some self-loading pistols may fire certain revolver cartridges, 
although weapon malfunctions may occur);
 it is possible to adapt a gun to fire ammunition that, in its unaltered state, it 
cannot fire (e.g. the barrel of a shotgun can be exchanged to enable it to fire 
handgun cartridges) – such adaptations may be permanent or reversible; and
 desperate people will, on occasion, go to extraordinary lengths to enable 
the weapon at their disposal to fire the ammunition that they have to 
hand (e.g. by filing down oversized cartridges or by wrapping paper around 
undersized cartridges).
Information based on calibre, shape and type will be supplemented by class 
characteristics revealed in the marks left on the cartridge by the gun. For example, 
as described in Box 9.5, the actions of self-loading weapons usually create extractor, 
ejector and possibly chambering marks on cartridge cases, as do those of automatic 
weapons. The exact relative positions of such marks can be used to establish the 
probable make and, in some cases, model of the gun involved; as can, for example, 
the positions, shapes and sizes of firing pin marks.
 
In cases in which a suspect firearm is available, comparison macroscopy (Figure 
9.7) can be used to establish whether detailed features of the marks found on the 
questioned cartridge case match those created when a similar cartridge is test-
fired with the firearm concerned. These detailed features arise because of impact 
or abrasion between specific parts of both the gun and the cartridge (e.g. the firing 
pin of the gun and the primer cup of the cartridge). The exact pattern revealed in 
these detailed features will be a function of the shape and arrangement of grooves, 
pits and projections on the surface of the part of the gun involved. As the shape and 
arrangement of these attributes vary from gun to gun, a match is strong evidence 
that the questioned cartridge has, at some time, been in the gun concerned.

However, care does need to be exercised in drawing conclusions based on this 
evidence. For example, if a cartridge has been manually passed through the action 
of a self-loading weapon but not fired, the details on the extractor, ejector and 
chambering marks that it bears may well match those on a cartridge case that has 
been fired in the gun. Also, it is possible for a fired cartridge case to be reloaded 
with a fresh primer, propellant and bullet and reused. Under these circumstances, 
many of the marks present from the first firing of this cartridge case will be present 
after the second firing. In either case, the cartridge case concerned may bear the

marks of one gun after having been fired in a different weapon. Fortunately, there 
are marks that can be used to definitively link a spent cartridge case to the gun that 
fired it last, or on the only occasion that it has been fired. These are those caused 
by the firing pin and the face of the breech that appear on the primer cup. They can 
be used to make such a linkage because they are both individualising and are made 
only when the cartridge is fired (i.e. not merely passed through the gun’s action). 
Furthermore, the primer is replaced whenever a cartridge is reloaded.
9.4.2 The examination of fired bullets
Information on bullet design is provided in Box 9.4.
As described in Box 9.1, the term ‘bullets’ has several 
definitions. In this book, it is taken to mean those 
small-arms projectiles fired one at a time from the 
barrel of a gun.
 
Spherical bullets were (and are) used in smooth-
bore pistols and muskets. However, the advent of 
rifling allowed the introduction of elongated bullets: 
that is, those which are longer than they are wide. This 
is possible because the rifling causes the bullet to spin 
about its direction of travel, thereby keeping it flying 
nose first. This avoids the loss of accuracy that would 
accompany the end-over-end tumbling of the bullet, 
were this to occur. As a result of the aerodynamic 
superiority of a spin-stabilised elongated bullet over a 
spherical one, spherical bullets are rarely used today 
except in smooth-bore guns.
 
There are many shapes of elongated bullet currently 
in use. However, the most common bullets may be 
categorised as being:
 wadcutter: in essence this is a solid metal cylinder;
 semi-wadcutter: as above but with a flat-topped 
conical nose;
 round nose: a solid elongated bullet with a rounded tip;
 hollow-point: an elongated bullet with a conical, 
approximately conical or rounded nose that has a 
recess in its tip; or
 spitzer: these have a pointed nose.
 
The last of these is a shape that is common among 
rifle bullets but that is rarely, if ever, intended for 
use in handguns. Figure 9.9 shows images of spitzer, 
round-nose and semi-wadcutter bullets. 
 
Note that the spitzer bullet on the right of Figure 
9.9 has a tapered section towards the rear of the 
bullet. This feature reduces drag and is used in rifle 
bullets designed for long-range use. Bullets like this 
are known as streamlined bullets (UK terminology) or 
boat-tailed bullets (US terminology).
 
As can be seen from Figure 9.9, elongated 
bullets frequently have one or more grooves, called 
cannelures, in their flanks. These are used to house 
lubricant (in the case of many unjacketed lead bullets 
– see below) or to engage with the mouth of the 
cartridge case when it is crimped into place. The latter 
use allows a firm seal to be made between the case and 
the projectile.
 
Lead is commonly used in bullet manufacture. The 
principal advantages of this material in this context 
are its high density, its ready availability and the ease 
with which it can be formed into a desired shape.
 
Lead is soft. This means that it has the additional 
advantage that it can be made into bullets that will 
deform when fired so as to fill the rifling and make a 
gas-tight seal in the barrel. However, this also causes 
a problem when friction between the barrel and such 
a bullet causes metal to be transferred to the inside 
of the barrel. This phenomenon, referred to as leading, 
causes loss of accuracy and can ultimately close the 
bore so much that a bullet cannot pass through it.

The examination of a bullet recovered from a crime scene may provide evidence of 
what it has passed through and/or ricocheted off from the time that it left the muzzle 
of the gun to the moment at which it came to rest. Such evidence may be embodied 
in impressions made in the bullet of objects with which it has collided. For example, a 
bullet that has passed through or impacted on clothing may have the weave pattern of 
the material from which the clothing was made embossed in its nose (Figure 9.8).
 
To reduce this problem, the lead used to make the 
bullets can be hardened (by alloying it with antimony 
and/or tin) and/or the bullet can be lubricated. 
Lubrication can be achieved by use of a grease or by 
covering the bullet with a very thin film (known as a 
wash) of a suitable metal. However, the only method that 
entirely stops leading occurring is to encase the bullet in 
a suitable jacket. This means that unjacketed lead bullets 
are only suitable for ammunition that produces relatively 
low muzzle velocities. Also, the overwhelming majority of 
types of bullets that are now made have a core of lead or 
lead alloy and a jacket made of a harder material, most 
commonly a copper alloy. 
 
Jacketed bullets may be categorised depending on 
whether the core is exposed at the nose. Those with 
the nose exposed are said to be semi-jacketed or partial 
metal-jacketed. Those in which the jacket extends 
either over all of the outside of the bullet except its 
base or over the entirety of the bullet’s exterior are 
said to be full metal-jacketed. In some designs of semi-
jacketed bullet with a hollow point, the jacket extends 
some way into the recess at the bullet’s nose.
 
Semi-jacketed bullets typically deform on impact 
into a mushroom shape (see figures (a) and (b)). This 
process, known as expansion, aids the transfer of the 
bullet’s kinetic energy to the target, thereby increasing 
the amount of localised damage. It also lowers the 
probability of a bullet passing completely through a 
person’s body.
 
Clearly, both jacketed and unjacketed bullets are 
designed to engage with the barrel’s rifling. Lead, 
lead alloy and the materials from which bullet jackets 
are made are all softer than the metal from which the 
barrel is formed. This means that, provided that they are 
not undersized, bullets will pick up marks made by the 
rifling in the barrel and this will happen whether or not 
they are jacketed. As detailed in Section 9.4.2, these 
marks have significant evidential value. Lead and lead 
alloy bullets are likely to deform sufficiently on firing to 
completely fit the rifling. This means that impressions 
of both the lands and the grooves will be made on the 
bullet’s flanks. However, jacketed bullets, as they are 
less prone to deformation, do not fully occupy the rifling 
and so exhibit little, if any, information from inside the 
barrel’s grooves. Lead and lead alloy bullets are more 
prone to damage on impact and oxidation afterwards 
than are those with full metal-jackets. Such damage and 
corrosion can significantly reduce the amount of useful 
information that can be obtained from the rifling marks 
made on bullets. In a similar vein, the fine detail of 
rifling marks may be lost from lead or lead alloy bullets 
that are coated in a thin wash of metal as this wash is 
prone to becoming detached from the bullet. 
 
Finally, it must be noted that there is enormous 
variety in bullet design and there is a large range 
of specialist projectiles in use. For example, there 
are bullets that are designed to explode on impact, 
those which deliver poison, frangible bullets that are 
designed to disintegrate when they strike an object 
and bullets designed to be fired from shotguns. A 
bullet that falls into the last of these categories may 
be a sphere or a projectile, known as a rifled slug, that 
is designed to be stabilised in flight.

However, it may also take the form of items of trace evidence either on the bullet’s 
surface or embedded into it. For example, such items may include traces of:
 garment fibres, blood, bone and/or hair (as may occur in the case of a bullet 
that has passed through a victim);
 wood, glass and/or paint (as may be found if the bullet had struck a wooden 
door or window);
 brick, sand and/or cement (as could be seen if it had hit a wall).
 
Clearly, as such trace evidence may be easily lost, it is wise to look for it before 
any other aspect of the bullet is examined.
 
A bullet that has suffered little damage will reveal the calibre of its cartridge, as 
this is evident from the bullet’s shape and dimensions. In the case of a damaged 
but intact bullet, its weight will give an indication of its calibre and allow certain 
calibres to be excluded as possibilities.
 
A knowledge of the calibre of the cartridge, coupled with an observation of the 
overall features of rifling marks present on the bullet, can enable a skilled firearms 
examiner to narrow down the types of gun that could have fired the cartridge 
concerned. The features of the rifling marks that may be used in such an assessment 
include the number of land impressions, and their direction of twist (i.e. right-hand 
or left-hand – see Figure 9.9), width and angle of inclination. However, some care 
needs to be taken in this work. For example, in many cases, it is quite possible 
to fire ammunition of an incorrect calibre in a given gun – although in instances 
where the bullet is recovered in a fairly undamaged state, such an occurrence will 
normally be evident from the state or lack of the rifling marks engraved upon it. 
Furthermore, it is quite possible that the firearm that discharged the cartridge had 
been altered in some way (e.g. re-chambered or re-rifled) so that the calibre and/or 
rifling marks are not those expected.

In cases in which both a questioned bullet and a suspect firearm have been 
recovered, it is often possible to establish whether the gun concerned did indeed fire 
the questioned bullet. Firstly, the gun’s calibre and the class characteristics of its 
rifling are compared with those established from the bullet. If these are consistent 
with the bullet having been fired by the gun, then comparison macroscopy (Figure 9.7) 
is used to compare the rifling marks on the questioned bullet with those on similar 
bullets that have been test-fired using the weapon concerned. In this case, the features 
that are compared are the minute parallel lines (i.e. striations) that form on the 
relatively soft bullet as it passes down the barrel. The features of the barrel that cause 
these lines are those imperfections in the barrel’s internal surface that were introduced

shapes and the bottom two may be classified as semi-wadcutters. Information on bullet 
design is provided in Box 9.4.

during manufacture, or caused by the abrasive action of previous bullets or cleaning 
activities, or introduced by corrosion. The striations that a given barrel produces are 
believed to be unique to it; that is, such marks are individualising. Therefore, matches 
between the striations that are found on the questioned bullet with those found on the 
test bullet can conclusively demonstrate that the same gun fired both bullets.
 
However, there are reasons why the striations on two bullets fired by the same 
gun may not match. A number of these are considered below:
 The striations alter as the gun is used and the barrel wears. However, these 
alterations due to wear are rarely significant except in automatic weapons 
and firearms constructed from inferior materials.
 If the weapon is recovered in a rusty state, the corrosion products on the 
inside of the barrel may cause the striations it makes to differ from those 
formed by the previously clean gun. 
 If the barrel has been damaged in an attempt to thwart the forensic linking 
of the bullet to the gun, this may alter the striations that it produces.
 The barrel of the gun may have been replaced since the questioned bullet was 
fired (the barrels of many self-loading pistols are readily changed).
Therefore, when interpreting evidence based on the match, or otherwise, between 
questioned and test-fired bullets, it may be possible to state that the gun under 
examination:
 fired both bullets, that is the class characteristics (calibre and the large-scale 
features of the rifling marks) show that it is possible for the gun to have fired 
both bullets and the striations on one bullet match those on the other;
 may have fired both bullets, that is the class characteristics (calibre and the 
large-scale features of the rifling marks) show that it is possible for the gun 
to have fired both bullets but the striations on one bullet do not match those 
on the other; or 
 at least in its current form could not have fired both bullets, that is the class 
characteristics (calibre and the large-scale features of the rifling marks) do 
not match.
Finally, while air weapons do not fire cartridges, the projectiles that they discharge 
will often carry directly analogous information to that of bullets fired from other 
types of gun. Like such bullets, lead pellets shot from air weapons will normally carry 
rifling impressions on their flanks that can provide both class and individualising 
characteristics. Similarly, these pellets can provide information about the calibre 
of the weapon from which they were discharged and they may bear marks or trace 
materials that reveal details of objects with which they have impacted.
9.4.3 The examination of shotgun plastic cup wads
Figure 9.2e shows an illustration of a modern shotgun cartridge containing a plastic 
cup wad. When a shotgun is fired, the wadding leaves the muzzle of the weapon with 
the pellets and travels some distance in the general direction of travel of the shot. 
Plastic cup wads are used in many modern shotgun cartridges and may therefore be 
recovered from the scene of a crime in which a shotgun was discharged.

 
 310  FIREARMS
 
There are a large number of designs of plastic cup wad in use, a fact that can 
help in the identification of the brand of cartridge from which a given wad was fired. 
However, although the details of the design of such wads vary, they are all essentially 
two cups joined back to back. One cup contains the shot and the other acts as a cap 
over the propellant.
 
The diameter of the wad indicates the bore of the weapon designed to fire the 
cartridge that contained the wad. Furthermore, the surface of the plastic cup wad 
that faces the shot can hold indentations that give an indication of the size of the 
pellets that were fired.
 
The high muzzle pressures that are generated in sawn-off shotguns can mean that 
the cup-shaped portion of the wad that faces the propellant in the live cartridge is 
turned inside out on firing. The presence of this feature can therefore indicate that 
such a weapon was used. Additionally, when a sawn-off shotgun is created, inept 
workmanship may mean that burs of metal are left on the inside of the barrel. These 
can leave individualising marks on plastic cup wads that are fired from the gun 
concerned.
Within a fraction of a second of firing, the action 
of a self-loading gun will have removed the spent 
cartridge case from the weapon and, provided that the 
magazine was not empty at the time of firing, placed 
a live cartridge in the chamber. The firing mechanism 
will also have been re-cocked. The energy required to 
undertake these processes is obtained from the firing 
of the gun in the first instance. The shooter may then 
fire the weapon again by re-pulling the trigger.
 
Pulling the trigger causes the firing pin of the 
weapon to be forced into the metal primer cup, where it 
leaves an impression of its tip. Immediately after this, 
the process of firing makes the cartridge case expand 
and may thereby result in the formation of marks on its 
sides due to voids or imperfections within the chamber. 
Importantly, firing also forces the case backwards into 
the face of the breech. In most cases, this results in 
the creation of an impression of the breech face on the 
primer cup and, normally, elsewhere on the head of the 
cartridge case.
 
Once the gas pressure within the barrel has dropped 
to a safe level, the breech will be made to open by the 
action of the weapon. In some cases, this causes the tip 
of the firing pin to be pulled slightly across the primer 
cup, leading to the formation of a drag mark (see figure 
(a) below).
 
In the majority of self-loading weapons, the spent 
cartridge case is pulled from the chamber by an 
extractor claw engaged in the case’s extractor groove 
(Figure 9.2d). As the empty case travels towards the rear 
of the gun, it is made to strike an ejector rod, which is 
positioned so as to cause the case to be flung out of 
the weapon via the gun’s ejection port. Note that if the 
firing pin is still protruding into the primer cup at the 
time of ejection, this too can cause a drag mark to be 
formed similar to that shown in figure (a). Immediately 
after the ejection of the empty case, the action picks 
up a live cartridge (if present) from the magazine and 
pushes it into the chamber. These processes typically 
result in the formation of marks on the flanks of the 
case made when the cartridge was pushed into the 
chamber (known as chambering marks), and where the 
extractor claw engaged in the extractor groove and 
the cartridge head struck the ejector rod. The general 
locations of these marks are shown in figure (b) below.
 
There are other ways in which a self-loading gun 
can mark cartridge cases. For example:

GUNSHOT RESIDUES  311
9.5 Gunshot residues
The discharge of a firearm results in not only the ejection of the intended 
projectile(s) but also secondary ejecta. These secondary materials include partially 
combusted and unburned propellant, the combustion products of both the 
propellant and the primer, and matter derived from the barrel, cartridge case and 
projectile(s). When a gun is fired, these materials form a heterogeneous cloud of 
finely divided particles, known collectively as gunshot residues (GSRs), firearms 
discharge residues (FDRs) or cartridge discharge residues (CDRs). These residues 
settle on all nearby surfaces. These include the insides of the barrel and cartridge; 
where exposed, the hand(s), clothes, hair and face of the shooter; and the target 
(provided that it was sufficiently close to the firearm when it was fired).
 
As illustrated by the Barry George case (Box 9.6), evidence based on gunshot 
residues can form a pivotal part of court cases.
 to warn the shooter of the gun’s condition, Walther 
PPK pistols have a pin that protrudes from the 
weapon when a cartridge is in the chamber – the 
presence of this pin causes an indentation to 
appear in the head of spent cartridge cases;
 guns fitted with box magazines may produce marks 
on the flanks of the cartridge cases that they use 
because of the abrasion that occurs between each 
cartridge case and the lips of the magazine when the 
action of the gun withdraws a live cartridge from it;
 in some weapons, the cartridge cases can glance 
off the edge of the ejection port as they leave – so 
producing marks on the flanks of the spent cases of 
fired cartridges.

On 26 April 1999, the UK television presenter Jill 
Dando was shot on the doorstep of her home in 
Fulham, southwest London, at approximately 11.30 
a.m. and certified dead just after 1 p.m. at nearby 
Charing Cross Hospital. The next day, Scotland Yard 
announced that she had been killed by a single shot to 
the side of her head, fired at close range. One theory 
concerning the motive for this murder, and one that 
gained weight as the massive police investigation 
progressed, was that the killer could be a fan who was 
obsessed with Miss Dando. Rewards totalling a quarter 
of a million pounds were offered (from two newspapers 
and a private individual) and appeals for information 
were staged by the television programme Crimewatch in 
May 1999 and April 2000. 
 
The murder weapon was never found, although a 
spent cartridge case was recovered from the scene of 
the murder. The examination of this cartridge case by 
a firearms expert indicated that the gun used was a 
short, self-loading 9 mm pistol. Marks present on the 
bullet showed that it had been fired from a gun with 
a smooth-bored barrel and not from a rifled barrel, 
as would be expected with a conventional pistol. A 
possible explanation for this anomaly was that the gun 
used was a deactivated* gun that had subsequently 
been reactivated. 
 
Thirteen months after Miss Dando’s murder, a 
41-year-old man called Barry George (also known 
as Barry Bulsara) from the Fulham area was arrested 
by police. Four days later, on 29 May 2000, he was 
charged with the murder of Miss Dando at West London 
Magistrates’ Court. Almost a year later, on 4 May 2001, 
the trial of Barry George at the Old Bailey finally got 
under way after a number of adjournments. Eight 
weeks later, after a period of deliberation lasting over 
30 hours, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, by a 
majority of 10 to 1. Barry George was sentenced to life 
imprisonment on 2 July 2001. When the verdict was 
returned, his defence team immediately announced 
their intention to appeal. 
 
An important part of the prosecution’s case 
concerned trace evidence in the form of gunshot 
residue. This is also known as firearm discharge 
residue (FDR). A microscopic particle of this material 
(approximately 11 μm in size) was recovered from 
the pocket of a coat belonging to Barry George. 
According to a firearms examiner from the Forensic 
Science Service (FSS) called to appear in court as an 
expert witness, this could have originated from the 
fired cartridge case recovered from the crime scene. 
Considerable consideration was given during the trial 
as to whether this particle could have arrived where 
it was found by innocent means. The following extract 
from the trial judge’s summing up indicates the 
significance of this particle to the prosecution’s case:
What you have to do is to decide whether, on the 
evidence to which I have referred, the prosecution 
has made you sure that this particle was deposited 
on the coat other than innocently. If you are sure 
you can exclude innocent contamination, then you 
can take this matter into account, along with all 
the other evidence, when deciding whether the 
prosecution has proved its case. If you are not 
sure that the prosecution has proved its case on 
this issue, then discard this evidence altogether; 
it will not help you at all. In that event, you may 
think – as I have already said towards the start of 
my summing-up – this removes an important part 
of the Crown’s case.
 
Aside from the matter of the gunshot residue described 
above, the prosecution’s case was composed mainly of 
circumstantial evidence, including that of eyewitnesses. 
An appeal by Barry George against his conviction was 
dismissed on 29 July 2002. Later that same year, in 
December 2002, permission to take his appeal to a higher 
court was turned down by the House of Lords. 
 
On 20 June 2007, acting on new evidence relating 
to the above-mentioned gunshot residue evidence, the

GUNSHOT RESIDUES  313
 
A number of techniques have been devised to analyse for the presence of gunshot 
residues. These are based on the detection (and in some cases the quantification) of 
either:
 the organic fraction, which is dominated by the materials derived from the 
propellant; or
George’s murder conviction to the Criminal Division of 
the Court of Appeal (Chapter 14, Section 14.1.3). The 
new evidence centred on the assessment of the probative 
value of the gunshot residue evidence. Importantly, on 
19 January 2006, the FSS introduced guidance on how 
its scientists should report on evidence consisting of 
low levels of gunshot residue, including single particles. 
In that guidance, the FSS stated that, because of 
insufficient data about the environmental prevalence of 
gunshot residue, it was adopting a cautious approach 
and would not be offering an evidential value when 
reporting on low levels of such residues. 
 
At the request of the CCRC, the FSS reappraised 
the gunshot residue evidence that was presented at 
Barry George’s trial. In the multi-page report that this 
produced, the authors wrote:
We are satisfied that a particle found on the sample 
taken from the inside right pocket of Mr George’s 
coat was characteristic of firearms discharge resi-
due. The particle is indistinguishable from some of 
those produced by the round of ammunition used to 
shoot Ms Dando, but a high proportion of ammuni-
tion can produce such particles.
And:
Conclusion
The significance of the FDR findings in this case can 
be put into context by considering two alternative 
propositions:
Mr George is the man who shot Ms Dando.
Mr George had nothing to do with the incident.
In our opinion the probability of finding a single 
particle of discharge residue in Mr George’s coat 
pocket would have been the same, regardless of 
which of the above propositions was true.
The FDR evidence is thus inconclusive. In our 
opinion it provides no assistance to anyone asked 
to judge which proposition is true.
 
While expressed without the use of mathematical 
symbols, the conclusion quoted above makes use of a 
likelihood ratio in the evaluation of the evidence. The use 
of such ratios is explored in Chapter 13, Section 13.6. 
 
In a judgment** dated 15 November 2007, the 
Court of Appeal quoted the above-mentioned report 
and quashed the conviction of Barry George (the 
appellant). The following is a direct quote of the final 
paragraph of that judgment:
It is impossible to know what weight, if any, the 
jury attached to the FDR evidence. It is equally 
impossible to know what verdict they would have 
reached had they been told as we were told, by the 
witnesses who gave evidence before us, that it was 
just as likely that the single particle of FDR came 
from some extraneous source as it was that it came 
from a gun fired by the appellant. The verdict is 
unsafe. The conviction will be quashed.
A retrial was ordered and, on 1 August 2008, Barry 
George was found not guilty of the murder of Jill 
Dando.
*In the wake of the Dunblane School shootings of 1996, legislation 
was introduced that effectively outlawed the possession of handguns. 
However, these could still be legally owned, for example as collectors’ 
items, if they had the necessary official certification to show that they 
had been rendered incapable of firing projectiles.

 the inorganic fraction, which is made up of materials formed from the 
combustion products of the primer and metals from the cartridge case, 
barrel and bullet.
To date, the most successful of these techniques is the application of SEM–EDX 
(Box 9.7), which concentrates on the inorganic fraction. This technique not only 
allows much of the elemental composition of individual microscopic particles to 
be established, but also enables images that show their morphology (i.e. shape) 
to be obtained. This is important because, in many cases, knowledge of these two 
attributes will allow gunshot residue particles to be uniquely identified as such and 
the discovery of these particles on a suspect may therefore be incriminating. In 
other cases, particles will be either identified as possibly being gunshot residues or 
shown not to have arisen from the firing of a gun.
SEM compared with light microscopy
SEM is a technique that uses a beam of electrons to 
produce magnified images of samples. It has three main 
advantages over microscopy that uses light to carry out 
this function. Firstly, SEM can produce images with a 
much higher degree of spatial resolution than can light 
microscopy. Spatial resolution is a measure of the ability 
to tell apart features that are physically close together. 
SEM is capable of distinguishing between adjacent 
features that are only 4 nm apart. That is, SEM is capable 
of a spatial resolution of 4 nm. This compares extremely 
favourably with the best spatial resolution that can be 
obtained by light microscopy, which is 200 nm. 
 
Secondly, SEM has a much greater depth of field, 
especially at high levels of magnification, than does 
light microscopy. Depth of field is an expression of the  
distance along the path taken by the beam that impacts 
with the sample either side of the ideal focal point of 
that beam that still produces an image with an acceptable 
level of spatial resolution. Taken together, these first 
two points mean that SEM is much better than light 
microscopy at producing images of the surfaces of three-
dimensional objects at high levels of magnification.
 
The third main advantage of SEM is its ability – when 
coupled with a technique known as energy dispersive 
X-ray analysis (EDX) (described below) – to provide 
information about the elemental composition of a sample 
and the spatial distribution of the elements within it. 
This is something that light microscopy cannot do.
 
It is important to realise, however, that light 
microscopy has advantages over SEM. For example, 
SEM cannot provide information about refractive index, 
bi-refringence (Chapter 3, Box 3.3) or colour. For many 
applications, therefore, SEM and light microscopy are 
complementary techniques.
The generation of SEM images and the nature of EDX
A scanning electron microscope consists of:

narrow beam (called the primary beam);

portion of the surface of the sample in a series of

the sample’s surface;

GUNSHOT RESIDUES  315
Figure 9.10 is the result of an SEM–EDX analysis of a particle of gunshot residue. Note 
that it has the spheroidal (ball-like) morphology that is typical of most such particles. 
Note also that this example contains lead (Pb, which may be from the primer or the 
bullet), and barium (Ba), antimony (Sb) and potassium (K) (from the primer). Other 
typical elements that may be found in particles of gunshot residue from modern 
cartridges are calcium and silicon (from the primer), copper and zinc (from the 
cartridge case) and iron (from the barrel). As mentioned before, gunshot residues are 
heterogeneous. Consequently, the particles in a given sample will not necessarily share 
parallel lines that thereby form a rectangular image 
of a scanned portion of the sample’s surface.
When the primary beam of electrons hits the sample’s 
surface, the energy that it imparts to that surface is 
dissipated by a number of processes. Importantly, these 
include the ejection of both secondary and back-scattered 
electrons, and the production of characteristic X-rays. 
Each of these phenomena produces a signal that can be 
used to generate an image of the surface of the sample.
 
Secondary electrons (SE) are those that are ejected 
from the atoms of the sample during interactions with 
the primary beam of electrons. Secondary electrons are 
not highly energetic and so can only escape from those 
regions of the sample that are very near to the surface. 
For this reason, and because the area from which these 
electrons emanate is essentially the same as the area 
irradiated by the primary beam, secondary electrons 
provide the images with the best spatial resolution. 
These images are also readily interpreted to give 
information about the surface topography of the sample. 
This is because protruding parts of its surface appear as 
bright areas, while indented areas are dark – just as they 
would appear if the sample were illuminated with light.
 
Back-scattered electrons (BSE) arise when 
the electrons of the primary beam rebound after 
interactions with the nuclei of the atoms that make 
up the sample. BSE are typically much more energetic 
than secondary electrons and therefore can originate 
from deeper within the sample and produce images that 
show poorer spatial resolution. The interactions that 
produce the BSE are strongly influenced by the sizes 
of the charge on the nuclei of the atoms involved. The 
atomic number of a nucleus is equal to the number 
of positively charged particles that it contains. 
Consequently, the BSE image of a flat surface is brighter 
in those areas that represent parts of the sample with 
a relatively high average atomic number (i.e. high 
average nuclear charge) than those that correspond 
to regions of low average atomic number (i.e. low 
average nuclear charge). As all atoms that have the 
same atomic number are atoms of the same element, 
the BSE image conveys some, albeit highly qualitative, 
information about the elemental composition of the 
sample. If the sample is not flat, the BSE image is 
harder to interpret because, in addition to information 
about the elemental composition of the sample, it 
also exhibits changes in brightness with variations in 
surface topography. 
 
The bombardment of a sample with the primary 
electron beam will induce it to produce characteristic 
X-ray photons (a photon is a particle of electromagnetic 
radiation). Each such photon is released from the 
sample as a consequence of the ejection of an electron 
from an inner shell of an atom. This happens within the 
sample as a result of interactions between the atoms 
concerned and electrons from the primary beam. An 
ejection such as this leaves a gap in the inner shell 
involved. If this gap is filled by an electron from 
an outer shell of the same atom, an X-ray photon is 
released with an energy that is characteristic of the 
atomic number of the atom. This means that an analysis 
of the energy of the photons released by this process 
can be used to establish the elemental composition of 
that part of the sample that is immediately under the 
portion of its surface that is radiated with the primary 
electron beam. Alternatively, the system used to detect 
these photons can be tuned to the energy of one of 
the characteristic X-rays of an element of interest. This 
enables an image of the distribution of this element 
in the surface portion of the sample that is irradiated 
with the primary beam to be established. Such images, 
which are usually referred to as maps, do not have the 
spatial resolution of SE or BSE images.

exactly the same elemental composition. However, the elements that they do contain 
will represent those derived from the cartridge that was fired and the gun that fired 
it. Interestingly, there are a number of different primer compositions in use. It may 
therefore be possible to distinguish between cartridges on the basis of the elemental 
composition of the gunshot residues that they produce.
 
Gunshot residues can be recovered from the surfaces on which they have alighted 
using a number of techniques. These include the application of an aluminium stub

advantage that the stub and tab can be directly placed into the SEM-EDX machine 
without further sample pre-treatment.
 
In addition to analysing for the inorganic part of gunshot residues, it is common 
practice to determine whether there are also organic materials present that are 
consistent with the discharge of a firearm. Some laboratories routinely carry out 
such analysis for organic compounds, while others do so only if the analysis for 
inorganic materials produces a positive result. Sampling for the organic fraction is 
conveniently carried out by using a vacuum to draw air from over the surface to be 
analysed and thence onto a suitable filter.

of the Firearms Act 1968 (as currently amended), is ‘a 
lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any 
shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged …’. The 
categories of non-air weapon firearms most commonly 
encountered by forensic examiners are handguns, 
shotguns, rifles and sub-machine guns. Of these, the first 
is of particular importance as they are the most common

Problems
1. During a fatal shooting incident, three shots were fired: two from one 
gun and one from another. However, only one bullet struck the deceased. 
Furthermore, this bullet passed right through the victim. All three spent 
cartridge cases and all three bullets were recovered from the scene, as were 
both of the guns. Would it be possible to establish which gun had fired the 
fatal shot?
2. When confronted with evidence that she fired a fatal shot, a suspect in 
a homicide case admitted to firing the gun but asserted that the gun was 
accidentally discharged and that, in any case, it was not pointing at the 
victim when it was fired. Under ideal circumstances, what types of evidence 
could the firearms examiner produce that would corroborate or refute the 
suspect’s assertion?
3. If you were to be asked to design the firearms examination provision for a major 
supplier of forensic science services, what advantages and disadvantages would 
you see in building one laboratory compared with two separate laboratories? In 
the latter case, one laboratory would only carry out gunshot residue analysis, 
whereas the other would be restricted to the examination of suspect firearms 
and spent cartridge cases, bullets, wads and shot.
4. Consider two bullets fired from the same gun, using identical cartridges from 
exactly the same place, in precisely the same direction, through the canopy of a 
tree in quick succession under identical conditions. The first bullet ricocheted 
off a twig. This caused the bullet to deviate by 1° from its original path. It also 
broke the twig clear of its branch so that the second bullet hit no part of the 
tree. How far apart would the impact sites of the two bullets be? Assume that 
 Ballistics is the scientific study of projectile motion. When 
considering small arms, distinction is drawn between 
internal ballistics (concerned with projectile motion within 
the barrel), external ballistics (concerned with the flight 
of the projectile after it leaves the firearm) and terminal 
ballistics (the study of the interaction of the projectile 
with the target). Knowledge of ballistics, often linked with 
the test-firing of the suspect weapon, can help in crime 
scene reconstruction by providing information about, for 
example, the range of fire and the likelihood of ricochet.
 The examination of a suspect firearm will often provide 
the answers to important questions. These may include:
– With whom or what has this firearm been in contact?
– Could this firearm be responsible for firing the shots 
that were discharged at a given shooting incident?
– Could this firearm have been unintentionally 
discharged?
– Could the intentional discharge of this firearm have 
caused unintentional injury?
 
In cases of fatal shootings, it also has an important role to 
play in the establishment of the manner of death whether 
homicide, accident or suicide.
 The examination of any given spent cartridge case has 
the potential to establish the identity of anyone who has 
handled it and left their fingerprints on it and the weapon 
that fired it. Similarly, the marks left on a bullet when 
discharged from a gun can, in many cases, be used to 
uniquely match it to the weapon concerned. A spent bullet 
may also reveal evidence of what it passed through and/
or ricocheted off from the time it left the muzzle of the 
gun to the moment at which it came to rest. Plastic cup 
wads fired from sawn-off shotguns along with the charge of 
pellets may also carry individualising marks that enable the 
gun concerned to be unambiguously identified.

normally settle on his or her hands, face, hair and clothes. 
These residues can be recovered after the event and, in 
some cases, be clearly identified as having been generated 
when a gun was fired. Under favourable circumstances, 
the gunshot residues from different cartridges may be 
distinguished on the basis of their elemental composition.

 
the target is, to a good approximation, at right angles to the flight-path of both 
bullets and that it is 50 metres from the twig in question.

(a) finding gunshot residues on someone’s hand; and 
(b) finding someone’s fingerprints on a spent cartridge case.

Introduction
Throughout the populated world, fire causes considerable damage, loss of life and 
human misery. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of this destruction and distress 
results from deliberately ignited fires. For example, in 2007, 384 600 fires were 
attended by local authority fire brigades in the UK, of which there were 62 500 fires 
(i.e. approximately 16 per cent of the total) that were deliberately started. 
 
In this chapter, the nature of fire is described (Section 10.1), as is its behaviour 
in both rooms and similar compartments, and outdoors (Section 10.2). The means 
by which fire scenes are investigated are discussed (Section 10.3) and the laboratory 
analysis of samples for materials that might have been used by an arsonist in an 
attempt to accelerate the spread of fire is explored (Section 10.4).

10.1 The nature of fire
Fire is that condition, characterised by the evolution of heat and light, that occurs 
as a consequence of a chemical process known as combustion. Combustion is an 
exothermic (i.e. heat-evolving) redox reaction. Redox reactions are those that 
involve the complete transfer of electrons from one chemical species to another. 
The chemical species that loses electrons is referred to as the reductant or reducing 
agent, whereas the species that gains them is known as the oxidant or oxidising 
agent. In combustion reactions, the reductant is referred to as the fuel. 
 
In the vast majority of fires, the oxidant is the molecular oxygen (O2(g)) that 
makes up 20.95 per cent by volume of dry, normal air at sea level. Such fires 
are referred to in this book as conventional fires. In contrast, under unusual 
circumstances, other oxidants may be involved. For example, fires involving 
fireworks will be sustained, at least in part, by the oxidising agents (such as the 
nitrate ion, NO3
–) present within the formulations of the contents of the fireworks 
themselves.
 
There are four conditions that must be met in order for a fire to start and to be 
self-sustaining. Two of these have already been mentioned. These are the presence of 
both a fuel and an appropriate oxidant, which must be brought together in suitable 
proportions. In addition, sufficient, suitable energy must be supplied (usually as 
heat) for the ignition of the fire. Once a self-sustaining fire has started, the heat 
that it generates is more than enough for this purpose, thereby allowing continuous 
reignition to occur. Finally, the fuel and oxidant must have the ability to react in 
a chain reaction that is self-sustaining. The absence of any one of these conditions 
means that a fire will not start. Furthermore, removal of one or more of them will 
put out an established fire. This is the basis of all fire-fighting techniques.
 
Distinction can be made between fires that have flames (i.e. plumes of burning 
gas) and fires that smoulder (i.e. produce heat and light without the presence 
of flames). In conventional fires, the flammable gas necessary for the presence 
of flames may arise from the pyrolysis (i.e. the chemical breakdown under the 
influence of heat) of a solid fuel, such as wood or coal. Alternatively, it may be 
present as the result of the vaporisation of a liquid fuel, such as petrol, or the fuel 
itself may be a gas, such as methane (the dominant component of natural gas).
 
Smouldering can take place when solid fuels burn. This mode of combustion is 
frequently observed in conventional fires and, when it occurs, takes place at the 
interface between the solid fuel and the air. Many organic solid fuels (i.e. solid fuels 
based on carbon compounds), including wood, pyrolyse in conventional fires to 
produce not only flammable gases but also a char. In many instances, this char – 
which is impure carbon – remains after the gaseous pyrolysis products have ceased 
to form and undergoes smouldering combustion.
 
Well-ventilated char that is undergoing smouldering combustion, and which 
may be very hot, can produce small flames that are mainly due to the gaseous 
combustion of carbon monoxide (CO). Notwithstanding this, completely pyrolysed 
smouldering char will not support the full flaming combustion frequently observed 
during the char-producing pyrolysis process, unless fresh fuel is supplied to the fire.
 
Smouldering can also arise in solid fuels that are still capable of forming flam-
mable gases by pyrolysis. This can occur if the ventilation and/or the heat supply 
is insufficient to support flaming combustion. If such a fire is allowed to spread, it

may become sufficiently hot and ventilated to allow flaming combustion to ensue 
(i.e. the fire may burst into flames). In the normal course of events, the flaming fire 
will then spread at a much faster rate than the preceding smouldering combustion.
 
Unusually, a conventional fire may be preceded by an explosion or explosions. 
This may occur because of the deliberate or accidental discharge of an explosive 
device. It may also occur when a mixture of air and a flammable gas (e.g. natural 
gas), dust (e.g. flour or coal dust) or vapour (e.g. petrol vapour) is ignited. For 
example, an arsonist who douses the inside of a property with petrol prior to setting 
it alight may well blow him- or herself up when striking the match. As shown in 
Chapter 11, Figure 11.1, flammable vapour explosions can be highly destructive.
 
On occasion, an explosion or explosions may accompany a conventional fire. This 
can happen if, during the course of a fire, a container of flammable liquid or gas 
is heated. This will cause the pressure in the container to rise and, if it bursts, a 
cloud of flammable gas or rapidly vaporising flammable liquid may be discharged 
into the vicinity of the fire. An explosion will then occur if the gas or vapour mixes 
with sufficient oxygen from the air and is then set alight, most commonly by the 
fire. Also, there are circumstances in which smouldering combustion occurring 
within a vigorous fire can lead to flaming combustion that spreads with sufficient 
rapidity to cause an explosion. This can happen if solid fuel that is capable of 
sustaining flaming combustion is made to smoulder because the fire is held within a 
compartment, such as a room, that is poorly ventilated. Under these circumstances, 
the fuel will pyrolyse and the concentration of flammable gaseous pyrolysis products 
will rise within the compartment. If the compartment is then breached by, for 
example, a fire-fighter breaking a window, the sudden ingress of fresh air may fulfil 
the remaining condition for intense flaming combustion, namely the presence of an 
oxidant in sufficient amounts. If this occurs, an explosion can result that is variously 
known as a smoke explosion, flashback, backdraft or ventilation-induced flashover. 
 
The nature of explosives and explosions, and the means by which explosion scenes 
may be investigated, are discussed in Chapter 11.
10.2 The behaviour of fire
10.2.1  Fires in rooms and similar compartments
If allowed to burn unhindered, a fire taking place in a room that has a typical fuel 
load will, in most cases, proceed in a fairly predictable fashion, although the time 
taken from the start of a room fire to its end may vary significantly from one such 
incident to another. For ease of understanding, it is possible to divide the sequence 
of events that occurs in a room fire into a number of stages: namely, ignition, 
growth, flashover, post-flashover steady-state burning (also referred to as a fully 
developed fire) and decay. The last of these stages ends when the fire stops burning. 
As shown in Figure 10.1, once ignition has occurred, the heat release rate of a given 
room fire (which is the power transmitted out of the fire as heat) typically follows a 
pattern of increase, plateau and decline. These three phases correspond to growth 
culminating in flashover, post-flashover steady-state burning and decay respectively.

thE bEhAvioUR of fiRE n 323
Each of the stages of a typical room fire listed in this paragraph are considered in 
turn below.
Ignition
Ignition occurs when all four of the conditions that are required for a fire to start 
– as set out in Section 10.1 – occur simultaneously in the same place. The newly 
ignited fire may produce flames from the start. However, even in fuels that are 
capable of sustaining flaming combustion, the fire may smoulder at the outset, 
bursting into flames only once the heat release rate and ventilation are adequate for 
it to do so. Indeed, some smouldering fires never reach these conditions and so do 
not burst into flames, and do not proceed through the sequence of events described 
here but smoulder until they self-extinguish.
 
In the vast majority of conventional fires, whether flaming or smouldering, ignition 
happens when heat supplies energy at a sufficient rate to a suitable fuel that is already 
in contact with the oxygen in the air. The heat that ignites the fire may be liberated 
by a number of processes. The most notable of these are listed below:
n Friction, as is the case when the head of a ‘strike anywhere’ match is rubbed 
against a suitably rough surface or when a mechanical bearing overheats due 
to insufficient lubrication.

n Electrical heating, as occurs when an electric current passes through 
a resistor. All normal materials through which electricity passes offer 
some resistance1 and so will produce heat. The standard electrical wiring 
systems used to supply electricity to households, industry and commerce 
are no exception to this. However, they are designed such that, when 
they are installed and used correctly, the rate at which they produce heat 
is sufficiently low that it will be safely dissipated. There are nevertheless 
Spontaneous combustion
there are a number of fuels that, under certain 
circumstances, are known to ignite without the 
application of an external source of energy. in other 
words, they undergo spontaneous combustion. such 
fires start when exothermic (i.e. heat-releasing) 
chemical reactions occurring within the fuel produce 
heat at a more rapid rate than can be removed from the 
fuel by the processes of thermal conduction, convection 
and heat radiation (box 10.3). these circumstances lead 
to an increase in the temperature of the fuel (i.e. the 
fuel is self-heating). this, in turn, causes the rate of 
the exothermic reaction to increase, thereby enhancing 
the heat release rate and speeding up the reaction still 
further (for many reactions, the temperature rise that 
is required to cause a doubling of rate is approximately 
10 °C). if this process continues unchecked, the ignition 
temperature of the fuel will eventually be reached and 
spontaneous combustion will ensue.
 
in most cases of spontaneous combustion, the 
exothermic reaction involved is the aerial oxidation of 
the fuel. As this takes place at the fuel–air interface, it 
is best facilitated if the surface area to volume ratio of 
the fuel is high, as in the case of finely divided solid 
fuels or liquid fuels soaked onto an absorbent matrix. 
furthermore, in order to allow the temperature to build 
up, the fuel will, in most cases, have to be in a thermally 
insulated environment that, nonetheless, is permeable to 
the air. these observations are entirely in keeping with 
the properties of the common fuels that are known to 
be susceptible to spontaneous combustion. these include 
crumpled rags soaked in a drying oil (such as ‘boiled’ 
linseed oil), stacked hay or other similar vegetable 
matter, and coal when stored in large stockpiles.
Pyrophoric carbon
the prolonged heating of significant amounts of wood 
at temperatures in excess of 105 °C, but more typically 
120–200 °C, under conditions in which ventilation 
is severely restricted can cause the production of 
sufficient flammable char to lead to a fire if enough air 
is subsequently admitted. the char forms because of the 
slow pyrolysis of the wood. Weeks, months or years may 
be needed for sufficient char to build up to pose a fire 
hazard. the char itself is known as pyrophoric carbon or 
pyrophoric charcoal. the adjective pyrophoric means ’will 
spontaneously combust on exposure to air or oxygen‘. 
it is used in this context because once air is allowed 
to gain access to the char at the elevated temperatures 
that formed it, it will undergo a self-heating, exothermic 
reaction, thus allowing ignition to occur.

conditions under which electrical heating can cause ignition temperatures to 
be reached. For example, this may happen when electricity passes through:
– a gas (in which case the current flow is referred to as an arc) (Box 10.2);
– a poor electrical contact in a wiring system;
– a heating element (e.g. as found in an electric cooker);
– the incandescent wire in a conventional light bulb;
– a conductor (such as an electrical wire) at a current that is in excess of 
that which it is designed to withstand;
– a failing organic insulating material.
n The nuclear reactions that occur in the Sun. These lead to the production of 
heat radiation (Box 10.3), which moves out into space in all directions from 
the Sun. This radiation delivers an insolation rate (i.e. the rate at which solar 
radiation delivers energy per unit horizontal area of the Earth’s surface) 
with a maximum of about 1 kW m–2. This is insufficient to ignite frequently 
encountered fuels. However, the action of a reflective concave surface or a 
transparent object capable of acting as a converging (i.e. convex) lens may 
focus the Sun’s rays. This may produce a maximum energy delivery rate of 
10–20 kW m–2, which is capable of heating cellulose-based fuels (e.g. news-
paper) to their ignition temperatures.
With the exception of fires caused by the self-heating of fuels, before ignition can 
occur energy must be transmitted to the fuel that is to be involved in the fire. This 
energy is usually supplied by heat, in which case, mechanisms by which it may be 
transmitted are thermal conduction, convection and heat radiation (Box 10.3). 
In some instances, one of these mechanisms dominates, while in others two or all 
three of them play a significant role. For example, the ignition of a property that is 
An arc is the discharge of electricity through a gas. Arcs 
vary considerably in scale, including both lightning 
bolts and the comparatively minute discharges of static 
electricity that may occur when a person walks across a 
dry carpet and reaches towards an earthed conductor. 
While arcs can ignite solid fuels, flammable vapours 
and gases are much more susceptible to this form of 
ignition and, as shown in the case described below, 
may be set on fire by small-scale arcs.
 
in 1922, there was an explosion in new York that 
was caused by the discharge of static electricity 
through a mixture of coal gas (a poisonous, highly 
flammable substance that is predominantly made up of 
hydrogen and methane) and air. the mixture was held 
in a tank made of iron and was being employed in the 
destruction of unwanted cats. the static electricity 
involved had built up on the fur of one of the tomcats 
as a direct consequence of his struggles to avoid being 
placed in the tank. When he eventually was dropped 
into the tank, the explosion that occurred scattered 
dead cats (including the tom) and injured the three 
people employed in disposing of the cats. All the 
injured people were lacerated and burnt to some extent 
and one of them sustained a suspected skull fracture.

heat (which is measured in joules, symbol J) is the name 
given to the interaction that occurs spontaneously when 
two objects at different temperatures are brought into 
thermal contact with one another. During this process, 
energy is spontaneously transferred by the heat inter-
action from the hotter object to the cooler one. in this 
context, the term interaction denotes an observable 
change that occurs in one part of the universe that is 
correlated with a corresponding change in another. 
for example, if a block of steel at 10 °C is brought 
into thermal contact with another at 20 °C, the cooler 
block will be observed to rise in temperature as thermal 
energy is transferred into it, while the warmer block’s 
temperature will fall as thermal energy flows from it.
 
there are three means by which thermal contact 
may be achieved, namely thermal conduction, 
convection and heat radiation. 
 
Thermal conduction is the transmission of heat 
through matter via the thermal excitation of the 
motion of its constituent particles (molecules, atoms, 
ions, etc.) and without the occurrence of macroscopic 
movement within the matter concerned. note that 
the term thermal conduction is often shortened to 
conduction where the context makes it clear that it is 
heat, and not electricity, that is being discussed.
 
Convection is the transmission of heat as a 
consequence of the macroscopic movement of a 
fluid medium. flows that are created in the fluid by 
this heat transfer mechanism are called convection 
currents. Clearly, convection will not happen within 
solids but can take place in both liquids and gases. 
the elevated temperatures that occur in a fire lead 
to the establishment of convection currents because 
of the heating and concomitant expansion of the 
immediately surrounding air that fires cause. this hot 
air, together with any hot gaseous combustion products, 
is significantly more buoyant than the comparatively 
cool air around it and so rises rapidly. this produces a 
decrease in the atmospheric pressure in the immediate 
vicinity of the fire, creating a horizontal pressure 
gradient. A force is therefore established along this 
gradient that accelerates cool air from the relatively 
high-pressure zone around the fire towards the fire 
itself. As this cool air approaches the fire, it too is 
heated and so becomes buoyant, thereby perpetuating 
the process. A portion of the thermal energy that is 
borne aloft in the plume of buoyant gas so created will 
be transferred by heat interactions with objects in its 
path. it is this form of convection that is responsible 
for the bulk of the movement of thermal energy that 
occurs in normal fires, such as may be encountered in 
buildings. in many cases, it is therefore largely, but not 
wholly, responsible for the spread of a normal fire and 
the pattern of damage that it leaves behind.
 
Heat radiation (also called radiant heat or, where 
the context makes it clear that it is heat that is being 
discussed, simply radiation) is the only means by which 
the heat interaction can occur through a vacuum. 
it refers to the transmission of heat in the form of 
electromagnetic radiation. the total amount of energy 
that is emitted in this form by an object per unit time 
per unit area (symbol E, measured in joules per second 
per square metre, i.e. J s–1 m–2, which is the same as 
the total power emitted in this form per unit area in 
watts per square metre, W m–2) is given by:
E = eσT4
where e is the total emissivity of the object, σ is 
stefan’s constant (5.7 x 10–8 J s–1 m–2 K–4) and T is the 
temperature of the object in kelvin, symbol K (i.e. its 
temperature in °C plus 273.15).
 
Consider an object that is completely enclosed and 
that is in thermal equilibrium with its enclosure (i.e. 
at the same temperature as its enclosure). Under these 
conditions, the energy emitted as heat radiation by 
the object per unit time per unit area will be identical 
to the heat radiation energy that it absorbs from its 
surroundings per unit time per unit area.
 
if, however, the object is at a lower temperature than 
its enclosure, it will radiate less energy than it absorbs

adjacent to a house that is on fire may occur principally because of heat radiation 
from the fire. In contrast, when the flame of a cigarette lighter is held under a piece 
of paper to set it on fire, the heat transfer will occur by all three mechanisms.
 
In many cases, a fire is ignited when a source of heat is physically moved into 
a position where it can supply energy at a high enough rate to cause the ignition 
temperature of a fuel to be reached. This physical movement may be deliberate, 
such as when an arsonist throws a lighted match onto a petrol-soaked carpet. 
However, this is not always the case. It may occur, for example, when convection 
currents carry a smouldering spark from an established fire into the air and it is 
then transported by the wind to a new batch of fuel.
Growth
During the early stages of a fire in a room, the combustion is normally limited to 
the fuel item that was originally ignited. This will burn freely, producing a plume of 
hot gas that is carried upwards by convection until it meets the ceiling, whereupon 
it will spread outwards until the walls are reached. At this point, the hot gas, which 
is depleted of oxygen and laden with the products of pyrolysis and combustion, 
forms a layer at the top of the room that will become thicker with time. Beneath 
this layer of hot gas, the air remains relatively fresh and cool. Typically, during the 
development of this layer, the fire will spread. The exact pattern that this spread 
takes varies from fire to fire and is dependent on the position of items of fuel 
relative to the fuel item that initially caught fire. If there is fuel above this item, 
it will typically ignite, allowing the fire to spread upwards and outwards, producing 
a characteristic V-shaped char pattern. Heat radiation from the combustion of the 
first fuel item to burn will often elevate neighbouring fuel items to their ignition 
temperatures, allowing the fire to spread horizontally. During the growth stage, fire 
development is not usually limited by the air supply but by the rate at which new 
fuel items become involved. Consequently, as the progress of the fire is limited by 
the availability of fuel, the fire is referred to as being fuel-controlled. 
 
The flames in the plume of hot gas that rises from burning fuel items vary in 
length. If a given fuel item, for example an armchair, were to burn on the floor of 
a room, its position in that room would influence the length of the flames that it 
produces. Flames produced by the item burning against a wall would typically be 
longer than if the item were burning in the centre of the room. If the item were to 
burn in a corner, its flames would normally be longer still. The explanation for this 
phenomenon lies in the rate at which air can be entrained in the rising plume of hot 
per unit time per unit area. Consequently, it will be a 
net importer of power and its temperature will therefore 
increase with time until thermal equilibrium is attained. 
in a similar fashion, during a fire, fuel that is below 
its ignition temperature may also act as a net importer 
of power in the form of heat radiation from actively 
combusting materials that are at higher temperatures 
than it. by this means, the fire may be spread if 
the relatively cool fuel is heated above its ignition 
temperature. this can be an important mechanism of fire 
spread, particularly in intense conflagrations.

gas within which the flames occur. A fire that occurs in an item resting on the floor 
in the middle of the room can draw in air from all sides. This air supplies oxygen 
that allows the gaseous pyrolysis products to burn shortly after their formation and 
cools the plume of gas. Both of these effects will tend to keep the flames short. 
The plume of hot gas rising from the same fire occurring near to a wall is more 
restricted in the directions from which it can entrain air. Consequently, the rate of 
air entrainment is comparatively low, meaning that the hot gases are not cooled to 
the same degree and the pyrolysis products take longer to burn, resulting in flame 
elongation. For the same reasons, the fire burning in the corner will have flames 
that are longer still.
 
As the fire grows, the heat release rate due to combustion will normally exceed 
the rate at which heat is transferred out of the room. As a consequence, the 
temperature of the room will rise. However, throughout the growth stage, the 
temperature differential between the hot gases in the upper part of the room and 
the relatively cool, relatively normal air in the lower part will be maintained.
 
Often the temperature in the layer of hot gas in the upper part of the room 
will become high enough to allow the pyrolysis products and partially combusted 
material that it contains to ignite. This ignition may happen due to flames, which 
may have become elongated because of their proximity to a wall or corner, reaching 
the hot gas layer from below. Once the hot gas layer ignites, the flame within it 
spreads at a very high rate (up to 3 to 5 m s–1). Consequently, within a period of a 
few seconds, all the room just beneath the ceiling may become engulfed in flame 
and the temperature of the hot gas zone will increase appreciably. The spread of 
flames through such flammable products of combustion, during the progress of a 
fire, is known as rollover or flameover. It may also be observed whenever these 
products escape from a zone of oxygen depletion into more normal air, so long as 
they are hot enough to ignite in their new environment. 
Flashover
As the temperature of the hot gases in the upper part of the room increases, so does 
the rate at which these transmit heat in the form of heat radiation (Box 10.3). In 
a room of normal dimensions, irrespective of whether or not flameover occurs, if 
this gas reaches a temperature of about 600 °C, the radiant heat that it produces 
reaches floor level at a rate of approximately 20 kW m–2. This is sufficient to ignite 
cellulose-based fuels, such as wood and cotton. Consequently, at this point, all fuel 
items in the room will burst into flames within a very short period of time. This 
phenomenon, in which all combustible items become involved in the fire, is known 
as radiation-induced flashover, or just flashover. The high level of turbulent 
mixing that accompanies this generalised burning disrupts the layered structure of 
the gases in the room that developed during the growth stage of the fire.
 
Flashover does not happen in all room fires. In order for it to occur, it is necessary 
for a layer of hot gases to accumulate in the upper part of the room and for these 
gases to reach a sufficiently high temperature. These conditions may not be met for 
a number of reasons. Flashover will not occur if:
n the room contains insufficient fuel;
n the fuel present releases heat at an insufficient rate;

n the level of ventilation is too low (insufficient ventilation will slow both 
the combustion process and the heat release rate – in extreme cases, poor 
ventilation may even extinguish the fire);
n the flow of heat and/or gases out of the room is too great.
Post-flashover steady-state burning (also referred to as a 
fully developed fire)
Once flashover has occurred, all of the fuel present in the room is involved in the 
fire and its heat release rate is maximal (Figure 10.1). At this stage, the fuel in 
the room will continue to burn at a rate that is determined by the amount of air 
available (i.e. it is ventilation-controlled) until most of this fuel has been used up. 
During this phase, because of the limited supply of oxygen, more gaseous fuel will 
normally be produced by pyrolysis and partial combustion than can be consumed 
within the room. Consequently, rollover flames are likely to occur as the hot smoke 
leaves the room.
Decay
As the available fuel is consumed, a point will be reached where the rate of air 
supply outstrips the fuel supply rate and the fire again becomes fuel-controlled. 
Consequently, during this phase, as the fuel supply drops, so does the heat release 
rate (Figure 10.1). At the same time, the amount of flaming combustion present will 
decrease as the ability of the remaining fuel to form flammable pyrolysis products 
diminishes. Eventually, the fire will be dominated by smouldering combustion and, 
ultimately, the fire will self-extinguish.
 
In a room fire, decay can also occur under ventilation control if the air supply is so 
low that the flames die down. Under these conditions, the concentration of flammable 
pyrolysis products may build up sufficiently to create the conditions necessary for 
flashback to ensue if air is suddenly admitted to the room (Section 10.1).
10.2.2  Outdoor fires
Outdoor fires ignite for the same reason and in essentially the same way as do 
fires within rooms and similar compartments. However, once lit, the behaviour of 
outdoor fires is, in the main, much simpler than that of fires that occur in rooms.
 
Consider a small flaming fire that is lit in an open space, on flat, horizontal 
ground, on a still day. The high temperatures of the fire will cause convection 
currents to be established (Box 10.3) that involve a plume of hot gases rising above 
the fire and a flow of air from surrounding areas into the base of the fire. The fire will 
move outwards in the direction of available fuel. This process will occur fairly slowly 
because the convection-driven stream of air that is moving towards the base of the 
fire almost exclusively transports heat away from the direction of fire propagation, 
leaving conduction and radiation as the only means of raising surrounding fuel 
items to their ignition temperatures. Under these circumstances, if the fire is evenly 
surrounded by sufficient fuel with identical burning characteristics, a circular fire 
spread pattern will result (Figure 10.2).

If this same fire were to occur on a slope, however, the convection currents 
would cause hot gases to heat any fuel on its up-hill side, thereby facilitating the 
much more rapid spread of fire in this direction. This will typically produce a fan-
shaped fire spread pattern (Figure 10.3). Note that slow down-hill burning will also 
occur due to the mechanisms described in the previous paragraph. In addition, any 
burning items, such as the branches of trees, that fall down-slope out of the burning 
zone, may well create new centres of ignition, each of which will typically produce 
its own fan-shaped burn pattern.
 
Ambient wind has the effect of pushing the plume of hot gases that arise from the 
top of a fire towards the ground. This, like the effect of a slope, will help the spread 
of fire, in this case in a downwind direction. On flat, horizontal land that is evenly 
covered in fuel of similar burning characteristics, wind that is blowing strongly in 
one direction will typically produce a burn pattern that is significantly longer than 
it is wide. It is noteworthy that wind-driven sparks from one fire can kindle a new 
fire in a downwind location.
 
Fierce fires produce significant amounts of radiant heat. This can cause fire to 
move from one place to another, even though the intervening space contains no 
fuel. This can result in one burning building setting another on fire.
10.3 Fire scene investigation
A fire investigation will have a number of aims. Typically these include:
n the identification of where the fire started (known as the seat of fire or 
point of origin);

n the determination of the cause of the fire (the meaning of this term is 
described below) and whether it was intentionally started;
n the establishment of legal liabilities associated with the fire;
n the determination of the factors that contributed to and controlled both 
the fire’s spread and the production of heat, flame and smoke during its 
progress;
n the identification of any health and safety issues that arose during the 
fighting of the fire;
n the identification of dangerous practices, materials and manufactured items 
that contributed to the start or progress of the fire;
n the collection of data for use by policy makers.
In addition, in cases in which claims are to be made against insurance policies, 
loss adjusters will be instructed by the insurance companies involved to assess the 
extent and monetary value of fire damage.
 
Fire scene investigations will achieve their optimum effectiveness only if they are 
carried out with due care, diligence and expertise, and in an ethically and legally 
acceptable fashion.

As explained in Section 10.1, a fire will start whenever a suitable fuel and 
oxidant, which are capable of a self-sustaining chain reaction, are brought together 
in appropriate proportions and provided with sufficient energy for ignition to occur. 
A statement of how these conditions arose at the start of a particular fire is a 
statement of the cause of fire. 
 
Throughout the populated world, a disturbingly high proportion of fires are 
deliberately started. For example, in the UK, in 2007 approximately 16 per cent 
of fires attended by local authority fire brigades were either known to be or 
suspected of being intentionally ignited. However, prior to the commencement of 
the investigation of any one fire, it is usually not clear whether the fire concerned 
was deliberately started and, if so, that arson has been committed (see Box 10.4 
for a definition of arson and a description of the motives of arsonists). This means 
that each fire scene that is investigated should be treated as if it were a crime 
scene until and unless it is established that this is not the case. This precautionary 
approach is wise for the following reason. If an investigation establishes that it is 
likely that arson has occurred, and the processing of the site has not been carried 
out as if it were a crime scene, then the value to any subsequent prosecution case 
of evidence obtained from the scene might be severely limited. Consequently, the 
principles of crime scene processing (including those relating to the preservation 
and recording of the scene and the recovery of items of physical evidence), as set 
out in Chapter 2, are also relevant to fire scene processing. However, in the UK, 
while non-fire crime scenes are handled exclusively by the police, police scientific 
support professionals and experts that may be called to the scene by the police, fire 
scene processing also involves Fire Scene Investigators (who are employees of the 
Fire Service). Indeed, unless the examination of a fire incident reveals that a crime 
may have been committed, the entire investigation, except that undertaken by loss 
adjusters, will be carried out by such Fire Investigation Officers and any experts that 
they may call in.

defect that allowed

Arson may be defined as the deliberate, malicious 
setting on fire of property, either one’s own with 
the intent to defraud (e.g. by making a fraudulent 
insurance claim) or someone else’s. in the UK, the 
law concerning arson is set down in section one 
of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. for the police to 
record a particular incident of fire as arson, they must 
have sufficient proof of intent, recklessness and the 
involvement of property.
Adults
there are a number of motives that lead adults to commit 
arson. As indicated in table 10.1, in some cases, the 
nature of the motive will help shape the arsonist’s modus 
operandi (Mo). (the Mo of a criminal is the manner in 
which he or she carries out the crime concerned.) it must 
be stressed that the connection between motive and Mo 
is tentative; there is no guarantee that a given motive 
will lead to a particular Mo in each case.

Clearly, from a forensic science perspective, it is of paramount importance to 
investigate a fire scene with a view to establishing whether the fire was caused 
intentionally. In order to do this, it is normally necessary to determine both the seat 
and the cause of the fire. The remainder of this section is dedicated to a review of 
the principles that allow this to be done.
10.3.1  Witnesses and background information
Eyewitnesses to the fire can provide valuable information that will help the fire 
investigator rationalise the observations that he or she makes at the scene once the 
fire has been extinguished. Fire-fighters in attendance will be able to provide facts 
such as the times at which the alarm was raised and of their arrival on the scene. 
They will also be able to supply information about the progress of the fire and the 
methods that they employed in tackling it. This could include, where applicable, 
where the fire appeared to have spread from, whether or not it was accompanied by 
explosions, whether radiation-induced flashover occurred and the location of any 
windows that were broken as a consequence of the fire. It may also include how and 
where the fire-fighters gained access to the premises, which, if any, windows they 
broke, any actions taken by the fire-fighters to ventilate a building that was on fire 
and where they applied water.
 
Eyewitnesses among the public, although likely to be less reliable than fire-fighters 
in their recollections, can nonetheless provide useful insights. For example, they may 
be able to recall the region of the premises in which the fire was first seen, whether 
the fire was preceded by apparent interruptions to any electricity supply and whether 
the fire appeared to be preceded by or accompanied by an explosion or explosions.
 
The owner or tenant of any building damaged by fire should be able to provide 
details of the contents of its rooms immediately prior to the fire. Ideally, this will 
include the locations of pieces of furniture, appliances, machines, any flammable 
liquids or gases held on the property and any particularly valuable items. 
Furthermore, the owner or tenant should be able to give information about the 
security of the building, in particular whether all of the external doors and windows 
were locked prior to the fire (which may or may not be corroborated by evidence 
supplied by the fire-fighters). Later in the investigation, laboratory tests may 
be carried out on items or materials that were involved in the fire (e.g. electrical 
Children
Children as young as 3 years old may deliberately 
start fires. they do this out of curiosity (carried out 
by younger children who are essentially ‘playing with 
fire’), in order to vandalise property (typically by older 
children), as a response to a crisis or abuse, to seek 
attention and/or as an expression of anger.
 
in the case of curiosity-motivated fires, the child 
concerned may be unaware of the consequences of 
fire setting. in other cases, the fire may be intended 
to be small or confined to targets of limited economic 
value (e.g. rubbish bins). Regrettably, some older 
children set fires with the intent of causing extensive 
destruction. inevitably, the nature of fire means that 
even those started out of curiosity or intended to 
remain small may result in a large-scale conflagration 
with significant loss of property and possible injury 
and/or the loss of life.
Box 10.4  continued

appliances or, in the case of industrial premises, process chemicals). Under these 
circumstances, a detailed inventory of the pre-fire contents of the building may be 
very helpful as it could provide information that allows undamaged control samples 
to be obtained for comparative purposes.
 
In order to obtain the maximum amount of reliable information, the interviewing 
of witnesses is best performed in a highly objective way by appropriately trained 
and experienced personnel. Such interviews should be approached with appropriate 
sensitivity, be properly recorded and the procedures adopted must be legally 
acceptable. It should be borne in mind that one of the interviewees might be the 
person who set the fire in the first place.
 
Background documentation, such as photographs or videotapes taken of the 
scene either before or during the fire (including any taken of the onlookers during 
the tackling of the fire), can be of value. Architect’s drawings/plans of any building 
involved in the fire can also be useful in this respect.
 
It is useful to know of any history of previous fires at the same location and/or in 
the neighbourhood. Some premises have a legitimate history of fires, as may be the 
case in certain industrial plants. However, it is not unknown for an arsonist either 
to attempt to burn down a facility with such a history or to repeatedly set fire to the 
same structure.
10.3.2  Processing the scene
As stated earlier, it is wise to treat all fire scene investigations as if they are crime 
scene investigations until there is reason to know otherwise. With this in mind, 
attention should be paid to the preservation and recording (using notes, sketches, 
photographs and video, as appropriate) of the scene, and the recovery of items of 
physical evidence from the scene (Chapter 2).
 
As a part of the preservation of the scene, a cordon should be placed around 
the scene at the earliest practicable opportunity, in order to restrict access to 
the site to authorised personnel only. Once the scene has been secured, it can be 
systematically searched, a process that often progresses from the least damaged 
to the most damaged areas. The aims of the search include the identification of 
indicators that help to locate the seat of the fire and those that provide evidence of 
the cause of the fire (see below for more details).
 
In cases of suspected arson, items of physical evidence that may link the scene, 
and/or the events that took place during the setting of the fire, to any perpetrator 
will also be searched for. These items will be treated in the same manner as those 
taken from any other crime scene (Chapter 2).
 
The search of a site at which there has been a building fire will normally 
commence with an inspection of the outside of the building and a systematic 
examination of the grounds in which it stands (which will be inside the cordon). The 
search of the grounds will focus on finding items of physical evidence. These could 
include tools that might have been used by an arsonist to break into the property, 
containers that may have held flammable liquids used by an arsonist to accelerate 
the spread of the fire (such liquids are examples of fire accelerants) or footprints 
that he or she left at the scene. In cases in which an explosion (or explosions) took 
place in addition to the fire, this search will also be used to locate any items of 
debris that were distributed outside the building by the blast.

An inspection of the exterior of the building will normally be of value as it may 
help the investigator to ascertain:
n safety issues associated with entering it (e.g. the presence of harmful 
materials released by the fire (e.g. smoke, hazardous building materials such 
as asbestos) or structures in danger of collapse);
n any signs that the building might have been forcibly entered before the fire 
took place;
n indications of the region of the building that contains the seat of the fire.
In outdoor vegetation fires, an indication of the likely location of the seat of the 
fire can be gained from the burn pattern, the topography of the land, knowledge 
of the weather conditions at the time of the fire and eyewitness accounts. In such 
cases, the search will normally start in those areas that are most remote from the 
seat, systematically moving towards the seat with an ever-increasing degree of 
thoroughness as the seat is approached.
10.3.3  Finding the seat of a fire
In order to find the seat of a fire, an investigator will normally make use of any 
eyewitness accounts of the spread of the fire and interpret the pattern of damage 
created by the fire. This interpretation requires knowledge of the nature and 
behaviour of fire, and is the subject of this section. Unfortunately, there is no single 
indicator within the patterns that are left by fires that can be used to unequivocally 
locate fire seats in all circumstances. In most cases, the investigator will use 
multiple indicators that, when considered together, enable the seat to be found. 
This is not a simple matter, and while the description provided here cannot be 
comprehensive, it serves as an introduction to this topic.
 
Consider a matrix of solid fuel that is in contact with the air, such as dry vegetation 
in an outdoor fire or the flammable furniture and fittings of a house on fire. If an 
adequate air supply is maintained, once a fire is started, it will spread through this 
matrix – provided that the portions of the fuel that are on fire can supply heat at a 
sufficient rate to bring new parts of the fuel to their ignition temperatures.
 
As explained in Box 10.3, heat may be transferred by three mechanisms, 
namely conduction, convection and radiation. In a fire that is burning without the 
constraint of physical barriers:
n convection moves heat upwards;
n conduction moves heat away from its source via the material through which 
it is travelling;
n radiation allows heat to travel in all directions from its point of origin, unless 
it is absorbed or reflected.
Importantly, under most circumstances, convection is the most efficient of these 
three mechanisms at transferring heat from burning fuel to fuel that is yet to ignite. 
Consequently, fire will tend to move upwards through a three-dimensional matrix of 
solid fuel much more rapidly than outwards or downwards. This will tend to produce 

 
 340 n fiREs
a conical pattern of fire development, which is narrowest at the bottom and widest 
at the top and which has the seat of the fire at or very near to its base. Any vertical, 
or near-vertical, flat surface (e.g. a wall) that comes into contact with this will tend 
to have a burn pattern on it that is approximately V-shaped. In objects that are 
partially burnt through, these V-shaped patterns may also be evident, either in full 
or in part (Figure 10.4).
 
Such V-shapes are useful as, in the main, they become narrower as the initial 
ignition point is neared. Note that, as illustrated in Figure 10.5, such V-shaped patterns 
may be evident when a burnt building is viewed as a whole from the outside. Also, as 
described before in this chapter, for reasons similar to those previously outlined in that 
paragraph, outdoor vegetation fires on slopes tend to be fan-shaped with the seat of the 
fire located near to, but above, the bottom of the pattern (Figure 10.3). Note also that 
the smoke patterns seen in fire-damaged buildings also tend to show approximately 
V-shaped patterns, which point towards the initial point of ignition at their base.
 
There are some important modifying factors that can alter the shape of these 
V-shaped patterns. Wind, or other externally generated airflows, may alter the path 
of the convection currents that are largely responsible for the upward movement 
of heat and smoke through the fuel matrix, thereby modifying the burn and smoke

patterns that remain after the fire has ceased. The top of V-shaped patterns may 
become dramatically broader beneath horizontal obstructions to vertical flow 
(especially ceilings). In room fires, this will often lead to the development of a 
progressively deepening layer of hot gas immediately beneath the ceiling. This will 
produce charring and smoke deposition on the entire ceiling and the walls that it 
has contact with. If the fire is intense enough, this situation may lead to radiation-
induced flashover (Section 10.2) which may cause the large-scale disruption of any 
V-shaped patterns produced in the room up until that point. Also, when a room is 
on fire, objects such as curtains, pictures and light fittings may catch alight and 
drop onto fresh fuel from above, thereby spreading the fire. This dropdown (as it 
is called) will often cause what appear to be multiple seats of the fire. This can be 
highly misleading, as the genuine presence of multiple seats is a strong indicator of 
a deliberately ignited fire (Box 10.4). Finally, it should be noted that fire can lead 
to the formation of an inverted V-shaped pattern on a wall, or similar vertical object. 
For example, this can happen in a room when a fire occurs in a relatively small 
amount of fuel that is near to the vertical object concerned but does not directly 
lead to the spread of fire up it. The contents of a waste-paper bin, a dropdown and a 
pool of flammable liquid are all examples of fuel items that may cause this effect.  
 
In many fires, the area of most intense destruction corresponds with the region 
that contains the seat, as it is here that the fire usually has had longest to become 
established and to act. There are a number of indicators that can be used to discern 
patterns in the degree of destruction, including the comparison of depths of char 
formed on wooden items (Figure 10.6). The depth of char that is formed depends 
on a number of factors. These include the species of the wood, whether the wood 
is cut with or across the grain, the length of time that the wood has been exposed to

heat, the rate at which heat is supplied to each unit area of the wood, and the shape 
and thickness of the item concerned. Nonetheless, the measurement of char thickness 
on items made of the same type of wood that are found at the same vertical height 
but at different locations within the fire scene can give a comparative indication of the 
intensity of destruction at those locations. Under these circumstances, the char tends 
to become deeper as the intensity of destruction becomes greater. It is important to 
note, however, that interpretation of observations designed to reveal the intensity of 
destruction needs great care. This is because factors such as the degree of ventilation, 
fuel loading and fire-fighting activities can have a significant impact on the intensity of 
destruction that is wrought at any one location within a given fire scene.
 
A number of materials that are commonly encountered in fire-damaged areas and 
structures are both marked by fire and are poor conductors of heat. These include 
common fuel materials (e.g. wood), as well as non-flammable substances (e.g. 
concrete). Objects made of such materials – such as wooden doors or concrete pillars 
– are frequently marked to a greater degree on the side facing the fire than on the 
side facing away from it (Figure 10.7). Therefore, if the position of such objects at 
the time of the fire is known, the markings on them may be useful in establishing the 
direction from which the fire came. Ultimately, this may lead to the seat of the fire.

Certain fire alarm and/or sprinkler systems can be interrogated after a fire to show 
the order in which different parts of the system concerned were activated by the spread 
of the fire. This can be used to work out the region in which the fire first started.
 
Heat may bring about physical and/or chemical changes in a number of non-
flammable materials – including glass, concrete, plaster and many metals. These 
changes can also produce features that help to indicate where the seat of the fire 
is likely to be located. For example, light bulbs that are filled with inert gas tend to 
extend towards, and then burst in, the direction of maximum heating.
10.3.4  Establishing the cause of a fire
Most fires start when a source of ignition supplies sufficient energy, usually as heat, 
to light a fuel that is already in contact with a suitable oxidising agent (in the vast 
majority of cases, this oxidising agent is oxygen (O2), provided by the air). Under 
these circumstances, the key to establishing the cause of the fire is normally the 
finding of its seat (see above). Doing this will often enable the identity and/or 
location of the fuel item in which the fire started to be established.
 
Once the seat has been located, it should be examined with great care, with 
particular attention being paid to likely initial fuel items and possible sources of 
ignition. In some instances, direct evidence of such sources may be present. For 
example, there may be an electric heater that is clearly dangerously close to what 
is likely to be the remnants of the initial fuel item. However, in others this may not 
be the case, as when an arsonist starts a fire with a cigarette lighter that he or she 
subsequently takes away when leaving the scene.
 
From a forensic science point of view, the most important feature to be 
established concerning the cause of a fire is whether the fire was deliberately 
started, as the crime of arson necessarily involves this act (Box 10.4). There 
are many indications of deliberate fire setting, some of which are essentially 
unequivocal (e.g. finding the remains of an incendiary device at the seat of the fire) 
while others are circumstantial. Some of these indicators may be found at the scene 
and others elsewhere. Clearly, no two instances of deliberately set fires are the same 
and the exact nature and number of indicators left by the fire setter will vary from 
case to case. However, there are a number of more commonly encountered classes 
of indications of the deliberate starting of fire. Notably these include the following:
n Lack of evidence for a natural or accidental cause of the fire (note that this 
in itself is not normally sufficient to establish that the fire was deliberately 
started; also, attempts may be made to make deliberate fires appear to be 
accidental by, for instance, starting them with, or near to, heating appliances, 
cookers, machinery, etc.).
n Evidence that a flammable liquid was among the first fuels to be ignited. 
Such evidence may include:
– burning at low elevations within the fire-damaged area (Figure 10.8);
– burn patterns that are localised (Figure 10.8);
– burn patterns that show sharp, curved edges (Figure 10.8);
– the presumptive detection of vapours of hydrocarbon (or other) liquid 
fuels from locations (e.g. cracks between floorboards) and materials 
(e.g. carpet underlay) that may have offered the liquid protection from 

 
fiRE sCEnE invEstigAtion n 345
being burnt (such presumptive detection may be achieved by using the 
human sense of smell, trained ‘sniffer’ dogs (known as hydrocarbon search 
canines) and/or portable electronic detectors);
– detection and identification of liquid fuel by the laboratory analysis of 
samples retrieved from the scene (this is the only definitive evidence for the 
presence of flammable liquids and is discussed further in Section 10.4).
 
Note that other materials (such as burning plastics and dropdowns) can 
mimic the burn patterns produced by flammable liquids; also the presence 
of flammable liquid does not prove deliberate fire setting as such liquids may 
have been innocently stored at the scene prior to the fire.
n Evidence of the presence of an unusually high quantity and/or quality of fuel 
at the seat of the fire (which may be exhibited, for example, in unexpectedly 
severe destruction).
n Objects suspiciously out of place, for example:
– piles of fuel items (which may be evidenced by the presence of otherwise 
inexplicably high numbers of hinges, drawer locks, furniture springs, etc. 
within the ash); 
– containers that may have held flammable liquids found in unexpected 
places;
– tools or other equipment that might have been used to break into a 
property or to perpetrate sabotage;
– filing cabinet or desk drawers left open (to aid the combustion of documents);
– the substitution of good furniture for poor-quality items; the prior removal 
of objects of sentimental or monetary value (e.g. photographs, jewellery or 
share certificates);
– otherwise inexplicable escape of pets;
– doors, windows or roof space access hatches wedged or left open;
– electrical switches left on that would normally be expected to be off;
– heating system thermostats set unusually high (to improve ventilation);
– objects placed so as to hinder the activities of the fire brigade;

– transparent or reflective objects that are capable of focusing the Sun’s 
rays left in a position where they could lead to the ignition of fuel.
n Unusual damage, for example:
– partition walls/ceilings/floors broken through to improve ventilation and 
aid the spread of the fire;
– signs of break-in;
– disabled fire and/or intruder alarms;
– indications of sabotage (e.g. cut fuel pipes, electrical supply systems that 
have been tampered with).
n Evidence that a crime was committed at the scene prior to the fire.
n A history of fires in the building or neighbourhood concerned and/or a 
similar history associated with anyone who stands to gain from the fire.
n A familiar face in the crowd watching the fire or someone leaving the scene 
(most people are attracted by the spectacle of a fire and will want to observe it).
n The presence of one or more incendiary devices or their remains. Examples 
of such devices include:
– incendiary devices with a time-delayed action (which may be very simple, 
such as a balloon, or similar container, filled with flammable liquid and 
left above an ignition source);
– Molotov cocktail (i.e. a container filled with a flammable liquid and 
equipped with an ignition device designed to light the liquid when the 
container is broken – Molotov cocktails are usually thrown);
– a purely chemical means of causing ignition.
n Fire safety systems such as automatic fire detection systems and/or sprinkler 
systems turned off or made inoperative.
n Multiple fire seats (if this occurs, intact but failed incendiary devices may be 
found elsewhere on the premises).
n Evidence of lines of flammable material (known as trailers) deliberately 
placed so as to spread the fire from one location to another.
n Mismatches between statements made by, for example, the owner of the 
fire-damaged property (including any contents inventory provided) and the 
sequence of events known to have taken place during the incident and/or the 
physical evidence left after the fire.
n Indications of a motive for arson among any people who had the potential to 
start the fire (Box 10.4).
n Patterns of destruction in any one fire or patterns that emerge when the 
characteristics of several fires are compared that suggest that an arsonist 
may be at work (Box 10.4).
In cases of arson, these indicators not only help establish the cause of the fire, 
but may also give an insight into the possible motives of the arsonist. For further 
information on this important topic, see Box 10.4.

10.4 The analysis of fire accelerants
Laboratory-based chemical analysis of samples connected with cases of suspected 
illegal fire setting (whether successful or attempted) can provide valuable evidence. 
Such samples may be those recovered from the scene of a fire (whether actual or 
apparently intended), any suspects involved in the case and/or the possessions of 
those suspects.
 
The initial purpose of such analysis is to establish whether the sample contains a 
substance that may have been used with the aim of increasing the rate of fire spread 
(i.e. a potential fire accelerant). Furthermore, laboratory analysis may:
n identify the chemical nature of any fire accelerant detected;
n allow the amount of any such material present in the sample to be 
established; and/or
n provide points of comparison between samples taken from different locations.
The last of these may be of particular importance in helping to establish a link 
between a suspect and an apparent crime scene.
 
During analytical work of this type, distinction is made between trace and bulk 
quantities of questioned material. As a rule of thumb, trace quantities are those 
that are too small to be seen with the naked eye and, conversely, anything that 
can be seen under these conditions is present in bulk amounts. An example of the 
former of these is the low level of petrol that may remain on an arsonist’s clothing 
after he or she used this fuel as a fire accelerant.
 
This distinction between trace and bulk amounts of questioned material is 
important for a number of reasons. These include the great potential that bulk 
samples have for contaminating items that are suspected of containing trace 
quantities of incriminating material. It is vital therefore that rigorous systems 
are in place that ensure that such items can never be brought into contact with 
bulk samples or traces of material that have come from those bulk samples. The 
necessity for the avoidance of cross-contamination of this type increases with the 
sensitivity of the technique employed for the analysis of the items concerned.
 
In cases of arson, the fire accelerants most commonly detected by laboratory 
analysis are liquid fuels. Among these, liquid petroleum distillates are the most 
frequently encountered, although other flammable liquids, such as short-chain 
alcohols (e.g. ethanol), may also be used as accelerants. The most prevalent 
petroleum distillate found in this context is petrol but others, such as paraffin or 
diesel oil, may be employed by an arsonist. Each of these distillates is a complex 
mixture of volatile hydrocarbons (a hydrocarbon is a compound that contains only 
hydrogen and carbon).
 
Gas chromatography (GC, see Chapter 11, Box 11.5) is the main technique used 
to analyse samples suspected of containing liquid fire accelerants. This is because 
not only is GC a means of analysing volatile compounds that is highly sensitive 
(and so can be used for the analysis of trace as well as bulk samples), it is also 
capable of isolating, and potentially identifying, individual components of mixtures 
of such compounds. Furthermore, in cases of complex mixtures, it can produce a 
pattern that is characteristic of the mixture concerned. This pattern acts as a class 

 
 348 n fiREs
characteristic of the mixture, allowing, for example, petrol to be distinguished from 
diesel oil (Figure 10.9). Also, if a pattern obtained from a sample taken from one 
location is found to match that generated by a sample taken from another, this 
establishes that the two samples could have had the same origin. Therefore, if such 
a match were to be found between samples of liquid taken from the floor of a fire-
damaged house and a largely empty petrol can found in a suspect’s possession, this 
would mean that the liquid in the house could have come from the can.
 
When carrying out the laboratory analysis of samples that are suspected of 
containing fire accelerants, the parallel analysis of appropriate control samples 
may be of utmost importance. In this context, the control samples chosen will 
be ones intended to replicate the matrix within which the accelerant is believed 
to reside in the questioned samples. Such controls may aid the interpretation 
of the results of the analysis of the questioned samples and be of fundamental 
importance in ensuring that the findings are truly rigorous. For example, during a 
fire investigation, fire-damaged carpet may be found that exhibits signs (e.g. odour 
and burn pattern) that indicate the presence of liquid hydrocarbon fuel. This carpet 
would be sampled and sent for analysis. If, at the same time, control samples of 
that same fire-damaged carpet were taken from an area that shows no evidence 
of containing liquid fuel, this would aid the interpretation of GC analysis carried 
out in the laboratory. This is because GC alone cannot distinguish the origin of 
the compounds that it detects. If the questioned sample of carpet were to contain 
petrol, volatile combustion products and volatile chemicals that were present in it 
before the fire, all three classes of material would be represented in the GC results. 
However, GC analysis of the control sample would only show the latter two classes. 
Subtraction of the results of the analysis of the control sample from those of the 
questioned sample will help the analyst to discern the data relating to the petrol. 
Furthermore, the analyst will be able to demonstrate to a court that the results 
that he or she has attributed to petrol have not originated either from the carpet or 
from the combustion products of the fire.
 
It is vitally important to realise that analytical data that show the presence of 
flammable liquid are not proof that a crime has been committed. For example, 
petrol may be found on the floor of a fire scene because it was stored at that scene 
for legitimate purposes and the container in which it was held burst during the fire. 
Similarly, analytical data that show a match between an accelerant recovered from 
an arson scene and flammable liquid found in the possession of a suspect do not 
provide proof that the individual concerned perpetrated the crime in question. This 
is because the analysis of flammable liquids reveals class characteristics and not 
individualising ones (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1).

1. Describe the means by which heat is transmitted from a flaming match to 
a piece of newspaper that is ignited by that match. Explain why it is easier 
to light a piece of crumpled newspaper in this way if the match is held 
underneath the paper rather than above it.
2. Discuss whether a small outdoor fire in the early stages of its development 
would normally be ventilation-controlled or fuel-controlled.
3. An arsonist who wishes to make money from his or her crime by submitting 
a subsequent claim to an insurance company is faced with a fundamental 
dilemma. On one hand, if this crime is to be successful, the fire must do as 
much damage as possible. However, on the other, the types of measure that 
he or she could take in order to ensure that damage is maximal (e.g. the 
use of a fire accelerant, the disarming of automatic fire-fighting systems) will 
leave evidence that the fire was deliberately set. Review the various means by 
which the arsonist might attempt to overcome this dilemma. For each such 
means, describe the evidence that might be left by the arsonist that may be 
uncovered by a skilful investigator.
4. During a fire scene investigation, it is of great importance to be able to 
establish whether the fire was started deliberately or accidentally. Discuss 
the features of a scene that would indicate to you that it was the scene of a 
deliberately set fire and how these features would contrast with those that 
may be observed at the scene of a fire of accidental cause.
5. When collecting, storing and transporting samples from fire scenes for sub-
sequent laboratory-based forensic analysis, what steps would you take to 
ensure that:
(a) adequate control samples are taken;
(b) all samples can be uniquely identified; and
(c) contamination of the samples cannot occur?
n fire will occur whenever a suitable fuel and oxidant, which 
are capable of undergoing a self-sustaining chemical chain 
reaction, are in contact and exposed to sufficient energy 
(usually in the form of heat) to cause ignition to occur. 
in the absence of fire-fighting activities, once ignited, a 
normal fire within a typical room or similar compartment 
can be described as passing through each of four stages 
before self-extinguishing. these stages are called growth, 
flashover, post-flashover steady-state burning and decay. 
the behaviour of fires in the open is somewhat simpler, but 
is influenced by the slope of the land and wind direction.
n fire scene investigations are carried out for a number of 
reasons. important among these are, for a given fire, the 
establishment of both where it started (i.e. finding its seat)
 
and its cause. the deliberate ignition of fires is a significant 
problem in both the UK and elsewhere. given that at the 
outset of the investigation of any one fire, it is not necess-
arily clear whether it was intentionally ignited, it is wise 
to treat each fire scene as if it were a crime scene until 
it is established that it is not. the identification of a fire 
as one that has been deliberately started is based on the 
observation of one or more indications, such as the presence 
at the scene of incendiary devices (or their remains) or 
evidence that flammable liquids have been used to accelerate 
the spread of fire. the presence of flammable liquids can 
only be unequivocally established if they are found during 
the laboratory analysis of samples taken from the scene. 
such analyses may reveal class characteristics that help to 
establish links between items, scenes and/or individuals.

Introduction
Regrettably, the destructive nature of explosions has been used by a number of 
terrorist organisations and criminals as a means of furthering their particular aims. 
Explosions have been used to terrorise communities, murder individuals, damage 
property and facilitate theft (as in the case of safe-breaking).
 
This chapter describes what is meant by the terms explosion and explosive. It 
explores the means by which explosion scenes can be investigated and the role of 
laboratory-based techniques in the analysis of samples that are suspected of either 
being explosives or being contaminated with them.
11.1 The classification of explosions 
  
   and explosives
An explosion is a manifestation of a sudden release of energy. It may be defined 
as the violent effect produced by the rapid build-up of gas pressure at a location 
because of the sudden liberation of energy and, in most cases, gas at that location. 
The process that leads to a given explosion may be chemical, mechanical, thermal, 
electrical or nuclear in nature. In the forensic context, explosions directly caused by 
chemical reactions are the most interesting and are described later in this section.

Explosion
The violent effect 
produced by the 
rapid build-up of 
gas pressure at a 
location because 
of the sudden 
liberation of energy 
and, in most cases, 
gas at that location.

 
the cLAssificAtion of expLosions AnD expLosives n 353
Mechanical explosions occur when containers of pressurised gas and/or liquid 
burst to liberate gas. Such explosions may happen, for example, in a fire or when 
a system that is designed to be pressurised from within becomes over-pressurised 
(e.g. a vehicle tyre that is over-inflated). Thermal explosions may be produced when 
a liquid is rapidly brought to its boiling point by contact with another liquid that 
is significantly hotter than it, such as may happen if water and molten steel are 
allowed to meet. An electrical explosion results if the heating effect of the discharge 
of electricity through an electrically insulating material is sufficiently intense. 
Nuclear explosions are beyond the scope of this book and will not be discussed here.
 
Any substance that is capable of producing an explosion is known as an explosive. 
However, most commonly, and in this book, the term explosive is used to denote any one 
of those materials that can produce explosions as a consequence of chemical reactions. 
Clearly, any substance of this type must be able to undergo a chemical process that rapidly 
releases energy and, ideally, gas. To trigger an explosion, this process must be initiated. 
Initiation requires the supply of sufficient energy, in a utilisable form, to at least some 
part of the explosive.1 In order to be an explosive, a material must therefore be capable of 
propagating the explosive chemical process through itself from the site of initiation.
 
There are many explosives known that consist of suitable oxidising and reducing 
agents that are present in intimate combination and in appropriate proportions. 
This combination may be achieved by the physical mixing of materials that have 
oxidising properties with those that have reducing ones. Typical oxidising materials 
used for this purpose include inorganic nitrates, perchlorates and chlorates. 
Suitable reducing materials, which may be thought of as fuels, include carbon, 
sulphur, hydrocarbons, carbohydrates (e.g. sugar) and finely divided metals (e.g. 
aluminium). Gunpowder (also called black powder) is the archetypal explosive of 
this sort. It is a mixture of saltpetre (potassium nitrate), charcoal (carbon) and 
sulphur. Another commonly encountered explosive mixture is ammonium nitrate 
and fuel oil (ANFO), which is used as a blasting agent in quarries.
 
An alternative means of achieving the intimate combination of oxidising and 
reducing agents is to synthesise a compound, parts of which are oxidising in nature 
while others are reducing. Such compounds tend to produce a more dramatic explosive 
effect than do physical mixtures of oxidising and reducing materials. They include:
n 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT);
n cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX);
n glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerine);
n 2,4,6-trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (tetryl);
n cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX); and 
n pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN).
It is important to realise, however, that many explosive formulations that contain 
explosive compounds are, in fact, blended products. These blends are made in order 
to modify the characteristics of the pure materials from which they are formulated. 
For example, nitroglycerine is rendered much safer to handle by combining it with 
1 Some explosive materials may liberate sufficient energy by internal chemical reactions to cause 
an explosion to be initiated without the input of energy from outside. That is, they spontane-
ously explode (e.g. mixtures containing sulphur and a chlorate are notorious for doing this). 
Clearly, this is not a desirable characteristic in useful explosives.
Explosive
Any substance 
that is capable 
of producing an 
explosion (although 
this term is 
commonly restricted 
to those substances 
that can produce 
explosions due to 
chemical reactions).
Oxidising agent
A chemical species 
that is capable of 
accepting electrons 
from another 
chemical species. 
Also known as an 
oxidant.
Reducing agent
A chemical species 
that is capable of 
donating electrons 
to another chemical 
species. Also known 
as a reductant.

an inert absorbent such as kieselguhr (a diatomaceous earth – a geological material 
produced by the sedimentary deposition of diatoms’ skeletons) to form dynamite 
(known as straight dynamite in the United States).
 
Explosions due to chemical reactions can be subdivided into two types, namely 
deflagrations and detonations. During a deflagration, the speed at which the 
reaction front moves through the explosive is less than the speed of sound in that 
material. In a detonation, the speed at which the reaction front moves through the 
explosive is greater than the speed of sound in that material.
 
High explosives are ones that normally detonate, and thereby produce a 
shattering effect. They are used in both military and industrial applications where 
blast is required. High explosives do not normally need to be confined in a container 
in order to explode. However, a number of military munitions are normally filled 
with this type of explosive, including shells, mines, bombs and grenades. When they 
explode, such munitions produce both blast and rapidly moving fragments of their 
casings. PETN- and RDX-based formulations are commonly used in military blasting 
applications. Frequently encountered industrial blasting formulations may be based 
on ammonium nitrate and/or nitroglycerine. These include ANFO and dynamite 
(both described earlier) and blends based on mixtures of either nitroglycerine 
and nitrocellulose, or nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose and ammonium nitrate. 
Unsurprisingly, high explosives are also called detonating explosives.
 
Deflagrating explosives (formerly known also as low explosives) are those that will 
not normally detonate. Furthermore, in order to explode – rather than burn – they 
need to be confined or contained. Also, when they do explode, their action is better 
described as pushing rather than shattering. Nonetheless, as illustrated by the example 
shown in Figure 11.1, their action can be devastating. Examples of such explosives 
include the propellants used in firearms (Chapter 9) and explosive mixtures of air and 
fuel gases (e.g. natural gas or petrol vapour) or flammable dusts (e.g. flour or coal).

explosion in which

the reaction front

In many applications, a distinction can be drawn between primary and secondary 
explosives. In such applications, the former of these materials is significantly more 
easy to initiate than the latter. The devices used in these applications contain a 
small amount of primary explosive and a main charge consisting of a larger quantity 
of secondary explosive. During use, initiation of the primary explosive liberates a 
sudden burst of energy that is sufficient to initiate a reaction in the main charge. 
This arrangement is used in firearms cartridges in which a percussion-initiated 
primary explosive (the primer) is used to set off the main charge (the propellant) 
(Chapter 9). It is also used in devices in which a main charge of high explosive 
(secondary explosive) is initiated with a detonator, which contains primary explosive.
 
It is also useful to recognise a distinction between condensed explosives and 
dispersed explosives. This is described in Box 11.1 together with the patterns of 
damage caused by an explosive that indicate which of these two forms was involved in 
a given incident and whether a detonation or a deflagration had occurred.
Liquid and solid explosives are both referred to as 
condensed; an explosive that is either a gas or an 
aerosol is described as being dispersed. (An aerosol is 
a solid or liquid that is finely dispersed in a gas, such 
as flour (a solid) in air (a gas).) Both detonations and 
deflagrations can occur in explosives of either type, 
although detonations are rare in dispersed explosives. 
importantly, as outlined in table 11.1, the patterns 
of damage resulting from an explosion give strong 
indications as to whether the explosive was condensed 
or dispersed and whether it detonated or deflagrated.
 
terrorists have been known to use a small charge 
of high explosive to disperse and ignite a quantity of 
flammable liquid (e.g. petrol). As might be expected, 
the aftermath of an explosion caused by such a device 
will show the characteristics of both the detonation 
of the condensed high explosive and the deflagration  
of the  dispersed material. in such cases, the effects of 
the detonation are most evident near to the location  
of the device at the time at which it exploded, while the 
characteristic damage caused by the deflagration is more 
clearly observed further away from this point. note that 
the explosion of such devices is likely to also result in a 
fire, which will cause its own pattern of damage. fires 
and the damage they cause are explored in chapter 10.

expLosion scene investigAtion n 357
11.2 Explosion scene investigation
The investigation of the scene of an explosion has, in most cases, the potential to 
become the investigation of the scene of a serious crime. Consequently, until and 
unless there is a reason to treat it otherwise, it is wise to process the scene of an 
explosion as if it were that of a serious crime. The methods used in the processing 
of serious crime scenes, and the underlying principles on which these methods are 
based, are described in detail in Chapter 2.
 
Nevertheless, explosion scene investigations differ from those of other scenes in a 
number of important respects. These principally arise out of:
n the unusual risks to the investigators, the emergency services and the public 
that are frequently posed by explosion scenes (although it should be noted 
that fires and other large scenes often also pose significant risks);
n the immense destruction that is often wrought by an explosion and any 
subsequent fire;
n the need to establish the cause of the explosion (i.e. what exploded and why 
it did so).
The principles, methods and management structures used to examine an explosion 
scene are, in essence, the same as those used to process any other major crime 
scene. As is the case with all major crime scenes, the management system 
incorporates mechanisms to allow experts to be called to the scene of an explosion 
as required. In the UK, in cases in which an explosive device may have been 
responsible for the explosion, the scene will be attended by both the emergency 
services and Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD, i.e. Army Bomb Disposal) 
personnel. Furthermore, in cases in which a terrorist organisation is suspected of 
involvement, the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch will normally be asked 
to assist the local police force in the processing of the scene.
 
Irrespective of the likely cause of the explosion, the preservation of life and the 
maintenance of safety are of paramount importance and there are systems in place 
to facilitate this. For example, in scenes that may involve explosive device(s), the 
site is not entered for the purposes of examination until it is declared safe by EOD 
personnel. Whether or not the explosion is suspected to have been caused by an 
explosive device, it is highly likely that an explosives expert will be called to attend 
the scene. His or her aim is to establish the cause of the explosion. However, he or 
she may also be called upon to assist the emergency services and/or military in the 
minimisation of the risk of subsequent explosions.
 
At some point, it will be necessary to approach the explosion scene for the 
first time. This will normally be part of the emergency response process in a bid 
to rescue any injured people from the devastation. However, if it is known beyond 
doubt that there are no injured persons present, this approach will be made part 
of the more controlled process of explosion investigation. When approaching the 
scene, it is vitally important to take into account the risks posed by the scene itself 
and any rescue operations to the health and safety of all those involved. These risks 
may arise as a consequence of damage caused by the explosion and could include, 
for example, the exposure of hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos, body fluids), the 

 
 358 n expLosions AnD expLosives
presence of potentially explosive gases or structures in imminent danger of collapse. 
In the case of deliberate bombings, extreme caution must be exercised in case 
another bomb has been placed nearby with the express purpose of killing or injuring 
those who respond to the first explosion.
 
As is the case for all crime scenes, the recording of the scene is of great 
importance (Chapter 2, Section 2.3). As part of this, all actions carried out at 
the scene should be properly logged from the earliest opportunity. Also, the 
establishment of a cordon around the scene of an explosion is a vital early step in its 
preservation. The debris from the explosion may be of great forensic significance. 
This is especially true of debris from any explosive device involved (Box 11.2). The 
violent and destructive nature of an explosion means that debris is likely to be 
scattered over a large area and evidentially significant pieces of material may be 
very small compared with the scale of the scene. On initial arrival at the scene, it 
may not be possible to be certain how far evidentially valuable material has been 
scattered from the location of the explosion. However, it is usually sufficient to 
place the cordon so that it has a radius from this location that is 1.5 times the 
distance travelled by the furthest flung piece of obvious debris. It must be borne in 
mind, however, that this may not be sufficient to encircle all significant items in all 
cases. For example, end caps from pipe bombs have been known to be blown for very 
considerable distances from the location of the explosion.
 
Once the cordon has been established, it is used to control access to the 
scene. After any emergencies created by the explosion have been brought under 
control, including those associated with any injured, those steps in addition to 
the placement of the cordon that are necessary to preserve the scene are carried 
out (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). The scene is then systematically searched for items 
of physical evidence and examined for features, such as patterns of damage (Box 
11.3), that may help to reconstruct the events of the incident and establish the 
cause of the explosion. Other than debris that originates from the explosive device 
the debris from any explosive device may include 
portions of any detonator employed, the wrappings 
from cartridges of commercial explosive (if used), and/
or fragments of any electrical or mechanical timing 
devices, remote control or victim-actuated mechanism 
present. the examination of such fragments may reveal a 
number of valuable facts. importantly, it may allow:
n the materials from which the explosive device was 
made to be identified (e.g. the laboratory analysis 
for trace levels of explosive not consumed in the 
incident can reveal the nature of the explosives 
involved, as may the presence of trade marks on 
wrappings);
n the construction of the device to be deduced;
n the likely manner in which it was triggered to be 
established;
n in some cases, the likely identity of one or 
more people involved in the incident (e.g. from 
fingerprints found on one of the device’s component 
parts, such as sticky tape used to hold it together).

itself and any container that was used to conceal it, the types of physical evidence 
that are sought are essentially the same as those looked for at any serious crime 
scene. Such evidence may include both recoverable materials (e.g. body fluids) and 
marks and impressions (e.g. footprints). For more information on the search for 
items of physical evidence, and their collection, packaging, labelling and storage, 
see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.
 
In order to fully investigate the cause of an explosion, it is necessary to draw upon 
all the relevant information available. This will include not only observations made 
at the scene but also the results of any laboratory analyses undertaken (Section 
11.3), interviews with witnesses and/or suspects, discussions with other personnel 
explosions due to explosives cause damage by 
displacing and permanently distorting objects as well 
as by the heat that they release and the fires that may 
follow. At the scene of an explosion, the analysis of 
the patterns of damage can be highly informative. A 
number of features of the damage are of value. notably, 
these include those that provide indications of:
n the direction in which the blast and/or fragments 
travelled at any given point in the scene (an example 
of the former type of feature is the bending of a pipe, 
while an example of the latter is the penetration of a 
relatively soft material by a fragment of bomb casing, 
thereby leaving an elongated hole – extrapolation 
from this would allow the direction of travel of the 
fragment to be established);
n the location of the region of maximum damage;
n the maximum pressure that was exerted by the 
explosion at various points in the scene.
the construction of a plan of the scene on which 
direction indicators are marked will frequently allow 
the investigator to establish the location of the place 
where the explosion started, that is the explosion 
centre. this is possible because the explosion centre 
will be revealed as the place from which blast and/or 
fragments of any explosive device originated. Locating 
the explosion centre is of considerable value because:
n it will coincide with the place where the explosion 
was initiated, thereby assisting the investigation by 
indicating where to look for evidence of the means 
by which initiation occurred;
n in cases that involve condensed explosives (Box 
11.1), the vicinity of the explosion centre is a likely 
place to find explosive residues in concentrations that 
may be detected by laboratory analysis (section 11.3);
n this is the origin of the trajectory taken by any 
fragments of any bomb involved (and/or any 
container used to conceal any bomb) thereby 
providing information about the likely location of 
such fragments;
n when used in conjunction with other observations 
based on patterns of damage, it will allow experts 
to discern strong indications as to whether a given 
chemical explosion was caused by a condensed 
explosive or a dispersed one, and whether this 
explosive detonated or deflagrated (see Box 11.1).
in the case of condensed explosives, one of the 
parameters that may be estimated from an analysis 
of damage patterns is the weight of the charge. there 
are a number of ways in which this may be done. for 
example, for all but small charges, crater dimensions 
can be used, thus:
 
d3
W ≈ ––
 
16
where W is the weight of the charge in kilograms and d 
is the diameter of the crater in metres.

attending the scene (such as members of the emergency services) and those with 
specialist knowledge of the location (such as the architects and the owners of 
property that was damaged), and information available from an examination of any 
injuries sustained by individuals during the explosion.
 
The investigation of an explosion will normally allow a number of conclusions 
to be drawn, although the degree of certainty associated with these may vary 
from conclusion to conclusion and from incident to incident. Importantly, these 
conclusions will normally include an assessment of whether the explosion occurred 
as the result of an accident or a deliberate act and the type of explosion involved (i.e. 
chemical, mechanical, thermal, electrical or nuclear). In instances of explosions 
caused by chemical reactions, on which this chapter concentrates, the investigation 
will normally reveal whether the explosive was condensed or dispersed and whether 
it deflagrated or detonated (Box 11.1). Furthermore, in such cases, strenuous 
efforts will be made to establish the exact chemical nature of the explosive, the 
means by which it was initiated and, in the case of a deliberately caused explosion, 
the motives, modus operandi and identity of the person or persons responsible.
 
Note that the process of elimination is an important tool in the investigation of 
explosions as it can reveal truths that are not directly observable. For example, if 
all natural and accidental causes of an explosion can be eliminated, then it must be 
concluded that the explosion occurred as the result of a deliberate act.
 
It is important to realise that some explosion scenes are not what they first 
appear to be. For example, if an explosion were to occur on board an aeroplane, 
causing it to crash to the ground, then the enormous damage of the impact may 
initially disguise damage caused by the explosion. Under these circumstances, 
unless sufficient pains are taken during the crash investigation, its true root cause 
may never be established. This point is illustrated by the enormous effort that 
was necessary to establish the cause of the Lockerbie disaster, as described in the 
case study given in Box 11.4. This case study also illustrates the importance of the 
process of elimination in explosion scene investigations.
on 21 December 1988 at 7.03 p.m. gMt, the Boeing 
747 aeroplane (registration n739pA) that was pan Am 
flight 103 fell from the sky, disintegrating as it did so. 
there had been no distress call from the aeroplane, 
which had been heading for new York, having taken 
off from London en route from frankfurt. Large parts 
of it crashed to the ground in and around Lockerbie, 
a small town in Dumfries and galloway, scotland, with 
debris scattered over an area of land of approximately 
845 square miles (2190 km2). All 259 people on 
board the flight and a further 11 on the ground were 
killed during this tragedy. the financial costs were 
considerable too, including approximately £17 million 
spent on aftermath operations, including police 
inquiries, and the cost of the aircraft (its insurance 
hull value amounted to approximately Us$32 million).
 
the post-crash operations were extensive and 
complex. they involved many organisations, including 
the fire Brigade, police, British Air Accidents 
investigation Branch (AAiB), the Army, Royal Air

11.3 The analysis of explosives
Laboratory-based chemical analysis of samples connected with cases of suspected 
illegal use of explosives can provide valuable evidence. Such samples may be those 
recovered from the scene of an explosion (whether actual or apparently intended), 
any suspects involved in the case and/or their possessions.
 
The initial purpose of such analysis is to establish whether the sample contains 
an explosive. Furthermore, laboratory analysis may identify the chemical nature of 
any explosive detected. It may also allow the amount of any such material present in 
the sample to be established and/or provide points of comparison between samples 
taken from different locations. The last of these may be of particular importance 
in helping to establish a link between a suspect and an apparent crime scene or 
between a number of seemingly independent incidents.
 
During chemical analysis, a distinction must be made between trace and bulk 
quantities of questioned material. Strictly, bulk quantities are those that may be 
weighed. However, as a rule of thumb, trace quantities are those that are too small 
force and navy in the UK, and many agencies from 
other nations – including the Us federal Bureau of 
investigation (fBi). to give an indication of the scale 
of work undertaken, it is worth noting that within 1 
week of the crash, more than 5000 UK police officers 
had been involved.
 
As a result of the painstaking search of land on both 
sides of the border between england and scotland, in 
excess of 4 million individual pieces of debris were 
located. More than 85 per cent of the structural parts 
of the aeroplane were retrieved. this enabled the 
investigators to physically reconstruct the Boeing 747 
inside a large hangar. examination of the wreckage 
revealed no indication that corrosion or fatigue of 
the aircraft had caused its failure. What is more, the 
aeroplane’s flight recorder demonstrated that, at the 
time when disaster struck, its controls had been at 
appropriate settings for normal flight.
 
close inspection of the wreckage revealed evidence 
of the detonation of an explosive device within one 
of the containers in which luggage had been stored 
within the forward baggage hold. Key aspects of this 
evidence included:
n the presence of trace levels of explosives;
n minute fragments embedded in the skin of the 
aircraft and container parts – including a small piece 
of printed circuit board that could be identified as 
having come from a radio-cassette player that had 
been used to conceal the explosive device;
n fibres indicating that a brown suitcase had 
contained the bomb together with clothing.
A range of simulation experiments were carried out in 
which explosive devices were detonated within luggage 
containers of the type in which the bomb was thought 
to have exploded. these demonstrated that the 
detonation was likely to have occurred in a position 
within the container that indicated that the bomb had 
been loaded onto the aeroplane at frankfurt.
 
textile fibres recovered from pieces of the suitcase 
believed to have held the explosive device were traced 
to clothing that had been flown to frankfurt from Malta. 
During a trial held under scottish law in camp Zeist, 
the netherlands, a Libyan, Abdel Baset Ali Mohamed 
Al-Megrahi, was shown to have purchased these clothes 
from a boutique in Malta. on 31 January 2001, he was 
found guilty and convicted of the bombing of pan Am 
flight 103 and given a life sentence. on 24 november 
2003, three judges ruled that he must serve a minimum 
of 27 years in jail before being considered for parole.
 
on 20 August 2009, Al-Megrahi was released from 
prison on compassionate grounds by the scottish 
executive.

to be seen with the naked eye and, conversely, anything that can be seen under 
these conditions is considered as being present in bulk amounts. Examples of trace 
quantities include the explosive residues that may be recovered from a suspect’s 
hands after he or she has handled explosives.
 
This distinction between trace and bulk amounts of questioned material is 
important for a number of reasons. These include the potential that bulk samples 
have for contaminating items that are suspected of containing trace quantities of 
incriminating material. It is vital, therefore, that rigorous systems are in place to 
ensure that such items can never be brought into direct contact with bulk samples 
or with surfaces that have been potentially contaminated by contact with bulk 
samples. For example, it is good practice to completely separate those facilities that 
handle and analyse bulk explosives from those that deal with trace samples. In the 
case of explosives, another reason for this distinction is that great safety precautions 
need to be taken during the analysis of substantial bulk samples because of both the 
explosion hazard that they pose and, in many cases, their toxic nature.
 
A wide range of techniques may be used for the analysis of samples that are 
suspected of being composed of, or contaminated with, explosives. These include:
n the physical testing of the explosive properties of the sample;
n spot tests (i.e. chemical tests devised to produce visible changes in the 
presence of small amounts of specific types of chemical and that may indicate 
the presence of an explosive);
n light and scanning electron microscopy (the latter of which can be coupled 
with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), allowing the determination of 
the elemental composition of the sample (Chapter 9, Box 9.7));
n infrared spectroscopy – a technique that can allow the detection of the presence 
of individual chemical species or chemical functional groups, and that provides 
multiple points of comparison between samples (Chapter 3, Box 3.10);
n various forms of chromatography (Box 11.5), including:
– 
thin-layer chromatography (TLC);
– 
gas chromatography (GC) (which may be linked to mass spectrometry 
(MS) to give GC–MS);
– 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); and
– 
ion chromatography (IC);
n atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) – a technique that can be used to 
quantify most elements that may be present in a sample (Chapter 7, Box 7.5).
The methods that are selected for a given application will depend on a number of 
factors. Notably, these include:
n whether the sample is believed to contain bulk or trace amounts of explosive 
(e.g. the physical testing of the sample’s explosive properties can be carried 
out only on bulk samples);

 
the AnALYsis of expLosives n 363
the term chromatography is applied to any analytical 
technique that is used to separate the components of 
mixtures by means of a system containing both a mobile 
phase and a stationary phase. the mobile phase employed 
is a gas, liquid or, less commonly, a supercritical fluid. 
the stationary phase may be a solid (usually finely 
divided), a liquid immobilised onto a solid or a chemical 
species bonded to a solid. essentially, the mixture under 
test is carried through or over the stationary phase by 
the one-way flow of the mobile phase. separation is 
possible if the molecules, atoms or ions that make up 
the different components of the mixture spend different 
proportions of their time in the mobile phase. this is 
because the more time that a component’s molecules, 
atoms or ions spend in the mobile phase, the faster the 
component will migrate through the stationary phase and 
the components of the mixture will separate if they have 
differential migration rates.
 
there are many different chromatographic systems 
available. the methods used may be classified as either 
planar chromatography or column chromatography. 
in the former, the stationary phase is held within 
the pores of a piece of paper or onto a flat plate. in 
column chromatography, the mobile phase is made 
to flow, either by gravity or by pressure, through a 
stationary phase held in a column or thin tube.
 
the main chromatographic methods used in forensic 
analysis are each examined in turn.
Thin-layer chromatography
thin-layer chromatography (tLc) is an example of planar 
chromatography. in this system, the stationary phase 
is provided by a thin layer of an appropriate material, 
such as finely divided silica or alumina, bound onto a 
flat plate, typically made of plastic or glass. the sample 
under test is applied as a spot near to the bottom of the 
plate in a position marked with pencil (the origin). in the 
most common variant of this technique, the plate is then 
placed roughly vertically in a closed tank that contains a 
shallow pool of liquid (the mobile phase, known as the 
solvent or the developer). importantly, the solvent pool 
is not so deep that it comes into direct contact with the 
sample spot. As the solvent gradually rises through the 
stationary phase by capillary action, the components 
of the sample become separated. this process is called 
development. After separation, but before the solvent 
has reached the top of the plate, the plate is taken out 
of the developing tank. the position of the boundary 
between the wet and dry portions of the plate (i.e. the 
solvent front) is marked with pencil and the plate is then 
dried. the separated components of the mixture appear 
as individual spots on this record of chromatography 
(known as a chromatogram). if necessary, these spots 
are made visible (i.e. visualised), for example, by using 
an appropriate chemical treatment or by fluorescence 
examination under ultraviolet light.
 
tLc cannot provide definitive proof of the identity of a 
given sample or its constituent component(s). however, 
in forensic analysis, it can be used to compare questioned 
samples with known standards (i.e. positive control 
samples) and thereby facilitate tentative identification. 
this is best done by placing the questioned sample and 
the standard on the same tLc plate, and then subjecting 
both of them to identical treatment. if the questioned 
sample and the standard behave indistinguishably when 
developed and, where needs be, visualised, this is 
evidence that they may be the same material. figure 8.3 
in chapter 8 gives an example of this type of experiment, 
as applied to the analysis of ink.
 
tLc can be used to provide tentative identification 
of the compound(s) present in a questioned sample. in 
many applications, it is not practicable to place all of the 
possible compounds that might be in a given questioned 
sample on the same tLc plate as the sample itself. 
fortunately, information that can narrow down the range 
of possible compounds can be derived from an initial tLc 
experiment. this is performed on a plate on which only 
the questioned sample is placed. from this, the retard-
ation factor (Rf) of the component(s) of the sample can 
be determined using the following expression:
 
distance travelled by the component
Rf = –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

provided that the same type of tLc plate is used and 
that it is developed under the same conditions, the Rf 
value of a given compound is essentially constant. this 
means that the Rf value(s) obtained from this initial 
experiment can be compared with tabulated Rf values 
to find compounds with similar or identical Rf values 
to those of the questioned sample’s component(s). in 
a second experiment, these compounds can be placed 
on the same tLc plate as the questioned sample, 
thereby allowing direct comparison after development 
and, if required, visualisation. figure 7.9 (chapter 7) 
illustrates the calculation of Rf values for two drugs.
 
in addition to the analysis of inks, and drugs and 
other poisons, tLc can be used in forensic science to 
analyse fibres (chapter 3, section 3.1.2) and explosives 
(section 11.3).
High-performance liquid chromatography
high-performance liquid chromatography (hpLc) 
is an advanced type of column chromatography in 
which a liquid mobile phase is pumped under pressure 
through a column packed with a stationary phase. this 
stationary phase is made up of tiny solid particles, 
in many cases coated with an immobilised organic 
material. Briefly, the sample under test is injected 
into the column at one end and carried by a suitable 
liquid through the solid matrix. separation of its 
constituent components occurs and, as they exit the 
column at the other end, they are detected one at a 
time by the use of a suitable detector (commonly 
based on fluorescence or the absorption of ultraviolet 
light). A record is made of the retention time of each 
component; that is, the time that each one spends in 
the column. these retention times are then compared 
with those of standard compounds in order to establish 
the likely identity of the components of the sample.
 
in common with tLc, this type of chromatography 
does not definitively prove the identity of the sample 
under test. however, proof of identity may be enhanced 
by the incorporation of a diode array detector (DAD). 
this simultaneously detects and records the ultraviolet–
visible absorption spectrum of any component that 
absorbs in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
it thereby simultaneously provides two different 
characteristics (the retention time and the absorption 
spectrum) that can be used when comparing an 
unknown component of a sample with a standard. 
 
hpLc is performed at, or near, room temperature, 
which means that it is suitable for compounds that are 
sensitive to high temperatures. in forensic analysis, 
it can be used in the separation of complex mixtures 
of drugs (chapter 7, section 7.5.3), inks (chapter 8, 
section 8.5) and explosives (section 11.3).
 
ion chromatography (ic) is a technique that can be 
used to separate and quantify mixtures of either cations 
(i.e. positively charged ions) or anions (i.e. negatively 
charged ions). in the former case, the stationary phase 
is a cation exchange resin, while in the latter it is an 
anion exchange resin. in both cases, the stationary 
phase, in the form of tiny beads, is held in a column. 
the mobile phase is an aqueous solution, commonly 
of either dilute acid (in the separation of cations) or 
dilute base (in the separation of anions) and detection 
is usually by conductivity. in most applications, the 
mobile phase is pumped through the column. therefore, 
in such cases, ic is considered as a type of hpLc.
Gas chromatography 
gas chromatography (gc) is another example of column 
chromatography. in gc, the mobile phase that carries 
the sample is a gas, usually nitrogen or helium, known 
as the carrier gas. While in some applications the 
stationary phase is a solid, this is rare. the norm is for 
the stationary phase to be a thin film of liquid that is 
immobilised within the column, and it is this variant of 
gc that is described here.
 
there are two main types of gc apparatus used with 
immobilised liquid stationary phases:
n Packed columns. these are made of metal, glass 
or teflon. they are typically 1–6 m long and have 
inside diameters of 2–4 mm. packed columns are 
filled with a finely divided, inert packing material, 
commonly diatomaceous earth. the surface of this 
solid support retains the thin film of liquid that 
constitutes the stationary phase.
n Capillary columns (also known as open tubular 
columns). capillary columns may be made of glass 
or, more recently, of fused silica, and are coiled. 
they range in length from 10 to 100 m and have 
inside diameters of 0.1–0.75 mm. in capillary 
columns, the inside wall of the tube is directly 
coated with the liquid stationary phase.

n the nature of the explosive material that is suspected to be present (e.g. if it 
is believed that the material might contain an ionic oxidising agent, such as 
nitrate (NO3
–), ion chromatography might be employed, whereas if it were to 
contain a relatively volatile organic explosive compound (e.g. nitroglycerine) 
gas chromatography might be chosen);
n the sample matrix within which it is believed that explosive may be found (e.g. 
if the matrix is soil dug from the crater left by a bomb, it is likely that some 
form of sample pre-treatment – designed to largely separate any explosive 
present from its original matrix – will be used prior to the application of the 
main analytical technique(s)).
A range of methods based on GC and HPLC has been devised for the analysis of 
explosive compounds such as nitroglycerine or PETN. Given the superb sensitivity 
that may be achieved by these techniques, they are the methods of choice for the 
analysis of such compounds at trace levels.
 
When carrying out the laboratory analysis of samples that are suspected of 
containing explosives, the parallel analysis of appropriate control samples may be 
of utmost importance. In this context, the control samples chosen will be ones 
intended to either:
n replicate the matrix within which the explosive is believed to reside in the 
questioned samples; and/or
 
in gc, the sample is injected, usually in liquid form, 
into a heated injection chamber where it is vaporised 
(unless it is injected as a gas) and carried by the mobile 
phase through the heated column containing the 
stationary phase. the components of the sample mixture 
are separated according to their relative affinities for the 
mobile and stationary phases. As each emerges from the 
column, it is detected by, for example, a flame ionisation 
detector (fiD) and recorded as a chromatogram that is 
a plot of retention time (on the horizontal axis) against 
detector response (examples of such chromatograms are 
given in figure 10.9, chapter 10). 
 
in gc, the retention time for each individual 
component of a sample mixture is the time taken 
from initial injection to emergence from the column. 
these retention times can be compared with those of 
known standards, allowing tentative identification 
of the components. Definitive proof of component 
identity can be achieved, however, by using one of the 
‘hyphenated techniques’, usually gas chromatography–
mass spectrometry (gc–Ms). gc–Ms is used to confirm 
the analysis, for example, of banned substances in 
body fluids after immunoassay (chapter 7, section 
7.5.3) and of explosive compounds present in samples 
at trace levels (section 11.3).
 
it should be noted that it is possible to obtain 
quantitative, as well as qualitative, information from 
gc chromatograms. this can be done because the area 
under each peak is proportional to the amount of the 
component concerned that is present in the sample.
 
finally, a special type of gc, known as pyrolysis-gas 
chromatography, is worthy of mention. this is used 
to obtain information about samples of low volatility. 
in pyrolysis-gc, the sample under test is broken 
down into various gaseous products by heating it to 
extremely high temperatures (up to 1000 °c), before 
the gases are entered into the mobile gas phase of the 
gc column. in forensic analysis, pyrolysis-gc may be 
used, for example, to characterise man-made fibres and 
paints (chapter 3, sections 3.1.2 and 3.5 respectively).

n check that the environment from which the questioned samples were 
taken, or in which they were stored or handled, could not produce a false- 
positive result.
For example, consider a case in which swabs were used to take samples from the 
hands of someone suspected of handling explosives. If these were analysed and 
shown to contain traces of explosive and the case were to go to court, defence 
lawyers could argue that the traces of explosive could have arisen because of 
contamination from:
n the swabs themselves;
n any solvents or reagents used to damp the swabs prior to their contact with 
the hands of the suspect or during the subsequent processing of the swabs; 
and/or
n any surfaces (laboratory bench tops, the gloves worn by the analyst, etc.) with 
which the swabs could have been brought into contact during their processing.
 
However, the defence’s argument could be shown to be invalid if the laboratory 
had also:
n analysed the following control samples:
– swabs that were identical in all respects (including being damped with 
any solvent or reagent employed) to those used to take samples from the 
suspect except that they had not been in contact with the suspect’s hands; 
and
– swabs taken from all surfaces from which contamination could have 
occurred;
n carried out this analysis of control samples, using techniques, solvents, 
reagents and equipment identical to those used for the questioned samples, 
and by this means established that none of the control samples showed any 
traces of the explosive found in the questioned samples.
It is vitally important to realise that analytical data that show the presence of 
explosive material are not in themselves proof that a crime has been committed nor 
are they proof that a given individual participated in a proven crime. For example, 
explosives may be found on farmland because that land had previously been used as 
part of a military firing range. In a similar vein, seemingly incriminating traces of 
explosive may be innocently present on the hands of an individual. This may occur, 
for example, either because he or she had encountered such material as part of his 
or her work (e.g. as a quarry worker or a member of the armed forces) or because 
that person had shaken hands with someone who had recently handled explosives. 
Also, apparently incriminating chemicals that may be part of an explosive 
formulation often have other legitimate uses (e.g. ammonium nitrate is both a 
component of the explosive ANFO and used as a plant fertiliser).

Problems
1. Consider a case in which an explosion occurred immediately after a fire-
fighter broke a window of a room in a burning house. List the possible causes 
of such an explosion. Decide which of the causes on your list you believe to 
be the most probable explanation of what happened. Describe the evidence 
that would be collected by an explosion scene investigator in order to test 
whether this cause does indeed explain the occurrence of the explosion. 
Before answering this question, you may find it useful to read Chapter 10.
2. During an explosion scene investigation, it is of great importance to be able 
to establish whether the explosion was deliberate or accidental. Discuss 
the features of a scene that would indicate to you that it was the scene of a 
deliberate explosion and how these features would contrast with those that 
may be observed at the scene of an accidental explosion.
3. When collecting, storing and transporting samples from explosion scenes for 
subsequent laboratory-based forensic analysis, what steps would you take to 
ensure that:
(a) adequate control samples are taken;
(b) all samples can be uniquely identified; and
(c) contamination of the samples cannot occur?
 
Note that before answering this question, you might find it useful to read 
Chapter 2.
4. Review the means by which crime scenes are preserved and recorded and the 
methods used to recover items of physical evidence from them (see Chapter 
2). Describe any specific issues that may need to be addressed when applying 
these means and methods to explosion scenes.
n An explosion is the violent effect produced due to the 
rapid build-up of gas pressure at a location because of the 
sudden liberation of energy and, in most cases, gas at that 
location. in the forensic context, the most important type 
of explosion is one produced by a chemical explosive. such 
explosives may be formed by the combination of suitable 
oxidising and reducing agents in appropriate proportions.
n explosions may be divided into those that are deflagrations 
and those that are detonations. high explosives are those 
that normally detonate when they explode, whereas 
deflagrating explosives will not ordinarily do so. An explosive 
device will often be constructed using a small amount of 
relatively easily initiated primary explosive, the explosion of 
which is designed to set off a larger charge of a secondary 
explosive. explosives may be classified on the basis of their 
physical form: condensed explosives are solids or liquids, 
while explosive gases and aerosols are said to be dispersed.
n Many of the principles and methods used in the 
investigation of an explosion scene are those employed 
during the processing of any serious crime scene. however, 
explosion scene investigation differs from normal serious 
crime scene investigation to allow for the unusual risks 
posed by the aftermath of an explosion, the immense 
destruction that often accompanies an explosion and the 
need to establish the cause of the explosion.
n A wide range of laboratory-based analytical techniques 
can be used to detect, identify and/or quantify explosive 
materials, whether present in bulk or trace amounts. the 
information provided may be of value, for example, in 
establishing a link between a suspect and an apparent crime 
scene. When analysing samples for trace levels of explosive, 
great care has to be taken to avoid the possibility of 
contamination. Appropriate control samples must be used 
to show that such contamination has not occurred.

Introduction
This chapter begins with a description of the methods used in the location, 
excavation and recovery of buried human remains and the key role played by the 
forensic archaeologist in this process (Section 12.1). In all cases where the death 
of an individual cannot be attributed to natural causes, further investigation into 
the death, and the circumstances surrounding it, is required. This will often involve 
a medico-legal post-mortem examination, carried out by a forensic pathologist. 
While most of the post-mortem will be carried out at the mortuary, the forensic

pathologist will usually begin his or her work at the crime scene itself, examining the 
body in situ. In the case of buried remains, the forensic pathologist is normally called 
in at the stage where the body is fully uncovered within its grave by the removal of 
the overlying infill. He or she may liaise with the forensic archaeologist over the best 
way to recover the body without causing any further trauma. If the body has largely 
or completely decomposed to reveal the bony skeleton, the forensic pathologist may 
request the assistance of another specialist, the forensic anthropologist.
 
The purpose of the post-mortem examination is to establish a number of relevant 
facts. Importantly, these include the time of death (Section 12.2), the cause of death 
(Section 12.4) and the identification of the deceased (Section 12.5). These topics, 
along with a discussion of the natural process of post-mortem decomposition (Section 
12.3), form the remainder of this chapter. The forensic examination of evidential 
items that may be found in association with human remains, such as fibres and body 
fluids, is dealt with elsewhere in this book (particularly in Chapters 3 and 5).
12.1 The role of the forensic 
 
archaeologist in the location, 
 
excavation and recovery of 
 
human remains
It is only since the mid-1980s that the potential value of involving a forensic 
archaeologist in the investigation of certain serious crimes has been recognised. 
Using familiar techniques from the traditional discipline of archaeology, the 
forensic archaeologist can advise and offer practical assistance to the police in the 
location, excavation and recovery of human remains.
12.1.1  The search for human remains
In some cases, the location of the remains of the victim(s) of serious crimes is 
unknown to the police. It is at this early stage of the investigation that the forensic 
archaeologist may be called in to assist. The search techniques presented below 
progress from non-invasive methods to those of a more destructive nature. Clearly, 
the order in which they are applied in the field is of great importance in maintaining 
the integrity of any forensic evidence and maximising the chances of its recovery. 
Maps and aerial photographs
Maps of various types constitute an important initial resource in the selection 
and delimitation of a search area. In the UK, the Ordnance Survey produces maps 
on a number of different scales, for example 1:25 000 and 1:10 000. The largest-
scale map, 1:1250, is particularly useful for built-up areas. Geological maps 
and those that show land use, both past and present, may also be of significant 
value. For example, an area in which the underlying rock is close to the surface, 
perhaps breaking through the surface in the form of outcrops, may be eliminated 
as a potential burial site, whereas an area of deep deposits, for example of alluvial 
material in a river valley, looks more favourable.

Aerial photographs may be important in pinpointing anomalies in topography or 
vegetation on the ground, which may be of potential interest to an investigation. 
For example, the presence of unusually lush vegetation may indicate the presence 
of a grave or pit (due to elevated moisture levels in the ground) while parch marks 
may be due to the presence of solid obstructions beneath the ground (preventing 
the overlying vegetation from accessing adequate water). Moreover, changes in 
vegetation over time may be apparent if aerial photographs taken at an earlier date, 
or dates, are available for a particular area of interest, and these too may warrant 
further investigation. Taken from an elevated position, a photograph’s success in 
showing contrast between an anomalous feature and its surroundings will depend 
on a number of factors. These include the angle at which the photograph is taken, 
and the relative position of the Sun and its effect on shadowing on the ground. 
Ground-based visual searches 
Once an area of potential interest has been identified, a visual search on foot can 
be instigated. This is best carried out by skilled observers but volunteers may be 
brought in to swell the ranks. The area is usually subdivided into smaller patches, 
using natural and human-made boundaries, and then systematically searched using 
the most appropriate search pattern(s), for example a strip, grid or circular pattern 
(Chapter 2, Figure 2.9). 
 
Visual searches should be able to reveal the location of any surface deposits 
of human remains, for example, hidden under bushes or in hollows. However, it 
should be remembered that such remains may have been subsequently scattered by 
scavenging animals. In contrast, the search for hidden graves requires particularly 
skilled observation, with changes in topography and/or vegetation indicating 
the potential presence of burial sites. For example, a depression in the ground 
may be caused by settling down of the infill material covering a body and/or the 
decomposition of the corpse underneath. In contrast, the presence of a grave may 
be indicated by a raised feature, particularly when the burial is a recent one. This 
occurs where it has been necessary to dispose of an excessive amount of excavated 
soil (‘spoil’) after the body has been buried. Also, differences in the type, species 
composition and growth habit of plants may be noted. For example, vegetation 
within a small area may be unexpectedly lush due to the release of nutrients from a 
body decomposing in the ground below it. 
 
Although ground-based visual searches are essentially non-invasive, fieldworkers 
need to be aware at all times of their physical impact on an area, in order to avoid 
or minimise any disturbance to potential evidence. It should be noted that, on 
occasion, searchers may make use of probes when combing a large area (see the 
section below on manual techniques).
Geophysical survey techniques
A geophysical survey is one in which spatial variations in certain physical properties 
of the ground are monitored to reveal information about the location of subsurface 
features. There are several geophysical survey methods that may be applied to the 
location of clandestine burial sites of forensic interest. The selection of the most 
suitable one(s) to use in a particular situation and its/their application requires 
the knowledge and expertise of the forensic geophysicist. In all cases, a geophysical 

 
 372 n thE REcOvERy AnD fOREnsic ExAminAtiOn Of hUmAn REmAins
survey would initially involve the establishment of a search pattern, usually a grid, 
on a suitable scale.
 
Geophysical survey techniques have several advantages. For example, they are 
usually non-invasive (or at least involve only minimal disturbance of the ground) and 
do not require a large input in terms of machinery and labour. They are divided into 
two basic types: active and passive. Active methods are those in which man-made 
signals are transmitted into the ground and any reflected signals subsequently 
measured. In contrast, passive geophysical survey techniques make measurements 
of natural signals originating from within the Earth itself. 
 
Three geophysical survey techniques are briefly discussed in turn below; the first 
two belong to the active group, while the last is a passive method. Some of their 
advantages and disadvantages, with reference to their forensic application, are given 
in Table 12.1. 
Ground-penetrating radar  Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) belongs to the 
group of active geophysical survey techniques. In GPR, the man-made signals are in 
the form of electromagnetic pulses, which are transmitted into the ground as the 
apparatus is systematically moved over the search area. When the pathway of these 
transmitted pulses is interrupted by the presence of an object, or objects, the pulses 
are reflected back to the surface and subsequently recorded. In this way, a map can 
be built up in real time of the subsurface features and any that are of particular 
interest can be investigated further by manual techniques (see section below). 
 
GPR is a non-invasive technique that has the distinct advantage of being able to 
visualise objects underneath dense materials such as concrete and tarmac. It therefore 
has potential use within the built environment (e.g. under pavements, patios and 
concrete floors). For example, in 1994, GPR was deployed in the search of 25 Cromwell 
Street, Gloucester, the home of Fred and Rosemary West. The remains of nine of their 
known murder victims were exhumed at the property. Six bodies were recovered from 
underneath the cellar, while a further three were found buried in the garden.
Electrical resistivity surveying  Like GPR, electrical resistivity surveying is an active 
geophysical survey technique. In this method, electrodes are placed into the ground 
at known distances apart and an electric current introduced. The current distributes 
itself through the ground. Measurements can then be recorded of the resistance 
to that current at various points underground. If the ground is homogeneous (i.e. 
of uniform resistivity), it is possible to predict the flow of the induced current. 
Therefore, any deviation from this predicted flow can be ascribed to the presence of 
an anomaly within the uniform background matrix. Such an aberration may take the 
form of a low-resistance anomaly or a high-resistance anomaly.
 
In the detection of potential burial sites, the resistance anomaly, if present, 
may be high or low, depending on a number of factors including the stage of 
decomposition of the body, the amount of groundwater present, and the presence 
or absence of air pockets. The situation therefore is a complex one. It should be 
noted that often the contrast in resistivity measurements between a grave and its 
surroundings will be insufficient to allow for the detection of the burial site.
Magnetic surveying  Unlike the two methods given above, magnetic surveying is a passive 
geophysical surveying technique. In magnetic surveying, measurements are made of 
the Earth’s magnetic field. The apparatus used is called a magnetometer (hence this 

 
thE ROlE Of thE fOREnsic ARchAEOlOgist n 373
technique may be referred to as magnetometry). There are several types commercially 
available, such as the proton magnetometer and the flux-gate magnetometer.
 
The application of this technique produces a contoured magnetic intensity map, on 
which areas of magnetic irregularity may be identifiable by a suitably skilled operator. 
Such anomalies may be of forensic interest. Although it is not possible to directly 
identify the presence of human remains by magnetometry, this technique should 
detect metallic objects, including weapons, which may be found in association with 
them. Magnetic surveying may also be successful in the location of fire residues.

Manual techniques The search techniques described above have been essentially 
non-invasive. However, once they have been successful in pinpointing a potential 
burial site, manual techniques, which by their very nature are destructive, usually 
constitute the next stage.
 
Of those available, ground probes are considered the least damaging of the 
manual techniques and therefore are usually applied first. The individuals carrying 
out a probe search are looking for differences in the ease with which a probe travels 
through the soil at various points. As well as being used within small gridded 
areas, probing may be applied in line searches sweeping larger expanses of terrain. 
In areas of disturbed ground, the probe should be able to penetrate more deeply 
and with greater ease. Importantly, great care must be taken not to pierce any 
remains concealed underneath. If probing indicates the possible site of a burial, 
tests to confirm the presence or absence of a body can then be carried out. These 
may involve making measurements of subsurface soil temperatures or soil pH, or 
the detection of combustible gas vapours given off by the decomposing corpse. In 
another approach, specially trained dogs, known as cadaver dogs, may be brought 
to vent holes created by probing to sniff out decomposition gases arising from 
buried human remains. 
 
If probing fails to locate a burial site, manual techniques that remove actual soil 
samples, such as the use of an auger, may be required. The use of such techniques 
is more destructive than probing but may reveal valuable information. For example, 
the extraction of an intact soil core might reveal mixing of the different soil 
horizons. Such disturbance of the naturally layered structure of the soil profile 
(Chapter 3, Section 3.3) may be due, for example, to the back-filling of a grave. 
12.1.2   Excavation of graves and the recovery of   
human remains
A potential burial site may be located as a result of deliberate search processes 
(outlined in Section 12.1.1 above) or its presence brought to the attention of 
the police by, for example, a concerned member of the public. At this stage, it 
constitutes a provisional crime scene, which is recorded in the usual manner by 
crime scene personnel (Chapter 2). As part of the team, the forensic archaeologist 
will play a key role, bringing valuable knowledge about the buried environment 
from the traditional discipline of archaeology to the ensuing investigation. Through 
excavating and recording the burial site in a controlled and systematic manner, 
the forensic archaeologist will be able to use his or her knowledge of stratigraphy 
to reconstruct the relative chronology of a grave (i.e. which layer was deposited 
first and which last). Moreover, he or she can advise on the use of absolute dating 
methods, such as lead isotope dating and radio carbon dating, where appropriate.
 
The initial assessment covers a wider area than just the suspected burial place, 
with the position of any evidential items recorded prior to removal and storage. 
Also, the digging of a small test pit in the surrounding area will provide useful 
information on local soil conditions. The next stage usually involves the excavation 
of a narrow trench, or sondage, (≤0.5 m wide) by the forensic archaeologist. This 
trench should be positioned across the area of interest and continue beyond it in 
Stratigraphy

order to identify any grave cut present (Figure 12.1). Starting with the vegetated 
surface, the trench is methodically excavated, with each sequential layer removed 
and preserved separately. If human remains are uncovered, the provisional crime 
scene becomes a scene of serious crime, with all that that entails (Chapter 2).
 
It is now necessary for the whole of the burial site to be excavated in order to 
expose the bodily remains fully. This is usually done in two stages by excavating 
first one-half and then the other down to the undisturbed layer (Figure 12.1). This 
process is known as half-sectioning. Obviously, excavation is a completely destructive 
process. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that it is carried out methodically, with 
each layer separately stored and exhibited for future sampling. The position of any 
noticeable marks (e.g. left by tools or footwear) or evidential items within the grave 
itself should be accurately recorded in order to help build up a three-dimensional 
model of the site. Part of the expertise of the forensic archaeologist will lie with his or 
her ability to recognise less obvious items of potential forensic interest, for example 
unusual soil features, insect remains, leaf mould and likely sources of pollen. Experts 
with specialist knowledge in a particular area may become involved, for example a 
forensic palynologist to examine pollen grains and spores (Chapter 3, Section 3.4). 
 
Once the body is exposed in situ as far as possible by the removal of infill, the 
degree to which post-mortem decomposition has taken place will be observable. This 
process is dependent on a number of factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic (Section 
12.3.1), and eventually leads to complete skeletalisation of the body (Section 12.3.2). 
If the body is approaching or has reached the skeleton stage (i.e. with only the bony 
framework remaining), a forensic anthropologist may be called in to assist.
 
The position of the body should be recorded as part of the documentation 
process. In primary burials, this may be classed as one of the following three types:

n extended (with 180° between the position of the legs and the trunk);
n semi-flexed (with an angle >90 ° but <180 ° between the legs and trunk); or
n flexed (with an angle ≤90 ° between the legs and the trunk).
Furthermore, the arrangement of the constituent bones in relation to each other 
is of potential importance. An articulated skeleton is one in which the bones are 
correctly arranged and this indicates that the body has not been disturbed since its 
original deposition in the grave. In contrast, a skeleton in which bones are displaced 
from their expected position may suggest that the skeleton has been dug up and 
reburied. Alternatively, the action of burrowing animals, or even certain types of 
erosion, may be responsible for displacing buried bones or removing them entirely 
from the site of burial.
 
After all necessary information has been appropriately recorded, the body can be 
recovered from its grave. The preparation of a corpse prior to removal and its treatment 
after transference to the mortuary is outlined in Chapter 2, Section 2.4. If the remains 
are fully skeletalised, the process will be different, involving the meticulous recovery 
and documenting of all bones present. It should be emphasised that throughout the 
processing of the body, it is treated as a crime scene in its own right. 
 
Removing the body from its burial site reveals an area that should not be 
overlooked. This area, previously covered by the corpse, may be a rich source of 
evidence valuable to the investigation. For example, small items, such as coins and 
buttons, may end up underneath the decomposing body. In another scenario, lime, 
deliberately used to accelerate the decomposition of the body, can percolate down 
to this layer. After all possible evidence has been recovered from the burial site and 
its investigation completed, the excavated grave can be filled in. 
 
Finally, in conjunction with the documentation of the crime scene by the crime 
scene personnel (Chapter 2, Section 2.3), the forensic archaeologist must keep 
accurate records of his or her actions, including the treatment of all samples, 
throughout the excavation. These will form the basis of the report compiled by the 
forensic archaeologist, who may be called to appear in court at some future date as 
an expert witness (Chapter 14, Section 14.3).
 
Note  This section has concentrated on the role of the forensic archaeologist in the location, 
excavation and recovery of bodies from (usually) single graves. However, forensic archaeologists 
are also involved in the location of mass graves under the auspices of organisations such as the 
UK-based charity The Inforce Foundation (International Centre for Forensic Excellence). Such 
sites of mass burial have been identified in a number of countries in recent years, including 
Iraq, Rwanda and Kosovo. As a detailed discussion of the scientific investigation of mass graves 
is beyond the scope of this book, the interested reader is referred to Cox et al. (2008) (see the 
Further reading section at the end of this chapter).
12.2 Early post-mortem changes and 
  
   the estimation of time of death
When a human body is discovered, one of the key questions to be asked is 
‘When did the person die?’ The answer to this question is particularly important 
in cases of suspicious death. The accuracy of estimating the time since death is 

 
EARly POst-mORtEm chAngEs AnD thE EstimAtiOn Of timE Of DEAth n 377
negatively correlated with the time that has elapsed since death occurred. In this 
section, the main early post-mortem changes – that is, changes in temperature, 
hypostasis, rigor mortis and changes in the eyes – are each examined in turn, with 
particular reference to their utility in estimating the time since death (known as 
the post-mortem interval). After the first few days, and up to several months 
after death, the study of insects (and, to some extent, other invertebrates) present 
on and around the decomposing corpse may yield valuable information about the 
post-mortem interval (Box 12.1).
12.2.1  Changes in body temperature
During life, the core temperature of humans (i.e. that within the abdominal organs 
and skull) is normally maintained at a constant value of around 37 °C. After death, 
the mechanisms that regulate this temperature cease and the body ultimately 
attains the temperature of its environment. In those parts of the world where 
the ambient environmental temperature is below 37 °C, this means that the body 
cools. During the cooling of the core, the drop in temperature is approximately 
exponential. If the temperature of the environment is in the range 16–20 °C, the 
temperature of the core at 6, 10 and 15 hours after death may be 30–34 °C, 28 °C 
and 24–26 °C respectively. However, it is important to realise that a number of 
factors can affect the rate of cooling of a corpse, including atmospheric conditions 
(e.g. air temperature, humidity and precipitation), the initial temperature of the 
body, the amount of clothing worn by the victim and/or the body weight to surface 
area ratio of the deceased. It should be noted that after about 42 hours, when the 
process of decomposition is well established, the temperature of the core of the 
body may be expected to rise slightly.
 
Based on observations of the type outlined in the previous paragraph, a number 
of methods have been devised that use one or more measurements of core body  
temperature to estimate the time of death by back-calculation. Although such 
methods may be subject to sizeable errors, body temperature represents the best 
measure available for estimating the time of death, especially within the first 18 
hours after death.
12.2.2  Hypostasis 
Hypostasis, also known as post-mortem lividity or livor mortis, develops shortly 
after death, becoming apparent within 1 hour, fully developed after 3 or 4 and 
usually persisting until decomposition (Section 12.3). Hypostasis is caused when 
the blood, whose normal circulation has ceased at the point of death, passively 
flows and settles in the blood vessels of the lowest parts of the body, under the 
influence of gravity. In cases of hanging, for example, this occurs in the lower legs 
and forearms. Hypostasis is normally apparent as a dark pink or dark purple-blue 
discoloration, similar in appearance to bruising. However, it does not occur in those 
areas of the body where pressure is exerted, either through contact with a firm 
surface or by clothing. The flow of blood into the capillaries is prevented and the 
areas thus affected are characteristically pale in appearance.

Entomology is the study of insects. in the forensic 
context, this discipline is primarily concerned with the 
interpretation of insect evidence found in association 
with decomposing corpses discovered under suspicious 
circumstances. Perhaps rather surprisingly, although 
there is documented evidence that entomology has 
assisted in the solution of violent crimes over several 
centuries, it has only recently become an integral part of 
the forensic investigation of major crime cases. in such 
instances, entomological samples are usually collected 
at the scene by a scenes of crime Officer (sOcO) or, if 
present, by an entomologist (who will then pass the 
material to a sOcO to document as an exhibit).
 
in the hands of a suitably qualified and experienced 
forensic entomologist (e.g. an expert from the natural 
history museum in london, or from an institute of 
higher education), evidence from insects and other 
invertebrates may yield valuable information regarding:
n the post-mortem interval;
n the circumstances surrounding the death;
n any change in the location of the body after death.
The colonisation of dead bodies
in the case of bodies left above ground, the first 
colonisers to arrive are the true flies (order Diptera) 
belonging to the families sarcophagidae (flesh-flies) 
and calliphoridae (blowflies, also known as bottleflies). 
these can arrive at the body within minutes of death to 
lay their eggs (in the case of blowflies) or deposit their 
maggots (in the case of flesh-flies) in natural orifices 
– such as the eyes, mouth or nostrils – or in wounds. 
these initial colonisers are joined a little later by 
species of houseflies (family muscidae, order Diptera). 
 
true flies are holometabolous, that is they undergo 
full metamorphosis with a life cycle comprising four 
distinct stages – egg, larva (or maggot), pupa and 
adult (see figure opposite). Within the larval stage, 
there are three recognisable substages known as the 
first, second and third instars. Entry to the second and 
third instar stages is preceded by the shedding of the 
tough larval skin to allow for subsequent growth (a 
process known as ecdysis). the larvae are necrophagous 
(i.e. they feed directly on dead tissue) and can reduce 
the corpse to skin, bone and cartilage within about 
2 weeks (depending on conditions). At this stage, 
species from other insect groups, notably beetles 
(order coleoptera), start to arrive, while the number 
of fly larvae present progressively declines. Both the 
fly larvae and the beetle species have invertebrate 
parasites and predators associated with them. 
 
the successive colonisation by insects described 
above is characteristic of bodies left to decompose 
above ground. such insects will be excluded from 
bodies found in certain other situations, such as buried 
deep underground or submerged underwater. these 
will be colonised instead by other invertebrate species 
(including insects) characteristic of that particular 
environment. in certain situations, for example if 
a body were hidden in a sealed trunk, it might be 
impossible for any species to gain access to the body.

Collection of entomological samples
it is important that entomological samples taken 
from the body at the scene, and later at autopsy, 
are collected, preserved and analysed correctly. 
in addition, live specimens should be collected to 
rear through to their adult stage, to assist in the 
identification of the species present. it should be 
noted that third instar larvae ready to pupate leave the 
body and bury themselves in the ground nearby. Pupae 
constitute valuable entomological evidence, even after 
the adult flies have emerged and the tanned pupal 
cases are empty. consequently, it may be profitable to 
search the ground near to the body for their presence.
Post-mortem interval
in the early days after death, examination of the 
development stages of the insects present can be used to 
estimate the period of time since the eggs were laid, and 
thus the post-mortem interval. this procedure was first 
used in the Ruxton case (Box 12.3). information from 
other sources, such as the state of decomposition of the 
body itself, is also valuable in this respect. As insects 
are cold-blooded animals, their rate of development 
is affected by environmental conditions, particularly 
temperature. consequently, if a body is found outside, 
knowledge of the climatic conditions (both before and 
after the approximate time of death) is necessary when 
estimating the time required for the species in question 
to reach the development stage(s) observed.
 
Other factors can influence the rate of development 
of individual insect species. for example, the larvae 
usually form a ‘maggot-mass’ and move around the body 
in this collective fashion to feed. this behaviour raises 
the temperature of their microenvironment, particularly 
in the late second and third instar stages, and needs to 
be considered when estimating development rate.
 
After the flies leave, the succession patterns of 
species arriving to colonise the body, each associated 
with a particular stage of its decomposition, can be 
used to estimate the post-mortem interval.
Circumstances surrounding the death
the concentration of insects on particular parts of a 
body in the early stages of decomposition may indicate 
the location of injuries. insects are particularly 
attracted to wounds that have been inflicted prior 
to death (i.e. ante-mortem) because these bleed 
more profusely than those made after death. this 
may therefore provide information relevant to the 
circumstances of death. in certain situations, eggs 
may be laid in wound sites before the death of the 
individual concerned. the consumption of living tissues 
by the emergent insect larvae is known as myiasis 
and has important implications for calculating the 
post-mortem interval. (myiasis is also associated with 
cases of abuse and neglect, particularly of vulnerable 
individuals, such as the elderly and the very young.)
 
in certain situations, the insects themselves may 
be used to provide relevant information about the 
individual whose body they have been using as a 
food source. for example, maggots have been used as 
specimens for toxicological analysis where no suitable 
human body tissues were available. Drugs such as 
phenobarbital and cocaine have been successfully 
detected in insect tissues, thus demonstrating the 
exposure to these substances by the persons concerned. 
it is also worth mentioning the recent research interest 
in the analysis of parasitic insect taxa for human DnA. 
if successful, this type of analysis could be of great 
potential importance in linking a suspect with a scene 
and/or a victim, especially in cases of violent crime.
Movement of the body after death
Entomological evidence may provide information about 
a change in the location of a body after death. for 
example, insect species present on a body discovered 
in a rural area may include those usually associated 
with an urban location. this indicates that the person 
was initially killed in a town or city and his or her body 
subsequently dumped in the countryside. Knowledge of 
the geographical distribution of insect species, as well 
as their life cycles, is of particular use in this respect.

The degree of post-mortem lividity present in a body can give some indication 
of the time of death, if observed shortly after death has occurred. However, this 
phenomenon is now considered a less reliable indicator of time of death than rigor 
mortis (Section 12.2.3). The main use of hypostasis is in demonstrating that the 
position or location of a body has been changed since death. If a body is moved within 
a few hours of death, the original areas of lividity tend to disappear and reform in 
new areas, consistent with the new position of the body. However, if the post-mortem 
interval is several hours, the original areas of lividity tend to persist. If these are 
inconsistent with the position of the body when discovered, this strongly indicates 
that the body has been moved from its original position several hours after death. 
 
It should be noted that injuries caused by strangulation or crushing may give the 
appearance of hypostasis. However, these can be distinguished from hypostasis by the 
presence of tiny haemorrhages under the surface of the skin (known as petechiae), 
especially on the eyelids. One final point worth making is that in certain types of  
poisoning, the colouring of post-mortem lividity is markedly different from the 
dark pink or dark purple-blue colour normally observed. For example, a cherry-pink  
coloration is indicative of carbon monoxide poisoning (Chapter 7, Section 7.1.3).
12.2.3  Rigor mortis 
Rigor mortis is the characteristic stiffening of the body that occurs in the early 
stages after death. It is caused by temporary rigidity within both the voluntary and 
involuntary muscle systems brought about by complex post-mortem biochemical 
changes in the body. Immediately after death, the body is flaccid. However, within 
about 4–6 hours, the process of rigor mortis begins. This invariably starts in the face, 
jaw and neck muscles and extends downwards to affect the arms, trunk and then 
legs. Within between 12 and 18 hours, the entire body is rigid. Rigor mortis usually 
disappears between 24 and 36 hours after death (in the same order as it appeared), 
leaving the body flaccid again. Like hypostasis, rigor mortis can provide information 
suggestive of a change in location of the body after death. This will be apparent 
if the attitude of the rigid body is inconsistent with its surroundings, for example 
where a body dumped in a ditch exhibits a position that is consistent with the  
individual having died sitting in a chair.
 
The use of rigor mortis in estimating the time since death is highly unreliable as 
this process is so variable. The times given above for the onset and disappearance of 
rigor mortis should be viewed, therefore, as rough guidelines only. The process of 
rigor mortis is highly influenced by temperature. For example, in hot climates, rigor 
mortis commences early, progresses quickly and disappears rapidly compared with 
cooler climes. In addition, the intensity of rigidity found is affected by the level of 
muscular development of the individual concerned. Elderly people and the very young 
may exhibit little or no rigor mortis owing to their lack of muscular development. 
 
It should be noted that, in rare instances, a condition known as cadaveric spasm, 
or cadaveric rigidity, occurs immediately after death, which may be mistaken for 
the very early onset of rigor mortis. The underlying mechanism for this is unknown, 
but it is apparently associated with extreme fear or tension experienced by the 
individual just before death. For example, it may be observed in some suicide cases, 
where the gun or knife used for self-destruction is found locked in the hand of the 
deceased immediately after death.

12.2.4  Changes in the eyes
Early post-mortem changes that occur in the eyes of the deceased can also be 
used to estimate the time since death. The most important of these is the level 
of potassium present in the vitreous humour of the eye (i.e. the clear gelatinous 
material that occupies the bulk of the eyeball and is located behind the lens). 
Potassium is slowly released into the vitreous humour from the blood cells of the 
retina, which break down after death. Knowledge of the rate of potassium release 
can be used to calculate the post-mortem interval.
 
Another change that may occur in the eyes in the early stages after death is the 
development of cloudiness. During life, the crystalline structure of the cornea, 
and, to some extent, the lens, is dependent on hydration (i.e. the level of water 
present). After death, the water of crystallisation is lost and, as a result, the eye 
desiccates and becomes opaque in appearance. However, the time taken for these 
changes to appear is affected by environmental conditions (e.g. of air temperature 
and humidity) and whether the eyes are closed or open. Consequently, this is not 
regarded as a reliable means of estimating the time since death.
12.3 Post-mortem decomposition 
  
  and related phenomena 
12.3.1  The process of post-mortem decomposition
In general terms, the process of decomposition may be defined as the gradual 
breakdown of dead organic matter (both animal and vegetable) and the resultant 
release of elements and compounds to the environment. In humans, post-mortem 
decomposition (also known as putrefaction) usually begins directly after death, 
although indicative signs may not appear for a few hours, or even 2 or 3 days, 
depending on circumstances. Post-mortem decomposition is brought about by a 
combination of factors, namely the action of bacteria and fungi and the chemical 
breakdown of the body tissues through autolysis (i.e. the enzymatic self-destruction 
of the body cells). Scavenging animals may also attack the corpse, thus contributing 
to the decomposition process. Among these are certain insect species whose 
presence may provide some indication of the conditions under which decomposition 
has occurred, and of the time since death (Box 12.1).
 
In humans, the process of post-mortem decomposition is generally characterised 
by a number of identifiable changes in the appearance of the body, which arise in 
roughly chronological order. In the case of bodies not immersed in water, the first 
sign to appear, usually within 2 or 3 days of death, is a greenish staining of the 
skin. This begins on the right flank of the abdomen and spreads to cover the entire 
abdominal region. This change in colour is due to the breakdown of haemoglobin 
in the red blood cells by the action of intestinal bacteria. After about 3 days, visible 
swelling of the body begins to occur. This distension is due to the gases produced by 
decomposition and is particularly noticeable in areas such as the face, genitals and 
abdomen. The next noticeable change is the greenish or reddish delineation of the 
veins near the surface of the skin, producing the characteristic effect of ‘marbling’. 
Putrefaction

used for the 
natural process 
of post-mortem 
decomposition.

 
 382 n thE REcOvERy AnD fOREnsic ExAminAtiOn Of hUmAn REmAins
Blisters, filled with gas or fluid, then start to form on the skin. When these burst, 
significant areas of the epidermis become detached from the body and are lost. The 
tongue swells, the eyeballs liquefy and decomposition fluids escape from the mouth 
and nose. Within approximately a month of death, the thoracic and abdominal 
cavities burst while the body tissues start to soften, liquefy and gradually dissolve. 
 
The succession of post-mortem changes, described above, is of limited value in 
estimating the length of time that has elapsed since death occurred. This is due 
to the high variability of the decomposition rate, which is influenced by a number 
of different factors. These are associated with environmental conditions and with 
certain attributes of the deceased. Lower temperatures, restricted air access and 
the absence of scavenging animals are among the environmental factors that will 
tend to retard decomposition. Thus, a body buried in the ground where all three of 
these conditions exist will decompose more slowly than one exposed to the air. The 
medium in which decomposition takes place therefore has a significant effect on 
the rate of decomposition. As a rough guide only, the decomposition rate of a body 
in air is approximately twice as quick as one immersed in water and between four 
and eight times as rapid as one buried in earth. Characteristics of the individual 
that may influence decomposition rate include the level of fluids and fat present 
in the body and the health of the individual concerned. Thus, people who are 
overweight and/or who are suffering from an infectious disease tend to decompose 
more rapidly.
12.3.2  Skeletalisation
The normal process of post-mortem decomposition eventually leads to the complete 
dissolution of the soft tissues of the body and the revelation of its bony framework. 
This transformation from dead body to skeleton is known as skeletalisation. As 
outlined in Section 12.3.1, the rate of decomposition is affected by a variety 
of different factors. Climate has a major influence on decomposition rate and, 
therefore, the process of skeletalisation. Consequently, in temperate climates, in 
the majority of cases, skeletalisation will take place within about 2 years, while in 
tropical zones, the process may be concluded within a matter of weeks.
 
From a medico-legal perspective, forensic interest in skeletal remains is 
restricted to those that are less than about 100 years old. This is because, after 
this length of time, the perpetrator of any suspected crime is unlikely to be still 
alive. Unfortunately, the technique of radio carbon dating, which is used to date 
artefacts of archaeological interest, cannot be effectively applied to bones that are 
less than about 100 years old. However, it may be helpful in demonstrating that the 
origin of a particular skeleton is not sufficiently recent to warrant further forensic 
investigation. One indicator that may be useful in dating a more recent skeleton 
involves the presence, or absence, of strontium-90 in the bones. This radionuclide 
(half-life 28 years) is present in the fall-out from nuclear explosions and, as it is 
chemically similar to calcium, becomes incorporated into the bones of living 
persons. Its presence in a skeleton, therefore, demonstrates that the individual 
concerned was alive post-1945, when the first atomic bomb tests were carried out.

12.3.3  Mummification and the formation of adipocere
Under certain conditions, the normal process of decomposition, outlined in Section 
12.3.1, does not occur. This may happen either because of mummification or 
because of the formation of adipocere (a greyish, waxy substance formed by the 
hydrolysis of body fat). Both of these processes result in bodies that are relatively 
well preserved. 
 
Mummification is the desiccation of the body under warm, dry conditions. This 
process results in a shrivelled, brownish corpse whose shrunken, leathery skin is 
pulled tightly over the framework of the body. The process of mummification occurs 
naturally in hot, dry climates and is seen, for example, in bodies buried in the sand. 
It may also occasionally happen in temperate regions, if conditions conducive to 
mummification are met locally. For example, new-born babies concealed after 
death may become mummified, mainly because of the very low levels of bacteria 
their bodies contain. Mummification of adults in temperate climates is rare but 
may be found in bodies that have lain concealed for long periods in places, such as 
cupboards or under floorboards, where there is circulation of dry air.
 
In contrast to mummification, adipocere formation is generally favoured 
by damp conditions. It may occur, for example, in bodies buried in wet soil or 
submerged in water. The formation of adipocere generally begins within a few weeks 
or months of death and may take a couple of years to complete. The presence of 
adipocere helps to maintain the integrity of the contours of the body, possibly for 
many decades, although it becomes progressively more brittle over time.
 
It should be noted that mummification or adipocere formation may affect the 
entire body of an individual. However, it is not uncommon for a particular body 
to show evidence of more than one post-mortem process. This occurs when the 
environmental conditions surrounding a body are not uniform. For example, a 
body half-buried face down in damp woodland may show adipocere formation on 
its front but evidence of normal decomposition elsewhere. Importantly, if there is a 
mismatch between the type of post-mortem process (or processes) observed and the 
conditions immediately surrounding the body, this may indicate that death did not 
take place in situ but that the body was dumped after death.
12.4 The establishment of cause of death
When an individual dies, it is essential that the medical ‘cause of death’ be 
established by a qualified medical practitioner. As circumstances dictate, this may 
occur either at the scene of death or, in the case of deaths reported to the coroner 
(Section 12.4.2), at a later stage, usually after the performance of a post-mortem 
examination (Section 12.4.3). The information concerning the medical cause of 
death is then entered on the death certificate in accordance with international 
standards recommended by the World Health Organization.
 
As well as the medical cause of death, the ‘manner of death’ – that is accident, 
homicide, natural causes or suicide – is also required (both legally and statistically). 
In some countries, this may be entered on the death certificate by the doctor. 
In others, including England and Wales, the manner of death is a matter for the

coroner (Section 12.4.2). It should be noted that in England and Wales, the doctor 
is required to enter on the death certificate whether he or she is of the opinion that 
a death, although due to natural causes, resulted from an industrial disease process. 
Thus, for example, exposure to asbestos during employment may have contributed 
to a death whose natural cause is mesothelioma. 
12.4.1   The circumstances under which deaths are 
reported by medical practitioners to the coroner
When the death of an individual is judged by the medical doctor attending the body 
to be due to natural causes, he or she can issue a death certificate (i.e. a certificate 
of the medical cause of death). Whether or not the doctor can then proceed to 
release the body to the next of kin for burial, or cremation, will depend on the 
exact circumstances of each case. If the medical practitioner requires guidance on 
how best to proceed in a particular case, he or she may consult informally with a 
coroner’s officer (who is usually a police officer). This type of informal consultation 
does not constitute an official ‘death reported to the coroner’.
 
There are a number of specific situations where the doctor must report the death 
of an individual to the coroner even though that death is due to natural causes and 
has, therefore, been certified. Examples include:
n deaths due to food poisoning;
n deaths where the individual has undergone an operation in the last 3 months 
of life;
n deaths where the doctor has not seen the deceased in the 2 weeks prior to 
his or her death;
n deaths due to industrial disease or toxicity;
n deaths where the individual was an alcoholic;
n deaths of persons in legal custody, even if he or she died in hospital during 
the serving of a sentence.
However, if the death of an individual is due to natural causes and no referral to the 
coroner is necessary, the body can be released to the family for burial or cremation. 
In cases where the body is destined for cremation, a second medical examination 
is required before a death certificate can be issued. This must be carried out by an  
independent, medically qualified doctor who has been fully registered for over 5 
years. This procedure is extremely important as it provides a last protection for the 
deceased individual. It was through its implementation that the criminal activities 
of Dr Harold Shipman were eventually discovered (Chapter 7, Box 7.2).
 
In all cases where the death of an individual is unnatural, sudden, unexpected or 
suspicious in any way, the medical practitioner will not issue a death certificate but 
will report the uncertified death to the coroner as soon as possible. The role of the 
coroner in the investigation of reported deaths is examined in the next section.

12.4.2  The role of the coroner in the investigation of  
 
  reported deaths
In England and Wales (and in many Commonwealth countries), the coroner’s system 
represents the authority responsible for the medico-legal investigation of reported 
deaths (in Scotland, this role is fulfilled by the Procurators Fiscal). Coroners are 
independent judicial officers. They may be either lawyers or doctors by training, but 
are often both. Each coroner has his or her own geographical area of jurisdiction 
and is required to hold investigations into the reported deaths of any individuals 
whose bodies lie within their district (even if the actual death took place outside 
their area of jurisdiction). As well as receiving reports from medical practitioners 
(Section 12.4.1), coroners are also notified of certain types of death (i.e. deaths 
whose cause is unnatural, violent or unknown) by hospital authorities, Registrars of 
Births and Deaths, and the police.
 
Once a death has been reported to the coroner, he or she must decide whether 
further investigation is required. If the coroner decides that the death was due 
to natural causes, no further inquiry is necessary. In such circumstances, a 
death certificate is issued by a doctor at the coroner’s behest and the Registrar 
of Births and Deaths notified accordingly. However, if the coroner deems that 
further investigation is necessary, he or she can request a pathologist to perform 
a post-mortem examination (Section 12.4.3). If the findings of this examination 
demonstrate that death was due to natural causes, and the case is not one in which 
the coroner is legally required to hold an inquest, the coroner’s investigation is 
concluded and appropriate steps taken to release the body for burial or cremation. 
 
If the pathologist’s examination shows that the death of a particular individual 
was not due to natural causes, the coroner will hold an inquest. The purpose of this 
public inquiry is not to apportion blame but to establish the facts that surround 
the death. These include the identification of the deceased, the medical cause of 
death and where, when and how the deceased met his or her death. In addition, 
those particulars needed to register the death are also obtained. (It should be noted 
that if, during the course of an inquest, an individual is charged with causing the 
death of the subject of the inquiry, the inquest will be adjourned. Once the trial 
is completed, the inquest is not usually resumed.) The majority of inquests are 
conducted without the presence of a jury and the verdict returned by the coroner. 
However, in certain circumstances, for example where a death has happened in 
prison, the inquest is held with a jury. In such cases, the jurors are responsible for 
returning the verdict of the inquest. 
 
The main categories of verdicts returned at inquests are:
n death by accident or misadventure;
n suicide;
n death from natural causes;
n death from industrial diseases;
n open verdict (where not enough evidence is available to categorise it otherwise);
n drug-related;
n homicide (either lawful killing, or unlawful killing).

the number of registered deaths in England and 
Wales for the year 2009 stands at 500 100 (provisional

show that deaths reported to coroners as a percentage 
of registered deaths have risen steadily since 1920. 
however, in the last few years, the percentage has 
remained fairly consistent. this is clearly illustrated in

12.4.3  Post-mortem examination
Post-mortem examination means examination of a body after death. In the UK, 
this term is usually taken to be synonymous with the word ‘autopsy’. Autopsy is the 
dissection of a corpse for investigative purposes and the procedure involves both 
external and internal examination of the deceased. It should be noted, however, 
that in some countries, examinations that are restricted to the exterior of the body 
are also referred to as post-mortem examinations.
 
There are two types of autopsy: clinical and medico-legal. Clinical autopsies may 
be performed in cases where an individual has received treatment for a particular 
 
Of the verdicts returned at inquests in England 
and Wales in 2009, the commonest category was 
death by accident or misadventure (29.1 per cent), 
closely followed by death from natural causes (27.8 
per cent), suicide (11.2 per cent), industrial diseases 
(8.8 per cent) and open verdicts (7.5 per cent), see 
figure (b). Annual statistics dating back to 1988 show 
that death by accident or misadventure consistently 
formed the largest category of verdicts returned at 
inquests. however, the overall trend since 1988 shows 
a decrease in the size of this category, with the lowest 
percentage yet (29.1 per cent) recorded in 2009. for 
the years 1988 to 1999, annual statistics show that 
suicide formed the next largest category, ranging from 
16.2 to 20.1 per cent. however, in the year 2000, 
suicide accounted for 15.7 per cent of the verdicts 
returned at inquests, which was 0.1 per cent less than 
the category ‘death from natural causes’. in each of 
the nine subsequent years (2001–09 inclusive), ‘death 
from natural causes’ has remained the second largest 
category, with suicide in third position in each of the 
years 2001–07 inclusive (in both 2008 and 2009, the 
number of verdicts in the ‘all other verdicts’ category 
slightly exceeded those in the ‘suicide’ category).
 
for the year 2009, a verdict of homicide was 
returned in 227 cases, or 0.76 per cent of the verdicts 
returned (figure (b)). this accounts only for those 
cases that have gone to inquest and for which nobody 
has yet been prosecuted. therefore it is not a true 
picture of the number of homicides in England and 
Wales. for example, in the year 2008–09, there were 
651 deaths (provisional figure) that were initially 
recorded as homicides in England and Wales (source

disease before his or her death and, consequently, the cause of death is believed 
to be known. The purpose of this type of autopsy is to verify the diagnosis and, by 
doing so, give reassurance to the relatives of the deceased. However, very strict rules 
are now in force and a clinical autopsy cannot be performed without the consent of 
the next of kin. Any information gained through clinical autopsies may be used for 
research and educational purposes. 
 
Medico-legal autopsies (sometimes referred to as forensic autopsies) are 
carried out when the cause of death is unknown or suspicious, at the request of 
the appropriate legal authority. In England and Wales, this is represented by the 
coroners’ system (Section 12.4.2). Medico-legal autopsies are only performed by 
pathologists who appear on the Home Office list. In order to be included on this 
approved list, individuals must undergo extensive forensic training (including 
considerable on-the-job training) and gain the necessary qualifications.
 
The procedure used for medico-legal autopsy tends to follow a general pattern, 
although it necessarily differs in detail according to the particular circumstances of 
death. Naturally, the condition of the corpse will influence the effectiveness of the 
autopsy. Since decomposition of the body begins immediately after death (Section 
12.3), the shorter the time interval between death and autopsy, the better from the 
pathologist’s point of view. However, useful information has been obtained from the 
autopsy of bodies exhumed from graveyards several months after burial.
 
In certain cases, such as suspected murder, the pathologist usually attends the 
suspected crime scene to view the body in situ, prior to its removal to a mortuary 
for autopsy. He or she may take photographs of the deceased at the scene to 
include in the autopsy report. In some instances, the pathologist may be able to 
give an opinion as to the apparent manner of death (i.e. natural, accident, suicide 
or homicide) based on his or her observations at the scene. (In suspicious cases, 
the body is treated as a crime scene in its own right and details concerning its 
preparation for removal to the mortuary, and the recovery of physical evidence 
associated with it, are given in Chapter 2, Section 2.4.)
 
Ideally, the body of an individual should be identified before autopsy takes 
place; a task usually performed by a relative or a close friend of the deceased. 
However, identification is not possible in every case. For example, the body may be 
unrecognisable, perhaps as a result of decomposition or mutilation. In such cases, 
autopsy will proceed in the absence of identification, which must be established by 
other means (Section 12.5). 
 
If the body is clothed, the pathologist will make a preliminary examination of 
the clothing, especially for any damage marks present (such as knife cuts or bullet-
holes) and bloodstains, and note how these are related to any injuries present on 
the body. After examining the clothed body, the clothing is removed and each item 
stored separately. It should be noted that traces of physical evidence, for example 
scrapings from underneath the fingernails, are routinely recovered from the body 
in the mortuary, both before and after the clothing is removed, for subsequent 
forensic analysis. This task is performed by appropriate personnel, such as SOCOs or 
forensic scientists. The various stages of the autopsy procedure are recorded using 
both photographs (including close-ups, e.g. of injuries) and observational notes.

External examination
In medico-legal autopsies, especially where death has been traumatic, the external 
examination of the body usually yields more evidence than the internal dissection 
that follows it. External examination should therefore be most thorough and all 
relevant features noted. These typically include:
n characteristics of race, sex and age;
n body length;
n body weight (including state of nutrition);
n any abnormal skin coloration (including presence of hypostasis – Section 
12.2.2);
n the presence of any marks, for example tattoos, old burns, injury scars (these 
may be important for identification purposes – Section 12.5);
n the degree of rigor mortis;
n the presence of any discharged body fluids (e.g. blood and urine);
n the condition of the anus and external genitals;
n the presence of any injuries of recent origin, for example incised wounds, 
burns, bruises or gunshot wounds (recorded by marking on pre-printed body 
diagrams (Figure 12.2), detailed description and photographs).

In some cases, for example where explosives or gunshots have been involved, the 
body may be examined using radiological techniques before proceeding to the next 
stage – the internal examination.
Internal examination
After a thorough evaluation has been made of all relevant external features, the 
body is opened up for internal examination. This is usually performed by making an 
incision down the front of the body from just below the larynx to the pubic region, 
avoiding the navel. In cases of hanging or strangulation, a Y-shaped incision is 
favoured. This extends from behind each ear, converges above the breastbone and 
proceeds in a downward direction. 
 
The internal examination of a body should include all major body organs. Samples 
of body fluids (e.g. urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid), stomach and intestinal 
contents, and organs (particularly the liver) are collected for analysis, mainly of 
a toxicological nature (Chapter 7, Section 7.5). In addition, tissue samples (e.g. 
brain, lung and heart) should also be taken, wherever possible, in order to study 
their structure in detail, especially with reference to signs of natural disease. 
After the internal examination is concluded, the cadaver is sewn up. For a detailed 
description of the internal examination of the body during autopsy (a task far 
beyond the remit of this book), the interested reader is referred to Bernard Knight’s 
excellent text on forensic pathology (see Further reading).
 
The findings of the autopsy, including (where possible) their relationship to the 
cause of death, should be written up in the form of a comprehensive and detailed 
report as soon as possible after completion of the examination. This final report, 
accompanied by relevant photographs and documents, is then submitted to the 
coroner (Section 12.4.2). 
12.5 The identification of human 
  
   remains
In most cases, human remains are identified by a close relative or friend who is asked 
to view the body for this purpose. Where identity cannot be established by these 
means, at least in the first instance, other methods must be employed. This section 
outlines those characteristics of human remains upon which these methods are based.
 
The identification of the deceased person is an integral part of the post-mortem 
examination (Section 12.4.3). Correct identification is essential for several reasons, 
including humanitarian considerations and legal requirements, and is of particular 
importance where the death of an individual is criminal or suspicious in nature and 
therefore the subject of police investigation. The identification of human remains is 
also especially important in situations of mass disaster, such as caused by a severe 
explosion or earthquake. Under these circumstances, the bodies of the victims 
are often unrecognisable as a result of the catastrophic event and, in many cases, 
badly fragmented. It is therefore necessary to both assign the separate body parts 
to specific individuals and to identify the people concerned; this may be achieved 
through DNA profiling (Chapter 6).

 
thE iDEntificAtiOn Of hUmAn REmAins n 391
 
The characteristics that are used to establish the identity of a dead person 
depend on the physical state of the body. In the absence of severe disfigurement, 
through, for example, exposure to intense heat, the state of the body will depend 
mainly on the degree to which it has decomposed. Post-mortem decomposition is 
a natural process whereby the dead body gradually disintegrates over time until 
only the skeletal components remain (Section 12.3). Identification of the individual 
by visual cues becomes progressively more difficult as the decomposition process 
advances. Furthermore, identification may be hindered if the corpse has been 
subjected to dismemberment or mutilation. 
 
It should be noted that, on occasion, it may be necessary to identify living 
persons who are not able to provide their own personal details. This may occur if, 
for example, they are suffering from memory loss or are too young to articulate 
the information. Although this aspect is not dealt with specifically in this chapter, 
much of the information gathered from fresh corpses is equally applicable to the 
identification of living individuals. 
12.5.1  The identification of non-skeletalised bodies
A number of characteristics may be used, in combination, to identify the body of an 
individual before it becomes skeletalised (i.e. reduced to a skeleton). Usually, as the 
body decomposes, the availability and clarity of these features become progressively 
less. Therefore, the fresher the corpse, the greater the chance of obtaining accurate 
information that will lead, potentially, to the identification of the deceased. As well as 
advanced putrefaction, extensive mutilation of the body also increases the difficulty 
of making a positive identification. This is illustrated by the case of Dr Buck Ruxton 
who murdered his wife and maid in 1935 and sought to prevent their identification by 
dismemberment and extensive mutilation of their bodies (Box 12.3).
 
Many of the features used in the identification of non-skeletalised bodies are 
morphological. They include the following:
n Height (stature). This is recorded by measuring the length of the body from the 
heel to the crown of the head. It should be noted that this may differ slightly 
from the height of the live individual because of post-mortem changes. 
n Weight. Care should be taken in using the weight of the corpse to estimate that 
of the live individual. For example, bloating associated with decomposition 
may lead to an overestimation of the weight of the individual before death.
n Eye colour. This may be a useful morphological feature in the identification 
of Caucasians (where the colour of the iris varies) but only in the first day 
or two after death. After this time, all irises appear brownish as a result of 
decomposition.
n Hair colour, structure and distribution. Hair has the advantage that it is 
practically indestructible and will usually persist long after the soft tissues 
of the body have dissolved. The colour of hair may be useful in identification, 
although it can be affected by decomposition, for example, fair hair tends to 
become darker. The natural colour of head hair may have been altered during 
life by dyeing or bleaching and this should be taken into account when 
making a possible identification. In addition, the structure of head hair may 
indicate racial origin of the decedent while the distribution of facial hair, for 
example the presence of a beard, may assist in personal identification.

On the morning of 29 september 1935, several bundles, 
including one from which a human arm protruded, were 
sighted by a young woman on holiday. these were 
scattered along the banks of the gardenholme linn, a 
tributary of the River Annan, near moffat in scotland. 
subsequent police investigations led to the eventual 
recovery of 70 body fragments, including some 
recovered downstream and others found in different 
localities. these fragments were sent to the Anatomy 
Department of Edinburgh University for examination. 
it was obvious to the pathologists involved, Professor 
John glaister and Professor James couper Brash, 
that the person responsible for the dismemberment, 
of what they believed to be two bodies, had 
considerable medical and anatomical knowledge. 
moreover, the perpetrator had deliberately sought to 
prevent identification of the two victims by extensive 
mutilation, including, in each case, the removal of 
their eyes, nose, ears, lips and facial skin and, in one 
case, the removal of the fingertips. 
 
through painstaking reconstruction of the body 
pieces, the pathologists concluded that one of the 
corpses belonged to a female, probably between 
20 and 21 years of age, and between 4 feet 10 
inches and 4 feet 111/2 inches (1.47 and 1.51 m) in 
height. the other body proved more problematic 
because of the more extensive mutilation of 
the face. initially, it was identified as a man of 
about 60 years of age and around 5 feet 6 inches  
(1.68 m) in height but was later revised to that of a 
strongly built woman, probably between 35 and 45 
years of age and about 5 feet 31/2 inches (1.61 m) tall.
 
meanwhile, insect larvae (maggots) infesting the 
decomposing remains were identified, by Dr Alexander 
mearns, as those of the bluebottle Calliphora vicina. 
from the developmental stage of the maggots present, 
he estimated that the minimum time between death 
and the discovery of the remains was 12–14 days. 
further information relevant to estimating the time of 
death was provided by one of the newspapers used to 
wrap some of the body fragments. this was dated 15 
september 1935, thus corroborating the entomological 
evidence. the newspaper in question, the Sunday 
Graphic, also played a key role in establishing a 
connection between the parcelled human remains 
found in scotland and the morecambe/lancaster 
area in England. Examination of its printed contents 
revealed that it was a local edition distributed only in 
morecambe, lancaster and the surrounding area. 
 
the disappearance of mrs isabella Ruxton (aged 34 
years and 7 months) and of her children’s nursemaid 
mary Jane Rogerson (aged 20 years) from the family 
home in lancaster was linked with the discovery of 
the human remains in scotland. Both were last seen 
on 14 september 1935. the physical characteristics of 
the two missing individuals were found to be similar 
to those attributed to the corpses reassembled, as far 
as possible, from the parcels of human remains. in 
mrs Ruxton’s case, the use of photo-superimposition 
(Box 12.5) demonstrated a close match between her 
bare skull and a photographic portrait taken when 
she was alive. in each case, mutilation of specific 
parts of the corpses coincided with those parts of the 
missing individuals that were either known to bear  
identifying features (such as operation scars or  
birthmarks) or were particularly characteristic of that 
individual. however, the fingertips had not been 
removed from the younger woman and fingerprints 
taken from her corpse were found to match those 
present on objects in the Ruxton’s lancaster home. 
 
As a consequence of mounting evidence against 
him, Dr Buck Ruxton was arrested and tried for the 
murder of his common-law wife, isabella, and that 
of mary Jane Rogerson, the nursemaid. he was found 
guilty and hanged on 12 may 1936.

pathologists involved are referred to glaister, J. and Brash, J. c.

n Skin pigmentation. Pigmentation of the skin may be of some use in ascribing 
racial origin. However, caution should be exercised as the process of 
decomposition can significantly alter skin colour. 
n Facial appearance. The possession of certain characteristic facial features 
may be useful in determining racial origin. If the body is not noticeably 
decomposed, photographs of the face – both full face and profile  – may be 
circulated to obtain a possible identification of the deceased. 
n Fingerprints. The use of fingerprints in the identification of individuals 
is discussed in detail in Chapter 4, Section 4.1. In the early post-mortem 
stages, fingerprints may be obtained from a corpse in much the same manner 
as from a live individual, that is by inking or powdering them. However, they 
may also be successfully taken where the body has deteriorated through, for 
example, decomposition or prolonged immersion in water, provided that 
appropriate preparatory steps are taken. The fingerprinting of deceased 
individuals is usually performed at the end of the post-mortem examination, 
in order to avoid contamination of any other evidence present on the body. 
This process usually involves inking or powdering the fingers directly but, in 
some cases, may require the removal of the skin.
As described above, some morphological features, such as skin pigmentation and hair 
characteristics, may help to identify the racial origin of the deceased. Establishing the 
sex of the individual (an essential factor in personal identification) is straightforward 
in the early stages of decomposition. Indeed, the persistence of the uterus in females, 
and, to a lesser extent, the prostate gland in males, means that this is still feasible 
even when decomposition has reached an advanced state. However, if it is not possible 
to determine the sex of the deceased through direct observation, DNA profiling can 
normally be used (Chapter 6, Section 6.3). Much harder to establish is the age of the 
deceased, although the presence of certain features is indicative of advancing years. 
These include the red Campbell de Morgan spots found on the skin and a white or 
grey ring surrounding the iris of the eye, known as the arcus senilis. However, the 
arcus senilis is also an indicator of raised cholesterol in the bloodstream and care 
should therefore be taken in interpreting its presence as a sign of old age. Below the 
age of about 25, the pattern of eruption of the teeth (both ‘milk’ and permanent sets) 
can be used to estimate the age of the decedent. 
 
External examination of the corpse may reveal the presence of certain features 
specific to that individual that are potentially useful in establishing a positive  
identification. These include the following:
n Tattoos. Tattoos are essentially permanent marks on the skin. They are made 
by pricking the skin and inserting one or more pigments to form the desired 
design. The nature and location of the tattoo and, in particular, the inclusion of 
specific names (often the first name of a boy- or girlfriend) may be useful to the 
police in identifying the deceased. In some cases, the actual design of the tattoo 
itself may convey useful information about the activities of the deceased during 
life. Tattoos are especially useful as identifying features as they are relatively 
persistent and may be clearly seen, even after the outer layer of the epidermis 
(the stratum corneum) has been lost during the decomposition process.

 
 394 n thE REcOvERy AnD fOREnsic ExAminAtiOn Of hUmAn REmAins
n Scars. Scars are healed wounds and, as such, represent sites of past injury. 
They are commonly caused by surgery or by accident, or, less frequently, by 
deliberate assault. The presence of a scar, or scars, on the skin may be useful 
in identifying an individual, provided that they can be verified by relatives or 
friends, or checked against relevant medical records.
n Skin blemishes, for example moles and birthmarks.
n Pierced body parts, for example nose, ear lobes and eyebrows.
n Circumcision.
n Amputated limbs or digits.
In addition to the external features outlined above, the dissection of the body 
during post-mortem examination may reveal the presence of certain medical  
conditions, such as stomach ulcers or gallstones, or evidence of previous surgery 
or injury. Damage to bony structures may also be revealed prior to dissection 
through the use of radiography. Such internal findings may be useful in assisting  
identification, through comparison with ante-mortem records of possible matches. 
 
Importantly, the techniques of DNA profiling (Chapter 6), which are used to 
identify living individuals, may also be successfully applied to post-mortem tissues.
12.5.2  The identification of skeletalised remains 
Through the natural process of decomposition, the soft tissues and organs of the 
body gradually disappear to reveal the bony skeleton underneath (Section 12.3). 
Identification of the individual when only the skeletal components remain is more 
difficult than when a fresh (or even decomposing) body is available, and even more 
so if the skeleton is incomplete or fragmented.
 
In cases where the skeletal remains consist of a collection of bones and/
or bone fragments, it is necessary to establish whether they are human in origin 
before investigating further. If the bones are wholly, or largely, intact, a working 
knowledge of anatomy is usually sufficient to distinguish human bones from those of 
other animals, although some of the smaller bones may be more difficult to assign. 
(Anatomical knowledge is also useful when other materials, such as plastic, stone 
or wood, are (mistakenly) thought to be bones.) However, if only fragments of bone 
are available, other techniques are required to identify their origin. Species-specific 
serological tests (Chapter 5, Section 5.1.3) may be applied if the bones in question 
are recent enough to still contain the protein necessary for the tests (i.e. less 
than a decade old) and provided that they have not been severely burnt. Although 
these tests are usually the preferred option for identifying species of origin, DNA 
techniques based on mitochondrial DNA can also be used for this purpose (Chapter 
6, Section 6.5).
 
Once it has been verified that the bones in question are human, the difficult task 
of identifying the individual can begin. As is the case with non-skeletalised bodies, 
general characteristics are usually established first, followed by those individualising 
features that may lead to personal identification through comparison with 
ante-mortem information (if available). 

 
thE iDEntificAtiOn Of hUmAn REmAins n 395
Class characteristics
The degree to which it is possible to establish class characteristics – of height, sex, 
age and race – is dependent on a number of factors, including the types of bones 
available (if the skeleton is incomplete) and their condition. Each of these class 
characteristics is now briefly examined in turn:
n Height (stature). In cases where the skeleton is complete, the height of the 
live individual may be estimated by direct measurement. However, when 
taking this measurement, the lack of tissue, for example between the 
vertebrae of the backbone, must be taken into account. In the absence of a 
whole skeleton, measurement of the length of the long bones (also referred 
to colloquially as the major limb bones) may be used to calculate the stature 
of the individual, by reference to appropriate stature tables. The long bones 
of the leg, namely the femur (thighbone), fibula and tibia (shinbones), are 
usually preferred for this purpose over the long bones of the arm (i.e. the 
humerus, radius and ulna).
n Sex. The sex of a skeleton can be determined, with a high degree of accuracy, 
by an individual who is suitably experienced in anatomy. Morphological 
differences between the sexes are particularly noticeable in the pelvis, 
skull and, to a lesser extent, the long bones (and, of these, the femur in 
particular). However, it should be noted that both race and age may have an 
effect on the appearance, including size, of these features. 
n Age. Estimating the age of an individual at the time of death, through an 
examination of his or her skeletal remains, generally becomes more difficult 
the greater the age of the person concerned (especially after the middle of 
the third decade). Up to the age of about 5 years, the appearance of the 
major ossification centres (where bone is formed to replace cartilage) can be 
used to estimate age, since each of these appear at a particular time during 
the early years of life. Between the ages of 5 and 25 years, another process of 
bone growth, the fusion of the epiphyses (singular: epiphysis), can similarly 
be used to estimate the age of an individual at the time of his or her death. 
To understand what is meant by the term ‘epiphysis’ and the process of its 
fusion, it is useful to use the femur as an illustrative example (as its major 
structural components are typical of those found in all long bones). As can 
be seen from Figure 12.3, the diaphysis (i.e. the central shaft of the long 
bone) terminates in a growing region called the metaphysis at each end. At 
the proximal end of the femur (i.e. the end nearest to the trunk of the body), 
the metaphysis is capped by two epiphyses, while at its distal end it is capped 
by one epiphysis. In each case, the epiphysis is formed from a separate centre 
of ossification and eventually fuses with the end of the long bone with which 
it is associated. The process of fusion, known as epiphyseal union, takes 
several years to complete and occurs at a number of specific locations within 
the body (Figure 12.4). For each such location, epiphyseal union occurs 
over a known age range. Available data take into account variations in the 
exact timing of this range due to factors such as gender and the climate 
experienced during development. For example, epiphyseal union for the head

of the femur (thighbone) for a male in a non-tropical climate is partial at 
the age of 16 years and complete by the age of 19 (Figure 12.4). It should 
be noted that tooth eruption can also be utilised in estimating the age of 
individuals who die before the age of about 25 years.
n Race. It is much more difficult to identify the possible racial origin – 
white (Caucasian), Negroid or Mongoloid – of skeletal remains than either 
to determine sex or to estimate age. However, there are some features, 
especially of the skull, that can be used to indicate racial origin. For example, 
‘shovel-shaped’ upper incisors (i.e. those with raised edges on their lingual 
surface) have a high frequency of occurrence in a number of Mongoloid 
races, such as the Chinese and Japanese, but a low frequency of occurrence 
(i.e. <15 per cent) in Caucasians and Negroids. The lingual surface of the 
upper incisors of the latter two groups is usually flat.

Individualising features
Once the class characteristics of the individual have been established (as far as is 
possible), attention is then focused on those features of the skeletal remains that 
may be of use in making a personal identification. This is only possible if reliable 
ante-mortem information for potential matches is available for comparison. 
Features that may be used for identifying purposes include the following: 
n Dentition. As a consequence of their practical indestructibility, teeth can 
provide the best means of personal identification, not only for skeletal 
remains but also in cases where the body is otherwise unrecognisable, 
for example severely disfigured through exposure to intense heat. The 
arrangement and characteristics of the teeth and the treatment to which they 
have been subjected during life (e.g. repairs, restoration, extractions) mean 
that human dentition is, potentially, uniquely identifiable. The post-mortem 
examination of teeth and their comparison with ante-mortem dental records 
requires the expert knowledge of the forensic odontologist. An example of 
how ante-mortem dental records were successfully used to identify a victim of 
murder is given in Box 12.4. 
in July 1942, workmen demolishing the wreckage of 
a Baptist chapel in Kennington, southeast london, 
discovered a corpse beneath a stone slab in the cellar. 
Although the body was almost fully skeletalised, it 
had clearly been dismembered and was not, as initially 
thought, a victim of the german bombing raids. moreover, 
slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) had been spread over 
the body, ostensibly to accelerate its decomposition 
(although, in fact, it has the reverse effect) and there 
was evidence that the body had also been burnt. 
 
the home Office pathologist Dr Keith simpson was 
called in to examine the remains. he established that 
the victim was female and noted that her hair, which was 
dark brown, was starting to turn grey. he estimated her 
age as somewhere between 40 and 50 years, her height 
as around 5 feet (1.52 m) and that she had been dead 
for between 12 and 18 months. the presence of a blood 
clot associated with the remains of the victim’s larynx 
(voice box) strongly pointed to manual strangulation 
as the cause of death. Post-mortem examination of the 
remains also showed that the uterus of the victim was 
enlarged due to the presence of a fibroid tumour.
 
After consulting the record of missing persons, the 
police came up with a potential match: that of mrs 
Rachel Dobkin, aged 47 years, who had been reported 
missing about 15 months earlier (on 11 April 1941). As 
well as concurrence between her age, height and the 
date of her disappearance, ante-mortem medical records 
revealed that she had indeed suffered from a fibroid 
tumour. however, odontological evidence was to prove 
crucial in positively identifying the corpse as that of mrs 
Dobkin. Although the lower jaw of the skeletalised victim 
was not recovered, a comparison between the teeth of 
the upper jaw, which had undergone extensive dental 
treatment, and the meticulous ante-mortem dental 
records held for mrs Dobkin demonstrated an exact 
match. in particular, it was known that the extraction of 
two specific teeth had left parts of the roots embedded 
in mrs Dobkin’s jaw. x-ray examination of the corpse’s 
jaw revealed the presence of these two residual roots.
 
mr harry Dobkin, the estranged husband of the 
deceased, who worked as a fire-watcher in the vicinity 
of the Baptist chapel in Kennington, was arrested and 
charged with her murder. he was found guilty and 
hanged.

n Anatomical structure. Certain parts of the skeleton can be used for 
identification purposes if suitable ante-mortem radiological (X-ray) information 
from possible victims is available. The skull is especially useful in this respect. 
In particular, the pattern of the frontal sinus is unique to each individual 
and can be used to exclude or confirm a potential match. The techniques of 
photosuperimposition and facial reconstruction, which make specific use of 
the skull to identify individuals, are discussed in Box 12.5.
n Bone injury. Evidence of past injury to the bone, such as a fracture, may 
prove useful in identification. However, this may not be evident if sufficient 
time has elapsed to allow the injury to heal completely. 
n Bone disease. There are a number of disorders affecting bone structure that 
may be apparent in skeletal remains. The four common ones are Paget’s 
disease (osteitis deformans), osteitis fibrosa, osteomalacia (adult form 
of rickets) and osteoporosis. Each of these diseases has a characteristic 
histological appearance under the microscope that any suitably qualified 
forensic pathologist could easily identify.
n Surgical implants. The presence of a surgical implant, such as an artificial hip 
joint, bearing a unique serial number may allow definitive identification of 
the individual concerned (Figure 12.5).
n Material suitable for DNA analysis. It may be possible to make a personal 
identification of skeletal remains through the technique of DNA analysis 
(Chapter 6, Section 6.3). Good sources of DNA include dental pulp and bone 
marrow but even bone itself can be used if necessary. 
Photosuperimposition
A forensic technique 
in which a  
photographic image 
of the bare skull 
of the deceased is 
superimposed onto 
a photographic 
portrait, taken 
during life, of a 
possible match.
Facial reconstruction
A forensic 
technique aimed at 
reconstructing the 
facial appearance of 
an individual based 
on the features of 
his or her skull.
Photosuperimposition
in some cases, photosuperimposition has been used 
successfully to match a skull with a photograph of the 
suspected victim. One of the most notable examples 
is that of isabella Ruxton, who was murdered by 
her husband, Dr Buck Ruxton, in 1935 (Box 12.3). 
traditionally, the technique of photosuperimposition 
involved photographing the skull and then 
superimposing the resultant image, printed on 
transparent film, over a photographic portrait of the 
individual in question. During this procedure, both the 
orientation and size of the photograph of the skull 
were matched as closely as possible to that of the 
portrait. in recent years, video techniques have been 
used to superimpose images of the skull onto a picture 
of the individual concerned. correspondence of major 
anatomical features, such as the teeth, supraorbital 
ridges and nasal aperture, indicates that the skull 
could belong to the individual in the portrait, while no 
agreement excludes the individual as a possible match.
Facial reconstruction
facial reconstruction is a highly skilled procedure 
that involves building up the facial appearance of an

individual from his or her bare skull (see figure below). 
this technique was pioneered towards the end of the 
nineteenth century by Wilhelm his (a swiss anatomist) 
and later developed by others, notably the Russians 
A. D. grigoriev and mikhail gerasimov. historically, 
facial reconstruction has largely been of interest to 
historians and archaeologists. however, in recent 
years, this technique has become recognised as an 
important forensic tool in the identification of skeletal 
remains. 
 
facial reconstruction uses, as its basis, compiled 
data concerning the average thickness of soft tissue 
over many different points on the skull. Using a cast of 
the skull, layers of suitable material, usually modelling 
clay, are built up to cover the skull to the requisite 
depth. this is achieved by first inserting, for example, 
rods or cocktail sticks into the cast to predetermined 
depths and then just covering them with the clay. the 
clay is then smoothed over to resemble human skin. 
Prosthetic eyeballs are inserted into the eye sockets to 
give the reconstruction a more life-like appearance.
 
Reconstruction of other aspects of the individual’s 
appearance, such as the nose, ears, lips and hair 
(colour, length, style, etc.), relies on the skill and 
experience of the sculptor, since the underlying bone 
structure provides little or no relevant information.
 
however, despite these difficulties, facial 
reconstruction has led, on occasion, to the 
identification of skeletal remains. for example, 
reconstruction of the facial appearance of an unknown 
female by Richard neave (of the Department of Art in 
medicine, manchester University) led to the recognition 
and identification of Karen Price, whose body was found 
buried in a cardiff garden in 1989. in recent years, 
techniques based on computer graphics have been 
developed for the purpose of facial reconstruction.

n in cases of serious crime, the services of a forensic 
archaeologist may be requested by the police. he or 
she is able to offer advice and practical assistance in 
the location, excavation and recovery of buried human 
remains and, in the process, help maximise the recovery of 
forensic evidence.
n When the death of an individual is sudden, violent, 
unnatural, of unknown cause or suspicious in any way, 
forensic examination of the human remains can yield 
much valuable information concerning the death and the 
circumstances that surround it. in England and Wales, 
deaths that cannot be attributed to natural causes are 
reported to the coroner for further investigation. sources 
of reported deaths include medical doctors, hospital 
authorities, the police and Registrars of Births and Deaths. 
n in each case of reported death, the coroner must 
decide whether it is necessary to order a post-mortem  
examination of the body (figures for the year 2009 show 
that this occurred in approximately 46 per cent of cases). 
Post-mortem examination for medico-legal purposes is 
usually carried out by a forensic pathologist. however, in 
cases where the human remains are in skeletal form, or are 
otherwise unrecognisable, forensic anthropologists and/or 
forensic odontologists may provide the necessary expertise. 
n the purpose of the post-mortem examination is to establish 
certain facts concerning the deceased and the circumstances 
surrounding his or her death. notable among these are the 
time of death, the cause of death and the identification of 
the individual. in cases of suspicious deaths, such facts are 
critical to the police investigation.

Introduction
Arguably, the work undertaken by a forensic scientist on any one particular piece 
of evidence that is used in court is a seamless process from the arrival of the item 
concerned in the scientist’s possession to the presentation of the scientist’s findings 
Statistics and the 
analysis, interpretation 
and evaluation of evidence

IntRoDUCtIon n 405
to the court. However, in order to understand this process better, there is value in 
thinking of it as having three stages. These shall be referred to here as analysis, 
interpretation and evaluation. Do keep in mind, however, that the division between 
these three phases is somewhat artificial, that the boundaries between them are 
blurred, and that the emphasis placed on each will vary from case to case and from 
one type of evidence to the next.
 
The analysis stage is concerned with the characterisation of the item of evidence 
by noting its properties. For example, examination of a shard of glass recovered from 
a crime scene will reveal its apparent colour and, by means of the measurements 
described in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2, its refractive index. 
 
Interpretation is concerned with what can be established about the nature of 
the item of evidence from the data obtained by analysis. For example, consider an 
instance in which the analysis of a shard of glass shows it to be green and to have 
a refractive index in the range expected for both glass commonly used to make 
bottles and that used to manufacture windowpanes. From this information, it would 
be reasonable to conclude that this shard could have originated from either of 
these sources. Furthermore, as green glass is rarely used to make windowpanes but 
bottles made of green glass are common, it might be reasonable to interpret the 
results of the analysis to mean that it is more likely that the shard came from a 
bottle than from a windowpane.
 
However, great care must be taken not to jump to conclusions during the 
interpretation process. To return to our example, it must be borne in mind that the 
shard may be from neither a bottle nor a windowpane, as green glass is made into 
other objects as well.
 
Evaluation is the placing of the work within the context of the case in question. 
If, in the course of a burglary, a windowpane is broken with a hammer held in the 
right hand of the perpetrator who was wearing a long-sleeved jacket, the person’s 
right sleeve will be showered in minute pieces of glass from the window. If a suspect 
were arrested 30 minutes after the incident, it would be prudent to examine his 
or her clothing for small fragments of glass. Consider what would occur if it were 
found that the suspect had multiple tiny fragments of glass on his or her jacket’s 
right sleeve but the suspect claimed that these must have originated from a beer 
bottle that he or she had broken while working in a bar that evening. Under these 
circumstances, the forensic scientist is likely to be asked to examine glass taken 
from the broken window, that from the sleeve and, if it is available, that from the 
bottle. The scientist might well be asked for an evaluation of the likelihood of the 
glass on the sleeve originating from the bottle, the broken pane or both of these 
sources. To do this, the scientist must compare the characteristics of glass samples 
taken from all three locations with each other and with what is known about glass 
in general. This is an example of evidence evaluation.
 
Arguably, in any one case, the forensic scientist should think deeply about how the 
evidence is to be evaluated before the analysis stage is started. This concept is at the 
heart of what is known as the Case Assessment and Interpretation model. This is a 
system devised to enable forensic science services to be fit for purpose while offering 
value for money. This model is described later in this chapter (Section 13.6.2).
 
It is important to realise that although a forensic scientist might be asked to 
evaluate the evidence that he or she has scrutinised, it is not the job of the scientist 
to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused. This is the task of the court.

This distinction between the roles of the scientist and the court is of fundamental 
importance and is returned to in Chapter 14.
 
Statistical methods exist that can help the forensic scientist in each of the 
analysis, interpretation and evaluation phases of work. This chapter is intended 
to introduce key aspects of these methods. However, the reader is encouraged to 
extend his or her learning beyond its contents by reading the books listed at the 
end of this chapter.
13.1 Data
The discipline of statistics is concerned with the collection of data and the 
measurement of uncertainty. In order to appreciate how this can be of value within 
the context of forensic science, it is necessary to understand something of the 
nature of data and uncertainty.
13.1.1 Types of data
Data are facts and figures that convey information. The feature of data that 
distinguishes them from other forms of information is normally taken to be that 
data are gathered in order to conduct analysis, interpretation or evaluation, or to 
help make decisions.
 
As illustrated in Figure 13.1, different types of data are recognised. As the name 
suggests, qualitative data convey information about the qualities of the things 
being studied and do not directly convey information about quantity or size. A piece 
of qualitative data conveys which of a number of separate categories (also known 
as classes or groups) of the same feature a given thing belongs to. For example, 
a drug (the thing) may be described as being one of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, 
etc. (the categories) – the feature here is the type of drug. The drugs in each of 
these categories have attributes in common and have attributes that are different

from all other categories of drug. Qualitative data are useful as they sort things into 
categories (a process called classification); because they do this, qualitative data 
can also be called categorical data. 
 
In the forensic context, attributes that allow an item or person to be assigned 
to a category that contains two or more items or people are known as class 
characteristics. For example, examination of a bullet that has been fired from a 
rifled firearm may reveal characteristics (calibre, direction of rifling, etc.) that may 
allow the possible makes and models of the firearm to be established. Even if it were 
possible to narrow the firearm to a particular make and model, these details would 
still be class characteristics, as a manufacturer will make many firearms of the same 
make and model. In contrast, attributes that allow an item or person to be assigned 
to a category that contains only one item or person are known as individualising 
characteristics. As described in Chapter 9, Section 9.4.2, the striation markings 
in the land impressions made on a fired bullet by a rifled barrel can, under many 
circumstances, be used to individualise the barrel concerned as it is believed that 
each barrel will produce a unique pattern of these striations. Note that, in theory at 
least, it is possible for a combination of class characteristics to be individualising. 
Although each such characteristic places the item or individual into a group with 
others, the exact combination of these characteristics may be unique to that item 
or person. For example, the SGM+ DNA profiling system examines 10 loci. It is 
quite possible for a person to have a relatively common genotype for each of these 
loci (i.e. each locus will place that person into a group that contains many other 
people) and yet have a unique DNA profile. This will occur if the combination of 
these relatively common attributes is found only in that person. Information on how 
DNA profiles are interpreted is given in Chapter 6, Section 6.4. 
 
Another example of data that are qualitative are the growth stages of true flies – 
egg, larva (with its three growth substages: the first, second and third instars), pupa 
and adult (Chapter 12, Box 12.1). In contrast to categories of illicit drugs, these 
data have an underlying order. Qualitative data that have such an order are said to 
be ordinal while those that do not are termed nominal.
 
Unlike qualitative data, quantitative data convey information about size or 
quantity. As shown in Figure 13.1, two forms of quantitative data are recognised, 
continuous and discrete. Continuous data, also called measurements, are those 
that can have any value in a range of allowed values. For example, the percentage 
of diamorphine in street heroin, can, in theory at least, have any value between 0 
and 100 per cent. In contrast, discrete quantitative data (also known as counts) 
can have only integer (i.e. whole number) values and are generated by counting the 
number of observations that occur within different nominal or ordinal categories. 
For example, if a corpse were discovered and the number of true flies found on it in 
each of their growth stages were known, then this numerical information would be 
discrete quantitative data. As described in Section 13.1.2, it is possible to transform 
continuous data into discrete quantitative data by classifying the data into discrete 
categories and counting the number of data points in each category. Note that, 
as indicated in Figure 13.1, qualitative data, whether nominal or ordinal, are also 
classified as discrete.
 
In addition to the classification summarised in Figure 13.1, it is useful to 
differentiate between constants and variables. Constants are items of data that have 
one fixed value each – although for constants with units, the number used to express 
that value will change if the units are changed. For example, the speed of light in

a vacuum is a constant with a value of 299 792 458 m s–1, which, on the basis of 
there being 3600 seconds in an hour and 1609.344 metres in a mile, is the same as  
670 616 629 miles per hour. In contrast to a constant, a variable is data of any of 
the types shown in Figure 13.1 and that can have any one of a number of values, 
although often within certain limits. For example, the angle of impact between a 
drop of blood and a wall is a variable that can have any positive value that is <90 °. 
Both constants and variables are commonly represented by symbols. These are 
normally either letters of the English or Greek alphabets and are conventionally 
written in italics. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum is conventionally 
symbolised as c, whereas, most commonly, an angle is represented as q.
 
In the analytical aspects of forensic science in particular, as well as in science in 
general, it is common to plot graphs to show how variations in one variable alter the 
values of another variable. To create these graphs, the scientist repeatedly alters 
one of these variables from one known value to the next while recording the value 
of the other variable. The variable that is under the direct control of the scientist is 
called the independent variable, while the other is termed the dependent variable. 
Conventionally, the independent and dependent variables are plotted on the x (i.e. 
horizontal) and y (i.e. vertical) axes, respectively. An important application of this 
is the creation of the calibration graphs that are central to the quantification of a 
wide range of analytes of forensic interest. In these, the independent variable is the 
concentration of the analyte in question and the dependent variable is the response 
of the instrument being used to perform the analysis. An example of this is given in 
Chapter 7, Box 7.5, in which the creation and use of a calibration graph is described 
within the context of atomic absorption and emission spectroscopies, which can be 
used to quantify metallic poisons. The creation of calibration graphs is returned to 
in Section 13.3, where a statistical method for establishing where it is best to draw 
the line on a straight-line graph is described.
13.1.2  Normally distributed data
Frequency is the name given to the number of times that a given event happens or 
value occurs. Under certain circumstances, a study of the frequency of past events 
or occurrences can lead to knowledge of how common these events or occurrences 
are, have been and will be. This is probability information (see Box 13.1 for a 
definition of probability), and it is powerful in a number of ways. For example, it can 
also be used to assess the confidence that should be placed in a given interpretation 
of experimental results. Also, this information allows the relative probabilities of 
the observed evidence occurring given the alternative explanations proposed by the 
prosecution and defence in court. These applications of probability information are 
explored later in this chapter, while this section is concerned with an important 
illustration of how this information can be obtained from a study of frequency data.
 
Take, for example, a hypothetical case involving the analysis of a sample of blood 
for its ethanol concentration, the true value of which (symbolised as m) is exactly 
81 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood. Assuming the absence of systematic or gross 
errors, the measurement of this continuous variable would still be the subject 
of random error (see Section 13.2 for a discussion of the various types of error 
and Section 13.1.1 for the meaning of the terms continuous and variable). The 
consequence of this random error is that the result (symbolised as x) of any one single 
analysis is unlikely to be a figure that exactly equals m. Assume that a data set (i.e. a 
group of data points) has been created by performing a number of repeated analyses

on the same sample of blood, using the same analytical procedure. The data set 
produced contains a range of results, many, but not all, of which are close to m. Half of 
these data points are larger than m and half are smaller. Note that n is the symbol used 
for the number of data points in a data set and, in this case, n is very large.
 
To explore further the pattern of dispersal that the n values of x have about m, it 
would be valuable to generate a graph showing the frequency of different values of x. 
In this case, the data are continuous. Consequently, even though n is large, it is most 
probable that each value of x would be unique. This means that, in this case, simply 
plotting x on the horizontal axis and the frequency of x (symbolised by fx) on the 
vertical axis would not generate a useful graph. Instead, all that this would produce 
is a straight horizontal line at a frequency of 1. Therefore, to produce a meaningful 
plot from continuous data such as this, it is necessary to group the data into discrete 
categories, called classes or bins. Each of these classes (which may be symbolised g) 
spans a range of values (i.e. it has a width, w), which touches but does not overlap 
the range of values of its nearest neighbour classes. Each data point (i.e. each value 
In the context of forensic science, probability is a 
rationally assessed measure of how certain it is that a 
given assertion is true. such assessments can be made 
only if the assertion concerned is one that is either 
true or false. this is exemplified by the statement that 
’the person observed at the scene was male’. however, 
the degree of certainty with which we can state that 
the assertion is true will depend on the available 
evidence. In other words, the probability is conditional 
on the evidence that is both available and taken into 
account.
 
two different but equivalent scales are used to 
express probabilities. one of these extends from 0 to 
1, and the other, which is derived from the first by 
multiplying by 100, runs from 0 to 100 per cent. on 
either scale, 0 means that, on the basis of the evidence 
used, it is certain that the assertion is not true. At the 
opposite extreme, a probability of 1 (i.e. 100 per cent) 
means that, based on the evidence used, it is known 
with absolute certainty that the assertion is true. In 
the example given in the previous paragraph, if the 
only evidence available is that half of the population is 
male, then the probability that the assertion is true is 
0.5 (i.e. 50 per cent).
 
Odds are another means of expressing the same 
information as that embodied in probability. Using the 
scale of probability that ranges from 0 to 1, and letting 
A stand for the assertion concerned and P(A) stand for 
the probability that A is true, then:
 
P(A)
the odds in favour of A = ––––––––
 
(1 – P(A))
for example, in the case in question, on the basis of the 
available information, the odds in favour of the assertion 
that the person seen at the scene was male are:
 0.5 
0.5 
1
–––––––– = –––– = ––
 (1 – 0.5) 0.5 
1
that is, odds of 1 to 1.
 
odds can be converted to probability, thus: if the 
odds in favour of x are a to b, then: 
 
a
probability of x = –––––––
 
 
 
 (a + b)
for example, the odds in favour of the assertion that 
the person seen at the scene was male are 1 to 1, and 
therefore the probability of this is 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5 or 50 
per cent.

of x) within the data set is then allocated to one of these categories, a process that 
may be referred to as classification. This is done such that each data point within 
any one class will have a value that falls within the range of the class concerned. 
The number of data points in each class can now be counted and is called the class 
frequency (fg). By this means, the data have been transformed from measurements 
into counts. That is, the data have been changed from continuous quantitative 
data to discrete quantitative data. Provided that the value for w was chosen to be 
the same for all classes (which it was in this case), Equation 13.1 can be used to 
calculate the relative frequency (rfg) of a given class from its value of fg:
  
fg
rfg = ––––––  
Eq 13.1
  
w × n
This calculation can then be repeated for each class and a histogram can be plotted 
with the classes on the horizontal axis, each touching its nearest neighbour(s), and 
the relative frequency on the vertical axis. Figure 13.2 shows such a histogram for 
the case in question.
 
If n is very large, as it is in this instance, this allows a large number of classes, 
each of narrow width, to be used when plotting the histogram. The larger the value 
of n, the narrower and more numerous the classes can be and the smoother and 
less step-like the line made by the tops of the columns becomes. Ultimately, it will 
become a smooth line as shown, for the case in question, in Figure 13.3.

At this point it is useful to introduce the concepts of populations and samples. 
In the statistical sense, the word population refers to all of the observations of 
the type being made, whether measurements or counts, that could be made on the 
item or group of related items under study. It is a self-contained and complete data 
set. For example, in the case in question, the population would be the results of 
the largest conceivable number of repeated analyses on the same sample of blood, 
using the same analytical procedure. In the context of statistics, the word sample 
means a collection of measurements or counts that is a subset of the population. 
In analytical science, the term sample has a slightly different meaning as it refers 
to the item being analysed. In many instances, this will be a part of a larger bulk 
of material (e.g. part of a paint flake recovered from a crime scene). Clearly, some 
care is needed in order to avoid confusion between these two meanings, although 
from the context in which the term is used the meaning is generally clear.
 
The data presented in Figure 13.2 are derived from a sample, albeit an unusually 
large one, whereas those shown in Figure 13.3 are from the population. Notice that 
although the vertical axis in Figure 13.2 is relative frequency, the same axis in Figure 
13.3 is labelled as either relative frequency or probability density and, hence, Figure 
13.3 is a probability density curve. Such curves are important because they can be 
used to establish the probability of a given event happening or a given value occurring. 
To illustrate how this is done, the probability in the case in question of any one single 
analysis result being 80 mg or less of ethanol per 100 ml of blood is described below.
 
The total area under a probability density curve is 1. This is the total probability 
of all possibilities represented on the graph occurring. Therefore, the shaded area in 
Figure 13.4 is the probability that any one single measurement, taken at random from 
all possible such measurements, has a value of ≤80 mg/100 ml. As this shaded portion 
has an area of 0.2514, there is a 25.14 per cent probability of this event occurring.
 
Importantly, the curve shown in Figures 13.3 and 13.4 is a normal distribution curve. 
A normal distribution curve is one that is defined as conforming to Equation 13.2:

in which there are two variables other than x. These are m, which is the mean of the 
population, and the population’s standard deviation, σ; which are defined in Boxes 
13.2 and 13.3, respectively. (Note: π is the constant 3.141 59… .) In the example under 
consideration, the value of m is 81 mg per 100 ml and that of σ is 1.5 mg per 100 ml.
 
All normal distribution curves are bell-shaped, with the value of x equal to m 
at that point on the curve where the probability density is at its maximum value. 
Normal distribution curves vary in their heights and widths, depending on their 
values of σ. Those with small values of σ are tall and narrow, while those that are 
short and wide have large σ values. To illustrate these effects, Figure 13.5 shows two 
normal distribution curves, both with m = 10 but one with σ = 1 and the other with 
σ = 3. From this it can be seen that for normally distributed data, m determines the 
location of the central point of the data set and σ is a measure of the dispersion of 
the data (see Boxes 13.2 and 13.3, respectively, for more information about these 
and other measures of location and dispersion).
 
One of the key features of a normal distribution curve is that the area under it 
between any two values of x can be calculated. For example, as shown in Figure 13.6, 
between x1= m – 1.00 × σ and x2= m + 1.00 × σ, the area has been calculated to be 
0.682. As this area is the probability of any one data point taken at random from the 
population having a value between x1 and x2, this means that 68.2 per cent of the 
data points of the population reside within ±1.00σ of the mean. Furthermore, the 
remainder of the data points must reside in the two tails of the curve that are more 
than one standard deviation from the population mean. As the normal distribution 
curve is symmetrical about the population mean, this implies that each tail contains 
(100 – 68.2)/2 = 15.9 per cent of the data points. Further commonly encountered 
examples of known areas under the normal distribution curve are given in Table 13.1.

In many instances, a quantitative data set (whether 
made up of measurements or counts) can be thought 
of as containing data that are distributed in some 
way about a central point. this central point can be 
envisaged both as being an expression of the typical 
value of the variable that is being measured and 
as defining the location of the data set concerned. 
several types of central points, all known as averages, 
may be defined. those in common use are the arith-
metic mean, the median and the mode. these are 
defined and discussed briefly below.
Arithmetic mean (known as the mean)
this is the most commonly calculated average and what 
is most often meant when the word ’average’ is used. It 
is the sum of all of the individual data points (x) in the 
data set divided by the number of data points (n) that 
it contains. that is:
mean = 
Sx
––– 
n
for example, if the refractive indices of four fragments 
of glass recovered from the coat of a suspect were 
found to be 1.511 56, 1.511 50, 1.511 62 and 1.511 60, 
the mean value would be:
1.511 56 + 1.511 50 + 1.511 62 + 1.511 60
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– = 1.511 57

note that distinction is drawn between the mean of 
a population and the mean of a sample. these are 
symbolised m (pronounced ’mew’) and x– (pronounced ’x 
bar’), respectively. the value of x– for a sample taken from 
a given population is an estimate of that population’s m.
 
variation of data points away from the mean may 
be due to random errors (section 13.2) inherent in the 
measurement. If this is the sole source of variation, 
then m is the true value of the variable being measured.
for example, consider the repeated analysis of 
a single uniform piece of cannabis resin for its 
D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-thC) concentration. 
provided that true population data can be collected 
and the only error is random error, then the mean 
value of the analytical results of the repeats will be 
the true concentration of D9-thC in that piece. note, 
however, that m is not always the true value, even when 
the only type of error is random error. this happens 
when the parameter being measured varies across the 
population, so no single true value exists. Under these 
circumstances, m is a parameter that characterises 
the population as a whole. for example, consider 
a population that is made up of assorted pieces of 
cannabis resin, each of which is analysed for its D9-thC 
concentration. even if each piece is uniform in terms 
of the concentration of this component, random error 
cannot be the sole source of variation if the actual 
concentration of D9-thC varies from one piece of resin 
to the next. therefore, m is a property of the population 
and not a true value of the D9-thC concentration.
Median
this is the central value when the data are placed in 
order of increasing value (or the mean of the two central 
values if there is an even number of data points). for 
example, if the number of minutiae in each of nine 
fingerprints was found when placed in ascending order 
to be 16, 17, 18, 20, 20, 25, 26, 28 and 33, the central 
value is 20, which is therefore the median of this data 
set. note that the position of the centre can be found by 
counting j data points from either end of the list of data 
points, where j = (n + 1) × 0.50 and n is the number of 
data points in the data set.
 
In instances in which the data are skewed (i.e. 
not distributed symmetrically about the mean), the 
median is often used instead of the mean to provide an 
average value.
Mode
this is simply the most common value. for example, 
if the number of minutiae in each of nine fingerprints 
was found to be 16, 28, 20, 33, 17, 20, 18, 26 and 
25, the mode would be 20. this is because this value, 
which would be referred to as the modal value, appears 
twice while each of the others appears only once. 
 
In continuous data, identical values are rarely 
found. however, in the absence of such values, a mode 
can be established if the data are grouped into classes

counting j1 and j2 data points from the start of the

= (n + 1) × 0.75. for example, if the percentage of

of increasing value, found to be 25.6 per cent, 27.6 
per cent, 30.4 per cent, 31.3 per cent, 32.9 per 
cent and 36.9 per cent, j1 would be (6 + 1) × 0.25

first quartile would be 27.1 per cent as this is three- 
quarters of the way between 25.6 per cent and 27.6 per 
cent (i.e. 25.6% + ((27.6% – 25.6%) × 0.75) = 27.1%). 
similarly, the third quartile would be one-quarter the 
way between 32.9 per cent and 36.9 per cent, that is 
33.9 per cent (i.e. 32.9% + ((36.9% – 32.9%) × 0.25) 
= 33.9%). this would establish the interquartile range 
in this instance to be 33.9% – 27.1% = 6.8%.

13.1.3  Confidence limits and confidence intervals
Let us return to the hypothetical example concerning blood–alcohol concentration 
that was introduced in Section 13.1.2. In the UK, driving with a blood–alcohol 
concentration of more than 80 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood is an offence under 
current legislation (Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2). It has already been noted that if a 
single determination of the ethanol content of the blood concerned were performed, 
then there is a real possibility that the result (x) would be a false negative. That is, 
it would produce a value of less that 80 mg per 100 ml, despite the fact that the true 
value (m) is more than this figure. The probability of this false negative occurring 
can be reduced by using x– in place of x as the estimate of the true blood–alcohol 
concentration. In this, the value x– would be the mean of a sample, consisting of a 
number (n) of values of x, generated by repeating the measurement several times.
 
To see why this works, recall that the true value of the blood–alcohol concentration 
is exactly 81 mg per 100 ml and the standard deviation (σ) for the population of 
measurements of this variable is 1.5 mg per 100 ml. If a very large number (i.e. a 
population) of values of x– were established, these would have a normal distribution. 
This would have the same mean as that of the population of x, that is m. However, 
the standard deviation of the population of x– values would be lower than that of the 
population of x. The standard deviation of a population of means equals the standard 
error of the mean (symbolised SE), which is calculated using Equation 13.3:
  
σ
SE = –––  
Eq 13.3
  
n
 
where σ is the standard deviation of the population of x and n is the number of 
values of x in each sample.
 
From Equation 13.3, and as illustrated in Figure 13.7, it can be seen that the 
larger the sample size (i.e. the higher the value of n), the taller and narrower the 
probability distribution becomes. This means that the uncertainty associated with 
x– as an estimate of m decreases as n increases. Figure 13.7 illustrates this using the 
hypothetical case in question. From this, it can be seen that whereas 25.14 per cent 
of single measurements will be below 80 mg per 100 ml, the proportion of values of 
x– below this figure is decreased to 6.81 per cent if the value of n is 5 and 1.74 per 
cent if the value of n is 10. 
 
Clearly, in real life, the value of m is not known. Instead, the best estimate that 
is available is x–. It would be useful if it were possible to calculate an expression of 
the uncertainty associated with this estimate. Confidence limits and confidence 
intervals are attempts to do this. To set confidence limits, it is necessary to choose 
a confidence level. Traditionally, such levels are set at either 95 per cent or 99 per 
cent, although these figures have no particular merit in the general sense and the 
analyst should decide on the confidence level to be used in a particular case based 
on the circumstances of that case. For the sake of argument, let us assume that the 
desired confidence level is 95 per cent. From Table 13.1 it can be seen that 95 per 
cent of a normally distributed population resides within m ± 1.96 × σ and recall that 
the standard deviation of a population of means equals its standard error (= σ/
 n). 
From this, it is argued that the lower 95 per cent confidence limit is given by Equation 
13.4 and the upper limit by Equation 13.5:

 
DAtA n 417
lower 95 per cent confidence limit = x– – (1.96 × σ/
 
n) 
Eq 13.4
upper 95 per cent confidence limit = x– + (1.96 × σ/
 
n) 
Eq 13.5
From this, the 95 per cent confidence interval spans from the first of these limits to 
the second, that is:
95 per cent confidence interval = x– ± (1.96 × σ/
 
n) 
Eq 13.6
Note that the confidence limits and confidence interval at confidence levels other 
than 95 per cent can be calculated. This is done by replacing 1.96 in Equations

w per cent of the data of a normal distribution, where w per cent is the desired

Notice that when calculating confidence limits or confidence intervals, the 
standard deviation of the population (σ) has been needed. It is relatively rare that 
this information is available. More commonly, the only estimate of σ available is s, 
the standard deviation of the sample. This can be used to estimate the standard 
error of the mean (SE) of the population by substituting s for σ in Equation 13.3. 
To differentiate between the SE calculated using σ and its estimate calculated 
using s, the estimate may be referred to as the standard uncertainty (u), which is 
calculated by Equation 13.7:
 
s
u = ––– 
Eq 13.7
 
 n
Note that many authors refer to both SE and u (as defined by Equations 13.3 and 
13.7, respectively) as being the standard error of the mean (SE), with the context of 
its use allowing the reader to discern the meaning.
 
Using s as an estimate of σ broadens the distribution of x–, so that it is no longer 
normally distributed. This means that for a given confidence level (w per cent) and 
sample size (n), the confidence interval has to broaden too. The statistic t is used 
to allow for this and the confidence interval (CI) is calculated by means of Equation 
13.8, the lower and upper confidence limits being given by Equations 13.9 and 
13.10, respectively:
CI = x– ± (t × s/
 
n) = x– ± t × u 
Eq 13.8
lower confidence limit = x– – (t × s/
 
n) = x– – t × u 
Eq 13.9
upper confidence limit = x– + (t × s/
 
n) = x– + t × u 
Eq 13.10
For each of Equations 13.8–13.10, the appropriate value of t is found from tables 
such as that shown in Table 13.2. To find this value of t, two parameters are 
required. One of these is the confidence level, which has exactly the same meaning 
as described before. The other is the number of degrees of freedom (df), which for 
confidence limit and confidence interval calculations is n – 1. It is also necessary 
to know whether it is the one-tailed or the two-tailed value of t that is required. 
To calculate confidence limits and confidence intervals, the two-tailed value of t 
is needed. Now, using Table 13.2, the column headed with the chosen confidence 
level and the correct number of tails is selected, as is the row with df = n – 1. At 
the intersection of this column and row is the value of t required to calculate the 
confidence interval or confidence limits.
 
As shown in Table 13.2, the columns may be headed by the significance level (a) 
in place of the confidence level. Indeed, in many publications that provide tables 
of t, only the value of a is written at the heads of the columns. It is, therefore, 
important to know that for a given value of a, on a scale of 0 to 1, the corresponding 
confidence level in per cent is (1 – a) × 100, or, if a and confidence levels are in per 
cent, then the corresponding confidence level is 100 – a. For example, an a of 0.05 
or 5 per cent equals a confidence level of 95 per cent.
 
It is important to understand what confidence limits and confidence intervals 
represent. Consider a w per cent (e.g. 95 per cent) confidence interval based on a 
sample of n measurements. What this means is that if a population of samples were 
taken, each containing n measurements (with each measurement made using the 
same method), w per cent of the means of these samples would reside within the 
confidence interval, that is between the w per cent confidence limits. It also means 

 
pReCIsIon, ACCURACy AnD eRRoR n 419
that if one were to predict that for any given sample its mean would reside between 
these confidence limits, then one would be correct w per cent of the time. This is 
commonly interpreted as meaning that there is w per cent chance of m being within 
the w per cent confidence limits and, although this is strictly speaking incorrect, it 
is in frequent usage.
13.2 Precision, accuracy and error 
In analytical science, the terms precision, accuracy and error have specific 
meanings. These meanings are explored in this section.
 
Precision is how reproducible a given measurement is. If repeat or replicate 
measurements1 produce results that are close together, the data are described as 
being precise (i.e. having high precision), the opposite being imprecise (i.e. having 
low precision).

The standard deviation of a sample of measurements (s) is a gauge of its 
precision. If the depth of tread on a car tyre was measured repeatedly and the data 
generated were found to have a standard deviation of 0.1mm, then this would be 
more precise than a similar set of measurements of car tyre tread depth that had a 
standard deviation of 0.9 mm. 
 
However, it is important to keep in mind the size of the mean of the  
measurements when using standard deviation as a gauge of data quality. For 
example, consider two different sets of repeated measurements of the depth of 
tread on a given location on each of two different car tyres. If these two sets of 
measurements have the same standard deviation but different means, then the data 
set with the smaller mean is arguably of poorer quality. This is because although 
the absolute value of the standard deviation is the same in both instances, its value 
relative to the size of the mean is larger in the case of the measurement set with the 
smaller mean. In other words, of the two data sets, this one has the lower relative 
precision. The measure of this is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.
 
Two parameters based on this ratio are in common use as alternative gauges 
of relative precision. These parameters, the coefficient of variation (CV) and the 
relative standard deviation (RSD), are defined in Box 13.4. For each of these, 
the larger the value of the parameter (ignoring any negative sign in front of the 
value), the lower the relative precision. For example, the CV and %RSD of a set of 
measurements of the depth of tread on one location on a car tyre with a mean of 
5.1mm and a standard deviation of 0.1mm will be 2 per cent. If the depth of tread 
on a single location on another car tyre is repeatedly measured, producing a mean 
the coefficient of variation (CV) may be defined as:
CV = s–– 
x–  × 100%
the relative standard deviation (RSD) is defined by:
RSD = s
––– 
|x–|
this is often expressed in parts per thousand (ppt), 
thus:
RSD = s
––– 
|x–| × 1000 ppt
or as per cent (known as %RSD), thus:
RSD = s
––– 
|x–| × 100%
In the equations given above, s is the standard deviation 
of the sample, x– is its mean and |x–| is the absolute value 
of its mean. the absolute value of the mean is its value 
given as a positive number irrespective of whether it  
is positive or negative, for example the absolute value of 
a mean of 0.43 is 0.43, as is the absolute value of a  
mean of –0.43.
 
note that the CV will always have the same sign as 
the mean used to calculate it. In contrast, the RSD, as 
defined above, will be positive irrespective of the sign 
of the mean. 
 
Unfortunately, there is potential for confusion as 
there is also another, equally valid, definition of RSD 
in use. In this alternative definition, x– is used in 
place of |x–| in the equations given above. Although 
this makes no difference to the RSD of samples that 
have positive means, the two versions produce RSD 
values with different signs for samples that have 
negative means.

measurement of 1.1mm but the same standard deviation as before, the CV and 
%RSD of this second data set is 9 per cent. This higher value of the CV and %RSD 
reflects the lower relative precision of the second data set.
 
Accuracy is how near a given measurement, or average (usually the mean) of 
several repeat or replicate measurements, is to the true or accepted value. If the 
difference between the measured and true or accepted value is small, then the 
measurement (or average measurement) is said to be accurate, the opposite being 
inaccurate. 
 
Error is an expression of inaccuracy. Both absolute error (E) and relative error 
(Er) are recognised; these are defined by Equations 13.11 and 13.12, respectively:
E = x – xt 
Eq 13.11
Er = x – xt
 ––––– 
xt
 
Eq 13.12
where x is the measurement that has been made and xt is the true (or accepted) 
value. Note that the relative error is usually expressed as a percentage, that is:
Er = x – xt
 ––––– 
xt
 × 100%
 
Eq 13.13
or as parts per thousand (ppt), thus:
Er = x – xt
 ––––– 
xt
 × 1000 ppt
 
Eq 13.14
In replicate or repeat determinations, the E or Er of the mean is the error of 
interest. In which case, x in Equations 13.11–13.14 inclusive is simply replaced 
by x–. As a consequence of the way in which error is defined in these equations, a 
negative value of E or Er means that x (or x–) < xt and a positive value of E or Er 
means that x (or x–) > xt.
 
As with the concept of relative precision introduced earlier in this section, the 
advantage of relative error as a gauge of data quality is that the context of the 
measurement is taken into account. To return to the example of car tyre tread 
depth measurements, if the mean measurement was 5.1 mm but the true value was 
5.0 mm, this mean would have an absolute error of 0.1 mm. This would also be 
the case if the true value was 1.0 mm and the mean measured value was 1.1 mm. 
However, the relative errors would be different, namely 2.0 per cent (i.e. 20 ppt) and 
10.0 per cent (i.e. 100 ppt). From this, it can be seen that although the absolute 
error is the same in both cases, the latter is more inaccurate in the context of the 
size of the true value and so is arguably a poorer-quality item of data.
 
In analytical science, several different types of error are recognised. These are 
described below.
 
Systematic errors (also called determinate errors) cause the value of the 
measurement (or mean of replicate or repeat measurements) to be consistently 
high or low and so decrease accuracy. Each such error has a specific origin. They 
can be subdivided into the following:
Accuracy 
An expression of 
how near a given 
measurement, or 
average (usually the 
mean) of several 
repeat or replicate 
measurements, is to 
the true or accepted 
value.
Error 
An expression of 
inaccuracy.
Systematic errors
Errors that each 
cause the value of 
the measurement  
(or mean of 
replicate or repeat 
measurements) to 
be consistently high 
or low. Also called 
determinate errors.

n Personal errors. These occur because the analyst misjudges the outcome of 
a test in a way that consistently over- or underevaluates the measurement 
or count being made. For example, consider the measurement of tyre tread 
depth by placing a ruler into the tread well and reading the scale where it 
meets the outermost surface of the tyre. This could be subject to personal 
determinate error if the person taking the reading does so while looking 
along a line that it not perpendicular to the ruler. Such errors may be 
minimised by using equipment that requires little in the way of judgement 
on the part of the person making the measurement.
n Instrument errors. These occur because the equipment used produces 
readings that consistently over- or underevaluate the measurement or count 
being made, for example, a volumetric pipette that delivers a greater volume 
than indicated. These can often be eliminated by establishing the true value 
that corresponds to that indicated by the instrument or by adjusting the 
instrument such that the indicated value is the true value.
n Method errors. These occur because some aspect of the materials used 
to conduct the analysis responds in a suboptimal fashion, leading to a 
consistent over- or underevaluation of the measurement or count being 
made. For example, presumptive tests, such as those used to indicate the 
likely presence of blood or certain types of drugs, are often non-specific. 
That is, they will produce a positive result with substances other than that 
being tested for. Consider what would happen if a presumptive test for the 
presence of a particular substance were used to produce a count of the 
instances of occurrence of that substance. This would tend to lead to a result 
that was higher than the true value, assuming that the test always produced 
a positive result in the presence of the substance in question. Detection 
of, and correction for, method errors is not easy in all cases. However, the 
appropriate use of control experiments (those designed to establish that the 
response produced by the test is not spurious) and confirmatory tests (i.e. 
conducting the analysis using two or more completely different methods and 
comparing results) can minimise their impact.
Some systematic errors cause the relative error to increase as the quantity being 
determined gets smaller. These are constant errors. Other determinate errors 
do not cause the relative error to vary as the quantity being measured changes 
in size. These are proportional errors. Random errors (also called indeterminate 
errors) cause dispersion of replicate or repeat measurements about the mean 
measurement. Such errors decrease the precision of a set of replicate or repeat 
measurements or counts.
 
Gross errors are due to mistakes or unusual events (e.g. an electrical power 
surge). Gross errors often produce outliers (i.e. data points that are radically far 
from the mean value compared with those generated by other replicates or repeats) 
but can affect all replicates or repeats of a determination.

13.3 Regression analysis
As mentioned in Section 13.1.1, there are many analytical techniques that require 
calibration graphs to be constructed and used. In most applications, in order to 
construct such a graph, a series of standards is produced, each standard containing 
a different but known concentration (or, in some instances, amount) of the analyte. 
(The term analyte means the chemical that is to be analysed for.) The analytical 
procedure is then conducted on each standard; each time this is done, the response 
of the analytical system is noted. In most cases, this response is a number produced 
by the analytical equipment being employed.
 
The calibration graph is then constructed by plotting the analyte concentration 
(or amount) on the horizontal (x) axis against the system’s response, which is 
plotted on the vertical (y) axis. A best-fit line is then drawn through the data points. 
 
This graph can then be used to find the concentration (or amount) of analyte 
present in a sample. To do this, the analytical procedure is carried out on the 
sample and the system’s response is noted. The point on the y-axis where this 
response lies is found and a line parallel to the x-axis is drawn from this point until 
it intersects with the line of best fit. A line that is parallel to the y-axis is then drawn 
from this point of intersection to the x-axis. The value of x where this vertical line 
crosses the horizontal axis is noted as the concentration (or amount) of analyte in 
the sample. This process is exemplified by the calibration procedure described in 
Chapter 7, Box 7.5. 
 
The accuracy of this process is clearly reliant on establishing exactly where the 
line of best fit lies. Regression analysis is a statistical method for finding this. It 
quantifies the relationship between one variable and another on which it depends. 
There are a number of types of regression analysis. However, the one described 
here is linear regression. This calculates the position of the straight line of best fit 
through a scatter graph and so is not applicable to situations in which it is believed 
that the best-fit line is curved. There are non-linear forms of regression analysis that 
can be used in such situations, although these are not discussed here.
 
All straight lines have the equation:
y = mx + c 
Eq 13.15
in which x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable, m is a constant 
that is the slope of the line and c, which is also a constant, is the value of y when 
x = 0. 
 
In the case of the general calibration graph that is described above, x is the 
concentration (or amount) of analyte and y is the system’s response.
 
During linear regression analysis, the following are calculated:
n The regression coefficient. This is m for the straight line of best fit. It is 
calculated using Equation 13.16:
  
m = S(x – x–)(y – y–) 
 ––––––––––––––––
S(x – x–)2
 
Eq 13.16
n The regression constant. This is c for the straight line of best fit. It is 
calculated using Equation 13.17:

 
 424 n stAtIstICs AnD the AnAlysIs, InteRpRetAtIon AnD evAlUAtIon of evIDenCe
c = y– – mx–  
Eq 13.17
Once the values of m and c have been found, the straight line of best fit has 
been defined for the scatter graph in question. Now, for any given value of y, the 
corresponding value of x can be calculated by rearranging Equation 13.15 to give 
Equation 13.18:
x = (y – c) 
 –––––––
m
 
Eq 13.18
This removes the need to construct those lines that are parallel to the x- and y-axes 
and that are described earlier in this section, as the concentration (or amount) of 
analyte in the sample can be found directly by calculation.
 
An example of the use of linear regression analysis in this context is given in Box 
13.5, as is the corresponding scatter graph with the straight line of best fit shown.
flame photometry is an analytical technique that can 
be used to determine the concentration of certain 
metals in solution. It requires the calibration of the 
instrument used (a flame photometer) each time an 
analysis is performed.
 
Consider a hypothetical case in which a flame 
photometer was to be used to analyse the calcium 
content of water found in a drinking glass at a crime 
scene. Before use, the photometer was calibrated 
using standards that were samples of water containing 
calcium of known concentration (which in this case was 
measured in parts per million, ppm). these standards 
were entered into the photometer sequentially and, 
for each one, the reading given by the instrument was 
noted. these instrument readings have no units. the 
data generated are given in the table below.

the water from the crime scene was found to give 
an instrument reading of 31. A scatter graph of the 
calibration data was drawn (see below), which clearly 
indicated that the optimum shape for the best-fit line 
through the data would be a straight line. 
 
As described in section 13.3 of the main text, all 
straight lines accord with the equation y = mx + c. 
linear regression was used to establish the values of m 
and x in this case, as described below.

It should be noted that linear regression analysis is based on a number of 
assumptions, namely:
1. the values of x are known with complete accuracy (i.e. no error);
2. if the values of y that correspond to each value of x were also known without 
error, then the points on the graph would fall on a straight line;
3. that multiple measurements of the value of y for a given value of x would be 
normally distributed about the true mean of y at that value of x;
4. that as x alters, the variance associated with each of the values of y remains 
constant.
Finally, a calibration graph that is one shape (e.g. a straight line) in one range 
of concentrations (or amounts) of analyte may become another shape at other 
concentrations. This cannot be seen unless the scatter graph is extended into those 
As in this case, the calcium concentration is the 
independent variable and the instrument reading is 
the dependent variable; these were designated as x 
and y, respectively (see section 13.1.1 for definitions 
of independent and dependent variables). the means 
x– and y– were then calculated to be 10 ppm and 52, 
respectively, and the calculations indicated in the 
following table were carried out.

As indicated above, the totals of the last two

the value of c was then found using equation 13.17:

 equation 13.17
thus:
c = y– – m x– = 52 – 5.22 × 10 = –0.2
the equation of the regression line is therefore:
y = 5.22x – 0.2
A plot of this line is shown in the graph given below. 
this illustrates that this line does indeed fit the data

13.4 Hypothesis testing using t-tests
The ideas in this section are founded on those introduced in Section 13.1.3. 
Therefore, it might be advisable to read that section before tackling this one.
 
A hypothesis is a reasoned explanation of observations. Consider two samples, 
each made up of measurements of the same variable. One of these samples could 
be, for example, made up of measurements of the refractive indices of a number 
(n1) of fragments of glass from a crime scene. Similarly, the other sample could 
be the refractive indices of a number (n2) of glass fragments recovered from the 
clothing of a suspect. (Note that the subscripted numbers in the symbols n1 and n2 
are there to differentiate between the two data sets.) If the means of these samples 
are different, then there are two possible hypotheses to explain this, namely:
n that this observation is due to chance alone;
n that this observation is not due to chance alone.
The first of these is the null hypothesis (H0), and the second is the alternative 
hypothesis (HA). In this case, if we knew the true values for the means and H0 were 
correct, then m1 – m2 = 0, but if HA were correct, then m1 – m2 ≠ 0. Hence, in this 
case the equations m1 – m2 = 0 and m1 – m2 ≠ 0 can be considered as statements of 
H0 and HA, respectively. A t-test can be used to establish whether, at a particular 
confidence level, there is sufficient evidence to reject m1 – m2 = 0 and accept m1 – m2 
≠ 0. In other words, a t-test is a test to establish the significance that can be placed 
on the observation that there is a difference between two sample means.
 
To see how this can be done, consider two fairly large samples of n1 and n2 
observations respectively (to continue with the earlier example, these could be the 
refractive indices of n1 fragments of glass from a crime scene and n2 from a suspect). 
These samples will each have a mean (x–
1 and x–
2) and a standard deviation (s1 and 
s2). Assuming that the populations from which n1 and n2 originate are normally 
distributed, as the number of observations in each sample is quite large, x–
1 and x–
2 will 
be reasonably good approximations for m1 and m2 respectively. Similarly, s1 and s2 will 
be fairly accurate estimates of σ1 and σ2 respectively. These estimates can be used to 
generate good approximations of the normal distributions for each population.
 
Recall from Section 13.1.3 that if a population-sized number of samples is taken 
from a normally distributed population, then the distribution of the means of these 
samples will itself be normal. This second normal distribution (i.e. the distribution of 
the means) will have a standard deviation that is the standard error of the mean (SE, 
given by Equation 13.3) and a mean that is the same as that of the population from 
which the samples are taken (i.e. m). As, in this example, n1 and n2 are large, in each 
case the standard uncertainty (u, given by Equation 13.7) will be a good estimate of 
the standard error of the mean. Figure 13.8 shows the estimated distributions of the 
populations from which n1 and n2 have been drawn and the estimated distribution of 
the means of repeated samples taken from these populations.
Null hypothesis (H0) 
The hypothesis 
that the observed 
difference between 
the samples (e.g. an 
observed difference 
between their 
means) is due to 
chance alone. 
Alternative 
hypothesis (HA)
The hypothesis 
that the observed 
difference between 
the samples (e.g. an 
observed difference 
between their 
means) is not due 
to chance alone.

The 95 per cent confidence intervals, calculated using Equation 13.8, of the two 
data sets are shown as shaded areas on Figure 13.8. Notice that in this case these 
do not overlap. This means that at a confidence level of more than 95 per cent, it is 
possible to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis. If the 
shaded areas had overlapped, it would have meant that it would not be possible to 
reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis at a 95 per cent 
confidence level.
 
It is quite possible to test for the difference between sample means as described 
above. However, it is more convenient to do this by examining the distribution of 
the differences between the means. Just as the confidence interval for the mean 
x– is given by x– ± t × u (Equation 13.8), the confidence interval for the difference 
between the means, x–
1 – x–
2, is given by (x–
1 – x–
2) ± t × SEx–
1–x–
2. In this, SEx–
1–x–
2 is the 
standard error for the difference between x–
1 and x–
2, as calculated from the variance 
and the number of data points in each sample (i.e. s1
2, s2
2, n1 and n2).
 
To understand how SEx–
1–x–
2 can be calculated, recall Equation 13.7 for the 
calculation of the standard uncertainty (u):
 
s
u = ––– 
Eq 13.7

Just as u is an estimate of the standard deviation of a population of means, u2 is an 
estimate of the variance of the population of means concerned and u2 is given by

and therefore, for each distribution of means, the shaded area shows where 95% of
the data points will reside, where each data point is a mean (see Section 13.1.3).

To the nearest whole number, this equals 6. From this, using Table 13.2, it can be 
seen that at a confidence level of 95 per cent (i.e. a significance level of 5 per cent 
or 0.05), t = 2.45.
 
Therefore:

2 = (5.50 – 3.75) ± 2.45 × 1.07
 
 = 1.75 ± 2.62 = –0.87 to 4.37 
Eq 13.23
This includes zero; therefore, it is not possible to exclude the possibility at a 95 per 
cent level of confidence that the null hypothesis (i.e. m1 – m2 = 0) is correct (let us 
call this conclusion 1). In other words, it is not possible to reject the null hypothesis 
in favour of the alternative hypothesis at a 95 per cent confidence level. If the range 
found by Equation 13.23 had not included zero, then this would mean that at a 
confidence level of more than 95 per cent it would be possible to reject the null 
hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis.
 
There is another equivalent, but more convenient, way of deciding whether the 
null hypothesis can be rejected at a given confidence level. 
 
Recall that the confidence interval (CI) of a sample at a given level of confidence 
(e.g. 95 per cent) is given by:
CI = x– ± t × u
In this, t × u is the deviation (d) either side of the mean, namely d = t × u. 
Therefore, for a given deviation from x–, t could be calculated thus:
 
d
t = – 
Eq 13.24
 
u
By extension of this logic, when considering the difference between means, x–

t can be calculated from:

This can be compared with the value of t obtained from a table of t (such as that 
given in Table 13.2) at the chosen level of confidence and the appropriate degrees 
of freedom, which, as before, is the nearest whole number to β as calculated using 
Equation 13.22. Such a value taken from a table of t is often referred to as the 

 
 430 n stAtIstICs AnD the AnAlysIs, InteRpRetAtIon AnD evAlUAtIon of evIDenCe
critical value of t and is frequently symbolised tcrit. If tcalc < tcrit, the null hypothesis 
cannot be rejected at the chosen level of confidence. However, if tcalc > tcrit, the null 
hypothesis can be rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis at the chosen level 
of confidence. When making such comparisons, tcalc is treated as if it had a positive 
value, irrespective of whether it is positive or negative (i.e. the absolute value of 
tcalc(symbolised |tcalc|) is used in place of tcalc itself).
 
To return to the example discussed above, as previously calculated, β = 5.59, 
which, to the nearest whole number, equals 6. At 6 degrees of freedom and at a  
95 per cent level of confidence, the tabulated value of t (i.e. tcrit) = 2.45. As tcalc < 
tcrit, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 95 per cent confidence level. This 
is exactly the same conclusion as conclusion 1. 
 
Note that the procedure described above that is based on Equations 13.22 and 
13.25 is an example of a two-sample t-test in which it is assumed that the variances 
of the two populations are not equal. Table 13.4 summarises the salient features of 
this and some other common forms of the t-test.
 
In Table 13.4 mention is made of both one- and two-tailed versions of the t-test. 
Which of these is performed will depend on the nature of the alternative hypothesis, 
HA. A one-tailed t-test would be carried out when the experiment is designed to test 
the null hypothesis against an alternative that implies direction. That is, HA would 
equal one of the following: 
m1 – m2 > 0 or m1 – m2 < 0 in the case of two-sample tests, or 
m – n > 0 or m – n < 0 in the case of one-sample tests.
However, a two-tailed test would be carried out when the experiment is designed to 
establish whether there is merely a significant difference between the means (i.e.  
m1 – m2 ≠ 0 or m – n ≠  0).
 
For example, if the diamorphine concentration of street heroin that was seized 
in any one year was found to be normally distributed, then a t-test could be used to 
test the significance that could be ascribed to a change in the mean diamorphine 
concentration observed from one year to another. A one-tailed test would be 
appropriate if the alternative hypothesis were that the concentration of diamorphine 
in street heroin seized in year one (e.g. 2006) is higher than that seized in year 
two (e.g. 2004), as in this case the alternative hypothesis would be m1 – m2 > 0. In 
contrast, a two-tailed test would be employed if the alternative hypothesis were that 
the concentration of diamorphine in street heroin seized in year one is different 
from that seized in year two (i.e. HA is that m1 – m2 ≠  0). In both cases, the null 
hypothesis would be that the mean diamorphine concentration was the same in 
both years (i.e. H0 is that m1 – m2 = 0).
 
Finally, it is important to realise that the level of confidence, in the context 
of a t-test, is the probability of not rejecting H0 in those instances in which H0 is 
true. For example, if the level of confidence is 95 per cent and if H0 is true, then 
in the long run 95 per cent of the times that the test is carried out H0 will not be 
rejected; however, on 5 per cent of occasions it will be wrongly rejected. This is not 
a particularly easy concept and, because of this, great care needs to be exercised 
when stating the outcome of a t-test. As outlined in Table 13.4, there are three 
possible outcomes, namely:

where w per cent is the confidence level at which the test was carried out. To 
illustrate how easy it is to make a mistake in this area, consider a case in which the 
correct statement is ‘H0 cannot be rejected in favour of HA at a confidence level of 
95 per cent’. This could be wrongly interpreted to mean that there is a 95 per cent 
probability that H0 is correct. If in doubt, proceed as follows:
1. Define what is meant in the case in question by each of H0 and HA.
2. Perform the appropriate t-test (see Table 13.4).
3. Select the one of the three bullet points given above that is applicable to the 
case in question and use the wording given, substituting the chosen level of 
confidence in place of w per cent.
13.5  Parametric and non-parametric tests
The t-test described in the previous section makes use of the actual values of the 
data points in the data sets that are being compared. Statistical tests that make use 
of actual values are called parametric tests. There are a number of such parametric 
tests, each designed to address different statistical needs.
 
Parametric tests are applicable to normally distributed data or data sets that can 
be made to be normally distributed by transformation (e.g. by taking logarithms 
of each of the values in the data set). However, there are types of data, including 
ordinal data (Section 13.1.1), that cannot be analysed by such tests. A range of 
non-parametric tests have been devised for cases in which parametric tests are not 
applicable, and for many parametric tests there is a non-parametric equivalent. For 
example, the Mann–Whitney test is a non-parametric equivalent of the unpaired 
two-sample t-test. Likewise, the Wilcoxon test is a non-parametric equivalent of the 
paired t-test and the one-sample t-test.
 
In general, in non-parametric tests the data are placed in ascending order 
and then each data point is assigned a rank number that denotes its position in 
that order. The non-parametric test in question then uses this rank and not the 
actual value of the data point. Note that as nominal data (Section 13.1.1) does not 
have values and cannot be placed in ranks, such data cannot be tested by either 
parametric or non-parametric tests.
 
Although it is generally true that data that can be subjected to parametric testing 
can also be analysed using the non-parametric equivalents, the former of these is 
chosen wherever possible. This is because parametric tests are, in most cases, more 
powerful than non-parametric tests.

13.6 Likelihood ratios and the 
 
Bayesian approach
Under cross-examination, the interpretation and evaluation of the scientific test 
results by the forensic scientist are likely to constitute the most significant area 
of contention (Chapter 14, Section 14.4). The opinion of the forensic scientist 
is formed by what he or she considers to be the most probable explanation of 
the results. However, the forensic scientist must be careful in the way that he or 
she expresses opinions. In particular, the forensic scientist should not make any  
statements that directly imply the guilt, or otherwise, of the defendant standing 
trial. Such decisions are the province of the jurors or magistrates hearing the case. 
 
One means by which a forensic scientist can express opinion is via the statement 
of a likelihood ratio. This can, by the application of Bayes’ theorem, help those 
hearing the case to establish the odds of the accused being guilty (the concept of 
odds is explained in Box 13.1, as is its relationship to probability). Unfortunately, 
this is not a particularly easy topic. In order to approach it, let us first consider 
what is meant by the term likelihood ratio (LR). This is defined as follows:
 
the probability of the evidence occurring given that  
 
a hypothesis is correct
LR = –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 
Eq 13.27
 
the probability of the evidence occurring given than an 
 
alternative hypothesis is correct
or, using symbols:
 
P(E|H1)
LR = ––––––––– 
Eq 13.28 
  
P(E|H2)
in which P stands for ‘the probability of’, E stands for ‘the evidence occurring’, 
| stands for ‘given’, H1 is the hypothesis under test and H2 is the alternative 
hypothesis.2
 
As shown in Table 13.5, a likelihood ratio of 1 means that the evidence supports 
neither the hypothesis nor the alternative hypothesis, and such evidence is said to 
have no probative value. Likelihood ratios greater than 1 support the hypothesis, 
whereas those less than 1 support the alternative hypothesis. The further the 
likelihood ratio is from 1, the greater is the probative value of the evidence. 
Likelihood ratio
The probability 
of the evidence 
occurring given 
that a hypothesis is 
correct divided by 
the probability of the 
evidence occurring 
given that an 
alternative 
hypothesis is 
correct.
2 The hypotheses that are used in likelihood ratios must meet specific requirements. Furthermore, 
hypotheses that are fit for use in the evaluation of evidence using such ratios may be correctly 
referred to as propositions. See Section 13.6.1 for details.

In the forensic context, the convention that is followed is that:
n the hypothesis is an account of the evidence that would be true if the 
prosecution’s case is correct;
n the alternative hypothesis is an account of the evidence that would be true if 
the defence’s case is correct.
As discussed in Section 13.6.1, there are specific rules that govern the choice of 
the hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. One possibility that these rules allow 
is that the alternative hypothesis may simply be that the hypothesis referred to in 
the numerator (i.e. the upper part of the fraction) is not correct. In this case, the 
likelihood ratio is as given by Equation 13.29:
 
the probability of the evidence occurring given that  
 
a particular hypothesis is correct
LR = –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 
Eq 13.29
 
the probability of the evidence occurring given than the 
 
same hypothesis is not correct

in which P, E and | have the same meanings as in Equation 13.28 and H is the 
hypothesis under test. The bar in the symbol H–
 stands for ‘not’. Hence, H–
 means ‘the 
hypothesis, H, is not correct’ and is termed the ‘not hypothesis’.
 
In order to establish why the likelihood ratio is a useful concept, let us consider 
a hypothetical example:3 consider a case in which an adult is known to have been 
at a crime scene. In this case, in order to establish the guilt or innocence of the 
accused, it is important to ascertain whether this person was a man.
 
Before hearing any evidence, the jury (or magistrates) will know that, to a very 
good approximation, half of the population is male. Therefore, the probability of any 
one adult selected at random being a man is 0.5. On the basis of this information 
alone, the odds that the person at the scene was a man can be worked out as:
 
0.5 
0.5 
1
–––––––– = –––– = –  
Eq 13.31
 (1 – 0.5) 
0.5 
1
that is, 1 to 1.
 
Useful though this information is, it is not particularly discriminating. However, 
if an eyewitness were available who could testify that the person concerned was at 
least 6 feet (1.83 m) tall, then this might suggest that it is more likely that the 
individual at the scene was a man than a woman. This suggestion is based on the 
observation that the proportion of adult males who are at least 6 feet tall is greater 
than that of adult females. In an attempt to quantify the value of this evidence, an 
expert witness could be asked to inform the court of the percentage of the adults 
of each sex with a height of at least 6 feet. For argument’s sake, let us assume 
that 5 per cent of men and 0.5 per cent of women fall into this category. In other 
words, the probability that a man who was selected randomly from all of the men 
in the population would be at least 6 feet tall is 5 per cent, whereas the equivalent  
probability among women is 0.5 per cent. This information can be used by the 
expert witness to generate a likelihood ratio to help the court test the hypothesis 
that the person at the scene was a man, thus:
 
the probability of a person being ≥ 6 ft tall given that 
 
the person is a man
LR = –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 
 
the probability of the person being ≥ 6 ft tall given that 
 
the person is not a man
  
5
= ––– = 10 
Eq 13.32
  0.5
This, in turn, can be used by those hearing the case to modify the 1-to-1 odds that 
they had calculated previously, thus:
1 
 10
– × 10 = – –– 
Eq 13.33
1 
 1
that is, the odds are 10 to 1 in favour of the person at the scene being a man. This 
figure is much more discriminating than the earlier 1-to-1 odds.
3 This example is modelled on a hypothetical case described by Robertson and Vignaux (1995); 
see the Further reading section at the end of this chapter for full bibliographic details.

 
lIkelIhooD RAtIos AnD the BAyesIAn AppRoACh n 437
 
In the language of the Bayesian approach, the original 1-to-1 odds are an 
example of prior odds and the final 10-to-1 odds are an example of posterior odds. 
Both prior odds and posterior odds are mathematical statements of what is known 
about the hypothesis being tested (in this case, that the person at the scene was a 
man). However, the prior odds represent what is known before the new evidence is 
taken into account, whereas the posterior odds embody what is known after this 
new evidence, expressed as a likelihood ratio, has been incorporated. According to 
Bayes’ theorem:
prior odds × LR = posterior odds 
Eq 13.34
 
Note that the prior odds are written as odds in favour of the hypothesis, producing 
posterior odds that are also expressed as odds in favour of the hypothesis. Posterior 
odds are a mathematical statement of what is known about the hypothesis being 
tested after the implications of the new evidence have been taken into account.
 
It is important to realise that the expert witness provides the likelihood ratio 
and not the prior odds. It may be argued that this is all that an expert witness can 
and, indeed, should do. In order to assist the jury in their understanding of the 
significance of a given likelihood ratio, the forensic scientist may express it verbally 
in terms of strength of evidence, according to a scale such as that given in Table 
13.5. The prior odds are established either by the prior knowledge of those hearing 
the case or as a consequence of evidence presented during the trial. The expert 
witness will not necessarily have all of this information; nor is it his or her job to 
establish the guilt or innocence of the accused but to assist the court in arriving at 
the correct decision.
 
In the case in question, for example, evidence presented during the trial might 
have established that the person at the scene was a nurse. If it is assumed, for the 
sake of argument, that only 2 per cent of nurses are men, then this will, in effect, 
radically alter the prior odds. Instead of being 1 to 1, they would become:
 
 0.02 
0.02 
0.02 ÷ 0.02 
1
 
––––––––– = ––––– = –––––––––– = ––  
Eq 13.35
 
(1 – 0.02) 
0.98 
0.98 ÷ 0.02 
49
that is, 1 to 49 in favour of the hypothesis.
 
This would mean that the posterior odds would become:
   1 
  10 
 1
––– × 10 = – –– ≈  – 
Eq 13.36
 49 
  49 
 5
that is, odds of 5 to 1 against the person at the scene being a man.
 
If the expert witness had attempted to establish the posterior odds for the court, 
without knowing that the person was a nurse, then he or she would have given 
misleading testimony. The expert witness would have wrongly given the impression 
that it is more likely that the person at the scene was a man than it was that this 
person was a woman.
 
Arguably, the Bayesian approach is of particular value when considering transfer 
evidence (also referred to as trace evidence). This occurs in accordance with 
Locard’s exchange principle, which states that ‘every contact leaves a trace’. Thus, 
between any victim and perpetrator of a particular crime, or between any crime 
scene and individual present at that scene, a transfer of evidence is likely to occur

that could, potentially, link the two together. As demonstrated by the variety of 
topics dealt with in this book, the range of materials that may constitute transfer 
evidence is wide and includes fibres, glass fragments and paint, to name but a few. 
Section 3.7 of Chapter 3 describes a Bayesian approach to the interpretation and 
evaluation of such evidence. The Bayesian approach may also be applied to evidence 
based on marks and impressions.
 
As noted in Section 3.7 of Chapter 3, unfortunately, during evidence evaluation, 
the probability values that are needed in the calculation of likelihood ratios are 
rarely known with complete accuracy. For this reason, whenever this limitation 
exists, the Bayesian approach to such evaluation involves a degree of subjectivity. 
13.6.1   The choice of hypotheses and the hierarchy of 
propositions
Recall from Equation 13.28 that a likelihood ratio (LR) may be written thus:
 
P(E|H1)
LR = ––––––––– 
Eq 13.37
 
P(E|H2)
in which P stands for ‘the probability of’, E stands for ‘the evidence occurring’, 
| stands for ‘given’, H1 is the hypothesis under test and H2 is the alternative 
hypothesis.
 
In order for a likelihood ratio to be meaningful, H1 and H2 must be statements 
that are either true or false. Furthermore, they must be mutually exclusive; in other 
words, in order to create a meaningful likelihood ratio, it must be impossible for 
both of the propositions to be true. For example, if H1 is that the perpetrator of the 
crime is male, then an acceptable H2 would be that the perpetrator of the crime is 
not male. However, if H2 were that the perpetrator of the crime was an adult, then 
this would not be appropriate, as it is entirely possible to be both male and adult.
 
In the example in which H1 is that the perpetrator of the crime is male and H2 is 
that the perpetrator of the crime is not male, then H1 and H2 are not only mutually 
exclusive but also exhaustive. Two hypotheses are exhaustive when between them 
they account for all possibilities. In the example under consideration, H2 could be 
written as ‘H1 is not correct’. If H1 and H2 are mutually exclusive, then defining H2 
as being not H1 ensures that H1 and H2 are exhaustive. However, it is not necessary 
for the two hypotheses of a likelihood ratio to be exhaustive. Indeed, there are 
scenarios in which an accurate reflection of the probative value of the evidence can 
be achieved only if H1 and H2 are not exhaustive.
 
For example, take a case in which human blood is found at a murder scene of 
a type that, for argument’s sake, is found in 1 in every 200 people in the general 
population. Given this scenario, let us consider what the likelihood ratio would 
be associated with finding that the blood of the accused was of the same type as 
found at the crime scene. In doing this, it will be assumed that it is not possible 
for a person’s blood type to change and that the test for blood types is error-free. 
Furthermore, to avoid the complications caused by the inheritance of blood type, 
it will be assumed that the accused is known to have no living relatives. On this 
basis, if H1 is that the blood found at the scene was from the accused and H2 is that 

 
lIkelIhooD RAtIos AnD the BAyesIAn AppRoACh n 439
the blood found at the scene was not from the accused (i.e. H2 = not H1), then the 
likelihood ratio generated by this evidence is:
 
P(E|H1) 
1
LR = ––––––––– = ––––– = 200 
Eq 13.38
 
P(E|H2) 
(  1  )
 
 
––––
 
 
200
If you have difficulty in understanding why the denominator is 1/200, note that 
H2 could equally have been written as ‘that the blood found at the scene was from 
someone unknown and not the accused’. As this other person is taken at random 
from the general population, there is a 1 in 200 probability that his or her blood 
type will be the same as that of the accused. Note that in this example H1 and H2 
are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
 
Using the verbal scale given in Table 13.5, the likelihood ratio given by Equation 
13.38 is moderately strong evidence in support of the blood at the scene originating 
from the accused.
 
Let us now imagine that the murder was committed by stabbing the victim to 
death and that the victim’s blood type was the same as that of the accused. Now, 
the two most likely hypotheses are that the blood found at the scene was from the 
accused (H1) and that the blood found at the scene was from the victim (H2): 
P(E|H1) 
1
–––––––– = –– = 1 
Eq 13.39
P(E|H2) 
1
which, as shown in Table 13.5, has no probative value. Note that, as before, H1 and 
H2 are mutually exclusive. However, they are no longer exhaustive. Nonetheless, they 
more accurately portray the full situation than do the H1 and H2 of Equation 13.38.
 
It is useful to draw a distinction between explanations and propositions.4 An 
explanation is any statement that accounts for the existence of the evidence in 
the state in which it was discovered. For example, ‘The DNA profile obtained from 
the semen found on the knickers was identical to that from the suspect because  
the semen originated from the suspect.’ Let us refer to this as Explanation A. 
An alternative explanation would be ‘The DNA profile obtained from the semen 
found on the knickers was identical to that from the suspect because the semen  
originated from another man with an identical DNA profile to that of the suspect.’ 
This alternative will be denoted Explanation B. For each of these explanations, the 
probability of the evidence occurring given that the explanation is correct is 1. This 
means that a likelihood ratio constructed using these explanations would also be 
1. As shown in Table 13.5, this has no probative value. This is despite the fact that 
the DNA evidence does provide information about the origin of the semen, clearly 
implying that this evidence should have probative value. 
 
To reveal this probative value, it is necessary to use propositions, not merely 
explanations, as the hypotheses when constructing the likelihood ratio. In this 
context, propositions are statements that are designed in pairs by carefully 
taking into consideration the circumstances of the case. To illustrate this,

pp. 3–10.

 
 440 n stAtIstICs AnD the AnAlysIs, InteRpRetAtIon AnD evAlUAtIon of evIDenCe
consider Explanation A. If this were a statement of the prosecution’s contention, 
then a meaningful alternative could be created by rewording Explanation B 
to give ‘The DNA profile obtained from the semen found on the knickers was 
identical to that from the suspect because the semen originated from some other 
unknown man.’ Unlike Explanation B, the probability of the evidence occurring 
given that this alternative is correct is not 1. Instead, it equals the frequency in 
the relevant population of men of the DNA profile that was identified from the 
semen. For argument’s sake, assume that the profile in question has a frequency of  
2.0 × 10–14 (the method used to calculate DNA profile frequencies is described in 
Chapter 6). Note that, as before, the probability of the evidence occurring given 
that Explanation A is correct is 1. This means that the likelihood ratio constructed 
using Explanation A and the meaningful alternative would have a value of  
1/(2.0 × 10–14) = 5 × 1013, indicating correctly that this DNA evidence has very 
great probative value indeed. In replacing Explanation B with the meaningful 
alternative given above, a pair of propositions has been created. This has happened 
because the rewording of Explanation B has taken into account the circumstances 
of the case and the wording of Explanation A.
 
Arguably, for any given piece of evidence, the likelihood ratio that is most 
pertinent to the task of the court is the one in which H1 is that the accused is 
guilty of the crime in question and H2 is that the accused is not guilty of that same 
crime. However, in many instances, the forensic scientist does not have all of the 
information that is necessary in order to formulate this likelihood ratio.
 
Take, for example, a crime in which the perpetrator broke a window. Consider a 
situation in which the scientist has been provided with fragments of glass recovered 
from a suspect’s clothing (the questioned sample) and control pieces of glass taken 
from that which remains within the window frame at the crime scene. The scientist 
then measured the refractive indices of the questioned and control samples and 
found them to be indistinguishable. If the scientist had at his or her disposal a 
suitable database of the frequency distribution of the population of glass refractive 
indices, then he or she could evaluate the following likelihood ratio:
 
P(E|H1)
LR = ––––––––  
Eq 13.40
 
P(E|H2)
in which E is that the refractive indices of the questioned and control samples are 
indistinguishable, H1 is that the questioned sample originated from the broken 
window at the crime scene, and H2 is that the questioned sample did not originate 
from the broken window at the crime scene.
 
Notice that the H1 and H2 of Equation 13.40 are not worded in terms of any 
crime, or the guilt or innocence of the accused. This is because the scientist does 
not have the necessary information on which to assess a likelihood ratio based on 
such concepts. Instead H1 and H2 of Equation 13.40 are worded in terms of the 
source of the questioned sample. They are, therefore, examples of source-level 
propositions (also called level I propositions). Other examples of pairs of source- 
level propositions are given in Table 13.6. As can be seen from this table, two other 
levels of proposition are also recognised, namely the activity level (level II) and the 
offence level (level III, which is also referred to as the crime level).
 
As it is the task of the court to establish whether the accused is guilty, level III 
propositions are more pertinent to its deliberations than are level II propositions,

which, in turn, are of greater pertinence than level I propositions. It is for this 
reason that Table 13.6 represents a hierarchy of propositions.
 
With this in mind, returning to the example of the crime in which a window was 
broken, it is now clear that it would be more useful to the court if H1 and H2 of 
Equation 13.40 could be worded as level II propositions. Such propositions are 
termed activity-level propositions as they are worded in terms of actions. Ideally, in 
this case, as in others, these activity-level propositions would reflect the competing 
scenarios presented by the prosecution and the defence. H1 could be that the 
accused broke the window and H2 could be that the accused was not present when 
the window was broken. These are not the only possibilities, however. For example, 
the defence might concede that the accused was present when the window was 
broken but propose that he was not the person who broke the window. In this case, 
H1 might well remain as defined earlier in this paragraph, but H2 would become 
that the accused was present when the window was broken but did not break it. 
In order to assess such activity-level propositions, the scientist would require 
more information than was needed to calculate the likelihood ratio presented in 
Equation 13.40. For example, data on the transfer of glass fragments to clothing 
and persistence of these fragments on clothing would be required. Similarly, 
information on how the window was broken (e.g. was a stone thrown through it 
or was it kicked in?), and the time that had elapsed between the incident and the 
recovery of the fragments from the suspect’s clothing, would be needed. Also of 
value would be knowledge of the distribution of the glass fragments on the suspect’s 
clothing. Given the enhanced pertinence to the job of the court that level II 
propositions have over their level 1 counterparts, it can be argued that, wherever 
possible, the forensic scientist should base his or her assessment of the probative 
value of the evidence on activity-level propositions.
 
Level II propositions have a further advantage over level 1 propositions: that is, 
they can also be used to assess the probative value of the absence of evidence. To 
continue with the example of the case involving the broken window, not finding 
any fragments of glass on the clothing of the suspect may well be evidentially 
significant. However, source-level propositions cannot be used to assess this. In 
contrast, provided that there is enough background information available, the 
following likelihood ratio could be calculated: 
 
P(E|H1)
LR = ––––––––  
Eq 13.41
 
P(E|H2)
in which E is that no fragments of glass were recovered from the suspect’s clothing, 
H1 is that the suspect broke the window at the crime scene, and H2 is that the 
suspect had nothing to do with the breaking of the window. The types of information 
that would be needed to calculate this likelihood ratio would include transfer and 
persistence data, the alleged means by which the window was broken, and the 
alleged actions of the suspect between the time of the incident and that of the 
attempted collection of glass fragments from his or her clothing.
 
In order to assess the evidence using level III propositions, yet more information is 
required than is needed in the case of level II propositions. Importantly, this additional 
information includes knowledge that is not scientific in nature, such as the legal 
definitions of crimes. Arguably, such knowledge is outside the forensic scientist’s field 

 
LikeLihood ratios and the Bayesian approach n 443
of expertise and is, therefore, the domain of the court. If this argument is accepted, 
then a forensic scientist can properly assess few, if any, level III propositions.
 
Finally, it is noteworthy that in Table 13.6, none of the alternative hypotheses 
(i.e. the propositions labelled H2) given as examples is written as a not hypothesis.5 
This is for a good reason. To understand this, let us consider the process that the 
scientist would go through in order to calculate the likelihood ratio that is given 
by Equation 13.40. On the basis that the refractive indices of the questioned and 
control samples would be indistinguishable if they originated from the same piece 
of glass, P(E|H1) = 1. To establish the value of the denominator of Equation 13.40, 
the scientist would examine the database to find out the frequency with which 
glass of the refractive index of interest is found in the population. This frequency 
would equal P(E|H2). Notice that to find the value for P(E|H2), the scientist in fact 
equated H2 with ‘the questioned sample originated from a broken glass item other 
than the broken window at the crime scene’. Although this is equivalent to the 
statement of H2 given in the paragraph containing Equation 13.40, it is arguably 
more useful as it informs the reader how an assessment of P(E|H2) would be arrived 
at. For this reason, a case can be made that it is good practice to avoid wording the 
alternative hypothesis as simply the not hypothesis, but instead to phrase it in a way 
that reflects the process that was used to evaluate P(E|H2).
13.6.2  The Case Assessment and Interpretation model
In the 1990s, the Forensic Science Service (FSS) (Section 1.3.2, Chapter 1) embarked 
on the development of a Case Assessment and Interpretation (CAI) model.6 This 
initiative was, in part, borne of a philosophy of continuous improvement within the 
FSS but it was also a response to a significant shift in the way forensic science services 
were funded. This shift reinforced the need for the FSS to provide services that were 
not only fit for purpose but also value for money.
 
At the time when the CAI model was first being formed, the use of Bayesian 
methods in forensic science was a relatively newly emerging discipline. Importantly, 
the CAI model was informed by these developments. Central to the CAI model is 
the idea that scientists should think deeply about the evaluation of the likely results 
of analyses that they may perform and that they should do this before they embark 
on such analyses. Furthermore, they should work with the person and organisation 
that is commissioning their services (i.e. the customer) to ensure that the work 
that is planned will meet the customer’s needs, offer value for money and serve the 
purposes of the justice system. 
 
As shown in Figure 13.9, the CAI model recognises three overlapping phases in 
forensic science casework, namely customer requirement, case pre-assessment and 
service delivery. These are described overleaf.
5 If the reader is unsure what is meant by the phrase ‘not hypothesis’, see Equation 13.30 for an 
explanation.

Customer requirement
In this, the needs of the customer are established and the scientist will seek to 
obtain information about the case, including details of any claims that are made by 
the suspect(s) that relate to the evidence in question. This will enable him or her 
to generate a meaningful pair of propositions (Section 13.6.1) that are to be tested 
against each other and evaluate where they are situated in the hierarchy of propositions 
(Table 13.6). In this section of this book, the proposition that the prosecution wishes 
to establish will be symbolised as H1, while that of the defence will be H2.
Case pre-assessment
This phase is at the heart of the CAI model. At this stage, the scientist establishes 
what he or she might expect to result from the analyses that are proposed. Clearly, 
this expectation is likely to differ depending on which of the two propositions is true 
and the scientist needs to explicitly consider both of these possibilities. It is likely 
that this process will result in a series of alternative outcomes, the probabilities of 
which will vary depending on which proposition is true. If it is possible to do so, the 
CAI model recommends that numerical estimates are given to these probabilities.
 
In the example that is provided below, there are two alternative outcomes that 
are envisaged. These are the recovery of either none or some (i.e. >0) fragments of 
glass from clothing of a suspect that are indistinguishable from a control sample of 
glass. In their seminal paper on the CAI model, Cook et al. (see footnote 6) provide 
an example based on glass evidence that extends this series of outcomes to three 
alternatives, namely none, few (1, 2 or 3) or many (>3) fragments of glass found

on a garment taken from a suspect that match a control sample. In a later paper,7 
the same authors describe an instance in which the reciprocal exchange of fibres 
between the garments of two people may be anticipated and use this to illustrate 
how pre-assessment can be conducted in cases that involve the potential for two-way 
transfer of trace evidence.
 
To see why the numerical approach to case pre-assessment is of value, the theory 
that is described in Section 3.7 (Chapter 3) will be used here.
 
As in Section 3.7, consider a fictitious incident in which a bottle has been broken 
over the head of a victim, after which pieces of glass from the bottle were recovered 
and, shortly after the incident, clothing was seized from a suspect. However, here 
we are not assuming at the outset that this clothing has been searched for the 
presence of glass fragments. Instead, we are at the stage at which the customer has 
asked the scientist to search the garment for any fragments of glass and, if any are 
found, to compare their characteristics with those of glass from the bottle.
 
If what is known about the case is sufficient, it might be possible to construct 
activity-level propositions (Section 13.6.1). For example, these might be that H1 
is the suspect broke the bottle used in the incident and H2 is that the suspect had 
nothing to do with that event.
 
On examining the garment, the scientist would expect to find either:
n no fragments of glass that are indistinguishable from that of the bottle 
(symbolised here as E1); or 
n a group of one or more such fragments (E2). Later, when developing the 
argument that is presented below, it will be assumed that if such a group 
were to be found, all of its fragments would have a single source.
The probabilities of E1 and E2 occurring will vary according to which of H1 and H2 is 
correct. It will be less likely that no fragments that are indistinguishable from the 
bottle will be found on the suspect’s clothing (E1) if he broke the bottle (H1) than if 
he was not involved in the incident (H2). Conversely, it is more likely that there will 
be one or more such fragments (E2) if H1 were true than if H2 is correct. 
Estimating the probability of finding E 1 on the one hand and E 2 on 
the other if H1 is correct. Let us first establish the circumstances that could 
lead to E2, under the condition that H1 is correct. If it is assumed that all of the 
fragments that would make up E2 would have a single source, there are two such 
circumstances. These are that a group of glass fragments that are indistinguishable 
from that of the bottle was transferred to the suspect’s garments from either:
1. the bottle when it was broken; and/or 
2. somewhere else (what may be referred to as ‘innocent’ contamination); and,
3. in either case, this glass was subsequently recovered from the clothing.

The probability of the first of these occurring is a0t βb, while the probability of the 
second is at0 β, in which:
 
a0 is the probability that, before the incident, the suspect’s clothing was free 
of glass that is indistinguishable from that of the bottle;
 
t is the probability of glass being transferred to the assailant’s clothing when 
he broke the bottle on the victim’s head and of this transferred glass being 
subsequently found and recovered;
 
βb is the probability of the characteristics of the glass from the bottle being 
indistinguishable from those of any glass that was transferred from that 
bottle to the suspect’s clothing and then subsequently found and recovered;
 
a is the probability that, by chance alone, there would be glass on the 
suspect’s clothing that would be recovered in the laboratory;
 
t0 is the probability of no glass being transferred to the assailant’s clothing 
when he broke the bottle on the victim’s head;
 
β is the probability of the characteristics of the glass from the bottle being 
indistinguishable from those of one or more particles of glass from the 
suspect’s clothing given that this glass did not originate from the bottle.
Therefore:
P(E2|H1) = a0t βb + at0 β 
Eq 13.42
As E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive (i.e. the analysis could produce either outcome 
but not both) and exhaustive (i.e. together they account for all possible outcomes):
P(E2|H1) + P(E1H1) = 1 
Eq 13.43
Therefore:
P(E1|H1) = 1 – P(E2|H1) = 1 – (a0t βb + at0 β) 
Eq 13.44
Estimates of each of P(E1|H1) and P(E2|H1) may now be calculated. This is possible 
as, given enough information, estimates can be made for the values of each of the 
variables in Equations 13.42 and 13.44, thus:
a0 equals the proportion of the general public that have no glass on their 
clothing that is indistinguishable from that of the bottle, assuming that the 
suspect is a random member of the general population. If it is also assumed 
that the bottle is made from typical bottle glass, a0 can be estimated from 
data from surveys of glass recovered from the clothing of the general public.
 t may be estimated from:
n data found from experiments in which glass bottles were broken and the 
number of glass fragments that were transferred to the clothing of the 
person who broke each bottle was established;

 
lIkelIhooD RAtIos AnD the BAyesIAn AppRoACh n 447
n knowledge of the retentive properties of the fabric from which the 
suspect’s clothes are made;
n knowledge of what occurred to the suspect’s clothing between the time 
of the incident and its arrival in the scientist’s possession.
 
βb will equal 1 if it is assumed that any glass that was transferred to the 
assailant’s clothing on breaking the bottle will be indistinguishable from the 
glass recovered from the bottle after the event.
 
a equals the proportion of the general public that have recoverable glass 
on their clothing at any given time, assuming that the suspect is a random 
member of the general population.
 
t0 can be estimated from experiments in which bottles have been broken and 
the transfer of glass to the clothing of the person breaking each bottle was 
monitored.
 
β can be estimated from data from surveys of glass recovered from clothing 
from the general public, on the assumption that the bottle is made of typical 
bottle glass. This assumes that the suspect is a random member of the 
general population.
Estimating the probability of finding E1 on the one hand and E2 on the 
other if H 2 is correct  Given this proviso that H2 is correct, the only way that 
could lead to E2 is that the group of glass fragments was present on the suspect’s 
clothing by ‘innocent’ contamination and this was then recovered in the laboratory. 
The probability of this occurring may be estimated as, using the symbols as defined 
earlier in this section, it will be aβ. That is:
P(E2|H2) = aβ 
 
Eq 13.45
As noted previously, E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, therefore:
P(E2|H2) + P(E1|H2) = 1 
Eq 13.46
and:
P(E1|H2) = 1 – P(E2|H2) = 1 – aβ 
Eq 13.47
This enables P(E1|H2) to be estimated.
Estimating the likelihood ratios  For the sake of argument, let us assume that, 
based on the arguments described above and knowledge of the case, the scientist is 
able to estimate that:
P(E1|H1) = 0.04  
Eq 13.48
P(E2|H1) = 0.96   
Eq 13.49
P(E1|H2) = 0.98   
Eq 13.50
P(E2|H2) = 0.02   
Eq 13.51

 
 448 n stAtIstICs AnD the AnAlysIs, InteRpRetAtIon AnD evAlUAtIon of evIDenCe
The scientist is therefore able to predict that the outcome of the analysis will result 
in one of two likelihood ratios, which may be assigned estimated values. These are:
P(E1|H1)     0.04
–––––––– = ––––– ≈ 0.041 
Eq 13.52
P(E1|H2)     0.98
P(E2|H1)     0.96
–––––––– = ––––– ≈ 48 
Eq 13.53
P(E2|H2)     0.02
Using the verbal scale that is provided in Table 13.5, the scientist could report to 
the customer that the outcome of the analysis is likely to produce either:
(a) moderate support for H2; or 
(b) moderate support for H1.
Furthermore, from the data in Equations 13.48 and 13.49, if H1 is true, the 
probability of (a) occurring is 0.04 (i.e. 4 per cent) and that of (b) is 0.96 (i.e. 
96 per cent). Similarly, from the data in Equations 13.50 and 13.51, if H2 is true, 
the probability of (a) occurring is 0.98 (i.e. 98 per cent) and the probability of (b) 
occurring is 0.02 (i.e. 2 per cent).
 
Armed with this information, the customer can decide whether the prospect 
of obtaining evidence that moderately supports one proposition or the other is of 
sufficient value to justify the cost of the work being completed.
Further matters for consideration  Thus far, it has been assumed that the 
bottle is made of typical bottle glass. This, of course, may or may not be true. This 
factor does have importance because, as illustrated in the next paragraph, even 
if it has negligible implications for the estimates of the values of P(E1|H1) and 
P(E2|H1), it has a significant bearing on those of P(E1|H2) and P(E2|H2). This has 
the disadvantage of limiting the precision of the estimates given in Equations 13.50 
and 13.51 and thereby decreases the precision of the estimates of the likelihood 
ratios given in Equations 13.52 and 13.53. However, it does mean that at this point, 
the scientist could also offer a staged approach to the analysis, starting with the 
relatively inexpensive determination of the refractive index of the glass that has 
been retrieved from the broken bottle.
 
Let us assume that the customer asks for this initial work to be done and it 
reveals that the bottle glass has a refractive index that is rarely encountered. This 
will have the effect of decreasing the estimated value of β that appears in Equations 
13.42, 13.44, 13.45 and 13.47. Hence, this would decrease the estimates of 
P(E2|H1) (Equation 13.42) and P(E2|H2) (Equation 13.45), while increasing the 
estimates of P(E1|H1) (Equation 13.44) and P(E1|H2) (Equation 13.47).
 
If there is nothing in the suspect’s background that means that he is more likely 
to have glass fragments on his clothing than is any other member of the general 
public, the probability of what is referred to previously as ‘innocent’ contamination 
is low. This will have been true even before the refractive index of the bottle glass 
is known to be one that occurs rarely. It is known that the suspect’s clothing was 
seized shortly after the incident. Therefore, it is likely that, compared with the term 

 
lIkelIhooD RAtIos AnD the BAyesIAn AppRoACh n 449
a0tβb, the term at0 β in both Equations 13.42 and 13.44 is very small. This means 
that decreasing the size of β can be expected to have negligible impact on the 
estimated values of either P(E2|H1) or P(E1|H1).
 
However, from Equations 13.45 and 13.47, it can be seen that a significant drop 
in the value of β will have a significant impact on the estimates for the values of 
P(E2|H2) and P(E1|H2).
 
With the above in mind, assume that this refractive index information allowed 
the scientist to generate the following revised estimates:
P(E1|H2) = 0.999  
Eq 13.54
P(E2|H2) = 0.001  
Eq 13.55
Based on these data, and unchanged estimates for P(E1|H1) and P(E2|H1), the 
scientist could now reappraise the estimated values of the two likelihood ratios 
given in Equations 13.52 and 13.53, thus:
P(E1|H1)       0.04
–––––––– = –––––– ≈ 0.040 (i.e. moderate support for H2) 
Eq 13.56
P(E1|H2)      0.999
P(E2|H1)       0.96
–––––––– = –––––– ≈ 960 (i.e. moderate support for H1) 
Eq 13.57
P(E2|H2)     0.001
and advise the customer that:
n if the suspect broke the bottle (i.e. H1 is true) there is a probability of:
– 0.04 (i.e. 4 per cent) of there being moderate support for H2 (see 
Equations 13.48 and 13.56);
– 0.96 (i.e. 96 per cent) of there being moderately strong support for H1 
(see Equations 13.49 and 13.57);
n if the suspect had nothing to do with the breaking of the bottle (i.e. H2 is 
true) there is a probability of:
– 0.999 (i.e. 99.9 per cent) of there being moderate support for H2 (see 
Equations 13.54 and 13.56);
– 0.001 (i.e. 0.1 per cent) of there being moderately strong support for H1 
(see Equations 13.55 and 13.57).
Establishing the fact that the bottle glass has a rare refractive index has considerably 
enhanced the potential value of continuing with this work and the customer may 
decide that it represents sufficient value for money to proceed.
Service delivery
If the scientist is asked to undertake the remainder of the work, this would require 
the conclusion of the service delivery phase of the CAI model. During this, the 
analysis of the items received is completed, the results are interpreted and evaluated 
by means of calculating a likelihood ratio, and the statement is written.

Concluding remarks
It should be emphasised that, as illustrated in Figure 13.9, the entirety of the  
CAI model utilises an iterative approach, with any new relevant information that 
comes to light being used to hone the propositions and/or the probabilities used in 
the likelihood ratio.
 
It can be argued that the CAI model has a number of positive attributes:
n When used, it requires the scientist to think deeply about the outcomes that 
may be expected from any given analysis before that work is carried out and 
to do so in an overtly balanced fashion. This has the advantage that it can 
be used to refute any suggestion that the scientist may be rationalising the 
results by creating an explanation to fit them.
n It requires high-quality communication between the customer and the 
scientist, thereby helping to ensure that the needs of the criminal justice 
system are met.
n It provides customers with case-specific information that they can use to 
make value-for-money decisions.
Finally, it should be noted that the CAI model is a developing model that is likely to 
become more refined with time.
13.6.3   The prosecutor’s fallacy and the defence 
attorney’s fallacy
One of the advantages of being conversant with the Bayesian approach is that  
it heightens the scientist’s awareness of certain common but serious errors  
of thought. 
 
Take, for example, the interpretation of data provided by a chemical test for the 
presence of a particular controlled substance, for example heroin. For argument’s 
sake, imagine that exhaustive studies have shown that this test gives a positive 
result in 99 per cent of cases in which it is applied to samples that contain this 
controlled substance. Consider a case in which a forensic scientist has performed 
this test and is presenting her findings in court. The barrister asks: ‘To avoid any 
confusion, please will you confirm that this evidence means that there is a 99 per 
cent probability that the substance is, or at least contains, heroin?’
 
At first glance, it might appear that the answer to this should be ‘Yes, I can 
confirm that.’ However, this would be wrong. To explore this further, it is useful to 
introduce the following:
P(A|B) = C% 
 
Eq 13.58
This stands for the probability (P) of a specific assertion (A) being true given 
that (|) another specific assertion (B) is also true is C%. In this instance, A is the 
positive test result and B is that the substance is, or at least contains, heroin. The 
exhaustive studies referred to above concluded that: 
Iteration
In the sense in 
which it is used 
here, iteration is the 
refinement of ideas 
by the repeating of 
the thought process 
that led to them, 
with each repeat 
being armed with 
new information.

 
lIkelIhooD RAtIos AnD the BAyesIAn AppRoACh n 451
P(A|B) = 99% 
 
Eq 13.59
The statement represented by Equation 13.59 is called a conditional. At this stage it 
is important to realise that:
P(A|B) ≠ P(B|A)  
Eq 13.60
To claim otherwise is to transpose the conditional and is a serious error.8 In the 
example cited earlier, that concerned the barrister’s question, the statement that 
the witness is being invited to confirm is a transposition of the conditional and is 
therefore wrong. As in this case, transposing the conditional within the forensic 
context normally artificially bolsters the prosecution’s case. For this reason, this 
error is also referred to as the prosecutor’s fallacy.
 
As introduced earlier in this chapter, the likelihood ratio (LR) defined by 
Equation 13.27 can be written using symbolism of the type given in Equation 13.58, 
by substituting the A and B of Equation 13.58 with more specific symbols, thus:
 
P(E|H1)
LR = ––––––––  
Eq 13.28
 
P(E|H2)
in which P stands for ‘the probability of’, E stands for ‘the evidence occurring’, | stands 
for ‘given’, H1 is the hypothesis under test and H2 is the alternative hypothesis.
 
From Equation 13.28, it is clear that each likelihood ratio presents two 
opportunities to transpose the conditional, as this could occur in either the 
numerator (i.e. the upper part of the fraction) or the denominator. In forensic 
applications, likelihood ratios are normally written such that H1 is the hypothesis 
that is being put forward by the prosecution and H2 is the hypothesis propounded 
by the defence. With this in mind, the example concerning the chemical test for 
controlled substances is an example of the potential for this error to occur in the 
numerator. Let us now consider an example of such a mistake in the denominator.
 
Consider a case in which a bloodstain was left at the scene and that this had 
a blood type that was the same as the defendant’s, and that this is found in 1 in 
200 people in the general population. Let H1 be that the bloodstain came from the 
defendant and H2 be that it came from some other unknown person (i.e. anyone 
except the defendant). Assuming that a person could not change his or her blood 
type and that the test for the blood type is free of errors, P(E|H1) of Equation 13.28 
would equal 1 (i.e. 100 per cent) in this case, and P(E|H2) would be given by:
 
 
1
 
P(E|H2) = ––––– = 5 × 10–3 
Eq 13.61
 
 
200 
So the overall likelihood ratio would be:
 
P(E|H1) 
1
 
–––––––– = ––––––– = 200  
  
Eq 13.62
 
P(E|H2) 
5 × 10–3
which is moderately strong evidence in support of the prosecution’s case (Table 13.5).
8 To see that transposing the conditional is a mistake, let us consider an obvious example. Let A 
be that the animal is a bird and B be that the animal is a robin. Then, as the only animals that 
are robins are birds, P(A|B) = 100%. However, not all birds are robins and so P(B|A) ≠ 100%.
Transpose the  
conditional
To equate P(A|B) 
with P(B|A), which 
is an error of 
thought. This error 
is also known as the 
prosecutor’s fallacy.

 
 452 n stAtIstICs AnD the AnAlysIs, InteRpRetAtIon AnD evAlUAtIon of evIDenCe
 
In terms of odds (see Box 13.1), the denominator in Equation 13.62 would be:
 
        5 × 10–3          5 × 10–3       1
 
≈ ––––––––––––– ≈ –––––––– = –––– 
Eq 13.63
 
    (1 – 5 × 10–3)        1 
        200
That is, 200 to 1 against the bloodstain having the same blood type as the defendant 
if the bloodstain had been left by anyone other than the defendant. Transposing this 
conditional would lead to the erroneous conclusion that the odds of the bloodstain 
having been left by anyone other than the defendant are 200 to 1 against. To see 
that this is wrong, note that there are many millions of people in the world with the 
same blood-type as the defendant. If any one of these were chosen at random, and as 
blood-type evidence is the only evidence under consideration, the odds of this person 
leaving the stain would be exactly the same as that of the defendant.
 
Another error of logic that is commonly made is what is known as the defence 
attorney’s fallacy. The error committed during this fallacy is to assume that 
because a feature that links a defendant to a crime could equally well link many 
other people to that crime, the evidence provided by this feature is worthless. To 
see why this is an erroneous argument, note that a likelihood ratio is an expression 
of the probative value of the evidence that generated it. Evidence that tells strongly 
either for the prosecution or the defence is said to have high probative value. 
Such items of evidence will have either large likelihood ratios (if they tell for the 
prosecution’s case) or small likelihood ratios (if they tell for the defence’s case). 
Evidence with no probative value will have a likelihood ratio of 1. Note also that 
likelihood ratios associated with different pieces of independent evidence9 can 
simply be multiplied together to generate a likelihood ratio that represents the 
overall probative value of these pieces of evidence. This means that several pieces 
of evidence, each of which tells for the prosecution’s case but with low individual 
probative values, may combine to produce a high probative value overall. Evidence 
that links a defendant to a crime but that could equally well link many other people 
to that crime has low probative value but is not worthless.
13.6.4  The use of the Bayesian approach in jury trials
In a number of important rulings concerning cases that involved DNA evidence, the 
Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) has criticised the explicit explanation to jurors 
in court of the Bayesian approach as a means by which they can combine all of 
the evidence that they hear in a particular case. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal 
has recommended that experts presenting DNA evidence do not report a likelihood 
ratio but instead provide a random occurrence ratio. This is what is commonly 
termed the match probability (Chapter 6, Section 6.4.2) and is the probability of 
a person chosen at random from the population of interest having the same DNA 
profile as that of the defendant. Provided that the expert has sufficient knowledge 
to be able to do so, the Court of Appeal has suggested that the DNA expert might 
also properly tell the jury how many individuals in a given group of people would

It is an error of 
thought to assume 
that because a 
feature that links 
a defendant to a 
crime could equally 
well link many 
other people to that 
crime, the evidence 
provided by this 
feature is worthless. 
9 Two pieces of evidence are independent if knowing about the existence of one of these would not 
alter the likelihood ratio associated with the other. Likelihood ratios associated with pieces of 
evidence that are not independent can be combined but not by simple multiplication. Details of 
this are available in the Further reading section at the end of this chapter.

 
lIkelIhooD RAtIos AnD the BAyesIAn AppRoACh n 453
have the profile in question. With this in mind, for example, the expert might tell 
the jury how many people in the population of the UK could be expected to have the 
same DNA profile as the defendant. However, to be in keeping with the findings of 
the Court of Appeal, the expert’s evidence should stop short of explanations of the 
use of the Bayesian method for combining evidence. 
 
The Court of Appeal has also provided guidelines to judges for their use when 
summing up the importance of DNA evidence, providing the following by way of an 
exemplar:
Members of the jury, if you accept the scientific evidence called by the Crown 
this indicates that there are probably only four or five white males in the United 
Kingdom from whom that semen stain could have come. The defendant is one of 
them. If that is the position, the decision you have to reach, on all the evidence, 
is whether you are sure that it was the defendant who left that stain or whether 
it is possible that it was one of that other small group of men who share the 
same DNA characteristics.10 
Clearly, this makes no use of Bayes’ theorem. 
 
The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) handed down a ruling dated 26 October 
2010 in a case known as R. v. T.11. This ruling quashed the murder conviction of the 
appellant and the case was sent for re-trial. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
this case centred on the footwear evidence that had been given at the original trial. 
The footwear expert in this case had calculated a likelihood ratio to assist him in 
evaluating the evidence that was revealed by a comparison of footwear marks found 
at the scene of the crime and the pattern on the sole, the size, the amount of wear 
and any damage features as observed on the suspect footwear. In doing this, he had 
made use of databases that provided information on the frequency of occurrence 
of footwear features. However, he did not reveal these calculations in his report to 
the court where the conviction occurred. The Court of Appeal criticised this lack 
of transparency and what it considered to be the unreliability of the databases that 
were used in this case and which are available in footwear cases in general.
 
On 15 November 2010, the Crown Prosecution Service produced guidance in 
response to this ruling, which states:
‘. . . The ruling only applies to evidence based on the Footmark Database. The 
principles should not, at this stage, be applied to other database analysis.
Footmark comparison evidence is still admissible and experts can still give sub-
jective, evaluative opinion based on their examinations.
For current cases involving footmark comparison evidence, where experts are 
using the Bayesian statistical approach to support their findings, they should 
be asked to provide a further statement clarifying any statistical basis they have 
used. Where forensic science providers are using this approach, they should pro-
vide a summary of their data and interpretive methods.
Past convictions are safe unless and until set aside by an appellate court. . . .’

The Bayesian approach provides a logical framework for evidence evaluation. 
Therefore, a very strong case can be made for its usefulness to a forensic scientist 
when he or she is assessing the probative value of a given piece(s) of evidence 
that has or have been analysed by methods that are within the scientist’s field 
of expertise. However, as has been made clear by the Court of Appeal, at least in 
England and Wales, there are serious misgivings about its use as a tool by which 
juries can combine the various items of evidence that are presented to them in a 
given case.
 
Furthermore, at the time of writing (March 2011), the R. v. T. appeal court 
ruling is still relatively recent. Time will tell how significant and wide-ranging its 
implications will be for the admissibility in court of expert evidence that is informed 
by likelihood ratio calculations.
Problems
Note that outline answers to these problems are provided on the book’s  
accompanying website.

n Data are facts and figures that convey information. 
forensic scientists gather data that provide evidence 
either for or against the prosecution’s case. In order to 
be able to present the evidence in court, the data on 
which evidence is based must be analysed, interpreted 
and evaluated. In this context, analysis can be thought 
of as the characterisation of the item under considera-
tion. this might involve, for example, the establishment 
of the concentration of one of the components of a mix-
ture. Interpretation is the step in which the data from the 
analysis phase are used to establish the nature of the item 
being examined. finally, evaluation is the process of plac-
ing into the context of the case the data that have been 
obtained from the other two steps. 
n statistical tools have been developed that are of value 
in each of these three aspects of the forensic scientist’s 
work. for example, analysis frequently requires calibration 
graphs to be constructed, and regression analysis allows 
the line of best fit to be established for such graphs. 
Interpretation can be aided by, for example, t-tests. for 
instance, these can be used to test whether two groups 
of fragments of glass, one from the crime scene and one 
from the clothing of a suspect, are significantly different 
from each other. the evaluation of evidence is arguably 
well served by the Bayesian approach, as this allows the 
probative value of the evidence under consideration to 
be calculated. furthermore, the Bayesian approach has 
a central role in the Case Assessment and Interpretation 
model which allows value-for-money decisions to be made 
by those purchasing forensic science services. the Court 
of Appeal (Criminal Division) has indicated that it is not 
appropriate for jurors to be instructed in the use of the 
Bayesian approach as a means for combining different ele-
ments of evidence. expert witnesses are expected to reveal 
the means by which they arrive at their opinions and, in a 
ruling concerning footwear evidence, the Court of Appeal 
(Criminal Division) has made it clear that the data used in 
the statistical evaluation of such evidence must be reliable.

2. Two analysts, one with considerably more experience than the other, calibrated 
the same automatic volumetric pipette. This was done by repeatedly using the 
pipette to deliver samples of water. The temperature of the water was known 
and the weight of each sample was determined to four decimal places of a gram. 
Literature values were then used to find the density of water at the measured 
temperature in g ml–1 to five decimal places. From this, the volume of water 
delivered in each sample was calculated. The data generated are given below:

(a) Comment on the data given above as far as you are able. Note that the 
volume that the pipette was designed to deliver was 200 µl (i.e. 0.200 ml). 
(b) If, after answering part (a) of this question, you were informed that while 
the experienced analyst changed the disposable tip of the pipette between 
samples, the inexperienced analyst used the same pipette tip throughout, 
how would this change your answer to part (a) of this question?
3. A forensic scientist determined the refractive indices of each of four 
fragments of glass obtained from the crime scene and each of four fragments 
of glass obtained from the suspect’s clothing. This resulted in the data shown 
in the table below.

The defence team asked to be supplied with a fragment of glass from the 
crime scene and a fragment of glass taken from the suspect’s clothing. These 
were subsequently analysed in an independent laboratory. Using the same 
methods as used by the forensic scientist, an analyst at this independent 
laboratory determined the refractive index of the two fragments of glass four 
times each. The data generated are shown in the table below:

(a) On the basis of the data given in the first table, the forensic scientist 
stated that this did not provide sufficient evidence to show at a 95 per 
cent level of confidence that the two samples of glass came from different 
sources. Is this correct? 
(b) The analyst working for the independent laboratory concluded on the 
basis of the data given in the second table that there was sufficient 
evidence to show with a confidence level of more than 95 per cent that 
the two fragments of glass came from different sources. Is this correct? 
(c) Which do you believe is more reliable: the work of the forensic scientist 
or that of the independent laboratory? Justify your answer.
4. To establish the refractive index of a piece of colourless glass, it is immersed 
in an oil with a refractive index that is slightly higher than that of the 
glass and it is observed in monochromatic light. The oil and the glass are 
then heated, causing the refractive index of the oil to fall. At a particular 
temperature (called the match temperature), the glass will become invisible 
because, at that temperature, the refractive index of the oil equals that of 
the glass. If the temperature dependence of the refractive index of the oil 
is known, its refractive index, and hence that of the glass, at the match 
temperature can be worked out. To establish the temperature dependence 
of the refractive index of an oil, its refractive index is measured with a 
refractometer at a range of different temperatures. This exercise was carried 
out with an oil, known here as oil Z, and the data generated are given in the 
table below.

(a) A calibration graph could be drawn from the data presented in the table, 
with temperature (in °C) on the x-axis and refractive index on the y-axis. 
Use linear regression to find the equation for the straight line of best fit 
for this graph (you are not expected to draw the graph). 
(b) Comment on whether the table contains sufficient data to construct a 
reliable calibration graph.
(c) Using a different oil from oil Z, the refractive index of a fragment of glass 
was measured three times. The figures obtained were 1.5464, 1.5460 
and 1.5465, with a mean of 1.5463. What is the 95 per cent confidence 
interval associated with the mean of these data?
5. For the purposes of this question, assume that:
n there are only two types of glass, namely glass that is lead crystal and glass 
that is not lead crystal;
n all lead crystal glass has a refractive index greater than 1.5210;
n measurement of many thousands of randomly selected glasses that are not 
lead crystal reveals their refractive indices to be normally distributed with 
a mean of 1.5180 and with a standard deviation of 0.001 53;

 
lIkelIhooD RAtIos AnD the BAyesIAn AppRoACh n 457
n the glass recovered from the crime scene had a refractive index of more 
than 1.5210;
n on average, one in five pieces of glass is lead crystal.
(a) What are the odds in favour of the crime scene glass being lead crystal 
before the refractive index data are taken into account?
(b) How do the refractive index data alter these odds?
(c) Assume for the purposes of this question that although many types of 
lead crystal have densities in excess of 3.0 g cm–3, no glass that is not 
lead crystal has this property. How would the observation that the glass 
obtained from the crime scene had a density greater than 3.0 g cm–3 alter 
the odds that you calculated in part (b)? 
6. This question concerns a fictitious crime in which a window was broken and 
for which a suspect has been arrested.
(a) If there are 10 000 people who could have broken the window, what are 
the prior odds in favour of the suspect being the person who did so?
(b) Inspection of the suspect’s coat revealed a number of minute pieces of 
glass on it. It is estimated that the probability of this occurring is 0.8 if 
the suspect had indeed broken the window. The prosecution argues that 
this means that the odds in favour of the suspect breaking the window 
based on this evidence are 4 to 1. It has been shown that at any one time 
there are many people who have a number of minute pieces of glass on 
their coats. On this basis, the defence team argue that this evidence is of 
no relevance to the case. Which, if either, of these arguments is correct? 
To help you answer the question, assume that at any one time 4 per cent 
of the population have a number of minute pieces of glass on their coats.
(c) New evidence from a security camera then became available, which 
irrefutably showed that the suspect and one other man were the only 
people who could have broken the window. Ignoring the information 
presented in part (b) of this question, this security camera evidence was 
used to create new odds in place of those odds mentioned in part (a) of 
this question. What are these new odds in favour of the suspect being the 
person who broke the window?
(d) Faced with this new security camera evidence, the suspect admitted 
that he was present when the window was broken and that he had been 
wearing the coat referred to above at that time. Assume, as before, that 
the probability of the glass evidence being found on the coat if the wearer 
of the coat had broken the window is 0.8. Crime scene reconstruction 
experiments showed that the probability of this same evidence being 
found was 0.2 if the wearer of the coat had not broken the window 
but had stood nearby when this event occurred. What is the likelihood 
ratio associated with this evidence? Comment on any assumptions that 
you make.
(e) The prosecution now argues that this new evidence (i.e. that presented 
in parts (c) and (d) of this question) proves that the odds in favour of the 
suspect having broken the window are indeed 4 to 1. Is this correct?

7. Before attempting this question, it may be useful to read Section 3.7 of 
Chapter 3.
Consider a case in which a car was in collision with an adult pedestrian, 
killing that person. The car did not stop and was driven away from the 
scene of the crash. However, a short time later, the police recovered 
a car that they suspect of being the one that collided with the victim. 
Subsequent examination of the bonnet of the car revealed fibres that 
were indistinguishable from control fibres taken from the fabric of the 
coat that the deceased was wearing when involved in the fatal collision.
Devise a likelihood ratio for this fibres evidence based on activity-level 
propositions and establish an estimate of its value. Find the strength of 
this evidence on the verbal scale that is provided in Table 13.5.
For the purposes of tackling this problem, assume:
n at any one time, approximately 0.01 per cent of the bonnets of cars 
have fibres on them that would be indistinguishable from the above-
mentioned control fibres;
n if the suspect car had been the one involved in the collision, the 
probability of fibres being transferred from the victim’s coat to the 
car’s bonnet and then subsequently being found is approximately 
0.95.

Introduction
In Chapters 3–13, the forensic examination of the different types of evidence that may 
be recovered from crime scenes has been described in detail. In England and Wales, 
the forensic analysis of this evidential material is usually carried out at the request of 
the police by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) (Chapter 1, Section 1.3.2). A forensic 
scientist from the FSS will usually work closely with the police, particularly in cases 
of serious crime, such as homicide. If during the course of the police investigation 
into a particular crime, sufficient admissible evidence is accrued, a prosecution can 
be brought (usually by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on behalf of the state) 
against the individual(s) accused of committing the crime in question.
 
This concluding chapter describes the Criminal Justice System in England and 
Wales (Section 14.1) and, within this context, the role of the forensic scientist in 
particular. Critical to the prosecution’s case is the report made by the forensic 
scientist working in conjunction with the police during the investigation, and

compiled from the case notes made during his or her examination of the evidence 
(Section 14.2). In most cases, the forensic scientist’s report is all that is seen by the 
courts. However, in some instances, the forensic scientist is required to be present in 
court in person to answer questions concerning the findings contained within his or 
her report. In this capacity, the forensic scientist appears as an ‘expert witness’ and, 
as such, may express opinions, as well as giving factual information, when required 
to do so, during the trial (Section 14.3). It is worth noting that, as part of the 
adversarial Criminal Justice System that exists in England and Wales, forensic 
scientists may be also be employed by the defence to appear in court as expert 
witnesses (Section 14.3).
14.1 The criminal court system in 
  
  England and Wales
In England and Wales, the arrangement of the criminal court system is a 
hierarchical one (Figure 14.1). The system has two criminal courts where individuals 
are tried, which are therefore said to have ‘first instance criminal jurisdiction’. The 
lower of the two trial courts is the Magistrates’ Court (Section 14.1.1) while the 
higher tier comprises the Crown Courts where individuals are tried by jury (Section 
14.1.2). Further information about the different categories of criminal offence 
recognised within the Criminal Justice System is given in Box 14.1.
 
Above the criminal courts are three courts of appeal – the High Court (Queen’s 
Bench Division), Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) and Supreme Court (Figure 
14.1 and Section 14.1.3). It should be noted that the Crown Court may itself hear 
in England and Wales, individuals accused of 
committing criminal offences may be tried either in 
the Magistrates’ Court (lower criminal court) or in the 
Crown Court (higher criminal court) after committal 
from the Magistrates’ Court. the type of court in which 
the trial of a particular individual takes place will 
depend on a variety of factors, notably the seriousness 
of the offence of which the defendant is accused. 
 
Within the Criminal Justice System, three categories 
of offence are recognised.
Summary only offences
Summary only offences are those that can be tried 
only in a Magistrates’ Court. Such offences are of a 
less serious nature and include, for example, being 
drunk and disorderly, shoplifting and minor motoring 
offences such as careless driving, speeding and taking 
a vehicle without the consent of the owner. trials for 
offences heard in the Magistrates’ Courts (i.e. summary 
only offences and either way offences – see below) 
account for 95 per cent of all criminal trials.
Either way offences
As the name suggests, this type of offence may be tried 
in either of the two criminal courts – the Magistrates’ 
Court or the Crown Court – depending on the seriousness 
of the crime in question. the decision over where the 
trial will take place is made by magistrates at a ‘Mode

should be tried in the Crown Court, the defendant has 
no option in the venue for his or her trial. However, if 
the magistrates are prepared to accept jurisdiction of 
the case, the defendant can either consent to being 
tried summarily in the Magistrates’ Court or elect for 
trial by jury in the Crown Court. the offences that fall 
within the ‘either way’ category tend to be ones whose 
seriousness varies according to the circumstances of 
each individual case. Examples include criminal damage, 
theft and obtaining property by deception.
Indictable only offences
this category covers the most serious of crimes 
and includes murder, rape, death by dangerous 
driving and blackmail. Such cases must be tried on 
indictment in the higher of the two criminal courts – 
the Crown Court.

The Criminal Justice System in England and Wales, in contrast to numerous 
other countries, is based on the principle of adversarial justice. The onus is on 
the prosecution to prove that the person standing trial (known as the defendant) 
is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of committing the crime of which he or she is 
accused. The prosecution must, therefore, be able to present sufficient admissible 
evidence to convince either the magistrate(s) hearing the case or, if the trial is being 
held in the Crown Court, the members of the jury, of the guilt of the defendant.
 
In England and Wales, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), working on behalf 
of the state, is the chief agency responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences. 
Private prosecutions of criminal cases do occur from time to time but they are the 
exception. In the Magistrates’ Court, the prosecuting lawyer, invariably employed 
by the CPS, will usually be a solicitor, although sometimes the prosecuting lawyer 
will be a barrister. In the Crown Court, the CPS is most likely to be represented 
by a barrister or a solicitor-advocate (a solicitor with a higher right of audience 
qualification). It is the role of the lawyer (solicitor or barrister) acting for the 
defendant (i.e. the defence lawyer) to challenge the evidence put forward by the 
prosecution. More information on trial procedure and evidence is given in Box 14.2, 
while Box 14.3 details the case of William Dunlop, the first person to be retried for 
the same offence, after changes to the law on ‘double jeopardy’.
14.1.1  The Magistrates’ Court 
Practically all criminal cases start in the Magistrates’ Court, which constitutes the 
lower of the two criminal courts (Figure 14.1). The vast majority of these cases 
(approximately 95 per cent) are tried by the Magistrates’ Court and completed 
there, while the remainder are committed to the higher criminal court – the Crown 
Court – for either sentencing or trial (Section 14.1.2). Figure 14.2 illustrates, 
by means of a flow diagram, the various routes that may be followed through 
the criminal courts (from first court appearance to conviction) for routine cases 
involving adult defendants.

The criminal courT sysTem in england and wales n 463
The trial forms an essential part of the criminal Justice 
system in england and wales, which is founded on the 
principle of adversarial justice. only individuals who 
contest their guilt (i.e. plead ‘not guilty’ at an appropriate 
stage during their process through the criminal courts) 
will actually be tried, at either the magistrates’ court or 
the crown court as appropriate (Figure 14.2). in practice, 
such individuals are in the minority. in the vast majority of 
cases, the person concerned will choose to plead guilty to 
some or all of the charges against him or her. This decision 
will be made in conjunction with the individual’s legal 
advisor based on his or her assessment of the evidence. 
on occasion, the cPs will withdraw charges against a 
defendant either because of a plea-bargaining arrangement 
(whereby the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a less 
serious allegation, in exchange for the prosecution not 
pursuing a more serious allegation) or because, having 
reviewed the evidence (which may include defence 
expert witness evidence), the cPs now considers there is 
insufficient evidence to prosecute the matter.
 
at trial, a defendant is presumed innocent of the crime 
for which he or she stands accused until proven guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt. The onus is on the prosecuting 
side to present the evidence that will convince the 
presiding magistrate(s) in the magistrates’ court, or the jury 
in the crown court, of the guilt of the defendant. The role 
of the defence is to contest the evidence adduced by the 
prosecution. 
Types of evidence
evidence presented during the course of a trial may be 
broadly classified as:
n real evidence;
n documentary evidence;
n witness evidence.
real evidence (referred to elsewhere in this book as 
physical evidence) consists of items, known in the court 
context as exhibits, such as the knife used in a murder. 
documentary evidence includes, for example, statements 
taken from witnesses, hard copy from computers and video 
recordings. witness evidence may be presented orally by 
the following categories of witnesses, who differ from one 
another in the amount of opinion that they may express:
n witnesses of fact, who are required to give factual 
information concerning only what they personally 
heard or saw and not any opinion; 
n professional witnesses, who are people (e.g. police 
officers) who give evidence that is mostly factual 
but may contain some opinion, and do so during the 
discharge of their professional duties;
n expert witnesses, whose evidence contains both fact 
and, in areas that are outside the common knowledge 
of the court, their personal opinion (the role of the 
forensic scientist as an expert witness is described in 
section 14.3).

 464 n fOREnSiC SCiEnCE in COURt
 
Ministry of Justice statistics for the year 2008 show that 1640 000 defendants 
were proceeded against in Magistrates’ Courts, comprising 593 500 for summary 
non-motoring offences, 649 200 for summary motoring offences and 397 500 for 
indictable offences. In this year, 93.4 per cent of the criminal cases commenced 
in the Magistrates’ Court were completed there, while 6.6 per cent (i.e. 
108 800 persons) were committed to the Crown Court for either trial or sentencing. 
Decisions over issues such as granting bail and the entitlement of the defendant to 
legal aid are also made by the Magistrates’ Court. It should be noted that, as well as 
dealing with criminal cases, Magistrates’ Courts have jurisdiction over a restricted 
number of civil cases, namely family and licensing matters. 
 
Magistrates’ Courts may be presided over either by a panel of three lay 
magistrates (also known as Justices of the Peace, or JPs) or a single district judge 
(previously known as a stipendiary magistrate).
Lay magistrates
Around 30 000 lay magistrates work in the Magistrates’ Courts in England 
and Wales and account for approximately 99.7 per cent of all magistrates. Lay 
magistrates are part-time, unpaid volunteers, who are appointed from the local 
community, in most cases, by the Lord Chancellor (advised by Local Advisory 
Committees composed of local residents, including magistrates). Ideally, the 
composition of any one panel of lay magistrates should be representative of the 
in accordance with the ‘double jeopardy’ rule, which 
dates back over 800 years, an individual acquitted of 
a crime cannot be tried a second time for that same 
offence. However, a change in the law on the retrial of 
serious offences, such as rape and murder, came into 
force on 4 April 2005 in England and Wales (but not in 
Scotland) under the provisions of the Criminal Justice 
Act 2003. this meant that an acquitted person could be 
retried for the same serious crime, provided that ‘new 
and compelling’ evidence not available at the time of 
the original trial (such as DnA evidence, confessions or 
new witnesses) transpired. Pivotal in bringing about this 
reform was the enduring campaign of Mrs Ann Ming, the 
mother of murder victim Julie Hogg, whose killer William 
Dunlop was the first person to be retried as a result of 
this change in the double jeopardy law.
 
Julie Hogg (aged 22) from Billingham, teesside, was 
reported missing in november 1989. Several weeks later, 
her body was discovered behind a bath panel at her 
home by her mother. Local man William Dunlop, who had 
previously been in a brief relationship with the victim, 
was tried for her murder. two juries were unable to 
reach verdicts in his trial, and he was formally acquitted 
at newcastle Crown Court in October 1991. Eight years 
later, in 1999, while serving a seven-year sentence 
for another assault, William Dunlop confessed to the 
murder of Julie Hogg to a prison officer. As a result, 
he received a six-year prison sentence the following 
year (2000), after pleading guilty to perjury. However, 
in 2006, William Dunlop became the first person to be 
retried for the same offence (as a result of the change 
in the double jeopardy law) after the Director of Public 
Prosecutions (DPP) referred his case to the Court of 
Appeal. On 6 October 2006, he was sentenced to life 
imprisonment at the Old Bailey, London, for Julie Hogg’s 
murder, with a minimum tariff of 17 years.

community it serves and this, as well as personal suitability, should be taken into 
account when individual appointments are made. Lay magistrates are not required 
to possess any formal legal qualifications but do receive appropriate training. They 
usually preside over a Magistrates’ Court in threes, all sharing power equally but 
with the senior magistrate acting as chair and spokesperson of the panel. During 
the hearing of a case, lay magistrates are advised by a legally qualified Justices’ 
Clerk on, for example, points of procedure and law. However, the decision over the 
innocence or guilt of the person on trial rests solely with the presiding magistrates. 
District judges
District judges (previously known as stipendiary magistrates) constitute only a 
tiny percentage (0.3 per cent) of the total number of magistrates and are generally 
associated with the larger urban courts, including, traditionally, the Magistrates’ 
Courts of inner city London. In contrast to lay magistrates, these individuals are 
paid, professional lawyers who are employed on a full-time basis. A minimum of 
7 years’ experience working either as a barrister or solicitor is required before 
appointment to the office of district judge can be considered. In comparison with 
lay magistrates, who usually sit on a panel of three, district judges sit alone to hear 
cases. Notwithstanding, the sentencing powers of the individual district judge are 
the same as those of a panel of lay magistrates.
14.1.2  The Crown Court 
The Crown Court is the higher of the two criminal courts and deals with offences of 
a more serious nature, compared with the relatively minor criminal offences sent 
for summary trial in the Magistrates’ Court (Box 14.1). Crown Courts are usually 
associated with cities and large towns, the most famous example being the Central 
Criminal Court in London, otherwise known as the Old Bailey. 
 
After initial proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court, criminal cases will be sent to 
the Crown Court directly, in the case of indictable only offences, or after a Mode of 
Trial hearing in the case of either way offences (Box 14.1). However, if the defendant 
in question pleads guilty to an either way offence at this stage, and therefore no trial 
is required, the Magistrates’ Court will progress to the sentencing stage (Figure 14.2).
 
The Magistrates’ Court may also send cases to the Crown Court for sentencing after 
a defendant has been tried and found guilty in the Magistrates’ Court. This occurs in 
instances where the magistrates feel that their powers of sentencing are insufficient 
for the case in question and referral to the higher criminal court with its greater 
sentencing powers is necessary. Ministry of Justice statistics for the year 2008 show 
that out of the 108 800 persons sent on to the Crown Court from the Magistrates’ 
Court, 89 500 (82.3 per cent) were committed for trial, while 19 300 (17.7 per cent) 
were sent to the higher court for sentencing. Another important aspect of the work of 
the Crown Court is to hear appeals against conviction or sentencing decisions made 
in the Magistrates’ Court (Figure 14.1). Appeals against decisions made by the Crown 
Court itself are heard in the Court of Appeal (Section 14.1.3). 
 
The Crown Court differs from the Magistrates’ Court in that defendants are tried 
by a jury under the auspices of a judge (but see Box 14.4 for a notable exception). 
It is the jury that must decide whether a particular defendant is guilty or not of the 
crime of which he or she stands accused. In order to return a verdict of ‘guilty’, 
there must be agreement between 10 out of the 12 members of the jury hearing the

case. The jurors must reach their decision based on the evidence put before them 
during the trial, which may include that given by an expert witness (Section 14.3). 
For further information on trial procedure, the reader is referred to Box 14.2. 
The jury
A jury is made up of 12 ‘ordinary’ members of the public. The process that leads 
to their appointment is designed to achieve a random mix of individuals within the 
jury and is therefore a very important one. For this reason, the selection process is 
described in some detail below.
 
Individuals are selected at random from the local register of electors and served 
with a jury summons. Once summoned, each individual has a duty to declare:
n any ineligibility for jury service (e.g. because he or she is mentally disordered 
or is a member of the legal profession);
n any disqualification from jury service (e.g. because he or she has been made 
the subject of a community service order within the last decade, or has 
received a sentence of imprisonment of 5 years or more).
Individuals belonging to certain professions, such as the armed forces, may 
be excused from jury service, as of right, while yet others, including those who 
are self-employed, may apply to be excused. If not excluded or excused from jury 
service, all individuals summoned to attend the court must do so, provided that 
they satisfy the following conditions:
n They have been ‘ordinarily resident in the UK for a period of at least five 
years since the age of thirteen’.
n They are aged between 18 and 70 years.
in the first 3 months of 2010, history was made when 
the first trial without jury to occur in 400 years took 
place. the four men on trial at the Old Bailey, London, 
were accused of carrying out an armed robbery at the 
Menzies warehouse at Heathrow Airport in february 
2004, in which £1.75 million was stolen. Several 
employees were tied up and one was shot.
 
Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 
2003, a trial without a jury can be allowed when there 
is a risk of jury tampering.  the three previous trials of 
the defendants had already failed.  in the first two, the 
juries were unable to reach a verdict, while the third 
trial collapsed because of alleged intimidation of jury 
members. in June 2009, the Court of Appeal granted 
leave for the next trial to be conducted without a jury. 
As a result of this fourth trial, presided over by a judge 
sitting alone, all four men were convicted on 31 March 
2010.  their prison sentences ranged from 10 years 9 
months to 20 years 6 months.

Having reached this stage of the selection process, the prospective jurors (whose 
number, usually between 15 and 18, will exceed that required to form a jury) are 
required to attend the relevant Crown Court Centre. These individuals constitute 
what is known as the ‘jury panel’. From this panel, 12 persons are selected by 
random ballot to serve on the jury. At this stage, the defence has a limited right 
to challenge the selection of any particular individual. Once 12 members of the 
jury panel have been called unchallenged, the jury are sworn in and the trial of the 
defendant is able to commence (Box 14.2).
The judges who sit in the Crown Courts
As described previously, the guilt or innocence of a defendant tried in the Crown 
Court is decided by the jury. However, the entire trial proceedings is overseen by a 
judge, who will belong to one of the following categories: 
n High Court judges.
n Circuit judges.
n Recorders and assistant recorders.
High Court judges (sometimes referred to as ‘Red judges’ because of the colour 
of their robes) are the most senior of the categories of judge listed and can try 
all types of criminal offence, including the most serious ones. Circuit judges have 
the same jurisdiction as recorders/assistant recorders (who are part-time judicial 
officers). Both groups can try all but the most serious of the offences committed for 
trial at the Crown Court (unless, in the case of circuit judges, a ‘most serious’ case, 
e.g. of treason, is released by a High Court judge). Appointment to any of these 
categories of Crown Court judge is made by the Lord Chancellor’s Department, 
from solicitors or barristers who have a standing of at least a decade.
 
The role of the judge in the trial proceedings of the Crown Court is an impartial 
one and includes the following aspects:
n to make sure that the defendant receives a fair trial;
n to deal with all points of law, including the admissibility of disputed evidence;
n to sum up the case to the jury, after the closing speeches of the prosecution 
and defence;
n to sentence the defendant, if found guilty, or otherwise order his or her acquittal.
14.1.3  The courts of appeal
There are three courts of appeal within the Criminal Justice System, each of 
which is briefly described below. Cases may be referred to the appropriate court of 
appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) – an independent body 
responsible for the investigation of suspected miscarriages of justice in England, 
Wales and Northern Ireland (Box 14.5).

On 23 february 1998, solicitors Sally and Stephen 
Clark from Wilmslow in Cheshire, UK, were arrested on 
suspicion of the murder of their second son, Harry, 
aged 8 weeks, who had died the previous month (on 26 
January 1998). their first son, Christopher, had died 
14 months previously (on 13 December 1996) aged 
11 weeks. At the time, the Home Office pathologist, 
Dr Alan Williams, put the cause of Christopher’s death 
as a lung infection. However, in his post-mortem 
examination of the Clarks’ second son, Harry, he found 
physical signs that could be consistent with death by 
shaking and, in the light of this, revisited his earlier 
post-mortem results concerning Christopher. As a 
consequence of the pathologist’s findings, a murder 
inquiry was launched into both deaths.
 
On 2 July 1998, Sally Clark was charged with the 
murders of her two sons (the Crown Prosecution 
Service (CPS) having decided to take no further action 
against her husband). She was sent for trial at Chester 
Crown Court in October 1999. On 9 november 1999, 
she was found guilty of murdering her two baby sons 
and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment. Mrs 
Clark always maintained that she was innocent and 
that her babies had died as a result of sudden infant 
death syndrome (SiDS), more commonly known as ‘cot 
death’. Her husband, Stephen, vowed to continue his 
fight to prove his wife’s innocence.
 
During the trial of Sally Clark, a crucial part of 
the prosecution’s case concerned the evidence given  
by expert witness Professor Sir Roy Meadow, an 
experienced paediatrician. He informed the court that 
the chance of cot death occurring twice within the 
same family was 1 in 73 million. He arrived at this 
figure by squaring the estimated chance of a single 
cot death occurring in a family such as the Clarks (i.e. 
non-smokers, relatively affluent) – a probability of 1 
in 8543. However, this calculation did not take into 
account the possibility that environmental or genetic 
factors may make the risk of cot death higher in 
particular families. in other words, the two deaths were 
treated as if they were entirely unrelated to each other. 
 
in July 2000, Sally Clark appealed against her 
sentence to the Court of Appeal, primarily on the basis 
that the statistical evidence presented at the original 
trial was flawed. Although this was accepted by the 
appeal judges, they were still of the opinion that 
the evidence of her guilt was ‘overwhelming’ and, in 
October 2000, her appeal was rejected.
 
in July 2002, fresh evidence concerning Sally Clark’s 
case was brought to the attention of the Criminal 
Cases Review Commission (CCRC). it emerged that 
essential medical evidence concerning the Clark’s 
second son, Harry, had been known to the pathologist 
since february 1998 but not disclosed at the original 
trial. it transpired that Harry had been suffering  
from an infection caused by the bacterium 
Staphylococcus aureus, which could have been 
responsible for his death.
 
As a result of this new evidence, Sally Clark’s case 
was returned by the CCRC to the Court of Appeal. the 
appeal judges ruled that, because of the withholding of 
vital medical evidence, her convictions for the murders of 
Christopher and Harry were unsafe and must be set aside. 
On 29 January 2003, Sally Clark was finally freed from her 
life sentence. 
 
Subsequently, Sally Clark’s father, frank Lockyer, 
brought a complaint against Professor Sir Roy Meadow 
to the general Medical Council (gMC), the professional 
regulatory body for doctors practising medicine in the 
UK.  On 15 July 2005, the fitness to Practise Panel 
(fPP) of the gMC found Professor Sir Roy Meadow guilty 
of serious professional misconduct, for presenting 
‘erroneous’ and ‘misleading’ evidence in the 1999 trial 
of Sally Clark, and ordered that his name be removed 
from the medical register.
 
in response, Professor Sir Roy Meadow appealed to 
the High Court against the finding of the gMC’s fPP 
and the penalty that it consequently imposed. On 
17 february 2006, the High Court judge allowed his 
appeal, finding him not guilty of serious professional 
misconduct and quashing the penalty of his erasure 
from the medical register. the judge also ruled

The High Court (Queen’s Bench Division)
The High Court has jurisdiction in both criminal and civil matters. It is divided into 
three divisions: the Family Division, the Chancery Division and the Queen’s Bench 
Division. It is the last of these, the Queen’s Bench Division, that deals with appeals 
concerning criminal cases. These may emanate from either of the criminal courts, 
namely the Magistrates’ Court or the Crown Court. Appeals from the Magistrates’ 
Court, for example, are usually connected with points of law and may be made by 
either the prosecution or the defence (Figure 14.1). Appeals in the High Court are 
heard by one High Court Judge and one Lord Justice of Appeal (Table 14.1).
The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)
The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters and is 
composed of a Civil Division and a Criminal Division. The Criminal Division hears 
appeals from the Crown Court (Figure 14.1). These may be made by the defence 
against conviction and/or sentence, or by the prosecution in cases where the 
sentence given to a defendant is felt to be unduly lenient. Normally, three judges sit 
in the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal (Table 14.1). This panel may consist 
of three Lord Justices of Appeal (which may include the Lord Chief Justice); one 
Lord Justice of Appeal plus two High Court judges; or a combination of one Lord 
Justice of Appeal, one High Court judge and one circuit judge.
The Supreme Court
As a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the judicial appeal role of the 
House of Lords was transferred to the new Supreme Court in October 2009. The 
Supreme Court of the UK now represents the highest court in the Criminal Justice 
System and is entirely separate from Parliament. In England and Wales, it receives 
appeals concerning publicly important points of law from the Criminal Division 
of the Court of Appeal and also, on occasion, from the Queen’s Bench Division of 
the High Court (Figure 14.1). Such appeals may be made by either the prosecution 
or the defence and are heard by the Justices of the Supreme Court, of which there 
are 12. 
that expert witnesses should have immunity from 
disciplinary action from their respective regulatory 
bodies. As a consequence, the gMC warned: ‘the ruling 
would place doctors acting as expert witnesses in court 
cases beyond the reach of its scrutiny’.  
 
A subsequent appeal brought by the gMC to the 
Court of Appeal led to the overturn of this High Court 
ruling on expert witness immunity from disciplinary 
action, on 26 October 2006.  However, the Court of 
Appeal upheld the previous High Court finding that 
Professor Sir Roy Meadow was not guilty of serious 
professional misconduct.  it should be noted that, 
in its appeal, the gMC did not seek to reinstate the 
penalty of removal from the medical register for 
Professor Sir Roy Meadow.

14.2 The forensic scientist’s report 
  
   for use in court
During the processing of a crime scene, any material, such as hairs, fibres, 
fingerprints or samples of body fluids, that may be of evidential value to the police 
investigation is recovered and sent for forensic analysis (Chapter 2). In England and 
Wales, the police have access to the necessary forensic expertise, currently, mainly 
through the comprehensive range of services offered by the Forensic Science Service 
(FSS). A forensic scientist from the FSS usually works in close association with the 
police during the course of their investigation, especially in cases of a more serious 
nature, such as murder. He or she will either personally examine the various types 
of forensic evidence submitted by the police, or arrange for colleagues with relevant 
expertise to perform the necessary tests. The results of this forensic examination 
are written up as case notes. These case notes will form the basis of the forensic 
scientist’s report for use by the prosecuting side in court. 
 
The forensic scientist’s report is a very important document, representing, as it 
does, the culmination of all the labour that has been expended during the conduct 
of a criminal investigation. It is often instrumental in persuading a defendant to 
plead guilty, thus obviating the need for a trial. Many factors must be taken into 
account when preparing such a report for use in court. For example, it is vital that 
the report is both comprehensive and written in a manner that makes its contents 
easily understandable to non-scientists, such as lawyers, the police, and the jury 
or magistrates hearing the case. This is necessary because the report is usually 
admitted for use in court unaccompanied by the forensic scientist who compiled 
it. It is only in a tiny minority of cases that the forensic scientist is required by the 
court to appear in person as an expert witness (Section 14.3).
 
The content of the report prepared for use in court by the forensic scientist is 
prescribed by rules concerning expert evidence set out in The Criminal Procedure 
(Amendment No. 2) Rules 2006, which came into force on 6 November 2006. These 
rules have remained unchanged in The Criminal Procedure Rules 2010. The relevant 
extract is given below:
33.3 – (1) An expert’s report must –
(a) give details of the expert’s qualifications, relevant experience and accreditation;
(b) give details of any literature or other information which the expert has relied 
on in making the report;
(c) contain a statement setting out the substance of all facts given to the expert 
which are material to the opinions expressed in the report or upon which 
those opinions are based;
(d) make clear which of the facts stated in the report are within the expert’s own 
knowledge;
(e) say who carried out any examination, measurement, test or experiment which 
the expert has used for the report and – 
(i) give the qualifications, relevant experience and accreditation of that 
person,

 
 472 n fOREnSiC SCiEnCE in COURt
(ii) say whether or not the examination, measurement, test or experiment 
was carried out under the expert’s supervision, and
(iii) summarise the findings on which the expert relies;
(f) where there is a range of opinion on the matters dealt with in the report –
(i) summarise the range of opinion, and
(ii) give reasons for his own opinion;
(g) if the expert is not able to give his opinion without qualification, state the 
qualification;
(h) contain a summary of the conclusions reached;
(i) contain a statement that the expert understands his duty to the court, and 
has complied and will continue to comply with that duty; and
(j) contain the same declaration of truth as a witness statement.
Crown copyright material is reproduced with the permission of the Controller of HMSO and the 
Queen’s Printer for Scotland.
Although the discussion to date has concentrated on the forensic scientist’s report 
as prepared for the prosecution, in some cases independent forensic reports may 
also be commissioned by lawyers acting for the defendant. If such a report is to 
be relied on in court, the defence must disclose it to the prosecution before trial. 
(The process whereby documentary evidence is shown by one party (i.e. defence or 
prosecution) to the other before trial is known as pre-trial disclosure.) However, 
if it transpires that the contents of the report commissioned by the defence prove 
to be unhelpful to the defendant, and it is therefore decided not to make use of 
the report in court, the defence does not have to disclose it to the opposing side.  
In contrast, the law requires the prosecution to make pre-trial disclosure of 
evidence (including forensic evidence), both advantageous and disadvantageous to 
the prosecution’s case, to the defence.
 
It should be noted that the circumstances under which a forensic scientist’s report 
is prepared for the defence differ in several important respects from that compiled 
for the prosecution. Although the police currently purchase their forensic services 
largely from the FSS, defence lawyers usually obtain the necessary expertise through 
small, independent companies (although these boundaries are beginning to become 
less clear cut). In the case of a legally aided defendant, the prior authorisation of the 
Criminal Defence Service will normally be sought in order to ‘purchase’ independent 
expertise. The forensic scientist working for the prosecution is usually involved in a 
criminal case from the start of the investigation and consequently has first sight of 
the various items of evidence recovered from the crime scene. The forensic scientist 
engaged by the defence will therefore only have access to the evidence second-hand 
and will not be able to view the material in its original state. 
 
The difference in the condition of the evidence before and after forensic 
examination can be significant. For example, the forensic examination of ‘foreign’ 
fibres from an article of clothing will necessitate their removal from that garment. 
When seen by the forensic scientist working for the defence, the evidence will 
consist of the garment plus the tape lifts of the recovered fibres. In practice, the 
second forensic scientist (i.e. the one working for the defence) usually compiles 
his or her report using information and the test results obtained by the first (i.e. 
the prosecution) forensic scientist, who must disclose this information to them. It

is not usual for the defence forensic scientist to carry out his or her own scientific 
tests. The time available to the second forensic scientist is relatively short compared 
with that available to the first. However, the second forensic scientist does have 
the advantage of having access to the defendant’s version of events, which may be 
germane to the interpretation of the evidence assembled by the prosecution side. 
 
It is worth emphasising that the role of the forensic scientist in preparing the 
report, and, if required, appearing in court as an expert witness, is an impartial one. 
This means that if any of his or her findings are inconsistent with the aims of the 
side (either prosecution or defence) for which the report was commissioned, such 
information should not be withheld by the forensic scientist. Thus the obligations 
to make pre-trial disclosure of evidence on the part of the forensic scientist extend 
to all experiments and tests that tend to cast doubt on the opinion the scientist is 
expressing, and he or she must bring such information to the attention of the party 
instructing him or her. However, as previously stated, there is no obligation on the 
defence to disclose an unfavourable report, provided no reliance is being placed on 
that report in court.
14.3 The role of the forensic scientist 
  
   as expert witness
As mentioned in the previous section, it is only in a very small number of cases that 
the forensic scientist is required to appear in court in person and give oral evidence 
as an expert witness. The term ‘expert witness’ may be defined as a non-lawyer 
who has expertise in a particular area that is outside the common knowledge of 
the court and who gives evidence of opinion as well as of fact. Examples other than 
forensic scientists include doctors, psychiatrists, forensic archaeologists, document 
examiners and structural engineers. Expert witnesses, like all other witnesses, are 
immune from civil lawsuits in respect of the evidence they give in court. However, 
this protection does not extend to immunity from disciplinary action from their 
respective professional regulatory bodies, for example the General Medical Council 
in the case of doctors in the UK (for details of the case concerning Professor Sir Roy 
Meadow, see Box 14.5).
 
Support and training for expert witnesses is provided by the Expert Witness 
Institute (EWI), an independent body launched in 1996. Expert witnesses are involved 
in civil cases, as well as in criminal ones. However, the forensic scientist as expert 
witness is more likely to be involved in the trial of criminal offences. The expert’s duty 
to the court as prescribed in The Criminal Procedure Rules 2010 is given in Box 14.6 
and discussed more generally in the main text below.
 
A forensic scientist may be called to appear in court as an expert witness by 
either the prosecution or the defence. In cases where such an expert is instructed 
by the prosecuting side, it is likely that the defence will also bring in its own 
independent forensic expert in order to test the strength of the scientific evidence 
presented by the prosecution. Regardless of which side has instructed him or her to 
give an expert opinion, the forensic scientist must remain impartial and objective 
at all times. It is the duty of the forensic scientist to help the court to come to its 
decision by giving independent evidence of fact and of opinion based on fact from 
within his or her field of expertise. It is the task of the lawyers from each side to

win the case on which they are engaged (provided that they operate in accordance 
with the proper procedure expected of them) and for those charged with decision-
making (i.e. the jury or magistrates, depending on the court) to determine the guilt 
or innocence of the defendant. 
 
In court, the expert witness is permitted to view the proceedings of the case 
with the permission of the court. When called to the witness box, the expert is 
allowed to bring a clean copy of the report he or she has compiled (i.e. one that is 
without annotation), in order to make reference to relevant parts of it when 
answering questions. After taking the oath or affirmation, the examination 
in chief of the expert witness (i.e. by the side that has instructed the expert 
witness) begins. After giving his or her name and work address, the expert witness is 
usually asked questions concerning his or her qualifications and, sometimes, about 
relevant experience. Successive questioning often follows the progression of the report 
and allows the forensic scientist to demonstrate the strengths of his or her 
expert opinion. 
 
This stage is followed by cross-examination by the opposing side, during which 
the evidence of fact and opinion of the forensic scientist in the witness box is 
rigorously tested and, if possible, discredited. The conclusions presented in the 
written report are based on what the forensic scientist considers the most likely 
interpretation of the results of the scientific tests. It is highly probable that the 
opposing side will attack both the accuracy of the test results and the interpretation 
of these findings by the forensic scientist. For example, it may try to persuade 
the court that other interpretations of the evidence are more likely than the one 
put forward by the expert instructed by the opposition. The forensic scientist 
under cross-examination must therefore be prepared to defend the conclusions 
that appear in his or her report. However, the forensic scientist, as an impartial 
participant in the court proceedings, should concede if he or she feels that an 
alternative explanation could be possible. Ultimately, it is for the jury or magistrates 
to decide which interpretation of the findings is most probable in the context of 
the case. (For further information on the interpretation and evaluation of scientific 
evidence, see Chapter 13.)
Cross-examination
The questioning in

appearing for the 
defence by the 
prosecution or, 
conversely, of a 
witness appearing 
for the prosecution 
by the defence.
Examination in chief
The initial 
examination of 
a witness by the 
side (i.e. either 
the prosecution or 
defence) responsible 
for calling him 
or her.
33.2 – (1)  An expert must help the court to achieve the overriding objective by giving objective, unbiased opinion 
on matters within his expertise.
 
 
(2)  this duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom he receives instructions or by whom he is 
paid.
 
 
(3)  this duty includes an obligation to inform all parties and the court if the expert's opinion changes from 
that contained in a report served as evidence or given in a statement.

Cross-examination forms a necessary part of the adversarial system of criminal 
justice and it is important that the expert witness remains calm and professional 
throughout his or her court appearance, especially during this stage of the proceedings. 
The manner in which the expert witness delivers his or her evidence in court has 
been shown to have a direct bearing on the way it is perceived by those involved in 
the decision-making. Clear and effective communication is therefore essential. Ideally, 
answers should be concise yet detailed enough to enable the jurors or magistrates to 
understand their content and therefore comprehend their relevance to the case in 
hand. The expert witness should address his or her answers directly to the magistrate(s) 
in a Magistrates’ Court, or, in criminal cases in the Crown Court, to the jury and judge.
 
Cross-examination may be succeeded by re-examination of the expert witness by 
the side that instructed him or her (Box 14.2). It should be noted, however, that 
it is not permissible for new evidence to be introduced at this stage. At the end of 
giving evidence, the expert witness is usually released by the court and is therefore 
free to leave.
14.4 The interpretation and evaluation 
  
   of evidence
The role of the forensic scientist as expert witness is to assist the court in reaching 
its decision over the guilt or innocence of the defendant standing trial (Section 
14.3). He or she gives evidence of fact and, importantly, of opinion based on fact 
when required to do so by the court. Such opinion evidence should be confined to 
within the expert’s region of knowledge and, if questions fall outside this area, the 
expert witness should make this clear to the court. As mentioned previously, the 
expert witness, whether appearing for the prosecution or the defence, should be 
impartial and objective throughout the court proceedings. 
 
The forensic scientist instructed by the prosecution may be the only forensic 
scientist to appear in court as an expert witness during the hearing of a particular 
criminal trial. However, the defence side may also instruct its own independent 
forensic scientist, especially where the case to be made by the prosecution places a 
heavy reliance on scientific evidence. The forensic scientist engaged by the defence 
scrutinises the scientific work brought forward by the prosecution and makes sure 
that it is clearly understood by the defence lawyers. This will enable the defence to 
challenge the prosecution’s case more effectively. Furthermore, the forensic scientist 
concerned may be called by the defence to appear in court as an expert witness.
 
When facing cross-examination by the defence, the prosecution’s scientific expert 
witness is likely to be challenged in two key areas. These are:
n the accuracy of the test results obtained from the forensic examination of 
evidential objects;
n the interpretation and evaluation of the scientific test results thus obtained.
With regard to the accuracy of the test results, the defence may raise the possibility 
of cross-contamination during the collection, transportation, storage and/or testing 
of the evidence concerned. However, the risk of cross-contamination of evidence has 
been significantly decreased by the training of Scenes of Crime Officers (SOCOs) 

 
 476 n fOREnSiC SCiEnCE in COURt
and the establishment of a clear chain of custody for items of physical evidence 
(Chapter 2).
 
Under cross-examination, the interpretation and evaluation of the scientific test 
results by the forensic scientist is likely to constitute the most significant area of 
contention. As mentioned previously, the opinion of the forensic scientist is formed 
by what he or she considers to be the most probable proposition that would account 
for the results. One important method that has been developed to assist the forensic 
scientist in this matter involves the evaluation of likelihood ratios (Chapter 13, 
Section 13.6). Importantly, the forensic scientist must be careful in the way that he or 
she expresses his or her opinions. In particular, the forensic scientist should not make 
any statements that directly imply the guilt, or otherwise, of the defendant standing 
trial. Such decisions are the province of the jurors, or magistrates, hearing the case. 
Problems
1. With reference to the criminal courts in England and Wales, and by use of 
examples, explain what is meant by each of the following:
(a) summary only offences;
(b) either way offences;
(c) indictable only offences.
2. The Criminal Justice System in England and Wales is based on the principle 
of adversarial justice. How is this enacted through the trial procedure of the 
criminal courts?
n in England and Wales, the courts within the Criminal Justice 
System are arranged in a hierarchy. there are two criminal 
courts where individuals are tried, namely the Magistrates’ 
Court (lower criminal court) and the Crown Court (higher 
criminal court), and three courts of appeal, namely the High 
Court (Queen’s Bench Division), the Court of Appeal (Criminal 
Division) and the Supreme Court. the trial destination of any 
particular criminal offence will depend on its classification. 
three broad categories of criminal offence are recognised: 
summary only offences (tried only in the Magistrates’ Court), 
either way offences (tried either in the Magistrates’ Court or 
the Crown Court) and indictable only offences (tried only in 
the Crown Court). 
n the trial of criminal offences in England and Wales is based 
on the principle of adversarial justice. Briefly, this means 
that in court, the prosecution adduces evidence intended 
to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is 
guilty of the crime for which he or she stands accused. in 
response, the defence lawyer challenges by attempting to 
raise reasonable doubt about the prosecution’s case. the 
aim of each side, therefore, is to win the case in hand. 
However, it is the task of the decision-makers (represented 
by the magistrate(s) in the lower criminal courts or the jury 
in the Crown Court) to decide whether the defendant is 
guilty or not guilty. 
n the role of the forensic scientist within the Criminal 
Justice System is a very important one. A forensic scientist 
is often closely involved in the police investigation of 
criminal offences, especially where these are of a more 
serious nature. He or she will be responsible for carrying 
out (or arranging for others to perform) the necessary 
scientific tests on the forensic evidence recovered from the 
crime scene and for the preparation of a comprehensive 
report for use in court. in a tiny minority of cases, the 
forensic scientist is obliged to appear personally in court 
as an expert witness and to give evidence of fact and, 
when required, of opinion based on fact from within his or 
her area of expertise. When facing cross-examination, the 
forensic expert is likely to be challenged by the opposition 
over the accuracy of the scientific test results and, in 
particular, the interpretation and evaluation he or she has 
made of these results within the context of the case. it 
should be emphasised that he or she must remain impartial 
at all times; it is not the role of the forensic scientist to 
ascribe the guilt or innocence of the individual on trial.
14.5 Summary

3. Compare and contrast the role of:
(a) lay magistrates and district judges (Magistrates’ Court);
(b) the judge and jurors (Crown Court).
4. Which individuals act as decision-makers in (a) the Magistrates’ Court and (b) 
the Crown Court? In each case, outline the selection process involved. How 
representative do you think the selected individuals are of the lay population?
5. The forensic scientist’s report prepared for use by the prosecution in court 
is an extremely important document. Discuss the main features that should 
be covered by a report of this type. Why is it important that it is written in a 
style that is readily comprehensible to non-scientists?
6. What is an expert witness? With reference to a forensic scientist acting in 
this capacity, describe the role of the expert witness in court.
7. Under cross-examination, which aspects of the evidence presented by the 
forensic scientist (appearing as an expert witness) are likely to be challenged 
by the opposition? How might the forensic expert respond to such attacks?
