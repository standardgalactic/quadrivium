Acknowledgments
This book would not have been possible without the efforts of many dedicated people. First, thanks 
to Michelle Grandin, acquisitions editor, for her dedication and guidance during the development of 
this book. A special thanks to Deb Doorley, development editor, whose guidance and expertise 
helped me become a better writer. Deb’s special attention to detail signiﬁcantly improved this book. 
Thanks to Andrew Cupp for his guidance. Thanks to San Dee Phillips, project editor, for taking care 
of the ﬁnal, signiﬁcant details. Thanks to Brett Bartow, executive editor, for his vision. And special 
thanks to John Kane, Editor-in-Chief; thanks for getting me started with Cisco Press in 1999. 
Thanks to all other Cisco Press team members who worked behind the scenes to make this a better 
book. A special thanks to the technical reviewers: Dave Nichols, Donnie Williams, and Ken Zuhr. 
Their technical advice and careful attention to detail made this book accurate. Very special thanks 
to Anthony Sequeira and Gert De Laet for arriving at the last minute to contribute some of the

the development of this book.
—Anthony Bruno
I would like to thank Michelle Grandin, my editor, for her support and strength. Thanks to Deb 
Doorley, without whom the book could not be possible. Most of all, thanks to John Kane for 
the opportunities that made my dream a reality. Next, I would like to thank Ken Yanneck, Mike 
Connally, Ernie Small, and Mark Graber at IPLogic. Thank you, gentlemen, for giving me more than 
a workplace and being more than just coworkers. Although it wouldn’t be possible to thank each 
member of the IPLogic team individually, your support and knowledge has helped me to complete 
this project. To Bob Burdick: You were the ﬁrst friend I made in Albany, and now I can’t imagine 
my life without you. You have taught me a great deal about friendship in the short time I have known 
you; I couldn’t have asked for a better teacher.

preparation.
Cisco and Cisco Press present this material in text-based format to provide another learning vehicle 
for our customers and the broader user community in general. Although a publication does not 
duplicate the instructor-led or e-learning environment, we acknowledge that not everyone responds 
in the same way to the same delivery mechanism. It is our intent that presenting this material through 
a Cisco Press publication will enhance the transfer of knowledge to a broad audience of networking 
professionals.
Cisco Press will present study guides on existing and future exams through these Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guides to help achieve Cisco Internet Learning Solutions Group’s principle objectives: to educate 
the Cisco community of networking professionals and to enable that community to build and main-
tain reliable, scalable networks. The Cisco Career Certiﬁcations and classes that support these cer-
tiﬁcations are directed at meeting these objectives through a disciplined approach to progressive 
learning. In order to succeed on the Cisco Career Certiﬁcations exams, as well as in your daily job as 
a Cisco certiﬁed professional, we recommend a blended learning solution that combines instructor-
led, e-learning, and self-study training with hands-on experience. Cisco Systems has created an 
authorized Cisco Learning Partner program to provide you with the most highly qualiﬁed instruction 
and invaluable hands-on experience in lab and simulation environments. To learn more about Cisco 
Learning Partner programs available in your area, please go to www.cisco.com/go/training.

Introduction
So you have worked on Cisco devices for a while, designing networks for your customers, and now 
you want to get certiﬁed? There are several good reasons to do so. The Cisco certiﬁcation program 
permits network analysts and engineers to demonstrate their competence in different areas of net-
working and at different levels. The prestige and respect that come with a Cisco certiﬁcation will 
deﬁnitely help you in your career. Your clients, peers, and superiors will recognize you as an expert 
in networking.
The Cisco Certiﬁed Design Associate (CCDA) is the entry-level certiﬁcation, which represents 
knowledge of the foundation of the design of Cisco internetwork infrastructure.
The routing and switching path has various levels of certiﬁcation. CCDA is the entry-level certiﬁ-
cation in the Network Design track. The next step, Cisco Certiﬁed Design Professional (CCDP), 
requires you to demonstrate advanced knowledge of network design. The Cisco Certiﬁed Internet-
work Expert (CCIE) requires an expert level of knowledge on internetworking.
The test to obtain CCDA certiﬁcation is called Designing for Cisco Internetwork Solutions (DESGN) 
Exam #640-861. It is a computer-based test that has between 70 and 80 questions and a 75-minute 
time limit. Because all exam information is managed by Cisco Systems and is therefore subject to 
change, candidates should continually monitor the Cisco Systems site for course and exam updates 
at www.cisco.com/go/training.
You can take the exam at Sylvan Prometric or VUE testing centers. You can register with Prometric 
at http://www.2test.com. You can register with VUE at http://www.vue.com. The cost of the exam 
is US$125. The CCDA certiﬁcation is valid for three years.
The CCDA exam measures your ability to design networks that meet certain requirements for per-
formance, security, capacity, and scalability. The exam focuses on small- to medium-sized networks. 
The candidate should have at least one year of experience in the design of small- to medium-sized 
networks using Cisco products. A CCDA candidate should understand internetworking technolo-
gies, including the Enterprise Composite Network Model, routing, switching, WAN technologies, 
LAN protocols, voice networks, and network management. 
Cisco suggests working through the course Designing for Cisco Internetwork Solutions (DESGN) 
before you take the CCDA exam. For more information on the various levels of certiﬁcation, career 
tracks, and Cisco exams, go to the Cisco Learning and Events page at www.cisco.com/go/training.
About This Book
CCDA Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, Second Edition, is intended to help you prepare for the design por-
tion of the CCDA exam, recognize and improve your areas of weakness, and increase your chances 

 xxv
of passing the test. The book is designed to provide you with mastery of the CCDA design objec-
tives. It is recommended that you take the DESGN course or acquire an equivalent amount of on-
the-job training before solidifying your CCDA knowledge with this book. 
Because the scope of this book is helping you master the CCDA exam design objectives, the authors 
assume that you have a certain level of internetworking knowledge. If you lack experience with 
internetworking technologies, it is strongly recommended that you review the Internetworking 
Technologies Handbook, Second Edition, from Cisco Press.
At the beginning of each chapter, you will ﬁnd a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz to help you assess 
the degree to which you need to review the subject matter covered in that chapter. You can then read 
the entire chapter thoroughly or skip directly to only those sections that you need to review further. 
In addition, at the end of each chapter is a “Q&A” review quiz. Use it after you read the chapter to 
determine your knowledge of the topics.
Objective of This Book
The objective of this book is to help you fully understand, remember, and recall details of the design 
topics covered on the CCDA exam. The CCDA exam will be a stepping stone for most people as 
they progress through the other Cisco certiﬁcations; passing the exam because of a thorough 
understanding and recall of the topics will be incredibly valuable at the next steps.
This book prepares you to pass the CCDA exam by doing the following:
I
Helping you discover which design topics you have not mastered
I
Providing explanations and information to ﬁll in your knowledge gaps
I
Supplying exercises and case studies that enhance your ability to recall and deduce the answers 
to test questions
I
Providing a practice exam and exercises on the CD-ROM that help you assess your overall 
progress and preparation level for the CCDA exam
Who Should Read This Book?
This book is intended to tremendously increase your chances of passing the CCDA exam. This book 
is intended for an audience who has taken the course Designing for Cisco Internetwork Solutions or 
has an equivalent level of on-the-job experience. Although others might beneﬁt from using this 
book, the book is written assuming that you want to pass the exam.
Why should you want to pass CCDA? For many reasons: to get a raise; to show your manager you 
are working hard to increase your skills; to fulﬁll a manager’s requirement (before he will spend 
money on another course); to enhance your résumé; because you work in a presales job at a reseller 

xxvi 
and want to eventually become CCDP certiﬁed; or to prove you know the topic, if you learned 
through on-the-job experience rather than from the prerequisite classes.
Have You Mastered All the Exam Objectives?
The exam tests you on a wide variety of topics; most people will not remember all the topics on the 
exam. Because some study is required, this book focuses on helping you obtain the maximum 
beneﬁt from the time you spend preparing for the design portion of the exam. You can access many 
other sources for the information covered on the exam; for example, you can read the Cisco 
documentation CD-ROM. This book, however, provides a proven format of effective, late-stage 
preparation for the exam.
You should begin your exam preparation by spending ample time reviewing the exam objectives 
listed in the section “CCDA Exam Objectives,” later in this introduction. Because exam objectives 
change from time to time, check out the Cisco website for any future changes to the list of objectives.
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains the following parts:
Part I: General Network Design (Chapters 1–3)
Part II: LAN and WAN Design (Chapters 4–8)
Part III: The Internet Protocol and Routing Protocols (Chapters 9–14)
Part IV: Security, Convergence, and Network Management (Chapters 15–19)
Part V: Comprehensive Scenarios (Chapter 20)
Part VI: Appendixes
The book begins with a chapter that generally deﬁnes the design topics that are covered by the 
CCDA exam. Before you begin studying for any exam, it is important that you know the topics that 
might be covered. With the CCDA exam, knowing what is on the exam is seemingly 
straightforward; Cisco publishes a list of CCDA objectives. The objectives, however, are certainly 
open to interpretation.
Chapters 1 through 19 cover the Cisco CCDA exam design objectives and provide detailed 
information on each objective. Each chapter begins with a quiz so that you can quickly determine 
your current level of readiness. Each chapter ends with a review summary and Q&A quiz.

 xxvii
Chapter 20, “Comprehensive Scenarios,” provides scenario-based questions for further comprehen-
sive study. Some of the questions in the CCDA test might be based on a scenario design.
Appendix A, “Answers to Chapter ‘Do I Know This Already?’ Quizzes and Q&A Sections,” 
provides the answers to the various chapter quizzes. 
Appendix B, “The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion,” reviews the Open Systems 
Interconnection (OSI) reference model, which provides a better understanding of internetworking. 
The appendix also reviews the techniques to convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal num-
bers. Although there might not be a speciﬁc question on the exam about converting a binary number 
to decimal, it is necessary to know how to convert these numbers in order to do problems in the test.
Appendix C, “References and Recommended Readings,” provides a list of references used in this 
book and recommended reading. The books, URLs, and RFCs listed include additional information 
on the covered subjects.
The book also includes a glossary of the most important CCDA terms and acronyms.
Finally, in the back of the book you will ﬁnd an invaluable CD-ROM. It contains exercise questions 
on study cards and ﬂash cards that provide answer explanations and links to the appropriate section 
in an electronic version of the book. The CD-ROM also enables you to take a timed practice CCDA 
exam that is similar in format to the actual CCDA exam you will be taking. The practice exam is 
complete with both general knowledge and case-study questions. The practice exam has a database 
of more than 200 questions, so you can test yourself more than once.
Features of This Book
This book features the following:
I
“Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes—Each chapter begins with a quiz that helps you deter-
mine the amount of time you need to spend studying that chapter. If you follow the directions 
at the beginning of the chapter, the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz directs you to study all or 
particular parts of the chapter.
I
Foundation Topics—These are the core sections of each chapter. They explain the protocols, 
concepts, and conﬁguration for the topics in that chapter. If you need to learn about the topics 
in a chapter, read the “Foundation Topics” section.
I
Foundation Summaries—Near the end of each chapter, a summary collects the most important 
information from the chapter summarized in lists, tables, and ﬁgures. The “Foundation Sum-
mary” section is designed to help you review the key concepts in the chapter if you scored well 
on the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz. This section is an excellent tool for last-minute review.

xxviii 
I
Q&A—Each chapter ends with a “Q&A” section that forces you to exercise your recall of the 
facts and processes described inside that chapter. The questions are generally harder than the 
actual exam. These questions are a great way to increase the accuracy of your recollection of 
the facts.
I
Case Studies—Chapter 20 is a complete chapter of case studies that you should read and work 
on after you feel you have mastered all the objectives presented in the book. The CCDA exam 
will most likely include some questions based on a design case study.
I
Test Questions—Using the test engine on the CD-ROM, you can take simulated exams. You 
can also choose to be presented with several questions on an objective that you need more work 
on. This testing tool provides you with practice to make you more comfortable when you 
actually take the CCDA exam.

If your knowledge of a particular chapter’s subject matter is strong, you might want to proceed 
directly to that chapter’s exercises to assess your true level of preparedness. If you have difﬁculty 
with those exercises, make sure to read over that chapter’s “Foundation Topics.” Also, be sure to test 
yourself by using the CD-ROM’s test engine. Finally, if you are lacking in certain internetworking-
technologies knowledge, be sure to review the reference materials provided in the appendixes. No 
matter your background, you should begin with Chapter 1.
Test Preparation, Test-Taking Tips, and Using This Book
This section contains recommendations that you can choose to follow to increase your probability 
of passing the CCDA written exam.
The following are some additional suggestions for using this book and preparing for the exam:
I
Familiarize yourself with the exam objectives in Table I-1 and thoroughly read the chapters on 
topics that you are not familiar with. Use the assessment tools provided in this book to identify 
areas where you need additional study. The assessment tools include the “Do I Know This 
Already?” quizzes, the “Q&A” questions, and the sample exam questions on the CD-ROM.
I
Take all quizzes in this book and review the answers and the answer explanations. It is not 
enough to know the correct answer, but you need to also understand why it is correct and why 
the others are incorrect. Retake the chapter quizzes until you pass with 100 percent.
I
Take the CD-ROM test in this book and review the answers. Use your results to identify areas 
where you need additional preparation.
I
Review other documents, RFCs, and the Cisco website for additional information. If this book 
references an outside source, it’s a good idea to spend some time looking at it. 
I
Review the chapter questions and CD-ROM questions the day before your scheduled test. 
Review each chapter’s “Foundation Summary” when you are making your ﬁnal preparations. 
I
On the test date, arrive at least 20 minutes before your test time. This plan will give time to 
register and glance through your notes before the test without feeling rushed or anxious.
I
If you are not sure which is the answer to a question, attempt to eliminate incorrect answers.

Design Principles
This chapter describes the importance of an organization’s network policies through an intro-
duction of the global network business model and covers other signiﬁcant design principles, 
such as top-down design, requirements and constraints, and network design tools.
More speciﬁcally, this chapter discusses design principles, examining the requirements and 
constraints of a network both from a business and a technical perspective after explaining the 
global network business model and the top-down design concepts.
This chapter explores design tools through some of the activities, techniques, and tools used in 
today’s network-design process, for auditing networks and analyzing and simulating network 
trafﬁc.
”Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you need to

Organizational Network Policies and Procedures     9
Foundation Topics
This chapter describes the design principles and the importance of organizational network policies 
and procedures. It includes a discussion of top-down design practices; the requirements and 
constraints involved with such; and the design activities, tools, and techniques, including auditing 
existing networks.
Fundamentally, you break the network-design process into manageable blocks so that the network 
functions within the performance and scale limits of applications, protocols, and network services.
The network infrastructure itself is an important component in the design process because it 
transports the application and network-management trafﬁc. The designed network infrastructure 
must meet at least three high-level goals:
I
It should provide timely and reliable transport.
I
It should be adaptable to satisfy ever-changing application demands.
I
The cost of future growth to meet the needs of business or information expansion should be 
appropriate to the extent of the required changes.
Building a network infrastructure requires a lot of planning, designing, modeling, and, most 
importantly, information-gathering. Network designers have many technologies to consider. The 
functionality of the selected technology and networking equipment is important because it might 
need to conform to standards to provide interoperability and it must be able to perform the tasks 
required by the network architecture.
The network architecture, an intermediate network design, provides a “blueprint” for the detailed 
design activities required to realize a functioning network infrastructure.
When designing networks, it is important to look at available resources you have to implement the 
new network architecture but also be sensitive to the quantity and quality of the resources available 
to operate and manage the network.
Organizational Network Policies and Procedures 
Organizations, and their leadership teams, realize how networks can deliver operational efﬁciencies 
for current activities. The network can seamlessly link organizations to their direct customers, 
clients, business partners, suppliers, and employees, allowing them to share information and 
conduct business worldwide. To effectively operate globally, organizations must use their networks, 
and the Internet, as fully integrated components of all activities. The beneﬁts of becoming a global 

10     Chapter 1: Design Principles
network organization include improved productivity and greater economic efﬁciency. These beneﬁts 
can be substantial. Cisco itself offers a prime example for other organizations seeking to leverage 
the power of their networks for business advantage. In the early 1990s, Cisco was a young 
technology company experiencing high growth and global expansion. Orders were escalating. The 
operations and support groups were stretched to their limits. As its business grew, Cisco had to ﬁnd 
a way to minimize the required growth of staff and business systems yet still maintain, or improve, 
high levels of quality and customer satisfaction. For today’s uncertain environment, this model has 
been altered toward the networked virtual organization model.
What Is a Global Network Business? 
A global network business can be best described as a model that provides access to all relevant 
corporate data and information for users required to fulﬁll their day-to-day activities. These users, 
from key constituencies, use all available network resources, both private and public, to gain access 
to all information in a timely fashion. The main advantage of the model being more responsive and 
efﬁcient instead of a model that protects information independent and isolated from the users of that 
information.
In general, a global network business spans all geographies, encouraging close relationships with 
customers, clients, partners, prospects, suppliers, and employees. 
How the Global Network Business Evolved
In this context, it is important to know the organization’s core competencies and start developing 
trusted business advisors and technology partnerships with companies that have the experience and 
share a similar long-term vision. Operating as a global network organization often leads to continuing 
changes in the use of the Internet that require coordination across multiple organizations. This effort 
is eased by shared goals and objectives. An increasingly common realization of the global 
networked business is the network virtual organization, in which cooperating organizations are 
connected by a common network infrastructure.
The models presented presume three underlying principles. They are customer or client focus, 
continuous standardization, and core versus context.
Customer Focus
Customer focus helps all participants in the activities that deﬁne the global network business or 
network virtual organization to look and move in the same direction. The improved responsiveness 
to changing requirements and increased satisfaction with provided goods and services that result 
from customer focus should provide an economic justiﬁcation for the network investments.

Top-Down Design Practices     11
Continuous Standardization
Continuous standardization works to use the network in ways that reduce the costs of providing 
goods and services through decreased service times and reduced redundancy. Standardizing the 
format allows increased direct data sharing, whereas standardizing internetworking technologies 
smoothes the ﬂow of data through the combined organizations by increasing the transparency of the 
underlying network.
Core Versus Context
Logically joining organizations allows each participant to focus on core activities, investing in the 
materials, tools, and technologies that allow effective transformation of physical and intellectual 
materials to goods and services in ways that improve the organization’s economic efﬁciency. The 
context in which each organization operates is provided by the interconnected mesh of cooperating 
suppliers and partners, each investing in its core activities.
Network Design and the Global Network Business 
Ultimately, the model used by an organization provides an environment for the execution of a plan. 
It is the model, the plan, and the execution that together provide the economic returns which justify 
the networking investment. The network design must be sensitive to all. The model is a starting 
point, subject to constant re-examination. No ﬁxed model is appropriate for every organization all 
the time. The beneﬁts derived from a model can be reduced, or enhanced, by unexpected external 
issues and events. In some organizations, information is the product, amplifying investments in 
information technology. Other organizations measure success in terms of revenue growth or cost 
containment. Capital investment can be seen as a foundation or an anchor that restricts mobility. 
Sensitivity to the view of an organization’s executives is critical in providing a satisfactory network 
design.
Top-Down Design Practices
For organizations to ensure long-term success, it is important to understand the contribution of 
networking, and more particularly internetworking, to the activities of the organization. Increased 
overall ﬁnancial and operational performance is enabled, and sustained, by the investment in 
internetworking.
It is critical to identify and measure an organization’s internetworking and Internet capabilities. This 
process should become an organization-wide pursuit directed by the highest executives. For many 
organizations, this process might require transforming the organization and the processes of the 
organization. The rest of this discussion addresses some strategies and tactics that you can employ 
to facilitate success. These design practices must originate from the very top of the organization with 
details based on the current situation, including the current network.

12     Chapter 1: Design Principles
Requirements for Top-Down Design Practices
One of the basic requirements for a successful implementation and strategic use of internetworks 
and the Internet is the engagement of the top executives, particularly the company’s CEO, during 
the design phase. Strategic use of the Internet to extend the organization’s reach outward to customers, 
clients, vendors, and partners cannot become a core part of an organization’s business philosophy 
until all the top executives assume an active leadership role in the process. Top executive support 
speeds the development of an organization’s Internet capabilities; when the CEO recognizes that the 
efﬁciencies enabled by the Internet are key to future growth and survival, cultural transitions and 
adoption rates are bound to happen faster.
It is good practice to perform a periodic executive review and to restate or revise an organization’s 
goals. Given the effort required to gather input from the various constituencies, and the value of 
executive time, annually is a reasonable frequency for this effort. For instance, the leadership team 
of Cisco selected “Leadership in Internet capabilities in all functions” as one of its top three goals. 
Every group throughout the company identiﬁed areas in which the Internet could impact its business 
area, deﬁned how it can become one of the best in those areas, and regularly reported progress on 
those plans. In other words, its Internet strategy was integrated with its business strategy, and it had 
to have measurable and reportable results. Getting executive support not only aids in the allocation 
of necessary resources, but it also sends the right message throughout the company. At the end of 
the day, the entire company needs to be involved in promoting network-enabled business initiatives.
Evaluation of Top-Down Design Practices
One of the steps is evaluating every activity in the organization. Look at how the organization is 
using the Internet and networking capabilities to transform the way business is done. In practice, 
have the IT team, perhaps assisted by outside consultants, visit with senior executives to discuss the 
Internet and networking strategy. In some organizations, this review will validate and reinforce 
existing practice. In other situations, the evaluation group might realize that although they already 
use the network for several functions, the company has no cohesive strategy for using its Internet 
and networking capabilities to better beneﬁt the organization.
Find a reference or benchmark company or organization outside of your own that is “best in class” 
for every function in the organization, whether it is customer care, e-commerce, e-learning, supply-
chain management, web foundation, or workforce optimization. Complete the following objectives 
during the design process, and keep them in the back of your mind during the course of the 
evaluation:
I
Recommendations for the best solutions delivering the greatest competitive edge for your 
organization
I
Prioritization for the deployment of those solutions to generate the maximum value and return 
on investment
I
Identiﬁcation and alignment of the resources required to put your networking plan in action

Top-Down Design Practices     13
Also during this phase, the organization needs to ﬁnd out how good (or bad) the different internal 
units are effectively using the Internet and networking capabilities of the organization. The efforts 
of the units in using these technologies as compared to other organizations can be categorized in one 
of four ways: lagging others, at market parity or average, leading others, or emerging. This evaluation 
should be validated by conversations with external peers performing equivalent functions when 
possible.
Deployment and Team Building for Top-Down Design Practices
When implementing new procedures and policies, you need to understand that organizations must 
embrace a new style and new set of rules all the way from the top to the bottom of the organization.
In general, the majority of projects that fail to deliver the expected beneﬁts do so because of cultural, 
organizational, and leadership gaps between the IT teams and the organization’s functional units. A 
leadership team that can bridge this gap will create a far more integrated and focused enterprise, 
increasing the probability of a desirable cycle of IT and business success.
For any projects, and more particularly for Internet and networking projects involving multiple 
departments within an organization, it is important to get participation from a broad base of people, 
from the technical experts to department managers and end users. These virtual teams must band 
together quickly and execute on tight schedules, requiring strong leadership and a sense of the 
common goals.
Creating the right team culture is not an easy task for most organizations, especially for organizations 
where the corporate history has been one of command and control. The necessary changes are not 
trivial, but the rewards that are a direct result of these changes will be exceptional.
The Final Word on Top-Down Design Practices
It deﬁnitely depends on the size of the organization, but consider creating a core team in charge to 
streamline the new processes. It will be its task to continually work with the departmental teams to 
develop new strategies based on best-practices experience throughout the organization and 
coordinate quarterly meetings with the senior leadership team.
Most organizations tend to compromise this important step, and after they have reaped the beneﬁts, 
they don’t identify or follow through on the next steps. This point is where the review process can 
help.
Set aside a good amount of time for every leader to determine the areas of redundancy and overlap. 
All members of the senior management team should participate in these review sessions. The review 
meetings provide good information for everyone regarding redundancies and overlooked opportu-
nities. One of the key things to remember: Creating added value is changing your processes as you 

14     Chapter 1: Design Principles
implement the new strategies. These changes are part of an ongoing process, providing a better 
leverage of the investments and also providing better coordination for the organization as a whole. 
Requirements and Constraints
As described in the introduction, network design is an exercise in meeting new and old requirements 
while also working with certain constraints. These constraints can be technological, social, political, 
or economic.
Technological Constraints
The impact of the technological developments used to implement the latest global network business 
models and network virtual organizations in conjunction with the changing needs of consumers and 
society in general is obvious. All these developments are the reason Internet trafﬁc doubles annually. 
CPU processing speed takes approximately 18 months to double. The difference in doubling periods 
and the inability of most organizations to augment capital equipment budgets to support these 
growth rates mean that CPU resources are a design constraint that you must address through 
network design and device conﬁguration. Typically, the computation (processing) limitations that 
apply to network design are associated with processing routing-table calculations, encrypting and 
decrypting secured packets, accounting, implementing incoming and outgoing access lists, or just 
forwarding packets.
Device memory size also plays a signiﬁcant role during the design phase, more or less for the same 
reasons.
Other resource considerations that can affect a network design include conﬁgurable buffer capacity, 
device port density, interface bandwidth, and backplane capacity constraints. In all cases, greater 
capacity increases the cost of the implementation. Another technological constraint involves 
ensuring that appropriate ventilation, air-conditioning, and other environmental requirements are 
met in the operations and laboratory facilities used to house the equipment.
Social Constraints
Manpower or labor in general is a clear concern in any network design. The more often a task must 
be executed (for instance, the amount of effort and skill required to connect a new user to the 
network or expand the capacity of the network infrastructure), the more the design should focus on 
making that particular task simple and efﬁcient to manage. Including network-management services 
in the design can mitigate some of the labor concerns through the automation of monitoring and 
reporting functions. This automation should reduce the quantity of highly skilled employees 
required for the ongoing operation of the network.

Design Activities, Tools, and Techniques     15
Political Constraints
Political concerns could include the compulsory use of standards and installed applications that are 
difﬁcult to understand, implement, and use. 
Some organizations might have a single vendor pre-arranged partnership agreement, whereas other 
team members desire a multivendor type of environment.
Economic Constraints
Economic constraints play a major role for all network designers. Doing “more with less” is a 
common requirement, partially enabled by advances in semiconductor technology. Even when the 
restatement “achieving the best possible service at the lowest possible cost” is acceptable, there are 
design consequences. Common areas of design compromise for minimizing network acquisition 
and operations costs include WAN bandwidth, quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, availability, 
security, and manageability. Ultimately, the network designer satisﬁes selected requirements to 
maximize the beneﬁts from the network-built subject constraints of both cost and time. Other 
requirements with a lower priority, or less visibility, get deferred to later implementation phases or 
canceled.
Return on Investment (ROI)
A strategic part of the network design process is a tracking mechanism to measure the proﬁt for a 
speciﬁc investment. A company’s management team uses this simple tool as a ﬁnancial metric to 
make business investment decisions and to measure the company’s performance over time.
Return on Investment (ROI) is often calculated and deﬁned in percentage terms and results in the 
return a customer can expect from the investment made. ROI is calculated by dividing the proﬁt 
(return) by the total investment cost. Sometimes, the ROI is also speciﬁed as a ratio or break-even 
number. The latter has a time ratio in the calculation and results in the exact timeframe until the 
investment is returned.
Most customers in today’s business environment try to understand or ask for a value justiﬁcation; 
this is where the ROI calculation plays a signiﬁcant role.
Design Activities, Tools, and Techniques
During the network-design process, there might be tools available to facilitate some of the activities. 
Some of the activities supported by tools include network auditing, trafﬁc analysis, and network 
simulation. The choice of tools is very much determined by the value of the network investment and 
the consequences of network failure. This section discusses some of the tools and techniques used 
in today’s network-design process for auditing networks and analyzing and simulating network 
trafﬁc. 

16     Chapter 1: Design Principles
Having tools available to support every stage of the design process reduces risk (for instance, 
new equipment in the network), increases understanding (how certain components work in your 
environment), and improves responsiveness to design opportunities (getting technical analysis and 
business cases quickly).
Auditing an Existing Network
Network audit tools will help you generate speciﬁc reports on certain parts of your network and 
analyze how these segments of the network are performing. The network audit process should 
provide detailed recommendations to address the challenges, opportunities, and problems identiﬁed 
in the audit. The audit will also help the network-engineering team proactively identify and resolve 
potential network troubles before major problems are encountered. 
Following is a list of reports that are often generated as part of a network audit:
I
Performance reports
I
Conﬁguration reports
I
Software reports
I
Hardware reports
In general, a network audit will identify speciﬁc opportunities to improve the network utilization, 
availability, and stability, resulting in a reduced operation cost and a maximum return on the 
investment in the network infrastructure.
Analyzing Network Trafﬁc
Network trafﬁc analysis collects and analyzes data, which allows the network designer to balance 
the network load, troubleshoot and resolve network problems, optimize network performance, and, 
last but not least, plan future network growth. Trafﬁc analysis is often performed as part of a network 
audit to generate performance reports.
The analysis tools help engineers and network designers better understand trafﬁc patterns in the 
network. There are many analysis-tool suites on the market. Some provide only basic calculations. 
Others give extensive detail, including a complex analysis of trafﬁc patterns, capacity availability, 
delay, and operational stability. Some tools allow the designer to re-run the analysis as the design is 
developed. Trafﬁc analysis conducted during deployment allows timely adjustment of the design 
based on issues encountered at various locations or times.

Design Activities, Tools, and Techniques     17
Simulating Network Trafﬁc
Network simulation has at least two distinct realizations. The ﬁrst models the network using 
software to emulate the trafﬁc sources and sinks, network devices, and the links that connect them. 
By varying model parameters, the designer can approximate the impact of more or less trafﬁc 
demand or network resources. Although simulation software is expensive, for a large network it 
is far less expensive than building a ﬂawed design. The second kind of simulation uses special 
hardware and software to generate trafﬁc for injection into a live network for subsequent trafﬁc 
analysis.
This testing activity is useful for validating and adequately testing QoS, latency, adaptive protocols, 
multicasting, and so on.
Trafﬁc generation is also appropriate to estimate how the existing network will respond as you add 
new applications and services. Dynamic bandwidth utilization and latency are relatively difﬁcult to 
estimate as compared to simple trafﬁc delivery. Loss is relatively obvious. You can use adaptive 
protocols and applications with trafﬁc generators to validate the expected behaviors.
A ﬁnal use of trafﬁc generation is testing multicast delivery. A large, complex test environment 
requires tools to ensure reasonable test coverage.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
Organizations, and their respective leadership teams, are beginning to realize how their networks 
can deliver process efﬁciencies that impact revenue, cost, and schedule.
Therefore, these organizations increasingly focus on network-design principles, including the 
recommended steps of internetworking design and organizational network policies and procedures. 
Organizations implementing a global network business model using top-down design concepts must 
make sure that they consider and manage all the requirements and constraints.
You can use a set of activities, techniques, and tools in today’s network-design process.
Global Network Business Model
In general, a global network business spans all geographies, encouraging close relationships with 
customers, clients, partners, prospects, suppliers, and employees. 
Top-Down Design
When implementing new procedures and policies, it is important that organizations embrace a new 
style and new set of rules for leadership and management all the way down from the top to the 
bottom of the organization.
Requirements and Constraints
Network design is an exercise in meeting new and old requirements while also working with certain 
constraints. These constraints can be technological, social, political, or economic.
Network-Design Tools
During the network-design process, you have a set of tools to facilitate some of the work. Some of 
the tools and techniques used in today’s network-design process are network audits, network trafﬁc 
analysis, and network simulation.

Network Design Methodology
Design methodology is a critical process to network directors, administrators, consultants, 
and architects. Many organizations have grown their in-house expertise to include network 
designers because of the frequency of network changes. The growing role of the network as 
a business enabler has forced rapid and dynamic changes for both the network and the IT 
organization. This chapter delivers a comprehensive, yet simple, design methodology based 
on the extensive experience of Cisco.

Design Methodology     25
Foundation Topics
In this section, you learn a design methodology that helps the network designer deﬁne the network’s 
technical and business requirements and work through all phases of the technology lifecycle of 
planning, design, implementation, operation, and optimization (PDIOO). With the importance of 
organizational network policies and procedure, as discussed in Chapter 1, “Design Principles,” this 
chapter discusses documenting the gathered information and relevant ﬁndings.
Design Methodology
As network expectations have changed, so have design principles. Enterprises no longer rely on a 
single vendor, technology, or protocol. The design strategy has changed dramatically to include 
security and scalability as primary criteria. Security is having a large impact on network design. 
Placing access servers and WAN routers is more complex and deliberate. 
Large, ﬂat, bridged networks with thousands of users have almost disappeared. Networks are 
subnetted to manageable sizes to limit broadcast domains and manage functional workgroups. 
Advances in microprocessor technology have allowed the development of multilayer switches that 
can perform routing and other high-level network functions at speeds formerly only attainable with 
large switched networks.
Redesigned networks transport only IP packets; instead of bridging or routing non-IP packets, net-
works encapsulate these protocols into IP before the router transmits them. In a LAN, a common 
design technique is to place all local-area transport (LAT) or Systems Network Architecture (SNA) 
devices on one VLAN so bridged trafﬁc is not required.
There is greater redundancy in network designs; since September 11, business continuity has 
become a priority. New levels of redundancy are required, and disaster recovery is no longer 
optional. Redundancy is taking many forms, including separate power sources, multiple WAN 
carriers, alternate cable routes, and redundant hardware. Network connectivity and services are crit-
ical components of enterprise operations. The cost of downtime is increasing at a phenomenal rate. 
Enterprises are no longer locked into using a single vendor, technology, or protocol; many technol-
ogies have standardized, but it is still not a trivial factor to design a network. Assessing the design 
criteria enables you to understand the network and what it was meant to do. Network designs must 
easily adapt to implement the next generation of technology. Many network designers are planning 
for IP telephony; these network-design plans are not for new networks but are improvements on 
existing ones. Properly planning networks based on sound architecture makes necessary network 
redesigns easier.

26     Chapter 2: Network Design Methodology
PDIOO Stages of the Network 
Design is just one component of a network lifecycle. Planning, design, implementation, operation, 
and optimization (PDIOO) are the different stages of the network lifecycle. Each stage builds on its 
predecessor, developing a sound network that maintains its effectiveness through changing business 
needs. You can apply the PDIOO methodology to all technologies. During this PDIOO process, you 
deﬁne key deliverables and associated actions, with a direct correlation to the added value and 
beneﬁt for the client’s network. For example, understanding business goals, usage characteristics, 
and network requirements helps you avoid unnecessary upgrades and network redesigns, reducing 
time for introducing new services in the network. Discussions in this chapter revolve around these 
ﬁve main stages.
Planning
The role of the network is undergoing constant change due to the changing demands on business 
and changes in network products and technologies. Changes to the network, whether small or large, 
reﬂect the PDIOO lifecycle. As an example, imagine a typical small network consisting of 200 users 
in the healthcare market. This company plans to double its revenue by adding ﬁve remote ofﬁces. 
Now, its original network becomes a hub site to these remote ofﬁces. It would be unmanageable, 
and potentially costly, to have Internet access at each of these remote ofﬁces, so the hub site is the 
central point of Internet access.
This change to the network begins with planning. At this stage, it is important to deﬁne the 
following:
I
Business requirements and strategy
I
Project-success criteria
I
Network architecture
The following is a list of architectural inquiries you must answer to deﬁne the strategy:
I
Determine performance requirements for the network. How will the network ensure 
performance as the network scales?
I
Determine availability requirements. How much network redundancy is required? What are the 
critical components of the network? 
I
How will network management be deployed throughout the network? What components need 
out-of-band management? How will the IT resources manage multiple network-down 
situations?
I
What is the state of the current network? 

Design     27
This list is just a sample of the types of questions you can encounter during the network-planning 
stage. The responses to these questions are not products or conﬁgurations: They are strategies. 
Planning is a stage where you can test the logic of your future design and determine whether there 
are any ﬂaws. Planning helps you avoid replicating a logical mistake in a network design that you 
would use as a template across ﬁve locations. 
Design Assessment
When planning for changes to an existing network, it is critical to understand the state of the existing 
network. This type of assessment provides a starting point. It also provides you with an understand-
ing of how the network and the user community operate together. Not taking the user community 
into account can become a major problem during the implementation.
Therefore, it is critical to identify and measure your Internet and networking capabilities, which 
should become a company-wide process. This approach is a top-down approach to network design. 
Top-down means that you begin with abstract concepts and application requirements ﬁrst before 
identifying technologies to use. The abstract concepts are the business requirements, the network 
architecture, and then the network design. The process is often iterative because the design changes 
as you uncover more information about the needs of the network. Note that the results of each stage 
of the PDIOO network lifecycle affect the network design. 
Design
After completing the planning stage, you have enough information to develop a network design. If 
a network is already in place, use this phase to review and validate it. At this stage, you choose prod-
ucts, protocols, and features based on criteria deﬁned in the planning stage. You develop network 
diagrams to illustrate what changes will occur in the network to achieve the desired results. The 
more detailed the network diagram and plan, the better you can anticipate the challenges during the 
implementation.
NOTE
In addition to the PDIOO lifecycle, Cisco recommends an architecture for building 
complex networks using structured design practices. This functional model provides central man-
agement and a site backbone, or core, which offers transport services to hierarchies of distribution 
and access modules that support user connectivity, servers, and WAN connectivity to other sites, 
organizations, and individuals. This model is also the basis of the Security Architecture for Enter-
prise (SAFE) blueprint, which evolved from the Cisco Architecture for Voice, Video, and Inte-
grated Data (AVVID).

28     Chapter 2: Network Design Methodology
Following a structured design enables you to predict trafﬁc behavior, routing paths, and capacity 
requirements. It is recommended that the structured network design begins with the outermost 
layers, such as the access and the applications, and then move inward to distribution and core. 
Implement, Operate, and Optimize
The implementation stage provides detailed customized deliverables to help avoid risks, meet 
expectations, and so on. The operate and optimization phase, also known as the operational-support 
phase, is designed to protect your network investment and help your staff prevent problems, 
maximize system utility, and accelerate problem resolution. The following sections describe the 
steps in more detail.
Implementation
A sound implementation plan ensures smooth deployment, even when issues arise. Communicating 
the implementation plan to all stakeholders provides you with an opportunity to assess the viability 
of the plan. It is better to ﬁnd mistakes on the drawing board than during the implementation. Good 
processes such as change control can effectively handle issues that occur during the deployment. In 
addition, change control provides ﬂexibility because it is impossible to plan for every contingency, 
especially if the implementation has a long duration.
Operability and Support Maintenance
Eventually, you have to support and ensure the operability of what you build. Network-management 
strategy is equally important as the network design, and you must address it in the planning and 
design stage. There is no doubt that networks are getting larger and more complex, but so are the 
support requirements for the network. You can resolve issues with resource constraints and 
increased support hours, in part, with a well-planned network-management solution. Remember, 
after the excitement and newness of the network installation has worn off, you are still left with a 
network that you have to manage.
Assigning Ownership of Network Management
All organizations, unless they completely outsource all aspects of the network, have some level of 
ownership of network management. With the growing demands on network managers, they must 
make an assessment. Is it realistic and cost-effective to develop network-management staff and 
tools in-house to meet the service expectations? How long can the current support provided by the 
existing network-management solution remain viable? What changes must you make to ensure its 
viability? What is your network-management solution’s total cost of ownership? You must explore 
this topic in the process of deciding who owns the network-management solution in-house.

Network Documentation     29
Outsourcing Network Management with MSPs
Network management has traditionally been the responsibility of the network managers, engineers, 
and operators. If an organization outsourced management, engineering, and operations, it also 
outsourced network management. But recent years have seen the rise of managed service providers 
(MSPs), companies that monitor the network but do not take ownership of the conﬁguration and 
troubleshooting of the network.
Typical MSPs offer basic fault management, monitoring the up/down status of key network devices 
as determined by the customer. When a device goes down, the MSP pages or calls a designated cus-
tomer contact who is responsible for resolution. It is also common for MSPs to offer performance-
management capabilities, monitoring bandwidth usage on WAN links. The MSP usually monitors 
the network over an encrypted Internet session.
MSPs solve a common problem with implementing a network-management system—how to pay for 
the software, systems, and services necessary for a network-management system, which, depending 
on the size and needs of the organization, can vary from $10,000 to more than $1,000,000. With an 
MSP, the organization pays a monthly fee based on the number of monitored devices.
MSPs offer the advantage of providing monitoring services 24-by-7, often exceeding the customer 
requirements, at a reduced implementation price. Monthly payments to the MSP can eventually 
exceed the cost of building an owned management system. 
MSPs might not be able to provide all the services that the customer requires. For example, the MSP 
might not be able to provide reports according to the customer’s standards. Remember, you are 
using the MSP services for your purposes, but they might not be an exact match to your needs.
Optimization
The last step in the PDIOO process is the optimization of the network. A sound design still requires 
optimization and “tweaking” to gain its full potential. The optimization of the network can be as 
simple as hardening servers against security threats or adding quality of service (QoS) to the net-
work for latency-sensitive trafﬁc. Optimization can even lead to a redesign of the network, so the 
cycle would begin again.
Network Documentation
After completing a design, the next step is to document it so that you can properly communicate 
your solution. The documentation can be in the form of a response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) 

30     Chapter 2: Network Design Methodology
or a design document, also referred to as a proposal. The following are the minimum recommended 
sections of the design document, all of which are described in detail in the sections that follow:
I
Executive summary
I
Design requirements
I
Design solution
I
Summary and appendixes
Executive Summary
The ﬁrst section is an executive summary, which is typically one page in length. The executive sum-
mary describes the network requirements and how the proposed design meets those requirements. 
The audience for the executive summary is the decision makers for the project. The following is a 
list of suggested topics:
I
State the goals of the project and how it relates to the business needs.
I
Describe how your solution addresses these business needs. Outline the network-design 
strategy. 
I
Describe the implementation concerns such as integration issues, training, support, and 
transition issues. 
I
Outline the beneﬁts of the solution.
It is important that you write the executive summary clearly and concisely. Remember that the 
audience needs to understand the project based on this one- or two-page description.
Design Requirements
This section describes the results of investigating the organization’s business and technical needs. 
Some of the methods for understanding the design requirements can include characterizing the 
existing network and the logical network requirements, such as performance, scalability, capacity, 
security, and trafﬁc needs. It is helpful in this section to organize the design requirements to be easily 
understandable. Remember to refer back to the business needs as appropriate.
Design Solution
Present the recommended solution in this section based on the priority of the organization. This 
section should include a network diagram of the proposed solution. The network diagram should 
contain addressing and naming conventions. Also included are listings of the hardware and software 
recommendations for the LAN and WAN and the recommended protocols for routing and applica-
tion. Finally, with any implementation, you should write a section addressing how the network will 
be managed after it is installed.

helps the customers visualize the project with which you are familiar.
Network Prototype
A complex network design can be a ﬁnancial drain and a resource drain on an organization. It is 
necessary to demonstrate that the design meets the project requirements. A network prototype can 
provide this “trial run” at a minimal cost but with the capability to demonstrate almost all the 
functionality of the network, resulting in a prototype.
A prototype is a complex and full trial run of the network design used to prove that the design 
works. A prototype is usually a large-scale, fully functional form of a new design that you can use 
to prove a large implementation. It is necessary to decide whether the need to prove the design 
justiﬁes the cost of setting up a prototype, and Table 2-2 summarizes the criteria for choosing the 
prototype.

Creating a Prototype
After you determine the testing needs, you must perform the appropriate steps for creating a 
prototype. Table 2-3 lists the steps for creating a prototype.
Table 2-3
Steps for Creating a Prototype 
Steps
Description
Step 1: Review the requirements.
Determine the major goals.
Outline the proof required to demonstrate that your design works.
Determine possible problem areas that might affect your design.
Step 2: Determine the extent of the 
prototype.
Determine how much of the design must be built into a prototype 
to be effective.
Identify the tools you can use to simplify the prototype.
Step 3: Understand alternative 
proposals.
Work with others to identify the products and designs in 
alternative proposals.
If information is not available, speculate on what competing 
proposals might use. 
Research information on alternative products by referencing 
websites, industry articles, and evaluations.
Step 4: Develop a test plan.
Draw a network diagram.
List tools for the test.
List the plan scheduling, resources, and milestones.
Prepare the demonstrations.
Determine how each test will prove that the design meets the 
requirements.
Determine how each test will show that the alternative products 
provide an inferior solution.

34     Chapter 2: Network Design Methodology
The sections that follow describe in detail all the steps outlined in Table 2-3.
Step 1: Reviewing the Requirements
Having a clear goal for building your prototype is essential. In fact, you should create the prototype 
design using the same approach you used to determine requirements for the original design. 
Step 5: Purchase and prepare 
equipment.
You must acquire and prepare some or all of the following 
equipment:
Network-simulation tools
Protocol analyzers
Industry tests
Network hardware and software
Routers
Switches
Network-management tools
End-system hardware and software
Application servers
File servers
Step 6: Practice.
Practice your demonstration to include the necessary elements 
from the previous step.
Step 7: Conduct ﬁnal tests and 
demonstrations.
Test your conﬁguration using the following tools:
Cisco IOS Software commands
Protocol analyzers
Simulation tools
Table 2-3
Steps for Creating a Prototype (Continued)
Steps
Description

Network Prototype     35
Begin by doing the following:
I
List the major goals.
I
Identify the requirements for performance, security, capacity, and scalability.
I
Consider other requirements such as return-on-investment (ROI) issues, management of the 
new network, equipment reuse, and the cost of implementing the prototype test.
I
Determine what speciﬁc advantages you can illustrate with the prototype.
Plan the ideas you illustrate to ensure that the prototype is complete and that it serves as a useful 
vehicle to demonstrate these points.
Just as it is important to list the good ideas, you also want to be ready for any problems or issues 
that might negatively affect the success of the project. Take the time to list the cons to the prototype 
so that you are ready to address them as well. 
Step 2: Determining the Extent of the Prototype
Creating the right-size prototype is critical. You must determine how much of the design you should 
include in the prototype to meet the test expectations. The scope of your prototype is a factor 
that you must determine before work can begin. The cost and the purpose of the prototype often 
determine the size of the demonstration. For example, if one of the primary concerns is time, you 
might focus your effort on a speciﬁc problem. If it is necessary to roll out the design in multiple 
locations, it might be possible to implement a full prototype in one of the organization’s many 
locations.
When proving the effectiveness of your design, you can use tools and investigative services to 
simplify the development of the prototype by simulating some of the equipment and their effect 
on the network. 
These simulations generally remove the need to purchase, install, and conﬁgure actual equipment 
to make the task of creating the prototype less costly.
TIP
Remember that the network goals are the deciding factor in determining how much of the 
network design you should implement to prove its value.
TIP
You can use a network analyzer to simulate trafﬁc. It also works as a tool to prove the 
effectiveness of the network design. The Network General’s Sniffer is one of several network 
analyzers.

36     Chapter 2: Network Design Methodology
Competing products sometimes endure third-party industry tests. You can use these tests and their 
results to prove your design without building a test yourself. An example of one of these tests is the 
Strategic Networks Consulting, Inc. (SNCI) switch test, available from the SNCI website. It per-
formed this test on Cisco’s Catalyst 5000 switches and Cabletron’s MMAC-Plus switches. Go to the 
SNCI website at http://www.zdnet.com/zdtag/snci/ to review the test and other similar comparisons. 
Step 3: Understanding Alternative Proposals
For a large design that requires a prototype, there are probably several competing design alterna-
tives. It is important to plan this particular prototype to highlight the advantages that your design 
can offer above the competition. Working with the account manager and sales team can help you 
ﬁnd the alternative proposals. Taking the time to gather as much information on other proposals is 
always a good way to double-check your own design and to make sure that you did not miss a point. 
If it is not possible to get information on the alternatives, make some assumptions on what might be 
proposed to meet the project requirements by referencing websites or product descriptions. You can 
make a comparison list of features based on the requirements or draw up a list of pros and cons about 
the alternatives. Then, use this information to build your strategy.
Step 4: Developing a Test Plan
After you prepare to create the prototype, the next step is to create the test plan to use on the proto-
type. The best tool available to a designer is a topology map of the prototype test network. You can 
use this one diagram to view the entire network, and it can be the single most important document 
of a prototype. On this diagram, you can include major conﬁguration parameters, such as network 
speeds, topology information, WAN line speeds, and descriptions of speciﬁc network devices, such 
as ﬁrewalls.
A topology map of the test environment proves invaluable. The prototype topology map can include 
a list of simulation tools, Cisco hardware and software, and non-Cisco hardware and software you 
need for the prototype. Some of the non-Cisco hardware you might want to use includes cables, 
modems, null modems, WAN connections, Internet access, workstations, servers, design-simulation 
tools, telephone-equipment simulators, and so on. 
When compiling a list of the resources you need, it is important also to list and plan the tests that 
you will perform on the prototype network. The test plan should reﬂect the goals you decided upon 
when you created the design for the prototype: Remember that you designed these goals to meet the 
project needs.

Network Prototype     37
Demonstration
Performing a demonstration might be complicated and might require the involvement of multiple 
people to ensure its success. If you require help from coworkers or collaboration from others, 
remember to request the help with ample time to coordinate your resources. To make sure that 
everyone understands what to do for the test, be sure to develop and review a script.
Table 2-4 shows a table included in a script that maps out the roles and responsibilities of the people 
involved in the presentation. If you clearly deﬁne this type of information, people are better prepared 
to contribute to the success of the presentation.
Test the script ahead of time at a lab. Preparation only reinforces the testing, which in turn shows 
that your team is coordinated and professional and also might point out any unforeseen problems 
that you must resolve before you present the ﬁnal product 
Finally, the test should highlight the strengths of the design and point out how the alternatives might 
not prove as useful. Remember to review the test to avoid issues that might arise later during the 
demonstration.

38     Chapter 2: Network Design Methodology
Step 5: Purchasing and Preparing Equipment
Remember that it is important to prepare for the prototype demonstration well in advance so that 
you can purchase and conﬁgure the equipment with ample time. Because equipment purchases can 
be delayed or other unforeseen problems can arise, you should gather and conﬁgure the equipment 
as soon as you compile a list. This list would include the following:
I
Network-simulation tools 
I
Network hardware and software 
I
End-system hardware and software
Remember to prepare an inventory sheet to help you track the products as they arrive. It’s also 
important to stage some of the equipment with basic testing. Staging is a method of setting up the 
equipment for basic conﬁguration and testing the hardware. It is also a good time to develop an 
inventory to help you sort your equipment. 
Step 6: Practicing
Performing the demonstration is a complex task. It is important to practice with the members of your 
team to coordinate your presentation; it is especially important if you are going to demonstrate the 
equipment. You want to make sure that your demonstration does not have any surprises that would 
adversely affect your success. Make sure that you give yourself ample time to practice several times.
Step 7: Conducting Final Tests and Demonstrations
During the ﬁnal step, you must present the prototype design for usability testing. Some common 
basic tools that can make demonstrations more effective are
I
Protocol analyzers
I
Simulation tools
I
Cisco IOS commands
An insightful design methodology helps the network designer deﬁne the network’s technical 
and business requirements and work through all phases of the technology lifecycle of PDIOO. 
Documenting the gathered information is critical, and a complex network design might require 
demonstrating that the design meets the project requirements using a network prototype.

Foundation Summary     39
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should, at a minimum, know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before taking the exam.
PDIOO
The network lifecycle is a simple process of planning, designing, implementing, operating, and 
optimizing. Whether you face a simple design change or a new network, the ﬁve steps are applicable. 
If you begin with proper planning, you can ensure a smoother implementation. 
Each stage of the lifecycle, although described in one word, represents a complex grouping of tasks. 
Those tasks change depending on the project at hand. However, creating clear and realistic objec-
tives for each stage is the key to developing subsequent tasks. Treat each stage as if it were its own 
project, with the same level of concentration and completeness.
Network Documentation
After completing a network design, you must present it in a manner that is concise and accurate. 
Cisco recommends that the network documentation have the following ﬁve components:
I
Executive summary
I
Design requirements
I
Design solution
I
Summary
I
Appendix
The documentation is the “gift wrapping” on your project, but remember that it leaves an impression 
and you should not take it lightly.

48     Chapter 3: Network Structure Models
Foundation Topics
With the complexities of network design, the CCDA needs to understand network models used to 
simplify the design process. The hierarchical network model was one of the ﬁrst Cisco models that 
divided the network into core, distribution, and access layers.
The Enterprise Composite Network model is a model that provides a functional modular approach 
to network design. In addition to a hierarchy, modules organize server farms, network management, 
and the Enterprise Edge. Chapters that follow focus on the technologies and solutions in each of 
these modules.
Hierarchical Network Models
Hierarchical models enable you to design internetworks that use specialization of function com-
bined with an hierarchical organization. Such a design simpliﬁes the tasks required to build a 
network that meets current requirements and can grow to meet future requirements. Hierarchical 
models use layers to simplify the tasks for internetworking. Each layer can focus on speciﬁc func-
tions, allowing you to choose the right systems and features for each layer. Hierarchical models 
apply to both LAN and WAN design.
Beneﬁts of the Hierarchical Model
The beneﬁts of using hierarchical models for your network design include the following:
I
Cost savings
I
Ease of understanding
I
Modular network growth
I
Improved fault isolation
After adopting hierarchical design models, many organizations report cost savings because they are 
no longer trying to do everything in one routing or switching platform. The modular nature of the 
model enables appropriate use of bandwidth within each layer of the hierarchy, reducing the 
provisioning of bandwidth in advance of actual need.

Hierarchical Network Models     49
Keeping each design element simple and functionally focused facilitates ease of understanding, which 
helps control training and staff costs. You can distribute network-monitoring and management-
reporting systems to the different layers of modular network architectures, which also helps control 
management costs.
Hierarchical design facilitates changes. In a network design, modularity lets you create design ele-
ments that you can replicate as the network grows. As each element in the network design requires 
change, the cost and complexity of making the upgrade is contained to a small subset of the overall 
network. In large, ﬂat network architectures, changes tend to impact a large number of systems. 
Limited mesh topologies within a layer or component, such as the campus core or backbone con-
necting central sites, retain value even in the hierarchical design models.
Structuring the network into small, easy-to-understand elements improves fault isolation. Network 
managers can easily understand the transition points in the network, which helps identify failure 
points.
Today’s fast-converging protocols were designed for hierarchical topologies. To control the impact 
of routing-protocol processing and bandwidth consumption, you must use modular hierarchical 
topologies with protocols designed with these controls in mind, such as Open Shortest Path First 
(OSPF). 
Hierarchical network design facilitates route summarization. Route summarization reduces the 
routing-protocol overhead on links in the network and reduces routing-protocol processing within 
the routers.
Hierarchical Network Design
As Figure 3-1 illustrates, a traditional hierarchical LAN design has three layers:
I
The core layer provides fast transport between distribution sites within the enterprise campus.
I
The distribution layer provides policy-based connectivity.
I
The access layer provides workgroup and user access to the network.
Each layer provides necessary functionality to the enterprise campus network. You do not need to 
implement the layers as distinct physical entities. You can implement each layer in one or more 
devices or as cooperating interface components sharing a common chassis. Smaller networks can 
“collapse” multiple layers to a single device with only an implied hierarchy. Maintaining an explicit 
awareness of hierarchy is useful as the network grows.

50     Chapter 3: Network Structure Models
Figure 3-1
A Hierarchical Network Design Has Three Layers: Core, Distribution, and Access
Core Layer
The core layer is the high-speed switching backbone of the network, which is crucial to corporate 
communications. The core layer should have the following characteristics:
I
Fast transport
I
High reliability
I
Redundancy
I
Fault tolerance
I
Quick adaptation (adapt to changes quickly)
I
Low latency and good manageability
I
Avoidance of slow packet manipulation caused by ﬁlters or other processes
I
Limited and consistent diameter
When a network uses routers, the number of router hops from edge to edge is called the diameter. 
As noted, it is considered good practice to design for a consistent diameter within a hierarchical 
network. The trip from any end station to another end station across the backbone should have the

same number of hops. The distance from any end station to a server on the backbone should also be 
consistent.
Limiting the diameter of the internetwork provides predictable performance and ease of trouble-
shooting. You can add distribution layer routers and client LANs to the hierarchical model without 
increasing the diameter of the core layer. Use of a block implementation isolates existing end sta-
tions from most effects of network growth. 
Distribution Layer
The distribution layer of the network is the isolation point between the access and core layers of 
the network. The distribution layer can have many roles, including implementing the following 
functions:
I
Policy (for example, ensuring that trafﬁc sent from a particular network is forwarded out one 
interface while all other trafﬁc is forwarded out another interface)
I
Security ﬁltering
I
Address or area aggregation or summarization
I
Departmental or workgroup access
I
Broadcast or multicast domain deﬁnition
I
Routing between virtual LANs (VLANs)
I
Media translations (for example, between Ethernet and Token Ring)
I
Redistribution between routing domains (for example, between two different routing protocols)
I
Demarcation between static and dynamic routing protocols
You can use several Cisco IOS Software features to implement policy at the distribution layer, 
including the following:
I
Filtering by source or destination address
I
Filtering on input or output ports
I
Hiding internal network numbers by route ﬁltering
I
Static routing
I
Quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms (for example, ensuring that all devices along a path can 
accommodate the requested parameters)
The distribution layer provides aggregation of routes providing route summarization to the core. In 
the campus LANs, the distribution layer provides routing between VLANs that also apply security 
and QoS policies.

52     Chapter 3: Network Structure Models
Access Layer
The access layer provides user access to local segments on the network. The access layer is charac-
terized by switched- and shared-bandwidth LAN segments in a campus environment. Microsegmen-
tation using LAN switches provides high bandwidth to workgroups by reducing collision domains 
on Ethernet segments and reducing the number of stations capturing the token on Token Ring LANs. 
Some functions of the access layer include the following:
I
High availability
I
Port security
I
Rate limiting
I
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) inspection
I
Virtual access lists
I
Trust classiﬁcation
You implement high-availability models at the access layer. The section “Network Availability” 
later in this chapter covers availability models. The LAN switch in the access layer can control 
access to the port and limit the rate at which trafﬁc is sent to and from the port. You can implement 
access by identifying the MAC address using ARP, trusting the host, and using access lists.
Other chapters of this book cover the other functions in the list.
For small ofﬁce/home ofﬁce (SOHO) environments, the entire hierarchy collapses to interfaces on 
a single device. Remote access to the central corporate network is through traditional WAN technol-
ogies such as ISDN, Frame Relay, and leased lines. You can implement features such as dial-on-
demand routing (DDR) and static routing to control costs. Remote access can include virtual private 
network (VPN) technology.
Hierarchical Model Examples
You can implement the hierarchical model by using either routers or switches. Figure 3-2 is an 
example of a switched hierarchical design. In this design, the core provides high-speed transport and 
the routing functionality resides in the distribution layer. Figure 3-3 shows examples of a routed 
hierarchical design. In this design, the core uses multilayer switches to offer line-speed transport 
with Layer 3 (routing) functionality.

Enterprise Composite Network Model
The Cisco Enterprise Composite Network model facilitates the design of larger, more scalable 
networks. As networks become more sophisticated, it is necessary to use a more modular approach 
to design than just WAN and LAN core, distribution, and access layers. The model divides the 
network into functional components, functional areas containing network modules. It maintains the 
concept of distribution and access components connecting users, WAN services, and server farms 
through a high-speed campus backbone. The modular approach in design should be a guide to the 
network architect. In smaller networks, the layers can collapse into a single layer, even a single 
device, but the functions remain. The Enterprise Composite Network model divides the network 
into three major functional components:
I
Enterprise Campus
I
Enterprise Edge
I
SP Edge
Figure 3-4 shows the Enterprise Composite Network model. The Enterprise Campus functional 
component consists of the campus infrastructure with server farms and network management. An 
edge-distribution module provides distribution from the campus infrastructure to the Enterprise 
Edge. The Enterprise Edge consists of the Internet, VPN, and WAN modules that connect the 
enterprise with the SP’s facilities. The SP Edge provides Internet, PSTN, and WAN services.

Enterprise Composite Network Model     55
In brief, the enterprise infrastructure consists of core, distribution, and access layers. The network-
management servers reside in the campus infrastructure but have tie-ins into all the components in 
the enterprise network for monitoring and management.
The Enterprise Edge connects to the edge-distribution module of the enterprise campus. In small and 
medium sites, the edge distribution can collapse into the campus-backbone component. It provides 
connectivity to outbound services that are further described in later sections. And the server-farms 
module provides high-availability network service for campus servers.
Enterprise Campus Modules
The Enterprise Campus consists of the following modules:
I
Enterprise infrastructure
I
Edge distribution
I
Server farms
I
Network management
Figure 3-5 shows the enterprise-campus model. The campus infrastructure consists of the core, 
building distribution, and access layers. The server farm or data center provides high-speed access 
and high availability (redundancy) to the servers. The CM is located in the server farm for IP tele-
phony networks.
An enterprise-campus infrastructure can apply to small, medium, and large locations. In most 
instances, large campus locations have a three-tier design with a wiring-closet component (building-
access layer), a building-distribution layer, and a campus-core layer. Small campus locations likely 
have a two-tier design with a wiring-closet component (Ethernet access layer) and a backbone core 
(collapsed core and distribution layers). It is also possible to conﬁgure distribution functions in a 
multilayer building-access device to maintain the focus of the campus backbone on fast transport. 
Medium-sized campus network designs sometimes use a three-tier implementation or a two-tier 
implementation, depending on the number of ports, service requirements, manageability, 
performance, and availability required.
Figure 3-6 shows an example of a campus-wide design. Workgroup switches in the building-access 
layer provide access to the network. Ports are assigned a VLAN for access. Trunking protocols 
connect building access, building distribution, and campus backbone switches. Multilayer switches 
and servers use FastEtherchannel or Gigabit Ethernet media. Chapter 4, “LAN Design,” covers LAN 
designs in more detail.
TIP
LAN environments also refer to the enterprise infrastructure as the campus backbone, 
building distribution, and building access layers. The functions are similar to those of the core, 
distribution, and access layers.

Enterprise Edge Modules
The Enterprise Edge consists of the following modules:
I
E-commerce networks and servers
I
Internet connectivity
I
VPN and remote access
I
Classic WAN
E-Commerce Module
The e-commerce module provides highly available networks for business services. It uses the high-
availability designs of the server-farm module with the Internet connectivity of the Internet module. 
Design techniques are the same as those described for these modules. 
Internet Module
Several models connect the enterprise to the Internet. The simplest form is to have a single circuit 
between the enterprise and the SP, as shown in Figure 3-7. The drawback is that you have no 
redundancy or failover if the circuit fails.
Figure 3-7
Simple Internet Connection
You can use multihoming solutions to provide redundancy or failover for Internet service. Figure 
3-8 shows several Internet multihoming options. The four options follow:
I
Option 1: Single router, dual links to one Internet service provider (ISP)

Option 1 provides link redundancy but does not provide ISP and local router redundancy. Option 2 
provides link and ISP redundancy but does not provide redundancy for a local router failure. Option 
3 provides link and local router redundancy but does not provide for an ISP failure. Option 4 
provides for full redundancy of the local router, links, and the ISPs.
Figure 3-8
Internet Multihoming Options
VPN/Remote Access Module
The VPN/remote access module provides remote-access termination services, including authentica-
tion for remote users and sites. If you use a remote-access terminal server, this module connects to 
the PSTN network. Today’s networks often prefer VPNs over remote-access terminal servers and 
dedicated WAN links. VPNs reduce communication expenses by leveraging the infrastructure of 
SPs. For critical applications, the cost savings might be offset by a reduction of enterprise control 
and the loss of deterministic service. Remote ofﬁces, mobile users, and home ofﬁces access the 
Internet using the local SP with secured IP Security (IPSec) tunnels to the VPN/remote access mod-
ule via the Internet module. 
Figure 3-9 shows an example of a VPN design. Branch ofﬁces obtain local Internet access from an 
ISP. Home users also obtain local Internet access. VPN software creates secured VPN tunnels to the 
VPN server that is located in the VPN module of the Enterprise Edge.

Service Provider (SP) Edge
The SP Edge consists of edge services such as the following:
I
Internet services
I
PSTN services
I
WAN services
Enterprises use SPs to acquire network services. ISPs offer enterprises access to the Internet. ISP 
have the ability to route the enterprise’s networks to their network and to upstream and peer Internet 
providers. Some SPs can provide Internet services with DSL access. 
For voice services, PSTN providers offer access to the global public voice network. WAN SPs offer 
Frame Relay, ATM, and other WAN services for Enterprise site-to-site connectivity.
The SP Edge is not a test topic. For the test, focus on the Enterprise Campus and Enterprise Edge 
modules of the Enterprise Composite Network model.
Network Availability
This section covers designs for high-availability network services in the access layer. 
When designing a network topology for a customer who has critical systems, services, or network 
paths, you should determine the likelihood that these components will fail and design redundancy 
where necessary. Consider incorporating one of the following types of redundancy into your design:
I
Workstation-to-router redundancy in the building-access layer
I
Server redundancy in the server farm module
I
Route redundancy within and between network components
I
Media redundancy in the access layer
The sections that follow discuss each type of redundancy.
Workstation-to-Router Redundancy
When a workstation has trafﬁc to send to a station that is not local, the workstation has many 
possible ways to discover the address of a router on its network segment, including the following:
I
ARP
I
Explicit conﬁguration
I
Router Discovery Protocol (RDP)
I
RIP 
I
HSRP

Network Availability     61
The sections that follow cover each of these methods.
ARP
Some IP workstations send an ARP frame to ﬁnd a remote station. A router running proxy ARP can 
respond with its data link layer address. Cisco routers run proxy ARP by default.
Explicit Conﬁguration
Most IP workstations must be conﬁgured with the IP address of a default router, which is sometimes 
called the default gateway.
In an IP environment, the most common method for a workstation to ﬁnd a server is via explicit 
conﬁguration (a default router). If the workstation’s default router becomes unavailable, you must 
reconﬁgure the workstation with the address of a different router. Some IP stacks enable you to 
conﬁgure multiple default routers, but many other IP implementations only support one default 
router. HSRP provides a solution for hosts with only one default router.
RDP
RFC 1256 speciﬁes an extension to the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) that allows an IP 
workstation and router to run RDP to let the workstation learn the address of a router.
RIP 
An IP workstation can run RIP to learn about routers. You should use RIP in passive mode rather 
than active mode. (Active mode means that the station sends RIP frames every 30 seconds.) Usually 
in these implementations, the workstation is a UNIX system running the routed UNIX process.
HSRP
The Cisco HSRP provides a way for IP workstations to keep communicating on the internetwork 
even if their default router becomes unavailable. HSRP works by creating a phantom router that has 
its own IP and MAC addresses. The workstations use this phantom router as their default router.
HSRP routers on a LAN communicate among themselves to designate two routers as active and 
standby. The active router sends periodic hello messages. The other HSRP routers listen for the hello 
messages. If the active router fails and the other HSRP routers stop receiving hello messages, the 
standby router takes over and becomes the active router. Because the new active router assumes both 
the IP and MAC addresses of the phantom, end nodes see no change at all. They continue to send 
packets to the phantom router’s MAC address, and the new active router delivers those packets.

62     Chapter 3: Network Structure Models
HSRP also works for proxy ARP. When an active HSRP router receives an ARP request for a node 
that is not on the local LAN, the router replies with the phantom router’s MAC address instead of 
its own. If the router that originally sent the ARP reply later loses its connection, the new active 
router can still deliver the trafﬁc.
Figure 3-11 shows a sample implementation of HSRP.
Figure 3-11
Example of HSRP: The Phantom Router Represents the Real Routers
In Figure 3-11, the following sequence occurs:
1.
The workstation is conﬁgured to use the phantom router (192.168.1.1) as its default router.
2.
Upon booting, the routers elect Router A as the HSRP active router. The active router does the 
work for the HSRP phantom. Router B is the HSRP standby router.
3.
When the workstation sends an ARP frame to ﬁnd its default router, Router A responds with the 
phantom router’s MAC address.
4.
If Router A goes ofﬂine, Router B takes over as the active router, continuing the delivery of the 
workstation’s packets. The change is transparent to the workstation. 
Server Redundancy
Some environments need fully redundant (mirrored) ﬁle and application servers. For example, in a 
brokerage ﬁrm where traders must access data to buy and sell stocks, two or more redundant servers 
can replicate the data. Also, you can deploy CM servers in clusters for redundancy. The servers 
should be on different networks and power supplies.
Route Redundancy
Designing redundant routes has two purposes: balancing loads and increasing availability.
Workstation
Router A Ethernet 0
IP: 192.168.1.2/24
E0
S0

Router B Ethernet 0

Network Availability     63
Load Balancing
Most IP routing protocols can balance loads across parallel links that have equal cost. Use the 
maximum-paths command to change the number of links that the router will balance over for 
IP; the default is four, and the maximum is six. To support load balancing, keep the bandwidth 
consistent within a layer of the hierarchical model so that all paths have the same cost. (The Cisco 
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) and Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP) are exceptions because 
they can load balance trafﬁc across multiple routes that have different metrics by using a feature 
called variance.)
A hop-based routing protocol does load balancing over unequal bandwidth paths as long as the hop 
count is equal. After the slower link becomes saturated, packet loss at the saturated link prevents full 
utilization of the higher capacity links; this scenario is called pinhole congestion. You can avoid 
pinhole congestion by designing and provisioning equal bandwidth links within one layer of the 
hierarchy or by using a routing protocol that takes bandwidth into account.
IP load balancing in a Cisco router depends on which switching mode the router uses. Process 
switching load balances on a packet-by-packet basis. Fast, autonomous, silicon, optimum, distrib-
uted, and NetFlow switching load balance on a destination-by-destination basis because the proces-
sor caches information used to encapsulate the packets based on the destination for these types of 
switching modes.
Increasing Availability
In addition to facilitating load balancing, redundant routes increase network availability.
You should keep bandwidth consistent within a given design component to facilitate load balancing. 
Another reason to keep bandwidth consistent within a layer of a hierarchy is that routing protocols 
converge much faster on multiple equal-cost paths to a destination network.
By using redundant, meshed network designs, you can minimize the effect of link failures. 
Depending on the convergence time of the routing protocols, a single link failure will not have a 
catastrophic effect. 
You can design redundant network links to provide a full mesh or a well-connected partial mesh. In 
a full-mesh network, every router has a link to every other router, as shown in Figure 3-12. A full-
mesh network provides complete redundancy and also provides good performance because there is 
just a single-hop delay between any two sites. The number of links in a full mesh is n(n–1)/2, where 
n is the number of routers. Each router is connected to every other router. A well-connected partial-
mesh network provides every router with links to at least two other routing devices in the network.

64     Chapter 3: Network Structure Models
Figure 3-12
Full-Mesh Network: Every Router Has a Link to Every Other Router in the Network
A full-mesh network can be expensive to implement in WANs due to the required number of links. 
In addition, groups of routers that broadcast routing updates or service advertisements have practical 
limits to scaling. As the number of routing peers increases, the amount of bandwidth and CPU 
resources devoted to processing broadcasts increases.
A suggested guideline is to keep broadcast trafﬁc at less than 20 percent of the bandwidth of each 
link; this amount limits the number of peer routers that can exchange routing tables or service 
advertisements. When planning redundancy, follow guidelines for simple, hierarchical design. 
Figure 3-13 illustrates a classic hierarchical and redundant enterprise design that uses a partial-mesh 
rather than a full-mesh topology. For LAN designs, links between the access and distribution layer 
can be Fast Ethernet, with links to the core at Gigabit Ethernet speeds.

Network Availability     65
Media Redundancy
In mission-critical applications, it is often necessary to provide redundant media.
In switched networks, switches can have redundant links to each other. This redundancy is good 
because it minimizes downtime, but it can result in broadcasts continuously circling the network, 
which is called a broadcast storm. Because Cisco switches implement the IEEE 802.1d spanning-
tree algorithm, you can avoid this looping in the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). The spanning-tree 
algorithm guarantees that only one path is active between two network stations. The algorithm 
permits redundant paths that are automatically activated when the active path experiences problems.
Because WAN links are often critical pieces of the internetwork, WAN environments often deploy 
redundant media. As shown in Figure 3-14, you can provision backup links so they become active 
when a primary link goes down or becomes congested.
Figure 3-14
Backup Links Can Provide Redundancy
Often, backup links use a different technology. For example, a leased line can be in parallel with a 
backup dialup line or ISDN circuit. By using ﬂoating static routes, you can specify that the backup 
route have a higher administrative distance (used by Cisco routers to select routing information) so 
that it is not normally used unless the primary route goes down. This design is less available than 
the partial mesh presented previously. Typically, on-demand backup links reduce WAN charges.
NOTE
When provisioning backup links, learn as much as possible about the physical circuit 
routing. Different carriers sometimes use the same facilities, meaning that your backup path 
might be susceptible to the same failures as your primary path. You should do some investigative 
work to ensure that your backup really is acting as a backup.
Primary
Backup
Access Sites

66     Chapter 3: Network Structure Models
You can combine backup links with load balancing and channel aggregation. Channel aggregation 
means that a router can bring up multiple channels (for example, ISDN B channels) as bandwidth 
requirements increase.
Cisco supports the Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MPPP), which is an Internet Engineering Task 
Force (IETF) standard for ISDN B channel (or asynchronous serial interface) aggregation. MPPP 
does not specify how a router should accomplish the decision-making process to bring up extra 
channels. Instead, it seeks to ensure that packets arrive in sequence at the receiving router. Then, the 
data is encapsulated within PPP and the datagram is given a sequence number. At the receiving 
router, PPP uses this sequence number to re-create the original data stream. Multiple channels 
appear as one logical link to upper-layer protocols.

Foundation Summary     67
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
The CCDA exam requires that you understand the three layers of a hierarchical network design:
I
The core layer and campus-backbone component provide fast transport within sites.
I
The distribution layer and building-distribution component provide policy-based connectivity.
I
The access layer and building-access component provide workgroup and user access to the 
network.
The Enterprise Composite Network model divides the network into three major functional 
components:
I
Enterprise Campus (campus infrastructure, edge distribution, server farm, network 
management)
The campus infrastructure includes the building-access and building-distribution components 
and the shared campus-backbone component or campus core. The edge distribution provides 
connectivity to the Enterprise Edge. High availability is implemented in the server farm, and 
network management monitors all modules in the Enterprise Campus and Enterprise Edge.
I
Enterprise Edge (e-commerce, Internet, VPN/remote access, WAN)
The e-commerce module provides high availability for business servers and connects to the 
Internet module. The WAN module provides Frame Relay or other WAN technology. The VPN 
module provides secure site-to-site remote access over the Internet.  
I
SP Edge (Internet, PSTN, WAN)
ISPs offer Internet access to the enterprise. PSTN providers provide voice services. WAN 
providers in the SP Edge provide Frame Relay and other WAN services by.
Figure 3-15 shows an example of an Enterprise composite Network Model, as described here.

Ethernet Design Rules
Ethernet is the underlying basis for the technologies most widely used in LANs. In the 1980s and 
early 1990s, most networks used 10Mbps Ethernet, deﬁned initially by Digital, Intel, and Xerox 
(DIX Ethernet Version II) and later by the IEEE 802.3 Working Group. The IEEE 802.3-2002 
standard contains physical speciﬁcations for Ethernet technologies through 1000Mbps. Table 4-2 
describes the speciﬁcations. The table also includes some physical (100BASE-T) speciﬁcations for 
Fast Ethernet. Table 4-2 provides scalability information that you can use when provisioning IEEE 
802.3 networks.
The most signiﬁcant design rule for Ethernet is that the round-trip propagation delay in one collision 
domain must not exceed 512 bit times, which is a requirement for collision detection to work cor-
rectly. This rule means that the maximum round-trip delay for a 10-Mbps Ethernet network is 51.2 
microseconds. The maximum round-trip delay for a 100-Mbps Ethernet network is only 5.12 micro-
seconds because the bit time on a 100-Mbps Ethernet network is 0.01 microseconds as opposed to 
0.1 microseconds on a 10-Mbps Ethernet network.
10-Mbps Fiber Ethernet Design Rules
Table 4-3 provides some guidelines for ﬁber-based 10-Mbps Ethernet media for network designs. 
The 10BASE-FP standard uses a passive-star topology. The 10BASE-FB standard is for a backbone 
or repeater-based system. The 10BASE-FL standard provides speciﬁcations on ﬁber links.

100-Mbps Fast Ethernet Design Rules
The IEEE introduced the IEEE 802.3u-1995 standard to provide Ethernet speeds of 100Mbps over 
UTP and ﬁber cabling. The 100BASE-T standard is similar to 10Mbps Ethernet in that it uses carrier 
sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD), runs on Category (CAT) 3, 4, and 5 UTP cable, 
and preserves the frame formats. Connectivity still uses hubs, repeaters, and bridges.
100Mbps Ethernet, or Fast Ethernet, topologies present some distinct constraints on the network 
design because of their speed. The combined latency due to cable lengths and repeaters must con-
form to the speciﬁcations for the network to work properly. This section discusses these issues and 
provides sample calculations.
The overriding design rule for 100Mbps Ethernet networks is that the round-trip collision delay 
must not exceed 512 bit times. However, the bit time on a 100Mbps Ethernet network is 0.01 micro-
seconds, as opposed to 0.1 microseconds on a 10Mbps Ethernet network. Therefore, the maximum 
round-trip delay for a 100Mbps Ethernet network is 5.12 microseconds, as opposed to the more 
lenient 51.2 microseconds in a 10Mbps Ethernet network.
The following are speciﬁcations for Fast Ethernet, each of which is described in the following 
sections:
I
100BASE-TX
I
100BASE-T4
I
100BASE-FX
100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet
The 100BASE-TX speciﬁcation uses CAT 5 UTP wiring.  Like 10BASE-T, Fast Ethernet uses only 
two pairs of the four-pair UTP wiring. If CAT 5 cabling is already in place, upgrading to Fast

Ethernet requires only a hub or switch and network interface card (NIC) upgrades. Because of 
the low cost, most of today’s installations use switches. The speciﬁcations are as follows:
I
Transmission over CAT 5 UTP or CAT 1 shielded twisted-pair (STP) wire.
I
RJ-45 connector (same as in 10BASE-T).
I
Punchdown blocks in the wiring closet must be CAT 5 certiﬁed.
I
4B5B coding.
100BASE-T4 Fast Ethernet
The 100BASE-T4 speciﬁcation was developed to support UTP wiring at the CAT 3 level. This spec-
iﬁcation takes advantage of higher-speed Ethernet without recabling to CAT 5 UTP. This implemen-
tation is not widely deployed. The speciﬁcations are as follows:
I
Transmission over CAT 3, 4, or 5 UTP wiring.
I
Three pairs are used for transmission, and the fourth pair is used for collision detection.
I
No separate transmit and receive pairs are present, so full-duplex operation is not possible.
I
8B6T coding.
100BASE-FX
The 100BASE-FX speciﬁcation for ﬁber is as follows:
I
Operates over two strands of multimode or single-mode ﬁber cabling
I
Can transmit over greater distances than copper media
I
Uses media interface connector (MIC), Stab & Twist (ST), or Stab & Click (SC) ﬁber 
connectors deﬁned for FDDI and 10BASE-FX networks
I
4B5B coding
100BASE-T Repeaters
To make 100-Mbps Ethernet work, distance limitations are much more severe than those required 
for 10Mbps Ethernet.  For repeater networks, there is no ﬁve-hub rule; Fast Ethernet is limited to two 
repeaters. The general rule is that a 100Mbps Ethernet has a maximum diameter of 205 meters (m) 
with UTP cabling, whereas 10Mbps Ethernet has a maximum diameter of 500 m with 10BASE-T 
and 2500 m with 10BASE5. Most networks today use switches instead of repeaters, which limits 
the length of 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX to 100 m between the switch and host.

82     Chapter 4: LAN Design
The distance limitation imposed depends on the type of repeater.
The IEEE 100BASE-T speciﬁcation deﬁnes two types of repeaters: Class I and Class II. Class I 
repeaters have a latency (delay) of 0.7 microseconds or less. Only one repeater hop is allowed. Class 
II repeaters have a latency of 0.46 microseconds or less. One or two repeater hops are allowed.
Table 4-4 shows the maximum size of collision domains, depending on the type of repeater.
Again, for switched networks, the maximum distance between the switch and the host is 100 m.
Gigabit Ethernet Design Rules
Gigabit Ethernet was ﬁrst speciﬁed by two standards: IEEE 802.3z-1998 and 802.3ab-1999. The 
IEEE 802.3z standard speciﬁes the operation of Gigabit Ethernet over ﬁber and coaxial cable and 
introduces the Gigabit Media Independent Interface (GMII). These standards are superseded by the 
latest revision of all the 802.3 standards included in IEEE 802.3-2002.
The IEEE 802.3ab standard speciﬁed the operation of Gigabit Ethernet over CAT 5 UTP. Gigabit 
Ethernet still retains the frame formats and frame sizes, and it still uses CSMA/CD. As with Ethernet 
and Fast Ethernet, full duplex operation is possible. Differences appear in the encoding; Gigabit 
Ethernet uses 8B10B coding with simple nonreturn to zero (NRZ). Because of the 20 percent 
overhead, pulses run at 1250 MHz to achieve a 1000 Mbps throughput. 
The following section covers the following speciﬁcations:

1000BASE-LX Long Wavelength Gigabit Ethernet
The IEEE 1000BASE-LX uses long wavelength optics over a pair of ﬁber strands. The speciﬁca-

I
Use on multimode or single-mode ﬁber

1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet over UTP
The IEEE standard for 1000Mbps Ethernet over CAT 5 UTP was IEEE 802.3ab; it was approved in 
June 1999. It is now included in IEEE 802.3-2002. This standard uses the four pairs in the cable. 
(100BASE-TX and 10BASE-T Ethernet only use two pairs.) The speciﬁcations are as follows:
I
CAT 5, four-pair UTP.
I
Maximum length is 100 m. 
I
Encoding deﬁned is a ﬁve-level coding scheme.
I
1 byte is sent over the four pairs at 1250 MHz.
Table 4-5 covers Gigabit Ethernet scalability constraints.
10 Gigabit Ethernet
IEEE 802.3ae, published in August 2002, speciﬁes a standard for 10Gpbs Ethernet. It is deﬁned only 
for full-duplex operation over optical media. It allows use of Ethernet frames over distances typi-
cally encountered in metropolitan-area networks (MANs) and WANs. Other uses include data cen-
ters, corporate backbones, and server farms. More information is available at the 10 Gigabit Alliance 
website, http://www.10gea.org, and through the IEEE. This is not currently a CCDA test topic.
Fast EtherChannel
The Cisco EtherChannel implementations provide a method to increase the bandwidth between two 
systems by bundling Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet links. When bundling Fast Ethernet links, use 
the term Fast EtherChannel. EtherChannel port bundles allow you to group multiple ports into a 
single logical transmission path between the switch and a router, host, or another switch. EtherChannels 
provide increased bandwidth, load sharing, and redundancy. If a link fails in the bundle, the other 
links take on the trafﬁc load. You can conﬁgure EtherChannel bundles as trunk links.

Depending on your hardware, you can form an EtherChannel with up to eight compatibly conﬁg-
ured ports on the switch. The participating ports must have the same speed and duplex mode and 
belong to the same VLAN.
Token Ring Design Rules
Token Ring was developed by IBM in the 1970s. In the 1980s, Token Ring and Ethernet competed 
as the preferred media for LANs. The IEEE developed the IEEE 802.5 speciﬁcation based on the 
IBM Token Ring speciﬁcations. The 802.5 working group is now an inactive working group of 
the IEEE. The most recent speciﬁcation is IEEE 802.5-1998. More information appears at http://
www.8025.org.
Table 4-6 lists some media characteristics for designing Token Ring segments.
FDDI Design Rules
FDDI is a 100-Mbps token-passing, dual-ring LAN media that uses ﬁber-optic cable. FDDI was a 
high-speed campus-backbone technology before Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet became avail-
able. FDDI uses a dual-counter rotating-ring architecture with a primary and secondary ring. In 
normal operation, the primary ring is active and the secondary ring is idle. If a failure occurs, the 
secondary ring provides redundancy.
FDDI media access does not appear in new enterprise networks because Fast and Gigabit Ethernet 
have replaced it as a preferred Layer 2 LAN and MAN technology.  The FDDI speciﬁcation does 
not actually specify the maximum segment length or network diameter. It speciﬁes the amount of 
allowed power loss, which works out to the approximate distances shown in Table 4-7.

Wireless LANs
Wireless LANs (WLANs) provide the capability of accessing internetworking resources without 
having to be “wired” to the network. WLANs applications include inside-building access, LAN 
extension, outside building-to-building communications, public access, and small ofﬁce/home 
ofﬁce (SOHO) communications.  
The ﬁrst standard for wireless LANs is IEEE 802.11, approved by the IEEE in 1997. The current 
speciﬁcation is IEEE 802.11-1999. IEEE 802.11 implemented wireless LANs at speeds of 1 Mbps 
and 2 Mbps using Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and Frequency Hopping Spread 
Spectrum (FHSS) on the physical layer of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. DSSS 
divides data into separate sections; each section travels over different frequencies at the same time. 
FHSS uses a frequency-hopping sequence to send data in bursts. With FHSS, some data transmits 
at Frequency 1, and then the system hops to Frequency 2 to send more data, and so on, returning to 
transmit more data at Frequency 1.
Current implementations use the IEEE 802.11b standard.  The IEEE 802.11b standard is referred as 
“high-rate.” It provides speeds of 11, 5.5, 2, and 1 Mbps. An interoperability certiﬁcation for IEEE 
802.11b WLANs is Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi). The Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance 
(WECA) governs the Wi-Fi certiﬁcation. IEEE 802.11b uses DSSS and is backward compatible 
with 802.11 systems that use DSSS.  The modulation techniques used by IEEE 802.11b follow:
I
Complimentary Code Keying (CCK), at 5.5 and 11 Mbps
I
Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (DQPSK), at 2 Mbps
I
Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying (DBPSK), at 1 Mbps

Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID)
WLANs use an SSID to identify the “network name” of the WLAN. The SSID can be 2 to 32 char-
acters in length. All devices in the WLAN must have the same conﬁgured SSID to communicate.
WLAN Access Method
The IEEE 802.11 Mandatory Access Control (MAC) layer implements carrier sense multiple access 
collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) as an access method. With CSMA/CA, each WLAN station listens 
to see whether there is a station transmitting. If there is no activity, the station then transmits. If there 
is activity, the station uses a random countdown timer. When the timer expires, the station transmits. 
WLAN Modes
WLAN architecture has three modes of operation. The ﬁrst mode is the Basic Service Set (BSS). In 
BSS mode, all stations communicate with the access point (AP). The AP provides communication 
between clients and connects the WLAN network with the wired LAN. As shown in Figure 4-2, in 
BSS mode clients do not communicate directly with each other; all communication happens through 
the AP. BSS is also referred as Infrastructure mode.
Figure 4-2
BSS (Infrastructure) Mode
The second mode is the Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). As shown in Figure 4-3, IBSS mode 
stations communicate directly with each other without using an AP. IBSS is also known as ad hoc 
mode.

where APs have connectivity in the wired LAN, providing a distribution system for roaming 
capabilities.

Frequencies Used by Wireless LANs
The IEEE 802.11b standard uses the 2.4 GHz band of the Industrial, Scientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM) 
frequencies.  The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) authorizes ISM frequencies for 
unlicensed use in the United States. The three ISM frequency bands follow:

IEEE 802.11, 802.11b, and 802.11g standards all use the 2.4 ISM band for unlicensed frequency use.
The IEEE 802.11a standard uses the 5 GHz bands of the Unlicensed National Information Infra-
structure (UNII) frequencies. These frequency bands were allocated in addition to the ISM bands 
for unlicensed used in the U.S.  The three UNII bands are
I
5.15 to 5.25 GHz (lower band)
I
5.25 to 5.35 GHz (middle band)
I
5.75 to 5.85 GHz (upper band)
WLAN Security
WLANs provides an effective solution for the hard-to-reach locations and enable mobility to a level 
that was previously unattainable. WLANs without any encryption present a security risk because 
publicly available software can snoop the SSIDs.  The productivity improvements with WLANs are 
just beginning, however. The WEP security protocol, used in the IEEE 802.11b standard, is con-
sidered faulty and vulnerable to numerous attacks. The 802.11b protocol is the most commonly 
deployed wireless protocol, and although it has the ability for 64-bit and 128-bit encryption, readily 
available software can crack the encryption scheme.
Unauthorized Access
A problem that confronts WLANs comes from the fact that wireless signals are not easily controlled 
or contained. WEP works at the data link layer, sharing the same key for all nodes that communicate. 
The 802.11 standard was deployed because it allowed bandwidth speed up to 11 Mbps and it 
is based on DSSS technology. DSSS also enables APs to identify WLAN cards via their MAC 
addresses. Because traditional physical boundaries do not apply to wireless networks, attackers can 
gain access using wireless from outside the physical security perimeter. Attackers achieve unautho-
rized access if the wireless network does not have a mechanism to compare a MAC address on a 
wireless card to a database that contains a directory with access rights. An individual can roam 
within an area, and each AP that comes in contact with that card must also rely on a directory. Stat-
ically allowing access via a MAC address is also insecure because MAC addresses can be spoofed.  
Securing the payload and ensuring proper authentication are the two focus areas for the Secure blue-
print for Enterprise Networks(SAFE) WLAN design developed by Cisco. 
Some APs can implement MAC address and protocol ﬁltering to enhance security or limit the pro-
tocols used over the WLAN. Again, attackers can hack MAC address ﬁltering. A user can listen for 
transmissions, gather a list of MAC addresses, and then use one of those MAC addresses to connect 
to the AP.

90     Chapter 4: LAN Design
SAFE WLAN Design Approach
The SAFE WLAN design approach makes two assumptions, which this chapter presents. The 
assumptions are that all WLAN devices are connected to a unique IP subnet and that most services 
available to the wired network are also available to the wireless nodes. Using these two assumptions, 
the SAFE WLAN designs offer two basic security approaches: 
I
The use of the Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) to secure authentication
I
The use of virtual private networks (VPNs) with IP Security (IPSec) to secure trafﬁc from the 
WLAN to the wired network
Considering WLAN as an alternative access methodology, remember that the services these WLAN 
users access are often the same accessed by the wired users. WLAN opens a new world of access 
for the hacker, and you should consider the risks prior to deployment.
To enhance security, you can implement WLANs with IPSec VPN software, use the IEEE 
802.1X-2001 port-based access control protocol, and use dynamic WEP keys. 
IEEE 802.1X Port-Based Authentication
IEEE 802.1X-2001 is a port-based authentication standard for LANs. It authenticates a user before 
allowing services. You can use it on Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and WLAN networks.
With IEEE 802.1X, client workstations run client software to request access to services. Clients use 
the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to communicate with the LAN switch. The LAN 
switch veriﬁes client information with the authentication server and relays the response to the client. 
LAN switches use a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) client to communicate 
with the server. The RADIUS authentication server validates the identity of the client and authorizes 
the client. The server uses RADIUS with EAP extensions to make the authorization. 
Dynamic WEP Keys and LEAP
Cisco also offers dynamic per-user, per-session WEP keys to provide additional security over stati-
cally conﬁgured WEP keys, which are not unique per user. For centralized user-based authentica-
tion, Cisco developed LEAP. LEAP uses mutual authentication between the client and the network 
server and uses IEEE 802.1X for 802.11 authentication messaging. LEAP uses a RADIUS server to 
manage user information. 
LEAP is a combination of 802.1X and the EAP. It combines the capability to authenticate to various 
servers such as RADIUS and forces the WLAN user to log in to an access point that compares the 
login information to RADIUS.

LAN Media     91
Because the WLAN access depends on receiving an address, using Dynamic Host Conﬁguration 
Protocol (DHCP), and the authentication of the user, using RADIUS, the WLAN needs constant 
access to these back-end servers. In addition, LEAP does not support one-time passwords (OTP), so 
you must use good password-security practices. The password issue and maintenance practice is a 
basic component of corporate security policy. 
In the same way you place Domain Name System (DNS) servers accessible via the Internet on a 
demilitarized zone (DMZ) segment, you should apply a similar strategy to the RADIUS and DHCP 
servers accessible to the WLAN. These servers should be secondary servers that are on a different 
segment from their primary counterparts. Such placement ensures that any attacks launched on these 
servers are contained within that segment.
You should control access to the servers. Consider the WLAN an unsecured segment and apply 
appropriate segmentation and Layer 3 ﬁltering. Such a step ensures that WLAN access is controlled 
and directed to only those areas that need it. For example, you do not want to permit WLAN access 
to management servers, voice networks, and HR servers.
You must also protect these servers against attack. The criticality of these servers makes them an 
ideal target for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Consider using host-based intrusion-detection 
systems (IDSs) to protect these devices.  
Other IEEE WLAN Standards
The IEEE 802.11a standard provides an increase of throughput from IEEE 802.11b with speeds up 
to 54 Mbps. IEEE 802.11a uses the 5 GHz bands of the UNII frequencies, and for this reason, it is 
not backward-compatible with IEEE 802.11b WLANs.
IEEE 802.11g is an emerging standard that has been recently approved by the IEEE working group. 
It provides faster WLAN speeds in the ISM 2.4 GHz band, up to 54 Mbps. IEEE 802.11g is 
backward-compatible with 802.11b WLANs, albeit at the 802.11b slower data rate.
IEEE 802.11d provides speciﬁcations for WLANs in markets not served by the current 802.11, 
802.11b, and 802.11a standards. It also provides enhancements to the security and authentication 
protocols for WLANs.
The emerging IEEE 802.15 standard provides speciﬁcations for Wireless Personal Area Networks 
(WPANs). The emerging IEEE 802.16 standard provides speciﬁcations for ﬁxed broadband wireless 
access.

LAN Hardware
This section covers the hardware devices and how to apply them to LAN design. You place devices 
in the LAN depending on their roles and capabilities. LAN devices are categorized based on how 
they operate in the OSI model. This section covers the following devices: 
I
Repeaters
I
Hubs
I
Bridges
I
Switches
I
Routers
I
Layer 3 switches
Repeaters
Repeaters are the basic unit in networks that connect separate segments. Repeaters take incoming 
frames, regenerate the preamble, amplify the signals, and send the frame out all other interfaces. 
Repeaters operate in the physical layer of the OSI model. Because repeaters are not aware of packets 
or frame formats, they do not control broadcasts or collision domains. Repeaters are said to be 
protocol transparent because they are not aware of upper-layer protocols such as IP, Internetwork 
Packet Exchange (IPX), and so on.
One basic rule of using Ethernet repeaters is the 5-4-3 Rule. The maximum path between two stations 
on the network should not be more than ﬁve segments with four repeaters between those segments 
and no more than three populated segments. Repeaters introduce a small amount of latency, or delay, 
when propagating the frames. A transmitting device must be able to detect a collision with another 
device within the speciﬁed time after the delay introduced by the cable segments and repeaters is 
factored in. The 512 bit-time speciﬁcation also governs segment lengths. A more detailed explana-
tion of the speciﬁcation appears at http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/
ethernet.htm. Figure 4-5 illustrates an example of the 5-4-3 Rule.
Hubs
With the increasing density of LANs in the late 1980s and early 1990s, hubs were introduced to 
concentrate Thinnet and 10BASE-T networks in the wiring closet. Traditional hubs operate on the 
physical layer of the OSI model and perform the same functions as basic repeaters. The difference 
is that hubs have more ports than basic repeaters.

LAN Hardware     93
Figure 4-5
Repeater 5-4-3 Rule
Bridges
Bridges connect separate segments of a network. They differ from repeaters in that bridges are 
intelligent devices that operate in the data link layer of the OSI model. Bridges control the collision 
domains on the network. Bridges also learn the MAC layer addresses of each node on each segment 
and on which interface they are located. For any incoming frame, bridges forward the frame only if 
the destination MAC address is on another port or if the bridge is not aware of its location. The latter 
is called ﬂooding. Bridges ﬁlter any incoming frames with destination MAC addresses that are on 
the same segment from where the frame arrives; they do not forward these frames.
Bridges are store-and-forward devices. They store the entire frame and verify the cyclic redundancy 
check (CRC) before forwarding. If the bridges detect a CRC error, they discard the frame. Bridges 
are protocol transparent; they are not aware of the upper-layer protocols such as IP, IPX, and 
AppleTalk. Bridges are designed to ﬂood all unknown and broadcast trafﬁc.
Bridges implement the STP to build a loop-free network topology. Bridges communicate with each 
other, exchanging information such as priority and bridge interface MAC addresses. They select a 
root bridge and then implement the STP. Some interfaces are in a blocking state, whereas other 
bridges have interfaces in forwarding mode. Figure 4-6 shows a network with bridges. With STP, 
there is no load sharing or dual paths as there is in routing. STP provides recovery of bridge failure 
by changing blocked interfaces to a forwarding state if a primary link fails. Although DEC and IBM 
versions are available, the IEEE 802.1d standard is the STP most commonly used.

94     Chapter 4: LAN Design
Figure 4-6
Spanning Tree Protocol
The spanning-tree topology elects a root bridge as the root. It places all ports that are not needed 
to reach the root bridge in blocking mode. The selection of the root bridge is based on the lowest 
numerical bridge priority. The bridge priority ranges from 0 to 65,535. If all bridges have the same 
bridge priority, then the bridge with the lowest MAC address becomes the root. The concatenation 
of the bridge priority and the MAC address is the bridge identiﬁcation (BID). Physical changes to 
the network force spanning-tree recalculation.
Switches
Switches use specialized integrated circuits to reduce the latency common to regular bridges. 
Switches are the evolution of bridges. Some switches have a capability to run in cut-through mode, 
where the switch does not wait for the entire frame to enter its buffer; instead, it begins to forward 
the frame as soon as it ﬁnishes reading the destination MAC address. Cut-through operation 
increases the probability that frames with errors are propagated on the network because it forwards 
the frame before the entire frame is buffered and checked for errors. Because of these problems, 
most switches today perform store-and-forward operation as bridges do. As shown in Figure 4-7, 
switches are exactly the same as bridges with respect to collision-domain and broadcast-domain 
characteristics. Each port on a switch is a separate collision domain. By default, all ports in a switch 
are in the same broadcast domain. Assignment to different VLANs changes that behavior.

LAN Hardware     95
Figure 4-7
Switches Control Collision Domains
Switches have characteristics similar to bridges; however, they have more ports and they run faster. 
Switches keep a table of MAC addresses per port, and they implement STP. Switches are data link 
layer devices. They are transparent to protocols operating at the network layer and above. Each port 
on a switch is a separate collision domain but part of the same broadcast domain. Switches do not 
control broadcasts on the network.
The use of LAN switches instead of bridges or hubs is nearly universal. Switches are preferred over 
shared technology because they provide full bandwidth in each direction when conﬁgured in duplex 
mode. All the devices on a hub share the bandwidth in a single collision domain. Switches can also 
use VLANs to provide more segmentation. The LAN Design Types and Models section in this 
chapter discusses VLANs.
Routers
Routers make forwarding decisions based on network layer addresses. In addition to controlling 
collision domains, routers bound data link layer broadcast domains. Each interface of a router is a 
separate broadcast domain. Routers do not forward data link layer broadcasts. IP deﬁnes network 
layer broadcast domains with a subnet and mask. Routers are aware of the network protocol, which 
means they are capable of forwarding packets of routed protocols such as IP, IPX, and AppleTalk. 
Figure 4-8 shows a router; each interface is a broadcast and a collision domain.

96     Chapter 4: LAN Design
Routers exchange information about destination networks using one of several routing protocols. 
Routers use routing protocols to build a list of destination networks and to identify the best routes 
to reach those destinations. The following are routing protocols. The lists are organized by the 
protocols that can be routed.
For routing TCP/IP, use the following:
I
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
I
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
I
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
I
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS)
I
Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
For routing Novell, use the following:
I
Novell Routing Information Protocol (Novell RIP)
I
NetWare Link Services Protocol (NLSP)
I
EIGRP
Chapter 11, “Routing Protocol Selection Criteria,” discusses routing protocols in further detail.
Routers provide the translation of data link protocols. They are the preferred method of forwarding 
packets between networks of differing media, such as Ethernet to Token Ring, Ethernet to FDDI, or 
Ethernet to serial. They also provide methods to ﬁlter trafﬁc based on the network layer address, 
route redundancy, load balancing, hierarchical addressing, and multicast routing.
Layer 3 Switches
LAN switches that are capable of running routing protocols are Layer 3 switches. These switches 
are capable of running routing protocols and communicating with neighboring routers. Layer 3 
switches have LAN technology interfaces that perform network layer packet forwarding. Routers 
must still provide connectivity to WAN circuits. The use of switching technologies at the network 
layer greatly accelerates packet forwarding between connected LANs, including VLANs. You can 
use the router capacity you save to implement other features, such as security ﬁltering and intrusion 
detection. 
Layer 3 switches perform the functions of both data link layer switches and network layer routers. 
Each port is a collision domain. You can group ports into network layer broadcast domains (sub-
nets). As with routers, a routing protocol provides network information to other network layer 
devices (subnets), and a routing protocol provides network information to other Layer 3 switches 
and routers.

LAN Design Types and Models     97
LAN Design Types and Models
LANs can be classiﬁed as large-building LANs, campus LANs, or small and remote LANs. The 
large-building LAN typically contains a major data center with high-speed access and ﬂoor commu-
nications closets; the large-building LAN is usually the headquarters in larger companies. Campus 
LANs provide connectivity between buildings on a campus. Redundancy is usually a requirement 
in large-building and campus LAN deployments. Small and remote LANs provide connectivity to 
remote ofﬁces with a relatively small number of nodes.
It is important to remember the Cisco Enterprise Composite Network model in network design. 
First, build a high-speed campus-backbone network to serve the campus or large buildings. Second, 
build the building-distribution layers, where you can apply policy. Finally, build the building-access 
layers, where LANs provide access to the network end stations.
Large-Building LANs
Large-building LANs are segmented by ﬂoors or departments. The building-access component 
serves one or more departments or ﬂoors. The building-distribution component serves one or more 
building-access components. Campus and building backbone devices connect the data center, 
building-distribution components, and the enterprise edge-distribution component. The access layer 
typically uses Layer 2 switches to contain costs, with more expensive Layer 3 switches in the 
distribution layer to provide policy enforcement. Current best practice is to also deploy Layer 3 
switches in the campus and building backbone. Figure 4-9 depicts a typical large-building design.
Each ﬂoor can have more than 200 users. Following a hierarchical model of building access, build-
ing distribution, and core, Fast Ethernet nodes can connect to the Layer 2 switches in the communi-
cations closet. Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet uplink ports from closet switches connect back to 
one or two (for redundancy) distribution switches. Distribution switches can provide connectivity to 
server farms that provide business applications, DHCP, DNS, intranet, and other services.
Enterprise Campus LANs
A campus LAN connects two or more buildings within a local geographic area using a high-
bandwidth LAN media backbone. Usually the enterprise owns the media (copper or ﬁber). High-
speed switching devices minimize latency. In today’s networks, Gigabit Ethernet campus backbones 
are the standard for new installations. In Figure 4-10, Layer 3 switches with Gigabit Ethernet media 
connect campus buildings.
TIP
Remember that the access layer should use low-end Layer 2 switches and that the 
distribution layer should use Layer 2 or Layer 3 switches.

LAN Design Types and Models     99
Ensure that you implement a hierarchical composite design on the campus LAN and that you assign 
network layer addressing to control broadcasts on the networks. Each building should have address-
ing assigned in such a way as to maximize address summarization. Apply contiguous subnets to 
buildings at the bit boundary to apply summarization and ease the design. Campus networks can 
support high-bandwidth applications such as video conferencing. Remember to use Layer 3 
switches with high-switching capabilities in the campus-backbone design. In smaller installations, 
it might be desirable to collapse the building-distribution component into the campus backbone. An 
increasingly viable alternative is to provide building access and distribution on a single device 
selected from among the smaller Layer 3 switches now available.
Small and Remote Site LANs
Small and remote sites usually connect to the corporate network via a small router. The LAN service 
is provided by a small LAN switch. The router ﬁlters broadcast to the WAN circuit and forward 
packets that require services from the corporate network. You can place a server at the small or 
remote site to provide DHCP and other local applications such as an NT backup domain controller 
and DNS; if not, you must conﬁgure the router to forward DHCP broadcasts and other types of 
services. As the site grows, you will need the structure provided by the Enterprise Composite 
Network model. Figure 4-11 shows a typical architecture of a small or remote LAN. 
Figure 4-11
Remote Ofﬁce LAN
Server-Farm Module
The server-farm or data-center module provides high-speed access to servers for the campus net-
works. You can attach servers to switches via Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet. Some campus 
deployments might need EtherChannel technology to meet trafﬁc requirements. Figure 4-12 shows 
an example of a server-farm module. Servers are connected via Fast Ethernet or Fast EtherChannel. 
WAN

100     Chapter 4: LAN Design
The server-farm switches connect via redundant uplink ports to the core switches. The largest 
deployments might ﬁnd it useful to hierarchically construct service to the data center using access 
and distribution network devices.
Figure 4-12
Server Farm
You can use the Server Load Balancing (SLB) feature to provide additional server redundancy. SLB 
is a Cisco IOS Software feature that provides IP-based server-load balancing. With SLB, a virtual 
server represents a group of real servers. Clients connect to the virtual IP address, and the SLB load-
balancing algorithm selects a real server for the connection. Figure 4-13 shows a diagram of the SLB 
environment. Client A makes a connection to the virtual IP address, and the SLB algorithm selects 
Server 1. For Client B, Server 2 is selected. For Client C, Server 3 is selected. The SLB can then 
select Servers 2 and 1 for Clients D and E.
Quality of Service Considerations
For the access layer of the campus LAN, you can classify and mark frames or packets to apply 
quality of service (QoS) policies in the distribution or at the Enterprise Edge. Classiﬁcation is a 
fundamental building block of QoS and involves recognizing and distinguishing between different 
trafﬁc steams. For example, you distinguish between web, FTP, and VoIP trafﬁc. Without 
classiﬁcation, all trafﬁc would be treated the same.
Marking sets certain bits in a packet or frame that has been classiﬁed. Marking is also referred as 
coloring or tagging. Layer 2 has two methods to mark frames for CoS:

Inter-Switch Link (ISL)

Server Load Balancing
The IEEE 802.1D-1998 standard describes IEEE 802.1p trafﬁc class expediting.
Both methods provide three bits for marking frames. The Cisco ISL is a proprietary trunk-
encapsulation method for carrying VLANs over Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. 
ISL appends tags to each frame to identify the VLAN it belongs to. As shown in Figure 4-14, the 
tag is a 30-byte header and CRC trailer that are added around the Fast Ethernet frame. This includes 
a 26-byte header and 4-byte CRC. The header includes a 15-bit VLAN ID that identiﬁes each 
VLAN. The user ﬁeld in the header also includes three bits for CoS.
Figure 4-14
ISL Frame
The IEEE 802.1Q standard trunks VLANs over Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, and 
you can use it in a multivendor environment. IEEE 802.1q uses one instance of STP for each VLAN 
allowed in the trunk. Like ISL, IEEE 802.1Q uses a tag on each frame with a VLAN identiﬁer. 
Figure 4-15 shows the IEEE 802.1Q frame. Unlike ISL, 802.1Q uses an internal tag. IEEE 802.1Q 
also provides support for the IEEE 802.1p priority standard, which is included in the 802.1D-1998 
speciﬁcation. A 3-bit priority ﬁeld is included in the 802.1Q frame for CoS.

IEEE 802.1Q Frame
The preferred location to mark trafﬁc is as close as possible to the source. Figure 4-16 shows a 
segment of a network with IP phones. Most workstations send packets with CoS or IP precedence 
bits (ToS) set to 0. If the workstation supports IEEE 802.1Q/p, it can mark packets. The IP phone 
can reclassify trafﬁc from the workstation to 0. VoIP trafﬁc from the phone is sent with a Layer 2 
CoS set to 5 or Layer 3 ToS set to 5. The phone also reclassiﬁes data from the PC to a CoS/ToS of 
0. With Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP), VoIP trafﬁc is set to Expedited Forwarding (EF), 
binary value 101110 (hexadecimal 2E).
As shown in Figure 4-16, switches capabilities vary in the access layer. If the switches in this layer 
are capable, conﬁgure them to accept the markings or remap them. The advanced switches in the 
distribution layer can mark trafﬁc, accept the CoS/ToS markings, or remap the CoS/ToS values to 
different markings.
Figure 4-16
Marking of Frames or Packets
Multicast Trafﬁc Considerations
The protocol between end workstations and the local Layer 3 switch is the IGMP. IGMP is the 
protocol used in multicast implementations between the end hosts and the local router. RFC 2236 
describes IGMP version 2 (IGMPv2). RFC 1112 describes the ﬁrst version of IGMP. IP hosts use 
IGMP to report their multicast group memberships to routers. IGMP messages use IP protocol 
number 2. IGMP messages are limited to the local interface and are not routed.

LAN Design Types and Models     103
When campus LANs use multicast media, end hosts that do not participate in multicast groups might 
get ﬂooded with unwanted trafﬁc. Two solutions are
I
CGMP
I
IGMP snooping
CGMP
CGMP is a Cisco proprietary protocol implemented to control multicast trafﬁc at Layer 2. Because 
a Layer 2 switch is not aware of Layer 3 IGMP messages, it cannot restrain multicast packets from 
being sent to all ports. 
As shown in Figure 4-17, with CGMP, the LAN switch can speak with the IGMP router to ﬁnd out 
the MAC addresses of the hosts that want to receive the multicast packets. You must also enable the 
router to speak CGMP with the LAN switches. With CGMP, switches distribute multicast sessions 
to the switch ports that have group members.
Figure 4-17
CGMP
When a CGMP-enabled router receives an IGMP report, it processes the report and then sends a 
CGMP message to the switch. The switch can then forward the multicast messages to the port 
with the host receiving multicast trafﬁc. CGMP Fast-Leave processing allows the switch to detect 
IGMP Version 2 leave messages sent by hosts on any of the supervisor engine module ports. When 
the IGMPv2 leave message is sent, the switch can then disable multicast for the port.

104     Chapter 4: LAN Design
IGMP Snooping
IGMP snooping is another way for switches to control multicast trafﬁc at Layer 2. They listen to 
IGMP messages between the hosts and routers. If a host sends an IGMP query message to the router, 
the switch adds the host to the multicast group and permits that port to receive multicast trafﬁc. The 
port is removed from multicast trafﬁc if an IGMP leave message is sent from the host to the router. 
The disadvantage of IGMP snooping is that it must listen to every IGMP control message, which 
can impact the CPU utilization of the switch.

Foundation Topics
This chapter introduces the various WAN technologies that a CCDA candidate should understand. 
In chapters that follow this one, you get more details regarding speciﬁc design considerations and 
WAN backup strategies that a network designer should know. 
After an introduction to WANs in general, this chapter details each speciﬁc WAN technology and 
discusses the groups that Cisco uses to categorize these technologies. Several tables assist you in 
ﬁnal-exam preparations. 
Introduction to Wide-Area Networking
WANs are a constantly evolving and necessary component within internetworks. Increasingly, 
today’s business environments require systems to disseminate greater amounts of information 
across wider geographical boundaries. Moreover, as the information transmitted across networks 
increases in complexity and time-sensitivity, WANs need greater bandwidths.
Before the CCDA can begin designing WAN solutions, popular WAN technology options must be 
understood. These include packet-, cell-, and circuit-switched technologies as well as dedicated 
leased-line connections. First, deﬁne a WAN.
What Is a WAN?
As the name implies, WANs encompass broad geographical areas. Unlike with LANs, private 
organizations that need the WAN services do not typically own the WAN. In most cases, the costs 
involved are too high, and sharing WAN resources across multiple organizations lessens the need to 
support multiple parallel private infrastructures, which reduces right-of-way issues and conﬂicts. 
Network providers most often supply connections through their systems and can even provide por-
tions of the hardware required. These network providers charge fees, or tariffs, for use of the WAN. 
Often set by governmental regulation, these fees can be a ﬁxed periodic amount independent of 
distance, duration of activity, or metered data volumes, as is typical of small ofﬁce/home ofﬁce 
(SOHO) Internet connectivity. These fees are also typically based on permanent or virtual circuits 
and some deﬁned relationship for guaranteed access bandwidth, as is common for packet-switched 
networks. Circuit-switched environments often use time of active connection. Leased-line environ-
ments frequently use an amount that considers access bandwidth and distance. As you will learn, it 
is important to consider all the aspects of these tariffs as you design appropriate WAN solutions.

116     Chapter 5: Wide-Area Networking Technologies
If the network providers are not actually supplying hardware to the organization, companies are 
almost certainly relying on network-provider switches or concentrators that relay information as it 
courses through the WAN. Typically, the organization does not know or care about the actual path 
data takes as it moves through the provider’s LAN. As long as the data reaches its destination 
(securely) in the timeframe expected, the provider can route the data as needed. 
For the most part, WAN technologies operate at the lowest three layers of the OSI model. These 
layers are the physical, data link, and network layers. Classic examples include X.25, which 
operates at Layers 2 and 3, and Frame Relay, which operates at Layer 2 only. 
Table 5-2 details key typical differences you should know when comparing LAN and WAN 
technologies.
WAN Categories
We often divide WAN technologies into categories that help deﬁne their nature. These categories are 
as follows:
I
Leased lines
I
Circuit-switched
I
Packet-switched
I
Cell-switched
Leased Lines
Networking professionals often refer to leased lines as point-to-point links. This text uses leased-
line terminology because of the frequency with which organizations actually lease these connec-
tions from a network or service provider. 
Leased lines are typically more reliable (and more expensive) when compared to the other WAN 
categories because they are completely reserved for transmissions and they are always available. 
Service providers reserve an entire physical circuit from the network access point to the customer 
premises. The circuit might be over-dedicated physical media or a channel maintained using fre-
quency modulation (FM) or time-division multiplexing (TDM). Synchronous serial connections are 
common examples of leased lines. Figure 5-1 shows a typical leased-line WAN connection.

Leased-Line WAN Connection
Circuit-Switched Lines
The classic example of a circuit-switched communications network is a typical voice telephone call 
over the PSTN. The call establishes a connection between the two end points and then terminates 
(or tears down) this connection when communications complete. Realize that with circuit-switched 
technologies, WAN equipment dedicates a physical path to the communications while they are 
occurring. No other participants can use the physical medium while communications continue. 
Classic examples of circuit-switched WAN technologies include ISDN and asynchronous serial 
connections. 
Packet-Switched Lines
Packet-switching technologies typically reduce costs to the organization because the service pro-
vider experiences a more efﬁcient use of its equipment. This efﬁciency is a result of customers shar-
ing the WAN resources in a way that allows the operator of the transport network to interleave trafﬁc 
from multiple sources to multiple destinations on links within the transport network. With packet 
switching, network equipment creates “virtual circuits” through the shared WAN provider’s net-
work. These virtual circuits transport the data (segmented as packets) through the WAN.
Virtual circuits are typically permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) or switched virtual circuits (SVCs). 
SVCs tend to have a lower cost for the organization, when available. They are appropriate when 
users transfer data sporadically over the WAN. With SVCs, network equipment builds connections 
on demand as needed, and these connections terminate when transmission completes. 
PVCs are permanently established connections. Obviously, these circuits are more appropriate for 
WAN environments where constant data transfers must take place. Although PVCs (which often 
guarantee bandwidth availability) tend to be more expensive, there is no overhead required with 
establishing connections, transferring data, and terminating connections, as with SVCs.
Packet-switching WAN technologies include X.25, Frame Relay, and SMDS, such as those shown 
in Figure 5-2.

Cell Switching 
With cell-switching WAN technology, the network divides data into units of a ﬁxed size called cells. 
The provider can transmit these ﬁxed size cells efﬁciently over a physical medium. ATM is an 
example of cell-switching technology.
WANs and the Enterprise Composite Network Model
Cisco built upon the classic hierarchical network model (access, distribution, core) to provide 
network designers with the Enterprise Composite Network model. The classic hierarchical model 
always suffered from scalability and manageability weaknesses. Cisco recommends use of the 
Enterprise Composite Network model to provide the functional components for network design. 
This model is aligned with the current Cisco “best practice” for building converged networks that 
provide security and other network services to support the transport of voice, video, and data. 
Figure 5-3 depicts the Enterprise Composite Network model.
Figure 5-3
Enterprise Composite Network Model
It is interesting to note that this model does not abandon the hierarchical model but rather adopts 
hierarchy separately within the enterprise campus to meet the specialized needs for user access; for 
access to application servers; and for access to or from remote users, sites, and external networks.

Initial feedback from network designers regarding the new model has been positive. Network 
architects can focus on a “divide-and-conquer” approach in which they concentrate on each block 
of the model and the relationships between them. Designers divide the network into functional areas 
and focus their efforts more effectively to meet the business needs of their organizations.
Where do WAN technologies ﬁt in the Enterprise Composite Network model? They operate between 
the Enterprise Edge and the SP Edge using the various technologies in this chapter. 
Wide-Area Networking Technologies
Today, there are many technologies available for designing WAN infrastructures. Constant research 
and development in the area of WAN technologies allows designers to implement increasingly cost-
effective WAN designs that take advantage of new mechanisms such as metropolitan Ethernet and 
virtual private networks (VPNs) using cable and DSL for access. You should acquire a solid com-
prehension of the technology options available before designing WAN solutions.
Dial-Up
The ﬁrst of the WAN technologies presented here is one that many readers have used at some point, 
dial-up. Dial-up refers to the use of a modem connected to the PSTN to carry data. Although the 
available bandwidth is lowest with this technology (transmissions of just 53 Kbps are possible with 
current V.90 standards), it is still a popular remote-access choice for home ofﬁce and telecommuter 
environments—because of low costs and almost universal availability. Users can easily achieve dial-
up wide-area networking through the acquisition of inexpensive customer premises equipment 
(CPE) such as the digital modem. 
Dial-up WAN services have managed a presence in more than just the home-ofﬁce environment, in 
part because of dial-on-demand routing (DDR) capabilities built in to most Cisco devices. DDR 
enables networking equipment to dynamically dial a connection to a remote WAN destination upon 
the receipt of “interesting” trafﬁc. Of course, it is up to the Cisco administrator to determine and 
deﬁne these interesting trafﬁc patterns. 
Chapter 7, “Backup Options and Sample WAN Designs,” details yet another powerful reason why 
dial-up solutions continue to appear in WAN designs today—WAN backup options.
ISDN
Regional telephone carriers make ISDN a WAN design possibility for many internetwork WAN 
designs. ISDN permits the digitization of access to the telephone network so that existing phone 
lines are capable of carrying data in a digital form rather than as analog signals. 

120     Chapter 5: Wide-Area Networking Technologies
It is important that network designers understand the devices and reference points in an ISDN WAN. 
We refer to ISDN terminals that are “ISDN ready” as terminal equipment type 1 (TE1s), whereas 
non-ISDN terminals are TE2s. To connect a TE2 device to the ISDN network, use a terminal adapter 
(TA). TE1 and TE2 devices connect to network termination type 1 (NT1) or network termination 
type 2 (NT2) devices. These devices connect the four-wire subscriber wiring to the two-wire local-
loop provider network. In North America, the NT1 is a customer-provided CPE device, whereas in 
most other parts of the world, this device is part of the carrier’s network. NT2s are more complicated 
devices usually found as components in PBXs. They typically provide Layer 2 and 3 protocol 
functions and concentration services. 
The key reference points within an ISDN network are deﬁned in the ISDN standards produced by 
the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T). 
The R reference point identiﬁes the area between non-ISDN equipment and the TA. The S reference 
point identiﬁes the area between user terminals and the NT2. The T reference point identiﬁes the 
area between the NT1 and NT2 devices. Finally, the U reference point identiﬁes the area between 
the NT1 devices and line-termination equipment in the carrier network. Obviously, the U reference 
point is relevant only to ISDN subscribers in North America. Figure 5-4 depicts TE1 and TE2 
devices and their respective connections to the ISDN switch with the respective reference points.
Figure 5-4
ISDN Devices and Reference Points
The two types of ISDN services are Basic Rate Interface (BRI) and Primary Rate Interface (PRI).
BRI
ISDN BRI offers two bearer (B) channels and a single delta (D) channel. BRI B channels transmit 
data and operate at 64 Kbps. The BRI D channel handles signaling and operates at 16 Kbps. BRI 
also provides for framing control and other overhead, thus bringing the total bit rate to 192 Kbps.

PRI
In North America and Japan, PRI ISDN over T1 media provides 23 B channels and 1 D channel. 
Unlike BRI, the D channel in PRI operates at 64 Kbps as well, bringing the total bit rate to 
1.544 Mbps. In Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world, PRI is provisioned over E1 
media and features 30 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel for a total bit rate of 2.048 Mbps.
X.25
X.25 is an ITU-T WAN protocol. Frame Relay has helped make X.25 mainly a legacy WAN tech-
nology, especially in North America. X.25 was designed to operate effectively even over links with 
relatively high bit-error rates. The packet-switched networks of common carriers have used it. X.25 
features high overhead due to built-in error detection and recovery mechanisms. Frame Relay, on 
the other hand, takes advantage of today’s more reliable physical connections and leaves such error 
recovery to upper layers of the OSI model. The bandwidth saved is available for other uses.
X.25 WAN devices include data terminal equipment (DTE), data circuit-terminating equipment 
(DCE), and packet-switching exchange (PSE). DTE devices are end systems that communicate 
across the X.25 network. They might include your actual workstations or other network hosts. DCE 
devices are communications devices, such as modems and packet switches, that provide the inter-
face between DTE devices and a PSE. DCE devices are generally located in the carrier’s facilities. 
PSEs are switches that compose the bulk of the carrier’s network. They transfer data from one DTE 
device to another through the X.25 PSN.
The packet assembler/disassembler (PAD) is a common device in X.25 networks. X.25 relies upon 
PADs when an end device cannot implement the full X.25 functionality. The PAD is located between 
the end device and a DCE device. The PAD performs three primary functions: buffering, packet 
assembly, and packet disassembly. 
X.25 WAN technology maps to the lowest three layers of the OSI reference model. X.25 implemen-
tations typically use the following protocols: Packet-Layer Protocol (PLP); Link Access Procedure, 
Balanced (LAPB); and a variety of physical-layer protocols (such as EIA/TIA-232, EIA/TIA-449, 
EIA/TIA-530, and G.703).
X.25 supports both SVCs and PVCs. The basic operation of an X.25 virtual circuit begins when the 
source DTE device speciﬁes the virtual circuit to be used (in the packet headers) and then sends the 
packets to a locally connected DCE device. The local DCE device examines the packet headers to 
determine which virtual circuit to use and then sends the packets to the closest switch in the path of 
that virtual circuit. The switches pass the trafﬁc to the next intermediate node in the path, which can 
be another switch or the remote DCE device. The remote DCE device examines the packet headers 
and determines the destination address. This DCE device then sends the packets to the destination 
DTE device. If communication occurs over an SVC and neither device has additional data to 
transfer, the virtual circuit terminates.

122     Chapter 5: Wide-Area Networking Technologies
Although PVCs are more common with Frame Relay, SVCs are more common with X.25 imple-
mentations. Also, X.25 requires special addressing. Speciﬁcally, X.25 uses X.121 addresses in call 
setup mode to establish SVCs. The X.121 address ﬁeld includes the International Data Number 
(IDN), which consists of two ﬁelds: the Data Network Identiﬁcation Code (DNIC) and the National 
Terminal Number (NTN). The DNIC is an optional ﬁeld that identiﬁes the exact PSN in which the 
destination DTE device is located. X.25 sometimes omits the DNIC in calls within the same PSN. 
The DNIC has two subﬁelds: country and PSN. The country subﬁeld speciﬁes the country where the 
destination PSN is located. The PSN ﬁeld speciﬁes the exact PSN in which the destination DTE 
device is located. Finally, the NTN identiﬁes the exact DTE device in the PSN for which a packet is 
destined. This ﬁeld varies in length.
Frame Relay
Many network designers consider Frame Relay a streamlined version of X.25. This analogy holds 
true on several different levels. It is certainly appropriate to label the protocol as streamlined because 
it does not involve the intense error recovery that occurs with X.25. Frame Relay restricts its oper-
ations to the lower two layers of the OSI model and allows higher-level protocols to concern them-
selves with transmission errors.
Frame Relay’s designers originally intended the protocol for use across ISDN interfaces. Today, 
Frame Relay transmissions occur over a variety of other network interfaces as well.
Like X.25, Frame Relay networks rely upon DCE and DTE devices. They also rely upon virtual 
circuits for the actual transmission of data through the WAN network. These can be SVCs or PVCs, 
yet Frame Relay PVCs are more common—many carriers do not even provide the option of SVC 
conﬁgurations. 
Although X.25 uses X.121 addresses for circuit identiﬁcation, Frame Relay uses a new concept 
called data-link connection identiﬁers (DLCIs). Frame Relay service providers typically assign 
these values, and they have only local signiﬁcance. Their values are unique in the LAN but not 
necessarily in the Frame Relay WAN.
Frame Relay reduces network overhead by implementing simple congestion-notiﬁcation mecha-
nisms rather than enforcing explicit per-virtual-circuit ﬂow control. Speciﬁcally, Frame Relay 
implements two congestion-notiﬁcation mechanisms, forward-explicit congestion notiﬁcations 
(FECNs) and backward-explicit congestion notiﬁcations (BECNs). 
Discard Eligibility
Frame Relay also uses a Discard Eligibility (DE) bit to indicate that a frame has a greater probability 
of loss by discard than other frames. The DE bit is part of the address ﬁeld in the Frame Relay frame 
header. DTE devices can set the value of the DE bit of a frame to 1 to indicate that the frame has 

Wide-Area Networking Technologies     123
lower importance than other frames. The DE bit can also be set at the edge of a Frame Relay network 
to mark packets that are not compliant with the service contract. When the network becomes con-
gested, DCE devices discard frames with the DE bit set before discarding those without. This clever 
method of congestion management helps to ensure that DCEs do not drop critical data. 
Local Management Interface
Another important feature of Frame Relay is Local Management Interface (LMI). LMI is a set 
of enhancements to the basic Frame Relay speciﬁcation. Cisco Systems, StrataCom, Northern 
Telecom, and Digital Equipment Corporation developed the new enhancements in 1990. LMI offers 
a number of features (called extensions) for managing complex internetworks. These extensions 
include global addressing, virtual-circuit status messages, and multicasting.
SMDS
SMDS is a high-speed, packet-switched, datagram-based WAN technology used for communication 
over public data networks (PDNs). SMDS uses ﬁber- or copper-based media and supports speeds of 
1.544 Mbps over Digital Signal Level 1 (DS-1) transmission facilities or 44.736 Mbps over Digital 
Signal Level 3 (DS-3) transmission facilities. In addition, SMDS data units are large enough to 
encapsulate entire IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.5, and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) frames. 
A typical SMDS network consists of several underlying devices to provide high-speed data service. 
These devices include CPE, carrier equipment, and the subscriber network interface (SNI). The CPE 
is terminal equipment typically owned and maintained by the customer. The CPE includes end 
devices, such as terminals and personal computers, and intermediate nodes, such as routers, 
modems, and multiplexers. The SMDS carrier, however, sometimes provides intermediate nodes. 
Carrier equipment generally consists of high-speed WAN switches that must conform to certain 
network equipment speciﬁcations, such as those outlined by Bell Communications Research 
(Bellcore). These speciﬁcations deﬁne network operations, the interface between a local-carrier 
network and a long-distance carrier network, and the interface between two switches inside a single-
carrier network. 
Notice that the SNI is the interface between the CPE and carrier equipment. This interface is the 
point at which the customer network ends and the carrier network begins. The function of the SNI 
is to render the technology and operation of the carrier SMDS network transparent to the customer. 
SMDS uses the SMDS Interface Protocol (SIP) for communications between CPE and SMDS 
carrier equipment. SIP provides connectionless service across the SNI, allowing the CPE to access 
the SMDS network. SIP derives its origins from the IEEE 802.6 Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) 
standard for cell relay across metropolitan-area networks (MANs). DQDB is a perfect basis for SIP 
because it is an open standard that supports all the SMDS service features. 

124     Chapter 5: Wide-Area Networking Technologies
SMDS protocol data units (PDUs) carry both a source and a destination address. SMDS addresses 
are 10-digit values resembling conventional telephone numbers. The SMDS addressing implemen-
tation offers group addressing and security features. SMDS group addresses allow a single address 
to refer to multiple CPE stations, which specify the group address in the destination-address ﬁeld of 
the PDU. The network makes multiple copies of the PDU and delivers these packets to all members 
of the group. Group addresses reduce the amount of network resources required for distributing 
routing information, resolving addresses, and dynamically discovering network resources. SMDS 
group addressing is analogous to multicasting on LANs. 
SMDS implements two security features: source-address validation and address screening. Source-
address validation ensures that the PDU source address is legitimate and represents the true SNI 
from which it originated. Source-address validation prevents address spooﬁng, in which illegal 
trafﬁc assumes the source address of a legitimate device. Address screening allows a subscriber to 
establish a private virtual network that excludes unwanted trafﬁc.
Asynchronous Transfer Mode
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is an ITU-T standard for cell relay. ATM was developed to 
provide converged services for voice, video, and data with better performance characteristics than 
provided by traditional packet-switched technologies. ATM transmits information in small, ﬁxed-
size cells. ATM networks are connection-oriented.
ATM is a cell-switching and multiplexing technology that combines the beneﬁts of circuit switching 
(guaranteed capacity and constant transmission delay) with those of packet switching (ﬂexibility 
and efﬁciency for intermittent trafﬁc). It provides scalable bandwidth from a few megabits per 
second (Mbps) to many gigabits per second (Gbps). 
ATM Cells
ATM cells consist of 53 octets, or bytes. The ﬁrst 5 bytes contain cell-header information, and the 
remaining 48 contain the payload (user information). Small, ﬁxed-length cells are well suited to 
transferring voice and video trafﬁc because such trafﬁc is intolerant of the serialization delay 
incurred by any large data packet that might precede it in an output queue.
ATM Networks
An ATM network consists of a set of ATM switches interconnected by point-to-point ATM links or 
interfaces. ATM switches support two primary types of interfaces: User-Network Interface (UNI) 
and Network Node Interface (NNI). A UNI connects an ATM end system (such as hosts and routers) 
and a private ATM switch or a private ATM switch and the public-carrier ATM network switch node. 
An NNI connects two network nodes.

Wide-Area Networking Technologies     125
ATM networks are connection-oriented, which means that a virtual channel (VC) exists across 
the ATM network prior to any data transfer. A virtual channel is much like the virtual circuits used 
by other technologies explored in this chapter. 
ATM Connections
The two types of ATM connections are virtual paths and virtual channels. A virtual path is a bundle 
of virtual channels that is identiﬁed by a virtual path identiﬁer (VPI) on a particular interface. In a 
virtual path connection, the trafﬁc is switched through a network node based only on the interface 
and VPI received. A virtual channel is a speciﬁc connection through the ATM network. Within any 
one virtual path, the virtual channel is identiﬁed by a virtual channel identiﬁer (VCI). In a virtual 
channel connection, the trafﬁc is switched through a network node based on the interface and VPI 
and VCI received. The VPI and VCI values are local to a particular link between two ATM switches 
or an ATM switch and an end system.
Additional WAN Technologies
In addition to the more widely deployed WAN technologies explored in this section, there are 
several technologies with increasing visibility for WAN access and transport. Access technologies 
include DSL, cable, and LRE. Wireless provides WAN connectivity where it is expensive, imprac-
tical, or impossible to build a cabled infrastructure. 
DSL 
DSL technology is a modem technology that uses existing twisted-pair, local-loop telephone lines 
to transport high-bandwidth data, such as multimedia and video, to service subscribers. The term 
xDSL covers a number of similar, yet competing, forms of DSL technologies, including ADSL 
(asymmetric), SDSL (single-line), HDSL (high-data-rate), HDSL-2, G.SHDL (multirate high-data-
rate), IDSL (ISDN), and VDSL (very-high-data-rate). xDSL is drawing signiﬁcant attention from 
network designers because it delivers high-bandwidth data rates to dispersed locations with rela-
tively small changes to the existing telco infrastructure. Currently, most DSL deployments are 
ADSL, mainly delivered to residential customers.
ADSL technology provides asymmetric data rates. It allows more bandwidth downstream—from a 
Network Service Provider’s (NSP’s) central ofﬁce to the customer site—than upstream from the 
subscriber to the central ofﬁce. This asymmetry, combined with always-on access (which eliminates 
call setup), makes ADSL ideal for Web surﬁng, video-on-demand, and remote access, usually using 
a VPN connection. Users of these applications typically download much more information than they 
send. ADSL can transmit more than 6 Mbps to a subscriber and as much as 640 Kbps more in both 
directions. Such rates expand existing access capacity by a factor of 50 or more as compared to 
analog modem access without new cabling. 

126     Chapter 5: Wide-Area Networking Technologies
ADSL depends on advanced digital-signal processing and algorithms to transmit large amounts of 
information through twisted-pair telephone lines. To create multiple channels, ADSL modems 
divide the available bandwidth of a telephone line in one of two ways: frequency-division multi-
plexing (FDM) or echo cancellation. FDM assigns one band for upstream data and another band for 
downstream data. TDM divides the downstream path into one or more high-speed channels and one 
or more low-speed channels. It occurs with the upstream path as well for low-speed channels. Echo 
cancellation assigns the upstream band to overlap the downstream and separates the two by means 
of local echo cancellation, a technique well known in V.32 and V.34 modems. With either technique, 
ADSL splits off a 4 kHz region for basic telephone service at the lower end of the frequency range.
LRE 
LRE or Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) broadband networking technology uses Ethernet technol-
ogy to deliver 5-15 Mbps performance over existing telephone-grade (Category 1/2/3) wiring. LRE 
reaches up to 5000 feet and enables simultaneous voice, video, and data applications. This technol-
ogy actually makes use of DSL coding and digital-modulation techniques with Ethernet framing.
LRE provides a cost-effective, easy-to-deploy technology for service providers and facility opera-
tors to use in existing multi-unit buildings (MxU) and enterprise-campus environments with broad-
band access. MxU buildings include hotels, multidwelling unit (MDU) housing, and multitenant 
unit (MTU) ofﬁce buildings. 
Cable
Cable is an expanding new technology option for data transport that uses a hybrid of coaxial cable 
and ﬁber-optic media over cable distribution systems. Although this WAN technology was at ﬁrst 
hampered by a lack of formal standardization, a newly introduced standard, the Data Over Cable 
Service Interface Speciﬁcation (DOCSIS) 1.0 has found wide North American acceptance as a 
method to serve homes and small ofﬁces. Remote access to enterprises usually uses a VPN connec-
tion. DOCSIS 1.1 is currently in development for the purpose of supporting Voice over IP (VoIP) 
and advanced security.
The DOCSIS interface speciﬁcations enabled the development and deployment of data-over-cable 
systems on a nonproprietary, multivendor, interoperable basis for transparent bidirectional transfer 
of IP trafﬁc between the cable system head end and customer locations over an all-coaxial or hybrid-
ﬁber/coax (HFC) cable network. The system consists of a Cable Modem Terminating System 
(CMTS) at the head end, a coaxial or HFC medium, and a cable modem at the premises of the 
customer, in conjunction with DOCSIS-deﬁned layers that support interoperability and evolutionary 
feature capabilities.

Wide-Area Networking Technologies     127
From a design perspective, cable is an attractive WAN access technology where cable television is 
widely deployed.
Wireless 
Wireless is an exciting area of telecommunications that uses electromagnetic waves for data trans-
port instead of wire or glass ﬁbers. Current examples of wireless equipment include cellular phones, 
pagers, global positioning services (GPSs), cordless computer peripherals, satellite television, and 
wireless LANs. 
Currently, many types of wireless technologies exist, containing a large number of subset technol-
ogies that range from ATM-based to wireless LAN facilities. Wireless frequencies of the different 
technologies travel between several hundred feet (wireless LAN) and 25 miles (Multichannel 
Multipoint Distribution Service [MMDS]). 
These different wireless technologies are each unique because of their protocols (ATM or IP), their 
connection types (p2p or p2mp), and their spectrums (licensed or unlicensed).
Multiprotocol Label Switching
Another exciting WAN technology option is Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), which features 
a converged network infrastructure that is already replacing some Frame Relay and ATM networks. 
Due to MPLS, service providers have the ability to provide traditional WAN services and beyond at 
a fraction of the cost of other WAN technologies. These additional services include trafﬁc 
engineering, QoS, Layer 2 Tunneling, and virtual private network (VPN) services over IP. 
MPLS functions by encapsulating packets as they arrive at the Service Provider Edge network. 
Packets are “tagged” by this encapsulation to indicate the destination network. Core MPLS routers 
in the service provider network apply appropriate services based on the label and also forward the 
packet appropriately based on this special tag information. The MPLS encapsulated information is 
stripped from the packet upon exciting the service provider network. 
MPLS relies upon several equipment types in order to achieve its technology as well as an important 
protocol. Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is the network equipment at a customer location, 
while Edge Label Switch Routers (ELSRs) are located at the ingress point of the service provider 
network. As its name implies, this equipment is used to assign (remove) labels to packets as they 
arrive (exit) at the provider. Cisco high-end switches or routers function as the ELSR equipment. 
Label Switch Routers (LSRs) are located at the core of the MPLS network and are critical for 
forwarding and trafﬁc engineering functions as they pass MPLS packets at a high rate of speed. 
The Label Distribution Protocol (LSR) is responsible for distributing label information throughout 
the network.

128     Chapter 5: Wide-Area Networking Technologies
MPLS devices use Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) to make forwarding decisions. FECs 
are responsible for maintaining and communicating the relationship between labels and paths 
throughout the network.
Because MPLS offers exciting and efﬁcient methods for forwarding many different types of trafﬁc 
with varying network service needs, MPLS should see more implementations soon.

Foundation Summary     129
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
WANs encompass broad geographical areas, and the organizations that use them do not typically 
own the equipment or media that connects the equipment. Network providers most often supply 
connections through their systems and might even provide portions of the hardware required. These 
network providers charge fees, or tariffs, for use of the WAN. It is very important that you consider 
all aspects of these tariffs as you design appropriate WAN solutions. For the most part, WAN 
technologies operate at the lowest three layers of the OSI model. 
Designers typically divide WAN technologies into four categories: leased lines, circuit-switched, 
packet-switched, and cell-switched. Leased lines are point-to-point links. Leased lines are typically 
more reliable (and more expensive) because they are completely reserved for transmissions, and 
they are always available. An example of a circuit-switched communications network is a typical 
voice telephone call over the PSTN. The call establishes a connection between the two end points 
and then terminates this connection when communications complete. Packet-switching technologies 
typically reduce costs to the organization because they use the service provider’s equipment more 
efﬁciently, a result of customers sharing the WAN resources. With packet switching, the network 
creates “virtual circuits” through the shared WAN provider’s network. These virtual circuits 
transport the data (segmented as packets) through the WAN. With cell-switching WAN technology, 
the network divides data into units of ﬁxed-size chunks called cells. The provider can transmit these 
ﬁxed-size cells efﬁciently over a physical medium. ATM is the best example of cell-switching 
technology.
WAN technologies ﬁt nicely into the Enterprise Composite Network model. They operate between 
the Enterprise Edge and the SP Edge using the various Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies in this 
chapter.

Foundation Topics
A network designer should follow a clear-cut process when designing a completely new network—
or the more common occurrence—redesigning an existing network. This section assists you with a 
network-design challenge and focuses on redesigning an existing network. Perhaps, this redesign is 
necessary because you must support a new application or network service or because the existing 
network cannot support current applications or bandwidth requirements. Whatever the reason, the 
concepts in this section assist you in creating a well-planned, fully functional WAN design.
Analyze, Characterize, Design
Designing the perfect WAN solution for a client involves a careful process. Although there are many 
possible approaches, Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of requirements, 
characterization of the existing network, and design of the new WAN topology—at the very least. 
Although it might sound like a lot of work (and if done properly, it is), keep in mind that some design 
engagements make it simpler because there is no existing network to begin with! 
First, network designers must engage in a careful analysis of the requirements for the network. For 
an existing network, chances are that business conditions or goals have changed and the network 
must meet new demands. For example, many organizations are incorporating Voice over IP (VoIP) 
solutions to save money and consolidate technologies. This major change in a network almost 
certainly increases and expands the demands placed upon the WAN. A designer should also look 
as far into the future as possible during this phase, satisfying current requirements and as many 
upcoming requirements as possible.
The second step in the process is important as well. This step involves a careful analysis of the 
existing network infrastructure. Not only should a designer carefully document the existing WAN, 
but he should also focus on the existing WAN’s ease of migration to the new design. Can existing 
network equipment satisfy the new infrastructure requirements? Can the existing infrastructure 
support new sites? What about the new planned features?
Finally, the network designer must document fully the new proposed network. Obviously, this 
document should fully describe how the new design meets the technology goals of the organization 
and how, in turn, the technology of the organization meets the business goals of the organization. 
Wherever possible, the designer should note the exact service levels possible with the new design.

140     Chapter 6: Designing Wide-Area Networking Solutions
Common Design Factors
Although network designers should consider many potential design factors before documenting 
their proposed solutions, Cisco recommends three main categories. Designers should scrutinize the 
following when designing WAN solutions: 
I
Application factors
I
Technical factors 
I
Cost factors
Application Factors
Application access is an important factor in modern WAN designs. Almost all network users must 
access remote applications at some point in their use of the network. This access becomes an even 
bigger factor as organizations rely more on distributed application platforms. For example, an 
organization might rely heavily on an SQL Server installation that is located in a data center in a 
remote region of the business’s geography. The most important components in this or any other 
design example regarding application access are response time, throughput, and reliability. 
Response Time
Response time is a powerful component of application-design criteria. Response time is a simple and 
often accurate measure of design success or failure. Simply stated, response time is the time between 
the entry of a command or data at a source system and the target system’s execution of the command 
or the target’s response.
Perhaps, response time is such a key measurement because end users of the network are so aware of 
its value. Nothing in the network warrants more satisfaction-level discussions than slow response 
times. 
Two speciﬁc components of response time are delay and jitter. The ever-increasing amount of voice 
and video make these measures more critical due to their effect on the quality of the received real-
time content. They are typically measured in only one direction, unlike response time. With data 
trafﬁc, delay contributes directly to response time. In a voice conversation, excessive delay can force 
a style of communication where one side talks and the other only listens until the roles are explicitly 
reversed. Jitter is the experienced variation in delay. Digital voice circuits use dejitter buffers to 
change this random variable delay to a more tolerable ﬁxed delay. Excessive jitter can lead to gaps 
TIP
Remember that the network designer should prepare detailed design documents while 
progressing through the new or revised network design. A common design document in this phase 
would detail the applications running in the environment and key characteristics about them. 

Common Design Factors     141
in the signal stream as trafﬁc is delayed and the dejitter buffer empties or lost conversation if trafﬁc 
bursts and overﬂows the dejitter buffer. Streaming video has the same sensitivities and far larger data 
streams.
Table 6-2 demonstrates that different types of applications feature different levels of tolerance for 
slow response times.
The components of delay can be ﬁxed or variable. For a given path through a network, the ﬁxed costs 
include distance latency, serialization delay, and switching delay. Queuing delays at intermediate 
devices are the source of delay variation. The dejitter buffers at the edge of the network ﬁx the vari-
able delay. In a connectionless packet network, changes in the path through the network can also 
change the delay experienced during an exchange. A reasonable estimate for distance latency is 6 ms 
per 1000 km or 10 ms per 1000 miles. For planning a delay budget, you can expect each switch in 
the path to add 10 ms to the experienced one-way delay for switching and serialization. Both esti-
mates are intentionally a bit high to allow for the unexpected.
Throughput
Another key factor regarding application considerations is throughput. Of course, throughput is 
the amount of data transferred in a portion of the network during a speciﬁc time interval. Again, 
different applications place different throughput demands on the network. For example, data-ﬁle 
transfer applications force the need for higher throughput even though response-time requirements 
are lesser. Obviously, network designers and implementers need to schedule the heavy use of 
throughput-intensive applications for periods of time when the network is not also using response-
time–sensitive applications to a high degree. 
If an application requires more throughput than a WAN design can deliver, packet loss can result. 
This packet loss is due to the ﬁlling of queues within the devices that attach to the media. Another 
source of packet loss is the discard of packets damaged in transit by media and signal-path device 
errors. Damaged packets are typically discarded as discovered. In the telecommunications network-
ing world, this loss is measured as bit-error rate (BER). The BER is the percentage of bits that have 
errors relative to the total number of bits received. Designers usually express BER as 10 to a negative 
power. For example, a BER of 10 to the minus 6 indicates 1 bit out of 1,000,000 was transmitted in 
error. Obviously, high BER measurements for a WAN are a bad sign. One potential solution in such

a situation is to slow the transmission rate of data over the WAN, thus reducing the throughput the 
WAN network can support. Table 6-3 details the throughput requirements for a single instance of 
typical application categories.
Reliability
Reliability for applications in the network is a measure of how often the application is available 
when network users attempt to access it. Designers refer to the amount of time an application is 
unavailable in the network as downtime. Obviously, the less downtime for an application, the better, 
but some mission-critical applications must offer the highest possible reliability ratings. A common 
reference to this level of reliability is ﬁve 9s. It indicates the application is available 99.999 percent 
of the time. Designers should consider redundancy in the WAN design when they must support these 
applications. Redundant WAN designs are a topic of Chapter 7. Designers should also analyze and 
determine the costs associated with an organization for downtime in an application. Doing so allows 
an organization to accurately measure the costs that are justiﬁable for WAN implementations. 
Table 6-4 details reliability requirements over different application categories. Designers should 
realize that the table is irrelevant when considering mission-critical applications; they all require the 
highest availability ratings possible.
What makes designing a WAN to support application trafﬁc such a difﬁcult job for designers is that 
network users are looking for the best possible response times, yet WAN designers are looking for 
an effective use of the available bandwidth for a link. Designers want to see the investment in the 
WAN connectivity pay off for the organization. This payoff means that network users use the WAN 
link to a high percentage. Obviously, these goals often collide. Too high a link utilization can cause 
data response times to suffer due to the retransmission of dropped packets and the quality of 
interactive voice and video to fall dramatically.
Remember, Cisco recommends 50 percent average link utilization as a “sweet spot.” This level 
justiﬁes the purchase of WAN bandwidth while also producing adequate response times for network

users. A 50 percent link utilization allows increases in usage during more active times to reach 
60 percent, still an acceptable value. Cisco states that 75 percent link utilization typically signals the 
need for an immediate WAN link upgrade. 
Technical Factors
By far, the biggest technical factor when a designer focuses on the WAN is bandwidth. Table 6-5 
presents typical bandwidths possible given the use of particular technologies.
Bandwidth requirements are directly proportional to the amount of data users must transmit on the 
network. It does vary with the complexity of the data. Electronic images, sound ﬁles, and other 
multimedia-based data ﬁles require more bandwidth than the transmission of standard text ﬁles, for 
example. 
Obviously, designers face fewer challenges in the LAN design regarding bandwidth. With new 
advances in Ethernet technologies, including Ethernet switching, data transfers can take place at 
what Cisco and others call “wire speeds”—meaning the full bandwidth capacity of the Ethernet 
channels. It can be up to 10 Gbps and even greater! In WAN designs, Table 6-5 places much greater 
constraints on the bandwidths possible.

144     Chapter 6: Designing Wide-Area Networking Solutions
Cost Factors
As this chapter and others have already mentioned, costs are a major factor for WAN designers to 
consider. In fact, a refresher in a college-level accounting class could come in handy. Designers 
should note ﬁxed costs and recurring variable costs in most WAN designs. Fixed costs include the 
following:
I
Equipment purchases—Includes modems, channel service units and data service units (CSU 
and DSUs), routers and router interfaces, distribution layer switches and modules 
I
Circuit-provisioning—Includes charges for establishing virtual circuits through the 
provider WAN
I
Network-management tools and platforms—Includes monitoring and management 
applications such as CiscoWorks or OpenView
Recurring and often variable costs include the monthly circuit fees from service providers and WAN 
support and maintenance costs. They might even include any network-management center person-
nel. As you might guess, these costs tend to vary with the utilization levels of the WAN options. 
Remember, from an ownership perspective of the WAN design, the three broad categories are 
private, leased, and shared. 
Privately Owned WAN Designs
If only all WAN designers had unlimited budgets from which to draw. These designers could rec-
ommend solutions that incorporate fully private-owned systems and reap immediate performance 
and security beneﬁts. With privately owned WAN designs, organizations would purchase all the 
physical layer media (copper, ﬁber, wireless, coaxial) and the terminal equipment that connects it. 
Obviously, most organizations ﬁnd this arrangement cost-prohibitive—most organizations would 
not possess the expertise and manpower to maintain such a design to begin with. 
Leased WAN Designs
Leased WAN arrangements involve dedicated bandwidth leased to the organization by a service 
provider. The organization leases the terminal equipment involved in the WAN connectivity, or it 
purchases the equipment for private ownership. Because the organization must pay for the dedicated 
level of bandwidth (whether this bandwidth is actually used or not), costs tend to be higher with 
leased connections. 
Shared WAN Designs
Shared WAN approaches tend to be the most economical for organizations. Under this arrangement, 
many companies share the bandwidth that the provider has available. Obviously, organizations must 
make some sacriﬁces in the areas of performance and security with this arrangement. It is up to the 

WAN Performance Options     145
designer to ensure that these sacriﬁces do not outweigh the cost savings. As this book detailed in 
Chapter 5, “Wide-Area Networking Technologies,” many technologies such as cell or packet 
switching can ensure that “private” connections persist through the shared WAN media.
WAN Performance Options
Cisco Systems builds many options for improving the performance of a WAN design right into the 
WAN equipment. This improvement is possible thanks to the intelligence built into the operating 
systems that power the network equipment. Any network designer should be familiar with the 
options for improving WAN link performance included in the operating-system features. Although 
the feature set varies from operating system to operating system, you must have a thorough 
understanding of all mechanisms. 
Data Compression
The job of data compression is to reduce the size of data before transmitting it over the WAN con-
nection. This compression conserves WAN bandwidth at the costs of increased delay and greater 
terminal equipment costs for software feature sets and optional hardware accelerators. Cisco IOS 
Software can compress the entire packet before transmission or compress the header or the payload. 
Cisco IOS Software supports many options for data compression, including the following technol-
ogies described here.
FRF.9 Frame Relay Payload Compression
FRF.9 Frame Relay payload compression deﬁnes data compression over Frame Relay using the 
Data Compression Protocol (DCP). The compression operates with both switched virtual circuits 
(SVCs) and permanent virtual circuits (PVCs). Network equipment negotiates the compression 
usage at the time the Frame Relay data-link connection identiﬁer (DLCI) initiates. The Frame Relay 
network transports the compressed payload through the WAN and decompresses the data at its 
termination point. Thus, FRF.9 is point-to-point or end-to-end technology.
LAPB Payload Compression Using LZS
Designers often refer to this compression as simply Storage Allocation and Coding Program (STAC) 
or Predictor. In fact, STAC Incorporated developed and marketed this data-compression standard for 
WAN connections—especially Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connections. Many Cisco routers 
support the method, including most ISDN-capable routers. 
HDLC Using LZS
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) WAN encapsulations combine with LZS compression 
technologies.

146     Chapter 6: Designing Wide-Area Networking Solutions
X.25 Payload Compression of Encapsulated Trafﬁc 
Many Cisco routers support payload compression for X.25. Unlike link compression, only the 
packet’s payload (and not its header) receives compression by the equipment.

The Predictor compression algorithm tries to predict the next sequence of characters in a data stream 
by using an index to look up a sequence in the compression dictionary. It then examines the next 
sequence in the data stream to see whether it matches. If it does, that sequence replaces the looked-
up sequence in the dictionary. If there is no match, the algorithm locates the next character sequence 
in the index, and the process begins again. The index updates itself by hashing a few of the most 
recent character sequences from the input stream.
Van Jacobson Header Compression for TCP/IP
Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression reduces the size of the TCP/IP headers to as few as three 
bytes. It can make a signiﬁcant improvement on slow serial lines, particularly for interactive trafﬁc. 
This compression uses the IP-Compression-Protocol conﬁguration option to indicate the ability to 
receive compressed packets. Each end of the link must separately request this option if bidirectional 
compression is the desired effect.
MPPC
MPPC is a scheme used to compress PPP packets between Cisco and Microsoft client devices. The 
companies designed the MPPC algorithm to optimize bandwidth utilization to support multiple 
simultaneous connections. The MPPC algorithm uses a Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm with a 
continuous history buffer (dictionary).
Designers often view compression as a “magic pill” that should be immediately prescribed for WAN 
designs. This belief could not be further from the truth. It is often inappropriate for WAN devices. 
For example, Cisco recommends that designers avoid compression usage if network-equipment 
CPU utilization levels are at 65  percent or greater.
Window Size
Another WAN performance factor is TCP window size. The term window size refers to the amount 
of data a device sends on the network before requiring the receipt of an acknowledgment. Acknowl-
edgments occur in reliable protocols to indicate the data actually reached its destination. TCP relies 
upon these acknowledgments and a window size to ensure the proper end-to-end delivery of data 
packets. 
Designers deﬁne window size using frames or bytes depending upon the protocol in question. TCP 
uses bytes as the window-size measurement. 

WAN Performance Options     147
Window size can have a large impact on WAN performance. For example, if the TCP window size 
is 8192 bytes, a sending station must stop sending data at this amount if there is no acknowledgment 
received from the destination. This situation is particularly troubling in WAN environments where 
there might be long propagation delays due to distance and subsequent long waits for acknowledg-
ment packets. The greater the link bandwidth, the greater the potential problem.
One simple solution to the problem is a simple enlargement of the window size. Designers must 
approach this solution with caution, however, because sending large amounts of unacknowledged 
data might result in the retransmission of large amounts of data across the WAN. This retransmission 
could have more of an adverse effect on bandwidth than the lost time waiting for acknowledgments. 
Ideal solutions involve network equipment that can adjust window sizes dynamically as WAN line 
conditions dictate. TCP takes acknowledgment failure as a sign of network congestion and throttles 
back the data rate.
Queuing Services
Queuing services give network designers a large degree of control in creating a network that meets 
the demands and requirements of particular applications. Designers do not require queuing services 
within WAN designs, however, if links are never congested. Moreover, if WAN links consistently 
demonstrate congestion, queuing is not the answer; an upgrade is more appropriate. 
The two types of queues are as follows:
I
Hardware queues—Use a simple FIFO strategy. Interfaces require this strategy to successfully 
transmit packets one by one. Designers often refer to the hardware queue as the transmit queue 
or TxQ.
I
Software queue—Offers the ability to schedule packets into the hardware queue. Quality of 
service (QoS) mechanisms can control such scheduling. The CCDA candidate needs to be 
familiar with three such QoS mechanisms: 
— Weighted fair queuing (WFQ)—Addresses a major problem with hardware-based FIFO 
“scheduling” methods and strict priority methods. The problem is that high-volume send-
ers can “crowd out” low-volume senders. WFQ arranges trafﬁc ﬂows into “conversation 
sessions” and alternates between such sessions. WFQ biases the queue service to favor 
smaller trafﬁc ﬂows to ensure that large ﬂows do not monopolize the available bandwidth. 
WFQ is the default conﬁguration on Cisco interfaces operating at or below 2.048 Mbps. 
Faster links default to FIFO.
— Priority Queuing (PQ)—Allows designers to give higher priority to certain types of time-
sensitive or mission-critical protocols. PQ establishes four interface output queues. The 
designer assigns each queue a priority and deﬁnes trafﬁc types for each queue. PQ then 

148     Chapter 6: Designing Wide-Area Networking Solutions
services all trafﬁc in higher-priority queues prior to servicing the lower-priority queues. 
Obviously, this method ensures that certain trafﬁc types receive absolute priority for 
forwarding. It risks “starvation” of lower-priority trafﬁc types.
— Custom Queuing (CQ)—Establishes up to 16 interface output queues. Here, the designer 
assigns type, trafﬁc, and size to each of the custom queues. CQ cycles through each queue 
to send all data, sending the amount from each queue speciﬁed by the designer. This 
approach is a fairer solution in that all trafﬁc types receive some level of service, yet certain 
trafﬁc types are still prioritized. Custom queuing was developed to address problems with 
strict priority queuing.
Trafﬁc Shaping and Policing 
Trafﬁc shaping and trafﬁc policing are similar WAN performance options. Both are commonly 
referred to as committed access rate (CAR). Both inspect trafﬁc and then take action based on trafﬁc 
characteristics. Trafﬁc shaping delays excess packets by holding them in buffers and then releasing 
them at preconﬁgured rates. Trafﬁc policing, on the other hand, typically drops excess trafﬁc or at 
least modiﬁes them in some way (for example, manipulating IP precedence). 
Several methods identify trafﬁc based upon characteristics. For example, policing and shaping can 
use rate thresholds or header bits (Differentiated Services Control Point [DSCP] or IP precedence) 
to determine how to affect trafﬁc.
NOTE
Although the CCDA candidate should be well-versed on the queuing technologies in this 
chapter, there are many other forms of queuing available today, such as low-latency queuing, 
distributed low-latency queuing, and class-based WFQ.

Foundation Summary     149
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of customer requirements, the character-
ization of the existing network, and the design of the new WAN topology as a simple process for 
designing WAN solutions. Common design factors include application access, technology factors, 
and cost factors. WAN ownership options include private ownership, leased ownership, or shared 
ownership. 
Designers should also be aware of WAN performance options available with Cisco equipment. 
These options include compression for bandwidth conservation; TCP window size for increased link 
utilization; and various congestion management and avoidance mechanisms, including queue 
service disciplines, trafﬁc shaping, and policing. Compression options include the following:
I
FRF.9 Frame Relay payload compression  
I
LAPB payload compression using LZS
I
HDLC using LZS 
I
X.25 payload compression of encapsulated trafﬁc 
I

Remember, network designs should carefully use these WAN performance options. Queuing, 
compression, and congestion-management services are all appropriate when network conditions 
dictate their use. Do not consider these performance options at all when bandwidth or usage levels 
do not require such services.

WAN Backup Design Options     159
Foundation Topics
This chapter explores the options for backing up primary WAN connections. This task is critical in 
ensuring that end users of the network enjoy consistent access to remote network resources. This 
chapter also examines sample WAN designs and discusses the strengths and weaknesses regarding 
particular approaches. 
WAN Backup Design Options
CCDAs must often design WAN areas in corporate networks that feature high network availability 
with no single point of failure. In these networks, the failure of a WAN link cannot partition the 
network, isolating one or more sites. Mission-critical data must reach remote destinations regardless 
of media or hardware issues.
Dial Backup Routing 
Chapter 5, “Wide-Area Networking Technologies,” mentioned that dial-up WAN technologies 
continue to see use today not only for small ofﬁce/home ofﬁce (SOHO) WAN connectivity, but also 
for backup purposes. In fact, this role of backup should ensure that dial-up technologies maintain a 
place in new network designs for years to come. 
Using dial backup, a network designer can ensure connectivity between sites (for example) even in 
the event of the failure of the main circuit. This main circuit can be a point-to-point leased line or a 
packet-switched WAN virtual circuit such as Frame Relay. 
Network implementers can conﬁgure routers to monitor the main circuit. If there is a failure, the 
backup line initializes and provides WAN connectivity. Implementers can also control when the 
backup dial-up connection terminates, either immediately upon restoration of the main link or after 
a period of time has elapsed. 
Figure 7-1 details a sample topology that features a dial-up backup to the main Frame Relay WAN 
connectivity link. The text description that follows also refers to this ﬁgure.

160     Chapter 7: Backup Options and Sample WAN Designs
Figure 7-1
Dial Backup Example
Figure 7-1 is a common example of the use of dial backup. Notice the design uses Frame Relay from 
Router A in the Enterprise Edge to Router C at a branch-ofﬁce remote site. The network design relies 
upon Frame Relay in this example due to the amount of bandwidth required and the costs. If the 
Frame Relay connection experiences a disconnect, the WAN design still provides connectivity due 
to an ISDN connection established from Router C to Router B. The following steps provide an 
example of how this dial backup solution operates: 
Step 1
There is a failure of the Frame Relay WAN connection between Routers A 
and C. The routers use neighbor loss detection to learn of the failure. You 
should note that often in failures such as this both interfaces might remain in 
the up state. 
Step 2
Router C features an interface conﬁgured for backup purposes. This device 
is notiﬁed of the circuit failure by the Frame Relay network or detects loss of 
connectivity with the transport network. 
Step 3
The router selects the conﬁgured backup ISDN interface to establish a 
connection with Router B.
Step 4
The routing protocol speciﬁed in the design and conﬁgured throughout the 
management domain or autonomous system recalculates the paths to route 
trafﬁc in the network.
Step 5
When the provider re-establishes the Frame Relay connection, Router C ends 
the ISDN connection.

WAN Backup Design Options     161
Permanent Secondary WAN Link 
Another popular design choice is for the designer to engineer a second and permanent WAN link 
between sites. This design features more than just the advantage of a redundant backup: It also 
provides additional bandwidth. 
The permanent secondary WAN link design meets the redundancy requirement head on. If the 
primary WAN link fails, the network uses the secondary permanent link to transmit data. Often, the 
secondary link is already in use by the network for load sharing. Floating static routes and routing 
protocols ensure that the link is actually a valid path though the network in the event of a failure. 
Another advantage to this redundant design is the increase in bandwidth that can result if the net-
work relies upon the secondary link to carry trafﬁc as well. Load balancing can occur on a per-
destination or per-packet basis. If the secondary link is considerably slower, per-packet load balanc-
ing is appropriate. If the link is as fast, fast switching can occur with per-destination balancing.
This design methodology is not without its disadvantages, however. The cost of this design is often 
prohibitive for organizations. This design might also require more robust networking equipment and 
expertise. For larger networks with many remote ofﬁces that the designer must connect with central 
sites, providing a permanent backup connection for every main link is not ﬁnancially practical. 
Shadow PVC
A WAN backup option that is similar to a permanent secondary WAN link is a shadow PVC. Under 
the shadow PVC design, a service provider provisions the network with a secondary PVC. It is 
possible that a service provider will not charge for this additional circuit as long as the load on it 
remains below a deﬁned level. For example, a plan might specify the shadow PVC at no additional 
charge if load does not exceed one-fourth of the load on the primary PVC—provided, of course, the 
primary link is available. 
Obviously, much expertise is required when conﬁguring a shadow PVC. The implementer must 
ensure the load on the secondary virtual circuit is kept to a minimum. You use either ﬂoating routes 
to load only the primary link or some form of policy routing to ensure that only routing-protocol 
messages and other critical, yet low-volume, trafﬁc routinely uses the shadow circuit.
Internet
Another option for WAN backup is to rely upon the public Internet as a means to transfer data 
between network locations. Obviously, this arrangement is “best effort,” there are no bandwidth 
guarantees, and security is a signiﬁcant concern.

162     Chapter 7: Backup Options and Sample WAN Designs
Although there are many options for implementing the Internet as a backup option, the CCDA 
candidate should be aware of three:
I
IP routing without constraints
I
GRE tunnels
I
IPSec tunnels 
Some organizations, especially larger ones, work with their service providers to advertise their 
networks in the Internet. This arrangement enables them to route trafﬁc freely via the Internet. 
Without payload encryption at the enterprise sites, this method has signiﬁcant security issues.
Both GRE and IPSec methodologies rely upon tunneling to transmit data over the public Internet. 
Network-layer tunneling involves one Layer 3 protocol transporting another Layer 3 protocol over 
the network—usually in a secure fashion. 
GRE, a network-layer encapsulation deﬁned by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 
2784, tunnels protocols over IP networks, including the Internet. Speciﬁcally, Cisco routers can use 
GRE to tunnel IP over other IP networks. This setup suits small- to medium-sized Internet backup 
solutions that do not require the greatest degree of security—or that use protocols incompatible with 
IPSec.
Figure 7-2 demonstrates a backup GRE tunnel over the Internet. In this example, the primary link 
is Frame Relay, and a backup GRE tunnel using the Internet ensures connectivity between the 
central ofﬁce and the remote site. The Cisco equipment creates the tunnel from a source router 
(ingress) to the destination router (egress), and the tunnel appears as an actual interface on each 
router.

WAN Backup Design Options     163
The steps that follow detail the functioning of GRE:
Step 1
The Cisco network designates packets for transmission across the backup 
GRE tunnel. 
Step 2
These packets already contain additional information by way of 
encapsulation from the transmitting protocol (IP). The ingress router further 
encapsulates the packets with a new GRE header. 
Step 3
The Cisco router places the packets into a tunnel. These packets now feature 
a destination address of the egress router. 
Step 4
The packets arrive at the egress, and this router strips away the GRE 
encapsulation information. 
Step 5
Network equipment forwards the packets, which now contain the original IP 
headers and destination address information.
IPSec also provides for tunneling IP over IP networks, yet as its name implies, this technology 
inherently provides security for these transfers. IPSec functions at the network layer and 
encapsulates and authenticates IP packets between IPSec routers. 
The following list details the features and beneﬁts of IPSec as a network solution:
I
IPSec features data conﬁdentiality. Cisco routers encrypt packets prior to their transmission 
across the network. This feature is obviously a huge beneﬁt given the Internet as a transmission 
medium.
I
IPSec features data integrity. IPSec receivers can authenticate packets sent from an IPSec 
sender. This check ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission. 
I
IPSec also features data origin authentication. IPSec receivers can authenticate the source of 
IPSec packets. This check ensures the sending station is legitimately the sending station. 
I
IPSec includes antireplay attacks. Cisco routers can detect and reject replay attempts. 
I
IPSec features simple deployment for network implementers. Typically, the intermediate 
systems, such as the backbone Internet service provider (ISP) systems, do not require changes. 
I
IPSec is completely transparent to the applications running in the network. They are not and do 
not need to be aware of the tunneling technology to function. 
I
IPSec utilizes Internet Key Exchange (IKE) for the automation of security key management. 
I
IPSec interoperates with the public-key infrastructure (PKI).
I
IPSec is compatible with GRE if necessary.

164     Chapter 7: Backup Options and Sample WAN Designs
Sample WAN Designs 
The remainder of this chapter focuses on sample WAN designs and the technologies used in the 
implementation of these designs. It also includes new information that these design examples 
highlight. Because the CCDA examination has candidates examine existing and proposed network 
designs, this section is extremely important and should not be overlooked.  
WAN Technologies for Remote Access
Figure 7-3 shows a network topology in relation to the Enterprise Composite Network Model. This 
network needs WAN remote-access solutions to accommodate remote users of the network and 
small ofﬁces that do not require constant access.
Figure 7-3
Remote Access Example
The network designer in this example has gained the following information:
I
The branch-ofﬁce users should be able to access the central site network seamlessly—as if the 
users are in that actual network.
I
The remote users need to access the network sporadically to check for e-mail notiﬁcations and 
transfer reports that are typically under 200 KB in size.
I
The branch-ofﬁce locations require more consistent ﬁle transfer access and interactive trafﬁc 
transfers. Low to medium volume is expected. 
I
Two of the branch ofﬁces often need to share data directly with each other. This data is mission-
critical compared to other trafﬁc sent by the branch ofﬁces. 
I
The client has indicated no performance speciﬁcs for the network.

Sample WAN Designs     165
Given these requirements, a designer might choose permanent connections between the remote 
ofﬁces and the central site using Frame Relay PVCs. Nonpermanent dial-up connections are 
appropriate for the remote access users. 
Packet-Switched Network Designs
Although the design mentioned here certainly meets the requirements put forth by the client, it must 
still address an important design issue. Speciﬁcally, the designer must decide upon the speciﬁc 
Frame Relay topology. Packet-switched networks have three basic designs. (Although Frame Relay 
is the focus here, note that these designs are also appropriate for other WAN technologies.) These 
designs are 
I
Star topology
I
Partial-mesh topology
I
Full-mesh topology
Star Topology
A star topology speciﬁes a core router that serves as the hub for the WAN connections. Designers 
often refer to this topology as a hub-and-spoke topology. The core router connects to each of the 
branch ofﬁces; in fact, branch ofﬁces can only communicate with each other if they pass their 
communications through the core (hub) router. The star topology features the advantage of 
simpliﬁed and centralized management of the WAN topology.
Unfortunately, this design topology is not without its problems and disadvantages. These include the 
following:
I
The central hub router represents a single point of failure in the design. If this router fails, WAN 
communications across all the branch ofﬁces are affected. 
I
Overall performance of the WAN relies upon a single point. This single point is the hub router; 
all trafﬁc must pass through this potential bottleneck in the design.
Partial-Mesh Topology
The partial-mesh topology approach features virtual circuits that connect many but not all the 
routers in the topology. This design reduces the number of routers in the topology that require direct 
connections to each other. It accommodates those sites that do require connectivity directly to each 
other due to performance or reliability concerns. A partial-mesh design might have several “core” 
or hub routers that act as collection points for nonmeshed routers to reach each other. Obviously, 
there are many forms of partially meshed topologies. 

166     Chapter 7: Backup Options and Sample WAN Designs
The advantages to the partial mesh topology include
I
Improved performance 
I
Improved redundancy
I
Fewer virtual circuits than full-mesh designs 
The disadvantages of a partial mesh topology include
I
Potentially a greater number of virtual circuits than a star topology 
I
A greater level of expertise 
Full-Mesh Topology
In a full-mesh design, each node (router) connects to every other node in the network design. This 
design features the greatest level of redundancy and performance. Obviously, this approach is nearly 
impossible in very large networks due to cost concerns. 
The advantages of a full-mesh topology include
I
Best possible redundancy
I
Best possible performance when conﬁgured properly
Disadvantages include
I
Large costs due to the number of virtual circuits required. There is one for every connection 
between routers.
I
They typically require large numbers of packet and broadcast replications for transmission to 
all locations in the network.
I
Conﬁguring routers in full-mesh environment is quite complex—especially in environments 
with no multicast support. 
Figure 7-4 shows an overview of the WAN design in this example. Notice the use of a partial mesh 
and both permanent and dial-up options. 

Sample WAN Designs     167
Figure 7-4
Remote Access Design Example
A WAN Connecting Enterprise Sites
Often, the central site might consist of two facilities that are geographically disparate. The designer 
must connect these two sites using WAN technology to make them appear as one seamless network. 
Users must be able to access the resources of each site as if they were one site. The sites transmit a 
high volume of trafﬁc, and each site expects to transfer voice and video trafﬁc to the other site.
Due to the requirements, a designer might recommend the provision of a high-speed point-to-point 
connection using Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy 
(SDH). Thanks to the SONET/SDH technology, this organization can enjoy high-speed point-to-
point connections of speeds at 155 Mbps or much greater, up to 10 Gbps. The costs of this technol-
ogy depend almost entirely on the bandwidth required and the distance between the two sites.

 Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
Remember, the CCDA exam requires that candidates analyze existing or proposed designs and 
answer detailed questions. This chapter helps prepare candidates for this experience by proposing 
sample designs and discussing key technologies.
One of the most important areas covered here is the various backup designs that exist for WANs. 
More networks feature mission-critical data that must be able to reach distant areas of the network. 
Designing backup WAN solutions helps ensure that the data is successful in reaching their 
destination.
The CCDA candidate should also be intimately familiar with the design options of a star, partial-
mesh, and full-mesh topology. Although Frame Relay networks use them, these topologies are 
relevant for other WAN technologies as well.

VPN and DSL WAN Design
This chapter reviews virtual private network (VPN) and digital subscriber line (DSL) technolo-
gies for WANs. DSL provides broadband Internet access to business and residential customers 
at speeds far greater than dial-up with costs less than a leased T1. Enterprise companies are 
increasingly using DSL coupled with VPN technology to replace their WAN links.
VPNs create private tunnels across the Internet. It uses site-to-site tunnels between ofﬁces. The 
IP Security (IPSec) protocol creates secure tunnels over the Internet.

Foundation Topics
The “Foundation Topics” cover DSL technologies and VPNs. The section “DSL Technologies” 
covers each of the several DSL technologies and their design characteristics. ADSL is the most 
popular technology for residential customers. ADSL provides fast download speeds with a slower 
upload speed. SDSL is the most popular DSL technology for enterprises. SDSL provides the same 
upload and download speeds.
The section “VPNs” covers the VPN technologies and their design characteristics. GRE is a Cisco 
tunneling protocol that encapsulates packets into IP headers, creating a virtual point-to-point link 
between two Cisco routers. Internet tunnels use the IPSec protocol to create secure tunnels over the 
Internet. IPSec is an internal standard that deﬁnes a set of protocols, key management, and algo-
rithms for authentication and encryption. 
DSL Technologies
This section reviews the DSL technologies that you can use for access and WANs. When used with 
VPN technologies, DSL can provide WAN connectivity for remote ofﬁces at a lower cost than 
dedicated services.
DSL increases connectivity options for ﬁxed remote access and extranet ofﬁces and users. DSL 
technology uses existing twisted-pair telephone lines to transport high-bandwidth data, such as mul-
timedia and video, to service subscribers. DSL provides high bandwidth on the existing telephone 
company infrastructure with dedicated, point-to-point, public network access. With DSL, the user 
is always connected to the service provider’s network. A DSL connection is “always on,” providing 
the speciﬁed bandwidth to the user or ofﬁce. Charges for DSL are typically a ﬁxed monthly fee. In 
some major markets, private DSL access is available. In this case, permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) 
extend the enterprise network to the DSL access device.
In North America, DSL is favorably priced based on cost for equivalent bandwidth when compared 
to dial-up access to a service-provider network by modem or ISDN. It also provides price advan-
tages over leased lines, including full or fractional T1/E1, and packet network services such as 
Frame Relay. The disadvantages of DSL include spotty availability due to distance and infrastruc-
ture quality, lack of guaranteed transport bandwidth through the intermediate public networks, and 
security issues within the Internet. Where available, cable modems offer comparable service for 
remote access at a similar cost.

DSL Technologies     177
DSL Types
As DSL technology matured, service providers made available different implementations. DSL is 
an Open System Interconnection (OSI) model physical layer technology. The marketplace has many 
variations. The two leading schemes are SDSL and ADSL. The forms of DSL include the following:
I
ADSL
I
SDSL
I
IDSL
I
High-bit-rate DSL (HDSL)
I
VDSL
For Internet DSL providers, the architecture looks like Figure 8-1. DSL modems with Ethernet 
interfaces at the home ofﬁce or business location connect to the local-loop connection to the central 
ofﬁce. DSL access multiplexers (DSLAMs) aggregate the connections. DSL terminators terminate 
the virtual circuits and pass the trafﬁc on to the IP networks.
Figure 8-1
Basic DSL Architecture
ADSL
ADSL is a DSL technology targeted for residential customers. It is deﬁned by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1.413 standard. It provides asymmetric speed with a downlink 
speed (from the central ofﬁce to the customer) faster than the uplink speed. Downstream rates range 
from 256 kbps to 8 Mbps. Upstream rates range from 16 kbps to 800 kbps. ADSL transmissions 
work at distances up to 18,000 ft (5488 m) over a single copper twisted pair.
ADSL G.lite is a variant speciﬁcation that reduces the device requirements of ADSL. It eliminates 
the requirement for special wiring installation services. ADSL G.lite provides rates up to 1.5 Mbps.

Another variant is Rate Adaptive ADSL (RADSL), which allows the DSL modem to adapt its speed 
based on the quality and length of the line.
Some examples of services are

786 kbps download/ 256 kbps uplink
I
1.5 Mbps download/128 kbps uplink
I
1.5 Mbps download/384 kbps uplink
I
6 Mbps download/384 Kbps uplink
HDSL
HDSL provides 1.544 Mbps of bandwidth but uses two twisted-pair lines (4 wires). The bandwidth 
rate is symmetrical. The HDSL range is limited to 12,000 ft (3658.5 m). Signal repeaters extend the 
service beyond the distance. Because it requires two pairs, HDSL is used primarily for digital-loop 
carrier systems, interexchange points of presence (POPs), and private data networks. A variant, 
HDSL-2 is a two-wire version that provides the same speeds or double the speed with four wires.
SDSL
SDSL provides equal bandwidth for both the uplink and downlink lines. SDSL is targeted to busi-
ness customers to replace their more expensive T1 circuits. SDSL uses a single twisted-pair line and 
has an operating range limited to 22,000 ft. Because of its symmetric capabilities, SDSL is often 
marketed as business DSL. SDSL provides speeds up to 2.3 Mbps.
Some service examples are

384 kbps symmetric
I
768 kbps symmetric

I

DSL Technologies     179
IDSL
IDSL was developed to provide DSL service to locations using existing ISDN facilities by redirect-
ing ISDN trafﬁc to a DSLAM. It maintains all the electrical capabilities of ISDN, allowing for 
longer local-loop runs that ISDN can support. The customer premises equipment (CPE) is still 
any ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) bridge/router. The beneﬁt of IDSL is the cost of the service 
over ISDN. IDSL provides a rate of 144 kbps but uses the D channel in addition to the two B chan-
nels. The beneﬁt of IDSL is that it provides a ﬂat rate for the ISDN type service versus the per-call 
rate of ISDN.
The advantage of IDSL over ISDN is that it can provide the same data capabilities over longer local-
loop facilities. Customers can save because IDSL is cheaper than ISDN. For example, a small 
business with an ISDN service of $0.02 per minute for ISDN B-channel usage might pay as much 
as $1300 a month. It can pay IDSL service on a ﬂat-rate basis, totaling approximately $150 per 
month with no per-minute usage charge.
VDSL
VDSL provides asymmetric DSL services at speeds much greater than ADSL. VDSL still uses a 
single pair to provide up to 52 Mbps downlink speeds and up to 16 Mbps uplink speeds. Only 
selected areas offer VDSL, and it is limited to 4000 ft from the central ofﬁce. 
Cisco provides Long-Reach Ethernet (LRE) over VDSL that provides Ethernet services over exist-
ing Category 1/2/3 twisted-pair wiring at speeds from 5 to 15 Mbps (full duplex) and distances up 
to 5000 ft.

180     Chapter 8: VPN and DSL WAN Design
Because of the high bandwidth capabilities of DSL technology and its reduced cost, it has become 
a preferred access technology for enterprises to connect remote ofﬁces. Even with DSL’s spotty 
presence, it is being used with VPN technologies to connect remote ofﬁces to corporate locations. 
Such setups require VPNs to secure the trafﬁc streams as they traverse the public, untrusted Internet.
VPNs
This section reviews the technologies for VPNs and the design of WANs using VPNs as primary or 
backup transport.
Enterprise customers should consider the Internet, with the use of VPN technology, as a means to 
connect corporate locations when bandwidth guarantees are not required to support critical trafﬁc and 
as an affordable backup for dedicated circuits. VPNs create private tunnels across the Internet. You 
can create these tunnels from a single host to a VPN concentrator, or you can create site-to-site tun-
nels between ofﬁces. Figure 8-2 shows VPN tunnels between remote sites and the corporate ofﬁce.

VPN Tunnels

VPNs     181
You can use several different technologies to create VPN tunnels:
I
GRE
I
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
I
Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE)
I
VPDN
I
IPSec
I
MPLS
GRE
GRE is a Cisco tunneling protocol that encapsulates entire packets into new IP headers, creating a 
virtual point-to-point link between two Cisco routers. The new header has the source and destination 
addresses of the tunnel end points. The virtual link crosses an IP network. GRE is described in RFC 
1701; it was created to tunnel IP and other packet types. Encapsulated packets types can be IP 
packets or non-IP packets, such as Novell IPX or AppleTalk packets.
PPTP
PPTP is described in RFC 2637. It is a network protocol developed by a vendor consortium 
including Microsoft for transferring data from client PCs to enterprise servers using tunneled PPP 
through an IP network. PPTP client software is deployed in Windows 95, ME, NT, 2000, and XP. 
Cisco added support for PPTP to Cisco IOS routers, PIX Firewalls, and VPN concentrators.
MPPE
MPPE is a Microsoft protocol that converts PPP packets into an encrypted form. It is used for 
creating VPNs over dial-up networks. Most Cisco access platforms support MPPE, which is part 
of Microsoft’s PPTP client VPN solution.
VPDN
VPDN is a Cisco protocol that allows a private dial-in service to span across several remote-access 
servers (RAS). A VPDN is a network that extends remote access to a private network using a shared 
infrastructure. VPDNs use Layer 2 tunnel technologies (Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol (L2F), Layer 2 
Tunnel Protocol (L2TP), and PPTP) to extend the Layer 2 and higher parts of the network connection 
from a remote user across an Internet service provider (ISP) network to a private network. VPDNs 
are a cost-effective method of establishing a long-distance, point-to-point connection between 
remote-dial users and a private network. 

182     Chapter 8: VPN and DSL WAN Design
Instead of making connections directly to the network by using Public Switched Telephone Network 
(PSTN) toll services, access VPDN users need to use only the PSTN to connect to the ISP RAS 
acting as a local POP. The ISP then forwards the user’s PPP session to a tunnel server at the customer 
network. Forwarding calls through the network as opposed to making a long-distance PSTN call 
provides dramatic cost savings.
With VPDN, a client dials into a network access server, which forwards the PPP session to a L2F 
home gateway (HGW) for authentication, as shown in Figure 8-3. The HGW is not collocated with 
the dialed RAS.
Figure 8-3
VPDN Tunnel
IPSec
IPSec provides a set of security services at the IP layer. The security architecture for IP is deﬁned 
in RFC 2401. It is an architecture that IPv4 and IPv6 can use. IPSec is a set of protocols, key 
management, and algorithms for authentication and encryption. Two central protocols for IPSec are
I
IP AH
I
ESP
IP AH provides data-connection integrity and data-origin authentication for connectionless IP 
communications. You can use AH alone or with ESP. AH is described in RFC 2402. ESP provides 
data conﬁdentiality, data-origin authentication, and limited trafﬁc-ﬂow conﬁdentiality. Data 
conﬁdentiality is just another way to say data encryption. ESP is described in RFC 2406.
IPSec uses the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol for the automatic exchange of keys to form 
security associations (SA) between two systems. IKE is not used if the SAs are conﬁgured manually. 
IKE eliminates the need to manually specify all of the IPSec SA parameters of both peers and allows 
encryption keys to change during IPSec sessions. IKE is described in RFC 2409.

Network
VPDN Tunnel

VPNs     183
Finally, the ESP protocol uses encryption algorithms such as DES and 3DES for bulk encryption 
and for data conﬁdentiality during IKE key exchange. 
IPSec Connection Steps
IPSec operation follows ﬁve steps:
I
Step 1: Process initiation
I
Step 2: IKE Phase 1
I
Step 3: IKE Phase 2
I
Step 4: Data transfer
I
Step 5: Tunnel termination
Process initiation is simply the speciﬁcation of the type of trafﬁc to be encrypted. You accomplish 
this step by conﬁguring access lists. IKE Phase 1 authenticates the IPSec peers and sets up a secure 
channel between the peers to enable IKE exchanges.
After the IKE SA is established, the IKE process negotiates the IPSec SA in IKE Phase 2. When 
Step 3 is completed, data transfer occurs. The payload of data packets is encrypted using ESP. The 
tunnel is terminated if the IPSec SA are deleted or their lifetimes expire.
AH
AH provides connectionless integrity (data integrity) for packet headers and data payload and 
authentication but does not provide conﬁdentiality. Authentication comes from applying a one-way 
hash function to the packet to create a message digest. As shown in Figure 8-4, the shared keyed 
hash is applied to both the IP header and packet. The hash creates an authentication header. The 
receiving IPSec peer applies the same key hash and extracts the transmitted hash from the AH 
header. If the hashes match, the authentication passes.

184     Chapter 8: VPN and DSL WAN Design
One note with AH is that not all the IP header ﬁelds are used to hash the IP header. The ﬁelds that 
change are not part of the hash process. One of these ﬁelds is the Time-To-Live (TTL) ﬁeld, which 
changes at each router hop.
ESP
ESP provides conﬁdentiality, data-origin authentication, connectionless integrity, an antireplay 
service (a form of partial sequence integrity), and limited trafﬁc-ﬂow conﬁdentiality as negotiated 
by the end points when they establish an SA. ESP packet authentication is provided by an optional 
ﬁeld. Authentication is performed after encryption is performed. ESP performs encryption by using 
56-bit DES and 3DES. 
ESP Tunnel or Transport Mode
ESP provides protection of the IP header ﬁelds only in tunnel mode. In tunnel mode, the original IP 
header and payload are encrypted. As shown in Figure 8-5, ESP prepends a new IP header and IPSec 
header to the encrypted IP header and data. This method provides protection at the IP layer.
Figure 8-5
ESP Tunnel Mode
In transport mode, only the IP data is encrypted. As shown in Figure 8-6, ESP inserts an IPSec 
header between the original IP header and the encrypted data. Only the upper layers are protected 
in transport mode; it does not protect the IP layer.

DES and 3DES
DES is an older U.S. Government-approved standard widely used for encryption. DES uses a 56-bit 
key to scramble and unscramble messages. Exported DES uses a 40-bit bit version. DES breaks data 
into 64-bit blocks and then processes it with a 56-bit shared secret key.
The latest DES standard uses a 3-by-56 bit key (a 168-bit key called Triple DES), where the input 
is encrypted three times. 3DES operates like DES in that data is broken into 64-bit blocks. 3DES 
then processes each block three times, each time with an independent key.
The two IPSec peers must ﬁrst exchange their shared secret key, which can encrypt and decrypt the 
message or generate and verify a message authentication code. After the two IPSec peers obtain 
their shared keys, they can use DES or 3DES for data encryption.
HMACs
Both AH and ESP use HMACs to ensure data integrity and authentication. HMACs use hash func-
tions and private keys to perform message authentication. IPSec speciﬁes the use of HMAC-MD5 
and HMAC-SHA-1 for IKE and IPSec.
MD5 is a hash algorithm used to authenticate packet data. MD5 uses a 128-bit key to perform a hash 
function to produce a 128-bit authentication value of the input data. The message digest serves as a 
signature of the data. The signature is inserted into the AH or ESP headers. The receiving IPSec peer 
computes the authentication value of the received packet and compares it to the value stored in the 
received packet.
SHA-1 is also a hash algorithm used to authenticate packet data. SHA-1 uses a 160-bit secret key to 
produce a 160-bit authentication value of the input data. As with MD5, the signature is inserted into 
the AH or ESP headers. The receiving IPSec peer computes the authentication value of the received 
packet and compares it to the value stored in the received packet.
Difﬁe-Hellman
Difﬁe-Hellman is a key-agreement algorithm used by two end devices to agree on a shared secret 
key. IKE uses Difﬁe-Hellman for key exchange during IKE Phase 1. These secret keys are then used 
by encryption algorithms.
Each Difﬁe-Hellman peer generates a public and private key pair. The public key is calculated from 
the private key. The private key is kept secret; the public keys are exchanged between the peers. Each 
peer then computes the same shared secret number by combining the other’s public key and its own 
private key. The shared secret number is converted into a shared secret key. The shared secret key is 
never exchanged.

186     Chapter 8: VPN and DSL WAN Design
WAN Design Using IPSec Tunnels
Enterprise WANs are usually constructed using packet-switched services (Frame Relay, ATM, or 
MPLS) and private lines encapsulated using PPP and high-level data link control (HDLC). These 
circuits come at a cost of monthly recurring charges for access and PVCs. Enterprises can reduce 
their WAN costs by replacing these circuits with site-to-site VPN tunnels over the Internet. Point-
to-point IPSec tunnels replace the permanent circuits. Access to the Internet can come from dial-up, 
cable-modem, or DSL technologies.
Figure 8-7 shows a private WAN that uses Frame Relay circuits. The WAN can use EIGRP as a 
routing protocol. The service provider makes service guarantees.
Figure 8-7
Frame Relay WAN
You can replace the Frame Relay WAN with VPN tunnels over the Internet. Figure 8-8 shows the 
network using VPN. The enterprise might choose to retain a Frame Relay PVC between the core 
sites with a VPN backup. All the remote sites use redundant tunnels to the core sites. To reduce costs, 
you can use business SDSL for access to the Internet. EIGRP is still used as a routing protocol 
between the enterprise routers. The disadvantage of using VPNs for the WAN is that the service 
guarantees are limited or nonexistent. Trafﬁc depends on the availability of the Internet. You might 
get service guarantees if a single service provider can provide service to all the sites in the WAN and 
if it supports IP quality of service (QoS) in its transport network.
MPLS
MPLS is a transport service that can provide VPNs. An advantage of using MPLS for VPN service 
is the ability to offer service guarantees. Guarantees are not currently possible when using the 
Internet to transport VPNs.

WAN Using VPN Tunnels
MPLS speciﬁes ways that you can map Layer 3 trafﬁc to connection-oriented Layer 2 transport 
protocols such as ATM; it adds a label containing speciﬁc routing information to each IP packet 
directing trafﬁc through explicitly deﬁned paths. It allows managers to implement policies to assign 
labels to various classes of trafﬁc. This arrangement enables the service providers to offer different 
classes of services (CoSs) to different trafﬁc types or from different customers. The policies could 
send trafﬁc over a path that is not necessarily the path with the lowest routing metric. With MPLS, 
service providers can provide VPN services provisioned to give the appropriate priority to premium 
customers.
MPLS Label
In packet environment, the MPLS label is inserted between the Layer 2 header and the Layer 3 
header of a Layer 2 frame. This setup applies for Packet over SONET (POS), Ethernet, Frame Relay, 
and labels over ATM. In ATM networks with label switching, the label is mapped into the virtual 
path identiﬁer/virtual channel identiﬁer (VPI/VCI) ﬁelds of the ATM header. The MPLS label ﬁeld 
is 32 bits in length, with the actual label (tag) being 20 bits.
MPLS adds labels to the packets at the edge of the network and removes them at the other end. The 
labels are assigned packets based on a grouping. Each group is assigned a service class. The core of 
the network reads the labels and provides the appropriate services.
MPLS Label Switch Routers
All routers within a MPLS network are Label Switch Routers (LSRs), which forward based on the 
label and not on routing protocols. If the MPLS network uses ATM, the LSRs are called ATM LSRs. 
The Edge LSR is responsible for adding the label to the packet. The label is removed before the 
packet is sent from the MPLS network. Figure 8-9 shows a diagram of these routers.

P router—The service provider’s internal core routers. These routers do not have to maintain 
VPN routes.
I
C router—The customer’s internal routers. They do not connect to the provider. These routers 
do not maintain VPN routes.
I
CE router—The edge routers on the customer side that connect to the service provider. These 
routers do not maintain VPN routes.
I
PE router—The edge routers on the service-provider side that connect with the customer’s CE 
routers. PE routers maintain VPN routes for the VPNs associated with the connected interfaces.
Figure 8-10 shows a diagram of these routers in a MPLS VPN network.
WAN Design Using MPLS VPNs
One characteristic of MPLS VPNs is that each site in the VPN service is a peer. Because of the 
peering of all sites, a logical mesh topology is acquired.
Figure 8-11 shows a WAN topology using MPLS VPNs. Each router in the diagram is peered to the 
others. The service provider contracts CoSs for the enterprise. The provider beneﬁts because it can 
isolate customers into security groups, provide CoSs, and scale VPN networks.

Internet Protocol Version 4
This chapter reviews Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) address structures and IPv4 address 
types. IPv4 is the version of the protocol that the Internet has used since the initial allocation of 
IPv4 addresses in 1981. The size of the enterprise indicated the address class that was allocated. 
This chapter covers the IPv4 header to give you an understanding of IPv4 characteristics. The 
mid 1990s saw the implementation of classless interdomain routing (CIDR), network address 
translation (NAT), and private address space to prevent the apparent exhaustion of IPv4 address 
space. Companies implement variable-length subnet masks (VLSMs) in their networks to pro-
vide intelligent address assignment and summarization. The CCDA needs to understand all  
these concepts to design IPv4 addressing for a network.

IPv4 Header     203
Foundation Topics
This chapter reviews IPv4 headers, address classes, and assignment methods.
IP is the network-layer protocol in TCP/IP. IP contains logical addressing and information for 
routing packets throughout the internetwork. IP is described in RFC 791, which was prepared for 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in September 1981.
IP provides for the transmission of blocks of data, called datagrams or packets, from a source to 
a destination. The sources and destinations are identiﬁed by 32-bit IP addresses. The source and 
destination devices are workstations, servers, printers, and routers. The CCDA candidate must 
understand IPv4 logical address classes and assignment. The IPv4 protocol also provides for the 
fragmentation and reassembly of large packets for transport over networks with small maximum 
transmission units (MTUs). The CCDA candidate must have a good understanding of this packet 
fragmentation and reassembly.
IPv4 Header
The best way to understand IPv4 is to know the IPv4 header and all its ﬁelds. Segments from TCP 
or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are passed on to IP for processing. The IP header is appended 
to the TCP or UDP segment. The TCP or UDP segment then becomes the IP data. The IPv4 header 
is 20 bytes in length when it uses no optional ﬁelds. The IP header includes the addresses of the 
sending host and destination host. It also includes the upper-layer protocol, a ﬁeld for prioritization, 
and a ﬁeld for fragmentation. Figure 9-1 shows the IP header format.

The following is a description of each ﬁeld in the IP header:
I
Version—This ﬁeld is 4 bits long. It indicates the format, based on the version number, of the 
IP header. Version 4 is the current version; therefore, this ﬁeld is set to 0100 for IPv4 packets. 
This ﬁeld is set to 0110 in IPv6 networks.
I
IHL—Internet header length. This ﬁeld in 4 bits long. It indicates the length of the header in 
32-bit words (4 bytes) so that the beginning of the data can be found. The minimum value for 
a valid header (ﬁve 32-bit words) is 5 (0101).
I
ToS—Type of service. This ﬁeld is 8 bits in length. The Type of Service ﬁeld includes 3 bits for 
IP precedence.   
I
Total length—This ﬁeld is 16 bits in length. It represents the length of the datagram or 
packet in bytes, including the header and data. The maximum length of an IP packet can be 
216 – 1 = 65,535 bytes. Routers use this ﬁeld to determine whether fragmentation is necessary 
by comparing the total length with the outgoing MTU.
I
Identiﬁcation—This ﬁeld is 16 bits in length. It identiﬁes fragments for reassembly.
I
Flags—This ﬁeld is 3 bits in length. It indicates whether the packet can be fragmented and 
whether more fragments follow. Bit 0 is reserved and set to 0. Bit 1 indicates May Fragment (0) 
or Do Not Fragment (1). Bit 2 indicates Last Fragment (0) or More Fragments (1) to follow.
I
Fragment offset—This ﬁeld is 13 bits in length. It indicates (in bytes) where in the packet this 
fragment belongs. The fragment has an offset of zero.
I
Time to live—This ﬁeld is 8 bits in length. This ﬁeld indicates the maximum time the packet 
is to remain on the network. Each router decrements this ﬁeld by 1 for loop avoidance. If this 
ﬁeld is 0, the packet must be discarded. This scheme permits routers to discard undeliverable 
packets.
I
Protocol—This ﬁeld is 8 bits in length. It indicates the upper-layer protocol. The Internet 
Assigned Number Authority (IANA) is responsible for assigning IP protocol values. Table 9-2 
shows some key protocol numbers.

I
Header checksum—This ﬁeld is 16 bits in length.  The checksum does not include the data 
portion of the packet. It is recomputed and veriﬁed at each point the IP header is processed.
I
Source address—This ﬁeld is 32 bits in length. It is the IP address of the sender.
I
Destination address—This ﬁeld is 32 bits in length. It is the IP address of the receiver.
I
IP options—This ﬁeld is variable in length. The options provide for control functions that are 
useful in some situations but unnecessary for the most common communications. Speciﬁc 
options are security, loose source routing, strict source routing, record route, and timestamp.
I
Padding—This ﬁeld is variable in length. It ensures the IP header ends on a 32-bit boundary.

The ﬁrst three (leftmost) bits are the IP precedence bits. These bits deﬁne values that are used by 
QoS methods. The precedence bits especially help in marking packets to give them differentiated

All default trafﬁc is set with 000 in the precedence bits. Voice trafﬁc is usually set to 101 (critical) 
to give it priority over normal trafﬁc.
The D bit is the delay bit. It indicates normal (0) or low (1) delay. The T bit is the throughput bit. 
The T bit indicates normal (0) or high (1) throughput. The R bit can indicate normal (0) or high (1) 
reliability. RFC 791 reserved Bits 6 and 7 for future use. 
RFC 1349 redeﬁned Bits 3 and 6 to reﬂect a desired type of service optimization. But RFC 1349 is 
superceded by RFC 2474, which redeﬁnes the ToS ﬁeld.
RFC 2474 redeﬁnes the ToS octet as the Differentiated Services (DS) ﬁeld and further speciﬁes Bits 
0 through 5 as the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to support differentiated services.  
The DS ﬁeld takes the format shown in Figure 9-3. The CU ﬁeld, currently unused, is reserved for 
future use.
Figure 9-3
DS Field
The DS ﬁeld provides more granular levels of packet classiﬁcation by using 6 bits for packet 
marking. There are 26= 64 levels of classiﬁcation with DS, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the 
8 levels of the IP precedence bits.
IPv4 Fragmentation
One of the key characteristics of IPv4 is fragmentation and reassembly. Although the maximum 
length of an IP packet is 65,536 bytes, many lower-layer protocols do not support such large MTUs. 
For example, the MTU for Ethernet is approximately 1518 bytes. When the IP layer receives a 
packet to send, it ﬁrst queries the outgoing interface to get its MTU. If the size of the packet is 
greater than the MTU of the interface, it fragments the packet.
When a packet is fragmented, it is not reassembled until it reaches the destination IP layer. The 
destination IP layer performs the reassembly. Any router in the path can fragment a packet, and any 
router in the path can fragment a fragmented packet again. Each fragmented packet receives its own 
IP header and is routed independently from other packets. Routers and switches in the path do not 
perform the reassembly of the fragments. The destination host performs the reassembly and places 
the fragments in the correct order by looking at the identiﬁcation and fragment offset ﬁelds.

If one or more fragments are lost, the entire packet must be retransmitted. Retransmission is the 
responsibility of the higher-layer protocol (such as TCP). Also, you can set the Flags ﬁeld in the 
IP header to Do Not Fragment the packet. If the ﬁeld indicates Do Not Fragment, the packet is 
discarded if the outgoing MTU is smaller than the packet.
IPv4 Addressing
This section covers the IP address classes, private addressing, and NAT. The IP address space was 
initially divided into ﬁve classes identiﬁed by the initial bits of the address. Class A, B, and C are 
unicast IP addresses. IP Class D addresses are multicast, and IP Class E addresses are reserved. 
Private addresses are selected address ranges that are reserved for use by companies in their private 
networks. These private addresses are not routed in the Internet. NAT translates between private and 
public addresses. IP addresses assign an unique logical number to a network device or interface. The 
number is 32 bits in length. To make the number easier to read, use the dotted-decimal format. The 
bits are combined into four 8-bit groups, each converted into decimal numbers. Appendix B, “The 
OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion,” contains a review of binary and hexadecimal 
number manipulation.
The following example shows an IP address in binary and decimal formats:
Binary IP address: 01101110 00110010 11110010 00001010

The IP address is 110.50.242.10.
IPv4 Address Classes
IPv4 addresses have ﬁve classes—A, B, C, D, and E. In classful addressing, the most signiﬁcant bits 
of the ﬁrst byte determine the address class of the IP address. Table 9-5 shows the high-order bits of 
each IP address class.
The IP Classes A, B, and C are unicast addresses. Unicast addresses represent a single destination. 
Class D is for multicast addresses. Multicast addresses are a group of hosts. Class E addresses are 
reserved for experimental use. IANA allocates the IPv4 address space. IANA delegates regional 
assignments to Regional Internet Registries (RIR).  The four RIRs are
I
ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers)
I
RIPE NCC (Reseaux IP Europeens Network Control Center)
I
APNIC (Asia Paciﬁc Network Information Center)
I
LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Center)
The following sections discuss each of these classes in detail.

Class A Addresses
Class A addresses range from 0 (00000000) to 127 (01111111) in the ﬁrst byte. Network numbers 
available for assignment to organizations are from 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0, with networks 0 and 127 
reserved. For example, 127.0.0.1 is reserved for localhost. A packet sent to a localhost address is 
sent to the local machine. Furthermore, network 10.0.0.0 is reserved for private addresses.
By default, for Class A addresses, the ﬁrst byte is the network number and the three remaining bytes 
are the host number. The format is N.H.H.H with N being the network part and H the host part. With 
24 bits available, there are 224 – 2 = 16,777,214 IP addresses for host assignment per Class A net-
work. Subtract two for the network number (all 0s) and broadcast address (all 1s). A network with 
this many hosts will surely not work with so many hosts attempting to broadcast on the network. 
This section discusses subnetting later as a method for deﬁning smaller networks within a larger 
network address.
Class B Addresses
Class B addresses range from 128 (10000000) to 191 (10111111) in the ﬁrst byte. Network numbers 
assigned to companies or other organizations are from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0. This section 
discusses the 16 networks reserved for private use later.
By default, for Class B addresses, the ﬁrst two bytes are the network number and the remaining two 
bytes are the host number. The format is N.N.H.H. With 16 bits available, there are 216 – 2 = 65,534 
IP addresses for host assignment per Class B network. As with Class A addresses, having a segment 
with more than 65,000 hosts broadcasting will surely not work; you resolve this issue with 
subnetting.
Class C Addresses
Class C addresses range from 192 (11000000) to 223 (11011111) in the ﬁrst byte. Network numbers 
assigned to companies are from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0. The format is N.N.N.H. With 8 bits 
available, there are 28 – 2 = 254 IP addresses for host assignment per Class C network. H=0 is the 
network number; H=255 is the broadcast address.
Class D Addresses
Class D addresses range from 224 (11100000) to 239 (11101111) in the ﬁrst byte. Network numbers 
assigned to multicast groups range from 224.0.0.1 to 239.255.255.255. These addresses do not have 
a host or network part. Some multicast addresses are already assigned; for example, 224.0.0.10 is 
used by routers running EIGRP.

IPv4 Addressing     211
Class E Addresses
Class E addresses range from 240 (11110000) to 254 (11111110) in the ﬁrst byte. These addresses 
are reserved for experimental networks. Network 255 is reserved for the broadcast address, such as 
255.255.255.255. Table 9-6 summarizes the IPv4 address classes.
IPv4 Private Addresses
Some network numbers within the IPv4 address space are reserved for private use. These numbers 
are not routed on the Internet. Many organizations today use private addresses in their internal 
networks with network NAT to access the Internet. (NAT is covered later in this chapter.) Private 
addresses are explained in RFC 1918, Address Allocation for Private Internets, published in 1996. 
Private addresses were one of the ﬁrst steps dealing with the concern that globally unique IPv4 
address space would become exhausted. The availability of private addresses combined with NAT 
reduces the need for organizations to carefully deﬁne subnets to minimize the waste of assigned, 
public, global IP addresses.
The IP network address space reserved for private Internets is 10/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16. It 
includes one Class A network, 16 Class B networks, and 256 Class C networks. Table 9-7 
summarizes private address space.

NAT
NAT devices convert internal IP address space into globally unique IP addresses. NAT was origi-
nally speciﬁed by RFC 1631, which was made obsolete by RFC 3022. Companies use NAT to 
translate internal private addresses to public addresses.
The translation can be from many private addresses to a single public address or from many private 
addresses to a range of public addresses. When NAT performs many-to-one, the process is called 
port address translation (PAT) because different port numbers identify translations.
As shown in Figure 9-4, the source address for outgoing IP packets are converted to globally unique 
IP addresses. The conversion can be conﬁgured statically or it can dynamically use a global pool of 
addresses.
Figure 9-4
Network Address Translation
There are several forms of NAT, such as those described in the following list:
I
Static NAT—Maps an unregistered IP address to a registered IP address, conﬁgured manually.
I
Dynamic NAT—Dynamically maps an unregistered IP address to a registered IP address from 
a pool (group) of registered addresses. There are two subsets of dynamic NAT: overloading and 
overlapping.
— Overloading—Maps multiple unregistered IP addresses to a single registered IP address 
by using different ports. It is also known as PAT, single-address NAT, or port-level 
multiplexed NAT.
— Overlapping—Maps registered internal IP addresses to outside registered IP addresses. It 
can also map external addresses to internal registered addresses.
When designing for NAT, you should understand the following terminology:
I
Stub domain—The internal network that might be using private IP addresses.
I
Public network—Outside the stub domain, it resides in the Internet. Addresses in the public 
network are reachable from the Internet.

IP Address Subnets     213
I
Inside local address—The real IP address of the device that resides in the internal network. 
This address is used in the stub domain.
I
Inside global address—The translated IP address of the device that resides in the internal 
network. This address is used in the public network.
I
Outside global address—The real IP address of a device that resides in the Internet, outside of 
the stub domain.
I
Outside local address—The translated IP address of the device that resides in the Internet. This 
address is used inside the stub domain.
Figure 9-5 illustrates the terms described in the list. The real IP address of the host in the stub 
network is 192.168.10.100; it is the inside local address. The NAT router translates the inside local 
address into the inside global address (200.100.10.100). Hosts located in the Internet have their real 
IP address (outside global address) translated; in the example, 30.100.2.50 is translated into the 
outside local address of 192.168.100.50.
Figure 9-5
Terminology Example
IP Address Subnets
Subnetting plays an important part in IP addressing. The subnet mask helps determine the network, 
subnetwork, and host part of an IP address. The network architect uses subnetting to manipulate the 
default mask to create subnetworks for LAN and WAN segments. These subnetworks provide 
enough addresses for LANs of different sizes. Point-to-point WAN links usually get a subnet mask 
for two hosts because only two routers are present in the point-to-point WAN link. You should 
become familiar with determining subnetwork numbers, broadcast addresses, and host-address 
ranges given an IP address and mask.
Subnet masks are used for Class A, B, and C addresses only. Multicast addresses do not use subnet 
masks. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number where bits are set to 1 to establish the network portion of 
the address, and a 0 is the host part of the address. The mask’s bits set to 1 are contiguous from the 
left portion of the mask; the bits set to 0 are contiguous to the right portion of the mask. Table 9-5 
shows the default masks for Class A, B, and C addresses. This section addresses various ways to

represent IP subnet masks. Understanding these ways is signiﬁcant because the representation of a 
network and its mask can appear differently in Cisco documentation or on the command-line 
interface.
Mask Nomenclature
There are several ways to represent IP subnet masks. The mask can be binary, hexadecimal, or 
dotted-decimal or a preﬁx “bit mask.” Historically, the most common representation is the dotted-
decimal format (255.255.255.0). The preﬁx bit mask format is now more popular. This format 
represents the mask by using a slash followed by the number of leading address bits that must be 
set to 1 for the mask. For example, 255.255.0.0 is represented as /16. Table 9-9 shows some mask 
representations.

IP Address Subnets     215
IP Address Design Example
Say a company of 200 hosts is assigned the Class C network of 195.10.1.0/24. The 200 hosts are in 
6 different LANs. You can subnet the Class C network using a mask of 255.255.255.224. Looking 
at the mask in binary (11111111 11111111 11111111 11100000), the ﬁrst three bytes are the net-
work part, the ﬁrst three bits of the fourth byte determine the subnets, and the ﬁve remaining 0 bits 
are for host addressing.
Table 9-10 shows the subnetworks created with a mask of 255.255.255.224. Using this mask, 2n 
subnets are created, where n is the number of the bits taken from the host part for the subnet mask. 
This example uses 3 bits, so 23 = 8 subnets. With Cisco routers, you can use the all 1s subnet 
(LAN 7) for a subnet. You cannot use the 0s subnet by default, but with Cisco routers, you can 
use it by conﬁguring the ip subnet-zero command.
Use the following formula to calculate the number of hosts per subnet: 2n – 2, where n is the number 
of bits for the host portion. The preceding example has 5 bits in the fourth byte for host addresses. 
With n = 5, then 25 – 2 = 30 hosts. For LAN 1, host addresses range from 195.10.1.33 to 195.10.1.62 
(30 addresses).
The example uses a ﬁxed-length subnet mask. The whole Class C network has the same subnet 
mask, 255.255.255.224. Routing protocols such as RIPv1 and IGRP can only use ﬁxed-length 
subnet masks; they do not support VLSMs in which masks of different lengths identify subnets 
within network. VLSMs are covered later in this chapter.

Determining the Network Portion of an IP Address
Given an address and mask, you can determine the classful network, the subnetwork, and the 
broadcast number of the subnetwork. You do so with a logical AND operation between the IP 
address and subnet mask. Obtain the broadcast address by taking the subnet number and making the 
host portion all 1s. Table 9-11 shows the logical AND operation. Notice that the AND operation is 
similar to multiplying Bit 1 and Bit 2; if any 0 is present, the result is 0.
As an example, take the IP address 150.85.1.70 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224, as shown 
in Table 9-12. Notice the three bold bits in the subnet mask. These bits extend the default Class C 
preﬁx (/24) 3 bits to a mask of /27. As shown in Table 9-12, perform an AND operation of the IP 
address with the subnet mask to obtain the subnetwork. You obtain the broadcast number by making 
all the host bits 1.
VLSMs
VLSMs divide a network into subnets of various sizes to prevent wasting IP addresses. If a Class C 
network uses 255.255.255.240 as a subnet mask, there will be 16 subnets, each with 14 IP addresses. 
If there is a point-to-point link that needs only two IP addresses, 12 IP addresses are wasted. This 
problem scales further with Class B and Class A address space. With VLSMs, small LANs can use

IP Address Subnets     217
/28 subnets with 14 hosts, and larger LANs can use /23 or /22 masks with 510 and 1022 hosts. Point-
to-point networks use a /30 mask, which supports two hosts.
VLSM Address-Assignment Example
Take Class B network 110.20.0.0/16 as an example. Using a /20 mask produces 16 subnetworks. 
Table 9-13 shows the subnetworks. With the /20 subnet mask, the ﬁrst 4 bits of the third byte 
determine the subnets.
With ﬁxed-length subnet masks, the network would support only 16 networks. Any LAN or WAN 
link would have to use a /20 subnet. This scenario is a waste of address space—not efﬁcient. With 
VLSMs, you can further subnet the /20 subnets.

218     Chapter 9: Internet Protocol Version 4
For example, take 110.20.64.0/20 and subdivide it to support LANs with around 500 hosts. With a 
/23 mask, there are 9 bits for hosts, producing 29 – 2 = 510 IP addresses for hosts. Table 9-14 shows 
the subnetworks for LANs within a speciﬁed subnet.
With VLSMs, you can even further divide these subnetworks of subnetworks. Take subnetwork 
110.20.76.0/23 and use it for two LANs that have fewer than 250 hosts. It produces subnetworks 
110.20.76.0/24 and 110.20.77.0/24. Also, subdivide 110.20.78.0/23 for serial links. Because each 
point-to-point serial link needs only two IP addresses, use a /30 mask. Table 9-15 shows the 
subnetworks produced.

IP Address Subnets     219
Each /30 subnetwork includes the subnetwork number, two IP addresses, and a broadcast address. 
Table 9-16 shows the bits for 110.20.78.8/30.
Loopback Addresses
You can also reserve a subnet for router loopback addresses. Loopback addresses provide an always-
up interface to use for router-management connectivity. The loopback address can also serve as the 
router ID for some routing protocols. The loopback address is a single IP address with a 32-bit mask. 
In the previous example, network 110.20.75.0/24 could provide 255 loopback addresses for network 
devices starting with 110.20.75.1/32 and ending with 110.20.75.255/32.
IP Telephony Networks
You should reserve separate subnets for LANs using IP phones. IP phones are normally placed in 
an auxiliary VLAN that is in a separate logical segment from that of the user workstations. Separat-
ing voice and data on different subnets or VLANs also aids in providing QoS for voice trafﬁc in 
regards to classifying, queuing, and buffering. This design rule facilitates troubleshooting.
CIDR and Summarization
CIDR permits the address aggregation of classful networks. It does so by using the common bits to 
join networks. The network addresses need to be contiguous and have a common bit boundary.
With CIDR, ISPs assign groups of Class C networks to enterprise customers. This arrangement 
eliminates the problem of assigning too large of a network (Class B) or assigning multiple Class C 
networks to a customer and having to maintain an entry for each Class C network in the routing 
tables. It reduces the size of the Internet routing tables. 
You can summarize four contiguous Class C networks at the /22 bit level. For example, networks 
200.1.100.0, 200.1.101.0, 200.1.102.0, and 200.1.103.0 share common bits, as shown in Table 9-17. 
The resulting network is 200.1.100.0/22, which you can use for a 1000-node network.

It is important for an Internet network designer to assign IP networks in a manner that permits 
summarization. It is preferred that a neighboring router receive one summarized route, rather than 
8, 16, 32, or more routes, depending on the level of summarization. This setup reduces the size of 
the routing tables in the network.
For route summarization to work, the multiple IP addresses must share the same leftmost bits and 
routers must base their routing decisions on the IP address and preﬁx length. 
Figure 9-6 shows an example of route summarization. All the edge routers send network information 
to their upstream routers. Router E summarizes its two LAN networks by sending 192.168.16.0/23 
to Router A. Router F summarizes its two LAN networks by sending 192.168.18.0/23. Router B 
summarizes the networks it receives from Router C and D. Routers B, E, and F send their routes to 
Router A. Router A sends a single route (192.168.16.0/21) to its upstream router, instead of sending 
eight routes. This process reduces the number of networks that upstream routers need to include in 
routing updates.

Address Assignment and Name Resolution     221
Notice on Table 9-17 that all the Class C networks share a bit boundary with 21 common bits. The 
networks are different on the 22nd bit and thus cannot be summarized beyond the 21st bit. All these 
networks are summarized with 192.168.16.0/21.
Address Assignment and Name Resolution
IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers can be assigned statically or dynam-
ically. You should statically assign most shared network systems, such as routers and servers, but 
dynamically assign most client systems. This section covers the protocols you use to dynamically 
assign IP address parameters to a host, which are the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and the Dynamic 
Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP). This section also covers DNS and ARP, which are two sig-
niﬁcant protocols in IP networks. DNS maps domain names to IP addresses, and ARP resolves IP 
addresses to MAC addresses.  These protocols are important in TCP/IP networks because they sim-
plify the methods for address assignment and resolution.
Static and Dynamic IP Address Assignment
Assign the IP addresses of routers, switches, printers, and servers statically. You need to manage and 
monitor these systems, so you must access them via a stable IP address.
You should dynamically assign end client workstations to reduce the conﬁguration tasks required to 
connect these systems to the network. When you assign client workstation characteristics dynami-
cally, the system automatically learns which network segment it is assigned to and how to reach its 
default gateway as the network is discovered. One of the ﬁrst methods used to dynamically assign 
IP addresses was BOOTP. The current method to assign IP addresses is DHCP.

222     Chapter 9: Internet Protocol Version 4
BOOTP
The basic BOOTP was ﬁrst deﬁned in RFC 951. It has been updated by RFC 1497 and RFC 1542. 
It is a protocol that allows a booting host to conﬁgure itself by dynamically obtaining its IP address, 
IP gateway, and other information from a remote server. You can use a single server to centrally 
manage numerous network hosts without having to conﬁgure each host independently.
BOOTP is an application-layer protocol that uses UDP/IP protocols for transport. UDP Port 67 
sends BOOTP request to the BOOTP server, and the server uses UDP Port 68 to send messages to 
the UDP client. The destination IP of the BOOTP requests uses the all-hosts address (255.255.255.255), 
which is not forwarded by the router. If the BOOTP server is one or more router hops from the 
subnet, you must conﬁgure the local default gateway router to forward the BOOTP requests.
BOOTP requires that you build a MAC-address-to-IP-address table on the server. You must obtain 
the MAC address of every device, which is a time-consuming effort. BOOTP has been replaced by 
the more sophisticated DHCP.
DHCP
DHCP provides a way to dynamically conﬁgure hosts on the network. Based on BOOTP, it is 
deﬁned in RFC 2131 and adds the capability of reusing network addresses and additional conﬁgu-
ration options. DHCP improves on BOOTP by using a “lease” for IP addresses and providing the 
client with all of the IP conﬁguration parameters needed to operate in the network.
DHCP servers allocate network addresses and deliver conﬁguration parameters dynamically to 
hosts. With DHCP, the computer can obtain its conﬁguration information—IP address, subnet mask, 
IP default gateway, DNS servers, WINS servers, and so on—when needed. DHCP also includes 
other optional parameters that you can assign to clients. The conﬁguration information is managed 
centrally on a DHCP server.
Routers act as relay agents by passing DHCP messages between DHCP clients and servers. Because 
DHCP is an extension of BOOTP, it uses the message format deﬁned in RFC 951 for BOOTP. It uses 
the same ports as BOOTP: DHCP messages to a server use UDP Port 67, and DHCP messages sent 
to a client use UDP Port 68. Because of these similarities, the conﬁguration to support DHCP in the 
routers is the same described for BOOTP.
DHCP supports permanent allocation, where the DHCP server assigns a IP address to the client and 
the IP address is never reallocated to other clients. With a lease, DHCP can also assign IP addresses 
for a limited period of time. This dynamic-allocation mechanism can reuse the IP address after the 
lease expires.

Address Assignment and Name Resolution     223
An IP address is assigned as follows:
1.
The client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message to the local network using a 255.255.255.255 
broadcast.
2.
BOOTP relay agents (routers) can forward the DHCPDISCOVER message to the DHCP 
server in another subnet.
3.
The server sends a DHCPOFFER message to respond to the client, offering IP address, lease 
expiration, and other DHCP option information.
Other DHCP messages include
— DHCPREQUEST—The client can request additional options or an extension on its lease 
of an IP address.
— DHCPRELEASE—The client relinquishes the IP address and cancels the remaining 
lease.
4.
If the server is out of addresses or it determines that the client request is invalid, it sends a 
DHCPNAK message to the client. 
DNS
DNS servers return destination IP addresses given a domain name. DNS is a distributed database. 
Separate, independent organizations administer their assigned domain name spaces and can break 
their domains into a number of subdomains. For example, given www.cisco.com, DNS returns the 
IP address 198.133.219.25. DNS was ﬁrst speciﬁed by RFCs 882 and 883. The current speciﬁca-
tions are speciﬁed in RFCs 1034 and 1035.
DNS was implemented to overcome the limitations of managing a single text-host table. Imagine 
creating and maintaining text ﬁles with the names and IP addresses of all the hosts in the Internet! 
DNS scales host-name-to-IP-address translation by distributing responsibility for the domain name 
space. DNS follows a reversed tree structure for domain name space. IANA (http://www.iana.org) 
manages the root of the tree. The tree looks like Figure 9-7.
DNS uses TCP and UDP Port 53. UDP is the recommended transport protocol for DNS queries. 
TCP is the recommended protocol for zone transfers between DNS servers. A zone transfer occurs 
when you place a secondary server in the domain and transfer the DNS information from the pri-
mary DNS server to the secondary server. A DNS query searches for the IP address of a FQDN, such 
as www.cnn.com.

DNS Tree
ARP
When a router needs to send an IP packet over an Ethernet network, it needs to ﬁnd out what 48-bit 
MAC physical address to send the frame to. Given the destination IP, ARP obtains the destination MAC. 
The destination MAC can be a local host or the gateway router’s MAC address if the destination IP 
is across the routed network. ARP is described in RFC 826. The local host maintains an ARP table 
with a list relating IP address to MAC address.
ARP operates by having the sender broadcast an ARP request. Suppose a workstation with the IP 
address 192.168.1.22 has a packet to send to 192.168.1.17 but does not have the destination MAC 
address in its ARP table. It broadcasts an ARP request to all hosts in a subnet. The ARP request 
contains the sender’s IP and MAC address as well as the target IP address. All nodes in the broadcast 
domain receive the ARP request and process it. The device with the target IP address sends an ARP 
reply back to the sender with its MAC address information; the ARP reply is a unicast message sent 
to 192.168.1.22. The sender now has the target MAC address in its ARP cache and sends the 
frame out.

Internet Protocol Version 6
This chapter reviews the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) address structures, address assign-
ments, representations, and mechanisms used to deploy IPv6. The CCDA must understand how 
an IPv6 address is represented and the different types of IPv6 addresses. This chapter also cov-
ers the beneﬁts of IPv6 over IPv4 to provide a comparison of the protocols. 
As IPv6 matures, different deployment models will implement the new protocol with existing 
IPv4 networks. This chapter does not cover these models at a high level. This chapter does not 
discuss the conﬁguration of IPv6 because it is not a requirement for CCDA certiﬁcation.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you need to 
read the entire chapter. If you intend to read the entire chapter, you do not necessarily need to 
answer these questions now.
The 10-question quiz, derived from the major sections in the “Foundation Topics” portion of the 
chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.
Table 10-1 outlines the major topics discussed in this chapter and the “Do I Know This Already?”

The goal of self assessment is to gauge your mastery of the topics in this chapter. If 
you do not know the answer to a question or you are only partially sure of the answer, you should 
mark this question wrong for purposes of the self assessment. Giving yourself credit for an 
answer you correctly guess skews your self-assessment results and might provide you with a false 
sense of security.

Introduction to IPv6     239
Foundation Topics
The following sections cover topics that you need to master for the CCDA exam. The section “IPv6 
Header” covers each ﬁeld of the IPv6 header, which helps you understand the protocol. The section 
“IPv6 Address Representation” covers the hexadecimal representation of IPv6 addresses and the 
compressed representation. The section “IPv6 Address Types” covers unicast, multicast, and 
anycast IPv6 addresses and the current allocations of IPv6 addresses. 
The section “IPv6 Mechanisms” covers Internet Control Message Protocol Version 6 (ICMPv6), 
ND, address assignment and resolution, and IPv6 routing protocols. The section “IPv4 to IPv6 
Transition Strategies and Deployments” covers dual-stack backbones, IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels, 
dual-stack hosts, and network address translation-protocol translation (NAT-PT).
Introduction to IPv6
You should become familiar at a high level with IPv6 speciﬁcations, addressing, and design. The 
driving motivation for the adoption of a new version of IP is the limitation imposed by the 32-bit 
address ﬁeld in IPv4. In the 1990s, there was concern that the IP address space would be depleted 
soon. Although classless interdomain routing (CIDR) and NAT have slowed down the deployment 
of IPv6, its standards and deployments are becoming mature. IPv6 is playing a signiﬁcant role in 
the deployment of IP services for wireless phones; also, some countries such as Japan will have 
directed IPv6 compatibility by 2005. Several IPv6 testbeds include the 6bone and the 6ren. The 
6bone is an IPv6 testbed that focuses on testing standards, implementations, and transition and 
operational procedures. Under a new phase-out plan, the 6bone will cease to operate by July 2006. 
The 6ren is a IPv6 network that serves research and educational institutions.
The IPv6 speciﬁcation provides 128 bits for addressing, a signiﬁcant increase from 32 bits. The 
overall speciﬁcation of IPv6 is in RFC 2460. Other RFCs describing IPv6 speciﬁcations are 2373, 
2374, 2461, 1886, and 1981.
IPv6 includes the following enhancements over IPv4:
I
Expanded address space—IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses instead of the 32-bit addresses in IPv4.
I
Fixed header length—The IPv6 header length is ﬁxed, allowing for vendors to improve 
switching performance.
I
Improved option mechanism—IPv6 options are placed in separate optional headers that are 
located between the IPv6 header and the transport-layer header. The option headers are not 
required.

240     Chapter 10: Internet Protocol Version 6
I
Address autoconﬁguration—This capability provides for dynamic assignment of IPv6 
addresses. IPv6 hosts can automatically conﬁgure themselves, with or without a Dynamic Host 
Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) server. 
I
Support for labeling trafﬁc ﬂows—Instead of the type-of-service ﬁeld in IPv4, IPv6 enables 
the labeling of packets belonging to a particular trafﬁc class for which the sender requests 
special handling. This support aids specialized trafﬁc, such as real-time video.
I
Security capabilities—IPv6 includes features that support authentication and privacy. 
I
Maximum transmission unit (MTU) path discovery—IPv6 eliminates the need for 
fragmenting packets by implementing MTU path discovery before sending packets to a 
destination.
IPv6 Header
This section covers each ﬁeld of the IPv6 header. The IPv6 header is simpler than the IPv4 header. 
Some IPv4 ﬁelds have been eliminated or changed to optional ﬁelds. The fragment offset ﬁelds and 
ﬂags in IPv4 have been eliminated from the header. IPv6 adds a ﬂow label ﬁeld for quality-of-
service (QoS) mechanisms to use.
The use of 128 bits for source and destination addresses provides a signiﬁcant improvement over 
IPv4. With 128 bits, there are 3.4 x 1038 or 34 billion billion billion billion IPv6 addresses, 
compared to only 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses.
IPv6 improves over IPv4 by using a ﬁxed-length header. The IPv6 header appears in Figure 10-1.

IPv6 Address Representation     241
The following is a description of each ﬁeld in the IP header:
I
Version—This ﬁeld is 4 bits long. It indicates the format, based on the version number, of the 
IP header. These bits are set to 0110 for IPv6 packets.
I
Trafﬁc class—This ﬁeld is 8 bits in length. It describes the class or priority of the IPv6 packet 
and provides similar functionality to the IPv4 type-of-service ﬁeld.
I
Flow label—This ﬁeld is 20 bits in length. It indicates a speciﬁc sequence of packets between 
a source and destination that requires special handling, such as real-time data (voice and video).
I
Payload length—This ﬁeld is 16 bits in length. It indicates the size in bytes of the payload. Its 
length includes any extension headers.
I
Next header—This ﬁeld is 8 bits in length. It indicates the type of header that follows this IPv6 
header. It uses values deﬁned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). 
I
Hop limit—This ﬁeld is 8 bits in length. It is decremented by 1 by each router that forwards 
the packets. If this ﬁeld is 0, the packet is discarded.
I
Source address—This ﬁeld is 128 bits in length. It indicates the IPv6 address of the sender.
I
Destination address—This ﬁeld is 128 bits in length. It indicates the IPv6 address of the 
destination host.
Notice that although the IPv6 address is four times the length of an IPv4 address, the IPv6 header is 
only twice the length. Optional network-layer information is not included in the IPv6 header; 
instead it is included in separate extended headers.
Two important extended headers are the Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating 
Security Payload (ESP) header. These headers are covered later in the chapter.
IPv6 Address Representation
RFC 2373 speciﬁes the IPv6 addressing architecture. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length. For 
display, the IPv6 addresses have eight 16-bit groups. The hexadecimal value is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, 
where each x represents four hexadecimal digits.
An example of a full IPv6 address is 1111111000011010 0100001010110111 0000000000011011 
0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0001001011010000 0000000001011011 
0000011010110000.

242     Chapter 10: Internet Protocol Version 6
The hexadecimal representation of the preceding IPv6 binary number is
FE1A:42B9:001B:0000:0000:12D0:005B:06B0  
Groups with a value of zero can be represented with a single zero. For example, you can also 
represent the preceding number as
FE1A:42B9:001B:0:0:12D0:005B:06B0
You can represent multiple groups of 16-bit zeros with ::, which might appear only once in the 
number. Also, you do not need to represent leading zeros in a 16-bit piece. The preceding IPv6 
address can be further shortened to
FE1A:42B9:1B::12D0:5B:6B0
You expand a compressed address following the same rules used earlier. For example, the IPv6 
address 2001:4C::50:0:0:741 expands as follows:
2001:004C::0050:0000:0000:0741
Because there should be eight blocks of addresses and you have six, you can expand the double 
colon to two blocks as follows:
2001:004C:0000:0000:0050:0000:0000:0741
In a mixed IPv6/IPv4 environment, the IPv4 portion of the address requires the last two 16-bit 
blocks or 32 bits of the address, which is represented in IPv4 dotted-decimal notation. The 
remaining portion of the IPv6 address is all zeros. Six hexadecimal 16-bit blocks are concatenated 
with the dotted-decimal format. The ﬁrst 96 bits are zero, and the last 32 bits are used for the IPv4 
address. This form is x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d, where each x represents the hexadecimal digits and d.d.d.d 
is the dotted-decimal representation.
An example of a mixed full address is  0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:100.1.1.1; this example 
can be shortened to 0:0:0:0:0:0:100.1.1.1 or ::100.1.1.1.
IPv6 Preﬁx Representation
IPv6 preﬁxes are represented similar to IPv4 with the following format:
IPv6-address/preﬁx
TIP
Remember that there are eight blocks in the fully expanded address and that the double colon 
represents only zeros. You can use the double colon only once.

IPv6 Address Types     243
The IPv6-address portion is a valid IPv6 address. The preﬁx portion is the number of contiguous 
bits that represent the preﬁx. You use the double colon only once in the representation. An example 
of an IPv6 preﬁx is 200C:001b:1100:0:0:0:0:0/40 or 200C:1b:1100::/40.
For another example, look of the representations of the 60-bit preﬁx 2001000000000ab0:
2001:0000:0000:0ab0:0000:0000:0000:0000/60
2001:0000:0000:0ab0:0:0:0:0/60
2001:0000:0000:ab0::/60
2001:0:0:ab0::/60
The rules for address representation are still valid when using a preﬁx. The following are not valid 
representations of the preceding preﬁx:
2001:0:0:ab0/60
The preceding representation is missing the trailing double colon:
2001::ab0/60
The preceding representation expands to 2001:0:0:0:0:0:0:0ab0, which is not the preﬁx 
2001:0000:0000:0ab0::/60.
When representing an IPv6 host address with its subnet preﬁx, you combine the two. For example 
the IPv6 address 2001:0000:0000:0ab0:001c:1bc0:08ba:1c9a in subnet preﬁx 
2001:0000:0000:0ab0::/60 is represented as the following:
2001:0000:0000:0ab0:001c:1bc0:08ba:1c9a/60
IPv6 Address Types
This section covers the major types of IPv6 addresses. IPv4 addresses are unicast, multicast, or 
broadcast. IPv6 maintains each of these address functions except the IPv6 address types are deﬁned 
a little differently. A special “all-nodes” IPv6 multicast address handles the broadcast function. IPv6 
also introduces the anycast address type.
Also signiﬁcant to understand are the IPv6 address allocations. Sections of the IPv6 address space 
are reserved for particular functions, each which are covered in this section. To provide you with a 
full understanding of address types, the following sections describe each type.

244     Chapter 10: Internet Protocol Version 6
As mentioned earlier, there are three types of IPv6 addresses:
I
Unicast
I
Anycast
I
Multicast
IPv6 Unicast Address
The IPv6 unicast address is the logical identiﬁer of a single host interface. It is similar to IPv4 
unicast classful (Class A, Class B, and Class C) addresses. Unicast addresses are aggregatable-
global, site-local, or link-local. These unicast address types are explained in sections that follow.
IPv6 Anycast Address
The IPv6 anycast address identiﬁes a set of devices. An anycast address is built from a set of unicast 
addresses. You can use it to identify a set of routers within an area. When a packet is sent to the 
anycast address, it is delivered to the nearest device as determined by the routing protocol.
IPv6 Multicast Address
The IPv6 multicast address identiﬁes a set of hosts. The packet is delivered to all the hosts identiﬁed 
by that address. This type is similar to IPv4 multicast (Class D) addresses. IPv6 multicast addresses 
also supersede the broadcast function of IPv4 broadcasts. You use an “all-nodes” multicast address 
instead.
IPv6 Address Allocations
The leading bits of an IPv6 address can deﬁne the IPv6 address type or other reservations. These 
leading bits are of variable length and are called the format preﬁx (FP). Table 10-2 shows the allo-
cation of address preﬁxes. Many preﬁxes are still unassigned.

Unspeciﬁed Address
An unspeciﬁed address is all zeros: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0. It signiﬁes that an IPv6 address is not speciﬁed 
for the interface.
Loopback Address
The IPv6 loopback address is 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1. This address is similar to the IPv4 loopback address 
of 127.0.0.1.

IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Address
IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses begin with leading zeros (six 16-bit groups) followed by the IPv4 
address, as in 0:0:0:0:0:0:130.100.50.1 or just ::130.100.50.1.
IPv6 NSAP Addresses
IPv6 NSAP addresses help transition from an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) NSAP-
addressed network to a native IPv6 network. These addresses support the OSI NSAP addresses 
within an IPv6 network. IPv6 NSAP addresses are identiﬁed by the leading 0000001 bits. Using 
IPv6 NSAP addresses is not an exam topic and is not covered further in this book.
IPv6 IPX Addresses
IPv6 IPX addresses are identiﬁed by the leading 0000010 bits. The usage of these IPv6 addresses 
has not been deﬁned at this time.
Aggregatable-Global Addresses
IPv6 aggregatable-global addresses connect to the public network. These unicast addresses are 
globally unique and routable. This address format is deﬁned in RFC 2374.
The address format has a three-layer hierarchy: public topology, site topology, and interface identi-
ﬁer. The public topology consists of service providers that provide transit services and exchanges of 
routing information. The site topology is local to the company or site and does not provide transit 
services. The interface layer uniquely identiﬁes an interface on the network.
As shown in Figure 10-2, the IPv6 aggregatable-global address format consists of various ﬁelds. FP 
is the format preﬁx (001) used to identify an aggregatable address. TLA ID is the top-level aggre-
gation identiﬁer; it is the top level of the routing hierarchy. The RES ﬁeld is reserved for future use. 
The NLA ID ﬁeld is the next-level identiﬁer; it is used by organizations that have been assigned a 
TLA ID to assign a hierarchy. The SLA ID is the site-level aggregation identiﬁer; it is used by orga-
nizations to assign its own addressing hierarchy. The interface ID uniquely identiﬁes the interface 
on the link. These identiﬁers will permit Internet service providers to identify the site allocation of 
an address and permit organizations to further allocate the address space.

Link-Local Addresses
IPv6 link-local addresses are signiﬁcant only to nodes on a single link. Routers do not forward pack-
ets with a link-local source or destination address beyond the local link. Link-local addresses are 
identiﬁed by leading FE8 hexadecimal numbers. Link-local addresses are conﬁgured automatically 
or manually.
As shown in Figure 10-3, the format of the link-local address is an FP of 1111111010, followed by 
54 zeros and a 64-bit interface identiﬁer (ID). The interface ID is obtained automatically through 
communication with other nodes in the link. The interface ID is then concatenated with the link-
local address preﬁx of FE80::/64 to obtain the interface link-local address. 
Figure 10-3
IPv6 Link-Local Address Format
Site-Local Addresses 
IPv6 site-local addresses are analogous to IPv4 private addresses (RFC 1918). Site-local addresses 
are used within an organization and are not globally unique.  Site-local addresses are not routable 
across a public network such as the Internet. 
As shown in Figure 10-4, the format of the site-local address is a 10-bit FP of 1111111010, followed 
by 38 zeros, a 16-bit subnet ID, and a 64-bit interface ID.
Figure 10-4
IPv6 Site-Local Address Format
Multicast Addresses
IPv6 multicast addresses perform the same function as IPv4 multicast addresses. Multicast 
addresses send packets to all hosts in a group. IPv6 multicast addresses are identiﬁed by the leading 
FF hexadecimal numbers (an FP value of 11111111). RFC 2373 speciﬁes the format for IPv6 
multicast addresses.
As shown in Figure 10-5, the ﬁelds of the IPv6 multicast address are the FP, a value of 0xFF, 
followed by a 4-bit ﬂags ﬁeld, a 4-bit scope ﬁeld, and 112 bits for the group identiﬁer (ID).

Multicast Address Format
The FLGS (ﬂags) ﬁeld consists of three leading zeros followed by a T bit: 000T. If T = 0, the address 
is a well-known multicast address assigned by the global IANA. If T = 1, the address is not a per-
manently assigned address.
The SCOP (scope) ﬁeld limits the scope of the multicast group. Table 10-3 shows the assigned scope 
values.

IPv6 Mechanisms     249
The group ID identiﬁes the multicast group within the given scope. The group ID is independent of 
the scope. A group ID of 0:0:0:0:0:0:1 identiﬁes nodes, whereas a group of ID of 0:0:0:0:0:0:2 
identiﬁes routers. Some well-known multicast addresses appear in Table 10-4 associated with a 
variety of scope values.
IPv6 Mechanisms
The changes of the 128-bit address length and IPv6 header format modiﬁed the underlying protocols 
that support IP. This section covers ICMPv6, IPv6 ND, address resolution, address assignment, and 
IPv6 routing protocols. These protocols must now support 128-bit addresses; for example, DNS 
adds a new record locator for resolving fully qualiﬁed domain names (FQDNs) to IPv6 addresses. 
IPv6 also replaces ARP with the IPv6 ND protocol. IPv6 ND uses ICMPv6.
ICMPv6
The ICMP needed some modiﬁcations to support IPv6. RFC 2463 describes the use of ICMPv6 
for IPv6 networks. All IPv6 nodes must implement ICMPv6 to perform network-layer functions. 
ICMPv6 performs diagnostics (ping), reports errors, and provides reachability information.

IPv6 ND
IPv6 does not implement the ARP that is used in IPv4. Instead, IPv6 implements the ND protocol 
described in RFC 2461. Hosts use ND to discover all other nodes in the same link, check for dupli-
cate addresses, and ﬁnd routers in the link. The protocol also searches for alternative routers if the 
primary fails.
The address-resolution process uses neighbor-solicitation messages to obtain the link-layer address 
of a neighbor. Nodes respond with a neighbor-advertisement message that contains the link-layer 
address.
IPv6 Name Resolution
IPv4 uses ARP for resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses. IPv6 uses ND to map IPv6 addresses 
to MAC addresses. DNS adds a resource record to support name-to-IPv6-address resolution. RFC 
1886 describes the addition of a new DNS resource record type to support IPv6 name resolution. 
The new record type is AAAA, commonly known as “quad-A.” Given a domain name, the AAAA 
record returns an IPv6 address to the requesting host. DNS A records return an IPv4 address. The 
node’s DNS resolver must be able to handle both A and AAAA records with dual-stacks.

IPv6 Mechanisms     251
Path MTU Discovery
IPv6 does not allow fragmentation of packets throughout the internetwork. Only sending hosts are 
allowed to fragment. Routers are not allowed to perform fragmentation of packets. RFC 2460 spec-
iﬁes that the MTU of every link in an IPv6 must be 1280 bytes or greater.  RFC 1981 recommends 
that nodes should implement IPv6 path MTU discovery to determine whether there are paths greater 
than 1280 bytes. ICMPv6 packet-too-big error messages determine the path MTU. Nodes along the 
path send the ICMPv6 packet-too-big message to the sending host if the packet is larger than the 
outgoing interface MTU.
Figure 10-6 shows a host sending a 2000-byte packet. Because the outgoing interface MTU is 1500 bytes, 
Router A sends an ICMPv6 packet-too-big error message back to Host A. The sending host then 
sends a 1500-byte packet. The outgoing interface MTU at Router B is 1300 bytes. Router B sends 
a ICMPv6 packet-too-big error message to Host A. Host A then sends the packet with 1300 bytes.
Figure 10-6
ICMPv6 Packet-Too-Big Message
IPv6 Address-Assignment Strategies
An IPv6 host can obtain its address through autoconﬁguration or from the DHCP.  DHCP is a 
stateful method of address assignment. IPv6 nodes might or might not use DHCP to acquire 
IP address information.  
Autoconﬁguration
IPv6 hosts can use a stateless autoconﬁguration method, without DHCP, to acquire their own 
IP address information. Hosts obtain their link-local addresses automatically as an interface is ini-
tialized. First, the host performs a duplicate address-detection process. The host joins the all-nodes 
multicast group to receive neighbor advertisements from other nodes. The neighbor advertisements 
include the subnet or preﬁx associated with the link. The host then sends a neighbor-solicitation

message with the tentative IP address (interface identiﬁer) as the target. If there is a host already 
using the tentative IP address, that host replies with a neighbor advertisement. If the host receives 
no neighbor advertisement, the target IP address becomes the link-local address of the originating 
host.
IPv6 Security
IPv6 has two integrated mechanisms to provide security for communications. It natively supports 
IPSecurity (IPSec). IPSec is mandated at the operating-system level for all IPSec hosts. RFC 2401 
describes IPSec. Extension headers carry the IPSec AH and ESP header. The AH provides authen-
tication and integrity. The ESP header provides conﬁdentiality by encrypting the payload. For IPv6, 
the AH defaults to message digest algorithm 5 (MD5), and the ESP encryption defaults to data 
encryption standard-cipher block chaining (DES-CBC).
A description of the mechanisms of IPSec appear in Chapter 8, “VPN and DSL WAN Design.” More 
information also appears in RFC 2402, IP Authentication Header and RFC 2406, IP Encapsulating 
Security Payload (ESP).
IPv6 Routing Protocols
New routing protocols are being developed to support IPv6, such as RIPng, Integrated/ Intermediate 
System-to-Intermediate System (i/IS-IS), and OSPFv3. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) also 
includes changes that support IPv6. In the future, a newer version of Enhanced Interior Gateway 
Routing Protocol (EIGRP) will support IPv6.
RIPng for IPv6
RFC 2080 describes changes to the RIP to support IPv6 networks, called RIP next generation (RIPng). 
RIP mechanisms remain the same. RIPng still has a 15-hop limit, counting to inﬁnity, and uses User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 521. RIPng version supports IPv6 addresses and preﬁxes. Cisco IOS 
Software currently supports RIPng.
OSPFv3 for IPv6
RFC 2740 describes OSPF Version 3 to support IPv6 networks. OSPF algorithms and mechanisms 
(ﬂooding, designated router [DR] election, areas, short path ﬁrst [SFP] calculations) remain the 
same. Changes are made for OSPF to support IPv6 addresses and address hierarchy. Cisco IOS 
Software currently supports OSPFv3.

IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Strategies and Deployments     253
IS-IS for IPv6
Speciﬁcations for routing IPv6 with integrated IS-IS is currently an Internet draft of the IETF. 
The draft speciﬁes new type, length, and value (TLV) objects, reachability TLVs, and an interface 
address TLV to forward IPv6 information in the network. IOS currently supports IS-IS for IPv6 as 
currently described in the draft standard.
BGP4 Multiprotocol Extensions for IPv6
RFC 2545 speciﬁes the use of BGP attributes for passing on IPv6 route information. The 
MP_REACH_NLRI (multiprotocol-reachable) attribute describes reachable destinations. It 
includes the next-hop address and a list of Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) preﬁxes 
of reachable networks. The MP_UNREACH_NLRI (multiprotocol-unreachable) attribute conveys 
unreachable networks. IOS currently supports these BGP4 multiprotocol attributes to communicate 
reachability information for IPv6 networks.
IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Strategies and Deployments
Several deployment models exist to migrate from an IPv4 network to IPv6. During a transition time, 
both protocols can coexist in the network. The deployment models are
I
IPv6 over dedicated WAN links
I
IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels
I
IPv6 using dual-stack backbones
I
Protocol translation
Each model provides several advantages and disadvantages with which you should become familiar. 
The sections that follow describe each model.
IPv6 over Dedicated WAN Links
In this deployment model, all nodes and links use IPv6 hierarchy, addressing, and protocols. The 
WAN in this model uses IPv6. The disadvantage of this model is that there are additional costs when 
using separate links for IPv6 WAN circuits during the transition to using IPv6 exclusively. As shown 
in Figure 10-7, a company needs both IPv6 and IPv4 networks in sites A and B during the IPv6 
deployment and transition. The networks are connected using separate WANs.

254     Chapter 10: Internet Protocol Version 6
Figure 10-7
Dedicated IPv6 WAN 
IPv6 over IPv4 Tunnels
In this deployment model, pockets of IPv6-only networks are connected using IPv4 tunnels. With 
tunneling, IPv6 trafﬁc is encapsulated within IPv4 packets so that they are sent over the IPv4 WAN. 
The advantage of this method is that you do not need separate circuits to connect the IPv6 networks. 
A disadvantage of this method is the increased protocol overhead of the encapsulated IPv6 headers. 
Figure 10-8 shows a network using IPv4 tunnels. Site A and Site B both have IPv4 and IPv6 
networks. The IPv6 networks are connected using an IPv4 tunnel in the WAN.

IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Strategies and Deployments     255
Dual-Stack Backbones
In this model, all routers in the backbone are dual-stack, capable of routing both IPv4 and IPv6 
packets. The IPv4 protocol stack is used between IPv4 hosts, and the IPv6 protocol stack is used 
between IPv6 hosts. This deployment model works for organizations with a mixture of IPv4 and 
IPv6 applications. Figure 10-9 shows a network with a dual-stack backbone. All the WAN routers 
run both IPv4 and IPv6 routing protocols. The disadvantages are that the WAN routers require dual 
addressing, run two routing protocols, and might require additional CPU and memory resources. 
Another disadvantage is that IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts cannot communicate with each other 
directly; dual-stack hosts or network translation is required (covered next) for IPv4 and IPv6 hosts 
to communicate.
Figure 10-9
Dual-Stack Backbone
Hosts require dual stacks (IPv4 and IPv6) to communicate with both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts. When 
using dual stacks, a host uses DNS to determine which stack to use to reach a destination. If DNS 
returns an IPv6 (AAAA record) address to the host, the host uses the IPv6 stack. If DNS returns an 
IPv4 (A record) address to the host, the host uses the IPv4 stack. 
Protocol Translation Mechanisms
One of the mechanisms for an IPv6-only host to communicate with an IPv4-only host without 
using dual stacks is protocol translation. RFC 2766 describes NAT-PT, which provides translation 
between IPv6 and IPv4 hosts. NAT-PT operates similarly to the NAT mechanisms to translate IPv4 
private addresses to public address space. NAT-PT binds addresses in the IPv6 network to addresses 
in the IPv4 network and vice versa. Figure 10-10 shows a network using NAT-PT.

IPv6 Comparison with IPv4
This section provides a summary comparison of IPv6 to IPv4. Become knowledgeable about the 
characteristics summarized in Table 10-5. The use of 128 bits over 32 bits is an obvious change. The 
upper-layer protocol is identiﬁed with the next header ﬁeld in IPv6, which was the protocol type 
ﬁeld used in IPv4. ARP is replaced by IPv6 ND. Site-local addresses provide the function that IPv4 
RFC 1918 private addresses provide.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
The CCDA exam requires that you be familiar with the three types of IPv6 addresses:
I
Unicast—The logical identiﬁer of a single host. Unicast addresses are aggregatable-global, 
site-local, or link-local.
I
Anycast—Identiﬁes a set of devices. The packet is delivered to the nearest device as 
determined by the routing protocol.
I
Multicast—Identiﬁes a set of hosts. The packet is delivered to all the hosts.

268     Chapter 11: Routing Protocol Selection Criteria
Foundation Topics
This chapter covers the high-level characteristics of routing protocols and their metrics. You should 
become familiar with the different categories of routing protocols and their characteristics for the 
test. Understand how each metric is used and, based on the metric, which path is preferred. For 
example, you need to know that a path with the highest bandwidth is preferred over a path with 
lower bandwidth. This chapter also covers on-demand routing (ODR).
Routing Protocol Characteristics
This section discusses the different types and characteristics of routing protocols.
Characteristics in routing-protocol design are
I
Distance-vector, link-state, or hybrid—How routes are learned
I
Interior or exterior—For use in private networks or the public Internet 
I
Classless (classless interdomain routing (CIDR) support) or classful—Enables aggregation 
of network advertisements (supernetting) between routers
I
Fixed-length or variable-length subnet masks (VLSMs)—Conserves addresses within a 
network
I
Flat or potentially hierarchical—Addresses scalability in large internetworks
This section also covers the default administrative distance assigned to routes learned from each 
routing protocol or from static assignment. Routes are categorized as statically (manually) conﬁg-
ured or dynamically learned from a routing protocol. The sections that follow cover all these 
characteristics. 
Static Versus Dynamic Route Assignment
Static routes are manually conﬁgured on a router. They do not react to network outages. The one 
exception is when the static route speciﬁes the outbound interface: If the interface goes down, the 
static route is removed from the routing table. Because static routes are unidirectional, they must be 
conﬁgured for each outgoing interface the router will use. The size of today’s networks makes it 
impossible to manually conﬁgure and maintain all the routes in all the routers in a timely manner. 
Human conﬁguration can involve many mistakes, which is why routing protocols exist. They use 
algorithms to advertise and learn about changes in the network topology.
The main beneﬁt of static routing is that a router generates no routing protocol overhead. Because 
no routing protocol is enabled, no bandwidth is consumed by route advertisements between network

devices. Static routing is recommended for hub-and-spoke topologies with a low-speed remote 
connection. A default static route is conﬁgured at each remote site because the hub is the only route 
used to reach all other sites. Figure 11-1 shows a hub-and-spoke WAN where static routes are 
deﬁned in the remote WAN routers because no routing protocols are conﬁgured. This setup 
eliminates routing-protocol trafﬁc on the low-bandwidth WAN circuits.
Figure 11-1
Static Routes in a Hub-and-Spoke Network
Routing protocols dynamically determine the best route to a destination. When the network topol-
ogy changes, the routing protocol adjusts the routes without administrative intervention. Routing 
protocols use a metric to determine the best path toward a destination network. Some use a single 
measured value such as hop count. Others compute a metric value using one or more parameters.

Interior Versus Exterior Routing Protocols
Routing protocols are interior gateway protocols (IGPs) or exterior gateway protocols (EGPs). IGPs 
are meant for routing within an organization’s administrative domain—in other words, the organi-
zation’s internal network. EGPs are routing protocols used to communicate with exterior domains. 
Figure 11-2 shows where an internetwork uses IGPs and EGPs with multiple autonomous adminis-
trative domains. BGP exchanges routing information between the internal network and an ISP. IGPs 
appear in the internal private network.

Routing Protocol Characteristics     271
Distance-Vector Routing Protocols
The ﬁrst IGP routing protocols introduced were distance-vector routing protocols. They used the 
Bellman-Ford algorithm to build the routing tables. With distance-vector routing protocols, routes 
are advertised as vectors of distance and direction. The distance metric is usually router hop count. 
The direction is the next-hop router (IP address) toward which to forward the packet. For RIP, the 
maximum number of hops is 15, which can be a serious limitation, especially in large 
nonhierarchical internetworks.
Distance-vector algorithms call for each router to send all its routing table to only its immediate 
neighbors. The table is sent periodically (30 seconds for RIP and 60 seconds for IGRP). In the period 
between advertisements, each router builds a new table to send to its neighbors at the end of the 
period. Having to wait half a minute for a new routing table with new routes is too long for today’s 
networks. RIP and IGRP send triggered updates, full routing table updates sent before the update 
timer has expired. A router can receive a routing table with 500 routes with only one route change, 
which creates serious overhead on the network—another drawback. 
The following is a list of IP distance-vector routing protocols:
I
RIPv1 and RIPv2
I
IGRP
I
EIGRP (which could be considered a hybrid)
EIGRP
EIGRP is a hybrid routing protocol. It is a distance-vector protocol that implements some link-state 
routing protocol characteristics. Although using similar metrics as its predecessor, IGRP, EIGRP 
sends partial updates and maintains neighbor state information just as link-state protocols do. 
EIGRP does not send periodic updates as other distance-vector routing protocols do. The important 
thing to consider for the test is that EIGRP could be presented as a hybrid protocol. EIGRP metrics 
and mechanisms are discussed in Chapter 12, “RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design.”
Link-State Routing Protocols
Link-state routing protocols address some of the limitations of distance-vector protocols. When 
running a link-state routing protocol, routers originate information about themselves (IP addresses), 
their connected links (the number and type of links), and the state of those links (up or down). The 
information is ﬂooded to all routers in the network as changes in the link state occur. Each router 
makes a copy of the information received and forwards it without change. Each router independently 
calculates the best paths to each destination network, using a spanning tree with itself as the root, 
and maintains a map of the network.

OSPF and IS-IS are covered in Chapter 13, “OSPF and IS-IS.”
Distance-Vector Routing Protocols Versus Link-State Protocols
When choosing a routing protocol, consider that distance-vector routing protocols use more 
network bandwidth than link-state protocols. Distance-vector protocols generate more bandwidth 
overhead because of the large periodic routing updates. Link-state routing protocols do not generate 
signiﬁcant routing update overhead but do use more router CPU and memory resources than 
distance-vector protocols. Generally, WAN bandwidth is a more expensive resource than router 
CPU and memory in modern devices.
Hierarchical Versus Flat Routing Protocols
Some routing protocols require a network topology that must have a backbone network deﬁned. 
This network contains some, or all, of the routers in the internetwork. When the internetwork is 
deﬁned hierarchically, the backbone consists of only some devices. Backbone routers service and 
coordinate the routes and trafﬁc to or from routers not in the local internetwork. The supported 
hierarchy is relatively shallow. Two levels of hierarchy are generally sufﬁcient to provide scalability. 
Selected routers forward routes into the backbone. OSPF and IS-IS are examples of hierarchical 
routing protocols.
Flat routing protocols do not allow a hierarchical network organization. Carefully designing 
network addressing to naturally support aggregation within routing-protocol advertisements can 
provide many of the beneﬁts offered by hierarchical routing protocols. Every router is a peer of any 
other router in ﬂat routing protocols; no router has a special role in the internetwork. RIP is an 
example of a ﬂat routing protocol.
Classless Versus Classful Routing Protocols
Routing protocols can be classiﬁed based on their support for VLSM and CIDR. Classful routing 
protocols do not advertise subnet masks in their routing updates; therefore, the conﬁgured subnet 
mask for the IP network must be the same throughout the entire internetwork. Further, the subnets 
must, for all practical purposes, be contiguous within the larger internetwork. For example, if you 
use a classful routing protocol for network 130.170.0.0, you must use the chosen mask (such as 

Routing Protocol Characteristics     273
255.255.255.0) on all router interfaces using the 130.170.0.0 network. You must conﬁgure serial 
links with only two hosts and LANs with tens or hundreds of devices with the same mask of 
255.255.255.0. The grand disadvantage with classful routing protocols is that the network designer 
cannot take advantage of address summarization across networks (CIDR) or allocation of smaller 
or larger subnets within an IP network (VLSM). For example, with a classful routing protocol that 
uses a default mask of /25 for the entire network, you cannot assign a /30 subnet to a serial point-
to-point circuit. Classful routing protocols are
I
RIPv1
I
IGRP
Classless routing protocols advertise the subnet mask with each route. You can conﬁgure subnet-
works of a given IP network number with different subnet masks (VLSM). You can conﬁgure large 
LANs with a smaller subnet mask and conﬁgure serial links with a larger subnet mask, thereby con-
serving IP address space. Classless routing protocols also allow ﬂexible route summarization and 
supernetting (CIDR). You create supernets by aggregating classful IP networks. For example, 
200.100.100.0/23 is a supernet of 200.100.100.0/24 and 200.100.101.0/24. Classless routing

Administrative Distance
On Cisco routers running more than one routing protocol, it is possible for two different routing pro-
tocols to have a route to the same destination. Cisco routers assign each routing protocol an admin-
istrative distance. When multiple routes exist for a destination, the router selects the longest preﬁx. 
In the event that two or more routing protocols offer the same route (with same preﬁx length) for 
inclusion in the routing table, the Cisco IOS router selects the route with the lowest administrative 
distance. The administrative distance is a rating of the trustworthiness of a routing information 
source. Table 11-2 shows the default administrative distance for conﬁgured (static) or learned 
routes. In the table, you can see that static routes are trusted over dynamically learned routes. Within 
IGP routing protocols, EIGRP internal routes are trusted over OSPF, ISIS, and RIP routes.

274     Chapter 11: Routing Protocol Selection Criteria
The administrative distance establishes the precedence used among routing algorithms. Suppose a 
router has an EIGRP route to network 172.20.10.0/24 with the best path out Ethernet 0 and an OSPF 
route for the same network out Ethernet 1. Because EIGRP has an administrative distance of 90 and 
OSPF has an administrative distance of 110, the router will enter the EIGRP route in the routing 
table and send packets with destinations of 172.20.10.0/24 out Ethernet 0.
Static routes have a default administrative distance of 1. There is one exception. If the static route 
points to a connected interface, it inherits the administrative distance of connected interfaces, which 
is 0. You can conﬁgure static routes with a different distance by appending the distance value to the 
end of the command. 
Routing Protocol Metrics and Loop Prevention
Routing protocols use a metric to determine best routes to a destination. Some routing protocols use 
a combination of metrics to build a composite metric for best path selection. This section describes 
metrics and also covers routing loop-prevention techniques. You must understand each metric for 
the CCDA.

Maximum transmission unit (MTU)
Hop Count
The hop-count parameter counts the number of links between routers the packet must traverse to 
reach a destination. The RIP routing protocols use hop count as the metric for route selection. If 
all links were the same bandwidth, this metric would work well. The problem with routing protocols 
that use only this metric is that the shortest hop count is not always the most appropriate path. For 
example, between two paths to a destination network, one with two 56 Kbps links and another with 
four T1 links, the router chooses the ﬁrst path because of the lower number of hops (see Figure 11-3). 
However, it is not necessarily the best path. You would prefer to transfer a 20 MB ﬁle via the T1 
links instead of the 56 Kbps links.
Figure 11-3
Hop Count Metric
Bandwidth
The bandwidth parameter uses the interface bandwidth to determine a best path to a destination 
network. When bandwidth is the metric, the router prefers the path with the highest bandwidth to 
a destination. For example, a Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) is preferred over a DS-3 (45 Mbps). As 
shown in Figure 11-3, a router using bandwidth to determine a path would select Path 2 because of 
the larger bandwidth, 1.5 Mbps over 56 Kbps.

276     Chapter 11: Routing Protocol Selection Criteria
If a routing protocol uses only bandwidth as the metric and there are several different speeds in the 
path, it can use the lowest speed in the path to determine the bandwidth for the path. EIGRP and 
IGRP use the minimum path bandwidth, inverted and scaled, as one part of the metric calculation. 
In Figure 11-4, Path 1 has two segments, each with 256 kbps and 512 kbps of bandwidth. Because 
the smaller speed is 256 kbps, this speed is used as Path 1’s bandwidth. The smallest bandwidth in 
Path 2 is 384 kbps. When the router has to choose between Path 1 and Path 2, it selects Path 2 
because 384 kbps beats 256 kbps.
Figure 11-4
Bandwidth Metric Example
Cost
Cost is the name of the metric used by OSPF and IS-IS. In OSPF on a Cisco router, the default cost 
of a link is derived from the bandwidth of the interface.
IS-IS assigns a default cost of 10 for all interfaces.
The formula to calculate cost in OSPF is 
108/BW
where BW is the default or conﬁgured bandwidth of the interface.
For Ethernet, cost is calculated as follows:
BW = 10 Mbps = 10 x 106 = 10,000,000 = 107
Cost (Ethernet) = 108 / 107 = 10
The sum of all the costs to reach a destination is the metric for that route. The lowest cost is the 
preferred path.
Figure 11-5 shows an example of how the path costs are calculated. The path cost is the sum of all costs 
in the path. The cost for Path 1 is 350 + 180 = 530. The cost for Path 2 is 15 + 50 + 100 + 50 = 215.

Routing Protocol Metrics and Loop Prevention     277
Because the cost of Path 2 is less than that for Path 1, Path 2 is selected as the best route to the 
destination.
Figure 11-5
Cost Metric Example
Load
The load parameter refers to the degree to which the interface link is busy. The router keeps track of 
interface utilization; routing protocols can use this metric in the calculation of a best route. Load is 
one of the ﬁve parameters included in the deﬁnition of the IGRP and EIGRP metric. By default, it 
is not used in the calculation of the composite metric. If you have 512 kbps and 256 kbps links to 
reach a destination, but the 512 Kbps circuit is 99 percent busy and the 256 kbps is only 5 percent 
busy, the 256 kbps link would be the preferred path. On Cisco routers, the percentage of load is 
shown as a fraction over 255. Utilization at 100 percent is shown as 255/255 and utilization at 0 
percent is shown as 0/255. Example 11-1 shows the load of a serial interface at 5/255 (1.9 percent). 
Delay
The delay parameter refers to the length in time to move a packet to the destination. Delay depends 
on many factors, such as link bandwidth, utilization, port queues, and physical distance traveled. 
Total delay is one of the ﬁve parameters included in the deﬁnition of the IGRP and EIGRP compos-
ite metric. By default, it is used in the calculation of the composite metric. You can conﬁgure the 
delay of an interface with the delay tens-of-microseconds command, where tens-of-microseconds

speciﬁes the delay in tens of microseconds for an interface or network segment. As shown in 
Example 11-2, the delay of the interface is 20,000 microseconds.
Reliability
The reliability parameter is the dependability of a network link. Some WAN links tend to go up and 
down throughout the day. These links get a small reliability rating. Reliability is measured by factors 
such as the expected received keepalives of a link and the number of packet drops and interface 
resets. If the ratio is high, the line is reliable. The best rating is 255/255, which is 100 percent reli-
ability. Reliability is one of the ﬁve parameters included in the deﬁnition of the IGRP and EIGRP 
metric. By default, it is not used in the calculation of the composite metric. As shown in Example 11-3, 
you can verify the reliability of an interface using the show interface command.
Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
The MTU parameter is simply the maximum size of bytes a unit can have on an interface. If the 
outgoing packet is larger than the MTU, the IP protocol might need to fragment it. If a packet 
larger that the MTU has the “do not fragment” ﬂag set, the packet is dropped. As shown in Example 
11-4, you can verify the MTU of an interface using the show interface command.

Routing Protocol Metrics and Loop Prevention     279
Routing Loop-Prevention Schemes
Some routing protocols employ schemes to prevent the creation of routing loops in the network. 
These schemes are
I
Split horizon 
I
Split horizon with poison reverse
I
Counting to inﬁnity
Split Horizon
Split horizon is a technique used by distance-vector routing protocols to prevent routing loops. 
Routes that are learned from a neighboring router are not sent back to that neighboring router, thus 
suppressing the route. If the neighbor is already closer to the destination, it already has a better path.
In Figure 11-6, Routers 1, 2, and 3 learn about Networks A, B, C, and D. Router 2 learns about A 
from Router 1 and has Networks B and C in its routing table also. Router 3 advertises Network D 
to Router 2. Now, Router 2 knows about all networks. Router 2 will send its routing table to Router 
3 without the route for Network D because it learned that route from Router 3.
Figure 11-6
Simple Split-Horizon Example
Split Horizon with Poison Reverse
Split horizon with poison reverse is a route update sent out an interface with an inﬁnite metric for 
routes learned (received) from the same interface. Poison reverse simply indicates that the learned 
route is unreachable. It is more reliable that split horizon alone. Examine Figure 11-7. Instead of 
suppressing the route for Network D, Router 2 will send that route in the routing table marked as 
unreachable. In RIP, the poison-reverse route is marked with a metric of 16 (inﬁnite) to prevent that 
path from being used. 
Network A
Network B
Network C
Network D
Router 1
Router 2
Router 3
With Split Horizon, Router 2 sends Net A
and Net B routes to Router 3; no route for
Net D is sent to Router 3.
Net A = metric
Net B = metric

280     Chapter 11: Routing Protocol Selection Criteria
Figure 11-7
Split Horizon with Poison Reverse
Counting to Inﬁnity
Some routing protocols keep track of router hops as the packet travels through the network. In large 
networks where a routing loop might not be present because of a network outage, routers might 
forward a packet without it reaching its destination.
Counting to inﬁnity is a loop prevention technique where the router discards a packet when it 
reaches a maximum limit. It assumes that the network diameter is smaller than the maximum 
allowed hops. The router uses the Time-To-Live (TTL) ﬁeld for counting to inﬁnity. The TTL starts 
at a set number and is decremented at each router hop. When the TTL equals 0, the packet is 
discarded. For IGRP and EIGRP, the TTL of routing updates are 100 by default.
Triggered Updates
Another loop-prevention and fast-convergence technique used by routing protocols is triggered 
updates. When a router interface changes state (up or down), the router is required to send an update 
message, even if it is not time for the periodic update message. Immediate notiﬁcation about a 
network outage is key to maintaining valid routing entries within all routers in the network. Some 
distance-vector protocols, including RIP, specify a small time delay to avoid having triggered 
updates generate excessive network trafﬁc. The time delay is variable for each router.
Summarization
Another characteristic of routing protocols is the ability to summarize routes. Protocols that support 
CIDR have the ability to perform summarization outside of IP class boundaries. By summarizing, 
the routing protocol can reduce the size of the routing table, and there are fewer routing updates on 
the network.
Network A
Network B
Network C
Network D
Router 1
Router 2
Router 3
With Poison Reverse, Router 2 sends Net A
and Net B routes to Router 3; also, a
route for Net D with an infinite metric.
Net A = metric
Net B = metric
Net D = unreachable

ODR     281
ODR
ODR is a mechanism for reducing the overhead with routing. Only Cisco routers can use ODR. With 
ODR, there is no need to conﬁgure dynamic routing protocols or static routes at a stub router. ODR 
eliminates the need to manage static route conﬁguration at the hub router.
Figure 11-8 shows a hub-and-spoke network where you can conﬁgure ODR. The stub router is the 
spoke router in the hub-and-spoke network. The stub network consists of small LAN segments 
connected to the stub router and a WAN connection to the hub. Because all outgoing trafﬁc travels 
via the WAN, no external routing information is necessary.
Figure 11-8
ODR Hub-and-Spoke Network
ODR simpliﬁes the conﬁguration of IP with stub networks in which the hub routers dynamically 
maintain routes to the stub networks. With ODR, the stub router advertises the IP preﬁxes of its 
connected networks to the hub router. It does so without requiring the conﬁguration of an IP routing 
protocol at the stub routers.
ODR uses the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) for communication between hub and stub routers. 
CDP must be enabled for ODR to work. CDP updates every 60 seconds. Because ODR route 
preﬁxes are carried in CDP messages, a change is not reported until the CDP message is sent.
The hub router receives the preﬁx routes from its stub routers. You can conﬁgure the hub router to 
redistribute these preﬁxes into a dynamic routing protocol to propagate those routes to the rest of 
the internetwork.

292     Chapter 12: RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design
Foundation Topics
“Foundation Topics” covers the characteristics of the distance-vector routing protocols that the 
CCDA might choose from in a network design. RIPv1 is a routing protocol developed in the late 
1980s; it was the only interior gateway protocol (IGP) at that time. RIPv2 provides enhancements 
to RIP, such as support for VLSMs.
The IGRP is an IGP developed by Cisco in the early 1990s that was not limited to the 15 router-hop 
constraint in RIP. EIGRP is a hybrid routing protocol that uses distance-vector metrics and link-state 
routing protocol characteristics.
RIPv1
RFC 1058 from June 1988 deﬁnes RIPv1. RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses router 
hop count as the metric. RIP is a classful routing protocol that does not support VLSMs or CIDR. 
There is no method for authenticating route updates. A RIP router sends a copy of its routing table 
to its neighbors every 30 seconds. RIP uses split horizon with poison reverse; therefore, route 
updates are sent out an interface with an inﬁnite metric for routes learned (received) from the same 
interface. 
The RIP standard was based on the popular routed program used in UNIX systems since the 1980s. 
The Cisco implementation of RIP adds support for load balancing. RIP will load-balance trafﬁc if 
there are several paths with the same metric (equal-cost load balancing) to a destination. Also, RIP 
sends triggered updates when the metric of a route changes. Triggered updates can help the network 
converge faster rather than wait for the periodic update. RIP has an administrative distance of 120. 
Chapter 11, “Routing Protocol Selection Criteria,” covers administrative distance.
RIP summarizes to IP network values at network boundaries. A network boundary occurs at a router 
that has one or more interfaces that do not participate in the speciﬁed IP network. The IP address 
assigned to the interface determines participation. IP class determines the network value. For 
example, an IP network that uses 24-bit subnetworks from 180.100.50.0/24 to 180.100.120.0/24 
is summarized to 180.100.0.0/16 at a network boundary. 
RIPv1 Forwarding Information Base
The RIPv1 protocol keeps the following information about each destination:
I
IP address—IP address of the destination host or network
I
Gateway—The ﬁrst gateway along the path to the destination

RIPv1     293
I
Interface—The physical network that must be used to reach the destination
I
Metric—A number indicating the number of hops to the destination
I
Timer—The amount of time since the entry was last updated
The database is updated with the route updates received from neighboring routers. As shown in 
Example 12-1, the show ip rip database command shows the RIP private database of a router.
RIPv1 Message Format
As described in RFC 1058, the RIPv1 message format appears in Figure 12-1. The RIP messages 
are encapsulated using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). RIP uses the well-known UDP port 520.

294     Chapter 12: RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design
The following is a description of each ﬁeld:
I
Command—Describes the purpose of the packet. The RFC describes ﬁve commands, two of 
which are obsolete and one of which is reserved. The two used commands are
— request—Requests all or part of the responding router's routing table.
— response—Contains all or part of the sender's routing table. This message might be a 
response to a request, or it might be an update message generated by the sender.
I
Version—Set to the value of 1 for RIPv1.
I
Address Family Identiﬁer (AFI)—Set to a value of 2 for IP. 
I
IP address—The destination route. It might be a network address, subnet, or host route. Special 
route 0.0.0.0 is used for the default route.
I
Metric—A ﬁeld that is 32 bits in length. It contains a value between 1 and 15 inclusive, 
specifying the current metric for the destination. The metric is set to 16 to indicate that a 
destination is not reachable.
Because RIP has a maximum hop count, it implements counting to inﬁnity. For RIP, inﬁnity is 
16 hops. Notice in the RIP message that there are no subnet masks accompanying each route. Five 
32-bit words are repeated for each route entry: AFI (16 bits); unused, which is 0 (16 bits); IP address; 
two more 32-bit unused ﬁelds; and the 32-bit metric. Five 32-bit words equals 20 bytes for each 
route entry. Up to 25 routes are allowed in each RIP message. The maximum datagram size is 
limited to 512 bytes, not including the IP header. Calculating 25 routes by 20 bytes each, plus 
the RIP header (4 bytes), plus an 8-byte UDP header, you get 512 bytes.
RIPv1 Timers
The Cisco implementation of RIP uses four timers: 
I
Update
I
Invalid
I
Flush
I
Holddown
RIP sends its full routing table out all conﬁgured interfaces. The table is sent periodically as a 
broadcast (255.255.255.255) to all hosts.

RIPv1     295
Update Timer
The update timer speciﬁes the frequency of the periodic broadcasts. By default, the update timer is 
set to 30 seconds. Each route has a timeout value associated with it. The timeout gets reset every 
time the router receives a routing update containing the route.
Invalid Timer
When the timeout value expires, the route is marked as unreachable because it is marked invalid. 
The router marks the route invalid by setting the metric to 16. The route is retained in the routing 
table. By default, the invalid timer is 180 seconds, or six updates periods (30 x 6 = 180).
Flush Timer
A route entry marked as invalid is retained in the routing table until the ﬂush timer expires. By 
default, the ﬂush timer is 240 seconds, which is 60 seconds longer than the invalid timer.
Holddown Timer
Cisco implements an additional timer for RIP, the holddown timer. The holddown timer stabilizes 
routes by setting an allowed time for which routing information regarding different paths is sup-
pressed. After the metric for a route entry changes, the router accepts no updates for the route until 
the holddown timer expires. By default, the holddown timer is 180 seconds.
The output of the show ip protocol command, as shown in Example 12-2, shows the timers for RIP, 
unchanged from the defaults.

RIPv1 Design
Things to remember in designing a network with RIPv1 include that it does not support VLSM and 
CIDR. The IP addressing scheme with RIPv1 requires the same subnet mask for the entire IP net-
work, a ﬂat IP network. RIPv1 is limited to 15 hops; therefore, the network diameter cannot exceed 
this limit. RIPv1 also broadcasts its routing table every 30 seconds. RIPv1 is usually limited to 
accessing networks where it can interoperate with servers running routed or with non-Cisco routers. 
RIP also appears at the edge of larger networks.
As shown in Figure 12-2, when you use RIPv1, all segments must have the same subnet mask.

RIPv2     297
RIPv2
RIPv2 was ﬁrst described in RFC 1388 and RFC 1723 (1994); the current RFC is 2453, written in 
November 1998. Although current environments use advanced routing protocols such as OSPF and 
EIGRP, there still are networks using RIP. The need to use VLSMs and other requirements prompted 
the deﬁnition of RIPv2.
RIPv2 improves upon RIPv1 with the ability to use VLSM, with support for route authentication, 
and with multicasting of route updates. RIPv2 supports CIDR. It still sends updates every 30 sec-
onds and retains the 15-hop limit; it also uses triggered updates. RIPv2 still uses UDP port 520; the 
RIP process is responsible for checking the version number. It retains the loop-prevention strategies 
of poison reverse and counting to inﬁnity. On Cisco routers, RIPv2 has the same administrative dis-
tance as RIPv1, which is 120. Finally, RIPv2 uses the IP address 224.0.0.9 when multicasting route 
updates to other RIP routers. As in RIPv1, RIPv2 will, by default, summarize IP networks at net-
work boundaries. You can disable autosummarization if required.
You can use RIPv2 in small networks where VLSM is required. It also works at the edge of larger 
networks. 
Authentication
Authentication can prevent communication with any RIP routers that are not intended to be part of 
the network, such as UNIX stations running routed. Only RIP updates with the authentication 
password are  accepted. RFC 1723 deﬁnes simple plain-text authentication for RIPv2.
MD5 Authentication
In addition to plain-text passwords, the Cisco implementation provides the ability to use Message 
Digest 5 (MD5) authentication, which is deﬁned in RFC 1321. Its algorithm takes as input a 
message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit ﬁngerprint or message digest of 
the input, making it much more secure than plain-text passwords.
RIPv2 Forwarding Information Base
RIPv2 maintains a routing table database as in Version 1. The difference is that it also keeps the 
subnet mask information. The following list repeats the table information of RIPv1:
I
IP address—IP address of the destination host or network, with subnet mask
I
Gateway—The ﬁrst gateway along the path to the destination
I
Interface—The physical network that must be used to reach the destination
I
Metric—A number indicating the number of hops to the destination
I
Timer—The amount of time since the route entry was last updated

298     Chapter 12: RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design
RIPv2 Message Format
The RIPv2 message format takes advantage of the unused ﬁelds in the RIPv1 message format by 
adding subnet masks and other information. Figure 12-3 shows the RIPv2 message format.
Figure 12-3
RIPv2 Message Format
The following is a description of each ﬁeld:
I
Command—Indicates whether the packet is a request or a response message. The request 
message asks that a router send all or a part of its routing table. Response messages contain 
route entries. The router sends the response periodically or as a reply to a request. 
I
Version—Speciﬁes the RIP version used. It is set to 2 for RIPv2 and set to 1 for RIPv1.
I
AFI—Speciﬁes the address family used. RIP is designed to carry routing information for 
several different protocols. Each entry has an AFI to indicate the type of address speciﬁed. The 
AFI for IP is 2. The AFI is set to 0xFFF for the ﬁrst entry to indicate that the remainder of the 
entry contains authentication information. 
I
Route tag—Provides a method for distinguishing between internal routes (learned by RIP) and 
external routes (learned from other protocols). You can add this optional attribute during the 
redistribution of routing protocols.
I
IP address—Speciﬁes the IP address (network) of the destination.
I
Subnet mask—Contains the subnet mask for the destination. If this ﬁeld is 0, no subnet mask 
has been speciﬁed for the entry.

destination.
I
Metric—Indicates how many router hops to reach the destination. The metric is between 1 and 
15 for a valid route or 16 for an unreachable or inﬁnite route.
Again, as in Version 1, the router permits up to 25 occurrences of the last ﬁve 32-bit words (20 bytes) 
for up to 25 routes per RIP message. If the AFI speciﬁes an authenticated message, the router can 
specify only 24 routing-table entries. The updates are sent to the multicast address of 224.0.0.9.
RIPv2 Timers
RIPv2 timers are the same as in Version 1. They send periodic updates every 30 seconds. The default 
invalid timer is 180 seconds, the holddown timer is 180 seconds, and the ﬂush timer is 240 seconds. 
You can write this list as 30/180/180/240 representing the U/I/H/F timers.
RIPv2 Design
Things to remember in designing a network with RIPv2 include that it supports VLSM within 
networks and CIDR for network summarization across adjacent networks. RIPv2 allows for the 
summarization of routes in a hierarchical network. RIPv2 is still limited to 16 hops; therefore, the 
network diameter cannot exceed this limit. RIPv2 multicasts its routing table every 30 seconds 
to the multicast IP address 224.0.0.9. RIPv2 is usually limited to accessing networks where it can 
interoperate with servers running routed or with non-Cisco routers. RIPv2 also appears at the edge 
of larger internetworks. RIPv2 further provides for route authentication.
As shown in Figure 12-4, when you use RIPv2, all segments can have different subnet masks.

IGRP
Cisco Systems developed the IGRP to overcome the limitations of RIPv1. IGRP is a distance-vector 
routing protocol that considers a composite metric which, by default, uses bandwidth and delay as 
parameters instead of hop count. IGRP is not limited to the 15-hop limit of RIP. IGRP has a maxi-
mum hop limit of 100, by default, and can be conﬁgured to support a network diameter of 255.
With IGRP, routers usually select paths with a larger minimum-link bandwidth over paths with a 
smaller hop count. Links do not have a hop count. They are exactly one hop.
IGRP is a classful protocol and cannot implement VLSM or CIDR. IGRP summarizes at network 
boundaries. As in RIP, IGRP implements split horizon with poison reverse, triggered updates, and 
holddown timers for stability and loop prevention. Another beneﬁt of IGRP is that it can load-
balance over unequal-cost links. As a routing protocol developed by Cisco, IGRP is available only 
on Cisco routers.
By default, IGRP will load-balance trafﬁc if there are several paths with equal cost to the destina-
tion. IGRP will do unequal-cost load balancing if conﬁgured with the variance command.     
IGRP Timers
IGRP sends its routing table to its neighbors every 90 seconds. IGRP's default update period of 
90 seconds is a beneﬁt compared to RIP, which can consume excessive bandwidth when sending 
updates every 30 seconds. IGRP uses an invalid timer to mark a route as invalid after 270 seconds 
(three times the update timer). As with RIP, IGRP uses a ﬂush timer to remove a route from the 
routing table; the default ﬂush timer is set to 630 seconds (seven times the update period and more 
than 10 minutes).

IGRP     301
If a network goes down or the metric for the network increases, the route is placed in holddown. The 
router accepts no new changes for the route until the holddown timer expires. This setup prevents 
routing loops in the network. The default holddown timer is 280 seconds (three times the update 
timer plus 10 seconds). Table 12-2 summarizes the default settings for IGRP timers.
IGRP Metrics
IGRP uses a composite metric based on bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability. Chapter 11 discussed 
these metrics. By default, IGRP uses bandwidth and delay to calculate the composite metric, as 
follows:
IGRPmetric = {k1 x BW + [(k2 x BW)/(256 – load)] + k3 x delay} x {k5/(reliability + k4)}
In this formula, BW uses the lowest interface bandwidth in the path, and delay is the sum of all 
outbound interface delays in the path. The router dynamically measures reliability and load. The 
values of reliability and load used in the metric computation range from 1 to 255. Cisco IOS routers 
display a 100 percent reliability as 255/255. They also display load as a fraction of 255. They display 
an interface with no load as 1/255. By default, k1 and k3 are set to 1, and k2, k4, and k5 are set to 
0. With the default values, the metric becomes
IGRPmetric = {1 x BW + [(0 x BW)/(256 – load)] + 1 x delay} x {0/(reliability + 0)}
IGRPmetric = BW + delay
The BW is 10,000,000 divided by the smallest of all the bandwidths (in kbps) from outgoing inter-
faces to the destination. To ﬁnd delay, add all the delays (in microseconds) from the outgoing 
interfaces to the destination and divide this number by 10. (The delay is in 10s of microseconds.)
Example 12-3 shows the output interfaces of two routers. For a source host to reach network 
172.16.2.0, a path takes the serial link and then the Ethernet interface. The bandwidths are 10,000 
and 1544; the slowest bandwidth is 1544. The sum of delays is 20000 + 1000 = 21000.

The IGRP metric is calculated as follows:
IGRPmetric = (10,000,000/1544) + (20000 + 1000)/10
IGRPmetric = 6476 + 2100 = 8576
You can change the default metrics using the metric weight tos k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 subcommand under 
router igrp. Cisco once intended to implement the tos ﬁeld as a specialized service in IGRP; it was 
not implemented so the value of tos is always 0. The k arguments are the k values used to build the 
composite metric. For example, if you want to use all metrics, the command is as follows:
router igrp n
 metric weight 0 1 1 1 1 1
IGRP Design
Something to remember when designing a network with IGRP is that it does not support VLSMs. 
The IP addressing scheme with IGRP requires the same subnet mask for the entire IP network, a ﬂat 
IP network. IGRP does not support CIDR and network summarization within the major network 
boundary. IGRP is not limited to a maximum of 15 hops as RIP is; therefore, the network diameter 
can be larger than that of networks using RIP. IGRP also broadcasts its routing table every 90 
seconds, which produces less network overhead than RIP. IGRP is limited to Cisco-only networks. 
EIGRP is recommended over IGRP.
As shown in Figure 12-5, when you use IGRP, all segments must have the same subnet mask.

EIGRP
Cisco Systems released EIGRP in the early 1990s as an evolution of IGRP toward a more scalable 
routing protocol for large internetworks. EIGRP is a classless protocol that permits the use of 
VLSMs and that supports CIDR for the scalable allocation of IP addresses. EIGRP does not send 
Router A
Router B
172.16.1.0/24
172.16.2.0/24
172.16.3.0/24

304     Chapter 12: RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design
routing updates periodically, as does IGRP. EIGRP allows for authentication with simple passwords 
or with MD5. EIGRP autosummarizes networks at network borders and can load-balance over 
unequal–cost paths. Packets using EIGRP use IP protocol 88. Only Cisco routers can use EIGRP.
EIGRP is an advanced distance-vector protocol that implements some characteristics similar to 
those of link-state protocols. Some Cisco documentation refers to EIGRP as a hybrid protocol. 
EIGRP advertises its routing table to its neighbors as distance-vector protocols do, but it uses hellos 
and forms neighbor relationships as link-state protocols do. EIGRP sends partial updates when a 
metric or the topology changes on the network. It does not send full routing-table updates in periodic 
fashion as do distance-vector protocols. EIGRP uses DUAL to determine loop-free paths to desti-
nations. This section discusses DUAL.
By default, EIGRP load-balances trafﬁc if there are several paths with equal cost to the destination. 
EIGRP performs unequal-cost load balancing if you conﬁgure it with the variance <n> command. 
EIGRP includes routes that are equal to or less that n times the minimum metric route to a destina-
tion. As in RIP and IGRP, EIGRP also summarizes IP networks at network boundaries.
EIGRP internal routes have an administrative distance of 90. EIGRP summary routes have an 
administrative distance of 5, and EIGRP external routes (from redistribution) have an administrative 
distance of 170. 
EIGRP Components
EIGRP has four components that characterize it:
I
Protocol-dependent modules
I
Neighbor discovery and recovery
I
Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP)
I
DUAL
Know the role of the EIGRP components, which are described in the following sections.
 Protocol-Dependent Modules
EIGRP uses different modules that independently support IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), 
and AppleTalk routed protocols. These modules are the logical interface between DUAL and routing 
protocols such as IPX RIP, AppleTalk Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), and IGRP. The 
EIGRP module sends and receives packets but passes received information to DUAL, which makes 
routing decisions.

EIGRP     305
EIGRP automatically redistributes with IGRP if you conﬁgure both protocols with the same auton-
omous system number. When conﬁgured to support IPX, EIGRP communicates with the IPX RIP 
and forwards the route information to DUAL to select the best paths. AppleTalk EIGRP automati-
cally redistributes routes with AppleTalk RTMP to support AppleTalk networks. AppleTalk is not a 
CCDA objective and is not covered in this book. 
 Neighbor Discovery and Recovery
EIGRP discovers and maintains information about its neighbors. It multicasts hello packets 
(224.0.0.10) every 5 seconds for most networks. The router builds a table with EIGRP neighbor 
information. The holdtime to maintain a neighbor is three times the hello time: 15 seconds. If 
the router does not receive a hello in 15 seconds, it removes the neighbor from the table. EIGRP 
multicasts hellos every 60 seconds on multipoint WAN interfaces (X.25, Frame Relay, ATM) with 
speeds less than 1544 Mbps, inclusive. The neighbor holdtime is 180 seconds on these types of 
interfaces. To summarize, hello/holdtime timers are 5/15 seconds for high-speed links and 60/180 
seconds for low-speed links.
Example 12-4 shows an EIGRP neighbor database. The table lists the neighbor's IP address, the 
interface to reach it, the neighbor holdtime timer, and the uptime.
RTP
EIGRP uses RTP to manage EIGRP packets. RTP ensures the reliable delivery of route updates and 
also uses sequence numbers to ensure ordered delivery. It sends update packets using multicast 
address 224.0.0.10. It acknowledges updates using unicast hello packets with no data.
DUAL
EIGRP implements DUAL to select paths and guarantee freedom from routing loops. J.J. Garcia 
Luna-Aceves developed DUAL, which is mathematically proven to result in a loop-free topology, 
providing no need for periodic updates or route-holddown mechanisms that make convergence 
slower.

306     Chapter 12: RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design
DUAL selects a best path and a second best path to reach a destination. The best path selected 
by DUAL is the successor, and the second best path (if available) is the feasible successor. The 
feasible distance is the lowest calculated metric of a path to reach the destination. The topology table 
in Example 12-5 shows the feasible distance. The example also shows two paths (Ethernet 0 and 
Ethernet 1) to reach 172.16.4.0/30. Because the paths have different metrics, DUAL chooses only 
one successor.
The route entries in Example 12-5 are marked P as in the “passive” state. A destination is in passive 
state when the router is not performing any recomputations for the entry. If the successor goes down 
and the route entry has feasible successors, the router does not need to perform any recomputations 
and does not go into active state.
DUAL places the route entry for a destination into active state if the successor goes down and there 
are no feasible successors. EIGRP routers send query packets to neighboring routers to ﬁnd a 
feasible successor to the destination. A neighboring router can send a reply packet that indicates it 
has a feasible successor or a query packet. The query packet indicates that the neighboring router 
does not have a feasible successor and will participate in the recomputation. A route does not return 
to passive state until it has received a reply packet from each neighboring router. If the router does 
not receive all the replies before the “active-time” timer expires, DUAL declares the route as stuck-
in-active (SIA). The default active timer is 3 minutes.
EIGRP Timers
EIGRP sets updates only when necessary and sends them only to neighboring routers. There is no 
periodic update timer. 
EIGRP uses hello packets to learn of neighboring routers. On high-speed networks, the default hello 
packet interval is 5 seconds. On multipoint networks with link speeds of T1 and slower, hello 
packets are unicast every 60 seconds.
Example 12-5

EIGRP     307
The holdtime to maintain a neighbor adjacency is three times the hello time: 15 seconds. If a router 
does not receive a hello within the holdtime, it removes the neighbor from the table. Hellos are 
multicast every 60 seconds on multipoint WAN interfaces (X.25, Frame Relay, ATM) with speeds 
less than 1544 Mbps, inclusive. The neighbor holdtime is 180 seconds on these types of interfaces. 
To summarize, hello/holdtime timers are 5/15 seconds for high-speed links and 60/180 seconds for 
multipoint WAN links less than 1544 Mbps, inclusive.
EIGRP Metrics
EIGRP uses the same composite metric as IGRP, but the BW term is multiplied by 256 for ﬁner 
granularity. The composite metric is based on bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability. MTU is not an 
attribute for calculating the composite metric.
EIGRP calculates the composite metric with the following formula:
EIGRPmetric = {k1 x BW + [(k2 x BW)/(256 – load)] + k3 x delay} x {k5/(reliability + k4)}
In this formula, BW is the lowest interface bandwidth in the path, and delay is the sum of all 
outbound interface delays in the path. The router dynamically measures reliability and load. It 
expresses a 100 percent reliability as 255/255. It expresses load as a fraction of 255. An interface 
with no load is represented as 1/255.
Bandwidth is the inverse minimum bandwidth (in kbps) of the path in bits per second scaled by a 
factor of 256 x 107. The formula for bandwidth is 
(256 x 107)/BWmin
The delay is the sum of the outgoing interface delays (in microseconds) to the destination. A delay 
of all 1s (that is, a delay of hexadecimal FFFFFFFF) indicates that the network is unreachable. The 
formula for delay is 
[sum of delays] x 256
Reliability is a value between 1 and 255. Cisco IOS routers display reliability as a fraction of 255. 
That is, 255/255 is 100 percent reliability or a perfectly stable link; a value of 229/255 represents a 
90 percent reliable link.
Load is a value between 1 and 255. A load of 255/255 indicates a completely saturated link. A load 
of 127/255 represents a 50 percent saturated link.
NOTE
EIGRP does not send updates using a broadcast address; instead, it sends them to the 
multicast address 224.0.0.10 (all EIGRP routers).

308     Chapter 12: RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design
By default, k1=k3=1 and k2=k4=k5=0. The default composite metric, adjusted for scaling factors, 
for EIGRP is
EIGRPmetric = 256 x { [107/BWmin] + [sum_of_delays] }
BWmin is in kbps, and the sum_of_delays is in 10s of microseconds. The bandwidth and delay for 
an Ethernet interface are 10 Mbps and 1 ms, respectively.  
The calculated EIGRP BW metric is
256 x  107/BW
= 256 x  107/10,000
= 256 x 10,000
= 256,000
The calculated EIGRP delay metric is
256 x sum of delay =  256 x 1 ms
= 256 x 100 x 10 microseconds
= 25,600 (in tens of microseconds)
Table 12-3 shows some default values for bandwidth and delay.
As with IGRP, you use the metric weights subcommand to change EIGRP metric computation. You 
can change the k values in the EIGRP composite metric formula to select which EIGRP metrics to

use. The command to change the k values is the metric weights tos k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 subcommand 
under router eigrp n. The tos value is always 0. You set the other arguments to 1 or 0 to alter the 
composite metric. For example, if you want the EIGRP composite metric to use all the parameters, 
the command is as follows:
router eigrp n
 metric weights 0 1 1 1 1 1
EIGRP Packet Types
EIGRP uses ﬁve packet types:
I
Hello—EIGRP uses hello packets in the discovery of neighbors. They are multicast to 
224.0.0.10. By default, EIGRP sends hello packets every 5 seconds (60 seconds on WAN links 
with 1544 Mbps speeds or less).
I
Acknowledgment—An acknowledgment packet acknowledges the reception of an update 
packet. It is a hello packet with no data. EIGRP sends acknowledgment packets to the unicast 
address of the sender of the update packet.
I
Update—Update packets contain routing information for destinations. EIGRP unicasts update 
packets to newly discovered neighbors; otherwise, it multicasts update packets to 224.0.0.10 
when a link or metric changes. Update packets are acknowledged to ensure reliable 
transmission. 
I
Query—EIGRP sends query packets to ﬁnd feasible successors to a destination. Query packets 
are always multicast.
I
Reply—EIGRP sends reply packets to respond to query packets. Reply packets provide a 
feasible successor to the sender of the query. Reply packets are unicast to the sender of the 
query packet.
EIGRP Design
When designing a network with EIGRP, remember that it supports VLSMs, CIDR, and network 
summarization. EIGRP allows for the summarization of routes in a hierarchical network. EIGRP is 
not limited to 16 hops as RIP is; therefore, the network diameter can exceed this limit. EIGRP does 
not broadcasts its routing table periodically so there is no large network overhead. You can use 
EIGRP for large networks; it is a potential routing protocol for the core of a large network. EIGRP 
further provides for route authentication.
As shown in Figure 12-6, when you use EIGRP, all segments can have different subnet masks.

OSPF and IS-IS
This chapter reviews the characteristics and design issues of the Open Shortest Path First 
(OSPF) and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocols. Both OSPF and 
IS-IS are link-state routing protocols. They do not broadcast their route tables as distance-vector 
routing protocols do. Routers using link-state routing protocols send information about the 
status of their interfaces to all other routers in the area. Then, they perform database 
computations to determine the shortest paths to destinations.

OSPF     325
Foundation Topics
This chapter covers the link-state routing protocols OSPF and IS-IS. These two routing protocols 
are Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) used within an autonomous system. OSPF is a popular 
standards-based protocol used in enterprises. IS-IS is commonly used by large Internet service 
providers (ISPs) in their internal networks.
For the CCDA test, understand the characteristics and design constraints of these routing protocols. 
You should know the differences between OSPF, IS-IS, and the distance-vector routing protocols 
covered in Chapter 12, “RIP, IGRP, and EIGRP Characteristics and Design.” 
OSPF
RFC 2328 deﬁnes OSPF, a link-state routing protocol that uses Dijkstra’s shortest-path ﬁrst (SPF) 
algorithm to calculate paths to destinations. In OSPF, each router sends link-state advertisements 
about itself and its links to all other routers in the area. Note that it does not send routing tables but 
link-state information about its interfaces. Then, each router individually calculates the best routes 
to the destination by running the SPF algorithm. Each OSPF router in an area maintains an identical 
database describing the area’s topology. The routing table at each router is individually constructed 
using the local copy of this database to construct a shortest-path tree.
OSPF is a classless routing protocol that permits the use of VLSMs and classless interdomain 
routing (CIDR). With Cisco routers, OSPF also supports equal-cost multipath load balancing and 
neighbor authentication. OSPF uses multicast addresses to communicate between routers. OSPF 
uses IP protocol 89. 
OSPF Concepts and Design
This section covers OSPF theory and design concepts. It discusses OSPF LSAs, area types, and 
router types. OSPF uses a two-layer hierarchy with a backbone area at the top and all other areas 
below. Routers send LSAs informing other routers on the status of their interfaces. The use of LSAs 
and the limitation of OSPF areas are important concepts to understand for the test. 
OSPF Metric
The metric OSPF uses is cost. It is an unsigned 16-bit integer in the range of 1 to 65,535. The default 
cost for interfaces is calculated based on the bandwidth in the formula 108/BW, with BW being the 
bandwidth of the interface expressed as a full integer of bps. If the result is smaller than 1, the cost is 
set to 1. A 10BASE-T (10 Mbps = 107 bps) interface has a cost of 108/107 = 10. OSPF performs a 
summation of the costs to reach a destination; the lowest cost is the preferred path. Table 13-2 shows 
some sample interface metrics.

326     Chapter 13: OSPF and IS-IS
The default reference bandwidth used to calculate OSPF costs is 108 (cost = 108/BW). Notice that 
for technologies that support speeds greater than 100 Mbps, the default metric gets set to 1 without 
regard for the different capabilities (speed) of the network. 
Cisco provides a method to modify the default reference bandwidth. The cost metric can be 
modiﬁed on every interface.
OSPF Adjacencies and Hello Timers
OSPF uses Hello packets for neighbor discovery. The default Hello interval is 10 seconds 
(30 seconds for nonbroadcast multiple-access (NBMA) networks). Hellos are multicast to 
224.0.0.5 (ALLSPFRouters). Hello packets include such information as the router ID, area ID, 
authentication, and router priority.
After two routers exchange Hello packets and set two-way communication, they establish 
adjacencies.
Figure 13-1 shows a point-to-point network and an NBMA network.
For point-to-point networks, valid neighbors always become adjacent and communicate using mul-
ticast address 224.0.0.5. For broadcast (Ethernet) and NBMA networks (Frame Relay), all routers 
become adjacent to the DR and BDR but not to each other. The section “DRs,” later in this chapter, 
covers the DR concept.

OSPF Networks
On OSPF point-to-multipoint nonbroadcast networks, it might be necessary to conﬁgure the set of 
neighbors that are directly reachable over the point-to-multipoint network. Each neighbor is identi-
ﬁed by its IP address on the point-to-multipoint network. Point-to-multipoint networks do not elect 
DRs, so the DR eligibility of conﬁgured neighbors is undeﬁned. Communication is similar to point-
to-point networks using multicast address 224.0.0.5.
OSPF virtual links unicast OSPF packets. Later in this chapter, the section “Virtual Links” discusses 
virtual links.
OSPF Areas
As a network grows, the initial ﬂooding and database maintenance of LSAs can burden the CPU of 
a router. OSPF uses areas to reduce these effects. An area is a logical grouping of routers and links 
that divides the network. Routers share link-state information with only those routers in their areas. 
This setup reduces the size of the database and the cost of computing the SPF tree at each router.
Each area is assigned a 32-bit integer number. Area 0 (or 0.0.0.0) is reserved for the backbone area. 
Every OSPF network must have a backbone area. The backbone area is responsible for distributing 
routing information between areas. It must exist in any internetwork using OSPF over multiple areas 
as a routing protocol. As you can see in Figure 13-2, communication between Area 1 and Area 2 
must ﬂow through Area 0. This communication can be internal to a single router that has interfaces 
directly connected to Areas 0, 1, and 2.

The following list explains each router type in Figure 13-3:
I
Internal router—Any router whose interfaces all belong to the same OSPF area. These routers 
keep only one link-state database.
I
ABR—Routers that are connected to more than one area. These routers maintain a link-state 
database for each area they belong to. These routers generate summary LSAs.
I
ASBR—Routers that inject external LSAs into the OSPF database (redistribution). These 
external routes are learned via either other routing protocols or static routes. 
I
Backbone router—Routers with at least one interface attached to Area 0.
DRs
On multiaccess networks (such as Ethernet or multipoint Frame Relay), some routers get selected 
as DRs. The purpose of the DR is to collect all LSAs for the multiaccess network and to forward the 
LSA to all non-DR routers; this arrangement reduces the amount of LSA trafﬁc generated. A router 
can be the DR for one multiaccess network and not the DR in another attached multiaccess network.
The DR also ﬂoods the network LSAs to the rest of the area. OSPF also selects a BDR; it takes over 
the function of the DR if the DR fails. Both the DR and BDR become adjacent to all routers in the 
multiaccess network. All routers that are not DR and BDR are sometimes called DRothers. These 
routers are only adjacent to the DR and BDR. OSPF routers multicast LSAs only to adjacent routers. 
DRothers multicast packets to the DR and BDR using the multicast address 224.0.0.6 
(ALLDRouters). The DR ﬂoods updates using ALLSPFRouters (224.0.0.5).
DR and BDR selection is based on an OSPF DR interface priority. The default value is 1, and the 
highest priority determines the DR. In a tie, then OSPF uses the numerically highest router ID. 
The router ID is the IP address of the conﬁgured loopback interface. Routers with a priority of 0 are 
not considered for DR/BDR selection. The dotted lines in Figure 13-4 show the adjacencies in the 
network.
In Figure 13-4, Router A is conﬁgured with a priority of 10, and Router B is conﬁgured with a 
priority of 5. Assuming these routers are turned on simultaneously, Router A becomes the DR for 
the Ethernet network. Router C has a lower priority, becoming adjacent to the Router A and Router 
B but not to Router D. Router D has a priority of 0 and thus is not a candidate to become a DR 
or BDR.
TIP
An OSPF router can be an ABR, ASBR, and a backbone router at the same time. The router 
is an ABR if it has an interface on Area 0 and another interface in another area. The router is a 
backbone router if it has one or more interfaces in Area 0. The router is an ASBR if it redistributes 
external routes into the OSPF network.

330     Chapter 13: OSPF and IS-IS
Figure 13-4
DRs
If you introduce a new router to the network with a higher priority than that of the current DR and 
BDR, it does not become the selected DR unless both the DR and BDR fail. If the DR fails, the 
current BDR becomes the DR.
LSA Types
OSPF routers generate LSAs that are ﬂooded throughout an area or the entire autonomous system. 
OSPF deﬁnes different LSA types for participating routers, DRs, ABRs, and ASBRs. Understanding 
the LSA types can help you with other OSPF concepts. Table 13-3 describes the major LSA types. 
There are other LSA types that are not covered in this book.
Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs are contained within each OSPF area. Routers in different areas pass 
interarea trafﬁc. ABRs exchange Type 2 and Type 3 LSAs. Type 4 and Type 5 LSAs are ﬂooded 
throughout all areas.

AS External Path Types
There are two types of AS external paths, Type 1 (E1) or Type 2 (E2), and they are associated with 
Type 5 LSAs. ASBRs advertise external destinations whose cost can be just a redistribution metric 
(E2) or a redistribution metric plus the costs of each segment (E1) used to reach the ASBR.
By default, external routes are of Type 2, which is the metric (cost) used in the redistribution. Type 
1 external routes have a metric that is the sum of the redistribution cost plus the cost of the path to 
reach the ASBR. 
OSPF Stub Area Types
OSPF provides support for stub areas. The concept is to reduce the number of interarea or external 
LSAs that get ﬂooded into a stub area. RFC 2328 deﬁnes OSPF stub areas. RFC 1587 deﬁnes 
support for NSSAs. Cisco routers use totally stubby areas, as shown in Figure 13-5.
Stub Areas
Consider Area 1 in Figure 13-5. Its only path to the external networks is via the ABR through Area 0. 
All external routes are ﬂooded to all areas in the OSPF AS. You can conﬁgure an area as a stub area 
to prevent OSPF external LSAs (Type 5) from being ﬂooded into that area. A single default route is 
injected into the stub area instead. If multiple ABRs exist in a stub area, all inject the default route. 
Trafﬁc originating within the stub area routes to the closest ABR.
Note that network summary LSAs (Type 3) from other areas are still ﬂooded into the Stub Area 1.

Summary LSA for ASBRs
Originated by ABRs. Sent into an area by the ABR to 
advertise the ASBRs. 
5
AS external LSA
Originated by ASBRs. Advertises destinations external 
to the OSPF AS, ﬂooded throughout the whole 
OSPF AS.
7
Not-so-stubby area (NSSA) 
external LSA
Originated by ASBRs in an NSSA. It is not ﬂooded 
throughout the OSPF autonomous system, only to the 
NSSA. Similar to the Type 5 LSA.

OSPF Stub Networks
Totally Stubby Areas
Take the Area 1 in Figure 13-5 one step further. The only path for Area 1 to get to Area 0 and other 
areas is through the ABR. A totally stubby area does not ﬂood network summary LSAs (Type 3). It 
stiﬂes Type 4 LSAs as well. Like regular stub areas, totally stubby areas do not ﬂood Type 5 LSAs. 
They send just a single LSA for the default route. If multiple ABRs exist in a totally stubby area, 
all ABRs inject the default route. Trafﬁc originating within the totally stubby area routes to the 
closest ABR.
NSSAs
Notice that Area 2 in Figure 13-5 has an ASBR. If this area is conﬁgured as an NSSA, it generates 
the external LSAs (Type 7) into the OSPF system while retaining the characteristics of a stub area 
to the rest of the AS. The ABR for Area 2 can translate the NSSA external LSAs (Type 7) to AS 
external LSAs (Type 5) and ﬂood the rest of the internetwork. If the ABR is not conﬁgured to convert 
the NSSA external LSAs to Type 5 external LSAs, the NSSA external LSAs remain within the NSSA.

OSPF     333
Virtual Links
OSPF requires that all areas be connected to a backbone router. Sometimes, WAN link provisioning 
or failures can prevent an OSPF area from being directly connected to a backbone router. You can 
use virtual links to temporarily connect (virtually) the area to the backbone.
As shown in Figure 13-6, Area 4 is not directly connected to the backbone. A virtual link is conﬁg-
ured between Router A and Router B. The ﬂow of the virtual link is unidirectional and must be con-
ﬁgured in each router of the link. Area 2 becomes the transit area through which the virtual link is 
conﬁgured. Trafﬁc between Areas 2 and 4 does not ﬂow directly to Router B. Instead, the trafﬁc 
must ﬂow to Router A to reach Area 0 and then pass through the virtual link.
Figure 13-6
OSPF Virtual Link
OSPF Router Authentication
OSPF supports the authentication of routes using 64-bit clear text or cryptographic Message Digest 5 
(MD5) authentication. Plain-text authentication passwords do not need to be the same for the routers 
throughout the area, but they must be the same between neighbors.
MD5 authentication provides higher security than plain-text authentication. As with plain-text 
authentication, passwords don’t have to be the same throughout an area, but they do need to be same 
between neighbors.

IS-IS
IS-IS is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) dynamic routing speciﬁcation. IS-IS 
is described in ISO/IEC 10589, reprinted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 1142. 
IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol that ﬂoods link-state information throughout the network to 
build a picture of network topology. IS-IS was primarily intended for routing OSI Connectionless 
Network Protocol (CNLP) packets but has the capability to route IP packets. IP packet routing uses 
Integrated IS-IS, which provides the ability to route protocols such as IP. IS-IS is a common alter-
native to other powerful routing protocols such as OSPF and EIGRP in large networks. Although 
not seen much in enterprise networks, IS-IS is commonly used for internal routing in large ISP 
networks.
IS-IS creates two levels of hierarchy with Level 1 for intra-area and Level 2 for interarea routing. IS-IS 
distinguishes between Level 1 and Level 2 intermediate systems (ISs). Level 1 ISs communicate 
with other Level 1 ISs in the same area. Level 2 ISs route between Level 1 areas and form an 
intradomain routing backbone. Hierarchical routing simpliﬁes backbone design because Level 1 ISs 
only need to know how to get to the nearest Level 2 IS.
IS-IS Metrics
IS-IS as originally deﬁned uses a composite metric with a maximum path value of 1024. The 
required default metric is arbitrary and typically assigned by a network administrator. By conven-
tion, it is intended to measure the capacity of the circuit for handling trafﬁc, such as its throughput 
in bits per second. Higher values indicate a lower capacity. Any single link can have a maximum 
value of 64. IS-IS calculates path values by summing link values. The standard set the maximum 
metric values to provide the granularity to support various link types while at the same time ensuring 
NOTE
In IS-IS, a router is usually the IS and personal computers, workstations, and servers are 
end systems (ESs). End Systems to Intermediate System links are Level 0.

IS-IS     335
that the shortest-path algorithm used for route computation is reasonably efﬁcient. In Cisco routers, 
all interfaces have the default metric of 10. The administrator must conﬁgure the interface metric to 
get a different value. This small metric value range has proved insufﬁcient for large networks and 
provides too little granularity for new features such as trafﬁc engineering and other applications, 
especially with high bandwidth links. Cisco IOS Software addresses this issue with the support of 
a 24-bit metric ﬁeld, the so-called “wide metric.” Wide metrics are also required for route-leaking. 
Using the new metric style, link metrics now have a maximum value of 16,777,215 (224 – 1) with a 
total path metric of 4,261,412,864 (254 x 224 or 232). Deploying IS-IS in the IP network with wide 
metrics is recommended for enabling ﬁner granularity and supporting future applications such as 
trafﬁc engineering.
IS-IS also deﬁnes three optional metrics (costs): delay, expense, and error. Cisco routers do not 
support the three optional metrics. The wide metric noted earlier uses the octets reserved for these 
metrics.
IS-IS Operation and Design
This subsection discusses IS-IS areas, designated routers, authentication, and the NET. IS-IS deﬁnes 
areas differently from OSPF; area boundaries are links and not routers. IS-IS has no BDRs. Because 
IS-IS is an OSI protocol, it uses a NET to identify each router.
NET
To conﬁgure the IS-IS routing protocol, you must conﬁgure a NET on every router. Although 
conﬁguring NET is not a CCDA test requirement, this information is included for “extra credit.”
Although you can conﬁgure IS-IS to route IP, the communication between routers uses OSI PDUs. 
The NET is the OSI address used for each router to communicate with OSI PDUs. A NET address 
ranges from 8 to 20 bytes. It consists of a domain, area ID, system ID, and selector (SEL), as shown 
in Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-7
NET
Level 2 routers use the area ID. The system ID must be the same length for all routers in an area. 
For Cisco routers, it must be 6 bytes in length. Usually, a router MAC address identiﬁes each unique 
router. The SEL is conﬁgured as 00. You conﬁgure the NET with the router isis command. In this

example, the domain authority and format identiﬁer (AFI) is 49, the area is 0001, the system ID is 
00aa.0101.0001, and the SEL is 00:
router isis
 net 49.0001.00aa.0101.0001.00
DRs
As with OSPF, IS-IS selects DRs on multiaccess networks. It does not choose a backup DR as does 
OSPF. By default, the priority value is 64. You can change the priority value to a value from 0 to 127. 
If you set the priority to 0, then the router is not eligible to become a DR for that network. IS-IS uses 
the highest system ID to select the DR if there is a tie with the priorities. On point-to-point networks, 
the priority is 0 because no DR is elected. In IS-IS, all routers in a multiaccess network establish 
adjacencies with all others in the subnetwork, and IS-IS neighbors become adjacent upon the 
discovery of one another. Both these characteristics are different from OSPF behavior.
IS-IS Areas
IS-IS uses a two-level hierarchy similar to the OSPF area hierarchy developed later. Routers are 
conﬁgured to route Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), or both Level 1 and Level 2 (L1/L2). Level 1 routers 
are like OSPF internal routers in a Cisco totally stubby area. An L2 router is similar to an OSPF 
backbone router. A router that has both Level 1 and 2 routes is similar to an OSPF ABR. IS-IS does 
not deﬁne a backbone area, but you can consider the backbone a continuous path of adjacencies 
among Level 2 ISs.
The L1/L2 routers maintain a separate link-state database for the L1 routes and L2 routes. Also, the 
L1/L2 routers do not advertise L2 routes to the L1 area. L1 routers do not have information about 
destinations outside the area and use L1 routes to its L1/L2 router to reach outside destinations. 
As shown in Figure 13-8, IS-IS areas are not bounded by the L1/L2 routers but by the links between 
L1/L2 routers and L2 backbone routers.
IS-IS Authentication
IS-IS supports three types of clear-text authentication: link authentication, area authentication, and 
domain authentication. All these types support only clear-text password authentication. Recently, an 
RFC draft has added support for an IS-IS MD5.
Routers in a common subnetwork (Ethernet, private line) use link authentication. The clear-text 
password must be common only between the routers in the link. Level 1 and Level 2 routes use 
separate passwords.
With area authentication, all routers in the area must use authentication and must have the same 
password.

IS-IS Areas and Router Types
Only L2 and L1/L2 routers use domain authentication. All L2 and L1/L2 routers must be conﬁgured 
for authentication and must use the same password.

This chapter covers the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to exchange routes 
between autonomous systems. It is most frequently used between enterprises and service pro-
viders. This chapter also covers the redistribution of route information between routing proto-
cols. The CCDA should know where redistribution occurs when required by the network design. 
This chapter also reviews policy-based routing (PBR) as a method to change the destination IP 
address based on policies. Finally, the chapter covers IP multicast protocols.

348     Chapter 14: Border Gateway Protocol, Redistribution, and IP Multicast
Foundation Topics
The “Foundation Topics” section includes discussions of BGP, PBR, route redistribution, and 
IP multicast protocols. The “BGP” section covers the characteristics and design of BGP. eBGP 
exchanges routes between autonomous systems. eBGP is commonly used between enterprises 
and their service providers.
The section “PBR and Route Redistribution” covers how you use PBR to change the destination 
address of packets based on policies. This section also covers the redistribution of route information 
between routing protocols.
The section “IP Multicast Review” covers multicast protocols such as IGMP, Cisco Group 
Management Protocol (CGMP), and Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocol.
BGP
This section covers BGP theory and design concepts. The current version of BGP, Version 4, is 
deﬁned in RFC 1771 (March 1995). BGP is an interdomain routing protocol. What this means 
is that you use BGP to exchange routing information between autonomous systems. The primary 
function of BGP is to provide and exchange network-reachability information between domains or 
autonomous systems. It is the de-facto standard for routing between service providers on the Internet 
due to its rich features. You can also use it to exchange routes in large internal networks. The Internet 
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) reserved TCP port 179 to identify the BGP protocol. BGPv4 
was created to provide CIDR, a feature that was not present in the earlier versions. BGP is a path-
vector routing protocol; it is neither a distance-vector nor link-state routing protocol.
BGP Neighbors
BGP is usually conﬁgured between two directly connected routers that belong to different auton-
omous systems. Each autonomous system is under different technical administration. BGP is 
NOTE
RFC 1519 describes CIDR, which provides the capability of forwarding packets based on 
IP preﬁxes only, with no concern for IP address class boundaries. CIDR was created as a means 
to constrain the growth of the routing tables in the Internet core through the summarization of IP 
addresses across network class boundaries. The early 1990s saw an increase in the growth of the 
Internet routing tables and a reduction of the Class B address space. CIDR provides a way for 
service providers to assign address blocks smaller than a Class B network but larger than a 
Class C network.

BGP     349
frequently used to connect the enterprise to service providers and to interconnect service providers, 
as shown in Figure 14-1. The routing protocol within the enterprise could be any interior gateway 
protocol (IGP). Common IGP choices include RIPv2, EIGRP, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and 
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS). BGPv4 is the only deployed exterior gateway 
protocol (EGP). AS numbers are a managed resource allocated by the IANA. In IP, the AS numbers 
64,512 through 65,534 are allocated to IANA and designated for private use. 
Figure 14-1
BGP Neighbors
Before two BGP routers can exchange routing updates, the routers must become established neigh-
bors. After BGP routers establish a TCP connection, exchange information, and accept the informa-
tion, they become established neighbors and start exchanging routing updates. If the neighbors do 
not reach an established state, they do not exchange BGP updates. The information exchanged 
before the neighbors are established includes the BGP version number, AS number, BGP router ID, 
and BGP capabilities.
eBGP
eBGP is the name used to describe BGP peering between neighbors in different autonomous sys-
tems. As required by RFC 1771, the eBGP peers share a common subnet. In Figure 14-2, all routers 
speak eBGP with routers in other autonomous systems. Within AS 500, the routers communicate 
using iBGP, which is covered next.

eBGP Used Between Autonomous Systems
iBGP
iBGP is the name used to describe the peering between BGP neighbors in the same AS. iBGP is used 
in transit autonomous systems. Transit autonomous systems forward trafﬁc from one external AS 
to another external AS. If transit autonomous systems did not use iBGP, the eBGP-learned routes 
would have to be redistributed into an IGP and then redistributed into the BGP process in another 
eBGP router. iBGP provides a better way to control the routes within the transit AS. With iBGP, the 
external route information (attributes) is forwarded. The various IGPs that might be used do not 
understand or forward BGP attributes, including AS paths, between eBGP routers.
Another use for iBGP is in large corporations where the IGP networks are in smaller independent 
routing domains along organizational or geographic boundaries. In Figure 14-3, a company decided 
to use three independent IGPs: one for the Americas; another for Asia and Australia; and another for 
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Routes are redistributed into an iBGP core.
Route Reﬂectors
iBGP requires that all routers be conﬁgured to establish a logical connection with all other iBGP 
routers. The logical connection is a TCP link between all iBGP-speaking routers. The routers in each 
TCP link become BGP peers. In large networks, the number of iBGP-meshed peers can become 
very large. Network administrators can use route reﬂectors to reduce the number of required mesh 
links between iBGP peers. Some routers are selected to become the route reﬂectors to serve several 
other routers that act as route-reﬂector clients. Route reﬂectors allow a router to advertise or reﬂect 
routes to clients. The route reﬂector and its clients form a cluster. All client routers in the cluster peer 
with the route reﬂectors within the cluster. The route reﬂectors also peer with all other route 
reﬂectors in the internetwork. A cluster can have more than one route reﬂector.

Figure 14-3
iBGP in a Large Corporation
In Figure 14-4, without route reﬂectors, all iBGP routers are conﬁgured in an iBGP mesh as required 
by the protocol. When Routers A and G become route reﬂectors, they peer with Routers C and D; 
Router B becomes a route reﬂector for Routers E and F. Routers A, B, and G peer among each other.
Routers A and G are conﬁgured to peer with each other and with Routers B, C, and D. The conﬁg-
uration of Routers C and D is different from the rest; they are conﬁgured to peer with Routers A and 
G only. All route reﬂectors in the same cluster must have the same cluster ID number.
Router B is the route reﬂector for the second cluster. Router B peers with Routers A and G and with 
Routers E and F in its cluster. Routers E and F are route-reﬂector clients and peer only with Router B. 
If Router B goes down, the cluster on the right goes down because there is no second route reﬂector 
conﬁgured. 
Confederations
Another method to reduce the iBGP mesh within an AS is BGP confederations. With confedera-
tions, the AS is divided into smaller, private autonomous systems and the whole group is assigned 
a confederation ID. The private AS numbers or identiﬁers are not advertised to the Internet but are 
contained within the iBGP networks. The routers within each private AS are conﬁgured with the full 
iBGP mesh. Each private AS is conﬁgured with eBGP to communicate with other semi-autonomous 
systems in the confederation. External autonomous systems see only the AS number of the confed-
eration, and this number is conﬁgured with the BGP confederation identiﬁer.
NOTE
The combination of the route reﬂector and its clients is called a cluster. In Figure 14-4, 
Routers A, G, C, and D form a cluster. Routers B, E, and F form another cluster.

In Figure 14-5, a confederation divides the AS into two.
Routers A, B, and G are conﬁgured for eBGP between the private autonomous systems. You conﬁg-
ure these routers with the bgp confederation identiﬁer command. The confederation identiﬁer 
number is the same for all routers in the network. You use the bgp confederation command to iden-
tify the AS number of other private autonomous systems in the confederation. Because Routers A 
and G are in AS 10, the peer confederation to Router B is AS 20. Router B is in AS 20, and its peer 
confederation to Routers A and G is AS 10. Routers C and D are part of AS 10 and peer with each 
other and with Routers A and G. Routers E and F are part of AS 20 and peer with each other and 
with Router B.

The Cisco IOS Software assigns an administrative distance to eBGP and iBGP routes, as it does with 
other routing protocols. For the same preﬁx, the route with the lowest administrative distance is 
selected for inclusion in the IP forwarding table. Because iBGP-learned routes do not have metrics 
associated with the route as IGPs (OSPF and EIGRP) do, iBGP-learned routes are less trusted. For

BGP Attributes, Weight, and the BGP Decision Process
BGP is a protocol that uses route attributes to make a selection for the best path to a destination. This 
subsection describes BGP attributes, the use of weight to inﬂuence path selection, and the BGP 
decision process.
BGP Path Attributes
BGP uses several attributes for the path-selection process. BGP uses path attributes to communicate 
routing policies. BGP path attributes include next hop, local preference, AS path, origin, multi-exit 
discriminator (MED), atomic aggregate, and aggregator. Of these, the AS path is one of the most 
important attributes: it lists the number of AS paths to reach a destination network.
BGP attributes can be categorized as well-known or optional. Well-known attributes are recognized 
by all BGP implementations. Optional attributes do not have to be supported by the BGP process; 
they are used on a test or experimental basis.
Well-known attributes can be further subcategorized as mandatory or discretionary. Mandatory 
attributes are always included in BGP update messages. Discretionary attributes might or might not 
be included in the BGP update message.
Optional attributes can be further subcategorized as transitive or nontransitive. Routers must adver-
tise the route with transitive attributes to its peers even if is does not support the attribute locally. If 
the path attribute is nontransitive, the router does not have to advertise the route to its peers.
The subsections that follow cover each attribute category. 
Next-Hop Attribute
The next-hop attribute is the IP address of the next eBGP hop that will be used to reach the destina-
tion. The next-hop attribute is a well-known mandatory attribute. With eBGP, the eBGP peer sets 
the next hop when it announces the route. Multiaccess networks use the next-hop attribute where 
there is more than one BGP router. 
Local Preference Attribute
The local preference attribute indicates which path to use to exit the AS. It is a well-known discre-
tionary attribute used between iBGP peers and not passed on to external BGP peers. In Cisco IOS 
Software, the default local preference is 100. The higher local preference is preferred. 
The default local preference is conﬁgured on the BGP router with an external path; it then advertises 
its local preference to internal iBGP peers. Figure 14-6 shows an example of the local preference 
attribute where Routers B and C are conﬁgured with different local preference values. Router A and 
other iBGP routers then receive routes from both Router B and Router C. Router A prefers using 

BGP     355
Router C to route Internet packets because it has a higher local preference (400) than Router B 
(300). The arrows represent the paths taken to go out of the AS.
Figure 14-6
BGP Local Preference
Origin Attribute
Origin is a well-known mandatory attribute that deﬁnes the source of the path information. Do not 
confuse the origin with comparing whether the route is external (eBGP) or internal (iBGP). The 
origin attribute is received from the source BGP router. There are three types:
I
IGP—Indicated by an i in the BGP table. Present when the route is learned by way of the 
network statement.
I
EGP—Indicated by an e in the BGP table. Learned from EGP.
I
Incomplete—Indicated by a ? in the BGP table. Learned from static redistribution of the route.
In terms of choosing a route based on origin, BGP prefers routes that have been veriﬁed by an IGP 
over routes that have been learned from EGP peers, and BGP prefers routes learned from eBGP 
peers over incomplete paths.
AS Path Attribute
The AS path is a well-known mandatory attribute that contains a list of AS numbers in the path to 
the destination. Each AS prepends its own AS number to the AS path. The AS path describes all the

autonomous systems a packet would have to travel to reach the destination IP network. It is used to 
ensure that the path is loop-free. When the AS path attribute is used to select a path, the route with 
the least number of AS hops is preferred. In the case of a tie, other attributes, such as MED, break 
the tie. Example 14-1 shows the AS path for network 200.50.32.0/19. To reach the destination, a 
packet must pass autonomous systems 3561, 7004, and 7418. The command show ip bgp 
200.50.32.0 displays the AS path information.
MED Attribute
The MED attribute, also known as metric, tells external BGP peers the preferred path into the AS 
when there are multiple paths into the AS. In other words, MED inﬂuences which one of many paths 
a neighboring AS will use to reach destinations within the AS. It is an optional nontransitive attribute 
carried in eBGP updates. The MED attribute is not used with iBGP peers. The lowest MED value is 
preferred, and the default value is 0. Paths received with no MED are assigned a MED of 0. The 
MED is not compared for paths received from two separated autonomous systems. The MED is 
carried into an AS but does not leave the AS.
Consider the diagram in Figure 14-7. With all attributes considered equal, Router C will select 
Router A as its best path into AS 100 based on Router A’s lower router ID (RID). Router A is 
conﬁgured with a MED of 200 to make Router C select Router B as the best path to AS 100. No 
additional conﬁguration is required on Router B because the default MED is 0.
Community Attribute
Although not an attribute used in the routing-decision process, the community attribute groups 
routes and applies policies or decisions (accept, prefer) to those routes. It is a group of destinations 
that share some common property. The community attribute is an optional transitive attribute of 
variable length.
Atomic Aggregate and Aggregator Attributes
The atomic aggregate attribute informs BGP peers that the local router used a less speciﬁc 
(aggregated) route to a destination without using a more speciﬁc route. 
Example 14-1

MED Attribute
If a BGP router selects a less speciﬁc route when there is a more speciﬁc route available, it must 
attach the atomic aggregate attribute when propagating the route. The atomic aggregate attribute lets 
the BGP peers know that the BGP router used an aggregated route. A more speciﬁc route must be 
in the advertising router’s BGP table before it will propagate an aggregate route.
When the atomic aggregate attribute is used, the BGP speaker has the option to send the aggregator 
attribute. The aggregator attribute includes the AS number and the IP address of the router that 
originated the aggregated route. In Cisco routers, the IP address used is the RID of the router that 
performs the route aggregation. Atomic aggregate is a well-known discretionary attribute, and 
aggregator is an optional transitive attribute.
Weight
Weight is assigned locally on a router to specify a preferred path if multiple paths exist out of a 
router for a destination. Weights can be applied to individual routes or to all routes received from 
a peer. Weight is speciﬁc to Cisco routers and is not propagated to other routers. The weight value 
ranges from 0 to 65,535. Routes with a higher weight are preferred when multiple routes exist to 
a destination. Routes that are originated by the local router have a default weight of 32,768. 
You can use weight instead of local preference to inﬂuence the selected path to external BGP peers. 
The difference is that weight is conﬁgured locally and not exchanged in BGP updates. On the other 
hand, the local preference attribute is exchanged between iBGP peers and is conﬁgured at the 
gateway router.

Figure 14-8
BGP Weight
When the same destinations are advertised from both Router B and Router C in Figure 14-8, Router A 
prefers the routes from Router C over Router B because the routes received from Router C have a 
larger weight (600) locally assigned.
BGP Decision Process
By default, BGP will select only a single path to reach a speciﬁc destination (unless you specify 
maximum paths). The Cisco implementation of BGP uses a simple decision process. When the path 
is selected, BGP puts the selected path in its routing table and propagates the path to its neighbors.
To select the best path to a destination, Cisco routers running BGP use the following algorithm in 
the following order:
1.
If the speciﬁed next hop is inaccessible, drop the path.
2.
If the path is internal, synchronization is enabled, and the path is not in the IGP, drop the path.
3.
Prefer the path with the largest weight. (This step is Cisco speciﬁc and weight is localized to 
the router.)
4.
Prefer the path with the largest local preference. iBGP uses this path only to reach the preferred 
external BGP router.

5.
Prefer the path that was locally originated via a network or aggregate BGP subcommand or 
through redistribution from an IGP. Local paths sourced by network or redistribute commands 
are preferred over local aggregates sourced by the aggregate-address command. (This step is 
Cisco speciﬁc.)
6.
If no route was originated, prefer the route that has the shortest AS path. (This step is Cisco 
speciﬁc.)
7.
If all paths have the same AS path length, prefer the path with the lowest origin type. Paths with 
origin type of IGP are (lower) preferred over paths originated from an EGP like BGP, and EGP 
origin is preferred over a route with an incomplete origin. (This step is Cisco speciﬁc.)
8.
If the origin codes are the same, prefer the path with the lowest MED attribute. An eBGP peer 
uses this attribute to select a best path to AS. (This step is a tie-breaker described in the RFC 
that deﬁnes the BGP.)
9.
If the paths have the same MED, prefer the external path (eBGP) over the internal (iBGP) path. 
(This step is Cisco speciﬁc.)
10.
If the paths are still the same, prefer the path through the closest IGP neighbor (best IGP 
metric). (This step is a tie-breaker described in the RFC that deﬁnes the BGP.) 
11.
Prefer the path with the BGP neighbor with the lowest router ID. (The RFC that deﬁnes the 
BGP describes the router ID.) 
After BGP decides on a best path, it marks it with a > sign in the show ip bgp table and adds it to 
the IP routing table.

PBR and Route Redistribution
This section covers PBR and route redistribution. You can use PBR to modify the next hop of pack-
ets from what is selected by the routing protocol. PBR is useful when the trafﬁc engineering of paths 
is required. Redistribution between routing protocols is required to inject route information from 
one routing protocol to another. The CCDA must understand the issues with the redistribution of 
routes. 
PBR
You can use PBR to modify the next-hop address of packets or mark packets to receive differential 
service. Routing is based on destination addresses; routers look at the routing table to determine the 
next-hop IP address based on a destination lookup. PBR is commonly used to modify the next-hop 
IP address based on the source address. You can also use PBR to mark the IP precedence bits in 
outbound IP packets so that you can apply quality-of-service (QoS) policies. In Figure 14-9, Router 
A exchanges routing updates with routers in the WAN. The routing protocol might select Serial 0 as 
the preferred path for all trafﬁc because of the higher bandwidth. The company might have business-
critical systems that use the T1 but does not want systems on Ethernet 1 to affect WAN performance. 
You can conﬁgure PBR on Router A to force trafﬁc from Ethernet 1 out on Serial 1.
Figure 14-9
PBR
Redistribution
You conﬁgure the redistribution of routing protocols on routers that reside at the Service Provider 
Edge of the network that also communicate with other autonomous systems or on routers that run 
more than one routing protocol. The redistribution of routes might be required when two companies 
merge: One might be running EIGRP and the other OSPF.
Figure 14-10 shows an example of the exchange of routes between two autonomous systems. Routes 
from AS 100 are redistributed into BGP on Router A. Routes from AS 200 are redistributed into 
BGP on Router B. Then, Routers A and B exchange BGP routes. Router A and Router B also 
implement ﬁlters to redistribute only the desired networks.

Redistribution of BGP Routes
Companies might also acquire another company that might be running another routing protocol. 
Figure 14-11 shows an example of a network that has both OSPF and EIGRP routing protocols. 
Routers A and B perform redistribution between OSPF and EIGRP. Both routers must ﬁlter routes 
from OSPF before redistributing them into EIGRP and ﬁlter routes from EIGRP before 
redistributing them into OSPF. This setup prevents route feedback.
Route feedback occurs when a routing protocol learns routes from another routing protocol and then 
announces the routes back to the other routing protocol. In Figure 14-11, OSPF should not announce 
the routes it learned from EIGRP, and EIGRP should not announce the routes it learned from OSPF.
Figure 14-11
Redistribution Between IGPs
You can use access lists, distribution lists, and route maps when redistributing routes; you can use 
these methods to specify (select) routes for redistribution, to set metrics, or to set other policies to 
the routes.

Default Metric
When redistributing routes into RIP, IGRP, IS-IS, and EIGRP, you must also conﬁgure the metric of 
the redistributed routes. You can conﬁgure the metric in the redistribution command or conﬁgure 
a default metric. You can also use the command in OSPF. IS-IS does not use the default-metric 
command. The default-metric command has the following syntax for IGRP and EIGRP:
default-metric bandwidth delay reliability load mtu
EIGRP-IGRP Redistribution
For routers that run both IGRP and EIGRP, the network designer must be aware of the following:
I
If EIGRP and IGRP have the same system number, the router automatically redistributes 
between the routing protocols without your having to conﬁgure redistribution.
I
If EIGRP and IGRP have a different number, then you must conﬁgure redistribution to have 
EIGRP and IGRP exchange routes.
OSPF Redistribution
This subsection reviews a few things you need to remember when designing a network that will be 
redistributing with OSPF. 
When redistributing routes into OSPF, use the subnets keyword to permit subnetted routes to be 
received. If you do not use it, only the major network route will be redistributed, without any 
subnetworks. In other words, OSPF performs automatic summarization to IP classful network 
values.
By default, redistributed routes are classiﬁed as external Type 2 (E2) in OSPF. You can use the 
metric-type keyword to change the external route to an external Type 1 (E1). The network design 
can take into account the after-redistribution cost (Type 2) or the after-redistribution cost plus the 
cost of the path (Type 1).
In Figure 14-12, Router B is conﬁgured to perform mutual redistribution between EIGRP and OSPF. 
In this example, you can use route maps and access lists to prevent routing loops. The route maps 
permit or deny the networks that are listed in the access lists. The subnets keyword redistributes 
every subnet in EIGRP into OSPF. This book does not cover exact conﬁgurations.
NOTE
eBGP and iBGP also automatically redistribute if the BGP conﬁguration for BGP peers 
uses the same AS number.

IP Multicast Review
With multicast, packets are sent to a multicast group, which is identiﬁed with an IP multicast 
address. Multicast supports the transmission of IP packets from one source to multiple hosts. 
Packets with unicast addresses are sent to one device, and broadcast addresses are sent to all 
hosts; packets with multicast addresses are sent to a group of hosts. 
Multicast Addresses
Multicast addressing uses Class D addresses from the IPv4 protocol. Class D addresses range from 
224.0.0.1 to 239.255.255.255. IANA manages multicast addresses.
Routing protocols (RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPF) use multicast addresses to speak to their neighbors. 
For example, OSPF routers use 224.0.0.6 to speak to the designated router (DR) in a multiaccess 
network. Class D multicast address range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. Multicast addresses 
in the range of 224.0.0.1 to 224.255.255.255 are reserved for special addresses or network protocol 
on a multiaccess link. RFC 2365 reserves multicast addresses in the range of 239.192.000.000 to 
239.251.255.255 for organization-local scope. Similarly, 239.252.000.000 to 239.252.255.255, 
239.254.000.000 to 239.254.255.255, and 239.255.000.000 to 239.255.255.255 are reserved for 
site-local scope.

Layer 3 to Layer 2 Mapping
Multicast-aware Ethernet, Token Ring, and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network inter-
face cards use the reserved IEEE 802 address 0100.5e00.0000 for multicast addresses at the MAC 
layer. Notice that for the address, the high-order byte 0x01 has the low-order bit set to 1. This bit is 
the Individual/Group (I/G) bit. It signiﬁes whether the address is an individual address (0) or a group 
address (1). Hence, for multicast addresses, this bit is set to 1.
Ethernet interfaces map the lower 23 bits of the IP multicast address to the lower 23 bits of the MAC 
0100.5e00.0000. As an example, the IP multicast address 224.0.0.2 is mapped to the MAC layer 
as 0100.5e00.0002. Figure 14-13 shows another example looking at the bits of multicast IP 
239.192.44.56. The IP address in hexadecimal is EF:C0:2C:38. The lower 23 bits get mapped 
into the lower 23 bits of the base multicast MAC to produce the multicast MAC address 
01:00:5E:40:2C:38.

IGMP
IGMP is the protocol used in multicast implementations between the end hosts and the local router. 
RFC 2236 describes IGMP Version 2 (IGMPv2). RFC 3376 describes IGMP Version 3 (IGMPv3). 
RFC 1112 describes the ﬁrst version of IGMP. 
IP hosts use IGMP to report their multicast group memberships to routers. IGMP messages use IP 
protocol number 2. IGMP messages are limited to the local interface and are not routed. 
IGMP v1
The ﬁrst RFC describing IGMP (RFC 1112), written in 1989, describes the host extension of 
multicasting. IGMPv1 provides simple message types for communication between hosts and 
routers. These messages are
I
Membership query—Sent by the host to request to join a multicast group
I
Membership report—Sent by the router to check whether there are still hosts in multicast 
groups in the segment
The problem with IGMPv1 is the latency involved for a host to leave a group. With IGMPv1, the 
router sends out membership reports periodically; a host must wait for the membership-report 
message to leave a group. The query interval is 60 seconds, and it takes three query intervals 
(3 minutes) for a host to leave the group.
IGMP v2
IGMPv2 improves over IGMPv1 by allowing faster termination or leaving of multicast groups.

IGMPv2 has three message types, plus one for backward-compatibility:
I
Membership query—Sent to indicate that a host wants to join a group.
I
Version 2 membership report—Message sent to the group address with the multicast group 
members (IP addresses). It is sent to verify whether there are still hosts in multicast groups on 
the segment.
I
Version 2 leave group—Sent by the hosts to indicate that a host will leave a group, to 
destination 224.0.0.2. The message is sent without having to wait for the IGMPv2 membership-
report message.
I
Version 1 membership report—For backward-compatibility with IGMPv1 hosts.
You enable IGMP on an interface when you conﬁgure a multicast routing protocol, such as PIM. 
You can conﬁgure the interface for IGMPv1 or IGMPv2.
IGMP v3
IGMPv3 provides the extensions required to support source-speciﬁc multicast (SSM). It is designed 
to be backward-compatible with both prior versions of IGMP.
IGMPv3 has two message types, plus three for backward-compatibility:
I
Membership query—Sent to indicate that a host wants to join a group.
I
Version 3 membership report—Message sent to the group address with the multicast group 
members (IP addresses). It is sent to verify whether there are still hosts in multicast groups on 
the segment.
I
Version 2 membership report—Message sent to the group address with the multicast group 
members (IP addresses). It is sent to verify whether there are still hosts in multicast groups on 
the segment. This message is used for backward-compatibility with IGMPv2 hosts.
I
Version 2 leave group—Sent by the hosts to indicate that a host will leave a group, to 
destination 224.0.0.2. The message is sent without having to wait for the IGMPv2 membership-
report message. This message is used for backward-compatibility with IGMPv2 hosts.
I
Version 1 membership report—This message is used for backward-compatibility with 
IGMPv1 hosts.
You enable IGMP on an interface when you enable a multicast routing protocol, such as PIM. You 
can conﬁgure the interface for IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or IGMPv3.

IP Multicast Review     367
CGMP
CGMP is a Cisco proprietary protocol implemented to control multicast trafﬁc at Layer 2. Because 
a Layer 2 switch is not aware of Layer 3 IGMP messages, it cannot restrain multicast packets from 
being sent to all ports. 
As shown in Figure 14-14, with CGMP the LAN switch can speak with the IGMP router to ﬁnd out 
the MAC addresses of the hosts that want to receive the multicast packets. With CGMP, switches 
distribute multicast sessions only to the switch ports that have group members.
Figure 14-14
CGMP
When a router receives an IGMP report, it processes the report and then sends a CGMP message to 
the switch. The switch can then forward the multicast messages to the port with the host receiving 
multicast trafﬁc. CGMP fast-leave processing allows the switch to detect IGMP Version 2 leave 
messages sent by hosts on any of the switch ports. When a host sends the IGMPv2 leave message, 
the switch can then disable multicasting for the port.
IGMP Snooping
IGMP snooping is another way for switches to control multicast trafﬁc at Layer 2. It listens to IGMP 
messages between the hosts and routers. If a host sends an IGMP query message to the router, the 
switch adds the host to the multicast group and permits that port to receive multicast trafﬁc. The port 
is removed from multicast trafﬁc if the host sends an IGMP leave message to the router. The disad-
vantage of IGMP snooping is that it has to process every IGMP control message, which can impact 
the CPU utilization of the switch.

Sparse Versus Dense Multicast Routing Protocols 
IP multicast trafﬁc for a particular (source, destination group) multicast pair is transmitted from the 
source to the receivers using a spanning tree from the source that connects all the hosts in the group. 
Each destination host registers itself as a member in interesting multicast groups through the use of 
IGMP. Routers keep track of these groups dynamically and build distribution trees that chart paths 
from each sender to all receivers. IP multicast routing protocols follow two approaches.
The ﬁrst approach assumes that the multicast group members are densely distributed throughout the 
network (many of the subnets contain at least one group member) and that bandwidth is plentiful. 
The approach with dense multicast routing protocols is to ﬂood the trafﬁc throughout the network 
and then, at the request of receiving routers, stop the ﬂow of trafﬁc on branches of the network that 
have no members of the multicast group. Multicast routing protocols that follow this technique of 
ﬂooding the network include DVMRP, Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF), and Protocol 
Independent Multicast-Dense Mode (PIM-DM).
The second approach to multicast routing assumes that multicast group members are sparsely dis-
tributed throughout the network and that bandwidth is not necessarily widely available. Sparse mode 
does not imply that the group has few members, just that they are widely dispersed. The approach 
with sparse multicast routing protocols is to not send trafﬁc until it is requested by the receiving 
routers or hosts. Multicast routing protocols of this type are Core Based Trees (CBT) and Protocol 
Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM). CBT is not widely deployed and is not discussed 
in this guide.
Multicast Source and Shared Trees
Multicast distribution trees control the path multicast packets take to the destination hosts. The two 
types of distribution trees are source and shared. With source trees, the tree roots from the source of 
the multicast group and then expands throughout the network in spanning-tree fashion to the desti-
nation hosts. Source trees are also called shortest-path trees (SPT) because they create paths without 
having to go through a rendezvous point (RP). The drawback is that all routers through the path must 
use memory resources to maintain a list of all multicast groups. PIM-DM uses a source-based tree. 
Shared trees create the root of the distribution tree somewhere between the source and the receivers 
of the network. The root is called the RP. The tree is created from the RP in spanning-tree fashion 
with no loops. The advantage of shared trees is that they reduce the memory requirements of routers 
in the multicast network. The drawback is that initially the multicast packets might not take the best 
paths to the receivers because they need to pass through the RP. After the data stream begins to ﬂow 
from sender to RP to receiver, the routers in the path optimize the path automatically to remove any 
unnecessary hops. The RP function consumes signiﬁcant memory on the assigned router. PIM-SM 
uses an RP. 

IP Multicast Review     369
PIM
PIM comes in two ﬂavors: sparse mode (PIM-SM) and dense mode (PIM-DM). The ﬁrst uses shared 
trees and RPs to reach widely dispersed group members with reasonable protocol bandwidth efﬁ-
ciency. The second uses source trees and reverse path forwarding (RPF) to reach relatively near 
group members with reasonable processor and memory efﬁciency in the network devices of the 
distribution trees.
With RPF, received multicast packets are forwarded out all other interfaces, allowing the data stream 
to reach all segments. If no hosts are members of a multicast group on any of the router’s attached 
or downstream subnets, the router sends a prune message up the distribution tree (the reverse 
path) to inform the upstream router to not send packets for the multicast group. So, the analogy 
for PIM-DM is the push method for sending junk mail, and the intermediate router must tell 
upstream devices to stop sending it.
PIM-SM
PIM-SM is deﬁned in RFC 2362 (experimental). PIM-SM assumes that no hosts want to receive 
multicast trafﬁc unless speciﬁcally requested. In PIM-SM, a router is selected as the RP. The RP has 
the task of gathering the information from senders and making the information available to receiv-
ers. Routers with receivers have to register with the RP. The end-host systems request multicast 
group membership using IGMP with their local routers. The routers serving the end systems then 
register as trafﬁc receivers with the RPs for the speciﬁed group in the multicast network.
Joining PIM-SM
With PIM-SM, DRs on end segments receive IGMP query messages from hosts wanting to join a 
multicast group. The router checks whether it is already receiving the group for another interface. If 
it is receiving the group, the router adds the new interface to the table and sends membership reports 
periodically on the new interface.
If the multicast group is not in the multicast table, the router adds the interface to the multicast table 
and sends a join message to the RP with multicast address 224.0.0.13 (all PIM routers) requesting 
the multicast group.
Pruning PIM-SM
When a PIM-SM does not have any more multicast receiving hosts or receiving routers out any of 
its interfaces, it sends a prune message to the RP. The prune message includes the group to be pruned 
or removed.

370     Chapter 14: Border Gateway Protocol, Redistribution, and IP Multicast
PIM DR
A designated router is selected in multiaccess segments running PIM. The PIM DR is responsible 
for sending join, prune, and register messages to the RP. The PIM router with the highest IP address 
is selected as the DR.
Auto-RP 
Another way to conﬁgure the RP for the network is to have the RP announce its services to the PIM 
network. This process is called auto-RP. Candidate RPs send their announcements to RP mapping 
agents with multicast address 224.0.1.39 (cisco-rp-announce). RP mapping agents are also conﬁg-
ured. In smaller networks, the RP can be the mapping agent. Conﬁgured RP mapping agents listen 
to the announcements. The RP mapping agent then selects the RP for a group based on the highest 
IP address of all the candidate RPs. The RP mapping agents then send RP-discovery messages to 
the rest of the PIM-SM routers in the internetwork with the selected RP-to-group mappings. 
PIMv2 Bootstrap Router
Instead of using auto-RP, you can conﬁgure a PIMv2 bootstrap router (BSR) to automatically select 
an RP for the network. The RFC for PIM Version 2, RFC 2362, describes BSR. With BSR, you con-
ﬁgure BSR candidates (C-BSRs) with priorities from 0 to 255 and a BSR address. C-BSRs exchange 
bootstrap messages. Bootstrap messages are sent to multicast IP 224.0.0.13 (all PIM routers). If a 
C-BSR receives a bootstrap message, it compares it with its own. The largest priority C-BSR is 
selected as the BSR.
After the BSR is selected for the network, it collects a list of candidate RPs. The BSR selects 
RP-to-group mappings, which is called the RP set, and distributes the selected RPs using bootstrap 
messages sent to 224.0.0.13 (all PIM routers).
DVMRP
RFC 1075 describes DVMRP. It is the primary multicast routing protocol used in the multicast 
backbone (MBONE). The MBONE is used in the research community. 
DVMRP operates in the dense mode using RPF by having routers send a copy of a multicast packet 
out all paths. Routers that receive the multicast packets then send prune messages back to their 
upstream neighbor router to stop a data stream if there are no downstream receivers of the multicast 
group (either receiving routers or hosts on connected segments). DVMRP implements its own 
unicast routing protocol, similar to RIP, based on hop counts. DVMRP has a 32 hop-count limit. 
DVMRP does not scale suboptimally. The Cisco support of DVMRP is partial; DVMRP networks 
are usually implemented on UNIX machines running the mrouted process. A DVMRP tunnel is 
typically used to connect to the MBONE DVMRP network.

Introduction to Threats     383
Foundation Topics
Before designing network-security services and comprehending how each module of the SAFE 
blueprint addresses security threats, it is critical to understand the different types of attacks that are 
common to various parts of the architecture. After you install the security-based solution, security 
management and monitoring, as for all other systems, is a requirement.
Introduction to Threats
This section is devoted to listing the threats that are deﬁned for SAFE. Remember that anticipating 
the threats for each of the modules of SAFE is the basis for designing the solution. Cisco starts you 
on this process by providing you a list of the common threats and the associated solutions. The 
threats appear with a description of how they function. This arrangement helps you categorize new 
attacks as they appear. Understanding the basic principles of an attack and its mitigation is a foun-
dational strategy for SAFE.
You can use two common techniques to detect attacks and record details of the episode. The ﬁrst 
involves (automated) inspection of the device logs, which most devices can generate. The second is 
using an IDS, which recognizes patterns of activity (signatures) that reﬂect known attacks.
You analyze logs to recognize the “m.o.” of an attack. The modus operandi of an attack is the 
offender’s action while committing the crime. Logs can be helpful in identifying early warning signs 
that do not always trigger an alarm. Reviewing logs is a daunting task, however; some applications 
have a subscription service with preprogrammed patterns to review logs. The subscription ensures 
that the log review coordinates with current patterns. More importantly, it enables you to review a 
large quantity of logs with efﬁciency. The section “Secure Monitoring” later in the chapter provides 
more details.
There are two categories of IDS, which can trigger an alarm when it detects an attack that it 
recognizes; sometimes, it is also capable of countering the attack. A network-based IDS (NIDS) 
can scan a particular segment, or you can get a host-based IDS (HIDS).
Human diligence is necessary to thwart new attacks as well as technological efforts by IDSs. 
Subscribing to mailing lists and checking various security sites must be part of the daily 
management routine. Common sources for security information are
I
Vendor sites for patches and bug ﬁxes

Bugtraq (http://www.securityfocus.com)

Before discussing the speciﬁc attacks, review the following diagrams of the different functional 
areas as deﬁned in SAFE and their associated modules. Figure 15-1 shows the functional area called 
the Enterprise Campus.
Figure 15-1
Enterprise Campus and Detail of Modules
Figure 15-2 is the functional area called the Enterprise Edge. Note the positioning and the modules 
that make up the Enterprise Edge. By understanding its functions, you can accurately identify the 
types of attacks it is vulnerable to.

Network Reconnaissance
Network reconnaissance refers to learning information about a target network using publicly 
available information and applications such as Domain Name System (DNS) queries, ping sweeps, 
and port scans.
IDSs at the network and host levels can usually notify an administrator when a reconnaissance 
attack is underway. This alert allows the administrator to better prepare for the coming attack or to 
notify the ISP that is hosting the system that is launching the reconnaissance attack.

reconnaissance attacks.

Packet Snifﬁng
Useful network tools can become threats in the hands of a hacker. A packet sniffer provides an example 
of how someone can exploit a tool used to capture all packets on physical wire (promiscuous mode). 
A packet-sniffer application is common tool for trafﬁc analysis and troubleshooting by capturing 
and decoding packets. You can use packet sniffers to capture and inspect all unencrypted data (clear 
text), which can include usernames and passwords or critical information. Hackers can use this 
information to attack the network and user applications.
Some ways to prevent packet-snifﬁng attacks include authentication, cryptography, and network 
segmenting: 
I
Authentication methods such as two-factor authentication (using token cards that generate a 
random password, which is used in conjunction with a user password), which uses a one-time 
password, mitigate subsequent attacks using false credentials for authentication and some 
replay attacks.
I
Cryptography is the most common and effective method of securing data against sniffers 
because it scrambles the clear text. IP Security (IPSec), SSH, and SSL are common encryption 
protocols.
I
Segmenting the network using switches can help to localize the sniffer’s activity.
Table 15-3 lists the most commonly affected modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by 
packet snifﬁng.

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks     387
Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
By using packet sniffers or type products, it is possible to capture information as it is transferred 
from one network to another. This type of attack requires access to the network media or devices 
between the source and destination. Wireless LAN technologies are particularly susceptible to this 
kind of attack. Rogue employees responsible for the enterprise or service-provider networks can 
also conduct them. Attackers can use the information captured to launch other attacks that deny 
service, obtain vital information, subvert applications, or corrupt data stores.
Use strong encryption so that if packets are sniffed, they are useless to the attacker. Mandatory use 
of encrypted VPN connections mitigates the inherent vulnerability of wireless LANs. It is possible 
to thwart encryption methods if the hacker obtains information about the encryption process, such 
as keys.

IP Spooﬁng
IP spooﬁng is a technique in which the attacker sends packets with the source IP address modiﬁed 
to match that of a trusted host. IP spooﬁng can also disguise the source of packets launched as part 
of a DoS attack.
Some ways to prevent IP spooﬁng attacks are authentication and ﬁltering: 
I
Authentication prevents access to systems based solely on IP address.
I
With ﬁltering (see RFC 2827), you can prevent a network’s users from spooﬁng other networks 
from your networks by preventing any outbound trafﬁc on your network that does not have a 
source address in your organization’s own IP range. 
Table 15-5 lists the most commonly affected modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by 
IP spooﬁng attacks.
 DoS
DoS attacks deny legitimate users access to services. DoS attacks are characterized by disrupting 
connectivity between devices, preventing access to speciﬁc services, halting processes on devices 
by sending bad packets, and ﬂooding networks.
Some ways to prevent DoS attacks follow: 
I
Properly conﬁgure ﬁrewalls and routers to prevent DoS attacks. You can ﬁnd these 
conﬁgurations on vendor and security websites.
I
Prevent spooﬁng.
I
Prevent trafﬁc rates from getting out of control.

Password Attacks     389
Table 15-6 lists the most commonly affected modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by 
DoS attacks.
Password Attacks
Password attacks can use information “sniffed” from a network or gained through user inattention 
or carelessness. Another password attack is the brute-force attack. The attacker uses known, or 
inferred, usernames and a sequence of guessed passwords against each username until she gains 
access, she abandons the attack as too difﬁcult, or something counters the attack. These attacks often 
succeed because administrators and users have not changed documented default passwords. When 
an attacker determines a username and password, he can use the same information to attack multiple 
systems or applications—because individuals frequently reuse passwords. When an exploit has 
gained access to a system or application, the attacker might be able to create a backdoor, which gives 
him network access at a later time.
Some ways to prevent password attacks follow: 
I
Use a password format that is not easy to guess or decipher: 
— Avoid using personal information such as child, spouse, or pet names, birthdates, 
anniversary dates, etc.
— Avoid using names, dates, or words that appear in a standard dictionary.  
— Include a mixture of alphabetic and numeric characters with at least one special character 
(such as !, @, and $) in the middle of the password.  
I
Do not post passwords on your workstation, bulletin board, or any other conspicuous place.   
I
Do not store the password and ID together.

password attacks.

Port Redirection
Port-redirection attacks use a compromised host to pass trafﬁc through a ﬁrewall that would 
otherwise be dropped. An example of an application that can provide this type of access is Netcat. 
For more information, refer to the website http://insecure.org/tools.html.
Mitigation strategies include using trust models, as described in the next section on “Trust 
Exploitation,” or deploying IDSs in the network.
Table 15-8 lists the most commonly affected modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by 
port-redirection attacks.
Trust Exploitation
Trust exploitation is not a name of an attack, but it is a description of how an attack works. As 
its name suggests, it is when a trusted source on a network takes advantage of its position. This 
vulnerability applies to systems as well so that if one device on a segment is compromised, it can 
lead to other systems being compromised on the same segment. This vulnerability is a key reason 
that SAFE divides the network into logical groups based on access needs.
By managing system access with assigned trust levels, you can make sure that systems on the 
outside of a ﬁrewall are never trusted by systems inside the ﬁrewall.

Unauthorized Access     391
Table 15-9 lists the most commonly affected modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by 
trust exploitation.
Unauthorized Access
Although this attack doesn’t have a fancy name, it is often the ﬁrst breach that occurs. The best way 
to prevent attacks is to prevent access to possible entry points. This prevention includes securing 
ports, passwords, and applications. Unauthorized access frequently follows a successful password 
attack.
You should secure access to a module with a ﬁrewall. The ﬁltering on this ﬁrewall will secure all 
inbound trafﬁc and outbound trafﬁc from this module to others.

unauthorized access.

Application-Layer Attacks
Application-layer attacks often use port access through ﬁrewalls to gain entry to your systems, using 
the same ports opened to enable you to access the services you need, such as web servers that use 
port 80. Once the hacker exploits an opening, she can gain access to systems. Many application-
layer attacks are launched against security holes in the software. Many platforms required advance 
conﬁguration to “lock down” access methods so that the user can deﬁne his own level of security. 
Another common attack method is to gain access using an administrator-level account. This access 
would allow unrestricted use of the servers, applications and utilities. The administrator-level 
account is used to verify warnings in log ﬁles and to provide ﬁxes for these applications, but it means 
that the hacker has access to the same information.
Some ways to prevent application-layer attacks follow: 
I
Keep applications, utilities, and servers current with the latest supported patches and ﬁxes.
I
Restrict access to applications using strong authentication.
I
Use logging to capture data and access information.
I
Secure trafﬁc access to applications.
I
Block inbound access using ﬁlters.
Table 15-11 lists the most commonly affected modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by 
application-layer attacks.
Virus and Trojan-Horse Applications
There are two common end-user host attacks. A virus is malicious code that is attached to another 
program. You activate the virus by running the infected program or opening the infected ﬁle, and 
it performs its intended tasks. These tasks can range from relatively benign distractions to the 
catastrophic destruction of local system capabilities. The virus can propagate itself to other devices. 
The only difference in a Trojan horse is that it disguises itself as an application that looks like 
something else. Worms are self-replicating malicious code that exploit a vulnerability on servers.

You can contain these kinds of applications through the effective use of antivirus software at the user 
level and potentially at the network level. Antivirus software can detect most viruses and many 
Trojan applications and prevent them from spreading in the network. Keeping up-to-date with the 
latest developments in these sorts of attacks is the only way to ensure that you will be protected 
against new attacks. The only problem you will encounter is if the applications do not know how to 
manage newer types of attacks.
Table 15-12 lists the most commonly affected modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by 
virus and Trojan applications.
Introduction to Secure Monitoring and Management
The security-based solution that you install requires management and monitoring just like all other 
systems. This section addresses the requirements for establishing security management. You can 
apply these suggestions to other systems as well.
You can use products such as IDSs to continuously monitor systems and alert security managers to 
breaches. The Cisco IDS also can perform mitigation tasks to stop the breach in progress to minimize 
the damage. In addition, you can use regular vulnerability and penetration assessments to test your 
security solution to identify possible security holes. These tests ensure that changes to your network 
and your security solutions work the way you expect them to work.
Secure Monitoring
A component of secure monitoring is reviewing log information for the security devices. As 
discussed in the beginning of the chapter, logs play an important role, but knowing how to manage 
them is key. Logs can be generated quickly over a short period of time. If you multiply large 
quantities of logs by the number of devices, you can feel overwhelmed by the task of reviewing 
them. In addition, you have to know what you are looking for in the logs; just having them is not 
enough. If you are not going to use the logs or manage them correctly, don’t bother collecting them. 
However, you can use these logs as evidence if legal action is required. If you do not organize the 
logs, it will be extremely difﬁcult to locate the proper logs if required. 
Syslog is a common way to collect and store logs. Syslog lets you collect messages from devices to 
a server running a syslog daemon. In general, the syslog daemon runs on UNIX servers. Using

network-management tools, you can collect the syslogs from various devices and analyze them 
together. There is more to this practice than logging activity; logging changes to devices can be a 
valuable tool. Have you ever experienced a situation where you made changes to a system, and when 
the changes caused issues, you should have written down the changes? Change management can 
help you retrace your steps for troubleshooting, but having a log of conﬁgurations before and after 
you institute changes is even more useful. Good change-management practices should be part of 
your security strategy.
Collecting logs is not the only management process you can use to support security devices. Polling 
(pulling) logs from devices is one issue, but what about pushing data and applications to servers? 
How will you manage the push of data so that it isn’t compromised in transit? What if you have to 
manage a device that you can’t access?
Secure Management
Just as the security solution began with a security policy, secure management should begin with 
managing the security policy once it is in place. The policies that govern your solutions require 
maintenance. As the policies that guide the security solution change, you must make changes to the 
corporate security policy and to the conﬁgurations on the security devices that enforce this policy.
Cisco has a product called the Cisco Secure Policy Manager (CSPM) used to specify, manage, and 
audit the state of a security policy through browser-based user interfaces. This process enables the 
security manager to control large numbers of security elements in the network. Distributing security 
policy from a central management system increases the consistency of the policy implementation 
across multiple devices. Policies implemented centrally tend to be more comprehensive and effective 
because they consider the entire information system rather than just individual components.
Secure Management Communications
Network-device management requires that a communications channel be available to the network 
devices. Devices can support out-of-band management, in-band management, or both. In-band 
management consumes bandwidth that could otherwise be used by network trafﬁc. Out-of-band 
management increases bandwidth available for network trafﬁc and typically improves the privacy 
and security of network-management communications. You achieve the beneﬁts at the possible cost 
of designing, provisioning, and managing the management network itself. In any case, the 
management channel should be robust, private, and secure.
Out-of-Band Management
Preparing for the worst-case network-management scenario includes ensuring that there is a way to 
reach the devices when the usual access channel is unavailable. Out-of-band management using 

Auto Update Security     395
modem access through a management port is an attractive option when combined with authentica-
tion and access controls. When supported, secured VPN access in-band can provide access if you 
lose a management network. Directly connecting to management ports using serial communication 
cables is a ﬁnal, labor-intensive option.
Out-of-band management offers many signiﬁcant advantages and becomes more desirable as the 
managed network grows. In this case, you can perform real-time monitoring and access over a 
protected channel, which does not impact transport bandwidth availability. In a large network, the 
costs of provisioning and maintaining the management network are less proportionally than in a 
small network. Out-of-band management is a part of the Enterprise Composite Network Model and 
SAFE as applied to large enterprises.
In-Band Management
In-band management is appropriate in smaller networks and in networks with sufﬁcient link capac-
ities to support both application trafﬁc and management activity. Securing access to the devices and 
management applications is an important consideration. Mechanisms to secure the management 
command and data stream include IPSec tunnels, SSH, and SSL.
Auto Update Security
A repeating theme throughout the discussion of the SAFE Architecture is the wide range of devices 
that are needed to secure the enterprise. That is all well and good until it is time to discuss how to 
manage all the different security devices.  
The reasons for having large quantity of security devices varies—such as the need for multiples of 
devices due to the size of the enterprise or the need to deploy several different types of security 
devices. Whatever the reason, Cisco included as part of their SAFE architecture, tools and a meth-
odology to effectively manage and maintain these systems—automatically.
This central conﬁguration management system is a part of the CiscoWorks VPN/Security Management 
Solution (VMS) suite of products. It is called the Auto Update Server Software, which allows the 
security administrator to initially conﬁgure, change and update conﬁgurations, and verify conﬁgu-
rations remotely.  
It is important to note that the central objective of CiscoWorks VMS is to tie together management 
of various security products such as the PIX Firewalls, the IDS systems, and the VPN routers. These 
systems required separate management in the past even though their functions were tightly integrated. 
With this new product, the security can be viewed holistically, thereby organizing the security 

396     Chapter 15: Common Security Flaws and Monitoring
conﬁgurations that would need to be applied to these disparate components. The CiscoWorks VMS 
product at the time of this publication is on version 2.2 and includes the following components:

This product contains the Auto Update Server at version 1.1. This type of product is ideal in today’s 
enterprise environments where security is not managed locally but from a central ofﬁce. Today, 
many companies have several small remote ofﬁces and a growing number of telecommuting users. 
This community has posed a new challenge to IT departments because they are often labor-intensive 
because you often have a single user per location. In this situation, many IT cycles can be consumed 
by a small security rule change due to the multiple devices. On a more serious note, many companies 
that cannot maintain these types of devices often resort to implementing lower security in order to 
minimize the need for change. This product enables an administrator to successfully and efﬁciently 
manage those users and still maintain a secure and robust corporate network.

Foundation Summary     397
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
The CCDA exam requires that you be familiar with the objectives of the most commonly affected 
modules in the SAFE blueprint that are targeted by security threats. 
It will be important to understand how these attacks function and which modules are commonly 
affected. This understanding will ensure that you keep current information for your design regarding 
these types of attacks.
Following is a list of the different threats and their relation to the SAFE blueprint modules.

SAFE Blueprint and the 
Security Ecosystem
Cisco developed a design guideline called SAFE. Understanding this architecture can enable 
you to develop a network with layers of security. Using layers, you can halt malicious attacks 
with different security implementations throughout the network. The essence of SAFE requires 
you to understand which parts of the network are vulnerable to speciﬁc types of attacks.  
Using SAFE can help you determine whether your security solution complies with industry best 
practices. This chapter addresses such topics.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz

SAFE Blueprint Overview     409
Foundation Topics
This chapter teaches a methodology, how you can check proposed security solutions for compliance 
with the SAFE blueprint. 
SAFE Blueprint Overview
Cisco developed a security methodology called SAFE that you can use as a guide to design and 
implement network security. It takes into account implementing products, detecting breaches, and 
employing mitigation strategies. 
SAFE is based on Cisco and partner products and uses a defense-in-depth and modular approach to 
security design. 
The SAFE blueprint that is discussed in this chapter applies to large enterprise environments. There 
are modiﬁcations to the SAFE blueprint for smaller or more specialized environments. Table 16-2 
lists the environment and the corresponding documentation that describes how to implement a 
SAFE blueprint in those environments.
Cisco describes SAFE as a defense-in-depth approach. Defense in depth means that a system has 
multiple security measures in place—in other words, layers—so that if one defense is breached, 
another is in place to prevent further damage. The concept is similar to all the booby traps that 
Indiana Jones had to get past before he could get to the treasure. 
The SAFE blueprint discourages having only one device performing a security function. It means 
that you mitigate threat throughout the network. Security capabilities can be hosted on dedicated 
appliances, such as ﬁrewalls; incorporated in the Cisco IOS on routers and switches; or running in

the background on end systems. The choice depends on the amount of activity to be monitored, 
the location of the device within the network, the threat being mitigated, and the available residual 
capacity of the existing devices. The blueprint guidelines encourage you to make security decisions 
based on the dangers to be avoided, rather than solely on security devices. Often, security devices 
that are not correctly conﬁgured are considered robust until someone breaks into them. How do you 
know which conﬁguration is going to work unless you design it against a known threat? You have 
to understand your enemy if you are going to defend against attacks from that enemy. 
Achieving the Balance
The area of network security has always projected a mysterious aura because it is commonly thought 
that a network cannot be totally secure. If absolute security is not achievable, then doesn’t the task 
of securing it seem futile? Of course, denying access to the network would secure it—but then who 
would use it?
The SAFE method clears some of the mystery behind designing and implementing a secure net-
work. It is essentially a blueprint, a guide to help network designers develop security solutions.
The essence of deﬁning network security is achieving an acceptable balance between accessibility 
and usability. The network security policy deﬁnes this balance. Before beginning a security design, 
you must have a security policy to reference. If you do not have access to one, you should create a 
policy prior to beginning a security design.
You should develop the security policy with the participation and agreement of the highest levels of 
an organization’s management. This process can help build the required support for the creation, 
acceptance, and adaptation of the security design. The process of developing a security policy is 
complex. You must tailor it to the target environment. 
NOTE
Although developing a security policy is beyond the scope of this book, it is important to 
understand the contents of the security policy. Cisco has a white paper on security-policy devel-
opment best practices at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/126/secpol.html. The network secu-
rity-policy document discusses how to identify the security needs, which underlie the security 
policy, to establish a structure for security-policy management and to respond to threats, attacks, 
and breaches. Other sources for security policy development aids appear at the following 
websites:
http://www.sans.org
http://www.cert.org

Deﬁning Customer Expectations     411
In a real-life situation, you might be required to develop a security design without a corporate policy. 
Begin by setting clear expectations. This step ensures that you write a policy that supports the 
organization’s needs and encourages the development of a security policy. It is critical to document 
these expectations prior to developing the design. 
If you encounter this type of situation, don’t be shy about taking your time to work through this 
expectation-deﬁning process. 
Deﬁning Customer Expectations
The key to establishing a secure network is to ﬁrst deﬁne what network security means to the orga-
nization. Organizations have different requirements for security. For example, a library might not 
restrict network access to the Internet, but a bank will have a much stricter policy. As a matter of 
fact, separate segments on the network can have different security requirements. If you apply the 
example of Internet access, you can imagine that a research department of a marketing company 
might have fewer restrictions to the Internet than the back ofﬁce does. 
The Cisco SAFE assumes that a security policy is already in place. You already learned that this 
policy might not exist. Remember that designing and implementing security can be challenging 
exercises. Organizations have been known to carry unrealistic expectations regarding security 
implementations and the results. Take the opportunity to discuss those expectations prior to begin-
ning a security design project. The following sections address some common customer expectations 
and misunderstandings.
Complete Security Is Not Achievable
A key expectation to set is that complete security is not achievable. Only by diligence and proactive 
maintenance can you protect a network. Often, people have an “install it and leave it” attitude with 
security systems. Unless a breach occurs, the security systems are considered to be “working.” 
Unfortunately, this type of reasoning is dangerous. New, debilitating attacks occur on a regular 
basis, so the company must adapt a proactive regime to keep the security systems robust.
Where Most Breaches Occur (or Not)
Another important expectation centers on which side of the network most threats exist. It is com-
monly accepted that network-security breaches occur inside the network. Therefore, a ﬁrewall that 
protects a network from the outside is not sufﬁcient. You need security measures that also can detect 
and reduce risks that begin on a “secured” segment.

412     Chapter 16: SAFE Blueprint and the Security Ecosystem
Discuss these expectations and others throughout the security-design phase to ensure alignment 
with the organization’s expectations. Although SAFE is not the cure-all for security issues, it can 
offer a strong defense along with sound administrative practices. Ultimately, addressing such expec-
tations provides both you and the organization with a clear vision of how to assess the existing 
network.
Design Objectives
This approach focuses on how vulnerabilities are exploited. The blueprint enables you to assess the 
existing network to understand the nature of threats and determine how to mitigate these threats. 
The following are the design objectives of the SAFE blueprint:
I
Security and attack mitigation based on policy
I
Security implementation throughout the infrastructure (not just on specialized security devices)
I
Secure management and reporting
I
Authentication and authorization of users and administrators to critical network resources
I
Intrusion detection for critical resources and subnets
I
Support for emerging networked applications
The SAFE blueprint emphasizes the deﬁning modules within a network. The ﬁrst level of modules 
are functional areas. Figure 16-1 illustrates the SAFE functional areas.

Table 16-3 shows the second layer of SAFE components. They are also deﬁned functionally. Each 
of the three functional areas has its own components or modules. The table lists these modules with 
the associated SAFE functional area.
Not all actual enterprise networks have speciﬁc devices, blades, cards, or ports clearly assigned to 
all the modules mentioned. It is still useful to the designer to identify where all the functions occur 
and the interactions between the functions. Changes in function that mark the component bound-
aries offer natural opportunities for specialization and hierarchy as a network grows. This under-
standing also assists in identifying the quality of service (QoS) and security treatments that the 
network trafﬁc might require. Figure 16-2 is an illustration of the different modules within each 
functional area.

SAFE Functional Areas and Modules
Signiﬁcance of Areas and Modules
The deﬁnition of areas or modules each with a speciﬁc function helps to layer the protection because 
there will be a different security measure in place at different points in the network. This layering 
makes the security solution more resilient and scalable. The modules, as built, become templates for 
the modiﬁcations to the network required by the addition of users and applications. Modularization 
also reduces security issues caused by growth because the security capabilities are considered in the 
module implementation.
The following are the beneﬁts of using SAFE in network design and implementation:
I
Provides a proven, detailed blueprint to securely compete in the Internet economy 
I
Provides the foundation for migrating to secure, cost-effective converged networks 
I
Enables organizations to stay within their budgets by deploying a modular, scalable security 
framework in stages

In conclusion, this modular approach allows the network designer to address the security 
relationship between the various functional blocks of the network. This approach also permits you 
to evaluate and implement security on a module-by-module basis.

The security ecosystem includes solutions from vendors of supplemental products; partners to 
provide assessment, planning, and integration capabilities; and providers of monitoring and 
management services. This web of partner-provided services and products enables the design and 
implementation of solutions that build on the capabilities of Cisco and the partners.
Essential Elements for Comprehensive Network Security
A comprehensive design for network security includes ﬁve elements, each addressed by a variety of 
products:
I
Identity—Ensure the accurate and positive identiﬁcation of network users, hosts, applications, 
services, and resources. These systems allow authorized users access only to the resources they 
are entitled to use by policy.
I
Perimeter security—Control access to critical network applications, data, and services so that 
only legitimate users and information can pass through the network. Firewalls are generally the 
ﬁrst perimeter solutions companies implement. Complementary tools include virus scanners 
and content ﬁlters. 
I
Secure connectivity—Protect conﬁdential information by implementing VPNs to establish 
private, secure communications across a public network and extend corporate networks to 
remote ofﬁces, mobile users, and partners.
I
Security monitoring—Proactively identify areas of weakness with network-vulnerability 
scanners and monitor and respond to security events as they occur with IDSs. 
I
Policy management—Specify, manage, and audit the state of a security policy.
Concentrating on these ﬁve elements in conjunction with the modular approach provides maximum 
ﬂexibility, enabling organizations to adopt the modules that are appropriate for their businesses. This 
process guarantees that the existing security infrastructure meets the network security-policy 
requirements while staying within security budgets on new e-business projects.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
The SAFE blueprint from Cisco layers security solutions based on modeling functional areas in the 
network. This type of layering implements a defense-in-depth approach. This approach ensures that 
your security systems are resilient because you have more than one security measure protecting your 
network. If one system is compromised, other security systems protect the network.
The CCDA exam requires that you be familiar with the objectives of the SAFE blueprint:
I
Security and attack mitigation based on policy
I
Security implementation throughout the infrastructure (not just on specialized security devices)
I
Secure management and reporting
I
Authentication and authorization of users and administrators to critical network resources
I
Intrusion detection for critical resources and subnets
I
Support for emerging networked applications
In addition to the SAFE objectives, the blueprint focuses on ﬁve key areas to ensure that the security 
solutions are comprehensive, all of which are critical to understanding SAFE:
I
Identity
I
Perimeter security
I
Secure connectivity
I
Security monitoring
I
Policy management
Cisco extended its ability to provide best-in-breed solutions to its customers by establishing a 
security ecosystem consisting of consulting partners, product vendors, and managed service 
providers. This partnership works to provide the full range of services needed to establish and 
maintain an enterprise’s network using the SAFE blueprint.

Foundation Topics
The “Foundation Topics” section covers traditional voice architectures, integrated voice design, and 
QoS in voice networks. The section “Traditional Voice Architectures” covers the architecture of 
time-division multiplexing (TDM) voice networks. It also discusses PSTN technologies and 
limitations.
The section “Integrated Multiservice Networks” covers IP telephony design and the Cisco 
Architecture for Voice, Video, and Integrated Data (AVVID). The section “QoS Mechanisms 
for VoIP Networks” covers the effects of QoS mechanisms in integrated networks.
Traditional Voice Architectures
This section reviews the technologies and concepts to help you understand traditional voice 
networks. 
The PSTN is the global voice network that provides voice services. The PSTN is a variety of 
networks and services that are in place worldwide; it provides a circuit-switched service using 
Signaling System 7 (SS7) for out-of-band call provisioning through the network. CO switches 
exchange SS7 messages to place and route voice calls throughout the network. The PSTN uses TDM 
facilities for calls within the network. From the CO to the customer premises, the call can be analog, 
ISDN, or TDM digital. Each call consumes 64 Kbps of bandwidth, called a digital service zero (DS0).
Local Loop and Trunks
Depending on the dialed digits, a call will route through the local loop, one or more trunks, and the 
destination local loop to reach the destination phone. The local loop is the pair of wires that runs 
from the CO to the home or business ofﬁce. 
Trunks connect two switches. The type of trunk depends on the function of the switches the trunk 
is connecting. Tie-line is frequently used to describe a dedicated line connecting two telephone 
switches within a single organization. Another name for trunk is tie-line. The following is a list of 
trunk types:
I
Interofﬁce trunk—Connects two CO switches
I
Tandem trunks—Connects central ofﬁces within a geographical area
I
Toll-connecting trunk—Connects the CO to the long-distance ofﬁce
I
Intertoll trunk—Connects two long-distance ofﬁces
I
Private trunk—Connects two privately owned switches

426     Chapter 17: Traditional Voice Architectures and Integrated Voice Design
Figure 17-1 shows an example of the PSTN. All phones connect to their local CO via the local loop. 
Calls between Phones 1 and 2 and between Phones 4 and 5 go through interofﬁce trunks. Calls 
between Phones 2 and 3 go through tandem trunks within a region. When you place calls between 
Texas and Massachusetts, calls are forwarded to the long-distance tool provider via a toll-connecting 
trunk and are routed through intertoll trunks.
Figure 17-1
Local Loops and Trunks
Ports
You can use several ports to connect to voice end stations (phones) and private voice switches:
I
Foreign Exchange Station (FXS)—Connects to an end device such as an analog phone or fax 
machine; it provides dial tone and ring voltage. 
I
Foreign Exchange Ofﬁce (FXO)—Connects to the PSTN. It is an RJ-11 connector that allows 
an analog connection to be directed at the PSTN’s central ofﬁce or to a station interface on a 
PBX. The FXO sits on the switch end of the connection. It plugs directly into the line side of 
the switch so the switch thinks the FXO interface is a telephone. 
I
Ear and mouth (E&M)—Connects private switches. It is an analog trunk used to connect to a 
voice switch; it supports tie-line facilities or signaling between phone switches. E&M can be 
connected with 2-wire and 4-wire. E&M is also known as Earth and Magnet.

Channelized T1 (or E1)—Commonly used as a digital trunk line to connect to a phone switch 
where each DS0 supports an active phone call connection. Provides 24 (for T1) or 30 (for E1) 
channels or DS0 for voice calls.
I
ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI)—Digital trunk link used to connect to a phone switch. 
A separate channel is used for common channel-signaling messages.
Major Analog and Digital Signaling Types
The signaling type depends on the type of connection. The ﬁve major areas are
I
CO to phone (loop and ground start)
I
PBX to PBX (E&M)
I
T1/E1 Channel Associated Signaling (CAS)
I
ISDN PRI Common Channel Signaling (CCS)
I
SS7 Interswitch PSTN signaling
Loop-Start Signaling
Loop-start signaling is an analog signaling technique used to indicate on-hook and off-hook 
conditions on the network. It is commonly used between the telephone set and the CO, PBX, or FXS 
module. As shown in Figure 17-2, with loop-start the local loop is open when the phone is on-hook. 
When the phone is taken off-hook, a –48 direct current (DC) voltage loops from the CO through the 
phone and back.

Ground-Start Signaling
Ground-start signaling is an analog signaling technique used to indicate on-hook and off-hook 
conditions. Ground-start is commonly used in switch-to-switch connections. The difference 
between ground-start and loop-start is that ground-start requires the closing of the loop at both 
locations. The standard way to transport voice between two telephone sets is to use tip and ring lines. 
Tip and ring lines are the twisted pair of wires that connect to your phone via an RJ-11 connector. 
As shown in Figure 17-3, the CO switch grounds the tip line. The PBX detects that the tip line is 
grounded and closes the loop by removing ground from the ring line.
Figure 17-3
Ground-Start Signaling
E&M Signaling
E&M analog signaling is most often used in PBX to PBX tie-lines. Cisco routers support four E&M 
signal types: Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type V. Type I and II are most popular on the American 
continents. Type V is used in the United States and Europe. There are also three forms of E&M dial-
supervision signaling to seize the E&M trunk:

I
Immediate start—This is the most basic protocol. In this technique, the originating switch 
goes off-hook, waits for a ﬁnite period of time (for example, 200 ms), and then sends the dial 
digits without regard to the far end. 
I
Wink start—Wink is the most commonly used protocol. In this technique, the originating 
switch goes off-hook, waits for a temporary off-hook pulse from the other end (which is 
interpreted as an indication to proceed), and then sends the dial digits. 
I
Delay dial—In this technique, the originating side goes off-hook and waits for about 200 ms 
and then checks whether the far end is on-hook. If the far end is on-hook, it outputs dial digits. 
If the far end is off-hook, it waits until it goes on-hook and then outputs dial digits.
T1/E1 CAS
Digital T1 CAS uses selected bits within a selected channel to transmit signaling information. CAS 
is also referred as robbed-bit signaling or in-band signaling in the T1 implementation. Robbed-bit 
CAS works with digital voice because losing an occasional voice sample does not affect the voice 
quality. The disadvantage with robbed-bit CAS is that it cannot be used on channels that might carry 
voice or data without reducing the data rate to 56 Kbps to ensure that signaling changes do not 
damage the data stream. E1, which uses a separate channel in the shared media for CAS, does not 
have this disadvantage. The E1 signaling bits are channel associated, but they are not in-band. 
ISDN PRI
ISDN T1 PRI provides 23 channels for voice with a separate channel for signaling. The ISDN E1 
PRI provides 30 channels. The use of messages in a separate channel, rather than preassigned bits, 
is also referred to as common-channel signaling. Any bit in the signaling channel is common to all 
of the channels sharing the media rather than dedicated to a particular single channel. ISDN pro-
vides the advantage of not changing bits in the channels and is thus useful for data trafﬁc in addition 
to voice trafﬁc.  
SS7
SS7 is a global ITU standard for telecommunications control that allows voice-network calls to 
be routed and controlled by call-control centers. SS7 implements call setup, routing, and control, 
ensuring that intermediate and far-end switches are available when a call is placed. With SS7, 
telephone companies are able to implement modern consumer-telephone services such as caller 
ID, toll-free numbers, call forwarding, and so on.
SS7 provides mechanisms for exchanging control, status, and routing messages on public telephone 
networks. SS7 messages pass over a separate channel than that used for voice communication. You 
use common channel signaling (CCS7) when speaking about SS7 signaling. CCS7 controls call 
signaling, routing, and connections between CO, inter-exchange carrier, and competitive local 
exchange carrier switches. Figure 17-4 shows the connectivity between SS7 components.  

430     Chapter 17: Traditional Voice Architectures and Integrated Voice Design
Figure 17-4
SS7 Signaling Components
As shown in Figure 17-4, SS7 has the following system components:
I
Signaling Control Point (SCP)—Databases that provide the necessary information for special 
call processing and routing, including 800 and 900 call services, credit-card calls, local number 
portability, cellular roaming services, and advanced call-center applications.
I
Signaling Transfer Point (STP)—Receives and routes incoming signaling messages toward 
their destinations. STPs are deployed in mated pairs and share the trafﬁc between them.
I
Signaling Switching Point (SSP)—Telephone switches equipped with SS7 software and 
signaling links. Each SSP is connected to both STPs in a mated pair.
Addressing Digit Signaling
There are two methods for submitting analog address digits to place a call:
I
Pulse or rotary dialing
I
Dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) dialing
Pulse dialing uses the opening and closing of a switch at the telephone set. A rotary register at the 
CO detects the opening and closing of the loop. When dialing the number 5 on the rotary phone, the 
dial mechanism opens and closes 5 times, each 1/10 of a second apart.

DTMF uses two tones simultaneously to indicate the dialed number. Table 17-2 shows the phone 
keypad and the frequencies used. When dialing the number 5, both frequencies 770 Hz and 1336 Hz 
are sent to the CO.
PSTN Numbering Plan
The PSTN uses the ITU E.164 standard for public network addressing. The E.164 standard uses a 
maximum of 15 digits. Examples of E.164 addresses are the residential, business, and cell phones 
that you use everyday. Each country is assigned a country code to identify it. The country codes can 
be one to three digits in length. Some examples of country codes are
I
United States of America and Canada: 1
I
Brazil: 55
I
Italy: 39
I
China: 86
I
Egypt: 20
I
India: 91
I
Germany: 49
I
Ukraine: 380
One website that lists country codes is http://www.countrycallingcodes.com/countrylist.htm.
Each country divides its network into area codes that identify a geographical region or city. The 
United States uses three digits for area codes, and other countries might use codes from one to four

digits in length. The areas are further divided into ofﬁce codes and preﬁxes. In the United States, the 
ofﬁce code is three digits, and the preﬁx is four digits in length. The preﬁx identiﬁes the phone.
An example of a PSTN address in the United States is 1-713-781-0300. The 1 identiﬁes the United 
States; the 713 identiﬁes an area code in the Houston, Texas, geographical region. The 781 identiﬁes 
a CO in west Houston. The 0300 identiﬁes the phone.
Another example of a PSTN address is 52-55-8452-1110. The country code 52 identiﬁes Mexico. 
The area code 55 identiﬁes the geographical area of Mexico City. The ofﬁce code 8452 and preﬁx 
1110 follow.
PBX Switches
PBXs are customer-owned voice switches. Enterprise companies install and conﬁgure their 
own PBXs to provide telephony service, four-digit dialing, remote-ofﬁce extensions, voicemail, and 
private-line routing within other features. Organizations can reduce toll charges by using private tie-
lines between their switches. Calls that are placed between ofﬁces through the private voice network 
are called on-net. If a user needs to place a call outside the private network, the call is routed to the 
local PSTN. If the call is forwarded to the PSTN, it is called off-net. 
Figure 17-5 shows a PBX network for an enterprise. Callers use the PBX network when they place 
calls from San Diego to Chicago, Atlanta, or Houston. The enterprise reduces toll charges by using 
its private voice network. A separate private network is in place for data trafﬁc. If a user places a call 
from San Diego to Los Angeles, it is routed out to the PSTN from the San Diego PBX. Then, toll 
charges are incurred for the call.
Another issue in the design is the limitation of the number of calls per private line. If the private lines 
are T1s, they are each limited to carrying 24 concurrent calls at a time.
Grade of Service and Erlangs
You must consider voice trafﬁc requirements when designing a network. Grade of service and 
erlangs are two parameters used in the design of voice networks.
Grade of Service
Grade of service (GoS) is the probability of a call being blocked when attempting to seize a circuit. 
If a network deﬁnes P.02 GoS, the probability is that two percent of all attempted calls will be 
blocked.

Traditional Voice Architectures     433
Figure 17-5
PBX Network
Erlangs
An erlang is a unit of telecommunications trafﬁc measurement representing the continuous use of 
one voice path for one hour. It describes the total trafﬁc volume of one hour. Erlangs determine 
voice-call usage for bandwidth requirements for voice network designs, including VoIP.
If a group of users makes 20 calls in an hour and each call lasts 10 minutes, the erlangs are calculated 
as follows:
20 calls/hour * 10 minutes/call = 200 minutes/hour
Trafﬁc volume = (200 min/hour) / (60 minutes/hour) 
= 3.33 erlangs

Other PSTN Services
The PSTN provides a suite of services in addition to just call setup and routing. Other PSTN services 
include
I
Centrex
I
Voicemail
I
Database services
I
Interactive voice response (IVR)
I
Automatic call distribution (ACD)
Centrex Services
Companies can use the local phone company to handle all of their internal and external calls from 
the CO. In this voice model, the CO acts as the company’s voice switch with PBX features such as 
four-digit extension dialing, voicemail, and call holds and transfers. The Centrex service gives the 
company the appearance of having its own PBX network.
Voicemail
PSTN service providers can enable voice messaging for those customers requesting the service. 
Voicemail provides automated call answering and message recording. Users can then retrieve the 
message and forward it to other extensions.
Database Services
The PSTN must keep call detail records (CDR) in the database systems. CDR information includes 
all types of call information, such as called party, caller, time, duration, locations, and user service 
plans. This information is used for billing and reporting.
IVR
IVR systems connect incoming calls to an audio playback system that queues the calls, provides pre-
recorded announcements, prompts the caller for key options, provides the caller with information, 
and transfers the call to another switch extension or agent. IVR is used in call centers run by ﬁnan-
cial, retail, and transportation companies to gather and provide information for the customers before 
transferring them to agents.

Integrated Multiservice Networks     435
ACD
ACD routes calls to a group of agents. ACD keeps statistics on each agent, such as the number of 
calls and their duration. Based on the statistics, the ACD system then can evenly distribute the calls 
to the agents or to the appropriate agent skill group. ACD is used by airline reservation systems, 
customer service departments, and other call centers.
Integrated Multiservice Networks
The introduction of packet-voice technology allows the convergence of data and voice networks—
which lets companies save toll charges on voice telephone calls and reduce their total cost of 
ownership by not having to build and operate separate networks for voice, video, and data. 
In multiservice networks, digitized (coded) voice is packaged into packets, cells, or frames; sent as 
data throughout the networks; and converted back to analog voice. The underlying protocols used 
for these converged services are 
I
Voice over Frame Relay (VoFR)
I
Voice over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (VoATM)
I
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
Of these, VoIP, also referenced as IP telephony when integrated with IP-based signaling and call 
control, is how almost all new deployments are being implemented.
VoFR
VoFR permits enterprise customers with existing Frame Relay networks to implement packetized 
voice. Access devices or cards access the Frame Relay network. PBX vendors provide VoFR cards 
for their switches to support call routing over the Frame Relay network. Figure 17-6 shows an 
example of three PBXs connected with trunks using VoFR. The PSTN is used for backup if the 
Frame Relay circuit goes down. The disadvantage with VoFR is that it provides only convergence 
in the WAN; it still requires local dedicated telephony equipment and networks. It cannot provide 
convergence to LANs without a network protocol that can span the data link technologies, such 
as IP.
One standard for VoFR is Frame Relay Forum (FRF) 11.1. It establishes speciﬁcations for call setup, 
coding types, and packet formats for VoFR service. It provides the basis for interoperability between 
vendors.

VoFR Trunks Between PBXs
A number of mechanisms can minimize delay and the variable delay (jitter) on a Frame Relay 
network. The presence of long data frames on a low-speed Frame Relay link can cause unacceptable 
delays for time-sensitive voice frames. To reduce this problem, some vendors implement smaller 
frame sizes to help reduce delay and delay variation. FRF.12 is an industry-standard approach to 
doing this, so products from different vendors can interoperate and consumers will know what type 
of voice quality to expect. To ensure voice quality, you should set the committed information rate 
(CIR) of each permanent virtual circuit (PVC) to ensure that voice frames are not discarded.
VoATM
VoATM permits enterprise customers to use their existing ATM networks for voice trafﬁc. ATM 
inherently provides guaranteed QoS for voice trafﬁc that IP protocols alone cannot provide. ATM can 
provide the service levels and functionality required to support voice trafﬁc for the WAN. For those 
enterprise networks with ATM, VoATM provides a mechanism to connect enterprise PBXs via ATM 
and other VoATM applications. 
With ATM, constant bit rate (CBR) or variable bit rate-real time (VBR-rt) classes of service (CoSs) 
provide levels of bandwidth and delay guarantees for voice. Chapter 5, “Wide-Area Networking 
Technologies,” covers ATM.

PBX vendors provide VoATM cards for their switches to support call routing over the Frame Relay 
network. Figure 17-7 shows an example of three PBXs that are connected via trunks using VoATM. 
The PSTN is used for backup if the ATM circuit goes down. As with VoFR, the disadvantage with 
VoATM is that it provides only convergence in the WAN. It cannot provide convergence within the 
LAN without a network protocol that can span the data link technologies, such as IP.

VoIP Introduction
VoIP provides transport of voice over the IP protocol family. IP makes voice globally available 
regardless of the data link (Ethernet, ATM, Frame Relay) protocol in use. With VoIP, enterprises do 
not have to build separate voice and data networks. Integrating voice and data into a single con-
verged network reduces the costs of owning and managing separate networks. 
Figure 17-8 shows a company that has separate voice and data networks. Phones connect to local 
PBXs, and the PBXs are connected using TDM trunks. Off-net calls are routed to the PSTN. The 
data network uses LAN switches connected to WAN routers. The WAN for data uses Frame Relay. 
Separate operations and management systems are required for these networks.

call processing with gateway routers. Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) is used for failover 
or backup to the PSTN if there is a WAN failure. On-net calls travel through the Frame Relay 
network and off-net calls are forwarded to the PSTN.

The Cisco Call Manager (CM) fulﬁlls the role of call processing. The CM servers have the “brains” 
of the voice dial plan.
Service applications include IVR, Unity Uniﬁed Messaging System for voicemail, and Intelligent 
Contact Management (ICM) for allowing the enterprise to better control contact routing to call 
centers. There is also a standards-based Telephony Application Program Interface (TAPI) interface.
The infrastructure includes QoS-enabled devices such as L2 switches, L3 switches, and routers.
AVVID Deployment Models
This subsection covers the three AVVID call-processing deployment models. The deployment 
models are
I
Single-site deployment
I
Centralized WAN call processing
I
Distributed WAN call processing
Single-Site Deployment
The single-site deployment model is a solution for enterprises located in a single large building or 
campus area with no voice on the WAN links. Figure 17-11 shows the single-site model. A single 
CM cluster is deployed for redundancy in the server farm, and Unity is used for uniﬁed messaging. 
IP phones are deployed from the LAN switches. CM Version 3.3 supports up to 30,000 users in a 
cluster. You can conﬁgure high-end switches with gateway cards for access to the PSTN for off-net 
calls.
Centralized WAN Call-Processing Model
The centralized WAN call-processing model is a solution for medium enterprises with one large 
location and many remote sites. Figure 17-12 shows the centralized call-processing model. A CM 
cluster with multiple servers is deployed for redundancy at the large site. Remote sites use voice-
enabled gateways or routers with SRST for redundancy. In the event of WAN failure, SRST-
conﬁgured routers forward calls through the PSTN. With CM 3.3, each CM supports up to 7500 
users. In this model, admission control is conﬁgured on the CM to impose a limit on the number of 
calls permitted per site.

Distributed WAN Call-Processing Model
The distributed WAN call-processing model is a solution for large enterprises with several large 
locations. Figure 17-13 shows the distributed WAN model. Up to 30,000 users are supported per CM 
cluster with CM Version 3.3. Several CM clusters are deployed at the large sites for redundancy and 
Unity servers for messaging. Intercluster trucks establish communication between clusters. IP 
phones are deployed on LAN switches.

Centralized WAN CM Deployment Model
This model also supports remote sites distributed off the large sites. Admission control between 
the CM and Cisco IOS gateway with gatekeeper (GK) is supported. The Cisco IOS Gatekeeper is 
required for admission control. Also, this model supports multiple WAN codecs. Compression of 
VoIP is done between sites.
Codecs
Speech is an analog signal. Speech must be converted into digital signals for transmission over 
digital systems. The ﬁrst basic modulation and coding technique was Pulse Code Modulation 
(PCM). The international standard for PCM is G.711. With PCM, analog speech is sampled 8000 
times a second. Each speech sample is mapped onto 8 bits. Thus, PCM produces (8000 samples/
second) * (8 bits/sample) = 64,000 bits/second = 64 Kbps coded bit rate. Other coding schemes have 
been developed to further compress the data representation of speech. Most voice compression 
codes, like G.729, begin with a G.711-coded voice stream.

Codec Standards
Codecs transform analog signals into a digital bit stream and digital signals back into analog signals. 
Figure 17-14 shows that an analog signal is digitized with a coder for digital transport. The decoder 
converts the digital signal into analog form. 
Figure 17-14
Codec
Each codec provides a certain quality of speech. A measure used to describe the quality of speech 
is the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). With MOS, a large group of listeners judges the quality of 
speech from 5 (best) to 1 (bad). The scores are then averaged out to provide the MOS score for each 
sample. G.711 has a MOS score of 4.1 and G.729 has a MOS score of 3.92. The default codec setting 
for VoIP dial peers in Cisco IOS Software is G.729 (g729r8). Some other codec standards appear in 
Table 17-3. An explanation of the compression techniques is beyond the scope of the CCDA test.

VoIP Control and Transport Protocols
You use a number of protocols to set up IP telephony clients, calls, and the transport of voice 
packets. Some of the most signiﬁcant protocols are
I
Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)—To establish IP conﬁguration parameters
I
Domain Name System (DNS)—To obtain IP addresses of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol 
(TFTP) server
I
TFTP—To obtain conﬁgurations
I
Skinny Station Control Protocol (SSCP)—For call establishment
I
RTP—For voice stream (VoIP) station-to-station trafﬁc in an ongoing call
I
RTCP—For call control
I
Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)—For call establishment with gateways
I
H.323—For call establishment with gateways from the ITU
I
SIP—For call establishment with gateways, deﬁned by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
DHCP, DNS, and TFTP
IP phones use DHCP to obtain their IP addressing information: IP address, mask, and default gate-
way. DHCP also provides the IP address of the DNS server and the name or IP address of the TFTP 
server. You use TFTP to download the phone operating system and conﬁguration. Both DHCP and 
TFTP run over UDP.

SSCP
SSCP is a Cisco proprietary signaling protocol for call setup and control. SSCP runs over TCP. SSCP 
is referred to as a “skinny” protocol because it uses less overhead than the call-setup protocols used 
by H.323.
RTP and RTCP
In VoIP, RTP transports audio streams. RTP is a transport layer protocol that carries digitized voice 
in its payload. RTP is deﬁned in RFC 1889. RTP runs over UDP, which has a lower delay than TCP. 
Because of the time sensitivity of voice trafﬁc and the delay incurred in retransmissions, UDP is used 
instead of TCP. Real-time trafﬁc is carried over UDP ports ranging from 16,384 to 16,624. The only 
requirement is that the RTP data is transported on an even port and that RTCP is carried on the 
next odd port. RTCP is also deﬁned in RFC 1889. RTCP is a session layer protocol that monitors 
the delivery of data and provides control and identiﬁcation functions. Figure 17-15 shows a VoIP 
packet with the IP, UDP, and RTP headers. Notice that the sum of the header lengths is 20 + 8 + 
12 = 40 bytes.
Figure 17-15
IP, UDP, and RTP Headers of a VoIP Packet
WAN links use RTP header compression to reduce the size of voice packets. It is also referred as 
Compressed RTP (CRTP). As shown in Figure 17-16, CRTP reduces the IP/UDP/RTP header from 
40 bytes to 2 or 4 bytes in length—a signiﬁcant decrease in overhead. CRTP happens on a hop-by-
hop basis with compression and decompression occurring on every link. It must be conﬁgured on 
both ends of the link.

MGCP
MGCP is a gateway protocol used for controlling gateways in VoIP networks. MGCP is deﬁned by 
the IETF’s RFC 2705. MGCP’s primary function is to control and supervise connection attempts 
between different media gateways.
H.323
H.323 is a standard published by the ITU that works as a framework document for multimedia 
protocols that include voice, video, and data conferencing for use over packet-switched networks. 
H.323 describes terminals and other entities (such as gatekeepers) to provide multimedia 
applications. Cisco IOS gateways use H.323 to communicate with the Cisco CM.
H.323 includes the following elements:
I
Terminals—Telephones, video phones, and voicemail systems
I
Multipoint Control Units (MCU)—Responsible for managing multipoint conferences
I
Gateways—Composed of a media gateway controller for call signaling and a media gateway 
to handle media
I
Gatekeeper—Optional component used for admission control and address resolution
H.323 terminals must support the following standards:
I
H.245
I
Q.931
I
H.225
I
RTP/RTCP
H.245 speciﬁes messages for opening and closing channels for media streams and other commands, 
requests, and indications. It is a conferencing control protocol.
Q.931 is a standard for call signaling used within the context of H.225 by H.323.
H.225 speciﬁes messages for call control, including signaling between endpoints, registration and 
admissions, and packetization and synchronization of media streams.
RTP is the transport layer protocol used to transport VoIP packets. RCTP is a session layer protocol.
H.323 includes a series of protocols for multimedia that are listed in Table 17-4.

Integrated Multiservice Networks     447
SIP
SIP is a protocol deﬁned by the IETF and speciﬁed in RFC 2543. It is an alternative multimedia 
framework to H.323, developed speciﬁcally for IP telephony. Cisco is now supporting SIP protocol 
on its phones and gateways. 
SIP is an application layer control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating 
Internet multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls, and multimedia distribution. Communi-
cation between members in a session can be via a multicast, a unicast mesh, or a combination.
SIP is designed as part of the overall IETF multimedia data and control architecture that 
incorporates protocols such as the following:
I
Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) (RFC 2205) for reserving network resources
I
RTP (RFC 1889) for transporting real-time data and providing QoS feedback
I
Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) (RFC 2326) for controlling delivery of streaming media
I
Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) (RFC 2974) for advertising multimedia sessions via 
multicast
I
Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 2327) for describing multimedia sessions
SIP supports user mobility by using proxy and redirect servers to redirect requests to the user’s 
current location. Users can register their current locations, and SIP location services provide the 
location of user agents.

Voice Design Issues
VoIP calls need to meet bandwidth and delay parameters. The amount of bandwidth required 
depends on the codec used, the Layer 2 protocols, and whether VAD is enabled. For the purpose of 
call control, you can use the following bandwidth requirements for VoIP design:
I
G.729 calls use 24 Kbps 
I
G.723 calls use 24 Kbps
I
G.711 calls use 80 Kbps
When designing for VoIP networks, the total bandwidth for voice, data, and video should not exceed 
75 percent of the provisioned link capacity. Use the following formula to provision interface speeds:
Link capacity = [req BW for voice] + [req BW for video] + [req BW for data]
The remaining bandwidth is used by routing, multicast, and management protocols.
VAD
As we listen and pause between sentences, typical voice conversations can contain up to 60 percent 
silence in each direction. In circuit-switched telephone networks, all voice calls use ﬁxed-bandwidth, 
64 Kbps links regardless of how much of the conversation is speech and how much is silence. In 
multiservice networks, all conversation and silence is packetized. Using VAD, you can suppress 
packets of silence. Silence suppression at the source IP telephone or VoIP gateway increases the 
number of calls or data volumes that can be carried over the links, more effectively utilizing network 
bandwidth. Bandwidth savings are at least 35 percent in conservative estimates. VAD is enabled by 
default for all VoIP calls.

Integrated Multiservice Networks     449
Table 17-5 shows how much bandwidth is required based on different parameters. Notice that for 
G.729, bandwidth is reduced from 26.4 Kbps to 17.2 Kbps with VAD and to 7.3 Kbps with VAD 
and CRTP enabled.

Delay Components
The ITU’s G.114 recommendation speciﬁes that the one-way delay between endpoints should not 
exceed 150 ms to be acceptable commercial voice quality. In private networks, somewhat longer 
delays might be acceptable for economic reasons. Delay components are one of two major types: 
ﬁxed delay and variable delay. 
Fixed delay includes
I
Propagation delay
I
Processing delay
I
Serialization delay
I
De-jitter delay
Propagation delay is the time it takes for a packet to travel between two points. It is based on the 
distance between the two endpoints. You cannot overcome this delay component. The speed of light 
is the theoretical limit. A reasonable planning ﬁgure is approximately 10 ms per 1000 miles, or 6 ms 
per 1000 Km. This ﬁgure allows for media degradation and devices internal to the transport network.
Processing delay includes coding and compression delays. G.729 has a delay of 15 ms, and G.711 
PCM has a delay of 0.75 ms.
Serialization delay is the time it takes to place bits on the circuit. Faster circuits have less 
serialization delay. Serialization delay is calculated with the following formula:
Serial delay = frame size (bits)/link BW (bps)
A 1500 byte packet takes (1500 * 8 / 64,000) = 187 ms of serialization delay on a 64 Kbps circuit. 
If the circuit is increased to 512 Kbps, the serialization delay changes to (1500 * 8/512,000) = 
23.4 ms. Data-link fragmentation using Link Fragmentation and Interleaving (LFI) or FRF 12 
mechanisms reduces the serialization delay by reducing the size of the larger data packets. This 
arrangement reduces the delay experienced by voice packets as data packet fragments are serialized 
and voice packets are interleaved between the fragments. A reasonable design goal is to keep the 
serialization delay experienced by the largest packets or fragments on the order of 10 ms at any 
interface.
Packets can take different, redundant paths to reach the destination. Packets might not arrive at a 
constant rate because they take different paths and they might experience congestion in the network. 
This variable delay is called jitter. The receiving end uses de-jitter buffers to smooth out the variable 
delay of received VoIP packets. De-jitter buffers change the variable delay to ﬁxed delay.

QoS Mechanisms for VoIP Networks     451
The variable-delay component includes queuing delay. As packets cross a network, they pass 
through several devices. At every output port of these devices is the probability that other voice and 
data trafﬁc is sharing the link. Queuing delay is the delay experienced as a result of other trafﬁc 
sharing the link. It is the sum of the serialization delays of all the packets scheduled ahead of delayed 
packet. As the trafﬁc load on a network increases, both the probability of delay and the length of the 
probable delay increase. The actual queuing delay depends on the number of queues, queue lengths, 
and queue algorithms. Queuing effects in VoIP networks are covered in the next section.
QoS Mechanisms for VoIP Networks
Cisco provides different QoS tools that you should use on edge and backbone routers to support 
VoIP networks. This section covers several QoS mechanisms and their impact on VoIP networks. 
The covered QoS mechanisms are
I
CRTP
I
LFI
I
Priority Queuing (PQ)
I
WFQ
I
Priority Queue-WFQ (PQ-WFQ)
I
LLQ
I
Auto QoS
CRTP
CRTP was covered in an earlier section. It compresses the IP/UDP/RTP headers from 40 bytes to 
2/4 bytes. It is conﬁgured on a link-to-link basis. Cisco recommends using CRTP for links lower 
than 768 Kbps. Do not conﬁgure CRTP if the router CPU is above 75 percent utilization. 
LFI
LFI is a QoS mechanism used to reduce the serialization delay. In a multiservice network, small 
VoIP packets have to compete with large data trafﬁc packets for outbound interfaces. If the large data 
packet arrives at the interface ﬁrst, the VoIP packet has to wait until the large data packet is serial-
ized. When the large packet is fragmented into smaller packets, the VoIP packets can be interleaved 
in between the data packets. Figure 17-17 shows an example of how LFI works. With no LFI, all 
VoIP packets and other small packets must wait for the FTP data to be transmitted. With LFI, the 
FTP data packet is fragmented. The queuing mechanism then can interleave the VoIP packets with 
the other and send the packets out the interface.

452     Chapter 17: Traditional Voice Architectures and Integrated Voice Design
Figure 17-17
LFI
FRF.12 is a fragmentation and interleaving mechanism speciﬁc to Frame Relay networks. It is 
conﬁgured on Frame Relay PVCs to fragment large data packets into smaller packets and interleave 
them with VoIP packets. This process reduces the serialization delay caused by larger packets.
PQ
PQ uses four queues: high, medium, normal, and low. All trafﬁc assigned to the high queue is 
preferred over the trafﬁc in the other queues. Trafﬁc in lower queues might be discarded if the higher 
queues always have trafﬁc. This is why PQ is said to be a nonfair queuing scheme.
WFQ
WFQ dequeues packets based on the arrival time of the last bit rather than the ﬁrst bit, which ensures 
that applications that use large packets cannot unfairly monopolize the bandwidth. WFQ allows 
smaller ﬂows to have preferential service over larger bandwidth ﬂows. The disadvantage of WFQ 
for VoIP networks is that it does not necessary provide service guarantees or priority service to VoIP 
packets. It is the default queue service for interfaces operating at 2.048 Mbps or less.

QoS Mechanisms for VoIP Networks     453
PQ-WFQ
PQ-WFQ is also known as IP RTP priority. PQ-WFQ adds a single priority queue to WFQ. The 
priority queue is used for VoIP packets. All other trafﬁc is queued based on the WFQ algorithm. One 
variation of PQ-WFQ is Frame Relay RTP priority, which allows strict priority for RTP trafﬁc on 
Frame Relay PVCs.
With IP RTP priority, the router places VoIP RTP packets in a strict priority queue that is always 
serviced ﬁrst. All other (data) trafﬁc is serviced by WFQ. If there is no need for differentiated CoSs 
for data trafﬁc, use IP RTP priority instead of LLQ. If you require differentiated CoSs for data trafﬁc, 
use LLQ.
LLQ
LLQ is also known as Priority Queuing-Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing (PQ-CBWFQ). LLQ 
provides a single priority queue, as does PQ-WFQ, but is preferred for VoIP networks because it can 
also conﬁgure guaranteed bandwidth for different classes of trafﬁc. For example, all voice call trafﬁc 
would be assigned into the priority queue, VoIP signaling and video would be assigned into a trafﬁc 
class, FTP trafﬁc would be assigned into a low-priority trafﬁc class, and all other trafﬁc would be 
assigned to a regular class. With LLQ for Frame Relay, queues are set up on a per-PVC basis. Each 
PVC has a PQ to support voice trafﬁc. This congestion-management method is considered the most 
optimal for voice.
If multiple classes are conﬁgured for LLQ, they share a single queue but are allocated bandwidth 
and policed individually. It is recommended that you place only voice in the priority queue because 
voice trafﬁc is typically well behaved, requiring ﬁxed maximum amounts of bandwidth per call. 
Introducing video or other variable-rate real-time or nonreal-time trafﬁc types could cause 
unacceptable jitter for the voice trafﬁc.
Auto QoS
Auto QoS is a recent Cisco IOS feature that uses a simpler command line interface (CLI) to enable 
QoS for VoIP in WAN and LAN environments. Auto QoS signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of 
conﬁguration lines necessary to support VoIP in the network.
For the WAN, Auto QoS provides the following capabilities:
I
Automatically classiﬁes RTP and VoIP control packets
I
Builds VoIP Modular QoS in the Cisco IOS Software
I
Provides LLQ for VoIP bearer trafﬁc
I
Provides minimum bandwidth guarantees by using CBWFQ for VoIP control trafﬁc
I
Enables WAN trafﬁc shaping, where required
I
Enables LFI and RTP, where required

454     Chapter 17: Traditional Voice Architectures and Integrated Voice Design
For the LAN, Auto QoS provides the following capabilities:
I
Enforces a trust boundary at the Cisco IP Phone
I
Enforces a trust boundary on the Catalyst switch access and uplink and downlink ports
I
Enables strict priority queuing and weighted round robin for voice and data trafﬁc
I
Modiﬁes queue admission criteria by performing CoS to queue mapping
I
Modiﬁes queue sizes, as well as queue weights where required
I
Modiﬁes CoS to DSCP and IP Precedence to DSCP mappings
AutoQoS is beneﬁcial for small-to-medium size businesses that need to deploy IPT quickly but lack 
the experience and stafﬁng to plan and deploy IP QoS services.
Auto QoS also beneﬁts large customer enterprises that need to deploy Cisco AVVID on a large scale, 
while reducing the costs, complexity, and timeframe for deployment and ensuring that the 
appropriate QoS for voice applications is being set in a consistent fashion.

This chapter is an introduction to the following network-management protocols: Simple 
Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), and Remote 
Monitoring Protocol (RMON). This chapter is by no means a detailed discussion of each 
protocol or how to conﬁgure it on Cisco equipment. Instead, the chapter introduces them so that 
a network designer can understand how they function. An awareness of the functionality allows 
the network designer to accommodate the requirements of these protocols in a network design.

Foundation Topics
Whether you are going to build a network from scratch or update an existing system, taking the time 
to assess your network-management architecture is a wise approach. Network management is an 
essential service in any network, but it is also a complex task requiring planning and design to ensure 
the integration of the management system with the network.
This chapter reviews selected low-level protocols upon which useful network-management tools 
have been built. Chapter 19, “Network Management Functionality,” explains all ﬁve functional 
areas of network management used in high-level functional models such as Fault-management, 
Conﬁguration, Accounting, Performance and Security FCAPS and operation, administration, 
maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P). Additionally, that chapter explains the service levels that 
are managed in modern networks and that represent the most comprehensive management solution. 
The goal of each protocol section is to provide an overview of the functionality. 
A Sample Roadmap to Network Management
For an organization to navigate its way through maintaining day-to-day systems and network 
availability, it must ﬁrst chart a course. As separate disciplines, both network management and 
systems management can be complex to deploy, conﬁgure, understand, and administer. This 
roadmap illustrates the key areas that address issues faced by the organizations that rely heavily 
on the network and systems infrastructure to complete their daily activities.
Looking at the bigger picture, you can group together the network, systems, and service-
management areas as enterprise management. 
Organizations require the management tools and processes that give them the ability to monitor a 
network infrastructure. The network-management server (NMS) must know all the devices on the 
network to provide an “enterprise view.” This view displays overall availability status for all network 
devices—routers, access servers, switches, and authentication, ﬁle, application, and print servers. 
From this layer, the NMS can conduct periodic status polls of network elements as well as rediscover 
the network at certain intervals to ensure information is up-to-date on the existence of network 
elements and their locations. A network node manager (NNM), such as Hewlett-Packard OpenView 
(HPOV), also provides a good overall network-management backup for all devices, should any or 
all of the other element managers become unavailable. Custom network-management applications 
can provide real-time and historical availability information for network elements using SNMP and 
access to generic data points to monitor server and network equipment.

A Sample Roadmap to Network Management     467
You perform WAN and LAN element management by conﬁguring and using a central NMS. As is 
the case for most element-management solutions, the vendor’s own management product is best 
suited for the particular management requirements pertaining to network hardware. The major 
reasons are three-fold:
I
In-depth product knowledge of the desirable features and requirements for managing the 
various equipment types
I
Provision and access to the vendor’s enterprise MIBs 
I
Consolidated technical support and access to caveat information about known implementation 
issues
With the move to a more robust and “self-healing” network-management model, collection domains 
are the key to distributing the network-management workload. Collection domains divide the event-
collection and polling activities between two logical groups that can, as near as possible, share the 
load evenly. The logical groups can be by function, geographical area, time zone, machine type, 
or any one of many other factors. Figure 18-1 illustrates a sample logical diagram of the network 
design.

Remember that you should deploy network management, like other network services, using sound 
security practices. Cisco wrote the SAFE blueprint, in which it describes how you should secure 
management trafﬁc. The diagram in Figure 18-2 illustrates separating network-management activity 
into its own modules. For a detailed design, read the white paper “SAFE: A Security Blueprint for 
Enterprise Networks,” http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/so/cuso/epso/sqfr/safe_wp.pdf.
Figure 18-2
Separating Network-Management Activity
Consider all the elements, the technical, and the process-oriented and human factors that are 
involved in achieving your network-management goals. Then, imagine building that system without 
considering the role, functionality, or relationship of the different elements involved before placing 
them in the network. Imagine you are designing a management system with elements that will be 
replicated at many locations. Can you afford to replicate a mistake? Think of the assessment of the 
network-management architecture as a time when you can work out logical issues with the design 
and make sure your design meets all your objectives. The assessment focuses on identifying 
functions and their relationships and provides the basis for later design activities. 
Evaluate the capabilities during the assessment before you select speciﬁc devices or products 
because they set the requirements that drive later choices of technology and product. Product 
selection is part of the design phase. Although some have built systems without these considerations, 
the systems tended to fall short of scalability, security, robustness, or performance expectations.

SNMP     469
Identifying network-management solutions requires understanding the network lifecycle. This cycle 
is an ongoing process of planning, designing, deploying, implementing, optimizing, and operating 
networks.
You can use several mechanisms to establish the connections of the network-management compo-
nents within a network. You use SNMP to exchange information between devices and CDP and 
RMON to monitor the function of remote devices. 
SNMP
SNMP supports systems that provide a wide range of functions within the network. SNMP works 
by using a management and agent model that uses minimal transfer of data; therefore, the agent is 
very “light,” and most of the manager functionality resides on the NMS. The manager applications 
use SNMP to communicate with the agent software running on the network devices.
Data is passed between an agent and a manager using specially deﬁned SNMP protocol data units 
(PDUs). You can use SNMP to perform conﬁgurations and collect statistics and performance 
information to manage security and monitor network devices.
SNMP Components
Cisco describes three network-management components: the managed device, the agent that resides 
in the managed device, and the management server that collects the information. The agent commu-
nicates with the management server. The agent packages locally collected management data for 
transmission to the manager using SNMP. The information collected is device and interface speciﬁc.
SNMP MIB
SNMP-compliant devices access remotely stored data using a logical structure called the MIB. 
Organized as a hierarchical tree, the MIB includes data deﬁned by standard or RFC and proprietary 
data in separate branches. The MIB provides a common structure of deﬁnitions used to request, 
locate, and transmit network-management–related data. Network and end-system equipment man-
ufacturers decide which data they make available through SNMP. Each participating vendor manages 
a private branch of the MIB tree. The Internet portion of the MIB tree, including vendor private 
branches, is managed by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA).
Each individual manageable feature in the MIB is referred to as an MIB variable. The descriptions 
of these manageable features, located within an agent, are deﬁned in a document called an MIB 
module. The MIB modules are written in a language called ASN.1. MIB module ﬁles are then loaded 
into the NMS. The primary purpose of the MIB module is to provide a name and description for 
each of the manageable features a particular agent knows about. 

470     Chapter 18: Network Management Technologies
SNMP Commands
SNMP is fundamentally a request-response architecture. The manager issues requests from the 
NMS to get data values from agents or set control values on agents, and the agent responds with data 
or conﬁrmation. Additionally, SNMP allows agents to generate unsolicited reports, known as traps, 
when some predeﬁned event occurs. Most frequently, the event involves crossing some threshold 
value. Basically, the three commands used in SNMP are get, set and trap.
SNMP Design Constraints
The indiscriminate use of SNMP can have an adverse effect on network performance. The messages 
consume link bandwidth, and the formatting of the responses consumes internal CPU and memory 
resources on the target network devices. The timeliness of event notiﬁcation and reporting granularity 
are network-management design decisions that can affect the infrastructure equipment and 
bandwidth required in a network.
SNMP References
SNMP is Internet Standard 62. RFC 3411 through RFC 3418, issued in December 2002, deﬁne the 
current standard. Other current Internet standards related to SNMP include Internet Standard 15; 
the original deﬁnition of SNMP in RFC 1157; and Internet Standard 50, which addresses managed 
objects for Ethernet-like interface types.
SNMP Evolution
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has deﬁned three versions of SNMP over the years. 
SNMPv2 extended SNMP to function over networks other than IP networks, such as Novell’s 
Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX). SNMPv3 retains the data deﬁnition language, ASN.1; MIBs; 
and protocol operations from SNMPv2 and adds more rigorous security and administration. 
Additionally, SNMPv3 is deﬁned in a modular fashion to allow the evolution of various protocol 
formats and operations at different times.
For more detailed information on SNMP, refer to the relevant RFCs in Table 18-2. 
TIP
Table 18-2 is not the complete list of SNMP-relevant RFCs; however, these RFCs are the 
most pertinent.

CDP     471
CDP
Cisco developed a proprietary protocol called CDP that informs other devices of their presence on 
the network as well as receives information of neighboring devices. 
CDP Components
Whereas SNMP is fundamentally a request-response architecture, CDP is a “hello-based” protocol, 
and all devices running CDP periodically advertise their attributes to their neighbors. CDP uses a 
multicast address to send and receive these advertisements. CDP works at the data link layer, which

limits its direct reach to logically adjacent devices. All Cisco infrastructure equipment is CDP 
compliant. You can use only this protocol to map a network by moving from node to node.
CDP Advantages
Some network-management protocols are limited in multiprotocol environments. Because CDP is 
independent of any network-layer protocol, two devices that do not have a common network-layer 
protocol can discover each other. This ability extends connectivity in multiprotocol environments.
CDP Considerations and Constraints
When you use CDP to map a network by moving from node to node, it is a bit chatty. Continuous 
use of CDP over low-bandwidth connections can result in starving application trafﬁc, and you must 
take care when enabling CDP in the network. CDP is enabled automatically upon system startup; 
however, you must explicitly conﬁgure all interfaces that need to run CDP.
RMON
RFC 2819 (formerly RFC 1757, formerly RFC 1271) describes speciﬁcations for RMON, which 
is an MIB agent that deﬁnes functions for remotely monitoring networked devices. This ability to 
perform remote management increases the usability of SNMP. RMON-compliant managers and 
network probes can exchange numerous monitoring, problem detection, and reporting capabilities.
A typical RMON architecture consists of a central NMS and a remote-monitoring capability, which 
can be a separate device called an RMON probe. The NMS is a network-management station 
running RMON-capable software. The RMON NMS host can be a dedicated workstation, usually 
running UNIX or Microsoft Windows, or a blade installed in a central network device. From the 
management station, you can issue SNMP commands requesting information from the RMON 
probe. 

Foundation Summary     473
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
The three versions of SNMP use essentially the same architecture of management and agent 
components. PDUs pass information from agent to management. CDP is a Cisco protocol on all 
Cisco devices that advertises and discovers neighboring devices. RMON is an MIB structure that 
enables the remote management of devices.
The CCDA exam requires that you know and understand the three versions of SNMP described in 
this chapter. Understand that network management is an essential service in any network but that it 
is a complex task requiring planning and design to ensure the integration of the management system 
with the network. You should also understand the low-level protocols described in this chapter.

Network Management 
Functionality
This chapter explains a model for deﬁning the network management functionality called 
FCAPS, which stands for fault, conﬁguration, accounting, performance, and security manage-
ment. The FCAPS network management model standardized by the International Telecommu-
nication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) in Recommendation X.700 
is a common basis for developing a comprehensive network management system.
This chapter focuses on identifying the different components of FCAPS and describing some 
common functions of the different components. Understanding the FCAPS functional model 
can help you determine the completeness of a network management design. 
This chapter also discusses service levels and how to manage them. Service levels are important 
to understand so you can assess managed network services such as network monitoring. 
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you need to 
read the entire chapter. If you intend to read the entire chapter, you do not necessarily need 
to answer these questions now.
The 10-question quiz, derived from the major sections in the “Foundation Topics” portion of the 
chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.

Fault Management     481
Foundations Topics
The ITU-T deﬁnes ﬁve functions expected from the process of network management. You can 
remember these processes with FCAPS (fault, conﬁguration, accounting, performance, security), 
each of which is described in this section. These functions represent a comprehensive network-
management service. You can use FCAPS to determine the effectiveness of network management 
based on an assessment of how well the network-management system delivers each of these 
components. Practically every network-management activity ﬁts into one of these functional areas.
This section also addresses service levels because Internet access and connectivity provided by 
service providers are critical to customer’s business operations and needs.
Fault Management
When you think about network management, fault management usually comes to mind ﬁrst. Fault 
management refers to detecting, isolating, and correcting problems (faults) on the network to ensure 
good network performance. Fault management does not have to reside on a network-management 
device; fault management is also a function of Cisco IOS Software. 
After you identify or discover a fault, you use troubleshooting methods to isolate the network fault 
and then correct the problem. For fault management on Cisco IOS Software, you can use system 
monitoring commands such as show and debug to discover the network problem, system test 
commands to deﬁne the network problem, and conﬁguration commands to resolve them. 
Cisco recommends using the following activities for basic fault management for Cisco IOS devices:
I
Displaying system information using show commands
I
Testing network connectivity 
I
Testing memory and interfaces 
I
Logging system error messages 
I
Using ﬁeld diagnostics on line cards 
I
Troubleshooting speciﬁc line cards 
I
Storing line-card crash information 
I
Creating core dumps 
I
Enabling debug operations 
I
Enabling conditionally triggered debugging 
I
Using the environmental monitor

482     Chapter 19: Network Management Functionality
HP OpenView and Tivoli from IBM are common examples of fault-reporting network-management 
stations. A network-management station identiﬁes faults and facilitates the management of multiple 
devices. Fault events are reported to the station via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
traps or regular interval polling by the management station. You can conﬁgure the station to pop a 
window or to send an e-mail or page to network analysts. Fault management is the most common 
element of FCAPS. 
Conﬁguration Management
Conﬁguration management refers to baselining, modifying, and tracking conﬁguration changes to 
network devices. This function also tracks versions of operating systems on the devices. You can use 
conﬁguration management to gather inventory information instead of going to each device one-by-
one. It is also helpful to track changes made to devices when there is more than one administrator 
with network-management responsibilities. 
Just imagine how much easier it is to manage multiple devices and to view the conﬁguration of those 
devices holistically with one network-management station. The ability to view multiple conﬁgura-
tions often accompanies the ability to make template conﬁguration changes. This ability is useful in 
complex environments that incorporate large amounts of redundancy or in environments where sev-
eral devices perform the same function.
In case the conﬁgurations on the devices go awry, conﬁguration management can save versions 
of conﬁgurations and push those conﬁgurations back on to systems. Conﬁguration management 
systems, with all the stored information as well as a history of changes, can be useful in trouble-
shooting. This system is a way to manage windows of opportunity for conﬁguration changes; when 
you face short timeframes, you can always fall back to a known working conﬁguration.
Accounting Management
Accounting management refers to tracking the usage of network segments to determine usage-based 
billing for services. This management allows IT departments to bill and manage the needs of speciﬁc 
departments based on their usage. It can reduce network-resource issues because the departments 
that use the most services are billed accordingly.
To begin the accounting process, you must make a baseline to identify the resources to be tracked 
and to measure the current utilization. This way, the network administrations can analyze the data 
to determine the current usage patters of important network services. Based on this analysis, they 
can determine how to “charge” or manage the utilization. 
Converged networks increase the bandwidth requirements for the common transport network, which 
makes bandwidth an important resource to manage. However, it doesn’t make sense to deny services 

Performance Management     483
to departments that need it. With a tool such as the Cisco NetFlow, you can measure resource 
utilization to make charge-back decisions and measure the compliance of service providers with the 
terms of service.
Performance Management
Performance management refers to measuring network behavior and its effectiveness in delivering 
frames, packets, and segments. In other words, performance management deals with how well a ser-
vice or a device performs its job. It can include monitoring the behavior of protocols and applica-
tions, the ability to reach from point A to point B, and timed responsiveness.
Network-management systems can monitor a deﬁned level of performance against set thresholds. If 
the network performance passes a threshold, the system triggers an alert. Using performance man-
agement can help you maintain network performance at an acceptable level. This maintenance is 
particularly important in converged networks that have voice, video, and data trafﬁc. Consistent net-
work performance is increasingly important as applications sensitive to both delay and variability 
share converged transport networks.
You can perform assessments on network performance prior to implementing latency-sensitive 
applications and use them afterward for monitoring. Examples of performance variables are 
network throughput, user response times, and line utilization.
Cisco recommends that performance management involve three main steps. First, you gather per-
formance data on the variables determined to be of greatest interest by network administrators. 
Second, you analyze the data to determine normal (baseline) levels. Finally, you deﬁne appropriate 
performance thresholds for each important variable so that crossing these thresholds indicates a 
network problem worthy of attention.
Although SLAs are addressed in detail later in this chapter, it is important to note that performance 
management is often associated with SLAs. This is particularly true regarding the agreement 
between a service provider and its customers. Just remember that if the agreed-upon metrics are 
not realistic or measurable, the SLA is meaningless. Statistics such as input queue drops, output 
queue drops, and ignored packets are useful for diagnosing performance-related problems.
Another interesting use of performance management is in testing pilots to see how a potential 
network device or system will function. Using performance-management devices and measures 
allows you to test and measure a new technology for viability. Another example of performance 
management is using network simulation to project how network growth will affect measured 
performance. Such simulation can alert administrators to impending problems so they can take 
counteractive measures. Performance management includes taking proactive steps to identify and, 
when possible, mitigate possible issues. 

484     Chapter 19: Network Management Functionality
Security Management
Security refers to authentication, access control, data conﬁdentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudi-
ation. Security management includes the maintenance and distribution of authentication and autho-
rization information, such as passwords and encryption keys. In other words, security management 
allows the administrator to control who has access to which resources.
Security management has taken center stage in the past several years and has expanded greatly. Secu-
rity management also includes conﬁguration and control of intrusion detection systems (IDSs); ﬁre-
walls; and trafﬁc ﬁltering by URL, address, or protocol to monitor activity and to detect or deﬂect 
malicious actions.
Some security is speciﬁc to network management, such as SNMP security. Important enhancements 
in SNMPv3, discussed in Chapter 18, “Network Management Technologies,” involved securing that 
protocol. Central to the security enhancements of SNMPv3 is deﬁning security between the collec-
tion device and the agent.
Another common security measure is using logs, whether they are syslogs or logs generated by var-
ious devices. Using audit logs to document logins or repeated unsuccessful attempts is also part 
of security management. Before any security measures are actually implemented, an organization 
should have a security policy. Cisco offers the Cisco Secure Policy Manager, which assists compa-
nies in creating, deploying, and evaluating security policies.
Service Levels
Internet access and connectivity provided by service providers are critical to a customer’s business. 
Business-continuity plans ensure that the network is always available. This view becomes even 
more important as voice and data networks continue to converge, and the network becomes a 
possible single point of telecommunications failure. 
How do you measure the ability of one service provider or network administration and management 
team to deliver the services expected? This is a critical question, considering that so much of the 
success of an organization depends on the network. Customers expect a guaranteed level of service, 
and service providers might even agree that the customer has to pay only for the levels it receives.
This concept isn’t new; Frame Relay networks have used a similar concept to charge for their ability 
to provide multiple tiers of bandwidth. The customer pays for a guaranteed amount of bandwidth 
speciﬁed in its Committed Information Rate (CIR). It might receive more than that speciﬁed band-
width, but if it receives less, the customer often pays a reduced charge for the period of degraded 
service.

SLAs     485
Service Levels Deﬁned
Because service levels can apply to internal as well as external providers, Cisco developed a way to 
deﬁne and manage these service levels. As discussed previously, service levels must be measurable 
and reasonable. This charge should sound familiar because corporate security policies should also 
use the same criteria. 
Just one service might have several service agreements that must be managed simultaneously. Cisco 
developed a method to organize and manage different service levels by deﬁning different compo-
nents. When managing a service level, the management solution must bring together the metrics 
from the various service components into a single service view. This idea is similar to event corre-
lation, which organizes multiple events. 
It can easily be confusing to have multiple vendors provide several service management applications 
and contracts. Without an overview for an organization to see how these service levels affect end-
to-end service, it is difﬁcult to detect when a service level is not achieved.
The Cisco end-to-end service-level management solution, CiscoWorks Service Management Solu-
tion, manages service levels between enterprises and internal or external service providers to ensure 
high-quality, economic delivery of converged network services. Open XML APIs enable full man-
agement of service levels through integration with in-house or third-party analysis and provisioning 
systems. 
SLAs
The most common service-level term is an SLA, which is a contact presented to the end user that 
deﬁnes the level of performance expected for a service. You can use several SLAs to deﬁne a service 
because each SLA can represent a speciﬁc metric that can be measured, reported, and monitored. 
These SLAs should be relevant to the business objectives of the company to which they are pre-
sented. Often service levels are used as “icing” on a service contract, and end users have no way 
of measuring the performance of services they receive against that agreement.
Service Level Contract
SLAs are organized by into SLCs. The SLC speciﬁes connectivity and performance agreements for 
an end-user service from a provider. The SLC typically includes multiple SLAs. A violation of any 
particular SLA could create a violation of the overall SLC. The service-level management solution 
needs to provide a means of managing collections of agreements that constitute a contract with the 
service provider.

486     Chapter 19: Network Management Functionality
SLM
Cisco developed an SLM that can manage service levels by allowing you to deﬁne SLAs and to 
ﬁgure out a method to test these SLAs. In addition, the SLM is an open platform to allow third-party 
tools from other vendors to enhance its services. This setup enables quicker development of the 
product with reporting and fault capabilities. The SLM also allows you to view and monitor the 
services referenced in the SLA.
The SLM enables you to deﬁne an SLC, which is either one or several SLAs grouped together based 
on business objectives. This way, you can monitor several SLAs at one time to assess the overall 
service delivery. You can also monitor multiple SLCs individually, drill down into SLA details, and 
monitor the percentage of SLA conformance for a given SLC.
Another component of SLM is the CM, which is an agent that collects and aggregates the perfor-
mance information needed to assess service levels. You can install CM on servers that meet its soft-
ware requirements.
Figure 19-1 shows a simple conﬁguration of the CM. It illustrates that the collection of data from 
remote collection managers can be aggregated into a single device.
Figure 19-1

NOTE
A Service Assurance Agent is residing on a Cisco device (part of IOS 12.l) and commu-
nicates to a collection manager. A collection manager can be deployed hierarchically to aggregate 
information locally to conserve bandwidth to the central CM.

The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the chapter. 
Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your CCDA exam, a 
well-prepared CCDA candidate should at a minimum know all the details in each “Foundation 
Summary” before going to take the exam.
A model called FCAPS represents a comprehensive network-management service.
Table 19-2 is a list of activities for each element of the FCAPS network-management model.
Deﬁning service levels and a way to manage these service levels is important because you should

Comprehensive Scenarios
Your CCDA exam will probably contain questions that require review of an accompanying case 
study. This chapter contains four case studies that are similar in style to the ones you might 
encounter on the CCDA exam. Read through each case study and answer the corresponding 
questions. You can ﬁnd the answers to the case-study questions at the end of each scenario. More 
than one solution can satisfy the customer’s requirements. In these cases, answers presented at 
the end of the chapter represent recommended solutions developed using good design practices. 
An explanation accompanies the answer where necessary.
Scenario One: Pearland Hospital
Mr. Robertson, the IT director at Pearland Hospital, is responsible for managing the network. Mr. 
Robertson has requested your help in proposing a network solution that will meet the hospital’s 
requirements. The hospital is growing and the management has released funds for network 
improvements.
The medical staff has requested the ability to access medical systems using laptops from any of 
the patient rooms. Doctors and nurses should be able to access patient medical records, x-rays, 
prescriptions, and recent patient information. Mr. Robertson purchased and placed new servers 
in the data center. The wireless LAN (WLAN) has approximately 30 laptops, with approxi-
mately 15 more due in six months. The servers must have high availability.
Patient rooms are on Floors 6 through 10 of the hospital building; doctors should be able to roam 
and access the network from any of the ﬂoors. A radio-frequency report mentions that a single 
access point located in each communication closet can reach all the rooms of each ﬂoor. The 
current network has 10 segments that reach a single router that also serves the Internet. The router 
is running Routing Information Protocol Version 1 (RIPv1). The backend new servers are 
located in the same segment as those used on Floor 1. Mr. Robertson mentioned that users have 
complained of slow access to the servers. He also handed you a table (Table 20-1) with current 
IP addresses.

496     Chapter 20: Comprehensive Scenarios
Mr. Robertson would like a proposal to upgrade the network with fast switches and provide faster 
access to the servers. The proposal should also cover secure WLAN access in Floors 6 through 10. 
Include an IP addressing scheme that will reduce the number of Class C networks the hospital uses. 
Mr. Robertson wants to reduce the number of networks leased from the Internet service provider (ISP).

Answers to Scenario One
1.
The hospital needs to provide access to patient records, prescriptions, and information from 
patient rooms.
2.
There were no cost restrictions discussed.
3.
The technical requirements are
— WLAN access from rooms in Floors 6 through 10
— Redundant access to servers in the data center
— Fast switching between LAN segments 
4.
The technical constraints are
— Servers must be located in the ﬁrst ﬂoor data-center rooms. 
5.
The logical diagram of the current network appears in Figure 20-1.
6.
The hospital does not use IP addresses effectively. It uses Class C networks on each ﬂoor. Each 
ﬂoor wastes more than 200 IP addresses because each Class C network provides up to 254 IP 
addresses.
7.
Recommend using a high-speed Layer 3 switch for the building LANs. They can use the router 
for Internet and WAN access.
8.
The primary recommendation is to use private addresses for the network. Using private 
addresses is a best-practice policy for private internal networks since 1996. With private 
addresses, the hospital could release eight of the Class C networks back to the ISP, retaining 
two for ISP connectivity.

Each subnet has 62 IP addresses for host addressing. Based on the preceding IP address scheme, 
Pearland Hospital does not need networks 200.100.4.0/24 through 200.100.10.0/24. 
9.
Recommend routing protocols that support variable-length subnet masks (VLSMs). The 
network is small. Recommend RIPv2 or Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol 
(EIGRP). Do not recommend Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) because of its conﬁguration 
complexity.
10.
Recommend using two access points on each ﬂoor for redundancy. Use a VLAN that spans 
Floors 6 through 10. Change the router to a high-speed Layer 3 switch. Use the router for 
Internet or WAN access.
11.
The diagram appears in Figure 20-2. The router is replaced by the L3 switch to provide high-
speed switching between LANs. Each ﬂoor has an IP subnet plus a subnet for the WLAN and 
another for the data center. Each ﬂoor has two access points for redundancy. Servers can 
connect using Fast EtherChannel or Gigabit Ethernet.

Scenario Two: Big Oil and Gas     501
Scenario Two: Big Oil and Gas
Mr. Drew is an IT director at Big Oil and Gas. He is in charge of the network infrastructure, includ-
ing routers and switches. Mr. Drew’s group includes personnel that can install and conﬁgure Cisco 
routers and switches. Big Oil and Gas is a medium-sized petrochemical company based in Houston. 
It also has operations in the Gulf and in South America.
The Big Oil and Gas CIO wants to begin migrating from the voice network to an IP telephony 
solution to reduce circuit and management costs. Existing data WAN circuits have less than 
50 percent utilization or less but do spike up to 80 percent when sporadic FTP transfers occur.
Mr. Drew hands you the diagram displayed in Figure 20-3. The exiting data network includes 
35 sites with approximately 30 people in each site. The network is hub-and-spoke with approxi-
mately 200 people at the headquarters. The WAN links range from 384 Kbps circuits to T1 speeds. 
Remote-site applications include statistical ﬁles and graphical-site diagrams that are transferred 
using FTP from remote sites to the headquarters.
Figure 20-3
Big Oil and Gas Current Network
Mr. Drew wants an IP telephony solution that manages the servers at headquarters but still provides 
redundancy or failover at the remote site. He mentions that he is concerned that the FTP trafﬁc might 
impact the VoIP trafﬁc. He wants to choose a site to implement a test before implementing IP 
telephony at all sites.

8.
Would you propose a prototype or a pilot?
9.
What solution would you present for voice redundancy at the remote sites?
10.
Diagram the proposed solution.
Answers to Scenario Two
1.
The company wants to provide voice services in a converged network.
2.
Their solution should provide reduced costs over the existing separate voice and data networks.
3.
The technical requirements are
— Provide IP telephony over the data network.
— Provide voice redundancy or failover for the remote sites.
— Prevent FTP trafﬁc from impacting the voice trafﬁc. 
4.
The technical constraints are
— Call-processing servers need to be located in the headquarters facilities. 
5.
There are 200 IP phones at headquarters and 35 * 30 = 1050 remote IP phones for a total of 
1250 IP phones.
6.
Propose the WAN centralized call-processing architecture with a call-manager (CM) cluster at 
headquarters.
7.
Use low-latency queuing (LLQ) on the WAN links to give the highest priority for voice trafﬁc. 
Then deﬁne trafﬁc classes for regular trafﬁc and FTP trafﬁc. Make bandwidth reservations for 
the voice trafﬁc and maximum bandwidth restrictions for the FTP trafﬁc. Call admission 
control (CAC) is recommended to limit the number of calls from and to a remote site. 
8.
To prove that calls can run over the WAN links, implement a pilot site. The pilot would test the 
functionality of the design over the WAN with or without FTP trafﬁc.
9.
Recommend the use of Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) to provide voice services in 
the event of WAN failure and reroute calls to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

Scenario Three: Super Consulting     503
10.
Figure 20-4 shows a diagram. The diagram shows headquarters and two remote sites for clarity. 
This architecture is duplicated for all remote sites. Each site uses a voice router that is con-
nected to both the IP WAN and the PSTN. SRST provides voice survivability in the case of 
WAN failure. A CM cluster is implemented at the headquarters. The CM servers are in the data 
center in a redundant network.
Figure 20-4
Headquarters and Two Remote Sites for Clarity
Scenario Three: Super Consulting
Ms. Thompson is the CIO of Super Consulting. Super Consulting is a professional-services 
company that provides programmers to enterprise clients. The company has a headquarters in 
Denver and a regional training center in Houston. More than 40 small sales ofﬁces are sparsely 
dispersed throughout the United States and Europe. Field sales representatives, management, and 
consultants use the network to access back-ofﬁce applications, e-mail, time and expense systems, 
and other internal websites. 
The sites are connected in a hierarchical mesh using Frame Relay as a WAN technology. They are 
using EIGRP as a routing protocol. Ms. Thompson mentions that they are looking for ways to reduce 
local loop and Frame Relay permanent virtual circuit (PVC) WAN costs. She wants a network 
design that uses a less-cost WAN technology to the remote sales ofﬁces. Table 20-4 lists the remote 
site requirements.

The Denver and Houston sites would have larger bandwidth speeds to accommodate the remote-site 
bandwidth. The solution would also need to accommodate home-ofﬁce and Internet dial-up users. 
The CIO mentioned that the solution should be veriﬁed before implementation.

Answers to Scenario Three
1.
The CIO needs to reduce WAN costs.
2.
No timelines were speciﬁed. The solution should provide a return on investment by reducing 
recurring WAN costs.
3.
The WAN technology should support the bandwidth requirements of 40 remote sites.
4.
The solution should support back-ofﬁce, e-mail, and expense systems. The network hubs are in 
Denver and Houston.

Scenario Four: Sound Masters Inc.     505
5.
Propose that virtual private network (VPN) technology replace the Frame Relay WAN. Place 
Cisco VPN concentrators in Denver and Houston and IP Security (IPSec) tunnels through the 
Internet to connect the remote ofﬁces. There are no PVC costs when using VPNs.
6.
Where available, recommend the use of business DSL service. DSL would provide local Inter-
net access, which is on average less expensive than other access technologies. DSL providers 
support the speed requirements of Super Consulting. The remote site would then use a Cisco 
router to establish the VPN tunnels to the hub sites.
7.
The current routing protocol is EIGRP, which supports VLSMs and route summarization and 
does not send periodic route updates. It is adequate for the current and proposed network.
8.
Recommend that a pilot be implemented to verify the solution. A pilot site could ensure that the 
solution meets the client’s requirements and that all applications can run appropriately.
9.
As shown in Figure 20-5, the proposed solution uses VPN technology over the Internet to 
provide WAN connectivity from the hub sites to the remote sites. Redundant tunnels provide 
redundancy to the hubs. The solution would support home-ofﬁce users using the Cisco VPN 
client software.

9.
The utilization of the 256 Kbps circuit is averaging more than 85 percent. Should the 
provisioned bandwidth be increased?
10.
If Mr. Bland rejects the use of the PIX Firewall, how can you implement security?
Answers to Scenario Four
1.
They want to implement the necessary infrastructure to sell car-audio products over the 
Internet.
2.
The infrastructure needs to be in place before the website kickoff. You must submit the design 
in a week.
3.
Design redundant Internet connections for Sound Masters. Implement security to control access 
to the business web servers.
4.
You are using the Internet connectivity module of the Enterprise Edge. This module contains 
the Enterprise Edge infrastructure that connects to ISP. 
5.
Use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) between the enterprise and SP routers to exchange routes. 
BGP is an EGP.
6.
The solution appears in Figure 20-7. This solution provides for a multihomed solution with two 
ISPs connected to a single router. There is ISP redundancy with this solution. You can conﬁgure 
exterior BGP (eBGP) to receive routes and let the routing protocol decide which path to take. 
This is the least-cost solution. The disadvantages of this solution are that there is no router or 
ﬁrewall redundancy. If the enterprise router fails, users lose their connections to the servers.

7.
A possible solution appears in Figure 20-8. With two routers, each is connected to separate 
ISPs. The routers use eBGP with the ISPs and interior BGP (iBGP) between the enterprise rout-
ers. The advantage of this solution is that it provides for ISP redundancy, circuit redundancy, 
and router redundancy. There is no ﬁrewall redundancy in this solution.

Dual-Router Multihomed Internet Solution
8.
Implement a PIX Firewall to provide stateful security to the web servers. The demilitarized 
zone (DMZ) would be the third leg off the ﬁrewall. Figure 20-9 shows the diagram of the 
network with the DMZ. This design has the advantage of greater device availability, but 
the disadvantage is greater cost.

Yes. If the utilization of a circuit averages more than 70 percent, it should be increased, even if 
there will be two circuits. One circuit should be able to handle the utilized bandwidth of both

You are designing a WAN solution for a customer that is setting up a small satellite ofﬁce in 
New York. The customer needs medium- to high-bandwidth access at this location for down-
loading constant data streams from the headquarters in Los Angeles. The satellite ofﬁce also 
needs to upload large amounts of data frequently to headquarters. The client is interested in 
a mature and time-tested WAN technology. Which WAN technology should you recommend? 
Why?
Answer: Frame Relay. Frame Relay offers medium to high bandwidth in both directions and is 
readily available in almost all areas of the country. Frame Relay is also a mature technology. 
5.
Describe an ATM cell and explain why cells are well suited for the transmission of voice and 
video trafﬁc.
Answer: ATM cells consist of 53 octets, or bytes. The ﬁrst 5 bytes contain cell-header 
information, and the remaining 48 contain the payload (user information). Small, ﬁxed-length 
cells are well suited to transferring voice and video trafﬁc because such trafﬁc is intolerant of 
delays that result from waiting in the interface output queue while a large data packet is 
transferred.
6.
Describe the ISDN options of BRI and PRI, focusing on available bandwidth for each 
technology.
Answer: ISDN BRI offers two bearer (B) channels and a delta (D) channel. BRI B channels 
transmit data and operate at 64 Kbps. The BRI D channel handles signaling and operates at 16 
Kbps. BRI also provides for framing control and other overhead, thus bringing the total bit rate 
to 192 Kbps. In North America and Japan, PRI ISDN over T1 media provides 23 B channels 
and 1 D channel. Unlike BRI, the D channel in PRI operates at 64 Kbps as well, bringing the 
total bit rate to 1.544 Mbps. In Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world, PRI is provi-
sioned over E1 media and features 30 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel for a total bit rate 
of 2.048 Mbps.

What is the purpose of FECN and BECN within Frame Relay technology?
Answer: Frame Relay reduces network overhead by implementing simple congestion-
notiﬁcation mechanisms rather than explicit, per-virtual-circuit ﬂow control. The congestion-
notiﬁcation mechanisms are called FECNs and BECNs, or forward explicit congestion 
notiﬁcations and backward explicit congestion notiﬁcations. 
8.
What is the most common type of virtual circuit used with Frame Relay? With X.25?
Answer: Frame Relay – PVC; X.25 - SVC.
9.
What is the basic Layer 2 technology behind MPLS encapsulation?
Answer: MPLS functions by “tagging” or “labeling” packets as they arrive at the service 
provider network. Core routers then forward the trafﬁc appropriately using QoS, trafﬁc 
engineering, or security mechanisms as required by the trafﬁc. 
10.
What is the purpose of the ELSR in MPLS technology?
Answer: Edge Label Switch Routers are located at the ingress point of service provider 
networks and are responsible for applying (removing) label information from incoming 
(outgoing) packets.

b. Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of customer requirements, the 
characterization of the existing network, and the design of the new WAN topology.
2.
f. The most popular DSL option, ADSL, is asymmetric. It allows more bandwidth 
downstream—from a Network Service Provider’s (NSP’s) central ofﬁce to the customer site—
than upstream from the subscriber to the central ofﬁce.
3.
c. Jitter is a measure of the deviation in delay experienced in a network. Designers often 
scrutinize this measurement in voice and video networks because they tend to be intolerant of 
jitter when this value is excessive.
4.
c. Cisco recommends that designers avoid compression usage if network-equipment CPU 
utilization levels are at 65 percent or greater.
5.
c. Larger window sizes allow network equipment to send more data prior to receiving an 
acknowledgement from the destination system. This has the potential to improve the 
performance of WAN connections.

a. Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression reduces the size of the TCP/IP headers to as few 
as three bytes.
7.
c. Designers do not require queuing services within WAN designs if links are never congested. 
If WAN links consistently demonstrate congestion, queuing is not the answer; an upgrade is 
more appropriate.
8.
b. PQ allows designers to give higher priority to certain types of time-sensitive or mission-
critical protocols. PQ establishes four interface output queues. The designer assigns each queue 
a priority and deﬁnes trafﬁc types for each queue. PQ then services all trafﬁc in higher-priority 
queues prior to servicing the lower-priority queues. 
9.
d. CQ establishes up to 16 interface output queues. CQ cycles through each queue to send some 
data, sending the amount from each queue speciﬁed by the designer. 
10.
a. Trafﬁc shaping delays excess packets by holding them in buffers and then releasing them at 
preconﬁgured rates.
Q&A
1.
Describe the Cisco recommended process for designing a WAN solution. 
Answer: Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of customer requirements, 
the characterization of the existing network, and the design of the new WAN topology as a 
simple process for designing WAN solutions.
2.
Name three common design factors for creating WAN solutions.
Answer: Cisco identiﬁes the following design factors: application access, technology, and cost.
3.
Describe the options for WAN media and equipment ownership. 
Answer: WAN ownership falls into three broad categories, private, leased, and shared. With 
privately owned WAN designs, organizations must purchase all of the physical layer media 
(copper, ﬁber, wireless, coaxial) and the terminal equipment that connects it. Leased WAN 
arrangements involve dedicated bandwidth leased to the organization by a service provider. 
With shared WAN access, many companies share the bandwidth that the provider has available.

The OSI Reference Model and 
Numeric Conversion
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a mandatory topic in any internetworking 
book. The CCDA candidate needs to understand the OSI model and identify which OSI layers 
host the different networking protocols. This appendix provides an overview and general 
understanding of the OSI reference model.
Also covered in this appendix is the numeric conversion of binary, decimal, and hexadecimal 
numbers. Quickly converting these numbers will help you answer test questions.
OSI Model Overview
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the OSI model in 1984, 
and revisited it in 1994, to coordinate standards development for interconnected information-
processing systems. The model describes seven layers that start with the physical connection 
and end with the application. As shown in Figure 2-1, the seven layers are physical, data link, 
network, transport, session, presentation, and application.
Figure B-1
Seven-Layer OSI Model
The OSI model divides the tasks involved in moving data into seven smaller, more manageable 
layers. Each layer provides services to the layer above, performs at least the functions speciﬁed 
by the model, and expects the deﬁned services from the layer below. The model does not deﬁne

584     Appendix B: The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion
the precise nature of the interface between layers or the protocol used between peers at the same 
layer in different instantiations of a protocol stack. The design of the model encourages each layer 
to be implemented independently. For example, you can run an application over IP (Layer 3), Ether-
net (Layer 2), Frame Relay (Layer 2), or Gigabit Ethernet (Layer 2). As the packets route through 
the Internet, the Layer 2 media changes independently from the upper-layer protocols. The OSI 
model helps standardize discussion of the design and construction of networks for developers and 
hardware manufacturers. It also provides network engineers and analysts with a framework useful 
in understanding internetworking.
Layered implementations of internetworking technologies do not necessarily map directly to the 
OSI model. For example, the TCP/IP architecture model describes only four layers, with the upper 
layer mapping to the three upper layers of the OSI model (application, presentation, and session). 
The development of IP predates the OSI model. For a more thorough discussion of the TCP/IP 
model, see Chapter 9, “Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4).” 
The following sections provide a description and sample protocols for each OSI layer.
Physical Layer (OSI Layer 1)
The physical layer describes the transportation of raw bits over physical media. It deﬁnes signaling 
speciﬁcations and media types and interfaces. It also describes voltage levels, physical data rates, 
and maximum transmission distances. In summary, it deals with the electrical, mechanical, 
functional, and procedural speciﬁcations for links between networked systems.
Examples of physical layer speciﬁcations are
I
EIA/TIA-232 (Electronic Industries Association/ Telecommunications Industry Association)
I
EIA/TIA-449
I
V.35
I
IEEE 802 LAN and metropolitan-area network (MAN) standards
I
Physical layer (PHY) groups Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy 
(SONET/SDH)
I
Maximum cable distances of the Ethernet family, Token Ring, and Fiber Distributed Data 
Interface (FDDI)
Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)
This layer is concerned with the reliable transport of data across a physical link. Data at this layer 
is formatted into frames. Data link speciﬁcations include frame sequencing, ﬂow control, synchro-
nization, error notiﬁcation, physical network topology, and physical addressing. This layer converts 

OSI Model Overview     585
frames into bits when sending information and converts bits into frames when receiving information 
from the physical media. Bridges and switches operate in the data link layer.
Because of the complexity of this OSI layer, the IEEE subdivides the data link layer into three sub-
layers for LANs. Figure 2-2 shows how Layer 2 is subdivided. The upper layer is the logical link 
sublayer, which manages the communications between devices. The bridging layer, deﬁned by 
IEEE 802.1, is the middle layer. The lowest layer is the MAC sublayer, which manages the protocol 
access to the physical layer and ultimately the actual media. Systems attached to a common data link 
layer have a unique address on that data link layer.

I
Ethernet implementations (IEEE 802.3)
I
Token Ring (IEEE 802.5)
I
Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11)
Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)
The network layer is concerned with routing information and methods to determine paths to a 
destination. Information at this layer is called packets. Speciﬁcations include routing protocols, 
logical network addressing, and packet fragmentation. Routers operate in this layer. 
Examples of network layer speciﬁcations are

Routing protocols
— Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
— Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
— Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
— Intermediate System–to-Intermediate System (IS-IS)
— Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP)
Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)
The transport layer provides reliable, transparent transport of data segments from upper layers. It 
provides end-to-end error checking and recovery, multiplexing, virtual circuit management, and 
ﬂow control. Messages are assigned a sequence number at the transmission end. At the receiving 
end, the packets are reassembled, checked for errors, and acknowledged. Flow control manages the 
data transmission to ensure that the transmitting device does not send more data than the receiving 
device can process.
Examples of transport layer speciﬁcations are
I
TCP
I
Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
I
Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX)
I
AppleTalk’s Transaction Protocol (ATP)
I
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
Session Layer (OSI Layer 5)
The session layer provides a control structure for communication between applications. It 
establishes, manages, and terminates communication connections called sessions. Communication 
sessions consist of service requests and responses that occur between applications on different 
devices. 
Examples of speciﬁcations that operate at the session layer are
I
AppleTalk’s Zone Information Protocol (ZIP)
I
DECnet’s Session Control Protocol (SCP)
I
H.245, H.225

OSI Model Overview     587
Presentation Layer (OSI Layer 6)
The presentation layer provides application layer entities with services to ensure information is 
preserved during transfer. Knowledge of the syntax selected at the application layer allows selection 
of compatible transfer syntax if a change is required. This layer provides conversion of character-
representation formats as might be required for reliable transfer. Voice coding schemes are speciﬁed 
at this layer.
An example of a speciﬁcation that operates at the presentation layer is Abstract Syntax 
Notation 1 (ASN.1)
Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)
The application layer provides the user or operating system access to the network services. It 
interacts with software applications by identifying communication resources, determining network 
availability, and distributing information services. It also provides synchronization between the peer 
applications residing on separate systems.
Examples of application layer speciﬁcations are
I
Telnet
I
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
I
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
I
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
I
Network File System (NFS)
I
Association Control Service Element (ACSE)
Example of Layered Communication
Suppose that you use a Telnet application. Telnet maps into the top three layers of the OSI model. 
In Figure B-3, a user on Host 1 enables the Telnet application to access a remote host (Host 2). The 
Telnet application provides a user interface (application layer) to network services. As deﬁned in 
RFC 854, ASCII is the default code format. There is no session layer deﬁned for Telnet (not an OSI 
protocol). Per the RFC, Telnet uses TCP for connectivity (transport layer). The TCP segment is 
placed into an IP packet (network layer) with a destination IP address of Host 2. The IP packet 
is placed into an Ethernet frame (data link layer), which is converted into bits and sent onto the wire 
(physical layer).

588     Appendix B: The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion
Figure B-3
Telnet Example
When the frame arrives at Router 1, it converts the bits into a frame; removes the frame headers (data 
link); checks the destination IP address (network); places a serial link header to the packet, making 
it a serial frame; and forwards the frame to the serial link (data link), which sends it as bits.  
Router 2 receives the bits, converts to a frame; removes the serial encapsulation headers; checks the 
destination IP address (network); adds an Ethernet header to the packet, making it a frame; and 
places a frame on Ethernet 2 (data link). Host 2 receives bits (physical) from the Ethernet cable and 
converts the bits into a frame (data link). Then, the IP protocol is examined and the packet data is 
forwarded to TCP, which checks the segment number and for errors and then forwards the segment 
to TCP port 23 (Telnet), which is the application. 
Numeric Conversion
This section focuses on the techniques for converting between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal 
numbers. Although the exam might not have a speciﬁc question about converting a binary number 
to decimal, you need to know how to convert these numbers to do problems on the test. A diagram 
might show a Token Ring with a decimal number, but the routing information ﬁeld (RIF) might be 
shown as hexadecimal. An IP address could be shown as binary, as hexadecimal, or in traditional 
dotted-decimal format. Some show commands have output information in hexadecimal or binary 
formats.

Numeric Conversion     589
Hexadecimal Numbers
The hexadecimal numeric system uses 16 digits, instead of 10 digits used by the decimal system. 
Table B-1 shows the hexadecimal digits and their decimal equivalent values.
Hexadecimal Representation
It is common to represent a hexadecimal number with “0x” before the number so that it is not con-
fused with a decimal number. The hexadecimal number of decimal 16 is written as 0x10, not 10. 
Another method is to put a subscript h to the right on the number, such as 10h. It is also common to 
use the term hex when speaking of hexadecimal. Much of the text that follows uses hex.

590     Appendix B: The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion
Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal
First things ﬁrst: memorize Table B-1. For larger numbers, there are two methods. The ﬁrst method 
is to convert decimal to binary and then from binary to hex. The second method is to divide the 
decimal number by 16—the residual is the rightmost hexadecimal digit—and then keep dividing 
until the number is not divisible anymore. For the ﬁrst method, use the schemes described in later 
sections. For the second method, follow the examples described here. 
First, divide the decimal number by 16. The remainder of the division is the least signiﬁcant (ﬁrst) 
hexadecimal digit. Continue to divide the quotients (answer) of the divisions by 16 until the quotient 
is 0. The remainder value of each later division is converted to a hexadecimal digit and prepended 
to the previous value. The ﬁnal remainder is the most signiﬁcant digit of the hexadecimal equivalent. 
For large numbers, you might have to divide many times, This process will be clearer in the 
following examples.
Conversion Example B-1: Convert 26 to Its Hex Equivalent
Conversion Example B-2: Convert 96 to Its Hex Equivalent
Divide by 16:

Numeric Conversion     591
Conversion Example B-3: Convert 375 to Its Hex Equivalent
Conversion Example B-4: Convert 218 to Its Hex Equivalent
Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal
To convert a hex number to decimal, take the rightmost digit and convert it to decimal (for example, 
0xC = 12). Then, add this number to the second rightmost digit * 16 and third rightmost digit * 256. 
Don’t expect to convert numbers larger than 255 on the CCDA exam because the upper limit of IP 
addresses in dotted-decimal format is 255 (although Token Ring numbers do reach 4096). Some 
examples follow.
Divide by 16 first:
23
16
375
-32
55
-48
7
Now divide 23 by 16:
1
16
23
-16
7
Now take the residual from the first division (7) and concatentate it 
with the residual from the second division (7), plus the result of the 
second division (1), and the answer is 177h.
Divide by 16:
  13 = Dh

10 = Ah
Answer: DAh

Conversion Example B-8: Convert 1DAh to Decimal
Alternative Method to Convert from Hex to Decimal
Another way is to just convert from hex to binary and then binary to decimal. Conversion from 
binary to decimal follows.
Binary Numbers
The binary number system uses two digits: 1 and 0. Computer systems use binary numbers. IP 
addresses and MAC addresses are represented by binary numbers. The number of binary 1s or 0s is 
the number of bits, short for binary digits. For example, 01101010 is a binary number with 8 bits. 
An IP address has 32 bits, and a MAC address has 48 bits. As shown in Table B-2, IP addresses are 
usually represented in dotted-decimal format; therefore, it is helpful to know how to convert 
1 x 256 = 256
7 x   16 = 112
7 x     1 =     7
375d
6 x 16 =   96
0 x   1 =     0   
96d
1 x 256 = 256
0 x   16 =     0
0 x     1 =     0

  1 x 256 = 256
13 x   16 = 208
10 x     1 =   10

Numeric Conversion     593
between binary and decimal numbers. MAC addresses are usually represented in hexadecimal 
numbers; therefore, it is helpful to know how to convert between binary and hexadecimal numbers.
The CCDA candidate should memorize Table B-3, which shows numbers from 0 to 16 in decimal, 
binary, and hexadecimal formats.

Converting Binary to Hexadecimal
To convert binary numbers to hex, group the bits into groups of four, starting with the right-justiﬁed 
bits. Groups of four bits are often called nibbles. Each nibble can be represented by a single 
hexadecimal digit. A group of two nibbles is an octet, 8 bits. Examples follow.
Conversion Example B-9: Convert 0010011101 to Hex
Conversion Example B-10: Convert 0010101001011001000010110001 to Hex
Converting Hexadecimal to Binary
This procedure is also easy. Simply change the hex digits into their 4-bit equivalent. Examples 
follow.
Conversion Example B-11: Convert 0DEAD0 into Hex
Conversion Example B-12: Convert AA0101 into Hex
Converting Binary to Decimal
To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each instance of 0 or 1 by the power of 2 associated 
with the position of the bit in the binary number. The ﬁrst bit, starting from the right, is associated 
with 20 = 1. The value of the exponent increases by 1 as each bit is processed, working leftward. As

Numeric Conversion     595
shown in Table 2-4, each bit in the binary number 10101010 has a decimal equivalent from 0 to 128 
based on the value of the bit multiplied by a power of 2 associated with the bit position. It is similar 
to decimal numbers where the numbers are based on powers of 10: 1s, 10s, 100s, and so on. In 
decimal, the number 111 is (1*100) + (1*10) + (1*1). In binary, the number 11111111 is the sum 
of (1*27) + (1*26) + (1*25) + (1*24) + (1*23) + (1*22) + (1*21) + (1*20) = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 
+ 4 + 2 + 1 = 255. For 10101010, the result is 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 170. Examples 
follow.
Conversion Example B-13: Convert 10110111 to Decimal
Conversion Example B-14: Convert 11011 to Decimal
Conversion Example B-15: Convert 11111111 to Decimal
Converting Decimal to Binary Numbers
This procedure is similar to converting from hex to decimal (by dividing), but now you divide the 
decimal number by 2. You use each residual to build the binary number, by prepending each residual 
bit to the previous bit starting with the right. Repeat the procedure until you cannot divide anymore. 
The only problem is that for large numbers, you might have to divide many times. The number 
of divisions can be reduced by ﬁrst converting the decimal value to a hexadecimal value and then

Just memorize 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. Use it as you read a binary number from 
right to left. This technique should be helpful in fast conversions.

converting the intermediate result to binary representation. After the following example, you will 
ﬁnd an alternate method suitable for use with decimal values between 0 and 255 that can be 
represented in a single octet.
Conversion Example B-16: Convert 26 to Binary
Alternative Method
The dividing procedure described earlier works; it just takes a lot of time. Another way is to remem-
ber the bit position values within a byte—128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1—and play with the bits until the 
sum adds up to the desired number. This method works when converting integer values between 0 
and 255 inclusive. Table B-5 shows these binary numbers and their decimal value.

The first bit is 0; now divide 13 by 2. [0]

The fourth bit is 1; the leftmost bit is the division
result at the top, which is one. [11010]
 Answer: 11010

Numeric Conversion     597
For example, to convert 26, you know that it is a number smaller than 128, 64, and 32, so those three 
bits will be 0 (000?????). Now, you need to ﬁnd a combination from 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 that adds up 
to 26. This method involves using subtraction to compute the remaining number. Start with the 
largest number, and make the bit at 16 a 1 (0001????). The difference between 26 and 16 is 10 so 
what combination of 8, 4, 2, and 1 gives 10? (1010.) Therefore, the answer is 00011010. You might 
think this method involves too much guesswork, but it becomes second nature after some practice.

The number is larger than 128; enable that bit. [1???????]
How far is 137 from 128: 9; enable the remaining bits for a value of 9 [1???1001].
The answer is 10001001.
The number is larger than 128; enable that bit. [1???????]
Because 211–128 is greater than 64, enable that bit. [11??????] (Remember that 
11000000 = 192.)
Because 211–192=19, enable bits 16, 2, and 1. [11?1??11]
The answer is 11010011.

598     Appendix B: The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion
In addition to remembering the bit-position values (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), it helps to remember 
network subnet masks values. Remembering them makes it easier to ﬁgure out whether you need to 
enable a bit. Table B-6 summarizes the binary subnet mask numbers and their decimal values.

ATM Adaptation Layer. A service-dependent sublayer of the data link layer. The AAL 
accepts data from different applications and presents it to the ATM layer in the form of 48-byte ATM 
payload segments. AALs consist of two sublayers: CS and SAR. AALs differ on the basis of the 
source-destination timing used (CBR or VBR) and whether they are used for connection-oriented 
or connectionless mode data transfer. As of 2002, the four types of AAL recommended by the ITU-T 
are AAL1, AAL2, AAL3/4, and AAL5.
AAL1
ATM adaptation layer type 1. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. AAL1 is used 
for connection-oriented, delay-sensitive services requiring constant bit rates, such as uncompressed 
video and other isochronous trafﬁc.
AAL2

for connection-oriented services that support a variable bit rate, such as some isochronous video and 
voice trafﬁc.

networks. ABR is used for connections that do not require timing relationships between source and 
destination. ABR provides no guarantees in terms of cell loss or delay, providing only best-effort

describing the network’s status and its capability to successfully deliver data. 2. Area Border Router. 
A router located on the border of one or more OSPF areas that connects those areas to the backbone 
network. ABRs are considered members of both the OSPF backbone and the attached areas. ABRs, 
therefore, maintain routing tables describing both the backbone topology and the topology of the 
other areas.

trafﬁc policing
A process used to measure the actual trafﬁc ﬂow across a given connection and 
compare it to the connection’s total admissible trafﬁc ﬂow. Trafﬁc outside the agreed-upon ﬂow can 
be tagged (where the cell loss priority [CLP] bit is set to 1) and can be discarded en route if conges-
tion develops. Trafﬁc policing is used in ATM, Frame Relay, and other types of networks. Trafﬁc 
policing is also called admission control, permit processing, rate enforcement, and usage parameter 
control (UPC).

VoIP
voice over IP. The capability to carry normal telephony-style voice over an IP-based Internet 
with POTS-like functionality, reliability, and voice quality. VoIP lets a router carry voice trafﬁc (for 
example, telephone calls and faxes) over an IP network. In VoIP, the DSP segments the voice signal 
into frames, which then are coupled in groups of two and stored in voice packets. These voice 
packets are transported using IP in compliance with ITU-T speciﬁcation H.323.
VPI
virtual path identiﬁer. An 8-bit ﬁeld in the header of an ATM cell. The VPI, together with the 
VCI, identiﬁes a cell’s next destination as it passes through a series of ATM switches on the way to 
its destination. ATM switches use the VPI/VCI ﬁelds to identify the next VCL through which a cell 
needs to transit on the way to its ﬁnal destination. The VPI’s function is similar to that of the DLCI 
in Frame Relay

You are designing a WAN solution for a customer that is setting up a small satellite ofﬁce in 
New York. The customer needs medium- to high-bandwidth access at this location for down-
loading constant data streams from the headquarters in Los Angeles. The satellite ofﬁce also 
needs to upload large amounts of data frequently to headquarters. The client is interested in 
a mature and time-tested WAN technology. Which WAN technology should you recommend? 
Why?
Answer: Frame Relay. Frame Relay offers medium to high bandwidth in both directions and is 
readily available in almost all areas of the country. Frame Relay is also a mature technology. 
5.
Describe an ATM cell and explain why cells are well suited for the transmission of voice and 
video trafﬁc.
Answer: ATM cells consist of 53 octets, or bytes. The ﬁrst 5 bytes contain cell-header 
information, and the remaining 48 contain the payload (user information). Small, ﬁxed-length 
cells are well suited to transferring voice and video trafﬁc because such trafﬁc is intolerant of 
delays that result from waiting in the interface output queue while a large data packet is 
transferred.
6.
Describe the ISDN options of BRI and PRI, focusing on available bandwidth for each 
technology.
Answer: ISDN BRI offers two bearer (B) channels and a delta (D) channel. BRI B channels 
transmit data and operate at 64 Kbps. The BRI D channel handles signaling and operates at 16 
Kbps. BRI also provides for framing control and other overhead, thus bringing the total bit rate 
to 192 Kbps. In North America and Japan, PRI ISDN over T1 media provides 23 B channels 
and 1 D channel. Unlike BRI, the D channel in PRI operates at 64 Kbps as well, bringing the 
total bit rate to 1.544 Mbps. In Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world, PRI is provi-
sioned over E1 media and features 30 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel for a total bit rate 
of 2.048 Mbps.

What is the purpose of FECN and BECN within Frame Relay technology?
Answer: Frame Relay reduces network overhead by implementing simple congestion-
notiﬁcation mechanisms rather than explicit, per-virtual-circuit ﬂow control. The congestion-
notiﬁcation mechanisms are called FECNs and BECNs, or forward explicit congestion 
notiﬁcations and backward explicit congestion notiﬁcations. 
8.
What is the most common type of virtual circuit used with Frame Relay? With X.25?
Answer: Frame Relay – PVC; X.25 - SVC.
9.
What is the basic Layer 2 technology behind MPLS encapsulation?
Answer: MPLS functions by “tagging” or “labeling” packets as they arrive at the service 
provider network. Core routers then forward the trafﬁc appropriately using QoS, trafﬁc 
engineering, or security mechanisms as required by the trafﬁc. 
10.
What is the purpose of the ELSR in MPLS technology?
Answer: Edge Label Switch Routers are located at the ingress point of service provider 
networks and are responsible for applying (removing) label information from incoming 
(outgoing) packets.

b. Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of customer requirements, the 
characterization of the existing network, and the design of the new WAN topology.
2.
f. The most popular DSL option, ADSL, is asymmetric. It allows more bandwidth 
downstream—from a Network Service Provider’s (NSP’s) central ofﬁce to the customer site—
than upstream from the subscriber to the central ofﬁce.
3.
c. Jitter is a measure of the deviation in delay experienced in a network. Designers often 
scrutinize this measurement in voice and video networks because they tend to be intolerant of 
jitter when this value is excessive.
4.
c. Cisco recommends that designers avoid compression usage if network-equipment CPU 
utilization levels are at 65 percent or greater.
5.
c. Larger window sizes allow network equipment to send more data prior to receiving an 
acknowledgement from the destination system. This has the potential to improve the 
performance of WAN connections.

a. Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression reduces the size of the TCP/IP headers to as few 
as three bytes.
7.
c. Designers do not require queuing services within WAN designs if links are never congested. 
If WAN links consistently demonstrate congestion, queuing is not the answer; an upgrade is 
more appropriate.
8.
b. PQ allows designers to give higher priority to certain types of time-sensitive or mission-
critical protocols. PQ establishes four interface output queues. The designer assigns each queue 
a priority and deﬁnes trafﬁc types for each queue. PQ then services all trafﬁc in higher-priority 
queues prior to servicing the lower-priority queues. 
9.
d. CQ establishes up to 16 interface output queues. CQ cycles through each queue to send some 
data, sending the amount from each queue speciﬁed by the designer. 
10.
a. Trafﬁc shaping delays excess packets by holding them in buffers and then releasing them at 
preconﬁgured rates.
Q&A
1.
Describe the Cisco recommended process for designing a WAN solution. 
Answer: Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of customer requirements, 
the characterization of the existing network, and the design of the new WAN topology as a 
simple process for designing WAN solutions.
2.
Name three common design factors for creating WAN solutions.
Answer: Cisco identiﬁes the following design factors: application access, technology, and cost.
3.
Describe the options for WAN media and equipment ownership. 
Answer: WAN ownership falls into three broad categories, private, leased, and shared. With 
privately owned WAN designs, organizations must purchase all of the physical layer media 
(copper, ﬁber, wireless, coaxial) and the terminal equipment that connects it. Leased WAN 
arrangements involve dedicated bandwidth leased to the organization by a service provider. 
With shared WAN access, many companies share the bandwidth that the provider has available.

The OSI Reference Model and 
Numeric Conversion
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a mandatory topic in any internetworking 
book. The CCDA candidate needs to understand the OSI model and identify which OSI layers 
host the different networking protocols. This appendix provides an overview and general 
understanding of the OSI reference model.
Also covered in this appendix is the numeric conversion of binary, decimal, and hexadecimal 
numbers. Quickly converting these numbers will help you answer test questions.
OSI Model Overview
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the OSI model in 1984, 
and revisited it in 1994, to coordinate standards development for interconnected information-
processing systems. The model describes seven layers that start with the physical connection 
and end with the application. As shown in Figure 2-1, the seven layers are physical, data link, 
network, transport, session, presentation, and application.
Figure B-1
Seven-Layer OSI Model
The OSI model divides the tasks involved in moving data into seven smaller, more manageable 
layers. Each layer provides services to the layer above, performs at least the functions speciﬁed 
by the model, and expects the deﬁned services from the layer below. The model does not deﬁne

584     Appendix B: The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion
the precise nature of the interface between layers or the protocol used between peers at the same 
layer in different instantiations of a protocol stack. The design of the model encourages each layer 
to be implemented independently. For example, you can run an application over IP (Layer 3), Ether-
net (Layer 2), Frame Relay (Layer 2), or Gigabit Ethernet (Layer 2). As the packets route through 
the Internet, the Layer 2 media changes independently from the upper-layer protocols. The OSI 
model helps standardize discussion of the design and construction of networks for developers and 
hardware manufacturers. It also provides network engineers and analysts with a framework useful 
in understanding internetworking.
Layered implementations of internetworking technologies do not necessarily map directly to the 
OSI model. For example, the TCP/IP architecture model describes only four layers, with the upper 
layer mapping to the three upper layers of the OSI model (application, presentation, and session). 
The development of IP predates the OSI model. For a more thorough discussion of the TCP/IP 
model, see Chapter 9, “Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4).” 
The following sections provide a description and sample protocols for each OSI layer.
Physical Layer (OSI Layer 1)
The physical layer describes the transportation of raw bits over physical media. It deﬁnes signaling 
speciﬁcations and media types and interfaces. It also describes voltage levels, physical data rates, 
and maximum transmission distances. In summary, it deals with the electrical, mechanical, 
functional, and procedural speciﬁcations for links between networked systems.
Examples of physical layer speciﬁcations are
I
EIA/TIA-232 (Electronic Industries Association/ Telecommunications Industry Association)
I
EIA/TIA-449
I
V.35
I
IEEE 802 LAN and metropolitan-area network (MAN) standards
I
Physical layer (PHY) groups Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy 
(SONET/SDH)
I
Maximum cable distances of the Ethernet family, Token Ring, and Fiber Distributed Data 
Interface (FDDI)
Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)
This layer is concerned with the reliable transport of data across a physical link. Data at this layer 
is formatted into frames. Data link speciﬁcations include frame sequencing, ﬂow control, synchro-
nization, error notiﬁcation, physical network topology, and physical addressing. This layer converts 

OSI Model Overview     585
frames into bits when sending information and converts bits into frames when receiving information 
from the physical media. Bridges and switches operate in the data link layer.
Because of the complexity of this OSI layer, the IEEE subdivides the data link layer into three sub-
layers for LANs. Figure 2-2 shows how Layer 2 is subdivided. The upper layer is the logical link 
sublayer, which manages the communications between devices. The bridging layer, deﬁned by 
IEEE 802.1, is the middle layer. The lowest layer is the MAC sublayer, which manages the protocol 
access to the physical layer and ultimately the actual media. Systems attached to a common data link 
layer have a unique address on that data link layer.

Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11)
Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)
The network layer is concerned with routing information and methods to determine paths to a 
destination. Information at this layer is called packets. Speciﬁcations include routing protocols, 
logical network addressing, and packet fragmentation. Routers operate in this layer.

Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)
The transport layer provides reliable, transparent transport of data segments from upper layers. It 
provides end-to-end error checking and recovery, multiplexing, virtual circuit management, and 
ﬂow control. Messages are assigned a sequence number at the transmission end. At the receiving 
end, the packets are reassembled, checked for errors, and acknowledged. Flow control manages the 
data transmission to ensure that the transmitting device does not send more data than the receiving 
device can process.
Examples of transport layer speciﬁcations are
I
TCP
I
Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
I
Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX)
I
AppleTalk’s Transaction Protocol (ATP)
I
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
Session Layer (OSI Layer 5)
The session layer provides a control structure for communication between applications. It 
establishes, manages, and terminates communication connections called sessions. Communication 
sessions consist of service requests and responses that occur between applications on different 
devices. 
Examples of speciﬁcations that operate at the session layer are
I
AppleTalk’s Zone Information Protocol (ZIP)
I
DECnet’s Session Control Protocol (SCP)

H.245, H.225

OSI Model Overview     587
Presentation Layer (OSI Layer 6)
The presentation layer provides application layer entities with services to ensure information is 
preserved during transfer. Knowledge of the syntax selected at the application layer allows selection 
of compatible transfer syntax if a change is required. This layer provides conversion of character-
representation formats as might be required for reliable transfer. Voice coding schemes are speciﬁed 
at this layer.
An example of a speciﬁcation that operates at the presentation layer is Abstract Syntax 
Notation 1 (ASN.1)
Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)
The application layer provides the user or operating system access to the network services. It 
interacts with software applications by identifying communication resources, determining network 
availability, and distributing information services. It also provides synchronization between the peer 
applications residing on separate systems.
Examples of application layer speciﬁcations are
I
Telnet
I
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
I
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
I
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

Example of Layered Communication
Suppose that you use a Telnet application. Telnet maps into the top three layers of the OSI model. 
In Figure B-3, a user on Host 1 enables the Telnet application to access a remote host (Host 2). The 
Telnet application provides a user interface (application layer) to network services. As deﬁned in 
RFC 854, ASCII is the default code format. There is no session layer deﬁned for Telnet (not an OSI 
protocol). Per the RFC, Telnet uses TCP for connectivity (transport layer). The TCP segment is 
placed into an IP packet (network layer) with a destination IP address of Host 2. The IP packet 
is placed into an Ethernet frame (data link layer), which is converted into bits and sent onto the wire 
(physical layer).

588     Appendix B: The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion
Figure B-3
Telnet Example
When the frame arrives at Router 1, it converts the bits into a frame; removes the frame headers (data 
link); checks the destination IP address (network); places a serial link header to the packet, making 
it a serial frame; and forwards the frame to the serial link (data link), which sends it as bits.  
Router 2 receives the bits, converts to a frame; removes the serial encapsulation headers; checks the 
destination IP address (network); adds an Ethernet header to the packet, making it a frame; and 
places a frame on Ethernet 2 (data link). Host 2 receives bits (physical) from the Ethernet cable and 
converts the bits into a frame (data link). Then, the IP protocol is examined and the packet data is 
forwarded to TCP, which checks the segment number and for errors and then forwards the segment 
to TCP port 23 (Telnet), which is the application. 
Numeric Conversion
This section focuses on the techniques for converting between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal 
numbers. Although the exam might not have a speciﬁc question about converting a binary number 
to decimal, you need to know how to convert these numbers to do problems on the test. A diagram 
might show a Token Ring with a decimal number, but the routing information ﬁeld (RIF) might be 
shown as hexadecimal. An IP address could be shown as binary, as hexadecimal, or in traditional 
dotted-decimal format. Some show commands have output information in hexadecimal or binary 
formats.

Hexadecimal Numbers
The hexadecimal numeric system uses 16 digits, instead of 10 digits used by the decimal system. 
Table B-1 shows the hexadecimal digits and their decimal equivalent values.
Hexadecimal Representation
It is common to represent a hexadecimal number with “0x” before the number so that it is not con-
fused with a decimal number. The hexadecimal number of decimal 16 is written as 0x10, not 10. 
Another method is to put a subscript h to the right on the number, such as 10h. It is also common to 
use the term hex when speaking of hexadecimal. Much of the text that follows uses hex.

Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal
First things ﬁrst: memorize Table B-1. For larger numbers, there are two methods. The ﬁrst method 
is to convert decimal to binary and then from binary to hex. The second method is to divide the 
decimal number by 16—the residual is the rightmost hexadecimal digit—and then keep dividing 
until the number is not divisible anymore. For the ﬁrst method, use the schemes described in later 
sections. For the second method, follow the examples described here. 
First, divide the decimal number by 16. The remainder of the division is the least signiﬁcant (ﬁrst) 
hexadecimal digit. Continue to divide the quotients (answer) of the divisions by 16 until the quotient 
is 0. The remainder value of each later division is converted to a hexadecimal digit and prepended 
to the previous value. The ﬁnal remainder is the most signiﬁcant digit of the hexadecimal equivalent. 
For large numbers, you might have to divide many times, This process will be clearer in the 
following examples.
Conversion Example B-1: Convert 26 to Its Hex Equivalent
Conversion Example B-2: Convert 96 to Its Hex Equivalent
Divide by 16:

Numeric Conversion     591
Conversion Example B-3: Convert 375 to Its Hex Equivalent
Conversion Example B-4: Convert 218 to Its Hex Equivalent
Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal
To convert a hex number to decimal, take the rightmost digit and convert it to decimal (for example, 
0xC = 12). Then, add this number to the second rightmost digit * 16 and third rightmost digit * 256. 
Don’t expect to convert numbers larger than 255 on the CCDA exam because the upper limit of IP 
addresses in dotted-decimal format is 255 (although Token Ring numbers do reach 4096). Some 
examples follow.
Divide by 16 first:

Now divide 23 by 16:

Now take the residual from the first division (7) and concatentate it 
with the residual from the second division (7), plus the result of the 
second division (1), and the answer is 177h.
Divide by 16:
  13 = Dh

Conversion Example B-8: Convert 1DAh to Decimal
Alternative Method to Convert from Hex to Decimal
Another way is to just convert from hex to binary and then binary to decimal. Conversion from 
binary to decimal follows.
Binary Numbers
The binary number system uses two digits: 1 and 0. Computer systems use binary numbers. IP 
addresses and MAC addresses are represented by binary numbers. The number of binary 1s or 0s is 
the number of bits, short for binary digits. For example, 01101010 is a binary number with 8 bits. 
An IP address has 32 bits, and a MAC address has 48 bits. As shown in Table B-2, IP addresses are 
usually represented in dotted-decimal format; therefore, it is helpful to know how to convert 
1 x 256 = 256
7 x   16 = 112
7 x     1 =     7
375d
6 x 16 =   96
0 x   1 =     0

numbers; therefore, it is helpful to know how to convert between binary and hexadecimal numbers.
The CCDA candidate should memorize Table B-3, which shows numbers from 0 to 16 in decimal, 
binary, and hexadecimal formats.

Converting Binary to Hexadecimal
To convert binary numbers to hex, group the bits into groups of four, starting with the right-justiﬁed 
bits. Groups of four bits are often called nibbles. Each nibble can be represented by a single 
hexadecimal digit. A group of two nibbles is an octet, 8 bits. Examples follow.
Conversion Example B-9: Convert 0010011101 to Hex
Conversion Example B-10: Convert 0010101001011001000010110001 to Hex
Converting Hexadecimal to Binary
This procedure is also easy. Simply change the hex digits into their 4-bit equivalent. Examples 
follow.
Conversion Example B-11: Convert 0DEAD0 into Hex
Conversion Example B-12: Convert AA0101 into Hex
Converting Binary to Decimal
To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each instance of 0 or 1 by the power of 2 associated 
with the position of the bit in the binary number. The ﬁrst bit, starting from the right, is associated 
with 20 = 1. The value of the exponent increases by 1 as each bit is processed, working leftward. As

Numeric Conversion     595
shown in Table 2-4, each bit in the binary number 10101010 has a decimal equivalent from 0 to 128 
based on the value of the bit multiplied by a power of 2 associated with the bit position. It is similar 
to decimal numbers where the numbers are based on powers of 10: 1s, 10s, 100s, and so on. In 
decimal, the number 111 is (1*100) + (1*10) + (1*1). In binary, the number 11111111 is the sum 
of (1*27) + (1*26) + (1*25) + (1*24) + (1*23) + (1*22) + (1*21) + (1*20) = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 
+ 4 + 2 + 1 = 255. For 10101010, the result is 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 170. Examples 
follow.

Conversion Example B-14: Convert 11011 to Decimal
Conversion Example B-15: Convert 11111111 to Decimal
Converting Decimal to Binary Numbers
This procedure is similar to converting from hex to decimal (by dividing), but now you divide the 
decimal number by 2. You use each residual to build the binary number, by prepending each residual 
bit to the previous bit starting with the right. Repeat the procedure until you cannot divide anymore. 
The only problem is that for large numbers, you might have to divide many times. The number 
of divisions can be reduced by ﬁrst converting the decimal value to a hexadecimal value and then

converting the intermediate result to binary representation. After the following example, you will 
ﬁnd an alternate method suitable for use with decimal values between 0 and 255 that can be 
represented in a single octet.
Conversion Example B-16: Convert 26 to Binary
Alternative Method
The dividing procedure described earlier works; it just takes a lot of time. Another way is to remem-
ber the bit position values within a byte—128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1—and play with the bits until the 
sum adds up to the desired number. This method works when converting integer values between 0 
and 255 inclusive. Table B-5 shows these binary numbers and their decimal value.

 Answer: 11010

Numeric Conversion     597
For example, to convert 26, you know that it is a number smaller than 128, 64, and 32, so those three 
bits will be 0 (000?????). Now, you need to ﬁnd a combination from 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 that adds up 
to 26. This method involves using subtraction to compute the remaining number. Start with the 
largest number, and make the bit at 16 a 1 (0001????). The difference between 26 and 16 is 10 so 
what combination of 8, 4, 2, and 1 gives 10? (1010.) Therefore, the answer is 00011010. You might 
think this method involves too much guesswork, but it becomes second nature after some practice.

The number is larger than 128; enable that bit. [1???????]
How far is 137 from 128: 9; enable the remaining bits for a value of 9 [1???1001].
The answer is 10001001.
The number is larger than 128; enable that bit. [1???????]
Because 211–128 is greater than 64, enable that bit. [11??????] (Remember that 
11000000 = 192.)
Because 211–192=19, enable bits 16, 2, and 1. [11?1??11]
The answer is 11010011.

In addition to remembering the bit-position values (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), it helps to remember 
network subnet masks values. Remembering them makes it easier to ﬁgure out whether you need to 
enable a bit. Table B-6 summarizes the binary subnet mask numbers and their decimal values.

AAL
ATM Adaptation Layer. A service-dependent sublayer of the data link layer. The AAL 
accepts data from different applications and presents it to the ATM layer in the form of 48-byte ATM 
payload segments. AALs consist of two sublayers: CS and SAR. AALs differ on the basis of the 
source-destination timing used (CBR or VBR) and whether they are used for connection-oriented 
or connectionless mode data transfer. As of 2002, the four types of AAL recommended by the ITU-T 
are AAL1, AAL2, AAL3/4, and AAL5.
AAL1
ATM adaptation layer type 1. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. AAL1 is used 
for connection-oriented, delay-sensitive services requiring constant bit rates, such as uncompressed 
video and other isochronous trafﬁc.
AAL2
ATM adaptation layer type 2. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. AAL2 is used 
for connection-oriented services that support a variable bit rate, such as some isochronous video and 
voice trafﬁc.

ACELP     613

adaptation layers, recommended by the ITU-T. AAL3/4 supports both connectionless and 
connection-oriented links but is used primarily to transmit SMDS packets over ATM networks.
AAL5
ATM adaptation layer type 5. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. AAL5 
supports connection-oriented VBR services and is used predominantly for the transfer of classical 
IP over ATM and LANE trafﬁc. AAL5 uses SEAL and is the least complex of the current AAL 
recommendations. It offers low-bandwidth overhead and simpler processing requirements in 
exchange for reduced bandwidth capacity and error-recovery capability.
ABR
1. available bit rate. A quality of service (QoS) class deﬁned by the ATM Forum for ATM 
networks. ABR is used for connections that do not require timing relationships between source and 
destination. ABR provides no guarantees in terms of cell loss or delay, providing only best-effort 
service. Trafﬁc sources adjust their transmission rate in response to information they receive 
describing the network’s status and its capability to successfully deliver data. 2. Area Border Router. 
A router located on the border of one or more OSPF areas that connects those areas to the backbone 
network. ABRs are considered members of both the OSPF backbone and the attached areas. ABRs, 
therefore, maintain routing tables describing both the backbone topology and the topology of the 
other areas.

designed to take advantage of high-speed transmission media, such as E3, SONET, and T3.
ATM layer
The service-independent sublayer of the data link layer in an ATM network. The ATM 
layer receives the 48-byte payload segments from the AAL and attaches a 5-byte header to each,

You are designing a WAN solution for a customer that is setting up a small satellite ofﬁce in 
New York. The customer needs medium- to high-bandwidth access at this location for down-
loading constant data streams from the headquarters in Los Angeles. The satellite ofﬁce also 
needs to upload large amounts of data frequently to headquarters. The client is interested in 
a mature and time-tested WAN technology. Which WAN technology should you recommend?

Answer: Frame Relay. Frame Relay offers medium to high bandwidth in both directions and is 
readily available in almost all areas of the country. Frame Relay is also a mature technology. 
5.
Describe an ATM cell and explain why cells are well suited for the transmission of voice and 
video trafﬁc.
Answer: ATM cells consist of 53 octets, or bytes. The ﬁrst 5 bytes contain cell-header 
information, and the remaining 48 contain the payload (user information). Small, ﬁxed-length 
cells are well suited to transferring voice and video trafﬁc because such trafﬁc is intolerant of 
delays that result from waiting in the interface output queue while a large data packet is 
transferred.
6.
Describe the ISDN options of BRI and PRI, focusing on available bandwidth for each 
technology.
Answer: ISDN BRI offers two bearer (B) channels and a delta (D) channel. BRI B channels 
transmit data and operate at 64 Kbps. The BRI D channel handles signaling and operates at 16 
Kbps. BRI also provides for framing control and other overhead, thus bringing the total bit rate 
to 192 Kbps. In North America and Japan, PRI ISDN over T1 media provides 23 B channels 
and 1 D channel. Unlike BRI, the D channel in PRI operates at 64 Kbps as well, bringing the 
total bit rate to 1.544 Mbps. In Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world, PRI is provi-
sioned over E1 media and features 30 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel for a total bit rate 
of 2.048 Mbps.

What is the purpose of FECN and BECN within Frame Relay technology?
Answer: Frame Relay reduces network overhead by implementing simple congestion-
notiﬁcation mechanisms rather than explicit, per-virtual-circuit ﬂow control. The congestion-
notiﬁcation mechanisms are called FECNs and BECNs, or forward explicit congestion 
notiﬁcations and backward explicit congestion notiﬁcations. 
8.
What is the most common type of virtual circuit used with Frame Relay? With X.25?
Answer: Frame Relay – PVC; X.25 - SVC.
9.
What is the basic Layer 2 technology behind MPLS encapsulation?
Answer: MPLS functions by “tagging” or “labeling” packets as they arrive at the service 
provider network. Core routers then forward the trafﬁc appropriately using QoS, trafﬁc 
engineering, or security mechanisms as required by the trafﬁc. 
10.
What is the purpose of the ELSR in MPLS technology?
Answer: Edge Label Switch Routers are located at the ingress point of service provider 
networks and are responsible for applying (removing) label information from incoming 
(outgoing) packets.

b. Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of customer requirements, the 
characterization of the existing network, and the design of the new WAN topology.
2.
f. The most popular DSL option, ADSL, is asymmetric. It allows more bandwidth 
downstream—from a Network Service Provider’s (NSP’s) central ofﬁce to the customer site—
than upstream from the subscriber to the central ofﬁce.
3.
c. Jitter is a measure of the deviation in delay experienced in a network. Designers often 
scrutinize this measurement in voice and video networks because they tend to be intolerant of 
jitter when this value is excessive.
4.
c. Cisco recommends that designers avoid compression usage if network-equipment CPU 
utilization levels are at 65 percent or greater.
5.
c. Larger window sizes allow network equipment to send more data prior to receiving an 
acknowledgement from the destination system. This has the potential to improve the 
performance of WAN connections.

a. Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression reduces the size of the TCP/IP headers to as few 
as three bytes.
7.
c. Designers do not require queuing services within WAN designs if links are never congested. 
If WAN links consistently demonstrate congestion, queuing is not the answer; an upgrade is 
more appropriate.
8.
b. PQ allows designers to give higher priority to certain types of time-sensitive or mission-
critical protocols. PQ establishes four interface output queues. The designer assigns each queue 
a priority and deﬁnes trafﬁc types for each queue. PQ then services all trafﬁc in higher-priority 
queues prior to servicing the lower-priority queues. 
9.
d. CQ establishes up to 16 interface output queues. CQ cycles through each queue to send some 
data, sending the amount from each queue speciﬁed by the designer. 
10.
a. Trafﬁc shaping delays excess packets by holding them in buffers and then releasing them at 
preconﬁgured rates.
Q&A
1.
Describe the Cisco recommended process for designing a WAN solution. 
Answer: Cisco recommends that designers engage in the analysis of customer requirements, 
the characterization of the existing network, and the design of the new WAN topology as a 
simple process for designing WAN solutions.
2.
Name three common design factors for creating WAN solutions.
Answer: Cisco identiﬁes the following design factors: application access, technology, and cost.
3.
Describe the options for WAN media and equipment ownership. 
Answer: WAN ownership falls into three broad categories, private, leased, and shared. With 
privately owned WAN designs, organizations must purchase all of the physical layer media 
(copper, ﬁber, wireless, coaxial) and the terminal equipment that connects it. Leased WAN 
arrangements involve dedicated bandwidth leased to the organization by a service provider. 
With shared WAN access, many companies share the bandwidth that the provider has available.

Company Adds Sites C and D
Answer the following questions.
21.
What options does the company have to connect Site C to Site D?
Answer: Implement dual-stack backbone or implement IPv4 tunnels between the sites.
22.
What mechanism needs to be implemented so that IPv6 hosts can communicate with IPv4 hosts 
and vice versa?
Answer: NAT-PT is required to provide network address translation and protocol translation 
between IPv6 and IPv4 hosts.
23.
If the company uses RFC 1918 addresses in its IPv4 network, what IPv6 addresses should it use 
at the new sites?
Answer: The company is using IPv4 private addresses in its existing IPv4 network. Site-local 
addresses are the IPv6 equivalent to IPv4 private addresses. The company should implement 
IPv6 site-local addresses.
24.
If a dual-stack backbone is implemented, do all WAN routers and all hosts need an IPv6-IPv4 
dual stack?
Answer: If a dual-stack backbone is implemented, only the WAN routers require a IPv6-IPv4 
dual stack. End hosts do not need a dual stack.

25.
If a IPv4 tunnel is implemented between Sites C and D, do all WAN routers require an IPv6-
IPv4 dual stack?
Answer: No, all WAN routers still run the IPv4 stack with two exceptions: the WAN routers at 
Site C and Site D. These routers speak IPv6 within their sites and IPv4 to the WAN.

The OSI Reference Model and 
Numeric Conversion
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a mandatory topic in any internetworking 
book. The CCDA candidate needs to understand the OSI model and identify which OSI layers 
host the different networking protocols. This appendix provides an overview and general 
understanding of the OSI reference model.
Also covered in this appendix is the numeric conversion of binary, decimal, and hexadecimal 
numbers. Quickly converting these numbers will help you answer test questions.
OSI Model Overview
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the OSI model in 1984, 
and revisited it in 1994, to coordinate standards development for interconnected information-
processing systems. The model describes seven layers that start with the physical connection 
and end with the application. As shown in Figure 2-1, the seven layers are physical, data link, 
network, transport, session, presentation, and application.
Figure B-1
Seven-Layer OSI Model
The OSI model divides the tasks involved in moving data into seven smaller, more manageable 
layers. Each layer provides services to the layer above, performs at least the functions speciﬁed 
by the model, and expects the deﬁned services from the layer below. The model does not deﬁne

the precise nature of the interface between layers or the protocol used between peers at the same 
layer in different instantiations of a protocol stack. The design of the model encourages each layer 
to be implemented independently. For example, you can run an application over IP (Layer 3), Ether-
net (Layer 2), Frame Relay (Layer 2), or Gigabit Ethernet (Layer 2). As the packets route through 
the Internet, the Layer 2 media changes independently from the upper-layer protocols. The OSI 
model helps standardize discussion of the design and construction of networks for developers and 
hardware manufacturers. It also provides network engineers and analysts with a framework useful 
in understanding internetworking.
Layered implementations of internetworking technologies do not necessarily map directly to the 
OSI model. For example, the TCP/IP architecture model describes only four layers, with the upper 
layer mapping to the three upper layers of the OSI model (application, presentation, and session). 
The development of IP predates the OSI model. For a more thorough discussion of the TCP/IP 
model, see Chapter 9, “Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4).” 
The following sections provide a description and sample protocols for each OSI layer.
Physical Layer (OSI Layer 1)
The physical layer describes the transportation of raw bits over physical media. It deﬁnes signaling 
speciﬁcations and media types and interfaces. It also describes voltage levels, physical data rates, 
and maximum transmission distances. In summary, it deals with the electrical, mechanical, 
functional, and procedural speciﬁcations for links between networked systems.
Examples of physical layer speciﬁcations are

Interface (FDDI)
Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)
This layer is concerned with the reliable transport of data across a physical link. Data at this layer 
is formatted into frames. Data link speciﬁcations include frame sequencing, ﬂow control, synchro-
nization, error notiﬁcation, physical network topology, and physical addressing. This layer converts 

OSI Model Overview     585
frames into bits when sending information and converts bits into frames when receiving information 
from the physical media. Bridges and switches operate in the data link layer.
Because of the complexity of this OSI layer, the IEEE subdivides the data link layer into three sub-
layers for LANs. Figure 2-2 shows how Layer 2 is subdivided. The upper layer is the logical link 
sublayer, which manages the communications between devices. The bridging layer, deﬁned by 
IEEE 802.1, is the middle layer. The lowest layer is the MAC sublayer, which manages the protocol 
access to the physical layer and ultimately the actual media. Systems attached to a common data link 
layer have a unique address on that data link layer.

Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)
The network layer is concerned with routing information and methods to determine paths to a 
destination. Information at this layer is called packets. Speciﬁcations include routing protocols, 
logical network addressing, and packet fragmentation. Routers operate in this layer. 
Examples of network layer speciﬁcations are

— Intermediate System–to-Intermediate System (IS-IS)
— Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP)
Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)
The transport layer provides reliable, transparent transport of data segments from upper layers. It 
provides end-to-end error checking and recovery, multiplexing, virtual circuit management, and 
ﬂow control. Messages are assigned a sequence number at the transmission end. At the receiving 
end, the packets are reassembled, checked for errors, and acknowledged. Flow control manages the 
data transmission to ensure that the transmitting device does not send more data than the receiving 
device can process.
Examples of transport layer speciﬁcations are
I
TCP
I
Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
I
Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX)
I
AppleTalk’s Transaction Protocol (ATP)
I
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
Session Layer (OSI Layer 5)
The session layer provides a control structure for communication between applications. It 
establishes, manages, and terminates communication connections called sessions. Communication 
sessions consist of service requests and responses that occur between applications on different 
devices. 
Examples of speciﬁcations that operate at the session layer are
I
AppleTalk’s Zone Information Protocol (ZIP)
I
DECnet’s Session Control Protocol (SCP)

OSI Model Overview     587
Presentation Layer (OSI Layer 6)
The presentation layer provides application layer entities with services to ensure information is 
preserved during transfer. Knowledge of the syntax selected at the application layer allows selection 
of compatible transfer syntax if a change is required. This layer provides conversion of character-
representation formats as might be required for reliable transfer. Voice coding schemes are speciﬁed 
at this layer.
An example of a speciﬁcation that operates at the presentation layer is Abstract Syntax 
Notation 1 (ASN.1)
Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)
The application layer provides the user or operating system access to the network services. It 
interacts with software applications by identifying communication resources, determining network 
availability, and distributing information services. It also provides synchronization between the peer 
applications residing on separate systems.
Examples of application layer speciﬁcations are
I
Telnet
I
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
I
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
I
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
I
Network File System (NFS)
I
Association Control Service Element (ACSE)
Example of Layered Communication
Suppose that you use a Telnet application. Telnet maps into the top three layers of the OSI model. 
In Figure B-3, a user on Host 1 enables the Telnet application to access a remote host (Host 2). The 
Telnet application provides a user interface (application layer) to network services. As deﬁned in 
RFC 854, ASCII is the default code format. There is no session layer deﬁned for Telnet (not an OSI 
protocol). Per the RFC, Telnet uses TCP for connectivity (transport layer). The TCP segment is 
placed into an IP packet (network layer) with a destination IP address of Host 2. The IP packet 
is placed into an Ethernet frame (data link layer), which is converted into bits and sent onto the wire 
(physical layer).

588     Appendix B: The OSI Reference Model and Numeric Conversion
Figure B-3
Telnet Example
When the frame arrives at Router 1, it converts the bits into a frame; removes the frame headers (data 
link); checks the destination IP address (network); places a serial link header to the packet, making 
it a serial frame; and forwards the frame to the serial link (data link), which sends it as bits.  
Router 2 receives the bits, converts to a frame; removes the serial encapsulation headers; checks the 
destination IP address (network); adds an Ethernet header to the packet, making it a frame; and 
places a frame on Ethernet 2 (data link). Host 2 receives bits (physical) from the Ethernet cable and 
converts the bits into a frame (data link). Then, the IP protocol is examined and the packet data is 
forwarded to TCP, which checks the segment number and for errors and then forwards the segment 
to TCP port 23 (Telnet), which is the application. 
Numeric Conversion
This section focuses on the techniques for converting between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal 
numbers. Although the exam might not have a speciﬁc question about converting a binary number 
to decimal, you need to know how to convert these numbers to do problems on the test. A diagram 
might show a Token Ring with a decimal number, but the routing information ﬁeld (RIF) might be 
shown as hexadecimal. An IP address could be shown as binary, as hexadecimal, or in traditional 
dotted-decimal format. Some show commands have output information in hexadecimal or binary 
formats.

Numeric Conversion     589
Hexadecimal Numbers
The hexadecimal numeric system uses 16 digits, instead of 10 digits used by the decimal system. 
Table B-1 shows the hexadecimal digits and their decimal equivalent values.
Hexadecimal Representation
It is common to represent a hexadecimal number with “0x” before the number so that it is not con-
fused with a decimal number. The hexadecimal number of decimal 16 is written as 0x10, not 10. 
Another method is to put a subscript h to the right on the number, such as 10h. It is also common to 
use the term hex when speaking of hexadecimal. Much of the text that follows uses hex.

Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal
First things ﬁrst: memorize Table B-1. For larger numbers, there are two methods. The ﬁrst method 
is to convert decimal to binary and then from binary to hex. The second method is to divide the 
decimal number by 16—the residual is the rightmost hexadecimal digit—and then keep dividing 
until the number is not divisible anymore. For the ﬁrst method, use the schemes described in later 
sections. For the second method, follow the examples described here. 
First, divide the decimal number by 16. The remainder of the division is the least signiﬁcant (ﬁrst) 
hexadecimal digit. Continue to divide the quotients (answer) of the divisions by 16 until the quotient 
is 0. The remainder value of each later division is converted to a hexadecimal digit and prepended 
to the previous value. The ﬁnal remainder is the most signiﬁcant digit of the hexadecimal equivalent. 
For large numbers, you might have to divide many times, This process will be clearer in the 
following examples.
Conversion Example B-1: Convert 26 to Its Hex Equivalent
Conversion Example B-2: Convert 96 to Its Hex Equivalent
Divide by 16:

Numeric Conversion     591
Conversion Example B-3: Convert 375 to Its Hex Equivalent
Conversion Example B-4: Convert 218 to Its Hex Equivalent
Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal
To convert a hex number to decimal, take the rightmost digit and convert it to decimal (for example, 
0xC = 12). Then, add this number to the second rightmost digit * 16 and third rightmost digit * 256. 
Don’t expect to convert numbers larger than 255 on the CCDA exam because the upper limit of IP 
addresses in dotted-decimal format is 255 (although Token Ring numbers do reach 4096). Some 
examples follow.
Divide by 16 first:

Now divide 23 by 16:

Now take the residual from the first division (7) and concatentate it 
with the residual from the second division (7), plus the result of the 
second division (1), and the answer is 177h.

Conversion Example B-8: Convert 1DAh to Decimal
Alternative Method to Convert from Hex to Decimal
Another way is to just convert from hex to binary and then binary to decimal. Conversion from 
binary to decimal follows.
Binary Numbers
The binary number system uses two digits: 1 and 0. Computer systems use binary numbers. IP 
addresses and MAC addresses are represented by binary numbers. The number of binary 1s or 0s is 
the number of bits, short for binary digits. For example, 01101010 is a binary number with 8 bits. 
An IP address has 32 bits, and a MAC address has 48 bits. As shown in Table B-2, IP addresses are 
usually represented in dotted-decimal format; therefore, it is helpful to know how to convert 
1 x 256 = 256
7 x   16 = 112
7 x     1 =     7

Converting Binary to Hexadecimal
To convert binary numbers to hex, group the bits into groups of four, starting with the right-justiﬁed 
bits. Groups of four bits are often called nibbles. Each nibble can be represented by a single 
hexadecimal digit. A group of two nibbles is an octet, 8 bits. Examples follow.
Conversion Example B-9: Convert 0010011101 to Hex
Conversion Example B-10: Convert 0010101001011001000010110001 to Hex

This procedure is also easy. Simply change the hex digits into their 4-bit equivalent. Examples 
follow.

Converting Binary to Decimal
To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each instance of 0 or 1 by the power of 2 associated 
with the position of the bit in the binary number. The ﬁrst bit, starting from the right, is associated 
with 20 = 1. The value of the exponent increases by 1 as each bit is processed, working leftward. As

shown in Table 2-4, each bit in the binary number 10101010 has a decimal equivalent from 0 to 128 
based on the value of the bit multiplied by a power of 2 associated with the bit position. It is similar 
to decimal numbers where the numbers are based on powers of 10: 1s, 10s, 100s, and so on. In 
decimal, the number 111 is (1*100) + (1*10) + (1*1). In binary, the number 11111111 is the sum 
of (1*27) + (1*26) + (1*25) + (1*24) + (1*23) + (1*22) + (1*21) + (1*20) = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 
+ 4 + 2 + 1 = 255. For 10101010, the result is 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 170. Examples 
follow.

Conversion Example B-15: Convert 11111111 to Decimal
Converting Decimal to Binary Numbers
This procedure is similar to converting from hex to decimal (by dividing), but now you divide the 
decimal number by 2. You use each residual to build the binary number, by prepending each residual 
bit to the previous bit starting with the right. Repeat the procedure until you cannot divide anymore. 
The only problem is that for large numbers, you might have to divide many times. The number 
of divisions can be reduced by ﬁrst converting the decimal value to a hexadecimal value and then

converting the intermediate result to binary representation. After the following example, you will 
ﬁnd an alternate method suitable for use with decimal values between 0 and 255 that can be 
represented in a single octet.
Conversion Example B-16: Convert 26 to Binary
Alternative Method
The dividing procedure described earlier works; it just takes a lot of time. Another way is to remem-
ber the bit position values within a byte—128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1—and play with the bits until the 
sum adds up to the desired number. This method works when converting integer values between 0 
and 255 inclusive. Table B-5 shows these binary numbers and their decimal value.

 Answer: 11010

Numeric Conversion     597
For example, to convert 26, you know that it is a number smaller than 128, 64, and 32, so those three 
bits will be 0 (000?????). Now, you need to ﬁnd a combination from 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 that adds up 
to 26. This method involves using subtraction to compute the remaining number. Start with the 
largest number, and make the bit at 16 a 1 (0001????). The difference between 26 and 16 is 10 so 
what combination of 8, 4, 2, and 1 gives 10? (1010.) Therefore, the answer is 00011010. You might 
think this method involves too much guesswork, but it becomes second nature after some practice.

The number is larger than 128; enable that bit. [1???????]
How far is 137 from 128: 9; enable the remaining bits for a value of 9 [1???1001].
The answer is 10001001.
The number is larger than 128; enable that bit. [1???????]
Because 211–128 is greater than 64, enable that bit. [11??????] (Remember that 
11000000 = 192.)
Because 211–192=19, enable bits 16, 2, and 1. [11?1??11]
The answer is 11010011.

In addition to remembering the bit-position values (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), it helps to remember 
network subnet masks values. Remembering them makes it easier to ﬁgure out whether you need to 
enable a bit. Table B-6 summarizes the binary subnet mask numbers and their decimal values.

AAL
ATM Adaptation Layer. A service-dependent sublayer of the data link layer. The AAL 
accepts data from different applications and presents it to the ATM layer in the form of 48-byte ATM 
payload segments. AALs consist of two sublayers: CS and SAR. AALs differ on the basis of the 
source-destination timing used (CBR or VBR) and whether they are used for connection-oriented 
or connectionless mode data transfer. As of 2002, the four types of AAL recommended by the ITU-T 
are AAL1, AAL2, AAL3/4, and AAL5.
AAL1
ATM adaptation layer type 1. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. AAL1 is used 
for connection-oriented, delay-sensitive services requiring constant bit rates, such as uncompressed 
video and other isochronous trafﬁc.
AAL2
ATM adaptation layer type 2. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. AAL2 is used 
for connection-oriented services that support a variable bit rate, such as some isochronous video and 
voice trafﬁc.

ACELP     613
AAL3/4
ATM adaptation layer type 3/4. One of four AALs, merged from two initially distinct 
adaptation layers, recommended by the ITU-T. AAL3/4 supports both connectionless and 
connection-oriented links but is used primarily to transmit SMDS packets over ATM networks.
AAL5
ATM adaptation layer type 5. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. AAL5 
supports connection-oriented VBR services and is used predominantly for the transfer of classical 
IP over ATM and LANE trafﬁc. AAL5 uses SEAL and is the least complex of the current AAL 
recommendations. It offers low-bandwidth overhead and simpler processing requirements in 
exchange for reduced bandwidth capacity and error-recovery capability.
ABR
1. available bit rate. A quality of service (QoS) class deﬁned by the ATM Forum for ATM 
networks. ABR is used for connections that do not require timing relationships between source and 
destination. ABR provides no guarantees in terms of cell loss or delay, providing only best-effort 
service. Trafﬁc sources adjust their transmission rate in response to information they receive 
describing the network’s status and its capability to successfully deliver data. 2. Area Border Router. 
A router located on the border of one or more OSPF areas that connects those areas to the backbone 
network. ABRs are considered members of both the OSPF backbone and the attached areas. ABRs, 
therefore, maintain routing tables describing both the backbone topology and the topology of the 
other areas.

Application layer
 Layer 7 of the OSI reference model. This layer provides services to applica-
tion processes (such as e-mail, ﬁle transfer, and terminal emulation) that are outside the OSI model. 
The application layer identiﬁes and establishes the availability of intended communication partners 
(and the resources required to connect with them), synchronizes cooperating applications, and 
establishes an agreement on the procedures for error recovery and the control of data integrity.

Standard 8824.
ATM
Asynchronous Transfer Mode. The international standard for cell relay in which multiple 
service types (such as voice, video, or data) are conveyed in ﬁxed-length (53-byte) cells. Fixed-
length cells allow cell processing to occur in hardware, thereby reducing transit delays. ATM is 
designed to take advantage of high-speed transmission media, such as E3, SONET, and T3.
ATM layer
The service-independent sublayer of the data link layer in an ATM network. The ATM 
layer receives the 48-byte payload segments from the AAL and attaches a 5-byte header to each, 
producing standard 53-byte ATM cells. These cells are passed to the physical layer for transmission 
across the physical medium.
