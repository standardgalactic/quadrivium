On 
th
e

A lack of transportation limited movement in  
the past. The wheel got early civilizations rolling 
and hasn’t stopped since, as millions take the 
driver’s seat around the world’s highways and 
byways. From sailing the seas to soaring the 
skies, new modes of transportation have taken 
us farther, and sped us there faster. Our planet is 
now an entirely accessible world.

The last log had to  
be brought around  
to the front as the 
object moved forward.
People or animals pulled  
the object across the  
log rollers on ropes, and 
others pushed from behind.
Rolling along
Before wheels, if you wanted to move something 
enormous and heavy, you would need some logs and  
a lot of people. You’d place the logs on the ground,  
slide your object on top of them, and then get your  
friends to use the logs to roll it along. Or you could drag  
a sled. Either way, it was slow and exhausting!
Wheely useful
Watching log rollers 
in action, someone, 
somewhere, had a flash 
of inspiration: Wheels 
attached to axles would be 
so much better! 
The first wheels we 
know about were made 
5,000 years ago in 
Mesopotamia (modern-day 
Iraq) and Slovenia. They 
were attached to simple carts 
pulled by animals, while 
everyone had a nice rest.
Gears and coGs are  
used in machines to  
multiply force, and were first 
used in ancient Greece.

Stone wheels were used 
for grinding, but are too

Did you know?
The oldest wheels ever 
discovered are on a  
stone toy. It dates from  
5500 bce and was  
found in Turkey.
It takes far less  
energy to turn the axle 
than to turn the wheel.
Spectacular spokes
At first, wheels were solid disks 
of wood. They worked, but 
they were very heavy. Around 
2,000 bce, someone in western 
Siberia came up with the bright 
idea of using spokes inside the 
wheels to replace the solid wood. 
They were lighter and faster. 
Metal hubs used with greased axles 
made wheels turn even more smoothly.
The Americas
The wheel wasn’t big in the 
Americas—the only ones found 
there are on children’s toys. This 
is probably because there were no 
animals strong enough to pull carts, 
like oxen or horses. The people there 
had to wait until these animals, and 
the wheel, were introduced to them in 
the 16th century. Until then, the most 
useful animal they had was the llama. 
Spinning wheelS, used to turn 
plant material or wool into 
thread, are probably an 
indian invention, from 
around the 11th century.
wheelS really began to 
motor from the 1700s, 
at first under steam 
power and later using 
gaSoline engineS.

Wheels allowed people  
to travel and trade much  
more easily than ever before, 
and a few thousand years later, 
wheels were moving faster 
and farther than ever thanks to 
the engine. Wheels are also 
the driving force behind 
countless useful machines.
By the way...
It was Neolithic (late Stone 
Age) people like me who first 
invented the wheel. We also 
invented farming and  
developed polished tools  
made of stone.

Caravel
The speedy SAILING SHIP that  
harnessed wind power to rule  
the waves
Setting sail
Caravels were invented just in time  
for Christopher Columbus—he sailed  
them across the Atlantic to the Caribbean 
in 1492. Not long after, EuropEan 
ExplorErs colonized the Americas, 
India, and Africa, and opened up new 
trade routes, changing the lives of  
many of the people who lived there.
Exploring the world
Ships with sails had been around 
for thousands of years, but caravels 
were the first to truly master the 
seas. Developed in the 1400s, they 
were light and fast, with lateen 
sails (triangular sails fixed to a 
sloping yardarm) that made them 
easier to maneuver than previous 
sailing ships. Caravels could sail 
long distanCEs, opening 
up new possibilities for 
intrepid explorers.
Henry the Navigator
The caravel was invented by Prince Henry of 
Portugal, known as Henry the Navigator, who 
founded a famous navigation sChool. 
But, despite his name, Henry never went on 
a voyage of discovery in one of his ships— 
in fact, he never went to sea at all.
Not much room for 
cargo—caravels 
were designed  
for exploration.
Lateen sails  
allowed the ship  
to “tack”—sail  
in zigzags into  
the wind.
European explorers  
used caravels to sail 
farther than ever before, 
discovering new lands  
and opening up new  
trade routes.

USS Holland carried 
three torpedoes for 
underwater warfare.
The Turtle  
was driven by  
hand-operated 
propellers.
Early subs
The world’s first submarine dived beneath the 
surface of the Thames River in London in 1624. It was 
powered by 12 oars, and its crew breathed oxygen 
produced by heating potassium nitrate. The first sub to 
be used in warfare was the Turtle (left). It was used 
in 1776 during the American Revolution. 
Battle stations
Submarines launched torpedoes that sank 
hundreds of ships in World War I, and they’ve 
been used in warfare ever since. Today, most 
naval submarines use nuclear power and can 
stay underwater for months at a time, lurking 
in the depths of the ocean. 
Holland’s submarine
Submarines wouldn’t have gone very far 
or very deep using manpower alone. In 
1881, Irish-American engineer J.p. Holland 
demonstrated a submarine called the Fenian 
Ram, which used an engine on the surface and 
a battery when it dived. Holland had invented the 
modern submarine, and supplied the us navy 
with its first ever sub, USS Holland, in 1900.

Sailors would be completely lost without 
these ingenious inventions. They have 
allowed explorers to travel the world  
and discover new lands.
Knowing WHERE YOU’RE GOING
Map
Simple maps of the heavens and of geographical 
features were carved onto cave walls thousands  
of years ago. Gradually, they became more detailed 
and useful. PTolemy, a Greek astronomer who 
lived in Egypt in the 2nd century, drew maps  
that included lines of longitude and latitude.  
His ideas revolutionized mapmaking when his 
maps were rediscovered by Europeans in the 
1400s. Their maps became much more accurate. 
As new lands were discovered, the modern  
world map took shape.
Compass
The Chinese were using compasses 
during the Qin dynaSTy (221–206 bce) 
to make sure that buildings were facing the 
right way for good fortune. The spoon-shaped 
needle was made from lodestone, a naturally 
magnetized mineral that always points toward 
magnetic north. Around the 11th century, 
compasses began to be used for navigation. 
Without navigational  
aids, sailors would  
rarely sail out of  
sight of land.

13
Marine sextant
Sextants (meaning sixths) use mirrors to 
measure the angle of the Sun or the North Star in 
relation to the horizon at particular times of day. 
Like the astrolabe, this allows sailors to work out 
their north–south position. The first one was 
made by English astronomer John Bird in 1757.  
They are still used today— 
if onboard computers 
crash, mariners can  
find their way 
with a sextant.
Mariner’s astrolabe
Sailors used astrolabes, first made around 1300, 
to measure the height of the sun or a particular star. 
This allowed them to calculate their latitude (north–
south position). Mariner’s astrolabes helped sailors 
explore faraway lands in a period known as 
the Age of Discovery, from the 1400s to the 1600s.
Satellite navigation
Today, there are networks of satellites in 
space that allow users to pinpoint their position 
almost anywhere on earth. A receiver compares 
time signals from four or more satellites. 
To determine its exact location, the receiver 
calculates the distance to each satellite. Today, 
most sailors rely on satellites to safely navigate 
through the world’s waters—and many cars and 
cell phones have satellite receivers, too.
Did you know?
Marshall Islanders memorized 
stick charts, made from 
coconut fronds, to map  
ocean swells and navigate  
the Pacific by canoe.

Steam engine
The DRIVING FORCE behind the machines 
that powered the Industrial Revolution
Explosive steam engines
The power of steam was first used to pump 
water out of mines, but the clunky engines 
tended to explode. Englishman Thomas 
Newcomen invented a more successful version  
in 1712, but it was still very inefficient. In the 
1770s, Scottish inventor James Watt improved 
the invention and made it much more efficient. 
Moving machines
Watt steamed ahead, continually 
improving his engine. It was used to pump 
water into canals and out of mines, drive 
bellows in ironworks, and power 
machiNes in textile mills. This rapid 
growth of industry was called 
the Industrial Revolution. 
3. Piston rod 
moves up and down, 
pushing on one end  
of a beam.
By the way...
My invention was a huge 
success in my lifetime and  
I died a wealthy man at the 
age of 83. A unit of  
power, the watt, is  
named after me. 
2. Cylinder contains 
a piston, which is 
pushed up and down by 
the steam, and pushes 
on the piston rod.
1. Tube allows steam 
from heated water into 
the engine’s cylinder.
5. Heavy flywheel 
prevents the engine from 
getting stuck at the top 
or the bottom of each 
up-and-down cycle.
4. Beam connnects  
to a second rod, which 
drives the gear wheel.
6. Gear wheel 
turns up-and-down 
motion into rotational 
motion, which can 
drive machinery.
The steam engine played  
an essential role in the 
Industrial Revolution. Millions 
of people moved from the 
countryside to work in  
city factories.

Steam 
locomotive
The engine that put transportation  
on the RIGHT TRACK
Building railroads
The new locomotives 
could now transport 
coal for the new steam-
powered machines, as well 
as the goods they made, and 
thousands of miles of railroad 
tracks began to be laid. The world’s 
first intercity railroad, between the British cities 
of Liverpool and Manchester, was built in 1830.
Locomotion
In 1801, British engineer Richard 
Trevithick invented a steam engine that 
changed everything. Using high-pressure 
steam, he built a steam-powered carriage, 
and then in 1808 the world’s first steam 
RailRoad locomoTive, Catch Me 
Who Can. It hauled 70 people and a load  
of coal along a railroad track.
Rocket hauled  
13 tons of loaded 
wagons to win the 
1829 competition.
The East and West Coasts  
of the United States were 
connected by the first 
transcontinental  
railroad in 1869.
Stephenson’s Rocket
After Trevithick’s locomotive, inventors 
got to work designing beTTeR ones. 
Rocket, designed by Robert Stephenson, 
won a competition to find the best of 
the bunch in 1829. It steamed into the 
history books at 30 mph (48 km/h).
Connecting rods driven 
by pistons turned the 
wheels and moved the 
engine forward.
Far faster and stronger 
than horses, steam 
locomotives triggered a 
transportation revolution 
that sped people and goods  
across the world.

Electric motor
Getting the modern world MOVING
Electric motors  
use magnetism to 
produce movement.  
Today, they are  
the driving force 
behind many 
everyday devices.
By the way...
I once started a small  
but alarming earthquake in  
the course of one of my 
experiments, and another  
time made terrifying  
artificial lightning!
The wire is coiled into 
eight electromagnets. 
Passing a current 
through the wire makes 
the central wheels turn.
Electric current 
provided by a battery 
travels through the wire.
Nikola Tesla was an 
American engineer who 
worked on a large number 
of different inventions 
during his lifetime.
Bowl of mercury
The electrified wire 
becomes magnetized,  
so it swings around  
the magnet in a circle.
Magnet
Faraday’s electrical 
experiments
English scientist Michael Faraday 
made the first electric motor  
in 1821 when he produced 
conTinuous moTion from 
electricity. It worked because 
passing an electric current 
through a wire produces 
magnetism. Later motors used 
electromagnets—coils of wire 
around an iron core—to make  
this effect stronger. 
Motoring on
German engineer moriTz Von Jacobi 
used electromagnets to make a motor 
powerful enough to be put to practical 
use. In a world first, an improved version of 
his motor drove a paddleboat across the 
Neva River in Russia in 1838 
with 14 people on board. 
Also in 1820, André-MArie 
AMpère worked out the 
relationship between the 
electromagnetic force and  
the electric current.

An outer set of 
electromagnets (called the 
stator) remains stationary.
Inside the stator, a moving 
set of electromagnets 
forms the rotor.
Tesla’s induction motor
Nikola Tesla invented the electric motors that 
power large machines today. His induction 
motor, invented in 1887, runs on alternating 
current (AC)—electric current that changes 
direction many times a second—rather than 
the direct current (DC) provided by a battery.
How it changed
the world
Electric motors took over 
from clunky steam engines  
to power machines. Now they 
also power the appliances  
we plug in and switch  
on every day.
The rotor can be 
attached to machinery, 
such as a fan or a 
conveyor belt.
Steam-powered washing 
machines were laundering 
clothes in the 1800s, but 
electric motors made  
them smaller and  
more convenient.
electric cars were first 
invented in the 19th 
century, but only now  
do they look set to rival  
gas-powered ones.

Motors that run on 
direct current have 
a permanent 
magnet and an 
electromagnetic rotor. 
The rotor’s north and south poles are 
attracted to the opposite poles of the 
permanent magnet, so the rotor moves 
half a turn. The direction of the current 
is then reversed, so the rotor moves 
another half-turn. Continually switching 
the current like this keeps the motor 
spinning. Motors that use AC work in a 
similar way, but they do not need a 
mechanism to reverse the current.

Bicycles started  
off without pedals, 
then got too big, 
but developed  
into the perfect 
way to travel.
Velocipedes
The world’s first bicycle was 
invented in 1818. Known as 
a velocipede, the wooden, 
iron-wheeled machine had 
a brake but no pedals— 
it had to be pushed along by 
the rider’s feet. The  
machine was popular, but 
only for a few months. 
Pedal power
The first successful pedal- 
driven bicycle was invented  
by Frenchman Pierre Lallement  
around 1864. People pedaled 
around quickly, but very 
uncomfortably. The bicycles 
became known as boneshakers 
because their heavy iron frames 
and iron-rimmed wheels shook 
over every bump and hole in the 
road—and back then there were 
a lot of BUMPs aNd Holes! 
The two-wheeled way  
to get people MOVING
German engineer 
Gottlieb Daimler designed 
the first two-wheeleD 
motorcycle in 1885,  
in order to test out  
a new engine.
bmX, short for bicycle 
motocross, began in  
the 1970s as a pedal-
power version of  
off-roaD motorcyclinG.
Bicycle
The rider sat  
high up over  
the large  
front wheel.
High-wheelers 
were also called 
penny-farthings, 
after two coins  
of different sizes.
Did you know?
Getting on a high-wheeler  
was difficult, stopping could  
be hazardous, and a pothole  
in the road often meant  
going headfirst over  
the handlebars. Ouch!
It paved the way for...

Before bicycles, you  
needed a horse if you 
wanted to get anywhere in  
a hurry. Bikes speed people 
to their destinations without 
anyone cleaning up after 
them. They convert human 
power into movement  
more efficiently than  
anything else. 
Safety bikes
Perilous penny-farthings were 
replaced by safety bicycles in  
the 1880s. They were driven by  
a rear-wheel chain, so the wheels 
could be of equal size. Things  
got even better for cyclists with  
the invention of air-filled tires, 
gears, safety reflectors, and 
generator-powered headlights.  
lighter and more  
efficient bicycle models 
continue to be developed.
Bicycle racing is a 
popular modern sport, 
with many different 
events for different types 
of bicycles raced over 
various distances.
the tandem is an  
unusual bicycle  
that allows two  
riders to sit one  
in front of the other  
and cycle simultaneously.
High-wheelers
Early bicycles were powered by  
the front wheel, so its size limited  
how fast they could go. Thrill-
seekers solved the problem by 
making bikes with enormous front 
wheels—some were 5 ft (1.5 m) 
across—and a much smaller rear 
wheel. Daredevil riders perched 
precariously over the front wheel 
and whizzed along at high 
speeds, to the alarm of passersby.

invention in front of  
an amazed audience  
at a fair in 1854.
The Archimedes screw was 
an ancient device used  
to lift water from one  
level to another. It was 
invented around the  
3rd century bce.
A hAnd-powered  
lifting device was  
invented by German 
engineer KonrAd Kyeser  
in the early 1400s.
Steam elevators
Until steam power gave 
everybody a much needed rest, 
the only way to lift something 
was for people or AnimAls 
to hoist it on ropes or carry  
it up stairs. One of the first 
steam elevators was used 
to haul blocks of ice from 
the Hudson River in New  
York State in 1754.
Safety hoist
Elevators were not used to lift people because of 
the risk of the rope snapping. American inventor 
elisHA GrAVes oTis solved the problem in 1853 
with his safety hoist. If the cable broke, the car still 
didn’t fall. The first passenger elevator, driven by 
steam power, was installed in a New York department 
store in 1857. It climbed five stories in one minute.
By the way...
In a dramatic display, 
I went up in an open-sided 
elevator, then had someone 
chop through the rope  
with an ax!

Hoisting rope pulls 
the elevator up and 
pulls the springs taut 
at the same time. If 
the rope breaks, the 
safety mechanism 
kicks in.
People and objects 
riding on the platform 
were safe at last.
Two sturdy springs on top  
of the lifting platform are 
kept taut by the rope,  
but get stuck in the metal 
teeth if the rope snaps.
A space elevator could one 
day be available to carry 
people into space without a 
rocket. The elevator would 
use a superstrong, superlight 
carbon-fiber cable.
Electrified elevators
Steam elevators puffed away until  
the 1880s when the first electric 
elevator was installed. Electric-
powered pulleys at the top of  
the shaft meant that elevators  
could climb highEr and  
fastEr than they had in the  
past. Elevators were developed to 
become automatic, with passengers 
able to call an elevator and specify  
a floor at the push of a button.
Skyscrapers
Now that people could scale  
tall buildings quickly and safely, 
skyscrapers began to reach higher 
and higher, transforming cities. 
Chicago’s Conway building, 
now known as the Burnham Center, 
is one example. When completed  
in 1913, it stood 300 ft (91 m) tall.

Around the Benz
In 1885, Karl Benz made his first automobile, which featured 
steel and wood panels for the body, and steel wheels 
covered in rubber. To demonstrate how well the new 
machine worked, his wife and business partner Bertha 
Benz took off on the world’s first long-distance car 
journey, a 124-mile (200 km) round trip. During the 
expedition, she used a hatpin to clear a fuel line, 
invented brake linings, and insulated a wire with her 
underwear. Everyone was amazed by her adventure, 
and the car Became a success.
Steaming along
The first automobile was steam-powered, built by 
Frenchman Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769. However,  
steam engines are huge, and German engine designer  
Karl Benz was convinced that smaller, more efficient 
internal combustion engines would do a better job.
Benz’s Patent 
Motorwagen No. 3 had 
three wheels and an 
engine in the rear.

Ford’s revolution
American inventor Henry Ford 
wanted to make cars cheap and easy 
to run, and earn lots of money in  
the process. He invented the first 
conveyor belt–based assembly 
line in 1913 at his car-manufacturing 
plant in Michigan, where his most 
famous car, the Model T, could be put 
together in just over 90 minutes. 
During the 20th century, other 
manufacturers copied Ford, and  
cars sold by the millions.
In an internal 
combustion 
engine, fuel 
burns 
(combusts) 
inside tubes called cylinders, 
producing hot gases that  
push pistons. The pistons turn a 
crankshaft that makes the car’s 
wheels move in a four-stroke 
cycle. The fuel in most engines 
these days is gasoline.

transportation. As a result, cities became bigger  
since people could live farther from work,  
though pollution from car exhaust fumes  
has meant that the environment  
has suffered.

Airplane
The first airplane blazed a trail

and helped make the world a

The Wrights’ flight
The American brothers Wilbur and 
Orville WrighT had been fascinated 
with flight ever since their dad gave them a 
toy flier. They studied gliders and built their 
own. But the Wrights’ glider had an extra 
element: an engine to propel it. In 1903, 
they made the world’s first powered flight.

Taking off
People had been trying to  
take to the skies for hundreds 
of years, with some even 
wearing feathers and  
leaping from high places. 
More successfully, the first 
hOT-air ballOOn went  
up in 1783, and the first 
passenger-carrying glider took 
off in 1849. But no one had 
mastered powered flight.
Igor SIkorSky designed  
the first successful  
modern helIcopter,  
which flew in 1939.
British engineer  
Frank Whittle invented 
the jet engIne in 1930.
Did you know?
The Wright brothers’  
first flight only lasted  
12 seconds and covered  
120 ft (36.5 m).
It paved the way for...
By the way...
My brother Orville  
flew the plane after my 
attempt stalled. We flipped  
a coin to see who would  
get the first try. 

25
Modern-day flying
The Wrights’ plane used a 
gasoline engine that turned 
propellers. The invention of 
more powerful jet engines—
usually situated on the wings—
made big, passenger-carrying 
aircraft possible. People 
could then jet off on 
flights to the other side  
of the world, reaching  
destinations that would have 
taken months by sea.
The Harrier Jump Jet 
was the first vertical 
takeoff plane. It first 
flew in 1966.
The plane’s weight must 
be counteracted by lift.
Drag 
reduces 
thrust.
Thrust propels the 
plane forward.
American astronaut  
Neil armstroNg stood  
on the Moon after 
rocketiNg iNto  
space in 1969. 
The Wright Flyer (as  
it came to be known) was 
made from spruce wood. 
Thrust from the engine drives 
the plane forward, and the 
plane’s shape lets air flow 
around it with minimum drag. 
The weight of the plane pulls it 
downward, and must be overcome by lift. This is 
provided by the way air moves around the wings. 
The invention of the airplane made 
traveling across the world a lot easier. 
Only four decades after the first 
powered flight, flying machines  
were blasting into space.

Leonardo’s aerial

Aerial screw
More than 400 years before the first  
helicopter flew, Italian genius Leonardo  
da Vinci drew plans for his “aerIal  
screw,” which was designed to be  
hand-powered by four pilots.  
It was never built, and 
modern scientists 
believe it would have 
been too heavy to 
get off the ground.
In 1907, Frenchman  
Paul Cornu’s helicopter  
rose 1 ft (30 cm) off  
the ground.
Autogyro
The autOgyrO was invented in 1923 by 
Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva. Like  
a helicopter, it has a spinning rotor that  
keeps it airborne. Unlike a helicopter, it  
is propelled by the engine, and not the  
rotors—which means it can’t do the  
tricks a helicopter can.
Another French 
inventor, EtiEnnE 
oEhmiChEn, created 
a helicopter 
that flew 3,280 ft 
(1 km) in 1924.
This rescue helicopter is 
designed to hold four 
crew members and up to 
six additional people.
Did you know?
Leonardo’s instructions  
stated that the aerial  
screw should be made of  
reed, wire, and linen  
for the sail.

27
Take off!
The first practical  
helicopter got off the  
ground in the early 1930s, 
but it was Russian-
American Igor Sikorsky’s 
VS-300 that today’s 
helicopters are based on.  
It used a large rotor  
on top for lift, and a tail  
rotor to keep it steady. It  
first flew in 1939, and was  
soon wowing onlookers.  
Its novel design meant  
that it could move in 
almost any direction 
(even upside down),  
and hover. 
  
Twin-rotor helicopters, such as 
Chinooks, were invented in the 
1960s by American Frank Piasecki.

create lift, was developed  
by Englishman Christopher 
Cockerell in 1956.

The amazing 
maneuverability of 
helicopters means they can 
do many things that planes 
can’t, making them ideal for 
difficult rescue missions, 
especially on mountains  
and at sea. They can  
also do some pretty  
amazing stunts! 
A helicopter’s main 
rotor blades provide 
lift. The pilot can move 
the aircraft up, down, 
backward, and  
forward by changing the rotors’  
speed and angle (via the swash plate 
assembly) in relation to the wind. 
Hovering happens when the lift from  
the rotor equals the pull of gravity.  
The tail rotor stops the helicopter  
from spinning, and controls the left  
and right movement of the craft.

The Mariner 2, launched by a

 The V-2 was the first 
ballistic missile. The first 
intercontinental ballistic 
missile, the soViet R-7, 
was launched in 1957.
We have liftoff!
To soar into the sky, a 
rocket needs enough fuel to 
lift its weight, have a safe way of burning 
that fuel very quickly, and be able to work 
in an airless environment if it gets to space. 
American scientist Robert Goddard was 
the first to solve these problems: He 
launched the world’s first liquid-fueled 
rocket in 1926. It was light, but packed 
enough punch to just about get it off the 
ground, though it didn’t reach space.
Wernher’s V-2
People realized that rockets could be used both to send 
humans into space and to fire weapons. German Wernher 
von Braun’s V-2 rocket was first used in 1944 during  
World War II. After Germany was defeated in the war, von 
Braun moved to the United States and pursued his  
dream of developing rockets for spaCe TRaVel.

Rockets have transported

and our place in it.
Soviet rockets
The Soviet Union (modern-day 
Russia and other Eastern European 
countries) blasted the first satellite into 
space in 1957 using the Sputnik rocket, 
designed by Sergey Korolev. Korolev 
also developed the Vostok rocket, 
which shot the first human being,  
Yuri Gagarin (left), into orbit in 1961. 
Man on the Moon
Soon after, in the United States, von Braun 
designed the Saturn v rocket (right) that 
took the first people to the Moon during 
the Apollo 11 mission. The rocket was  
363 ft (111 m) tall, but only the command 
module (the cabin for the astronauts) was 
designed to return to Earth. Most of the 
rocket consisted of tanks that housed the 
fuel needed to escape earth’s gravity. 
All rockets burn fuel, 
either solid or liquid,  
to provide thrust.  
V-2 rockets used 
liquid fuel and liquid 
oxygen. These are stored in big fuel 
tanks. They are mixed together in the 
combustion chamber and burned to 
become hot gas. The gas is then 
pushed out the back of the engine  
to drive the rocket forward.

the Sun a rocket goes, the less useful 
solar panels become, while traditional rocket 
fuels weigh a lot and run out quickly. Nuclear 
energy produces much more propulSioN

Atomic explorers
By 1900, scientists knew that everything 
is made from tiny particles called atoms. 
In 1909, New Zealand–born scientist 
Ernest Rutherford showed that atoms 
have a central nucleus, orbited by 
smaller particles called electrons. 
Later, discoveries by Rutherford and 
English physicist James Chadwick 
identified protons and neutrons, which 
make up the nucleus of an atom.
Nuclear fission
The powER of atoms was unleashed in 1938  
by scientists Lise meitner, otto Hahn, and fritz 
strassman: They split the nucleus of a uranium 
atom by firing neutrons at it. As the nucleus 
split, some of its mass was converted into heat,  
a process that became known as nuclear fission. 
Enrico Fermi, an Italian scientist living in the 
United States, headed the team that created the 
first controlled fission CHain REaCtion in  
the world’s first nuclear reactor.

When it first appeared around 2,000  
years ago, paper made writing  
and reading easier than ever before.
The write stuff
The very first Written Words  
were scratched onto clay slabs in ancient 
Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) more  
than 5,000 years ago. Later, people wrote  
on silk, bone, and bamboo in China, animal 
skin in Europe, and papyrus in Egypt. The 
Aztecs and Mayans in South and Central 
America wrote on a type of paper made  
from the bark of the amate tree. 
Helping people make their MARK
Invented around 1450 in 
Germany, the printing press 
eventually made books 
available to everyone.
The first paper money 
was used in China  
in the 800s, but 
didn’t reach Europe 
until the 1600s.
Paper
Chinese paper
Before paper was invented,  
people struggled with heavy books 
made of bamboo or spent fortunes 
on expensive silk. Legend has it that 
Chinese politician Ts’ai Lun revealed 
his papermaking technique to the 
emperor in 105 ce, but even older 
paper, from around 100 bce, has been 
discovered. It took hundreds of 
years for the secrets of papermaking 
to spread to other parts of Asia and 
North Africa, and more than 1,000 
years for it to reach Europe.
The pulp is spread  
over a wooden screen, 
resembling a flat,  
square sieve.
Plant fibers are cooked 
with lye (a cleaning agent) 
before being rinsed and 
beaten into a pulp.

Making paper 
The papermaking process hasn’t 
changed much since Ts’ai Lun’s  
time. Plant or textile fibers are still 
mashed up into a pulp, which is  
then sieved to create a wet sheet,  
and then pressed to dry it. The main 
difference is that machines do it for 
us these days—the first papermaking 
machine was invented in 1798. Also, 
in the 19th century, paper began to  
be made from wood pulp, which 
made it cheap enough to get  
almost everyone scribbling.
Tea bags first went on 
sale in 1903. At first, 
they were made from 
silk, but now they’re 
made from paper.
PaPer Tissues were made 
available in the 1920s  
and gradually replaced  
cloTh handkerchiefs.
The pulp is pressed to 
squeeze the water out, 
leaving a sheet of paper.
The paper is fully  
dried by hanging it  
up on a wall. 
Paper made information, stories, 
and ideas storable on a light, 
strong, cheap, and space-saving 
surface. Without it, the printing 
press would never have made 
books and reading so popular.
How it changed 
 the world
Did you know?
Ts’ai Lun’s discovery  
made him very famous and  
wealthy in China, and helped  
spread Chinese culture  
far and wide. 
By the way...
My special papermaking 
recipe included tree bark, 
fibers from the bamboo plant, 
some silk rags I had lying 
around, and even old  
fishing nets.

the Han Dynasty.

People in China were turning the pages of 
books printed using wooden Blocks

invented movable type—raised letters 
that could be moved into place and used 
to print more than one book. But the

Books were once an expensive 
rarity, but the printing press 
turned them into a means of 
spreading ideas and information 
far and wide.
Chinese printing
People in China were turning the 
pages of books printed using 
wooden blocks more than 1,000 
years ago. Later, they invented 
movable type – raised letters that 
could be moved into place and 
used to print more than one book. 
But the sheer number of 
characters in the Chinese
Impressive press
Around 1450, German publisher 
Johannes Gutenberg invented a printing 
press based on olive and wine presses. 
His mechanical movable type 
system used metal letters arranged 
as required and inked by hand. 
LowerinG the press pushed  
the paper onto the letters  
and the page was printed.
Printing today 
Within Gutenberg’s lifetime, his press 
produced books in cities all over 
Europe. He’d designed it so well 
that it hardly changed for the next 
300 years. Starting in the 1800s, steam-
powered presses churned out books 
more cheaply than ever before. Modern 
presses (above), powered by electricity, 
use rollers and print in coLor.
Before Gutenberg’s invention, books were 
rare and expensive because they had to be 
copied out by hand. The printing press 
meant that entire books could be printed 
cheaply and quickly, putting ideas and 
information into the hands of ordinary 
people, not just the very rich. Millions of 
people learned to read as a result and 
discovered the pleasure of a good book. 
PaPerback books were first 
mass-produced in the 
19th century on steam-
powered presses.
The first e-book readers 
were launched in 1998. 
E-books will soon overtake 
sales of physical books.

Communication problems
Long-distance communication took the 
form of smoke signals, beacons, or carrier 
pigeons until 1792, when a semaphore 
telegraph system was invented by 
Frenchman CLaude Chappe. It 
used pairs of movable arms on 
station buildings (above) 
to represent letters and 
numbers to signal to 
the next station in the 
chain, but it was slow 
and expensive to build.
Electric telegraphs
english inventors William Fothergill Cooke  
and Charles Wheatstone came up with the first 
electrical long-distance communication in 1837. 
Their teLegraph could send messages 
through an electric wire without having to be 
within sight of the person receiving it. 
Americans Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail later 
developed a code of dots and dashes that 
became the standard telegraph code.

Telegraph takeover
In 1866, Europe and North 
America were linked when the 
first transatlantic cables were 
laid. Telegraph wires reached 
Australia six years later, and 
telegraphs could be sent all 
around the world when cable 
was laid under the paCifiC 
OCean in 1902.
Wheatstone and Cooke’s 
telegraph used two rows  
of buttons to spell out  
a message to send. 
A grid of letters was 
used to spell out the 
messages received.
The telegraph made it 
possible to send almost-
instant messages across 
oceans and continents, 
starting a revolution  
in communication.

Braille
The key that unlocked the world of 
reading for MILLIONS of blind people
Louis’s alphabet
Braille was determined to find a better way 
to read. When he was just fifteen, he invented a 
system of raised dots arranged in rectangles, 
with different patterns for each letter. The Braille 
alphabet was simple to read and cheap to 
produce, and was soon transforming lives.
Louis Braille
Born in France in 1809, Louis BraiLLe  
was blinded in an accident when he was  
very young. At school, he wanted to read 
books, but there weren’t any for blind 
people. When he went to a special school  
for blind children in Paris at the age of 10, 
there were books with raised letters that  
could be read by touch, but there were only  
a few, and they were very hard to read.
How it works
Nearly 200 years after Braille came up with  
his alphabet, people are still using it, even  
with computers. Braille computer displays use 
electromechanically controlled pins to make 
Braille characters that can be touched. Research 
into how to make the Internet more accessible  
to blind people is underway, with Braille’s 
alphabet at the front of the new technology. 
By the way...
At school, I heard about a 
special way of communicating 
that could be read in the 
dark, which inspired me to 
come up with my alphabet.
Louis Braille was  
blinded after an accident 
in his father’s workshop 
when he was three.
Braille’s system opened  
the doors of literature  
and education for blind 
people—making it easier 
for them to live a  
happy and full life.

Sound signals
Thomas Edison, the famous American 
inventor, made an exciting discovery while 
working on a recorder for telegraph signals in 
1877. He realized that the indentations made by 
the signals produced sound when a needle 
ran back over them. So he went to work using 
cylinders wrapped in tinfoil, a metal disc, a handle, 
and a needle, and invented the phonograph,  
the first machine to record sound.
Spinning discs
Edison’s foil-wrapped cylinders were 
absolutely amazing, but they were a bit bulky, 
and could be played only a few times before decaying.  
In 1887, German-American inventor Emil Berliner  
invented a machine that traced sound grooves onto a  
flat disc instead of a cylinder. Many copies of the  
discs could be made—they were the first records.

that teaching would be a

Into the groove
As time passed, further 
improvements were  
made to both the records 
and the players. The 
grooves on records 
became thinner, so more 
sound could fit on each 
disc. Loudspeakers 
replaced the horns of the 
early phonographs to 
amplify the sound. With 
these improvements, records 
were finally sounding great, and 
people started collecting music 
from their favorite musicians. 
Incredible Edison
Although he ended up with more than a  
thousand inventions to his name, Edison considered  
the phonograph to be his favorite invention.  
He set up his own record label, edison records,  
to publish new recordings—first on cylinders,  
and later on discs. He continually improved  
the phonograph right up until his death in 1931.  
By the way...
I was very hard of  
hearing, which helped me  
concentrate—maybe  
that’s why I never  
invented a hearing aid!
When Edison spoke  
into the horn, the 
pressure of his  
voice caused the  
needle to scratch  
indentations into the tinfoil-coated  
cylinder as it rotated. When the 
needle was moved over the 
indentations it had scratched into the 
foil, it played back the sound of 
Edison’s voice through the horn, 
which magnified the sound.

Bell’s telephone
Seeking to improve the 
telegraph in 1875, Scottish 
inventor Alexander Graham 
Bell stumbled on a discovery of 
far greater importance: He 
realized that sounds could travel 
Along the telegrAph wires, 
and be heard in another room.  
Bell’s first message to his assistant 
Thomas Watson was “Mr. Watson,  
come here! I want to see you!” 
The telephone exchange meant 
that more than one phone 
could be connected along the 
same line, less than a year 
after the phone was invented. 
Did you know?
Bell also invented a metal 
detector, which he used to  
try to find a bullet inside  
President James A. Garfield  
after he was  
shot in 1881.
This version of Bell’s phone 
was made to demonstrate 
the invention to Queen 
Victoria of the UK in 1878.

Carbon

Early telephones used  
a thin metal disk that 
vibrated when someone 
spoke into the transmitter, 
making fluctuations in a 
layer of carbon granules. This varied the 
electric current, provided by a battery, which 
then traveled across the telephone line to  
the receiver. The electric current caused the 
carbon grains in the receiver to vibrate and 
copy the original sound.

Patent fight
Bell began working on his idea and patented it  
in 1876, since he knew other inventors were working  
on similar designs. His early phones featured a lever  
to call the other phone on the line, and a receiver 
that functioned as both an earpiece to hear the person  
on the other end and a mouthpiece to talk to them 
(though separate ear- and mouthpieces were soon 
developed). They were a roaring success. 
By the way...
I patented a device much like  
a telephone five years before 
Bell did. But I was too poor  
to pay the $10 fee to renew 
my patent, so I lost it.

1860 had demonstrated his 
“teletrofono,” which Bell had

HeinricH Hertz discovered 
radio waves in 1888, 
but he did not see  
their potential uses.
nikola tesla was the 
first to generate and 
transmit radio waves 
in 1895.

Marconi’s radio
Guglielmo Marconi, a 19-year-old Italian, was 
fascinated when he read about the discovery of 
radio waves by German scientist Henrich Hertz. 
Hertz showed that radio waves were a kind of 
energy, just like light, that traveled in waves and 
could be made to carry information. Many 
inventors were excited by this information. 
Marconi found that radio waves could be used to 
send Morse code through the air, without using 
wires. In 1897, he started his own company  
and began to develop his ideas further.

Saving lives
At first, Marconi’s “wireless telegraph” 
could send signals only a few miles,  
but his waves were beaming across the 
Atlantic Ocean by 1901. Soon, there  
were transmitters on both sides of the 
ocean, and wireless equipment on ships. 
When the Titanic struck an iceberg and 
began to sink in 1912, frantic calls for 
help from the radio operators on board 
the ship helped save 705 lives.
Marconi’s funeral in 1937 was 
marked by two minutes of silence 
on all radios across the world. 
Marconi’s 1902 magnetic 
detector radio used an 
iron-wire band wound 
around two pulleys to 
pick up signals. 

45
Radio voices 
The early radios transmitted Morse code 
only, which was picked up by radio 
operators and transcribed into messages. 
Canadian Reginald Fessenden made 
the first voice radio broadcast in 1906.  
The radio operators who tuned in  
couldn’t believe their ears when they 
heard a human voice coming through for 
the first time. Soon, families were gathering 
around the radio to be entertained by 
music, comedy, and drama.
 
 
The telegraph and 
telephone allowed people to 
communicate across long 
distances, but both required cables, 
which were often difficult (and 
sometimes impossible) to lay.  
The development of radio  
technology meant that people  
could communicate directly  
anywhere in the world,  
even at sea. 
We can watch television  
thanks to radio signals,  
which have been transmitting 
television broadcasts  
since the 1930s.

to obtain the photos.
Did you know?
Early daguerreotype  
sitters had to stay 
absolutely still for 60 to 90 
seconds. No wonder most  
of them looked so serious! 
Daguerreotype
The world’s first photographs were taken by 
Nicéphore Niépce, but they faded quickly.  
Fellow Frenchman Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre 
discovered a way of making a permanent image 
on a silver-coated copper plate. They didn’t take  
a long time to make, and the images can still be 
seen today. People rushed to have their portraits 
immortalized on daguerreotypes, as they 
were called, in the mid-1800s.
Film cameras
Photography was a complicated and 
time-consuming process before American 
George Eastman invented roll-film cameras. 
Eastman invented a flexible film to replace 
the glass plates that were commonly used to 
capture images, then, with William Walker, 
a roll holder for the film. His KodaK 
camera was the first to have a built-in 
film-roll holder when it went on sale in 
1888, making photography a lot simpler.

Digital camera
Digital photography is absolutely  
instant and doesn’t require film or 
processing. The Japanese company  
Sony sold the first commercial filmless 
camera in 1981. It used a disk  
drive to store video-camera images,  
but was otherwise like a normal camera.  
As technology got better and the cost  
of the components went down, the first 
digital cameras began to be sold. It wasn’t 
long before almost everyone was snap-
happy: Digital cameras allow you to take 
and save as many pictures as you want, 
printing out only your favorites.

Three-year-old Jennifer Land asked 
her father why a photo couldn’t be 
seen right after it was taken. The 
question led edwin Land to invent 
the Polaroid camera in 1947, which 
worked by using chemicals inside 
the camera to develop and print the 
image. For the first time, people could 
see their photos without having to 
send the film away to be developed.

From fuzzy pictures to

watching television has  
kept us informed and 
entertained for decades.
Baird’s biscuit-tin TV
In 1926, an excited audience in London, 
England, became the first people ever to 
watch television. Scottish inventor John 
Logie Baird had cobbled together a tea 
chest, biscuit tins, hat boxes, and darning  
needles to come up with a mechanical  
TV. The audience watched a scary-looking 
ventriloquist’s dummy named Stookie Bill.
Switching on
Although they were exciting, Baird’s 
television pictures were so Fuzzy 
that his system was soon abandoned. 
A few years later, Russian-American 
inventor Vladimir Zworykin improved 
the cathode-ray tube (a device for 
showing images on a screen), and 
used it in a new type of electrical TV. 
Sales had skyrocketed by the 1950s, 
with millions of people enjoying news 
and entertainment via the magic of 
moving pictures in their homes.

Digital TV
The television you turn on 
today probably uses digital 
technology and a flat liquid-
crystal display instead of a 
cathode ray tube. Digital TV 
means you can choose from 
many more TV channels, 
and watch your favorite shows 
in great detail thanks to high-
definition image technology. 
The first closeD-circuiT TV 
systems were developed in 
the 1940s—and are now 
used in many builDings.
In cathode-ray 
televisions, electron 
beams emerge from 
a cathode. 
Electromagnets 
controlled by the TV direct the electron 
across the screen to trace out a 
picture. Phosphors—substances that 
glow when the electron beams hit 
them—make the picture visible. 
Mixtures of red, green, and blue 
phosphors can make any other color.

Transistors take over
The trio’s small but revolutionary solution, 
called the transistor, could control 
electric current just like vacuum tubes did,  
but was an enormous improvement. The 
transistor used far less power, hardly ever 
failed, and was so tiny that it made it possible 
to have smaller electronic equipment.  
In 1956, Brattain, Bardeen, and Shockley  
were jointly awarded the nobel Prize for 
Physics for their work on transistors.
The COMPACT COMPONENT that 
made modern electronics possible
Transistor
Circuitry
Early transistors were about the length of the palm of  
your hand, but improvements to their design led them to 
become smaller. At first, they were connected to other 
electronic components on circuit boards, and used in 
hearing aids, radios, and computers. Now, transistors are 
mostly found in computer chips—hundreds of millions 
of transistors can fit on a single chip.
Vacuum tubes
Transistors are used in electronic 
equipment to switch or amplify 
electric signals. Before transistors, 
these jobs were done by vacuum 
tubes, which looked like light  
bulbs and were unreliable and 
bulky. American physicists William 
Shockley, Walter Brattain, and John 
Bardeen began developing ideas to 
rePlace them in the 1950s. 
Shockley 
worked for the 
US military during 
World War II.
The three leads allow 
the transistor to stop, 
start, or increase 
electrical current.
Brattain once said, 
“The only regret  
I have about the 
transistor is its use 
for rock and roll.” 
Bardeen went on to win 
a second Nobel Prize for 
Physics in 1972. 
Transistors made  
electronic equipment  
smaller and more reliable. 
Without them, the gadgets 
we use every day  
wouldn’t exist.

computer. Today’s microprocessors power computers, phones, washing 
machines, and much more. They’re thousands of times faster than the 
first ones, and yet they’re small enough to fit on a fingernail.
Microchips
Early computers relied on transistors and other electrical 
parts connected by hand. This was a laborious process, 
and if any one of these connections broke, the whole 
bunch could fail. In 1958, American scientist Jack Kilby 
developed the integrated circuit (left). By 1961, these were 
a lot smaller and commonly known as microchips. Each 
one consisted of hundreds of tiny parts, made from one 
piece of material (usually silicon). They made computer 
parts more reliable, organized, and consumed less power.
Intel labeled Hoff a  
“rock star” for his work  
on the microprocessor. 
The smallest wires in 
today’s microprocessors 
are less than one-
thousandth the  
width of a human hair.
Without microprocessors, 
we wouldn’t have personal 
computers, or any of the 
smart appliances that help 
run our lives.

The Intel 8080 was 
used in the first 
commerical computers.
Minicomputer
In 1971, fellow American Ted Hoff was  
designing a new microchip for a scientific 
calculator for the company Intel. He thought it  
would be easier to make a chip that could be used for 
a variety of functions, as opposed to one that would  
work only for his calculator. His solution was the 
Intel 4004 microprocessor, a minicomputer on a chip. 
Further improvements led to the Intel 8080 chip, which 
came to be known as “the first truly usable microprocessor.”

Programmed computers control 
industrial robots, which do all 
kinds of work too difficult or 
dangerous for humans, such  
as lifting heavy loads or 
performing intricate tasks.
The internet grew from a 
network of computers in  
the United States in the 
late 1960s, and the World 
Wide Web brought it to the 
masses in the 1990s.
Computer
The start of the INFORMATION AGE
From enormous  
“engines” to tiny devices 
that fit inside phones, 
computers have 
revolutionized our lives.
By the way...
“Ada Lovelace Day” is 
celebrated in the middle of 
October—its goal is to  
encourage more girls to  
study the sciences. 
Apple’s popular 
iMac computer was 
released in 1998. 
Engines 
Englishman Charles Babbage 
was way ahead of his time: 
He designed three computing 
machines in the 1820s and 
1830s, which he called 
“engines,” though he never 
managed to build these huge 
mechanical contraptions. English 
mathematician Ada Lovelace 
devised a sequence of operations 
intended to allow Babbage’s 
Analytical Engine to solve a  
math problem—making her the  
first computer programmer.

and the Internet. The most 
famous is FacEbook, started

Mark Zuckerberg.
The iMac featured a

in one colorful case.
Apple Macintosh
The early computers were the size of several elephants. 
Transistors and then microprocessors gradually made 
computers smaller and cheaper, but early computer users 
needed skill and specialized technical knowledge.  
In 1976, Americans Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs began  
to change that with their Apple computers, designed so 
that anyone could use them. Other companies soon 
followed, making computers cheaper, smaller, and easier 
to use. Soon, they were in schools, offices, and homes 
across the world, in technology as diverse as cell 
phones, cars, and even toilets. 
Secret computers
The world’s first working computers were both 
kept top secret. The first programmable computer 
was the Z3, invented by Konrad Zuse 
during World War II, and was used 
to make secret codes for 
Germany. Britain, Germany’s 
enemy in the war, built Colossus 
(right), the first digital electronic 
computer. Colossus enabled 
Britain and its allies to break 
the German codes, giving 
them access to top-secret 
German information.
How it changed
the world
Computers have revolutionized 
almost every part of modern life 
in some way—our workplaces, 
schools, and even our social 
lives, since they are in  
the things we use every day.

was rocketed into orbit by the Soviet Union 
in 1957. The country’s bitter rival, the 
United States, had been developing its 
own satellite and was furious to have lost 
the first episode of what became known as the 
Space Race. The first US satellite, ExplorEr 1, 
was launched just three months later.

Satellites allow  
us to communicate  
instantly. They also warn us 
about wild weather, keep us 
from getting lost, and—experts 
believe—help keep the  
world at peace.
Modern satellites
There are now thousands of artificial satellites 
in orbit above our heads, transmitting signals or 
taking pictures for use in communication, 
navigation, research, and even spying. We have 
also sent space probes into orbit around other 
bodies in our Solar System: They are now satellites 
of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, 
Saturn, and the Sun.
Satellites use radio 
waves to transmit 
information. 
Communications 
satellites receive  
a radio signal beamed up to them 
from Earth and transmit it to another 
point on Earth’s surface. In this 
way, a signal—such as a 
television broadcast—can be 
sent over a very long distance 
almost instantaneously.

Lippershey’s lenses
In 1608, German-Dutch spectacle 
maker Hans Lippershey combined 
curved lenses in a long tube to make 
the first teLescope, which 
magnified objects up to three times.  
He went on to make several telescopes 
for the Dutch government, and was 
paid very handsomely in return. 
Galileo
Italian scientist GaLiLeo GaLiLei improved 
Lippershey’s telescope in 1609 and turned it to the stars.  
His telescopes were able to make distant objects  
appear bigger, and gazing through them, he observed 
the craters of our Moon and four of Jupiter’s moons, 
identified the fuzzy Milky Way as vast numbers of distant 
stars, and even realized that the earth orbits the sun.
Galileo’s telescope used  
two lenses to make objects 
appear 30 times bigger.

A refracting telescope (like 
Lippershey’s and Galileo’s)  
is a tube with an objective  
lens at one end. Light from 
a distant object is bent as it 
passes through this lens and focused into a 
magnified image. An eyepiece lens at the 
other end of the tube then magnifies the 
image even further. Many telescopes, 
including Hubble, use mirrors to help collect 
light—these are called reflecting telescopes.

Since Galileo, there have been many 
developments in telescope technology, including

innovation is the launching of telescopes past the 
blurring effects of Earth’s atmosphere and into space. 
The most famous is the Hubble space Telescope.

precious information from space, and helped us

Internet
The network that connected the 
world’s computers, starting the 
INFORMATION REVOLUTION
Packet switching
ARPANET was a success, and it gradually spread 
outward to make a network of networks: what  
we now call the internet. In 1973, Cerf and  
Kahn developed a language, called TCP/IP, to 
help the Internet function better. It relies  
on “packet switching”: instead of sending 
data in one direction, through a central 
system, the data was split into  
chunks (or packets). Each 
packet found the most efficient 
way across the network to  
its destination, where the 
data was reassembled.
Sharing computers
In 1969, the Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (ARPA) launched an 
interconnected group of powerful 
computers, and called it ARPANET. 
This novel idea enabled scientists 
working anywhere in the United States 
to share these few computers without 
leaving their own place of work. 
Computer scientists Vint Cerf and Bob 
Kahn were two of the key experts 
working on the project in the 1970s.
Getting connected
Along with the invention of e-mail in 1972, TCP/IP 
allowed the Internet to really take off. It became the 
standard Internet language in 1983. Europe, via the 
Netherlands, became the first territory outside the  
US to connect to the Internet in 1989. By this time,  
there were less than 10 million computers connected  
to the Internet, but that was about to change. 
Computers connect 
to the Internet 
through an Internet 
Service Provider 
(ISP)’s computer.
The Internet means we 
always have information  
at our fingertips, and can 
share information and 
communicate whenever  
we want.

Tim Berners-Lee
The World Wide Web (WWW) was born at the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland 
in 1990. Projects at CERN created huge amounts of data 
that scientists around the world needed to access,  
so English physicist Tim Berners-Lee proposed an 
information system for CERN that used linked  
documents on Web pages accessible via the Internet.
Spreading the word
The world’s first website was set 
up by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN  
in 1990. The site showed how 
people could build their own 
websites, and Berners-Lee and his 
colleagues sent out software and 
spread the word as widely as 
they could, so that more sites 
soon appeared. As time has 
passed, websites have become 
more sophisticated, 
containing pictures, videos, 
sound, advertisements, and more. 
Free for all
CERN made the source code for the World 
Wide Web software available to everyone 
free of charge. Even today, anyone can 
run a website and access the web for 
nothing. Making the technology freely 
available was the key to its success. By 
1993, the World Wide Web was doubling 
in size every three months—there are more 
than 250 million sites on the web today.

Ancient toilets
Early toilets were basically open-air holes 
in the ground, such as this Roman lavatory 
from the 2nd century ce. Over the centuries, 
Sewage SyStemS developed for waste to  
flow into and be carried away. There were 
simple forms of the flush toilet in many 
ancient civilizations, including China, 
Egypt, Persia (modern-day 
Iran), and Greece.
Royal flush
Centuries passed and chamber pots were all 
the rage. A pot was placed under the bed for 
regular use, with the smelly contents often 
tossed out of the window! John harrington, 
godson to Queen Elizabeth I of England, invented a 
more advanced flushing toilet in the 1590s, which 
let water out of a tank and down a pipe to clean the 
bowl. He installed one for the queen, who wasn’t 
impressed, and the invention didn’t catch on. 
The first toilet paper went  
on sale in 1857, though  
the earliest use was 
probably in China during 
the 14th century.
The first public 
bathroom with flushing 
toilets opened in London in  
the 1850s. Today’s public toilets 
are usually housed in separate 
cubicles with locks.

Invented in 1870 by Stevens 
Hellyer, the Optimus was an 
advanced toilet design, with 
an under-the-rim flushing 
mechanism that was much 
more effective than 
previous versions.
Going around the bend
Deadly diseases, including cholera and typhoid,  
were spread because waste wasn’t flushed away.  
In 1775, Scottish inventor alexander cummings 
came to the rescue with his toilet. His invention was an 
improvement on previous models because the pipe that 
took away the waste included an s trap, a double bend 
that stopped horrible fumes from finding their way 
back up the pipe. The toilet was a relief to everyone 
and his design became the prototype for future toilets.
Like Cummings’s toilet, 
modern versions still use  
a bend to trap water, 
usually in a U shape.  
There have been some 
improvements, but the basic flush toilet  
design has stayed the same, whooshing 
water down a pipe to carry waste away.
Toilets cleaned up their  
act with the arrival of 
disinfectants. Carbolic  
acid was in use from the 
1860s to kill germs and 
improve cleanliness.
portable toilets, which use 
chemicals to deodorize 
waste, were invented in the 
1940s for shipyard workers. 
They are still used at  
concerts and festivals.

Early clocks
People have always tried to  
keep track of the time. More  
than 9,000 years ago, people used 
SundialS. In ancient Egypt and 
Babylon (modern-day Iraq), the 
constant drip of water was used 
to measure time. Mechanical clocks 
were invented in the 1300s, driven 
by falling weights, but they did 
not measure time accurately.
Scottish clockmaker 
Alexander Bain 
invented the first 
electric clock in 1840.
Precise pendulums
Italian inventor Galileo 
Galilei realized that the regular 
swing of a pendulum was a good 
way to measure time, but it was 
Dutch mathematician CHRiSTiaan 
HuYGenS who made clocks start 
ticking with precision. His pendulum clock 
of 1656 counted the seconds much more 
accurately than previous weight-
driven clocks. It was so reliable that 
Huygens fitted his clock with 
a second hand as well as 
minute and hour hands.
Starting in the 1500s, 
pocket watches were 
carried by the wealthy, 
though they weren’t 
very accurate at first.
By the way...
In addition to inventing the 
most accurate clock in the 
world, I built a telescope and 
discovered the rings of  
the planet Saturn.

Did you know?
Captain James Cook  
relied on Harrison’s marine  
chronometer during his 1772 
voyage from the Tropics  
to Antarctica.
Huygens’s clock was  
the template for all 
pendulum clocks that 
followed. It used a 
falling weight to make 
the pendulum swing.
The time a pendulum 
takes to swing back  
and forth is always the 
same, as long as the 
length of the pendulum 
doesn’t change and it keeps swinging. In 
a pendulum clock, the regular swing of 
the pendulum is captured by the 
escapement. The escapement is a 
device that uses the energy of the regular 
swing of the pendulum to allow the falling 
weight to move the hands on the clock 
face. At the same time, the escapement 
transfers energy from a falling weight to 
the pendulum to keep it swinging.

Marine chronometer
Pendulum clocks kept time on land, but at sea  
they were useless because of the repeated rocking  
of ships on the waves. Since navigation depended 
on telling time accurately, which could mean the 
difference between a successful voyage and a shipping 
disaster, governments offered a fortune in prize 
money to anyone who invented an accurate clock 
without a pendulum. In 1762, English carpenter 
John harrison won the British government’s 
prize with his Number Four marine chronometer.
Atomic clocks are the most 
precise timekeepers in the 
world. The first accurate 
one was made in 1955 by 
English physicist Louis Essen.
Marine chronometers 
used a balance wheel 
and a spring instead 
of a pendulum.

time accurately not only 
meant that everyone could

for experiments  
and research.
For each swing  
of the pendulum, 
one tooth of the 
escapement wheel 
is released. 
QuArtz crystAls, which 
vibrate at a constant rate in

Joseph Swan’s  
house in Gateshead, 
England, was the  
first to be lit  
by a light bulb.
The first car 
headlights used oil, 
but much safer 
electric ones were 
invented in 1898.
Neon lights, which 
contain the gas 
neon, were invented 
by Frenchman 
georges claude 
in 1910.
Switching on
The first electric light was switched on  
by Humphry Davy when he connected 
two charcoal rods to a battery in 1809. Davy’s  
light was bright, but it didn’t last long. It 
showed that some materials glow when 
electricity passes through them, but the  
lights often caught fire. Fellow Englishman 
Joseph Swan experimented with removing  
the AiR from the bulb in the 1870s  
to stop this, but ran into other problems. 
Davy’s lamp was designed 
to help miners, as an 
alternative to fire, which 
could cause accidents. 
Longer-lasting 
tungsten filaments 
were invented 
in 1910.
Did you know?
The first buildings with  
electric light had warning 
notices in them advising  
people not to light the  
bulbs with a match.
It paved the way for...

By the way...
I carried out  
4,700 experiments with 
different materials to find  
the perfect filament,  
including hair from  
a beard.
Edison’s light-bulb moment
Meanwhile, in the United States, 
Thomas Edison was experimenting 
with light bulbs too. He realized 
that the filament—the part 
that gets hot and glows—was 
the key to long-lasting light. 
By 1880, his charred bamboo 
filaments were burning for 
more than 1,200 hours. After 
falling out over who invented 
what, edison and Swan 
joined forces. Soon, 
they were bringing 
light to everybody. 
Flashbulbs  
were invented in 
1929, replacing 
dangerous and  
noisy Flash powder.
A light bulb’s 
filament is 
made out of 
material that  
does not 
conduct electricity very well. This 
resistance to the current makes 
the filament heat up and radiate 
light. The bulb is filled with 
nonreactive gases so that the  
hot filament does not catch fire. 
Plugging in
power plantS were set up 
so electricity could reach 
everybody with Edison’s bulbs. 
The world’s first electric 
company started out with  
52 customers in 1882. Before 
long, people were finding their 
way home in the dark by the 
glow of electric streetlights, 
and flipping switches for  
lights in their homes. This 
advertisement for Edison’s 
bulbs dates from 1909.
Light bulbs meant safe, bright  
lighting at the flip of a switch.  
Only now, after more than a hundred 
years, is the basic design being  
improved to make it more efficient.
Filament 
glows white-
hot when 
current 
passes 
through it. 
Electricity 
flows through 
the wire and 
into the 
filament.
Airtight 
glass casing
The first practical 
light-emitting diode 
(LED) was developed 
in 1962. They can be 
used as a replacement 
for light bulbs.

Not so long ago, cleaning and cooking 
were time-consuming, boring jobs. 
These clever devices lend a hand 
around the home so we can spend  
our time in more interesting ways.
Vacuum cleaner
Starting in 1901, British engineer Hubert Cecil 
Booth offered vacuum cleaning to rich 
Londoners with his huge Horse-drawN, 
gasoline-driven machine, from which a long 
hose would snake into the house through a 
window. James Spangler, a janitor in a US 
department store, invented a much smaller 
electric vacuum cleaner in 1907. He started a 
business that later became the Hoover Company.
Home helpers
Can opener
After canned food was invented in 1812, 
there was a long wait to open it safely. Canned army 
rations had instructions to use a Hammer aNd CHisel. 
People bashed and gouged away until 1870, when 
American inventor William Lyman patented a can 
opener with a cutting wheel. In the 1920s, safer rotary 
can openers were invented, based on Lyman’s design. 
Washing machine
Imagine having to wash and dry your clothes By HaNd. 
The first domestic washing machines removed some of 
the strain but were hand-powered, while enormous, 
clanking, steam-powered washing machines operated in 
businesses. Finally, electric washing machines were 
invented in the early 20th century—one of the first was 
invented by American Alva Fisher in 1908. This Canadian 
version dates from around 1920.

Dishwasher
By the 1800s, American women  
were fed up with doing the dishes. 
More than 30 of them came up with 
machines to take on the dull task, but 
the first successful one was invented  
in 1886 by socialite Josephine 
Cochran, who wanted to find a way to 
stop her china from being chipped by 
heavy-handed servants. Her machines 
were hand-powered for use at home, 
but bigger steam-powered ones were 
installed in hotels and restaurants. 
Microwave oven
These handy food heaters were invented 
during World War II, after American radar 
scientist percy LeBaron Spencer noticed 
that the microwave-producing radar set he 
was using had melted his chocolate bar.  
He realized the machine’s potential for 
Cooking food, and the first commercial 
microwave ovens went on sale in 1947.

Refrigerator
From hauling chunks of ice down 
mountains to opening a refrigerator door, 
chilling out has become a lot easier.
In early refrigerators, 
the compressor unit was 
located on top. Now, it 
is hidden inside.
Several shelves 
stored food, and 
there was a small 
compartment for ice.
The big freeze
Before refrigerators, people kept food  
from spoiling by storing it in cool, 
dark places or in a hole packed 
with ice or snow brought from  
the nearest mountain or frozen lake. 
Later on, rich families had specially 
built icehouses, with ice often 
imported in blocks from overseas. 
The trade in ice continued into the 
1950s—this iceman is supplying  
ice to businesses from his truck.
First fridges
In 1748, Scottish physician William 
Cullen discovered that evaporating ether 
could create freezing temperatures 
because evaporating liquids absorb heat. 
The first chilling machine, invented by 
American engineer Jacob Perkins 
in 1834, used this principle. Soon, 
industrial reFrigerators were 
cooling beer and meat. Domestic models 
became available in the 20th century.

In 1841, American doctor  
John Gorrie invented  
a refrigerator to cool

General Electric first

Fatal fridges
Until 1929, refrigerators were 
deadly—they used poisonous gases 
as coolants and were responsible for  
several deaths. As a result, a safer 
chlorofluorocarbon (cfc) 
called freon was used to cool 
refrigerators. It was not harmful to 
human health, but later scientists 
realized that CFCs were destroying 
the Earth’s ozone layer. Modern 
fridges use a less harmful coolant 
to reduce the environmental impact. 
They can also be recycled safely.
Did you know?
German physicist Albert 
Einstein invented a 
refrigerator in partnership 
with his former student Leo 
Szilard and patented  
it in 1930.
A refrigerator works by 
changing a substance 
called a coolant from  
a liquid to a gas and 
back again. The liquid 
passes through an expansion valve, which 
turns it into a cold gas. The gas absorbs 
heat from the refrigerator’s contents, 
keeping them cool. The gas is compressed 
into a liquid as it leaves the refrigerator, 
which heats it up. The liquid loses heat to 
the room before passing through the 
expansion valve again.

ERIAL that shaped the world
Fantastic plastic
People have used natural materials, such as rubber 
and tortoiseshell, for thousands of years, shaping them 
into hard-wearing objects. In 1905, Belgian-born chemist 
Leo BaekeLand mixed phenol (a disinfectant) with 
formaldehyde (a preservative) and came up with 
Bakelite, the first completely human-made plastic. 
This versatile material can be molded into shape, but 
sets hard and doesn’t melt easily. It was used to make 
music records, furniture, jewelry, and this radio cover.
Bakelite was heatproof  
and did not conduct electricity.
Leo Baekeland 
received the US 
patent for his 
invention in 1909.

73
Plenty of plastic
Bakelite proved so handy that chemists 
rushed to make new and even more useful 
plastics. In the 1930s, American chemist 
Wallace carothers produced the 
first completely human-made fiber, 
nylon. In the same decade, newly 
invented Perspex was taking the place 
of glass and polythene began to be 
used in packaging. Soon, plastics were 
finding more and more uses.
English inventor 
AlexAnder PArkes made a 
semisynthetic plastic called 
PArkesine in 1856, used to 
make a variety of 
domestic objects.

Going green 
Today, plastic is everywhere—from 
the packaging of your food to the 
rubber duck in your bathtub. 
Most plastics are produced from 
oil, a limited resource, and can 
takes centuries to decompose 
once discarded. bioplastics  
made from organic material  
are now being developed as  
a green alternative  
to oil-based plastics. 
Plastics are polymers—
materials made of 
molecules that consist  
of thousands or millions  
of atoms. Polymers are 
made by joining together small molecules 
(monomers) in a repeating structure that 
forms very long chains. Many different 
molecules can be used, and they can be 
combined in a variety of different ways—this 
is why there are so many types of plastic.

Plastic is lightweight,  
cheap, tough, difficult to break, 
and doesn’t rot. No wonder it’s 
absolutely everywhere: in 
packaging, toys, furniture, 
computers, and clothing.  
But because it doesn’t rot, 
garbage bins are full of plastic 
that will take hundreds of  
years to break down.

Battery
Today, batteries are 
useful if you can’t plug  
a device into an outlet, 
but when they were first  
invented, they were the only 
things capable of generating  
an electric current.
Electrical storm
Electricity is as old as lightning. In 1752, 
American scientist benjamin franklin flew 
a kite with a metal key in a storm and realized 
that the sparks coming from the metal proved 
that lightning is a form of electricity. This static 
(“at rest”) electricity was first discovered in 
ancient Greece by a mathematician named 
Thales who produced a static electric charge 
by polishing amber with animal fur. 
Frog findings
Even though people knew about 
electricity, they did not yet know how  
to produce an electric current—a flow  
of electric charge. In 1780, Italian doctor 
luigi galvani noticed that the muscles 
in the legs of dead frogs twitched when 
they made contact with two different 
metals. He thought this was caused by 
“animal electricity” in the frog itself.  
But fellow scientist alessandro volTa 
realized that the electricity wasn’t due to 
the dead frog, but to the different metals. 
Understanding electric current 
led to the electricity supply we have 
come to rely on today. The first 
public electricity lit the streets of 
Godalming, England, in 1881.
Did you know?
French emperor Napoleon I  
was so impressed with 
Alessandro Volta’s invention  
of the voltaic pile that  
he made him a count.
In Galvani’s experiment,  
the frog was the equivalent 
of the brine-soaked  
paper in Volta’s pile.

The electric flashlight first 
came into use in 1899.  
Like today’s flashlights, it 
used a dry-cell battery.
Charging ahead
The voltaic pile was groundbreaking, 
but it leaked and didn’t last long. The 
first rechargeable battery was 
the lead-acid battery invented in 
1859 by French physicist Gaston 
Planté. The basic principle of 
this version remained unchanged 
into the 21st century. The first dry 
battery (using paste instead of liquid) 
was the zinc-carbon one created by 
German scientist carl gassner in 
1886, which led to the convenient 
batteries we put into flashlights today. 
Tablet computers, 
cell phones, and other 
mobile devices in everyday 
use all depend on a battery 
as a power source.
Voltaic pile
Volta had discovered that two different metals 
submerged in acid could generate a tiny 
electric current between them. In 1800, he 
created his voltaic pile—the world’s first 
battery. It was made from layers of copper, 
cardboard soaked in saltwater, and zinc— 
each group of three makes a “cell,” and the 
more cells, the greater the electric 
current produced. The current is 
generated by a chemical 
reaction that moves 
electrons from one  
metal to the other.

The battery was the first  
means of generating an  
electric current and the first  
easily portable energy source. 
Without it, there would be no 
phones, radio, or battery-
operated devices.

Volta also discovered 
methane gas while poking 
around in a marsh, and 
invented an exploding pistol 
that he used to figure out 
the oxygen content of air.

Keeping it  
       together
Everything would fall apart  
without the help of these small  
but useful inventions.
A zipper’s teeth  
are brought together  
and locked into  
place by the slider.
Safety pin
Brooches were used to fasten clothes more than a 
thousand years before the invention of the safety 
pin in 1849. American inventor Walter Hunt’s 
design improved on the brooch: It was made from 
a single piece of wire for easy manufacture, it used 
a coil in the wire rather than a hinge, and the clasp 
fastened the pin and shielded the user’s fingers at 
the same time. It was simplE, yEt Brilliant.
Hook and eye
People have been hooking up their clothes 
for hundreds of years. In the 1300s, hook-and-
eye fasteners were known as “crochet and 
loop” (crochet is French for “hook”), and  
the simple yet effective design hasn’t 
changed much since. Hook-and-eye  
fasteners lent their support to the world’s  
first brassieres, or bras, which were invented 
in the 1400s. Most of today’s bras still use them.

Snaps
If you were an actor with a quick change

easy. German Heribert Bauer’s 1885 snaps 
were improved by American Jack Weil 
during the 1900s, who added them to denim 
shirts in place of buttons—giving the 
finishing touch to the cowboy look.
Zipper
American Whitcomb Judson wanted to get his 
boots on and off quicker, so in 1893 he 
invented a fastener that hooked them up with 
one pull, using a sliding device on a row of 
clasps. Judson’s fastener tended to come 
undone, but Gideon Sundback developed  
a version that used metal teeth on flexible 
tape. It was used as the fastener for a boot 
called the Zipper, and the name stuck.
Velcro
George de Mestral got the idea for Velcro when 
he saw burdock burrs sticking to his dog’s coat.
When he looked at them through a microscope, 
he saw that the burrs were covered in tiny 
hooks that attached to loops in the dog’s fur. 
He developed Velcro so that one side was 
covered in tiny hooks, and the other in tiny 
loops. The name comes from the French 
velours croché, or “hooked velvet.”

Money
Although it’s only made of cheap metals  
or paper, money makes it easier to  
BUY the things you need.
Taking notes
Paper money took shape in  
China by the 1100s, as a way  
of avoiding the weighty coinage 
necessary to complete large 
transactions. Although news  
of printed money filtered 
into Europe, it was another 
500 years before 
Sweden issued  
the continent’s first 
banknotes in 1661.
Loose change
Before money, people would  
swap or barter for the things 
they needed. Over time, useful  
or beautiful things, such as shells, 
feathers, and even dried tea, were 
used instead of bartering. Around 
650 bce, the kingdom of Lydia 
(modern-day western Turkey) 
began to stamp gold and silver 
metal disks called staters (above). 
They were the first coins. 
Cash to credit
These days, most people spend 
their money without using coins or 
banknotes at all. debit cardS enable you to 
access the money in your bank account at any time. 
Banks also issue credit cards, allowing consumers to 
buy items immediately and pay back the debts over time.
Money has transformed  
the world into a  
global economy made up  
of different currencies, 
giving almost everything  
a price.

Sand solution
When American student Joseph Woodland was researching a 
technology that could identify food products in 1948, he found  
the solution on a beach. As he drew lines in the sand with his 
fingers, he imagined a code of bars and spaces. This resulted  
in the Universal Product Code (UPC), or bar code system, which 
was first adopted in 1974 and continues to be used today.
Code conversion
Bar codes are basically identity tags. At 
first glance, they are a series of vertical 
bars of different widths on a product’s 
packaging. When read by a laser 
scanner, the item is quickly identified, 
along with information about it, such as 
price and stock information. About five 
billion bar codes are scanned every day.
Bar code
It revolutionized retail and is the  
best system for RECOGNIZING  
objects, bar none.
A laser scans  
the bars for a 
computer to read. 
Black and white bars of 
different widths represent 
numbers from 1 to 9.
The six-digit 
manufacturing  
code identifies  
the maker of  
the product.
Guard bars are  
longer and separate 
the two codes.
Product code  
(last six digits)  
is unique to the 
item being sold.
Bar codes speed up 
transactions and cut wait 
times, but they also allow 
suppliers to track what 
people are buying.

Plow
The plow is a farming tool used to 
prepare the earth for the seed-sowing 
season. Plowing has saved farmers 
time and toil in the fields, and 
transformed food production.
Did you know?
Camels and llamas have 
been used to pull plows  
in regions where there 
were too few horses  
and oxen.
In 1700, Englishman Jethro  
tull invented the seed drill.  
This device dropped seeds  
down a chute into a  
furrow in organized  
rows called drills.
A horse-drawn reaper 
was patented in 1834. 
Cyrus MCCorMiCk’s 
mechanism made 
cutting and gathering 
crops less strenuous.
Ancient ards
Plowing has been an integral part  
of the farming calendar since ancient 
times. Turning the earth in the fall prepares 
the ground for seed sowing in the spring. 
Around 5000 bce, early civilizations broke 
the ground with an antler or branch to 
cultivate crops. This developed into a 
pointed wooden plow called an ard.  
The ancient Egyptians attached the ard  
to a beam harnessed to two oxen and  
got to work plowing the Nile valley.
Cast-iron progress
During the 1800s, the 
design of the plow improved 
when the wooden point was 
flattened into a blade of iron. 
Called a share, this blade sliced into 
the ground, loosening and turning the 
soil. The result was a neat strip of soil, 
or furrow, running through the land. 
The plow set the stage for the agricultural 
revolution, reducing the effort required to 
produce large quantities of crops. Metal 
blades are still used to cut furrows today.
By the way...
Medieval plows  
were so heavy that  
it was not uncommon 
for eight oxen to pull  
a single machine.
Share blade cuts 
and loosens soil.
The handle is  
held and steered

Turning the soil makes  
it more fertile, and  
buries weeds so they 
can break down.
Steam-powered plows
By the 1860s, the invention of the steam engine made 
animals the second choice for pulling plows. English 
engineer John Fowler devised the double-engine 
system, in which steam engines on both sides of a field 
pulled “anti-balance” plows on a steel rope. These tipped 
at each end so the land could be plowed back and forth, 
producing six Furrows at a time. Fowler’s plows 
were exported to Europe and Africa, but the expense 
meant that only large farms used them.
Today, tractors pull 
large metal plows. 
Although this heavy-duty 
machinery does the hard 
work, the basic principle 
remains the same.
The benefits of plowing 
led to crop rotation, 
ensuring fertile soil and 
bountiful harvests. Rapid 
food production led to 
industrial-scale farming.

Crane
Heavy loads are given a LIFT by  
an invention that’s happy to do  
all the hard work
Early cranes
Invented in ancient Greece around 515 bce,  
the crane was adopted and developed further  
by the Romans. Early Roman cranes used 
treadmills powered by slaves. These machines 
made it easier to handle and lift building 
materials and other heavy items.
Modern cranes
Today’s cranes are crafted 
from steel and powered 
by engines or electric 
motors. Tower cranes are used by 
construction workers to lift the heavy 
loads involved in erecting tall buildings. 
Other cranes move containers on board 
ships or carry objects around factories.
Rope loops over  
the top pulley,  
so the rope is pulled 
down but the load  
is lifted vertically.
Slaves walking 
inside the 
treadmill turn 
the wheel, which 
pulls on the 
rope to lift  
the load.
A compound pulley 
shares the weight  
of the load between 
two pulleys, so  
less lifting force  
is required.
Two pulleys 
connected by  
a rope are 
known as a 
compound 
pulley.

Explosive mix
Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero discovered liquid 
nitroglycerin in 1847, but this explosive was  
so dangerous that even a knock could set it off.  
The hazardous nature of nitroglycerin made it 
impossible to use. Explosives needed to become  
more stable if they were ever to be beneficial.
Promise of peace
Nobel believed dynamite would 
aid the construction of roads, 
tunnels, and mines. However, to 
his disappointment, dynamite also 
became a weapon of war, so 
Nobel left his fortune to establish 
the nobel Prize. Since 1901, this 
annual set of awards recognizes the 
work that most helps humankind.
Off with a bang!
After studying chemical 
engineering, Swedish 
scientist Alfred Nobel 
was determined to make more 
stable explosives. He found 
that mixing nitroglycerin 
with kieselguhr 
(a chalky sand) resulted in a safe 
explosive that could be dropped without 
exploding and yet detonated on demand 
with a blasting cap. He called his 
invention “dynamite.”

3. BANG! The shock

Did you know?
The ancient Romans used 
volcano ash to make their 
concrete. Today, about  
1.3 billion tons of cement  
is produced every year. 
Strong steel girders  
are used in construction 
to form the supporting 
structures of buildings.
Steel
Steel is an alloy (mixture) of iron and other 
substances. It has been used for thousands 
of years, but it really took off in 1858 when 
Englishman Henry Bessemer invented a 
process to produce large amounts of it 
very cheaply. In 1913, English laboratory 
researcher Harry Brearley was in pursuit 
of a long-lasting steel for gun barrels, 
when he discovered a type that resisted 
damage from acids. Today, his stainless 
steel is everywhere, from items such as 
saucepans and sinks to tiny nuts and bolts 
holding household goods together.
Portland cement
Early civilizations relied on natural 
minerals to bond building materials 
together. By the 19th century, factories 
made basic cement from local limestone 
and clay. In 1824, British bricklayer 
JosepH aspdin ground cooked 
limestone and clay into powder and 
added water. He named the strong 
concrete “Portland cement” after quality 
Portland stone. affordaBle and 
Hard-wearing, cement is used to lay 
bricks, plaster walls, and construct roads.

Did you know?
The windows of protected 
vehicles, such as tanks and 
military aircraft, have such 
thick layers of glass that  
they could stop a bullet.
Kevlar
This synthetic fiber is a relatively young 
invention in the material world. Created by 
American chemist Stephanie KwoleK  
and patented in 1966, Kevlar is five times 
stronger than steel. In addition to its super 
strength, it is lightweight and does not rust. 
This makes the tightly woven fibers ideal for 
the bulletproof veStS worn by police 
officers. When it’s not saving lives, Kevlar  
is used to make parachutes, skis, cell 
phones, construction clothing, bicycle 
tires, and underwater cables.
Glass
Heating the mineral sodium 
carbonate and sand produces glass, 
but it is unclear who discovered the 
process. The Egyptians were glazing 
jewelry beads in 2500 bce, while the 
ancient Romans were the first to use 
transparent glass. Around 1000 ce, the 
glass industry took off in Europe, with 
the venetianS of italy producing 
the finest glass for centuries afterward. By 
the 17th century, most Europeans had 
glass windowpanes at home. Eyeglasses, 
mirrors, and light bulbs are among the 
many inventions that make use of glass.
Titanium
In 1791, English clergyman william Gregor 
discovered titanium in its mineral form, but it 
wasn’t until 1932 that Luxembourg metal expert 
William Kroll produced the metallic 
titanium used today. Removing impurities 
results in a material as strong as steel but half 
as heavy. Named after the Titans of Greek 
mythology, titanium is used in aircraft, spacecraft, 
boats, bicycles, and machine parts like these cogs.

Hard at work
Unimate led the way for robotic employees, 
with more than one million robots at work 
in factories today. In the car industry, robots 
are now in the driver’s seat, making up 
1 in every 10 car-production workers. 
Their robotic arms have been developed so 
that a variety of tools can be attached, such 
as hooks, grippers, or welding equipment.
Surgical robotS with 
arms and viewers called 
endoscopes allow 
surgeons to perform 
operations with far 
greater preciSion than 
they could by hand.
Help in the home  
could soon come from  
robot houSekeeperS. PaPePo 
robots aSSiSt with choreS, 
control household devices, 
and monitor e-mails.
Unimate
The first real robot, called 
Unimate, was a computerized  
robotic arm with a gripper attached. 
In 1961, American car manufacturer 
General Motors became the  
first company to use a Unimate robot  
in its production process. Unimate 
welded parts, poured liquid metal,  
and stacked metal sheets.

Ideal applicants
For an employer, a robot is the perfect employee. It 
works fast and performs repetitive tasks but 
never tires or makes mistakes. Dangerous tasks 
such as clearing land mines or putting out fires 
are no problem for a robot without feeling. 
Put in a dark, hot, or unpleasant 
place, robots work without 
complaint or payment.
For those who want a 
pretrained animal 
friend, robot pets could 
be the answer. Robot 
dogs and cats move like 
real animals, but they 
also sing and dance!
Busy hospitals and nursing 
homes may soon use robot 
nurses to assist with care. 
Lifting and carrying patients 
is one task that robots  
carry out with ease.
Artificial intelligence
Robots do not have the  
natural intelligence of people. Jobs 
requiring decision-making are better 
suited to humans. Developing artificial 
intelligence is the focus for robotic 
engineers today. Some robots already 
recognize faces, play instruments, and 
detect smells. This robot, called 
kismet, was developed by American 
researcher Cynthia Breazeal in the 
1990s to show how humans and 
robots can interact.
To date, robots have been used 
mainly as cheap labor, doing the 
dirty work that people want to 
avoid. This has cut costs and 
increased production. But with 
advances in artificial intelligence, 
who knows what this incredible 
invention will be capable  
of in the future?

Lead pencil
Although the Babylonians and Egyptians  
were inscribing stones and tablets thousands  
of years ago, it was not until the late  
18th century that lead pencils first made  
their mark. The forerunner to the lead pencil 
that we use today was invented in France 
and Austria during the 1790s. Erasers 
were added to the end of pencils in the 
1850s. Today, more than 14 Billion 
pencils are manufactured annually.
Ballpoint pen
Early ink pens proved problematic 
because often the ink inside either 
dried up or leaked. In the 1880s, 
American John J. Loud developed 
an early version of the ballpoint 
pen, which was later improved by 
Hungarian journalist láSzló Bíró in 
the 1940s. A tiny, rotating metal ball added 
to a tube of ink controlled the flow and 
prevented drying. More than 100 billion 
ballpoint pens have been sold since.

Post-it note
Created by American company 3M,  
the Post-it note allows you to 
attach notes to most surfaces without 
leaving a mark. The same note can be 
used repeatedly since only some of 
the glue bubbles on the adhesive strip 
pop each time. The Post-it went on 
sale in the United States in 1980  
before going global.
Pocket calculator
The early equivalent of the calculator 
was a counting device called an abacus. 
Mechanical calculators developed over 
time, but something didn’t add up: 
They were slow, bulky machines, 
operated by hand cranks. American 
company Texas Instruments developed 
the first handheld calculator in 1967. 
By the 1970s, calculators were pocket-
sized—great gadgets for 
number-crunching students 
and office workers.
Sticky tape
Another employee of 3M, Richard Drew, 
developed sticky tape in 1930 after 
researching adhesives and the material 
cellophane. The transparent tape coincided 
with a huge economic downturn  
in the United States. Consumers welcomed 
a product that fixed their household  
goods when new ones  
were unaffordable.

Back to basics
In the late 1800s, miners, farmers, and 
factory workers in the United States 
found that their demanding jobs 
required resilient clothing. 
American tailor Jacob Davis 
strengthened cotton trousers 
with metal rivets, while 
German business partner 
Levi StrauSS publicized 
the new “jeans.” On May 20, 
1873, the duo received the 
patent and this date is 
considered the birthday of jeans.
Style secrets
The tough new workwear was made 
from a fabric called denim, said to have 
originated in the port of Nîmes, France. 
A woven mix of blue and white cotton 
threads, it is the distinctive weave of the 
material that makes it so strong. The dark 
indigo dye was perfect for clothes 
that were not washed very often. 
Forever in blue jeans
The first jeans were so loose that they needed  
suspenders to hold them up. By the mid-20th century, 
dressing down in denim proved a hit with the 
younger generation thanks to the cowboys of 
Western movies and pop stars such as eLviS 
PreSLey who wore tighter, trendier versions. Today, 
jeans come in many different cuts and colors.

Staying ahead of the game
In the 1930s, shoe companies began tailoring their products  
to sports. Studs were screwed into soccer shoes for better 
support, clips were added to cycling shoes to prevent 
slippage, and spikes on sprinting shoes improved grip. 
Today’s high-tech sneakers include automatically 
adjusting cushioning systems that adapt to the individual 
wearer and specific surface to ensure peak performance.
Selling soles
Sports shoes were up and 
running by the mid-19th 
century, after American 
Charles Goodyear invented 
vulcanized rubber.  
Billed as a flexible 
alternative to leather, 
the rubber-soled 
sports shoe was 
adopted by the US Rubber Company in 
1892, which established the Keds business 
in 1917 to make and market the shoes.
Groundbreaking design
Soon, many companies were producing 
shoes that combined comfort and style. 
Lightweight canvas uppers allowed  
air to circulate, while laces were 
loosened or tightened as required. 
The shoes were nicknamed 
“sneakers” because their 
vulcanized rubber soles let 
the wearer sneak around 
without being heard.
Thick rubber  
soles cushion  
the foot.
Laces are fed through

This ornate, painted 
harpsichord was made  
in Antwerp in 1643.
Violin
The smallest, highest-pitched member 
of the string family is the violin. 
Developed in the 16th century, the 
invention is usually attributed to Italian 
AndreA AmAti, who made an early 
version to entertain King Charles IX of 
France. The instrument was enhanced over the 
following two centuries into the wooden wonder we 
know today. This example was made by famous Italian 
violin-maker Antonio Stradivari in 1709. 
Keyboard
For centuries, keyboards were used to 
play organ pipes. But in the 15th century, 
they began to be used to play strings, and 
the hArpsichord was born. Pressing a key 
plucked a string, with each string playing a 
note. The piano arrived in the 18th century, 
with its sophisticated keyboard of white 
And blAck keys. Pianos use hammers 
to strike the strings, so the notes can be 
played loudly or quietly depending 
on how hard the key is pressed.

musical instruments have existed since 
prehistoric times. As materials and 
designs have evolved, primitive versions 
have been fine-tuned, while new models 
strike a chord with musicians and 
audiences alike.

95
Flute
Woodwind instruments consist of a hollow tube attached to 
a mouthpiece. When blown, air inside vibrates to produce 
sound. The flute is a popular example. Early flutes were 
simple and wooden, but developed into metal models with 
complex keys. German inventor Theobald Boehm hit 
the right note in the 19th century with his system of 
pads over holes, operated by keys or fingers.
Drum
While many percussion instruments 
require precise force to make the 
perfect sound, the drum marches to its 
own beat. Drums have been discovered in 
ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) 
that date back 5,000 years. From tribal 
rituals and military conflicts to medieval 
dances and rock concerts, this instrument 
has always drummed up enthusiasm. This 
drum was used by a confederate soldier 
during the Civil War (1861–1865).
Trumpet
This instrument has blown 
audiences away since ancient 
times. People in China signaled 
with trumpets as long ago as 1500 bce, 
while Egyptian King Tutankhamun’s 
tomb contained trumpets similar to the 
ones shown on the right. Now made from 
brass, the trumpet is famous for its strong 
sound. In the 1820s, German instrument-makers 
Stölzel and Blühmel created trumpets with 
valves to produce more notes.

Video games
The development of electronic games  
to play at home has brought FUN AND 
GAMES to players all over the world.
Past play
Coin-operated arcade games 
in public places were popular in 
the 1970s. Then, in 1975, Atari 
launched a home version of the 
bat-and-ball arcade game Pong, 
and the video game revolution 
was born. Companies released 
new console formats and games 
to the growing market. By 1980, 
Pac-man made the leap to 
homes, becoming one of the 
most PoPular games ever.
Game on 
The 1990s saw computer giants 
including Nintendo, sega, and 
sony competing for dominance 
in the video-game console 
market. Their portable, handheld 
devices and improved graphics 
allowed youNg eNthusiasts 
to play while on the move, 
with action and sports games 
dominating the field. Nintendo’s 
Game Boy was first choice for a 
generation of players, selling 
more than 118 million units.
Ahead of the game
Instead of using joysticks  
and keypads, today’s  
games are played on home 
computers, advanced consoles, 
cell phones, or tablets. Online 
role-playing games give players 
the chance to inhabit 
incredible three-dimensional 
lands where they create their 
own characters, called 
avatars, and iNteract 
with other players.
Realistic special effects 
and surround sound are 
features of today’s 
video games.

Lightweight 
headphones with no

provided a private 
listening experience.
Music on the move
The personal stereo was the brainchild of 
Masaru Ibuka, chairman of the Japanese 
electronics company Sony, who wanted to 
combine a compact tape recorder with 
lightweight headphones. The 
Walkman was launched in 1979. This 
handy, portable device let users 
listen to their favorite cassettes 
while they were out and about. 
By 1982, more than 100 
million had been sold.
Compact choice
As compact discs began to 
replace cassettes in the music 
market, sony introduced the 
industry’s first portable player  
for compact discs in 1982. The 
DIscMan was a success among 
music lovers, but the device 
could carry only one disc at a 
time and had a tendency to skip.
A small screen 
showed which 
track on the CD 
was playing.
Tiny tunes
German inventors DIeter seItzer 
and karlheInz branDenburg 
came up with a way of compressing 
digital music so that a music file takes 
up much less space. Their format is 
called MP3 and manufacturers used it  
to make small digital music players. The 
first MP3 player became available in 
1998. These groundbreaking gadgets 
can store thousands of songs.

Movies
Making pictures MOVE  
on the big screen
The history of the big screen features 
an all-star cast of inventors, stories  
of success, and a happy ending.
Picture pioneers
English doctor P.M. Roget found that  
seeing an object in similar positions over  
a rapid sequence, like this one of a horse 
running, resulted in the object appearing 
to move. In 1824, he called this “persistence 
of vision.” Inventors wanted to create a 
better way to produce the illusion of  
moving images from still ones. 
French premiere
The first to figure it out were 
the French brothers Auguste 
and louis lumière. They held 
the first public showing of 
projected moving images in a 
Parisian café basement in 1895. 
Their combined portable 
camera and projector, the 
cinematograph, recorded 
“moving pictures” on a  
strip of celluloid film. The 
premiere was a hit with  
the paying audience and  
hailed the start of the 
moTion picTure era.
By the way...
By inventing the  
cinematograph, we became 
masters of the short film,  
with more than 1,000 clips  
to our names.

caused a sensation. One depicted people 
leaving a factory, while another showed a train 
arriving at a station (above). Although today’s 
blockbusters use new technology and special 
effects, movies remain just a series of separate 
images played in quick succession.
Motion pictures led to the creation of the 
movie industry, which has enthralled 
audiences for decades and made stars of 
the actors appearing in its films. People 
around the world spend about  
$30 billion on movie tickets every year.

Based on explosive  
gunpowder, show-stealing  
fireworks have a  
colorful past.
Chinese launch
Gunpowder was discovered 
accidentally when ancient Chinese 
alchemists looked for a magic potion 
to create eternal life. It was produced 
by mixing three powders—saltpeter, 
sulfur, and charcoal. When burned, the 
combination released so much gas that 
explosions resulted. Bamboo poles 
filled with gunpowder formed the world’s 
first fireworks. They were used to  
mark festivals and religious occasions.

of fireworks, producing  
more than 90 percent

Gunpowder plot
In the Middle Ages, rockets became 
weapons, catapulted into enemy bases 
to explode on impact and set camps 
on fire. Famous English conspirator 
Guy Fawkes plotted a similarly 
dastardly deed with gunpowder. His 
failed attempt to blow up London’s 
Houses of Parliament on November 5, 
1605, is remembered every year with 
dummies of Fawkes burned at 
Firework displays.
Spectrum of color
The future is glowing bright for 
fireworks. Color chemistry has 
developed a rainbow effect—magnesium 
and aluminum make white light, sodium 
salts make yellow, copper salts make 
blue, strontium nitrate or carbonate 
makes red, and barium nitrate makes 
green. Scientists are researching different 
chemical combinations in order 
to make ever more impressive fireworks.

Ancient chocolatiers
Cacao beans were an integral part of ancient life in Mexico 
and Central America, making the Inca, Aztec, and Maya 
peoples the first true chocolatiers. They mixed cacao beans 
with spices to create a bitter drink called chocolatl, from 
which chocolate takes its name. Believing the beans had 
MAgIcAl propertIes, they used the drink in their 
sacred birth, marriage, and death rituals.
Swiss chocolatier Daniel 
Peter added condensed 
milk to the recipe in 
1875 and invented  
milk chocolate bars.
Fellow Swiss chocolatier 
roDolPhe linDt created

in 1879, which produced 
smooth chocolate without 
the gritty texture it  
had previously.

Food of the gods
Chocolate has its roots in the 
cacao tree, Theobroma cacao. 
This Latin name means “food 
of the gods,” and the tree has 
long flourished in the hot 
climate of Central and South 
America. Inside each colorful 
fruit pod are sweet juice and 
bItter cAcAo beAns— 
the essential ingredient  
of chocolate.
Chocolate
For centuries, chocolate was 
a bitter drink, but it became 
a famously favored food  
when the ingredients  
were sweetened and solid 
chocolate was invented. 
By the way...

Known as “the Great 
American Chocolate 
Bar,” the HersHey bar 
went on sale in 1900. 
It became one of the 
world’s best-selling 
chocolate bars.
The founding of the New 
york CoCoa exCHaNge in 
1925 recognized cocoa  
as an important Commodity 
that could be bought and 
sold on the open market.
Chocolate houses
In the 16th century, European 
conquistadors arrived in the 
Americas and discovered the cacao 
beans. Realizing the commercial 
opportunity, Spanish conqueror 
Hernando Cortéz sweetened the 
chocolatl drink with cane sugar to 
cater to European tastes. In the 
17th century, fashionable 
chocolate houses were popping 
up across Europe, allowing high 
society to savor the new taste. 
Only the wealthy could afford 
this sweet treat.
Chocolate is one of the world’s favorite  
flavors, and one of the most lucrative: The  
modern chocolate industry is expected to  
be worth a mouthwatering $98.3 billion  
by 2016. Although doctors recommend  
consuming chocolate in moderation, 
scientists are investigating the many 
chemicals in chocolate,  
searching for health benefits.
How it changed the world
Birth of the bar
In 1828, Dutch chemist Casparus Van Houten 
invented powdered chocolate or “Dutch cocoa.” 
Englishman Joseph Fry then added melted cocoa 
butter to Dutch cocoa in 1847, producing chocolate 
paste. solid chocolate was born! In 1868, 
English chocolate company Cadbury began making 
and marketing bars of chocolate. The tasty new 
treat quickly spread around the world.

The medical world was under the weather for centuries 
due to a basic lack of understanding. Now it is the 
picture of good health, thanks to our attention to 
cleanliness and safety in treatments. Improvements 
in equipment were just what the doctor ordered, 
making them a welcome addition to clinics and  
hospitals. Forward-thinking inventions have gone for 
a check-up, been given the all-clear, and are now put 
to the best use—saving patients’ lives.

Chloroform
Discovered in 1831, chloroform was  
first used as an anesthetic by Scottish 
physician James Young Simpson in 1847. 
He used it to provide pain relief for 
women, including Queen Victoria, during 
childbirth. However, chloroform had 
dangerous side effects. Some devices,  
such as this Dubois machine (left), tried  
to make it safer by mixing it with air.
Anesthetics
Putting patients to SLEEP was the first 
step toward modern surgical techniques
Modern techniques
Today, anesthetics can be local (numbing a 
body part such as a foot) or general (making a 
patient unconscious). Amylocaine, the first 
human-made local anesthetic, was developed by 
French chemist erneSt fourneau in 1903. 
Some general anesthetics are administered 
using an injection and work in less than 
30 seconds. Others are given as a carefully 
controlled dose to be inhaled.

Wide awake
Surgery in the past was brutal.  
Patients were left wide awake or 
groggy with alcohol as cuts were 
made in their bodies. The pain  
or shock often resulted in death. 
Then, in 1846, American dentist 
William Morton discovered that he 
could use the chemical ether to 
make a person unconscious  
before surgery.

Germ theory
People in the past didn’t understand 
how infections occurred. Doctors 
operated in dirty, germ-ridden 
conditions and thought bad air was 
to blame. In the mid-19th century, 
French scientist Louis Pasteur 
showed that some diseases and many 
infections were caused by bacteria and 
other microorganisms invading the body.
Keeping it clean
From the 1890s onward, 
surgical instruments were boiled 
to sterilize them, eliminating all 
microbes before use. Face masks 
were adopted, and surgeons now 
cLean their hands with 
antiseptic solutions before 
surgery. Rates of infection have 
been slashed from 50 percent  
to less than 1 percent.
Lister method
British surgeon JosePh 
Lister became convinced 
that microbes in the air were 
causing infections in wounds, 
which were usually left open. 
In the 1860s, Lister started  
to clean wounds and soak 
dressings in carbolic acid—
the first antiseptic—which 
killed many infection-
causing microbes. He also 
built a “donkey engine” 
(left) to spray carbolic 
acid mist throughout  
his operating theater.

after surgery plummeted.

Florey and Chain
Fleming had chanced upon the first 
antibiotic, but isolating penicillin in 
quantities large enough to treat people 
took more than a decade. A team in 
Oxford, England, led by Australian 
scientist Howard Florey used hospital 
bedpans and cow-milking equipment to 
produce enough penicillin to run 
medical trials on humans in 1941. 
They proved successful in fighting a 
range of infections and diseases.
Streptomycin was first made 
in 1943 by American 
scientist Selman WakSman 
from bacteria found in soil. 
It was the first antibiotic 
remedy for tuberculosis.
tetracycline was first 
discovered in 1945 and 
then made in labs by 
American drug company 
Pfizer in the early 1950s. It 
became the moSt preScribed

Fleming’s fluke
By the 19th century, scientists had 
figured out that many diseases are 
caused by microscopic living things 
called bacteria. In 1928, Scottish 
bacteriologist alexander Fleming 
noticed that one of his petri dishes 
containing Staphylococcus bacteria had 
become contaminated with a blue mold, 
which seemed to have wiped out the 
bacteria. Fleming realized that the mold 
contained a bacteria-killing chemical, 
which he called penicillin. 
Stopping DISEASES in their tracks
Antibiotics
these wonder drugs are one of 
medicine’s most important weapons  
in the fight against disease-causing 
bacteria. But the first antibiotic was 
discovered entirely by accident.
By the way...
I was a key member of 
Howard Florey’s team. Along 
with Florey and Alexander 
Fleming, I was awarded  
the 1945 Nobel Prize  
for Medicine. 
Ernst Chain proved 
penicillin’s success in fighting 
bacteria in mammals through 
experiments with mice. 

109
Amazing antivirals
Viruses are different from bacteria. 
They invade healthy cells and force 
them to copy the virus so that it 
spreads. Gertrude B. elion 
was an American chemist who 
developed the first widely available 
antiviral drug, acyclovir, in the 
1970s. It was used to treat the 
herpes virus, which causes cold 
sores. She later came out of 
retirement to help create AZT,  
the first anti-HIV drug.
ElizabEth lEE hazEn and 
RachEl FullER bRown 
patented the antibiotic 
nystatin in 1957. It  
is used to fight  
fungal infections. 
The discovery  
of penicillin saved  
millions of lives, but it also 
led to a revolution in the 
development of new drugs, 
with many more antibiotics 
following in its wake. Along 
with antivirals, these drugs 
have provided safe  
treatments for  
countless conditions. 
Mass production
Florey’s successful trials led 
American drug companies to  
start producing the drug in large 
quantities. The first stocks of  
penicillin were sent to help soldiers  
wounded in World War ii, and 
dramatically reduced the number of 
deaths from infected wounds. After the 
war, the new drug was in demand to 
combat diseases such as pneumonia, 
scarlet fever, gangrene, and diphtheria.

Father and son lens-makers, 
Hans and ZacHarias 
Janssen experimented with 
lenses in tubes in the 1590s to 
make the first microscopes. They 
were able to magnify their view 
of small things by around 10 
times. Less than a century later, 
fellow Dutchman Anton Van 
Leeuwenhoek built microscopes 
that could magnify by 270 times.

Electron microscopes
German physicist ernst ruska 
developed microscopes in the 1930s that 
beamed a stream of electrons rather 
than light through a specimen. These can 
achieve far greater magnification—up to 
an amazing 500,000 times. Incredibly 
small objects such as this dust mite  
can be seen in astonishing detail.
Optical microscopes
Like all early microscopes, this 1670 model 
used by English scientist Robert Hooke  
is an example of an optical microscope. 
It features a series of lenses in a 
barrel. The lens closest to the object 
being studied focuses light to  
form a magnified image,  
which can then be magnified  
further by an ocular lens 
(eyepiece). Still widely used 
by scientists, modern 
optical microscopes can 
reach magnification of 
up to 1,000 times.

Laser surgery
Lasers also perform valuable medical

blood vessels and act as a highly 
accurate scalpel, destroying harmful 
or diseased cells with precision.

Laser
Cutting-edge technology
Today, many different kinds of lasers are produced  
to perform dozens of different tasks. IndustrIal 
lasers wielded by robots (above) can be focused 
tightly on a single spot to drill holes or cut through 
thick metal and other tough materials accurately. 
Some lasers are used to weld metals together or to 
etch electronic circuits.
First laser 
The first working laser was 
produced in 1960. A ruby 
crystal rod (above) was placed 
inside a photographer’s flash 
bulb. When the atoms in the rod 
were excited by the light from 
the flash, they generated energy 
as an intense pulse of red light.  
The ruby laser was a research 
tool, without a practical use.
In addition to their use  
in industry and surgery, 
lasers are used in all kinds 
of objects, from CD players 
to laser printers.

the math symbol for an 
unknown number. In some 
languages, they’re known  
as Röntgen rays.
Stethoscope  
ear tips go in  
the doctor’s 
ears to transmit 
your breathing

X-ray
In 1895, German physicist Wilhelm Conrad 
Röntgen was experimenting with light tubes 
similar to fluorescent bulbs when, by 
accident, he discovered mysterious waves of 
energy he called X-Rays. Röntgen found that 
they passed through flesh and other soft 
parts of the body but not through metal or 
bones. When a special film is placed behind 
the body, it can capture an X-ray image. 
X-rays are now used to help find broken 
bones and pinpoint foreign objects, such  
as bullets, inside the body.
Stethoscope
Stethoscopes let doctors check for 
problems by listening to a patient’s 
heartbeat and breathing as well as 
the sound of blood rushing around 
blood vessels. French doctor René 
LaenneC invented the first 
stethoscope, a simple wooden tube, in 
1816. Modern stethoscopes have a 
diaphragm that picks up sounds and 
makes them louder before they 
travel to the doctor’s ears.

Stethoscope diaphragm  
is placed on the skin 
closest to the part of

Ultrasound
Sounds higher than those you can hear are called 
ultrasound. An ultrasound scanner sends 
these sounds into a patient’s body. Different 
types of tissue such as bone or muscle produce 
a different echo. The machine listens to the 
different echoes and builds up a picture called 
an echogram or sonogram. The first sonogram 
was produced in 1958. Ultrasound is often  
used to check on babies in the womb. 
MRI scan
When placed in a magnetic field and bombarded 
with radio waves, atoms in your body answer 
back. The tiny signals they give off can be 
gathered and turned into a detailed picture of 
what’s going on inside the body using Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI). The first MRI 
scanner to perform a full scan of the body 
was invented by American professor 
raymond V. damadian in 1977.
Fiber-optic endoscope
An endoscope is a narrow, flexible 
tube that travels inside part of your body 
so that doctors can take a good look. 
Researchers at the uniVersity of 
alabama invented the first fiber-optic 
endoscope in 1957. They contain 
bundles of thousands of thin glass 
fibers, which carry images from inside 
your body to be displayed on a screen.

Aspirin
The handy, HUMBLE PILL that gives 
fevers and headaches the old heave-ho 
Barking up the right tree
Salicylic acid is a substance that 
helps reduce pain in the body’s nerve 
endings. This means it’s good at 
relieving such common complaints as 
headaches, swellings, and muscle aches. 
Some plants, such as meadowsweet and 
the bark of the willow tree, are rich in 
salicylic acid. Willow bark was used as 
a remedy for fever in ancient Greece, 
more than two thousand years ago.
Mixing it up
Salicylic acid taSted awful and 
could cause vomiting and stomach 
pain, so various chemists in the 
19th century worked to find ways 
to remove its bad side effects.  
In 1897, chemists in Germany 
produced acetylsalicylic acid 
(ASA), which caused fewer 
side effects but was 
still an effective pain 
reliever.  German 
chemical company 
Friedrich Bayer & Co. 
began selling ASA in 
1899 under the brand 
name aSpirin.
Wonder drug
In 1900, aspirin was first 
sold as tablets that dissolve 
in water, the first medicine  
to be sold in this form. It was 
taken to ease headacheS and 
feverS, and by people who suffered 
from rheumatism to reduce pain in 
their joints. More recent research 
suggests that aspirin can help prevent 
blood clotting and may even have a 
role in fighting Alzheimer’s disease 
and certain cancers.
Willow bark chips 
were used as an 
herbal remedy.
Aspirin was first 
sold as a powder  
in tins.
Tablets contain a set 
dose of aspirin mixed with 
corn starch and water.
Plastic bottle 
often comes with a 
childproof lid.
Aspirin is now the most 
widely used drug for pain 
relief in the world. Around 
100 billion tablets are  
taken every year.

Defibrillator
The SHOCKING invention that saves  
lives by restarting hearts
Paddles are placed on 
the patient’s body. 
Shocking story
Scientists in the 19th and early 20th centuries 
learned that an electric shock could restart 
a heart or correct it when it started beating 
abnormally. The first defibrillators passed an 
electric current through wires touching the 
heart and could be used only in hospitals 
during an operation. 
Closed chest
Closed-chest defibrillators 
can correct heart rhythms 
or restart a heart without 
the body being opened 
up. The first units were 
huge, expensive, and 
needed to be plugged in.  
In 1965, Northern Irish 
doctor Frank pantridge  
built a defibrillator powered 
by car batteries and developed 
smaller, portable models to be 
carried in ambulances.
Modern design
Modern defibrillators are 
lightweight and found in many 
places, from swimming pools to 
schools, not just in hospitals. 
Some give spoken instructions 
so that any adult can use them  
in an emergency. 
An electric current 
flows between the 
two paddles and 
through the heart.
Instructions show  
the user how to 
operate the equipment.

Variolation
In the 10th century, the Chinese began 
a simple form of vaccination called 
variolation. They exposed healthy 
people to the disease smallpox, in  
the hope that they would catch a milder 
version and, after recovery, become 
immune. A piece of a scab would be 
placed under the skin, or ground up 
and blown up a patient’s nose. The 
practice spread to Europe, but the 
method was unreliable and could lead 
to the spread of other diseases. 
Vaccination
vaccination exposes a person to a mild 
form of a disease, so that his or her body 
learns to fight the disease in the future.
The sharpest way to provide PROTECTION against infection
This pin device was used  
in 18th-century Europe to 
move infected tissue from 
one person to another.
Milkmaids often caught 
cowpox, a disease caused 
by a virus related to but 
much milder than  
deadly smallpox.
Dairy cows carried 
the cowpox virus  
on their udders.
In 1853, French doctor Charles 
Pravaz invented the practical  
metal hypodeRmic syRinge. Used to 
administer vaccines, it uses a  
hollow needle to pierce the skin.

Risky research
In the 18th century, smallpox was a major 
killer: Around 400,000 people died of the disease 
every year in Europe alone. In 1796, English doctor 
edward jenner infected an eight-year-old boy with 
a small amount of cowpox pus. Cowpox was similar 
to smallpox but much less dangerous. Success!  
The boy later proved to be 
immune to smallpox. 
Swiss-born doctor 
AlexAndre Yersin  
created a vaccine 
against diphtheriA and  
in 1894 discovered the 
Yersinia pestis bacteria 
that caused bubonic plAgue. 
hiV is a devastating virus 
that breaks down the 
human body’s immune 
system. MAssiVe reseArch  
is ongoing to discover a 
vaccine against HIV. 
Vaccination station
A century later, French chemist louis Pasteur 
made the next major breakthrough. In 1885,  
a young boy suffering from rabies arrived at 
his lab close to death. Pasteur had been 
experimenting with turning a weakened 
form of rabies into a vaccine, and gave the 
boy a series of injections. The boy 
regained full health, Pasteur went  
on to vaccinate thousands of people,  
and today many vaccines are still  
made using his methods.

I sometimes vaccinated as 
many as 200 people a day.  
I also came up with the word, 
vaccine from “vacca,” the 
Latin word for cow. 
Many were horrified at Jenner’s work, but 
vaccination caught on. In 1979, the World 
Health Organization declared that 
smallpox had finally been 
wiped out. Pasteur’s work 
led to research into other 
vaccines, and today 
we are protected 
against many 
once-common 
killers.
How it changed 
 the world
Edward Jenner 
realized that milkmaids 
who had caught cowpox 
were subsequently 
immune to smallpox.

Poorly performing parts 
can be replaced by these 
medical miracles.
The ball of the prosthetic 
hip joint fits into the 
socket in the pelvis.
The spiked end is  
fitted into a hole  
drilled in the femur  
(upper leg bone).
Artificial limbs
The first known prosthesis 
(artificial body part) was a 
wooden toe found on a 
2,700-year-old Egyptian mummy.  
Since that time, artificial hands, feet, 
arms, and legs have all been made. Early 
ones were forged from metal or carved from 
wood. Some wooden hands (above) had 
hinged finger joints and could be locked  
in a gripping position to hold objects. 
Hearing aid
Early hearing aids were big funnels 
called ear trumPets that channelled sound 
waves from the air into the ear. Some were 
made from silver and decorated ornately, 
while others were hidden in walking sticks 
so users could be more discreet. Modern 
hearing aids use a microphone to pick 
up sounds and an electronic amplifier 
to make them louder, before they are 
replayed close to or inside the ear.

Dentures
Many kinds of false teeth, also known as 
dentures, have been in use over centuries.  
The Etruscans in northern Italy made dentures from 
human and animal teeth starting in 700 bce. George 
Washington, the first president of the United States, 
wore dentures carved out of hippopotamus ivory 
and held in place by springs made of gold wire. 
Modern dentures are made from plastics, and are 
colored and shaped to look like the real thing. 
Contact lenses
Early contact lenses were made of hard 
glass and were often very uncomfortable to 
wear. Czech chemist Otto Wichterle 
experimented at home with hydrogels (types 
of polymer material that hold water). In 1961, 
he built a machine on his kitchen table out of 
parts from a child’s construction kit and a 
record player motor. It spun out tiny disks of 
the material, which formed the first 
comfortable soft contact lenses. 
Pacemaker
Some people’s hearts don’t beat at a healthy rate or 
rhythm. Pacemakers help by sending out small 
electrical pulses to stimulate the heart 
muscles. One of the first, built by Canadian  
John hopps in 1950, was the size of a toaster 
and needed to be plugged into a wall socket. 
Nine years later came a successful 
implantable pacemaker placed 
completely inside the body.  
Some patients lived for 30 years 
with this model, developed by 
Americans Wilson greatbatch  
and William chardack.

Many clothing manufacturers 
already sell stain-resistant clothes 
that contain tiny particles called 
nanowhiskers, which stop stains 
from sticking to the fabric.
There are 600 nanofoods on  
the market today, including a  
variety of canola oil that can  
block cholesterol from entering  
the bloodstream.

A nanometer is one-billionth  
of a meter or about the width of 
ten atoms. A single human hair 
is about 80,000 nanometers 
wide. Recent scientific advances 
mean that machines and 
materials are starting to be 
constructed on this 
phenomenally small scale.

Thinking small
The concepts behind nanotechnology 
were first discussed in 1959 by  
American physicist RichARd 
FeynmAn in his talk “There’s 
Plenty of Room at the Bottom.”  
He urged scientists to think  
small and build technology  
out of atoms. 
Scientists started at the micRoscAle, 
measured in thousandths of a millimeter, 
building motors, gears, electronic circuits, 
and even sunglasses for houseflies! 
Microprocessor chips found in smartphones and 
PCs feature millions of switches and circuits etched 
onto a circuit board smaller than a fingernail.

NaNoparticles of metal oxides 
are used in some suNscreeNs. 
They offer protection from the 
sun but don’t leave white 
marks on the skin.
GrapheNe is a remarkable 
material with many potential 
applications. It is made of carboN 
atoms joined in hexagons that 
form a surface a single atom thick.
Diseased cell
Nanobot 
injects treatment 
directly into cell.
This highly magnified 
view shows an 
STM’s needle.
Lifesaving nanobots 
Now that scientists are able to work on the 
nanoscale, the possibilities are endless.  
One key application in the future could be 
medical nanobots—tiny robots 
injected into the body. Some might 
scrub blood vessels clean of fats while 
others could repair damage from the 
inside, or track, capture, and deal 
with harmful bacteria or diseased 
cells (left). Swarms of nanobots 
might monitor you from the inside to 
give your body a continual checkup.
Marvelous microscope 
In 1981, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) 
was invented by German scientists Gerd binniG 
and HeinricH roHrer. It uses a needle tip just a 
few atoms wide to scan an object, tracing out the 
surface atoms and spaces between them to form an 
image. STMs work at incredible resolutions, capable 
of showing us individual atoms. They also allow 
scientists to work at the nanoscale directly, moving 
and manipulating individual atoms for the first time. 
Did you know?
These micro-cogs, shown 
here next to a fly’s leg, were 
made using techniques that 
can work at scales of 
thousandths of a millimeter.
How it changed
 
 
 
the world
The answer is…we don’t know yet, 
since all things nano are only just 
starting. But they could revolutionize 
the way we live in the future.

Total turkeys
For every high-flying GENIUS invention, there  
are countless other ones that never make  
it OFF THE GROUND. 
1801 Captain Dick’s Puffer
British inventor RichaRd TReviThick lost 
his train of thought when he left the engine  
of his first passenger steam carriage running 
while he stopped off for a quick drink. All  
the water in the engine boiled off and poor old 
Captain Dick’s Puffer exploded. But Trevithick 
got back on track two years later with his  
celebrated creation, the steam locomotive.
1862 Hunley’s submarine
American engineer Horace Hunley had that 
sinking feeling when his submarine came to  
a disastrous end during the the civil War. 
The underwater weapon had been developed 
from an old boiler and was aRmed WiTh a  
ToRpedo. Hunley’s design managed to sink an 
enemy ship, but the sub itself exploded at the 
same time, and joined its target on the seabed. 
1874 De Groof parachute
With his eyes firmly on the skies, Belgian 
Vincent De Groof longed to fly like a bird.  
His vision came to life with a Winged 
paRachuTe that he attached to a balloon  
to soar over London. When the wings fell  
apart midflight, the birdbrain’s feathers were  
truly ruffled. In a flap, he hit the ground, 
ending his dream and his life.
1880s Suitcase life jacket
A German named Krankel built a case for  
a life jacket—literally. His suitcase had two 
removable panels just in case of an emergency. 
Wearers took out the panels, blocked the hole 
with a rubber ring, and wriggled into the case. 
But carrying excess baggage didn’t float 
everyone’s boat and the invention quickly  
moved fRom suiTcase To nuTcase. 
 
1894 Maxim’s flying machine
American-born innovator hiRam maxim fired  
his way to success with the machine gun in  
1884, but he crashed with his attempt at a  
flying machine. Despite five sets of wings 
spanning 125 ft (38 m), two steam engines,  
and a pair of propellers, the machine took  
off from rails and flew briefly before coming  
back down to earth with a very big bump!
1896 Self-raising hat
Back in Victorian times,  
it was all the rage for 
gentlemen to tip their hats 
when passing ladies on the 
street. Hats off, then, to 
American James Boyle,  
who made mechanics do the 
hard work with his self-
tipping hat. When the wearer gave the nod, a 
clockwork device inside tipped the hat to the 
passing lady. Sadly for Boyle, the hat simply 
failed to raise the interest of customers, and it 
was hung up for good soon after. 
1896 Power shower
A lean machine for keeping clean was the 
brainchild of one particularly eager cyclist. It  
was basically a bicycle (without wheels) that  
used pedal power to pump water in the shower. 
The more pedaling, the stronger the power 
shower. Great for gym rats, but not so easy for 
couch potatoes. “You’re all wet!” was the  
general response to this fleeting fad.
 
The mechanism worked best with 
dome-shaped bowler hats.

1903 Chicken glasses
American Andrew Jackson (no relation to the 
president!) developed protective glasses for his 
feathered friends to wear to stop them from 
hurting each other’s eyes. Jackson assumed his 
sight-saving invention would provide a good 
nest egg, but it’s a mistake to count your 
chickens before they hatch. Although some 
glasses were sold at the turn of the century,  
they are now nowhere to be seen. 
1922 Baby cage 
For nannies left holding the baby in high-rise 
buildings, one last resort was an outdoor  
cage where you could put a baby. American 
inventor Emma REad’s intentions were good:  
The plan was to give babies fresh air and room  
to play. In reality, though, there was a lot of 
rattling of cages and baby blues all around. 
1960 Smell-o-Vision
American movie maestro Mike Todd, Jr., believed  
he was on to the sweet smell of success with 
Smell-o-Vision. This new technology released 
odors during the showing of films to enhance the 
experience. Scent of Mystery was the only film to 
use Smell-o-Vision, and it was an absolute stinker. 
Audiences turned their noses up at the gimmick 
and Todd had to wake up and smell the coffee. 
1962 Robot Readamatic
This robotic reading device was designed to 
speed up bookworms. At the turn of a dial, one 
line of text was displayed at a time. Although 
meant to increase the reader’s pace, the design 
was fatally flawEd, since the machine’s 
loud whirring sound and distracting mechanical 
arm had users throwing the book at the invention. 
1976 Rolling ball
Italian alEssandRo dandini came up with  
a bizarre new vessel for transporting cargo 
across the sea. He devised a plan to use a big 
motorized ball with two cabins attached to 
either side. Cargo could be stored inside the 
sphere or the cabins. However, the tipping point 
came when one cabin was detached, causing the 
whole craft to flip on its side. As a result, the 
marine machine didn’t make its rounds for long.
1980s Nimslo 3-D camera
The combined efforts of American photography 
enthusiasts Jerry Nims and Allen Lo produced 
the Nimslo 3-D camera. The snap-happy device 
used four lenses, each taking one frame at a 
slightly different angle to make one 3-D image. 
Unfortunately, the creators hadn’t focused on the 
bigger picture. At tEn timEs thE pRicE of a 
normal camera, consumers said no to Nimslo. 
1982 APT
The Advanced Passenger Train was designed  
to tilt as it traveled around corners, but the idea 
went off the rails from the get-go. All the tipping 
and dipping at high speeds had passengers 
reaching for sick bags, frozen brakes posed a 
problem in cold spells, and some parts of the 
design got stuck at a slant! The tilting train was 
going nowhERE. 
2007 Phone Fingers
When Austrian philipp ZumtobEl pointed a 
finger at the problem of smudges and marks on 
smartphones, his solution took the form of an 
accessory called Phone Fingers. These tight-
fitting rubber finger covers are rolled onto the 
user’s digits to keep keypads clean. However, the 
public gave the idea a thumbs down—most 
phone users fixed the original problem by 
simply washing their hands. 
Phone Fingers were too  
difficult to get on and off.

Fantastic future
Nobody really knows what the great 
inventions of the FUTURE might be, but 
here’s some that just might make the grade. 
Space tourism
Thousands of space cadets have put their names 
down to boldly go where no man has gone 
before, with one-way trips to Mars scheduled 
for a decade in the future. The intention is to 
establish a colony on the red planet—the first 
human settlement outside of Earth. 
Human clones
It all began in 1997 when Dolly the sheep 
became the first animal clone (identical replica 
of an existing organism). Pigs, cows, dogs, and 
mice have since entered the clone zone, and now 
there’s talk of cloning people. However, many 
governments have banned this controversial 
concept, preferring not to meddle with nature.
Hoverbike
High-tech hoverbikes could soon help commuters 
rise above the morning rat race. Powered 
by light jet engines, this invention could 
float way above the traffic, taking the 
driver directly to his or  
her destination. As the 
world’s roads become 
increasingly jammed, 
hoverbike users could 
fly free as birds.
Sonic washer
Future washing machines may use ultrasound 
and static electricity, rather than soap and 
water. Popping ultrasound waves into your dirty 
laundry would free the filth, while 
electrostatic attractors zapped it away, trapping 
grime in a murky mess at the bottom.
Silent planes
Noisy air traffic can be a real headache for 
people living under flight paths. In the future, 
those on the ground may enjoy the sound of 
silence, thanks to the work of Cambridge 
University in England and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. These educational forces 
are off to a flying start with a new aircraft 
so quiet that no one outside of an airport can 
hear it. In addition to bringing peace and 
harmony, this is an eco-friendly option, 
burning far less fuel than today’s aircraft.
Toothphone
Here’s a hands-free invention to really sink  
your teeth into. Inventors are researching a 
toothphone to direct-dial your pearly whites.  
With a mini-microchip placed in one of your 
teeth, incoming calls would be transmitted by 
sending vibrations along the jaw straight into 
your ear. No more choosing handsets and 
phone covers! Just brush up on your dental 
hygiene to ensure that your toothphone 
remains on call.
Robot sports coaches
When you’re going for the gold playing your 
favorite sport, you don’t want a slow coach. To 
be the best, try hands-on training from fully 
computerized sports coaches. At 7 ft (2.1 m) 
tall, Robo-Coach is 10 times stronger than the 
average person. It can play any sport for  
36 hours nonstop before the batteries run 
out. Video cameras record performances and can 
be played back in 3-D on the robot’s chest. If a 
session with Robo-Coach leaves you exhausted,  
it will even give you a relaxing massage.

High-altitude wind power
When it comes to harnessing the world’s 
natural energy resources, the answer is 
blowing in the wind. Traditionally, wind power 
is generated from turbines on Earth, but high 
above Earth’s surface wind speeds are much 
faster, peaking in the jet streams of 5 miles  
(8 km) and above. Environmental agencies are 
blown away by the idea of airborne 
turbines suspended high up in the air but 
tethered to the ground. With costly maintenance 
and aviation interference to consider, inventors 
are still shooting the breeze on this gusty idea.
Invisibility cloak
Ever wish you could be invisible, just like  
Harry Potter? In 2012, researchers from Duke 
University made a small 3-D object invisible 
using a flexible fabric called Meta-flex. 
Although the object disappeared as if by magic, 
it was really a trick of the light. The illusion 
worked because the fabric bent light away  
from the eyes and sent it around the object 
instead, making it seem as though nothing  
was there. The next stroke of wizardry is to 
make people invisible, and inventors claim  
to have this within their sights. 
Brain implants
When you’re lacking in gray matter, imagine 
plugging in an intellectual implant to boost 
your brainpower in an instant. This mastermind 
module has already worked with primates, when 
implants were attached to the prefrontal 
cortex (the area for thought, memory, and 
attention) of their brains. The decision-making 
skills of Rhesus monkeys improved by 10 percent. 
Researchers hope to adapt the implant for 
humans, taking the wearer from birdbrain to 
egghead in one smooth move. 
Video tattoos
Picture this—an electronic display printed on 
a fine plastic membrane and placed over your 
skin. This makes your body a blank canvas, 
able to showcase computer displays and change 
them to suit your mood. The electronic version 
moves and stretches without breaking, and if 
you ever regret that tattoo of your dead tortoise, 
it’s not permanent! 
Exoskeleton clothing
If your childhood wish was to be a superhero 
with special powers, an exoskeleton could 
make your dream come true. This body armor 
makes the wearer as brawny as Batman. The 
superstrength clothing is made from polymer 
gel muscles, which are five times stronger than 
natural fibers. These costly costumes will come 
down in price in the future, making them ideal 
protection for the military and police forces. 
Air-conditioned suits
Keeping cool while suited up is a problem for 
business people in hot cliMates. However,  
a new wardrobe winner is coming on the 
fashion scene. A suit jacket, secretly home to 
two tiny fans that suck in air to evaporate 
perspiration, will help keep business brains 
cool even when the temperature rises. The 
manufacturers claim that this is a small-scale, 
low-cost, and environmentally friendly 
alternative to air-conditioning units.
Artificial meat
The invention of lab-grown Meat 
could one day take animals off the 
menu. Cells can now be taken from 
live animals and put in an environment 
where they are cultivated separately.  
In August 2013, a Dutch design team 
served the first artificial 
haMburger at a London launch.  
If customers get a taste for this cultured 
cuisine, fake meat could go whole  
hog and turn into a supermarket 
staple. Right now, though, this 
protein is too pricey to be 
mainstream fodder.
