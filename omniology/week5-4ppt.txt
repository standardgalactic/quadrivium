Pulmonary Function Tests  
(FVC and FEV1) 
•
Forced Vital Capacity = maximal volume of air exhaled after a 
maximal inspiration. 
 
•
Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) = individual 
takes a maximal inspiration and then exhales as fast as 
possible. The important value is the fraction of the total forced 
vital capacity expired in 1 second. Normal individuals expire 
approx. 80% of their vital capacity in this time.  
 
•
Pulmonary function tests differentiate: 
 
  
 
 Obstructive lung disease: FEV1/FVC < 80%   
 
  
 
 
 normal forced vital capacity (FVC). 
 
 
 Restrictive lung disease: normal FEV1/FVC = 80%  
 
  
 
 
reduced forced vital capacity (FVC).

Inspired air is diluted by the air remaining in the lungs from the previous breathing cycle.

Minute Ventilation (VE) = Tidal Volume (TV) x Respiratory Rate (f)  
 
 
 
Anatomic Dead Space (VD) = volume in conducting airways (approx. 150 mL); no exchange of gas with 
blood.  (physiological dead space = anatomic and alveolar dead spaces) 
**Alveolar Ventilation (VA) = [Tidal Volume (TV) – dead space (VD)] x f

Gas Partial Pressures  
•
Ambient air is a gas mixture of mostly nitrogen (79%) and 
oxygen (21%), carbon dioxide is low (0.04%).  
 
•
Gas mixtures obey Dalton’s Law which states: 
 
  sum of the partial pressures of gases = total pressure.  
 
•
PO2= FiO2 x Patm = (0.21 x 760) = 160 mmHg  
 
•
Inspired gas is warmed and humidified:  
 
Water vapor pressure = 47 mmHg therefore, 
 
 PO2 of inspired air is 0.21 x (760 - 47) = 150 mmHg 
 
 
 

**Alveolar gas pressures determine 
systemic arterial blood gas pressures. 
Alveolar Gas Pressure 
Atmosphere     PO2 = 160 mmHg  PCO2 = 0.3 mmHg 
 
Alveoli  
      PAO2 = 105 mmHg   PACO2 = 40 mmHg 
 
Arteries 
      PaO2 = 100 mmHg   PaCO2 = 40 mmHg 
 
Veins  
       PvO2 = 40 mmHg  PvCO2 = 46 mmHg 

Key Concepts 
 
•
Ventilation is the process of moving air into and 
out of the lungs. Minute ventilation is the total 
volume of air moved per minute. Alveolar 
ventilation is the volume of fresh air that 
reaches the alveoli per minute.   
 
•
Dead space volume represents the volume in the 
conducting zone and does not participate in gas 
exchange. Physiologic dead space includes the 
anatomical dead space and areas of the lung 
that are either not ventilated or not perfused.
