C
an science teach us about the emotional skill sets that are 
most important for professional and personal success? Can 
you improve your own emotional skills or the skills of others? 
The answer to both of these questions is unequivocally yes, but there’s 
a lot of science and myth to untangle. In this broad, evidence-based 
course, you will explore the rich and complex world of emotions and 

Scope

emotion regulation and how emotions are almost continually at play 
in our lives. This material will be presented through the framework 
of emotional intelligence, or EQ—a concept made popular in the 
late 1990s, when it was lauded as the most important ingredient for 
success. This course will separate fact from fiction and demonstrate 
how a robust research literature can still point us to impressive and 
important findings that we can apply to everyday life.
In this course, you will learn how to assess your own EQ. You will 
build skills for emotional intelligence to improve your workplace 
interactions, your relationships with family and friends, and even 
your mental and physical well-being. Far from being a distraction 
from the business of living, research suggests that knowing how to 
manage your emotions—your EQ—is a critical, teachable skill with the 
potential to change your life. 
This course is divided into 5 sections. The first section, which is about 
emotions and EQ fundamentals, you will explore the history and 
basic concept of EQ. You will learn how to measure your own EQ 
and how to evaluate the quality of the many EQ quizzes and surveys 
that exist. You will explore the phenomenon called emotions and how 
they relate to our brains, minds, and bodies. This section ends with a 
more critical look at the impacts of emotions in multiple life domains. 
Emotions may not be the only factor at play in our lives, but they are 
commonly the center point of our experiences. 
In section 2, you will explore specific EQ abilities and skills and how 
they develop. You will focus on the 4-branch model of EQ, which 
includes the ability to perceive and express emotions, use emotions 
to facilitate memory and decision making, understand emotions, 
and regulate emotions in the self and others. The origins of EQ—
what little we know—are discussed, along with the potential of EQ 
training programs (socioemotional learning) delivered by parents 
and schools. 
Section 3, which is about EQ in relationships, introduces the related 
but distinct concept of social intelligence using current examples 
of political conflict, racial tension, and anger management. Emotion 
regulation and communication skills are presented as possible tools 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence

to facilitate conflict resolution, deepen intimacy, and promote a sense 
of shared responsibility and commitment. 
EQ in the workplace is explored in section 4. Many of us spend 
(or have spent) a large percentage of our lives in the workplace 
and are well acquainted with how emotions can help or hinder our 
professional accomplishments. This section turns to the business 
school literature, using case studies and even specific business EQ 
assessment tools that highlight why emotion regulation skills in the 
workplace are critical to prevent burnout and promote success. What 
makes a great leader? How can we change workplace culture? These 
and other questions are addressed.
In the final section, on EQ and health, you will analyze the role of 
emotions in health-related behaviors such as smoking and drinking 
alcohol, emotions and willpower, and emotion dysregulation in 
distress disorders such as depression and anxiety. You will learn about 
new psychotherapies that specifically target emotion regulation 
skills, such as dialectic behavioral therapy and emotional regulation 
therapy. You will explore the link between the management of chronic 
diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease and emotion 
regulation skills, and you will discover how to harness emotions to get 
the most out of your health-care team. The course ends by looking at 
exciting and somewhat-disturbing technological applications of EQ 
that are emerging in the near future.

his course on emotional intelligence, or EQ, will tackle the 
important question of how to regulate, or even use, your 
emotions to your best advantage. The course will address 
emotions and their relation to physical health, relationships, and 
communities. As part of this journey, you will explore biology, 
cognition, culture, and even new digital tools intended to make you 
more emotionally skilled. In this lecture, you will learn about the 
history and meaning of the construct of emotional intelligence.

The History of EQ
●
●
The topic of emotional intelligence often triggers personal 
reactions. It’s easy to relate to, but it might evoke pain, pleasure, 
defensiveness, or moral judgment. This makes it essential to keep 
an open mind and to use any evoked emotions or cognitions as 
grist for the mill. Observe them, study them, and decide if you 
want to change them. 
●
●
Emotional intelligence is the mental ability that lurks amid the 
emotions. The goal of this course is to provide a sort of emotional 
GPS, a navigational tool—but ultimately your destination depends 
on where you choose to go. 
●
●
Emotions have been the subject of research, philosophy, art, and 
music for centuries. Even the ancient Greeks were writing about 
“temperaments” and their relationship to the 4 humoral elements 
of life: yellow bile, black bile, phlegm, and blood—all predictive 
of emotional experience depending on how they were balanced. 
We see the emergence of Stoicism and the primacy of rationality 
with philosophers such as Socrates.
●
●
The Apollonian approach to life was pushing back. Emotions were 
to be tamed and controlled. Plato and Aristotle saw emotions 
as more than feelings or passions and argued that they include 
cognition and even affect our sensory perceptions and health. 
●
●
Christianity developed its own ideologies about emotions and, for 
the most part, saw the passions as something to be overcome. 
You turn the other cheek, love one another, and live a life of 
compassion and kindness while suppressing envy, anger, and lust. 
●
●
Reflecting on all of these complex and interesting historical and 
cultural influences is important because it helps you understand 
where your current beliefs and rules about emotions come from, 
and by knowing where they come from, you might have an easier 
time of deciding if you want to keep or change them.

Lecture 1 | What Is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?

●
●
Western psychology began exploring emotions in earnest in 
the early 20th century. Carl Jung suggested that some people 
rely heavily on a “feeling” function to perceive and understand 
the world. This system was used by a mother-daughter team to 
create the Myers-Briggs personality inventory. 
●
●
The neo-Freudian psychoanalysts of the 1940s and 1950s 
talked about insight and understanding of emotions that may 
have been warped by psychological defenses. Carl Rogers, a 
humanistic psychologist, taught us about the emotional power 
of unconditional positive regard and empathy and how they 
influence relationships and have the power to heal. 
●
●
But EQ isn’t just about emotions. It is also about intelligence. 
Intelligence, too, has a very long and interesting history, starting 
with Pythagoras, who describes intelligence as “winds,” or 
Descartes, who tells us that intelligence is simply the ability to tell 
the difference between true and false. 
●
●
The definition of intelligence that is probably most cited in modern 
times is that of David Wechsler, who said intelligence is “the 
aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, 
to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment.” 
Although rationality is called out, emotions aren’t excluded. 
As early as 1940, he referred to “non-intellective” as well as 
“intellective” elements, by which he meant affective, personal, and 
social factors. But where exactly does intelligence come from? 
●
●
When considering the etiology or origin of a trait or skill or 
even a disease or condition, we can consult the biopsychosocial 
model, which reminds us to consider variables that occur in 3 
overlapping categories: biological, psychological, and social. 
For intelligence, this remind us that our genetic inheritance 
undoubtedly plays a role. 
●
●
We can also consider the classic enriched environment studies 
of Mark Rosenzweig in the 1960s. These studies compared the

development of intelligence in rats raised in enriched versus 
impoverished environments. 
●
●
We now know that parental attention, environmental stimuli, 
preschool programs, and the like are important in developing 
neural growth and IQ in our children. We’ve learned that exercise, 
nutrition, and stressors—particularly early childhood poverty, 
neglect, and violence—can have profound effects on IQ. 
●
●
IQ has been shown to be associated with morbidity and mortality, 
social status, and academic performance. There are weaker links 
to success and really no link to relationships or quality of life. 
Although important, IQ isn’t the full story—or maybe not even 
half the story—of why some people succeed where others fail. 
EQ Models
●
●
In 1990, Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer published their first 
paper on emotional intelligence, effectively melding the emotion 
and intelligence literatures from an academic perspective. They

story—or maybe not 
even half the story—

succeed where

have since gone on to develop assessment measures and a 
careful body of research looking at the construct of EQ. 
●
●
Most people heard about EQ in the mid-1990s with the 
publication of Daniel Goleman’s book Emotional Intelligence, 
followed by the cover of TIME magazine that proclaimed that EQ 
“may be the best predictor of success in life, redefining what it 
means to be smart.”
●
●
There are 3 leading theories of EQ: those developed by 
Salovey’s group at Yale University (the integrative ability model), 
Goleman’s model, and the model developed by Reuven Bar-On 
that goes a bit further to include both abilities and personality 
traits (the mixed model). 
The Integrative Ability Model

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
9
●
●
The definition of EQ as developed by Salovey and Mayer along 
with another Yale faculty member, David Caruso, is “the ability 
to perceive and express emotion, assimilate emotion in thought, 
understand and reason with emotion, and regulate emotion in 
the self and others.” 
●
●
Note 4 elements, defined as abilities or skills that can be trained: 
the ability to express and perceive emotion, use emotion (harness 
for cognitive tasks), understand and reason with emotion, and 
regulate or manage emotion in the self and others.
●
●
The regulation of emotion has emerged as a core element 
in understanding basic psychological processes and even 
psychopathology. According to James Gross at Stanford, 
emotional regulation is conceptualized as the process of “shaping 
which emotions one has, when one has them, and how one 
experiences or expresses these emotions.”
●
●
In 1995, Goleman’s popular book, Emotional Intelligence, 
came out. He conceptualized EQ as a set of skills and personal 
competencies. He described 5 domains that included knowing 
your emotions, managing your own emotions, motivating 
yourself by marshaling emotions (such as delaying gratification 
or entering flow states), recognizing and understanding other 
people’s emotions, and managing relationships. 
●
●
While there are overlaps with the Salovey model, Goleman 
brings in motivation and interpersonal relationships, ideas that 
really resonated with the business community. He more strongly 
believes that we need to control and “regulate” our emotions, 
which might explain his ongoing interest in meditation. 
●
●
In his book, Goleman claims that “at best IQ contributes about 
20% to the factors that determine life success,” which implies 
that 80% is EQ—a claim that was erroneously repeated on the 
cover of TIME magazine. These misimpressions were addressed 
in the introduction to the 2005 reedition of his book. 

Lecture 1 | What Is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?
10
●
●
The third EQ model was developed by Reuven Bar-On, who 
defines emotional intelligence as “an array of noncognitive 
capabilities, competencies, and skills that influence one’s ability to 
succeed in coping with environmental demands and pressures.”
●
●
The Bar-On model of 1997 includes intrapersonal skills (such as 
self-awareness and independence), interpersonal skills (such as 
empathy), adaptability (such as flexibility and problem solving), 
stress management, general mood (such as happiness and 
optimism), and traits (such as extroversion or neuroticism).
●
●
The big difference with this model is the intentional inclusion 
of personality traits, IQ, and other cognitive skills. While some 
people see this as the most complete picture of EQ, many find it 
too overlapping with other, better-defined constructs. Besides, if 
it’s a trait, then it probably can’t be changed. 
Emotion Self-Monitoring
●
●
Start with some informal emotion self-monitoring by paying 
attention to your own emotional states, including where they 
occur, what triggers them, and what happens once they are 
active. Consider keeping a log or maybe just jotting down 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
11
a few notes. Eventually, the goal is to look for patterns and 
opportunities.
●
●
A word of caution about emotional perfectionism: We shouldn’t 
expect ourselves to be positive and constructive all the time. Life 
is just too messy and complex for that. Emotions—both positive 
and negative—are important, have meaning, and are worth 
exploring.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Compare and contrast the 3 leading models of EQ. When 
would you want to use an ability model? When would a trait 
model be preferable?
2.	 Create a list of what you perceive to be your personal EQ 
strengths and challenges. What personal goals do you have 
in regard to improving your EQ? How will you measure your 
progress?

Lecture 2
Measuring EQ
T
his lecture will tackle how to measure emotional 
intelligence. Reliable measures of EQ are important for 
research—in terms of discovering what it predicts and how 
it can change—but also for clinical reasons. What are an individual’s 
particular strengths and weaknesses when dealing with emotions? 
EQ is complex and challenging to assess. The measure you 
choose in large part depends on the model of EQ that you follow. 
Ultimately, you need a better, more data-based sense of what you 
do well and what you do that might need some improvement.

EQ Testing
●
●
IQ testing typically takes about a half day, or at least several hours, 
and is composed of quite a few different subtests. You end up with 
an overall IQ, but you also have subscores for verbal IQ, memory 
recall, spatial reasoning, and other subtypes of intelligence. 
●
●
Most IQ tests—the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and 
the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale are probably the most 
common—are standardized to an average of 100 with a standard 
deviation of 15. In other words, anyone with an IQ between 85 
and 115 would be of average intelligence. Geniuses have IQs of 
more than 130, but a high IQ is not a guarantee of success. 
●
●
EQ is similar, but there are different models of EQ, such as the 
ability model of John D. Mayer, Peter Salovey, and David Caruso 
from Yale University; Bar-On’s model, which mixes traits and 
abilities; and Daniel Goleman’s more competency-focused model. 
●
●
Nearly every EQ measure is survey based. Some are taken by 
pen and paper, some are electronic, and some use video clips to 
get emotions stirred up first. Some are self-report, and some are 
essentially quizzes or exams. There are caveats that should go 
with any psychological survey, whether it is EQ or not. 
●
●
Psychometrics is essentially the statistics of tests—in this case, 
surveys. Psychometrics provides tools that allow us to assess 
the validity or quality of a survey. Even though survey studies 
are incredibly common, most surveys are atheoretical, poorly 
constructed, and fatally biased. How can you know when a survey 
is the real deal? 
●
●
Reliability is the extent to which repeatedly measuring the 
same property produces the same result. Validity is the extent 
to which a survey question measures the property that it is 
supposed to measure. Common issues that make a survey 
unreliable or invalid include demand characteristics, flawed 
questions, and sampling errors.

›
Demand characteristics refer to the effect that the test or 
testing environment has on the test taker. Does he or she feel 
comfortable to tell the truth? 
›
›
Flawed questions are often a result of the use of jargon, double-
barreled questions, or just poorly constructed sentences. 
›
›
Sampling errors result from having too few items or too few 
subjects to really be able to say anything definitively. 
●
●
When you are looking at a survey, perhaps something you find 
online, see what the generators of the survey have to say about the 
instruments reliability and validity. They may talk about test-retest 
reliability. If you take the test twice, how closely do your scores 
correlate? Often, they will report a statistic called Cronbach’s 
alpha, which essentially measures the intercorrelations of items 
within the test that are supposed to be measuring the same thing. 
In general, you want a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.7 or higher. 
Nearly every EQ 
measure is survey 
based. Some are 
taken by pen and 
paper, some are 
electronic, and some 
use video clips.

●
●
For our measures of EQ, we want the surveys to have high 
validity and reliability, and ideally they should report statistics 
such as Cronbach’s alpha with the survey. 
The MSCEIT
●
●
The most strongly theoretically based measure with the most 
extensive research support is called the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso 
Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). This test is based on their 
4-branch model of EQ: perception and expression of emotion, 
using emotion in thought, understanding and analyzing emotion, 
and management of emotion in the self and others.
●
●
The MSCEIT is a 141-item test mapped to each of the 4 branches. 
It takes about 30 to 45 minutes. Each branch has 2 tasks:
›
›
Perception: You look at faces, pictures, and landscape abstract 
images and have to be able to perceive the emotions that are 
communicated therein. 
›
›
Use: You talk about sensations that have to facilitate emotions 
in yourself or in others to influence cognition. 
›
›
Understanding: You read vignettes and understand different 
blends or ways to change emotions in others or the self. 
›
›
Management: You focus on how to solve those emotionally 
charged vignettes and scenarios. 
●
●
In statistical analyses of the MSCEIT, factor analysis really only 
supports 3 of the 4 branches. The second branch, using emotions 
to facilitate cognition, often gets absorbed.
●
●
MSCEIT scores are reported like IQ scores, so an average score 
is 100, and the standard deviation is 15. With this test, 68% of 
people fall within 1 standard deviation, and 95% of people fall 
within 2 standard deviations. You get a total EQ score, and you 
get 4 branches of scores. The test-retest reliability for this test is 
0.86, and it has a Cronbach’s alpha of around 0.8.

Lecture 2 | Measuring EQ

●
●
To find the MSCEIT, visit www.MHS.com. The test is sold in 
packages with users guides, score sheets, item booklets, etc. It 
will cost about $200 or more if you want a detailed report. 
The SSEIT
●
●
The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT), 
developed by Nicola Schutte and others, includes 33 items of 
one-factor solutions with 3 categories: perceiving and expressing 
emotions, regulating emotions, and utilizing emotions when 
solving problems. Note the overlaps with the Salovey model of 
emotional intelligence. 
●
●
Items on the Schutte test are rated on a scale of 1 to 5 from 
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Scores on the Schutte 
test have strong correlations with personality factors such 
as neuroticism and have a big overlap with personal wellness 
measures such as burnout. Those correlations can sometimes go 
up to as high as 0.7.
●
●
The test’s Cronbach’s alpha is 0.90, and its test-retest reliability 
is 0.78. It is free for research and clinical purposes. Go to 
www.scholar.google.com and type in “Schutte Self-Report 
Emotional Intelligence Test.” The PDF of her original paper is 
free and includes the scale. 
The ESCI
●
●
The measure of EQ developed by Daniel Goleman and Richard 
Boyatzis also concerns abilities but adds social competencies. He 
presented his model using a 2-by-2 grid. His newest assessment 
tool, the Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI), 
corresponds to this grid. 
●
●
The ESCI measures 12 competencies with 68 questions divided 
into 4 clusters corresponding to Goleman’s 2-by-2 EQ model: self-

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
17
awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship 
management.
●
●
The ESCI is the newer version of what used to be called the 
Emotional Competence Inventory 2.0. It is in improvement in 
that it collapsed the original 18 categories to 12 and improved 
the psychometrics. It has a Cronbach’s alpha of around 0.8 and 
a test-retest reliability of between 0.5 and 0.7, depending on the 
competency.
●
●
Google “ESCI Goleman” to get the PDF of the user manual, but 
you have to pay for the test and the scoring.
●
●
What’s new and interesting about the ESCI is that it is intended 
to be what’s called a 360° tool, which offers a full, circular view 
of someone. You fill out the measure yourself, but so do your 
coworkers, boss, friends, and anyone else. This has made the 
instrument popular in business settings to help employees—
especially managers and leaders—grow, and it is a staple for 
executive coaching. 
●
●
These types of 360° evaluations are becoming quite common, 
although research validating their use has been lagging thus far. 

Lecture 2 | Measuring EQ

The EQ-i
●
●
The Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), which was developed 
by Reuven Bar-On and first published in 1996, includes both 
abilities and traits. The original version of the EQ-i comprises 133 
items in the form of short sentences using a Likert scale ranging 
from “very seldom or not true of me” (1) to “very often true of me 
or true of me” (5).
●
●
You get a total score plus 15 subscales. There are correlations with 
depression and with measures of extroversion and introversion 
but almost no correlation with the MSCEIT.
●
●
The EQ-i is also owned by Multi-Health Systems (www.MHS.
com), so it is not available for free. If you purchase it, the EQ-i 2.0 
analyses 5 key areas: intrapersonal, interpersonal, adaptability, 
general mood, and stress management.
●
●
This test has a Cronbach’s alpha of between 0.8 and 0.9. The 
intrapersonal score has a negative correlation with neuroticism 
and depression. The interpersonal category correlates with 
The Emotional 
Quotient Inventory’s 
intrapersonal score has 
a negative correlation 
with neuroticism and 
depression.

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
19
extroversion but also with agreeableness and conscientiousness. 
The adaptation and stress management scores are very similar 
to the intrapersonal, so there are negative correlations with 
neuroticism and depression.
●
●
The EQ-i has been strongly criticized because of its strong 
overlap with standard measures of personality and mood and 
its lack of correlation with measures such as the MSCEIT. It’s 
measuring something, but is it EQ? It has also suffered from a 
lack of rigorous studies, and many of the publications using it are 
not peer-reviewed.

Another brief, free measure can be found on the Mind Tools 
website at https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/ei-quiz.htm. 
It only has 15 items and is based on Goleman’s competencies. This 
test has no known psychometrics, so it cannot be considered a 
valid or reliable measure, but it might still generate some interest. 
The TMMS
●
●
The Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) is a commonly used 
instrument that doesn’t give a global EQ score but does tap into 
2 key factors: attitudes and emotion regulation. The TTMS is a 
48-item self-report measure with 3 subscales based on the Mayer 
and Salovey model of EQ. 
●
●
The TMMS measures stable and general attitudes about moods 
and the degree to which individuals attempt to manage or 
repair mood experiences. It measures attention to moods, 

Lecture 2 | Measuring EQ
20
clarity (discrimination between moods), and regulation (repair 
of moods). It focuses on thoughts and attitudes regarding 
emotional experiences, so it only focuses on emotions that have 
already happened.
●
●
The overall coefficient alpha is adequate, at 0.82. There is 
no cost for using the TMMS. It has been widely used in basic 
emotion science research.

you feel most drawn to? Why? What dimension or additional 
questions might you add to it to improve it?
2.	 Do think people are naturally born with either high or low EQ? 
How or why? If it is inherited, can it still be changed?

Lecture 3
Exploring Emotions
I
n this lecture, you will take a deep dive into the raw material 
that makes our lives so much richer and more interesting: 
emotions. You will explore what is meant by emotions, 
including what they are, what they are for, and how we think, use, 
and experience them in our bodies. 

Lecture 3 | Exploring Emotions
22
Emotions
●
●
Our culture, like many, seems to have an ambivalent relationship 
with emotions. We may see them as the pinnacle of human 
experience: passion, love, joy—the stuff of poetry and plays and 
art. But we may also see them as a driving force for evil deeds, 
hate crimes, crimes of passion, or maybe even much of the pain 
and suffering in the world.
●
●
It can be argued that emotions—a priori—are neither good nor 
bad. They may be experienced as pleasant or distressing, but that 
doesn’t necessarily correspond with their value. Our goal is to 
understand the range of emotions we might experience and to 
achieve some clarity in why we have them and how to use them 
constructively. 
●
●
Emotions are typically defined as multifaceted, whole-body 
responses that involve coordinated changes in the domains of 
subjective experience, behavior, and peripheral physiology. 
●
●
Emotions arise when an individual attends to a situation 
and evaluates it as relevant to his or her goals. This definition 
presupposes a chronological sequence of events, involving, first, 
a real or imaginary situation; second, attention to and evaluation 
of the situation, where we need attention or focus (concentration) 
followed by a subjective cognitive appraisal; and third, an 
emotional response, which could be behavior, physiological 
changes, or following other urges the emotion generates. 
●
●
However, this emotion-generating process cycles pretty rapidly, 
and your responses feed back into the mix to shape subsequent 
cycles. This is why the way we respond emotionally is so important 
to understand and manage. 
●
●
This well-studied process is called the modal model of emotions 
and was developed by James Gross, an emotion science 
researcher at Stanford University. In this linear model, we move 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
23
from situation to attention and appraisal and then end with 
response. The response may then feed back to the situation. 
●
●
According to the model, emotions involve person-situation 
transactions that compel attention, have meaning in light of 
currently active goals, and give rise to coordinated multisystem 
responses that feed back into the process in important ways. 
›
›
Situation. The first step in the process is the situation. This refers 
to situation in its most obvious meaning: You are walking down 
the street and a growling dog jumps out at you. But situations 
can also be internal—something that is only happening in your 
mind. When we recall a memory or have a fantasy, our internal 
situation gets the emotions process going. 
›
›
Attention. You have to pay attention to what’s happening in 
the situation. There’s a lot of nuance to attention. Two people 
can be in exactly the same situation but can be attending to 
2 different things and having a very different experience. 
Moreover, energy goes where attention flows. Attention directs 
our limited resources, meaning we have less to do something 
else—learn, think, grow, change. Attention can be automatic, 
such as when we orient to a loud noise, but it can also be 
effortful and intentional, and it can take years to master. 
Attention can be 
automatic, but it can 
also be effortful and 
intentional.

Lecture 3 | Exploring Emotions
24
››
Appraisal. This is really what cognitive therapy is all about. An 
appraisal is a subjective assessment of a situation’s meaning in 
regard to relevant goals. It is influenced by the objective features 
of the situation, but there’s always a great deal of ambiguity. 
Why is that man smiling at me? Why didn’t my sister call me 
back? Our appraisals of the situation are very closely related to 
the subsequent emotional experience we will have. Cognitive 
behavioral therapy tells us that we develop habits in the ways we 
appraise events. The depressed person appraises rejection more 
often; the anxious person appraises more threat and danger. 
›
›
Response. This final step or outcome of the process includes 
experiential, behavioral, and neurobiological responses. There’s 
the effect of the emotion on your body—how it feels, the urge 
to run or fight, the butterflies in your stomach, the angry voice 
you use to lash back. The responses that are evoked often feed 
directly back into the situation and may escalate or defuse the 
emotion. 
●
●
Emotions motivate withdrawal or approach, and emotions are 
grounded in our personal goals. Emotions influence learning 
and memory and in this way can further exert an influence on 
motivation. 
●
●
Our object-recognition systems and spatial-processing systems 
address these questions: What is it? Where is it? Our emotion-
processing networks address these questions: Is it good for me? 
Is it bad for me? What should I do about it?
●
●
The ABCs of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) provide a linear 
model that helps us understand why particular consequences 
occur. The A is the antecedent, or trigger, or the situation in the 
modal model. The B is the belief or cognition; it would be called 
the appraisal in the modal model. The C is the consequences, 
which include emotions but also behaviors or even effects on 
your body. 
●
●
In CBT, you’re working on changing the beliefs or appraisals. 
In the CBT triangle, emotions are at the top, and thoughts and 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
25
behaviors are at the bottom. To understand emotions, we need 
to look at thoughts and behaviors.
●
●
As we consider the function of emotions, it is important to 
acknowledge and appreciate the incredible breadth of what we’re 
talking about. Emotions include everything from irritation at an 
email, amusement by a meme on social media, anxiety about a 
job evaluation, pleasure when enjoying a piece of dark chocolate, 
and hopefulness at a medical appointment to see if your cancer’s 
been cured. 
●
●
But despite all this breadth, emotions are goal directed. In each 
instance, there is an implicit or explicit goal. It may be long term 
or short term, realistic or aspirational, but there’s always a goal 
there. Knowing the goal helps you understand the emotion. 
Emotional Families
●
●
Is there a basic, universal set of emotions across cultures? If 
there is, which emotions are universal? There are approximately 
552 emotion words in the English language, so we need a much 
smaller set. 

Lecture 3 | Exploring Emotions
26
●
●
Paul Ekman, an emeritus professor at the University of California, 
San Francisco, addressed these questions by focusing on facial 
expressions, given that across all cultures all individuals have 
the same facial musculature. He took pictures of his graduate 
students making different facial expressions and then traveled to 
different countries and cultures around the world. 
●
●
For example, Ekman would show the picture of an angry face 
and ask people what just happened to the angry person. In their 
own language and terms, from their own cultural perspective, 
they would then tell a story that was representative of anger. 
●
●
After doing many iterations of this study, Ekman was able to 
deduce that there are 6 primary emotions, which he sometimes 
calls the 6 primary colors: happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, 
disgust, and fear. 
●
●
Because there are many more than 6 emotions, Ekman came up 
with the idea of blended emotions—such as envy, hope, despair, 
and love—that mix the basic emotions together in different 
proportions. For example, the emotion of contempt is most likely 
composed of a blend of anger and disgust. 
●
●
An interesting way to visualize the groupings or relationships 
between emotions is with the Atlas of Emotions, which was 
created by Paul Ekman and his daughter Eve. You can find it 
online for free at www.atlasofemotions.org.
●
●
What you will see are family groups of emotions, which will help 
build your emotional vocabulary, and you will see linkages to 
emotional states, actions, triggers, and moods. For example, if 
you click on “sadness,” you will see a range of sad-related states 
based on least to most intense, with disappointment listed as 
the least intense, resignation in the middle, and anguish as the 
most intense. It is a great tool to begin exploring emotions and 
to start building a foundation for more emotional awareness and 
emotional intelligence. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
27
●
●
We have a range of different emotions because each has a 
different function. Sadness is a consequence of loss. It triggers 
reflection and support seeking. Anger emerges in reaction to 
a perceived injustice or violation. It gives you anger to correct 
the wrong. Fear alerts you to a possible threat and tells you to 
flee or fight. As you explore the emotional families, consider 
their functions and how or when that might be helpful or hurtful. 
Emotions aren’t necessarily good or bad or true or false; they are 
helpful or not helpful. 
Continuum Models
●
●
A simpler and commonly used alternative model to the Atlas 
of Emotions is James Russell’s circumplex model of affect. In 
this model, 2 orthogonal lines create 4 quadrants, with level of 
arousal from high to low and valence from positive to negative. 
You can quickly assess your mood simply by placing a dot in 
one of the quadrants. Are you aroused? Are you feeling positive 
or negative? While this won’t get you far in understanding your 
emotion, it is a quick way to assess an emotional response you 
might be having and whether or not an emotional-regulation 
strategy you are trying out is working. 

Lecture 3 | Exploring Emotions
28
●
●
The most commonly used measure of positive and negative affect 
or emotion is the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), 
developed by David Watson, Lee Clark, and Auke Tellegen in 1988. 
The PANAS has 2 scales—positive and negative—and is composed 
of 20 items. The items present a single emotion or feeling words 
and ask how strongly you’ve felt that emotion in a specified time 
range. Examples include asking how much you have felt distressed, 
guilty, ashamed, hostile, interested, attentive, excited, enthusiastic, 
inspired, and proud. The PANAS is owned by the American 
Psychological Association, but there are a number of online sites 
that have posted the full scale if you are interested in taking it. 
●
●
Another quick but still interesting assessment tool is the 
Photographic Affect Meter (PAM), developed by J. P. Pollak. You 
typically get a text message telling you to check your mood. 
When you click on the app or the link, you see an array of pictures 
and you simply pick the one that matches your mood in that 
moment. The pictures are selected to represent all 4 quadrants 
of the circumplex model: positive and negative affect and high 
and low arousal. The PAM has shown good correlations with the 
PANAS, suggesting it might be a quick, cheap, and valid way to 
assess emotions in the moment.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Which universal emotion do you find most puzzling to 
understand or most difficult to express? Why? Where do you 
think that challenge comes from?
2.	 How does your cultural background influence your 
experience of the universal emotions? Do these cultural rules 
vary by gender or age?

Lecture 4
Embodied Emotions
I
n this lecture, you will dig deeper into the functions, and 
especially the bodily effects, of emotions. You will look more 
closely at whether there is a unique physiological signature 
for each emotion. By understanding how emotions affect our 
bodies, we might better understand why we have headaches, 
backaches, insomnia, sweaty palms, nausea, or even obesity, 
chronic pain, or ulcers. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
31
Bodily Senses
●
●
The embodied experience of emotions includes the effects 
emotions have on our bodies and how our bodies communicate 
or even alter our internal emotional experiences. There are a few 
perceptual systems that help us understand how we are able 
to sense our internal states, including those that are either the 
cause or effect of an emotion: interoception and proprioception.
●
●
Interoception is defined as the sense of the physiological 
condition of the body. It is a sense of knowing what your body 
feels like on the inside: Is your heart rate up or your temperature 
down? Are you hungry or thirsty? Most people don’t think of 
this as a sense, but in some ways it is, and like other senses, 
sometimes we are extra-sensitive and sometimes we aren’t. 
●
●
One aspect of emotional intelligence is having access to internal 
physiologic data while not allowing ourselves to be overwhelmed 
or to create additional and unnecessary arousal by being 
hypervigilant about our bodies. 
●
●
The most common way to measure your interoceptive skills is 
with the multidimensional assessment of interoceptive awareness 
(MAIA) scale, developed by Wolf Mehling. This survey is in the 
public domain and can be found online for free. It has 32 items 
rated from 0 to 5 that are used to create 8 different subscales. It 
is available in more than a dozen languages. 
●
●
There’s some interesting new work on how disrupted interoception 
may be part of substance use disorders or binge eating disorders. 
Interoception is defined as receiving, processing, and integrating 
sensory inputs from inside the body. If you are less able to tell 
that you are becoming impaired from alcohol or maybe unable 
to tell that you have already eaten too much, then the normal 
mechanisms that should slow you down aren’t able to kick in. 
●
●
The second bodily sense is proprioception, which is defined as 
your sense of position and movement. Position mostly refers to 

Lecture 4 | Embodied Emotions
32
your posture and the position of your body parts. Movement tells 
you how much strength or force you are using but also gives you 
information on velocity, trajectory, etc. 
●
●
Proprioception is critical for coordination and is something 
you might expect more of in an athlete or a ballet dancer, but 
it is another important feature of EQ. Through body language, 
our movement and position can communicate a great deal of 
emotional information. 
The James-Lange Theory of Emotion
●
●
From an embodied emotional sense, we want good interoception 
and proprioception both as data to be read but also as stimuli 
that may change our emotional state. Maybe the movement or 
sensation comes before the emotion is created. 
●
●
This idea comes from the James-Lange theory of emotion and 
gives us something called the facial feedback hypothesis. In this 
theory, there are 3 components of emotions: physiology, feeling, 
and behavior. William James and Carl Lange thought that 
physical expression and behavior actually precede the emotion. 
●
●
To test this, you’d need to first create a facial expression—for 
example, for happiness—to see if it actually created an emotion 
later: the “fake it ’til you make it” or “smile though your heart is 
breaking” idea. The problem is that if you tell someone to look 
happy, you’ve already tipped them off. 
●
●
Psychology researcher Robert Zajonc devised a clever experiment 
to avoid this. Half of the subjects held a pen between their teeth, 
forcing them to make a facial expression much like a smile. The 
other half of subjects held the pen in their pursed lips, indicating 
an expression of distaste. 
●
●
While holding the pen, both groups watched funny cartoons and 
were asked to rate their happiness and enjoyment. The teeth 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
33
holders were happier even though they were watching the same 
cartoons, providing at least some limited support for the facial 
feedback hypothesis. 
The Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion
●
●
Walter Cannon and Philip Bard believed that emotions originate 
in the central nervous system, with the resulting emotional 
experience growing out of unconscious neurological activity. The 
Cannon-Bard theory of emotion, developed in the 1920s, was 
based on the observation that people and animals with severed 
spinal cords could still experience emotions. Note that like the 
James-Lange theory, this theory focuses on physiology. 
●
●
Conceptually, it is easy to think of the brain in 3 parts, or what used 
to be called the triune brain. In the back and downward are the 

Lecture 4 | Embodied Emotions
34
brainstem and the midbrain, or what some have called the reptilian 
brain, because it is responsible for very basic and automatic 
functions. About in the center of our brains is the limbic system, or 
mammalian brain, which contains a number of structures relevant 
to emotion, including the amygdala and hippocampus. 
●
●
The highest level in the triune brain is the cortex: all the wrinkles 
and folds you see on the outside. Our large frontal lobes are 
what makes humans so unique. Our frontal lobes take up about 
a third of our cortex and are responsible for much of what we 
would consider thinking, decision making, planning, goal setting, 
and other executive functions. 
●
●
Among neuroscientists, the concept of the triune brain is 
seen as outdated. We really don’t have a separate reptilian or 
mammalian brain, and emotional processing and cognition are 
not distinct systems. Brains don’t have sedimentary layers that 
you can peel back. 
●
●
We know now that there is a lot of shared and distributed 
processing, and our brains are constantly being rewired as they 
respond to our life experiences. Nonetheless, the idea of a triune 
brain makes it easier to visualize the brain and think about brain 
functions. 
●
●
Within the limbic system, one key structure seems critically 
important for generating fear and anxiety and for influencing 
memory and learning: the amygdala. It contains 2 almond-
shaped masses of neurons on either side of the thalamus at the 
lower end of the hippocampus. 
●
●
When the amygdala is stimulated electrically, animals respond 
with aggression. If the amygdala is removed, animals become 
very tame and no longer respond to things that would have 
caused rage before. They also lose their adaptive fear response. 
●
●
The prefrontal cortex refers to the front of the brain, behind the 
forehead and above the eyes. The prefrontal cortex appears to 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
35
play a critical role in the regulation of emotion and behavior by 
anticipating the consequences of our actions. 
●
●
The prefrontal cortex may play an important role in delayed 
gratification by maintaining emotions over time and organizing 
behavior toward specific goals. There are 2 hemispheres of our 
brain, so we have a right and left prefrontal cortex. Increased 
activation of the right prefrontal cortex is linked to more 
negative affect (withdrawal), and right prefrontal cortex activity 
is correlated with more amygdala activity. 
●
●
The left prefrontal cortex is associated with positive emotional 
states or the tendency to approach. Increased left prefrontal cortex 
activity is increased with meditation and relaxation exercises, while 
left prefrontal cortex damage is associated with depression. 
●
●
Emotions reside in both the central nervous system and the 
peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system 
has 2 main branches: the autonomic and the somatic. We are 
most concerned with the autonomic, or automatic, system that 
responds to real or imagined stressors in our world and may help 
generate emotional experiences. 
●
●
The autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic 
nervous system (think fight or flight) and the parasympathetic 
nervous system (think rest and digest). It is the interplay of these 
2 balancing systems that gives physiologic feedback on what 
emotional states we might be experiencing. 
●
●
When afraid, your somatic nervous system is activated and 
causes a surge of adrenaline to be released. This increases 
your heart rate and blood pressure and alters blood flow. 
When we relax or do deep-breathing exercises, we activate the 
parasympathetic nervous system and experience a lowered 
heart rate, reduced muscle tension, and slower breathing.

●
●
If you recall the circumplex model of emotion, there are 2 orthogonal 
scales: one for arousal and one for valence. Our autonomic nervous 
system is responsible for the arousal component. 
●
●
We know much more about the relationship of the central 
nervous system and the peripheral nervous system with 
emotions than was ever imagined in the Cannon-Bard theory. 
We have the limbic system with the amygdala and the 
hippocampus directing attention, laying down memories, and 
generating anxiety, fear, or anger.
●
●
But we also have the closely connected prefrontal cortex, with 
bidirectional connections to the limbic system that can calm or 
intensify emotions. We have our somatic nervous system and 
autonomic nervous system to give us a sense of arousal. We have 
bottom-up and top-down explanations for emotional experiences 
and emotion regulation. What we are still missing is cognition. 
Schachter and Singer’s Theory of Emotion
●
●
In 1962, Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer proposed another 
physiologically based theory of emotion that included the 
potentially critical element of cognitive appraisal. In their view, 
the physiological arousal associated with emotion was basically 
undifferentiated. 
●
●
The individual perceives the arousal and labels it as a particular 
emotion based on a cognitive appraisal of the current situation. 
Physiology is critical to emotion, but the appraisal process is 
key—and our appraisals can be influenced by all kinds of things, 
such as our culture or context.
●
●
To test this theory, Schachter and Singer recruited young 
professionals who were required to give a public speech. Half 
were told that they would have somatic nervous system arousal 
but that this was normal and it would actually help them seem 
energetic and focused. The second group weren’t told this. Both 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
37
had somatic nervous system arousal, but the first group reported 
a more positive and successful experience. The second group 
had more negative emotion and stress. It was the appraisal of the 
physiological sensation that made the difference. 
●
●
Probably all of the theories—James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and 
Schachter and Singer—are correct to some extent. Emotions 
are about what happens in our brain (the limbic system and the 
prefrontal cortex), body, and mind (cognitive appraisals). 
●
●
Our deep dive into embodied emotions was to help us perceive 
and understand emotions, perhaps so we can better regulate 
them. But we haven’t yet proven that there is a distinguishable 
physiological signature. In fact, Schachter and Singer say that 
there isn’t. 
●
●
What kinds of signatures might we look for? We might use 
electromyograms (EMGs) to look for different patterns of muscle 
tension or changes in facial musculature. We might look at 
posture or at body temperature, heart rate, or blood pressure. 
We might even use something called galvanic skin response 
(GSR), which is a measure of the electrical conductance on your 
skin. When we’re anxious, we have tiny amounts of sweat that 
would change our GSR. 
●
●
Polygraph tests, or lie detectors, and modern biofeedback 
equipment can measure all of these physiological variables. But 
even with all of these interesting effects and measures, we don’t 
yet have a way to identify a precise physiologic signature. We 
can easily measure arousal, but it mostly stops there. 
●
●
Not every emotion scientist is sold on the idea of brain regions 
being linked to particular emotions. One of the most vocal critics 
is Lisa Feldman Barrett. Her group at Northeastern University 
collectively analyzed brain imaging studies published from 
1990 to 2011 and were unable to find a brain region that was 
dedicated to any single emotion. They also found that the typical 

Lecture 4 | Embodied Emotions
38
regions thought to regulate emotions were also involved in non-
emotional functions. The jury is still out.
●
●
Emotions exist for a reason. They either push toward action or 
pull you away from danger. They provide critical information 
necessary for decision making and can even actively alter our 
memories and how we learn.
●
●
But the link between cognition and emotion is bidirectional. 
Physiological arousal is important, but how we explain our 
emotional arousal is perhaps even more important as we try to 
understand our experience of emotion and how it affects our 
health and relationships. If you are interested in changing your 
EQ, you must pay attention to both the body and cognition. 
●
●
We have a choice. We can’t do anything about the brains we 
have in this moment nor change all the things that happened in 
the past, but from this point forward, we can use our minds to 
change our brains and emotions for the better.
Polygraph tests, or lie 
detectors, and modern 
biofeedback equipment 
can measure 
physiological variables.

Mental Operations
●
●
Contemporary emotion theories emphasize the roles emotions 
play by preparing behavioral responses, directing attention, 
enhancing 
memory, 
influencing 
decisions, 
and 
shaping 
interpersonal interactions. To fully appreciate the roles that 
emotions play, we need to consider the different, interdependent 
categories of mental operations that might be in play at any 
given time. 
●
●
We typically think of 3 types of mental operations: motivation, 
cognition, and emotion. EQ cuts across all 3 of these categories 
of mental operations. EQ is the ability to perceive and express 
emotions, use emotions to facilitate thought, understand the 
meaning of emotions, and manage and regulate emotions in 
the self and others. This has big implications for motivation and 
cognition (how we think) and is directly related to our emotional 
experiences. 
›
›
Emotions are a signal, a report that something has changed in 
our environment or in our relationships. Emotions help organize 
behavioral responses in pursuit of a goal. If your goal is safety 
and survival, then fear motivates you to flee or fight. 
›
›
Motivation can be thought of on both basic and complex 
levels. On a basic level, motivation is a response to an internal 
biological state, such as hunger or thirst. You are motivated—
driven, really—to eat or drink. As humans, though, we have much 
more complex and sometimes-contradictory goals that make 
motivation a bit trickier. You might like to lose 10 pounds, but 
you also like Southern comfort food and are more committed 
to your students and patients than you are to physical exercise. 
All are competing drives and goals to be sorted out in a highly 
subjective decision-making process. 
›
›
Cognition helps us process information, learn from the 
environment, and solve problems. 
●
●
These 3 sets of mental operations interact to predict success in 
work, relationships, and physical and mental wellness. 

Lecture 5 | Emotional Impacts
42
IQ versus EQ
●
●
David Wechsler—of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the 
most common measure of IQ—tells us as early as 1940 that it 
isn’t all about IQ or intellectual functioning. It is also about our 
ability to cope with our environments. 
●
●
A 2008 article in the Annual Review of Psychology by John D. 
Mayer, Richard Roberts, and Sigal Barsade provides a good 
summary of what research on EQ has shown thus far. EQ 
is positively correlated with work performance and better 
negotiations with others. EQ predicts good social relationships 
and is perceived as more pleasant, empathic, and socially adroit. 
People with high EQ have higher levels of subjective well-being. 
●
●
There is only a weak relationship with academic achievement 
once IQ is controlled. The strength of the relationships found, 
while significant, are not as robust as initially reported in the 
1990s. But there are many variables we have to consider when 
trying to predict something as complex as success or health. 
●
●
A classic example of a study analyzing IQ and EQ is the bridge-
Somerville Youth Study, which was a 40-year longitudinal study 
of 450 boys who grew up in Somerville, Massachusetts, done 
by George Valliant and John Snarey. Two-thirds of the boys 
were from welfare families, and one-third had IQs of below 90. 
However, IQ had little relationship to how well they did at work 
or in the rest of their lives. What made the biggest difference 
was childhood abilities, such as being able to manage frustration, 
control emotions, and get along with other people.
●
●
Another good example is Feist and Barron’s 1996 retrospective 
study of 80 Ph.D.s in science who underwent a battery of 
personality tests, IQ tests, and interviews in the 1950s when 
they were graduate students at the University of California, 
Berkeley. When they were in their early 70s, about 40 years 
later, they were tracked down and had their resumes evaluated 
by experts to determine their level of success. According to this 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
43
study, emotional abilities were 4 times more important than IQ in 
determining professional success and prestige. 
Attention
●
●
Emotion can strongly influence our cognitions and subsequent 
moods. Emotions may direct and control our attention and 
concentration, and they also influence how we might bias or 
distort our world or even how we make decisions or lay down 
new memories. 
●
●
There are just too many things in the world to pay attention 
to, particularly in this digital age, when we are almost never 
unplugged. We need—and have—a system that tells us what to 
pay attention to. 
●
●
All emotion is goal directed on some level. Sometimes those 
goals are quite complex and nuanced—to find a sense of meaning 
and interpersonal connection—or the goals can be quite basic—
to experience pleasure or to avoid pain or injury. We have our 
reward and anxiety systems for just that purpose. 
●
●
In terms of attention and focus, a little anxiety is actually a good 
thing. It might even improve performance. The Yerkes-Dodson 
curve, which is an inverted U shape, reminds us that there is an 
optimal amount of fear that enhances performance. Too little 
fear and you just don’t care. Too much and you are distracted. 
Just enough and you perform well. 
●
●
If you apply this idea to the circumplex model of emotions, with 
its 2 axes for positive and negative emotions and hi/low arousal, 
then the medium arousal regions are probably optimal for 
attention and focus. If things are too hot, you lose ability. If they 
are too cold, you just don’t have any motivation.

Lecture 5 | Emotional Impacts
44
●
●
On a most basic level, emotion impacts thinking by directing 
attention, and by doing so it will alter how we process information—
how we think.
Decision Making
●
●
The study of decision making has traditionally been dominated 
by economists who study a species called Homo economicus, 
entirely imaginary humans who only make rational decisions. 
Fortunately, we are now seeing more collaborative work between 
psychology and economics. 
●
●
Two well-known psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos 
Tversky, are considered the fathers of what has now become 
known as behavioral economics, which melds psychology and 
economics. Their work has been so influential that Kahneman 
won a Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. 
●
●
Kahneman and Tversky are best known for what is called dual-
system theory, which posits a theoretical framework to explain 
why our judgements and decisions are so often irrational. In this 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
45
dual model, there are 2 parallel processing systems: system 1 and 
system 2. 
●
●
System 1 consists of intuitive, automatic, rapid, and mostly 
unconscious thinking. These are the blink judgments, the implicit 
biases, the gut feelings (which are also cognitions). System 2 is 
reflective, controlled, deliberative, and analytical. 
●
●
Because system 1 is so quick, it doesn’t take a lot of energy. 
System 2 is slow and hogs processing energy and attention. We 
get in trouble when we over-rely on system 1 in situations where 
more deliberative thinking is needed. That’s not to say that 
system 1 is bad, because it isn’t. 
●
●
If you’re doing rote tasks, such as driving home from work, you 
really don’t need to take out a map and carefully plan out your 
route. If you see another driver driving erratically, you don’t want 
to construct hypotheses about why and create a menu of options 
you might try to avoid an accident. You rely on quick judgment 
and instinctively take evasive action. 
●
●
But think about a conflict with a loved one or meeting a new 
boss who makes an unusual request of you. Or maybe you’re in 
the health-care field and someone presents with some unusual 
symptoms but no diagnosis. You want to slow down and bring 
rationality forward. In terms of EQ, this often requires us to regulate 
our emotions so that we can get to more system-2 thinking. 
●
●
Heuristics are thinking shortcuts from system 1. In general, people 
are less likely to take risks if their options are framed as gains. It’s 
irrational, but it’s how our brains work, and it’s just one of many 
heuristics. In general, unpleasant emotions are associated with 
lower confidence and risk aversion, and positive emotions are 
associated with more confidence, more optimistic framing, and 
more positive expectancies for outcomes. 
●
●
Different emotions affect information processing in different 
ways. Research has shown that if you are slightly sad, you are 

Lecture 5 | Emotional Impacts
46
better at analyzing and editing a written document. If you are 
slightly angry, you are better at discriminating between weak 
and strong arguments. Note that there seems to be an optimal 
level of emotional arousal that helps performance. 
●
●
If an emotion becomes too strong, we’re prone to more 
distortions and more tunnel vision—something the Stoics knew 
long ago. It’s safe to say that emotions and cognitions are deeply 
intertwined, and we will always be prone to cognitive shortcuts, 
or heuristics. Figuring out what shortcuts tend to be our favorites 
and how they affect us and those around us is really the stuff of 
cognitive behavioral therapy. 
If you’re doing rote tasks, 
such as driving home 
from work, you really 
don’t need to take out a 
map and carefully plan 
out your route.

Questions to Consider
1.	 If IQ only accounts for 10% to 20% of success and EQ only 
accounts for 10%, what predicts the other 70%? It seems like a 
rather large piece of the puzzle is missing. How would you go 
about finding that piece?
2.	 In this lecture, you learned about cognitive heuristics and 
framing effects: how framing things as a loss will make people 
more comfortable to take risks. How do framing effects enter 
into medical care? Consider the example of a cardiologist or an 
oncologist who is presenting you with treatment options. Does 
he or she frame your odds as a gain (survival) or loss (death/
disability)? How would this affect your decision making?

Emotions

his lecture focuses on the perception and expression of 
emotion. It will cover all of the primary emotions and will 
include perception and expression of emotions in both the 
self and others. Although perception and expression are complex 
and rich concepts on their own, they are intimately tied together. In 
fact, it’s difficult to talk about one without invoking the other. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
49
Communicating Emotions
●
●
Although some forms of emotional expression are innate—such 
as when babies cry or smile or laugh—we learn more complex 
expressions of emotions as we grow older, often from social 
rules and customs. In part, we learn these rules from observing 
or perceiving others, hence our perceptions and our abilities to 
express become intimately connected. In fact, some emotion 
researchers have even joked that if an emotion is expressed and 
no one is around to perceive it, did it really happen?
●
●
Albert Mehrabian, an emeritus professor at the University 
of California, Los Angeles, is best known for his research in 
nonverbal communication and whether we like someone. 
His work is often called the 7%-38%-55% rule of personal 
communication, referring to 7% of meaning coming from words, 
38% from tone of voice, and 55% from nonverbal, such as posture 
and facial expressions. 
●
●
His work is often misquoted as applying to communication 
in general when he was really only interested in what types of 
communication predict whether we will like someone. In that 
case, those percentages hold true if and only if they are all 
congruent with one another. 
●
●
For example, you can’t tell someone you like him or her in a 
sarcastic tone while rolling your eyes and smirking—not if you 
want that person to like you back. Nonetheless, Mehrabian’s 
work does help us think about channels of interpersonal 
communication and the necessity to consider all of them. 
●
●
In face-to-face encounters, language, sound, facial expressions, 
and other nonverbal cues all occur simultaneously. That’s why 
it’s more difficult to misunderstand someone if you are having a 
face-to-face conversation. But life is busy, and we are often left 
dealing with limited information. 

Lecture 6 | Perceiving and Expressing Emotions
50
Facial Expressions
●
●
Paul Ekman identified a set of 6 universal emotions. He did so 
by showing photographs of facial expressions to cultures around 
the world and found that we have a core set of 6: happiness, 
anger, sadness, disgust, fear, and surprise.
●
●
What makes a happy facial expression happy? The zygomatic 
major muscles pull the corners of the mouth upward into a smile. 
But what really is the giveaway is the tightening of the muscles 
at the corners of the eyes, the obicularis oculi muscles, that gives 
you the classic crow’s-feet and causes a pouching of the lower 
eyelids. If you see both—the smile and the crinkled eyes—you 
have accurately perceived happiness.

●
●
If you are interested in a similar breakdown for all 6 universal 
emotions, check out the Greater Good website. Among many 
other things, it hosts a free facial-recognition test with detailed 
explanations. You can find it at http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/
ei_quiz/.
●
●
Facial expressions are quite rich and complex, but they are only 
one type of nonverbal emotional communication. Other forms 
include body posture, eye contact, and body movement (such as 
gesticulating). 
Auditory Information
●
●
There’s also nonlinguistic auditory information, such as tone of 
voice or pitch. To demonstrate the power of nonverbal cues, try 
a blank-wall exercise. For this exercise, you need a partner. One 
of you will talk for 2 minutes about something you did recently. 
The other will be a blank wall—with no reaction or nodding, but 
eye contact is okay. What do you think happens?
●
●
There’s also an important category of auditory but nonlinguistic 
information: tone of voice, pitch, and rate of speech. These 
elements can often enrich what we derive from language and 
can help us clear up ambiguous information. 
●
●
Prosody, or the musicality of language, is quite complex. Some 
of its emotional effects are universal—sobbing words sound sad 
regardless of the language—but some of the effects are learned. 
We become familiar with how to use volume, rate, and pacing to 
express the emotion we wish to convey. We need an accurate 
communication sender as well as a perceiver. 
Perception
●
●
It is difficult to pull apart emotion expression and emotion 
perceptions. One sort of blurs into the other. Perception is heavily 

Lecture 6 | Perceiving and Expressing Emotions
52
influenced by expression but is often distorted, filtered, or even 
entirely changed. 
●
●
Sounds that express emotion, such as laughter, crying, and 
language, are only valuable if they can be accurately perceived. 
So, how does our emotional perceptual apparatus work? 
●
●
If you are like most people, music evokes some emotion—
probably not to an intense degree unless you have a personal 
association with the particular music being played, but some 
emotion nonetheless. 
●
●
Composers have an intent to express a feeling through sound, 
and we receive their message—one that is beautiful and relaxing, 
perhaps, or powerful, bombastic, and loud. Music—or a ballet, 
movie, or work of art—moves us to another place due to the artists’ 
ability to express emotion and our ability to perceive emotion. 
●
●
But not all people have the exact same reaction to the same music. 
Your perception is altered by who you are, what you are doing, or 
other contextual factors. 
●
●
We know that we actively and subjectively construct our 
realities, including distorting our senses. For example, if you are 
depressed, your house will look dirtier than if you are happy. If 
you are carrying a backpack while hiking, landmarks look farther 
away. If you have just worked out, that hill in front of you looks 
much steeper than usual. This is just the way our predictably 
irrational mind works. 
●
●
The same holds true for our perceptions of emotions. Our 
perceptions are certainly influenced by who we are. From an 
EQ perspective, we want to become more conscious of how we 
might be altering our perceptual reality. Do you see rejection in 
every social encounter? Do we see danger around every corner? 
Do we see a winning number each time we buy a lottery ticket? 
The goal isn’t to be perfectly rational all the time. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
53
●
●
The goal is really up to you. When thinking about emotional 
adjustments to reach your goals, think of the analogy of adjusting 
the color knobs on a television. You might decide that there are 
too many red or brown or blue shades, so you tweak the settings 
to bring better clarity. How can you go about adjusting those 
knobs when it comes to emotions? 
●
●
A DVD program developed by Paul Ekman gives us one 
interesting and evidence-based example. The program is called 
the Micro Expressions Training Tool, and it is designed to help 
people pick up on very subtle emotional cues. You start by sitting 
in front of a computer screen, watching a face. An expression 
quickly appears on the face and then disappears. You have to 
rate what you just saw and interpret what it meant. 
●
●
The program systematically teaches you what to look for and 
what micro-expressions may mean. Initial research findings have 
shown that the program works, but data on clinical significance 
are limited.
Music moves us to 
another place due to the 
artists’ ability to express 
emotion and our ability 
to perceive emotion.

Lecture 6 | Perceiving and Expressing Emotions
54
●
●
If you are interested in a more general measure of your abilities 
to perceive and understand nonverbal emotional cues, the 
DANVA2, developed by Stephen Nowicki at Emory University, 
is the most commonly used. It is a computer test that presents 
faces, postures, and audio clips and then asks you about what 
you perceive. The DANVA has been linked to a number of social 
and business outcomes and seems to rest squarely within most 
of the EQ frameworks that have been addressed in this course. 
Self-Perception
●
●
You’ve learned about emotional expression and perception, 
but mostly within an interpersonal context. What emotion 
are you expressing to someone else? What emotion are you 
perceiving from someone else? This branch of EQ also includes 
self-perception. How good are you at detecting your own 
emotional states? 
●
●
If you are interested in your own level of emotional awareness, 
you can try the lack of emotional awareness subscale that is part 
of the larger Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The 
subscale focuses on self-perceived emotional awareness, with 
higher scores indicating greater problems with awareness. Both 
the subscale and full DERS scale are available online.
●
●
Our culture very much influences how we express and perceive 
emotion. According to Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen, cultures 
give us something called display rules, the cultural norms that 
dictate the management and modification of emotional displays 
depending on social circumstances. 
●
●
A classic example is the emotional rule book given to men and 
women in our society. Men aren’t supposed to be vulnerable. 
Only certain emotions are okay to express, and that will depend 
on context. Consider sporting events, such as the Super Bowl 
and the World Cup. When else are men allowed to hug and cry? 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
55
●
●
It’s about cultural display rules. When you can’t display an emotion 
you are feeling, you have to suppress it, and that comes with a 
cost. In European American samples, suppression is associated 
with increases in physiological arousal and with negative effects 
on memory and social relationships. Long-term suppression is 
associated with depressive symptoms and low life satisfaction.

57
Why We Have Emotions
●
●
Emotions serve as a sort of compass that tells us where to go. If 
you feel sad, the emotion is telling you that you need to make a 
left turn. If you’re happy, it tells you to keep going straight ahead. 
Our emotions are fleeting because a compass that stays stuck on 
due north would be useless. 
●
●
Our emotions are always giving us updates. We do self-monitoring 
exercises to gather data on ourselves but also to train ourselves 
to be more aware of shifts in our emotional states when they 
occur. A shift doesn’t necessarily require any response, but the 
awareness gives you a choice of what to do next. 
●
●
Each of the emotions that Paul Ekman calls the primary 
emotions—happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear—
is found across cultures, across languages, and across all levels of 
income and education. All except surprise are represented in the 
Atlas of Emotions, found at atlasofemotions.org.
●
●
This atlas, created by Paul Ekman and his daughter Eve, is a 
visual tool to build your emotion vocabulary. The goal is to 
increase choice in what we 
become 
emotional 
about 
and how we respond. The 
atlas was commissioned by 
the Dalai Lama to create 
a scientifically based road 
map 
to 
emotional 
self-
awareness. 
●
●
Each universal emotion is 
explored with regard to 
specific emotional states, 
action, 
triggers, 
and 
moods—the 
longer-lasting 
cousins to emotions. 
Exercise: Emotional Mapping
Log into the Atlas of Emotions, 
pull out your notes from this 
course, and watch a movie—really 
any movie. Pick a scene and begin 
to emotionally map it. It will help 
you become more familiar with 
the language and with emotional 
perception and understanding. It 
is even more helpful if you watch 
the scene with a friend and have 
him or her independently do the 
same exercise and then compare 
and discuss notes later.

●
Fear is adaptive. It helps us anticipate threats to our safety and 
mobilize resources to keep ourselves safe. Fear states, ranging 
from least to most intense, include trepidation, nervousness, 
dread, panic, and horror. Fear actions include avoiding, 
freezing, screaming, worrying, and withdrawing. Fear triggers 
include snakelike shapes, thunder, growling, loss of a job, and 
public speaking. Fear moods include being apprehensive and 
hypervigilant.
●
●
For anger, the states, again ranging from least to most intense, 
include annoyance, frustration, argumentativeness, bitterness, 
vengeful, and fury. Anger actions include disputing, being 
passive aggressive, insulting, quarreling, brooding, yelling, 
and hitting. Anger triggers include interference, rejection, 
bureaucracy, wrongful accusation, and being insulted. Anger 
moods include feeling irritable.
●
●
For sadness, the states, once again ranging from least to most 
intense, include disappointment, discouragement, resignation, 
hopelessness, despair, grief, sorrow, and anguish. Sadness 
actions include mourning, withdrawing, protesting, seeking 
comfort, and ruminating. Sadness triggers include rejection, 
loss of status, and loss of an object or a person. Sadness moods 
include dysphoria and feeling blue.
●
●
The atlas gives us a nice map, but it doesn’t tell us much about 
emotion dynamics. The cognitive behavioral therapy triangle 
helps us better understand the interrelationships between 
emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. If we want to understand 
emotions—and eventually change them—we need to understand 
the thoughts and behaviors behind them. Each emotion, positive 
or negative, has a function. 
●
●
The cognitive themes for some of these emotions are as follows: 
›
›
Anger often includes thoughts about a perceived violation, 
injustice, or frustration of a wish or desire.

›
›
Happiness usually involves the perception or expectation of a 
gain.
›
›
Anxiety or fear involves the perception of a threat or danger or 
difficulty with coping.
›
›
Sadness includes the perception that something of value has 
been or will be lost.
●
●
Knowing these themes or meanings may help us use emotional 
information, but there are a number of steps we need to take.
›
›
We need to be able to perceive and correctly identify the 
emotion. This might include physical, cognitive, or behavioral 
cues.
›
›
We need to know the trigger for that emotion. Was it internal 
or external? Was it real or imagined? Was it in the present or 
in memory?
›
›
Once you’ve identified the emotion and its trigger, you’ve 
reached the interpretive step, and understanding the themes 
associated with emotions might help you understand just 
what’s going on. 
Anger often includes 
thoughts about a 
perceived violation, 
injustice, or frustration 
of a wish or desire.

●
●
Emotions are complex and vary greatly across people, so it 
behooves each of us to develop a deep understanding of our 
emotional instrument. Are you easily angered? Are you typically 
anxious? Do you savor positive emotions? Do you ruminate 
about bad ones?
●
●
Anxiety and fear are adaptive, functional features within the 
human emotional repertoire that only sometimes misfire 
and cause impairment. Fear and anxiety are psychological 
and physiological responses to danger. Anxiety is a diffuse, 
unpleasant, vague sense of apprehension. It is influenced by 
culture, cognition, personality, and a number of other internal 
factors. Anxiety can trigger fear, and fear can result in lingering 
anxiety. When they are excessive—when they do misfire—they 
can cause a great deal of pain and suffering. 
●
●
In Ekman’s atlas, there are 5 emotions: 4 negative, 1 positive 
(enjoyment). There’s been a bit of debate about whether surprise 
belongs, and most recently it has been folded into fear because 
the facial expressions can be so similar. This 4-to-1 ratio of 
negative to positive might in part explain why so much research 
and so many resources are devoted to the negative emotions. 
Ekman's Atlas

●
●
But we do have happiness, or enjoyment. Enjoyment states 
include sensory pleasure, amusement, relief, wonder, excitement, 
and ecstasy. Enjoyment actions include exclaiming, engaging, 
indulging, and savoring. Enjoyment triggers include interactions 
with others, good food, playing a game, and sensory experiences. 
Enjoyment moods include being elated. There are some interesting 
blends within this category, such as schadenfreude, which is the 
enjoyment of the misfortunes of another person, usually a rival. 
Insights from Positive Psychology
●
●
Fortunately, researchers are now turning their attention to the 
full range of positive emotions. The field of positive psychology 
includes the study of such phenomena as creativity, enthusiasm, 
wisdom, and insight. Positive psychology looks at how we create 
states such as enjoyment, well-being, or life satisfaction. 
●
●
Some initial findings for happiness include that 1/3 of Americans 
describe themselves as happy. Happiness is not predicted by 
income, age, or gender. Happiness correlates with extroversion 
and spirituality. Relationships and friendships are key. In general, 
people are happiest in their 20s and in their 60s.
●
●
Income and happiness are related up to a point, because we 
need food, shelter, and clothing, but it simply doesn’t matter 
after that. In fact, in the United States, the amount we need is 
set at between $50,000 and $70,000, depending on where a 
particular family happens to live. 
●
●
Why does the money matter more? It comes down to 2 different 
processes. One is called hedonic adaptation, which means that 
we simply get used to what we have and stop deriving pleasure 
from it. The second phenomenon is upward social comparison: 
No matter how well you’re doing, there’s always someone who 
has a slightly bigger house, so it’s difficult for money to have a 
lasting impact on happiness.

Lecture 7 | Understanding Emotions
62
Emotion Regulation Therapy
●
●
A new type of psychotherapy called emotion regulation therapy, 
developed by Douglas Mennin and David Fresco, rests in 
affective science, or more specifically, normative and disordered 
emotional processing and learning. It looks at 3 important areas: 
motivational mechanisms, emotion regulatory mechanisms, and 
contextual learning consequences. 
●
●
For motivation, we want to maximize reward while minimizing 
losses, seeking safety, and avoiding threats. We have built-in 
reward and security systems that help us do that. 
●
●
For regulation, we have multiple pathways to help us. We have 
hardwired pathways that take us from the limbic system to 
the prefrontal cortex, and we also have the top-down system, 
which runs from the prefrontal cortex down to the limbic system. 
Individuals with distress disorders have a more difficult time 
regulating their emotion.
●
●
For contextual learning—which can also be thought of as 
adaptation as we move through life—we need to be aware of 
cues and contingencies so that we can adapt and learn from our 
environment. This could mean the difference between life and 
death or love and loss. We need to learn important queues for 
safety and for threats. 
●
●
For distress disorders, depressive people are less responsive to 
future opportunities for rewards. They’re bad at predicting the 
size or intensity of reward. Their rumination narrows associative 
processing and impairs their learning. 
●
●
For people with anxiety, they’re worse at stimulus discrimination 
and generalize more broadly. They’re hypervigilant and tend to 
be overreactive in their emotional responses.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Thinking about the cognitive theme behind each universal 
emotion is a good starting point, but as we know, emotions 
are much more complex and nuanced. What would be the 
purpose of emotions such as nostalgia, schadenfreude, and 
giddiness? Would each of these fall into an emotional family, 
and does that help us understand it?
2.	 As both Maria and Carol demonstrate, our relationships with 
our emotions evolve over time. We accept losses. We face our 
fears. What is the driving force behind that evolution? What is 
it that makes some of us get so stuck sometimes?

Lecture 8
Managing Your Emotions
T
his lecture is on the management of emotions in the self. 
This is the first of 2 lectures on emotion management, or 
regulation. The lecture will start with a quick review of the 
primary model of EQ and the modal model of emotion. From there, 
the lecture will focus on emotion regulation and specifically on 
how we regulate emotions in ourselves. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
65
Emotion Regulation
●
●
The primary model of EQ we’ve been using is the Salovey, Mayer, 
and Caruso integrative ability model, also called the 4-branch 
model. The original 4 branches are the ability to perceive 
emotion (self and others), use emotion (harness for cognitive 
tasks), understand and reason with emotion, and regulate 
emotion in the self and others. The psychometric data for the 
second branch, the use of emotions, is weaker and often gets 
folded into understanding and regulation. 
●
●
In the modal model of emotions, we move from situation, to 
attention, to appraisal, and end with the emotion response. The 
response may then feed back to alter the situation. It is at some 
point along this pathway that we need to insert an emotion 
regulation strategy. 
●
●
According to James Gross, emotion regulation is conceptualized 
as the process of “shaping which emotions one has, when one has 
them, and how one experiences or expresses these emotions.” 
Emotion regulation can be automatic or effortful. 
●
●
Automatic emotion regulation can be thought of as a sort of 
innate psychological immune system. An unwanted intruder—a 
negative emotion—has entered the picture and needs to be 
neutralized before the infection can spread. Emotion regulation 
can be directed at the self or at others.
●
●
Emotion regulation is usually prohedonic, meaning to optimize 
well-being, but it can sometimes be contrahedonic, where we 
dwell on or intensify negative emotions. Think about the times 
you might have knowingly watched a sad movie, ridden a roller 
coaster, or wallowed a bit in your old diaries. 
●
●
Regulation can occur on a number of levels, including 
neurotransmitters (perhaps you take an antidepressant) and 
using meditation to strengthen your prefrontal cortex. Regulation 
can also occur on cognitive, behavioral, or social levels. 

Lecture 8 | Managing Your Emotions
66
●
●
Emotion regulation has 3 core features: the activation of a 
regulatory goal, the engagement of regulatory processes, and 
the modulation of the emotion trajectory. 
›
›
The activation of a regulatory goal involves who or what the 
target of the regulation is. Is it internal, or intrinsic, or is it 
external? Is my goal to regulate myself or to regulate you? 
›
›
The engagement of a regulatory strategy includes the full range 
of interventions we might try to accomplish our goal. These 
interventions might be explicit and conscious—you try to keep 
a poker face—or they might be automatic and unconscious—
your mind immediately zones out when something potentially 
upsetting gets brought up. 
›
›
The modulation of the emotion trajectory refers to the impact 
of your selected strategy on emotion dynamics, or the latency, 
rise time, magnitude, and duration of the emotional response. 
●
●
So, emotion regulation has 3 key features: the target of the 
goal (self or others), the selected strategy, and the effect of the 
strategy. When thinking about EQ, and particularly the fourth 
branch, the regulation of emotion, you’ll want to think about 
each of these. 
●
●
Next, we want to be able to place our emotion regulatory strategies 
on the continuum provided by the modal model of emotions, in 
which the path is situation followed by attention, cognition, and 
response. We can flesh out the model just a bit more so that we 
can place nearly all emotion regulatory strategies on it. 
›
›
Situation becomes situation selection. A very basic way to 
manage an emotion is not to put yourself in a situation where it 
might get evoked. 
›
›
Next is situation modification. You might not be able to avoid 
the situation, but you can change it so that it changes your 
mood. If you go to a party, bring a good friend. 
››
About midway on the continuum is attentional deployment. We 
have to pay attention to something to be emotionally activated. 
One common mood-management strategy is distraction. We 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
67
only have so much processing bandwidth, so if you distract 
yourself with something absorbing, it can be quite effective. 
›
›
Next is cognitive change, and this is where reappraisals and 
cognitive behavioral skills really reign supreme. Change the way 
you think about it and you’ll change the way you feel. Ruminate 
about it and you’ll extend the duration of the emotion. 
›
›
Last is the category of response modulation, where the 
emotion has already occurred and you are trying to either 
ramp it up or ramp it down. A common example is emotional 
suppression, in which you simply try to shove the feelings back 
down or put them on a shelf. 
●
●
You can divide these different stops on the continuum into 
2 broad categories: antecedent focused (they occur before 
the emotion) or response focused where they occur after the 
emotion. In general, antecedent focused strategies are seen 
as more effective because they occur earlier and have a better 
chance of preventing the harmful effects of negative emotions. 
Emotion Regulation Strategies
●
●
The first category of emotion regulation in the self is situation 
selection. This is defined by James Gross as “approaching or 
avoiding certain people, places, or objects in order to regulate 
emotions.” A person with social anxiety might use situation 
selection as an emotion regulation strategy.
●
●
The next category of emotional regulation in the self is attentional 
deployment, or the channeling of attention in ways that are 
conducive to the desired emotional outcome. This is both an 
innate and a learned behavior. We automatically orient to loud 
noises or smile when we hear laughter. Our culture teaches us 
more nuanced rules. 
●
●
Parents use strategies to manage the attentional deployment 
of children. If your 5-year-old child is angry, what do you do? It 
depends on the context, but you might do something to distract 

Lecture 8 | Managing Your Emotions
68
him or her, such as ask a question, point to a cute dog, or read 
a story. The strategies of different cultures match their cultural 
values. 
●
●
For both children and adults, distraction is a common attentional 
deployment strategy. We can only process about 110 bytes of 
information per second. It takes 60 bytes to listen to one person 
talking. If you are trying to stop ruminative thoughts, a phone call 
to a friend takes up much more bandwidth than soothing music 
in the background. 
●
●
Start with the low-bandwidth distractors—such as pleasant 
music or a bubble bath—and if those don’t work, increase the 
bandwidth demands. Pick something that engages all of your 
senses and challenges you to keep up. 
●
●
The “don’t worry; be happy” strategy isn’t particularly effective. 
A more effective strategy that is in the attentional deployment 
Parents use strategies to 
manage the attentional 
deployment of children.

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
69
category is to intentionally notice and list positive things around 
you or positive things that happened that day. It takes up 
bandwidth and also shifts perspective. 
●
●
A very rich and complex set of emotion regulation strategies for 
the self is cognitive modification. For cognitive modification, we 
will focus on the thoughts component of the cognitive behavioral 
therapy triangle (emotions and behaviors are the other 2 
components). First, you have to be aware of your thoughts; the 
second step is to have the skills to modify them. 
●
●
Humans are predictably irrational, and we often have common 
habits of mind that cause our emotions to shift in unwanted or 
unhelpful ways. 
●
●
ABCD is an important cognitive-modification strategy that 
is a core skill in cognitive behavioral therapy. The A stands for 
activating event, which triggers B, the beliefs or cognitions, 
which triggers C, the consequences, which are your emotions 
and behaviors. Eventually, if you decide that those consequences 
are unwanted—they don’t fit your goals—you would change your 
beliefs, or do a disputation, which is what D stands for. To do the 
exercise, divide a piece of paper into 4 quadrants, with each of 
the letters written in each of the quadrants. 
●
●
ABCD is an emotion regulation strategy that can help us make 
reappraisals about potentially stressful situations. That threat can 
be turned into an opportunity. That feared worst-case scenario 
can be replaced with something that’s more likely to happen. 
●
●
Reappraisal happens early in the modal model emotional process, 
so it prevents emotions from occurring or downregulates early. 
This means less emotional experiencing and less potential damage. 

Lecture 8 | Managing Your Emotions
70
●
●
A common cognitive-processing strategy that many people use 
is keeping a diary or journal. But there’s a way to do it that might 
maximize the benefit. Before the work of James Pennebaker, 
there was a raging debate about whether journaling was even a 
good idea. Was it positive processing or just rumination? It looks 
like it can probably be quite helpful, but we don’t quite yet know 
all the ins and outs. 
●
●
In the typical Pennebaker experimental paradigm, he recruits 
a group of subjects and has half of them write an emotionally 
charged entry and half write about something boring or 
mundane. He then repeats this for a series of days and tracks 
mood, physical health, and so on. 
●
●
What does the research show in terms of the effectiveness or 
helpfulness of journaling? Pennebaker found that high-emotion 
journaling led to improved and increased lung function in asthma 
patients, less pain and swelling in the joints of patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, and statistically significant increases in CD4 
counts in HIV-positive patients (although no clinical differences). 
Journaling neither helped nor hurt bereaved subjects.
●
●
The next category of emotion regulation strategies to explore is 
response modulation. This happens after the emotion has been 
generated. A common example is suppression, which carries 
important negative consequences. Other examples include 
somatic-quieting interventions, such as deep breathing or 
meditation—something to activate the parasympathetic nervous 
system and decrease arousal. 
●
●
A type of therapy called dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was 
specifically created to help people with emotion dysregulation 
disorders. You can think of DBT as cognitive behavioral therapy 
mixed with Buddhist meditation and mindfulness. DBT has 4 
main modules: mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion 
regulation, and distress tolerance.

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
71
●
●
One example of a DBT emotion-response modulation strategy 
is opposite action, which requires you to do the opposite of 
what an emotion is urging you to do. Although many think it is 
cathartic to act out, giving in to action urges makes the feeling 
more intense. 
●
●
Do the opposite of whatever your emotions are urging you to do. 
If you feel shyness, you lift your chin, make eye contact, stand 
tall, and speak loudly. If you feel anger, release muscle tension, 
round your shoulders, look downward, and slow your breathing. 
●
●
It takes practice and feels strange, but good evidence shows that 
it can help. Marsha Linehan, the founder of DBT and a patient 
herself, says that facial expression and body postures could 
influence our emotional experiences. 
Measuring Effectiveness
●
●
At this point, you may be wondering how we go about studying 
the effectiveness of different emotion regulation strategies. 
We need to know what works so that we can know what to 
recommend or teach. There are self-report questionnaires, but 
there are also lab-based approaches. 
Somatic-quieting 
interventions, such as 
deep breathing, activate 
the parasympathetic 
nervous system and 
decrease arousal.

Lecture 8 | Managing Your Emotions
72
●
●
A commonly used self-report measure is the Difficulties in 
Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). It was developed by Kim 
Gratz and Lizabeth Roemer in 2004 and includes 36 statements 
that you rate on a 1- to 5-point scale (“almost never” to “always”). 
It is to be used in people who have distress disorder or other 
psychopathology so that we can better understand the role 
of emotion regulation. It gives you 6 subscales, including lack 
of emotional awareness, lack of emotional clarity, and impulse 
control difficulties. The DERS correlates with depression, anxiety, 
suicidality, eating disorders, and alcohol and drug use.
●
●
Another self-report measure is called the Emotion Regulation 
Questionnaire (ERQ), which has been used quite often in research 
and has been translated into 15 languages. It was developed by 
James Gross and Oliver John in 2003 and has 10 items looking 
at both positive and negative emotions, but it only includes 
cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression as regulation 
strategies.

Questions to Consider
1.	 What are your go-to emotion regulation strategies, and where 
do they fall on the modal model of emotion continuum? How 
effective are they? 
2.	 Are there any disadvantages to being good at emotion 
regulation? Can you be overregulated, and what are the 
consequences? What can you do about it?

Lecture 9
Managing Others’ Emotions
T
his is the second lecture on emotion regulation. This 
lecture will focus on emotion regulation in others. The 3 
core elements of EQ are the perception and expression of 
emotion, the understanding of emotion, and the management in 
the self and others. In this lecture, you will build on some of the 
self-management strategies described in the last lecture and apply 
them to the management of emotions in others. 

Lecture 9 | Managing Others’ Emotions
74
Management of Emotions in Others
●
●
When addressing the management of emotions in others, it 
includes the full range of emotions, and it might include moving 
arousal up or down, shifting valence from positive to negative, or 
altering the duration of the emotional response. And although the 
term “management” might sound somewhat cold and calculating, 
it can and often does include warmth, empathy, and kindness. 
●
●
Most Western, industrialized societies value individualism. You pick 
yourself up by your bootstraps. A pioneer is supposed to be strong 
and not burden others. In more collective cultures, such as Japan 
or China, all people are seen as interdependent. Your problem—or 
your mood—affect other people and is a shared responsibility. 
●
●
When we talk about managing moods in others, it isn’t to say 
that you are responsible for others (although you certainly are 
responsible for your children), it is really just to acknowledge that 
we live in a social world and often have to interact with others 
both at work and at home. We need a skill set to help us deal 
with the emotions that inevitably come up. You can still be an 
individualist or a collectivist, but you’ll need a skill set nonetheless. 
●
●
We should also consider contextual learning. One of the 
important features of emotions is that they help us learn from 
a situation. If you are constantly stepping in to soothe other 
people’s emotions, you may be limiting their opportunities to 
learn or reinforcing their insecurities. For example, if you always 
come to the rescue of anxious people, you may teach them that 
they are vulnerable and weak on their own. 
●
●
According to James Gross, emotion regulation is conceptualized 
as the process of “shaping which emotions one has, when one has 
them, and how one experiences or expresses these emotions.” 
This is also true for emotions in others. 
●
●
Emotion regulation has 3 key features: the target of the goal (self 
or others), the selected strategy, and the effect of the strategy. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
75
When thinking about EQ—and particularly the fourth branch, the 
regulation of emotion—you’ll want to think about each of these.
●
●
We are using the modal model of emotions to help us categorize 
our emotion regulation strategies, starting with situations and 
moving to attention, then cognition, and finally emotion responses. 
●
●
Strategies in the category of situation selection when managing 
emotions in others might include scheduling time to talk, 
scheduling pleasant activities, or scheduling time to work on a 
project together. With children, we manage their situations—
where they go and what they do—all the time. If needed, we can 
also do this to some extent with friends and family. For example, 
you know who you can and cannot invite to the same dinner 
party; you’re managing the situation before an emotion occurs. 
●
●
Situation modification is similar to when we manage our own 
emotions. We might help others by making sure we only give 
them feedback in private or put down our cell phones when we 
see they are stressed and need us to listen. We change situational 
circumstances 
to 
send 
an 
important, 
emotion-regulating 
nonverbal signal. 
●
●
What about attentional deployment? If you know that your sister 
has had a bad event happen and is prone to rumination, you can 
serve as a high-bandwidth distraction: Take her out, call her, and 

Lecture 9 | Managing Others’ Emotions
76
absorb her attention to take her mind elsewhere. Suggest activities 
that might not only distract her but will improve her mood. 
●
●
Cognitive strategies are usually directed inward, as you are really 
the only one with access to your own cognitions and appraisals. 
However, you can use those same cognitive behavioral skills to 
first manage your emotions so that you are in a better place to 
manage someone else who might be in a lot of distress. Once you 
have your equanimity, you are better able to help someone else. 
●
●
You can also use your cognitive skills to guide conversation—after 
you ask what would be most helpful. Sometimes people want 
input and guidance, but other times they just need someone to 
listen. 
●
●
Often, you can implicitly serve as a piece of counter-evidence. If 
your husband feels rejected and unloved, you prove otherwise 
when you accept him and love him. If your mother feels unheard 
and disrespected, you validate her when you listen and give her 
respect. It may be subtle and the person may not notice right 
away, but we all have the power to change hearts and minds 
simply by how we behave toward others. 
Universal Emotions and Strategies
●
●
Let’s look at some of the specific universal emotions and 
strategies that we can use to better manage them in others. First, 
there are a few tips on how to get accurate information. It helps if 
you know what another person is feeling, why he or she is feeling 
it, and how intense those feelings are. It also helps if you know 
where you stand. Are you just a bystander or an ally, or are you 
seen as one of the bad guys? Your assigned identity may change 
the effectiveness of the strategy you choose. 
●
●
You look for all of the communication factors that were covered 
in lecture 6: language, tone of voice, posture, facial expressions, 
and any other nonverbal cues. You want to use what you learned 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
77
in lecture 7, in which you learned about the cognitive theme of 
each universal emotion. This theme gives you a general idea of 
what the individual needs. Does he or she need to feel safe or 
need to feel respected? Does he or she need to mourn a loss? 
●
●
The family of sadness is triggered by the perception of real or 
symbolic loss. It ranges from mildly disappointed to grief to 
intense anguish. When looking at someone who is sad, you will 
see contraction of the procerus and corrugator muscles. You 
might see tears, a slumped posture, and psychomotor retardation 
(moving and talking slowly). There’s often poor eye contact, and 
voice volume is low with poor tone. 
●
●
Key strategies to use with people who are sad include listening 
and empathy, but there are also subtle behaviors that can help, 
such as using a slightly higher volume than the sad speaker 
but not allowing your emotions to be too positive. You may be 
dismissed if you are too chirpy or out of touch. 
A hand on a shoulder 
is a strong nonverbal 
signal of connection 
and support.

Lecture 9 | Managing Others’ Emotions
78
●
●
Establish and confirm your relationship with the sad person. Let 
the person know that you are there for him or her. Solicit his or 
her advice on what he or she needs. The sad people are the ones 
that have suffered the loss, and sometimes just having someone 
offer help is enough. 
●
●
If appropriate, use touch or physical affection. A hand on a 
shoulder is a strong nonverbal signal of connection and support. 
It clearly communicates to the other person that he or she is not 
alone. Move in closer, keep eye contact, be patient, and allow 
the other person time to be slow and sad. If a request is made, 
repeat it back to highlight that it has been heard. 
●
●
Anger is about a perceived violation or injustice—something that 
was rightly someone’s has been taken away. Anger gives the 
angry person strength but can also drive others away. 
●
●
With anger, on the top of the list is managing your own emotions. 
It is instinctive to become defensive, anxious, or even angry in 
return. With anger, there is often a lot of collateral damage; you 
may receive angry barbs even if you weren’t the cause of the 
injustice. It’s not about you—you just happen to be there and got 
leaked on. The best way to manage anger is to go in with a cool 
head. 
●
●
How do you do that? You want to be proficient in somatic 
quieting, and you want to have a beefed-up prefrontal cortex 
that can silence your amygdala as it pushes you to get angry in 
return. Ideally, you will have put in some time to build your self-
regulation skills so that you are less reactive. 
●
●
In a study of Buddhist monks by Richard Davidson at the 
University of Wisconsin, these master meditators were told that 
they would hear a loud sound and should try to suppress their 
response. They were much less reactive and reaction time was 
shorter when compared with non-meditators. They had trained 
their brains, their prefrontal cortexes, to better control emotional 
responses, a skill especially important with anger. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
79
●
●
Because the theme of the feeling of anger is a violation of rights, 
it behooves you to express empathy, let the angry person know 
that he or she has been heard, and tell him or her that you respect 
their rights. Make sure that your body language isn’t passive but 
also isn’t dominant. Give the angry person plenty of personal 
space, keep your voice volume low and the rate slow, and give 
the person plenty of time to talk. 
●
●
Apologize for what has happened; don’t necessarily take 
responsibility but express sympathy for whatever transpired. 
Be sure that your behaviors and language are soothing and 
de-escalating. Don’t ask probing questions if you see that they 
escalate the experience of anger. Make sure that you emphasize 
that you share similar goals and are on the same side. 
●
●
Fear ranges from mild nervousness to outright terror and panic, 
so the strategies you choose depend on the intensity. Your initial 
strategy will be to assess the severity of the fear, understand the 
perceived threat, and know where you fall in the process. Are 
you a friend, foe, or somewhere in between? 
●
●
You again want to use voice volume and tone as a way to decrease 
arousal. You should maintain an open posture; keep your hands 
open and visible. Try offering reassurances, resources, and ways 
to neutralize or diminish the threat. To reduce stigma, share a 
fear you’ve had and role-model how you overcame it. Remind 
the person of a past brave thing he or she did to bolster his or 
her self-confidence. 
●
●
If appropriate, help the fearful person with some problem solving 
or maybe even some behavioral rehearsal or practice. Remember 
that ultimately, anxious people need to stop using avoidance and 
need to better develop their distress-tolerance skills. 
●
●
Although we’ve mostly focused on negative emotions, we should 
also consider the regulation of positive emotions in others. This 
refers not to reducing positive emotions but to supporting and 
enriching them, perhaps even escalating them. 

Lecture 9 | Managing Others’ Emotions

●
●
A common strategy is to promote savoring. Think of savoring as a 
positive form of rumination. Ask for details about what made the 
person happy—a lot of details—share his or her enthusiasm, and 
show your admiration. File the event away so that if you need to 
regulate a negative emotion in the person later, you can remind 
him or her of this event as a form of attentional deployment. 
Some people are just naturally good at this while others might 
need a bit of practice. Whatever you might fall into, you are 
already doing a lot of emotion regulation directed to others.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Why should we even consider managing someone else’s 
emotions? Aren’t their emotions their responsibility? What’s 
the difference between managing and manipulating?
2.	 What professions would require you to be excellent at 
managing emotions in others? Are these people just naturals, 
or do they learn on the job? What lessons can we learn from 
them?

Lecture 10
The Development of EQ
I
n this lecture, you will explore the development of EQ, mostly by 
analyzing children. It seems that there is a heritable component, 
as with IQ. Personality and temperament play a role and most 
likely are not changeable over time. However, half or more of the 
variance of EQ does not come from biology. Socially, our childhoods 
are critical windows for EQ development. Fortunately, there is hope 
even if that critical window wasn’t so ideal.

Lecture 10 | The Development of EQ
82
Adverse Childhood Experiences
●
●
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is the term given to 
describe all types of abuse, neglect, and other traumatic 
experiences that occur to individuals under the age of 18. The 
landmark CDC-Kaiser ACE Study examined the relationships 
between these experiences during childhood and reduced health 
and well-being later in life. 
●
●
Between 1995 and 1997, more than 17,000 people receiving 
physical exams completed confidential surveys containing 
information about their childhood experiences and current health 
status and behaviors. Almost 2/3 of adults surveyed reported 
at least one adverse childhood experience, and the majority of 
respondents who reported at least one ACE reported more than 
one. And 12.5% of the sample reported 4 or more ACEs. 
●
●
The ACE study looked at 3 categories of adverse experience: 
childhood abuse, which included emotional, physical, and 
sexual abuse; neglect, including both physical and emotional 
neglect; and household challenges, which included growing up 
in a household where there was substance abuse, mental illness, 
violent treatment of a mother or stepmother, parental separation/
divorce, or imprisonment of a member of the household. 
●
●
Respondents were given an ACE score between 0 and 10 based on 
how many of these 10 types of adverse experiences they reported 
being exposed to. The results were stunning. Once someone 
reported 4 or more ACEs, there were strong relationships with 
a long list of health problems as well as notable decrements 
in 
academic 
achievement, 
work 
performance, 
relationship 
satisfaction, divorce, violence, and a host of other social problems. 
●
●
This is more than just EQ, but it could be argued that one of the 
most insidious and long-lasting effects on these children was 
through impaired brain development, including the development 
of the limbic system, stress response systems, and executive 
functioning of the frontal lobes. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
83
●
●
Once wired to be hypersensitive, the stress response system 
doesn’t really change. We can learn to compensate for it, but at 
least now, we really can’t change it. 
●
●
As we consider EQ development, we use the biopsychosocial 
model, which reminds us to look at variables in the biological, 
psychological, and social domains and that these domains nearly 
always interact. 
●
●
We know that part of IQ is heritable, but it can also be greatly 
influenced by early childhood events and even nutrition. Studies 
estimate that about 50% of IQ is inherited. 
●
●
But with EQ, we run into a measurement problem because, 
unlike IQ, there isn’t really a universally accepted definition. 
We can look at the heritability of things such as neuroticism or 
extroversion, both of which are included in some models of EQ. 
We can also look at the heritability of things such as anxiety 
disorder or depression, but at present, we can’t say much about 
the heritability of EQ. 
Biopsychosocial Model

Lecture 10 | The Development of EQ
84
●
●
There are interesting findings looking at how our inherited 
biology might make emotion management easier or more 
difficult. For example, about 20% of adult American have a 
genetic mutation that makes them inherently less anxious and 
more able to forget fearful and unpleasant experiences. While 
this isn’t EQ per se, it influences emotional abilities.
●
●
Another example of innate advantages or disadvantages comes 
from personality research. Personality is thought to be innate and 
genetically determined. Some models of EQ, such as the one from 
Rueven Bar-On, explicitly include personality and temperament. 
The Big Five
●
●
There has been a good bit of research linking EQ with 5 different 
personality characteristics called the big five. In 1961, 2 U.S. Air 
Force researchers, Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal, analyzed 
personality data from 8 large samples. Using Raymond Cattell’s 
trait measures, they found 5 recurring factors. 
●
●
This work was replicated by Warren Norman, who also found 
that 5 major factors were sufficient to account for a large set of 
personality data. Cattell viewed these developments as an attack 
and called it the 5-factor heresy. Nonetheless, 5 factors seemed 
to work best.
●
●
But it was the 1960s, and behaviorism was on the rise. This was 
when John Watson famously claimed he could take any infant 
and turn him or her into any kind of person using classical and 
operant conditioning. Personality tests fell by the wayside. 
●
●
It wasn’t until the early 1980s, when John Digman dusted off this 
research, that it began to move forward again. The big five are 
different personality types that are captured in the acronym of 
OCEAN, in which the O stands for openness to experience, the 
C stands for conscientiousness, the E stands for extroversion or 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
85
introversion, the A stands for agreeableness, and the N stands 
for neuroticism. 
●
●
The 
5-factor 
model 
is 
accessed 
through 
2 
different 
questionnaires. The larger one is called the NEO Five-Factor 
Inventory. The shorter and more manageable one is called the 
Big Five Inventory, developed by Oliver John at the University of 
California, Berkeley. It has 44 items rated on a 1- to 5-point scale 
from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” 
●
●
Heritability and environment contribute about equally. The 
results from twin studies tell us that the category of openness 
to experience has a heritability of about 57%, extroversion about 
54%, conscientiousness about 49%, neuroticism about 48%, and 
agreeableness about 42%. 
●
●
The big five predict job performance, particularly in the realm of 
conscientiousness and neuroticism, with neuroticism negatively 
correlated 
with 
job 
performance. 
Interpersonal 
conflicts 
are predicted by low openness to experience, and again by 
neuroticism. Low agreeableness and low conscientiousness are 
correlated with juvenile delinquency. 
●
●
Conscientiousness predicts better medical adherence and better 
health. Neuroticism is linked with depression and anxiety, and 
both can contribute to cardiovascular and other diseases. Low 
agreeableness is related to anger and hostility, which is linked to 
cardiovascular disease. 
●
●
Temperament falls within the more general rubric of personality. 
Temperamental traits are a subset of personality traits. The 
bigger umbrella of personality includes cognitions, beliefs, 
attitudes, values, and morals, and temperament is just one thing 
that resides under that umbrella. 
●
●
Temperament 
refers 
to 
constitutionally 
based 
individual 
differences and reactivity in self-regulation in the domains of 

Lecture 10 | The Development of EQ
86
affect, activity, and attention. It has historically been linked to 
the biology of the person. Reactivity, an important variable, is 
measured in terms of latency, or how long does it take to turn on; 
duration, or how long does it last; and intensity. 
Parenting and the Socialization of Children
●
●
How does our social world influence the development of EQ? From 
birth, parents soothe their children. They are practicing emotion 
regulation in others, but they are also role-modeling strategies on 
how to manage emotions. Parents also induce positive emotions 
often without thinking about it. Consider a game of peek-a-boo or 
tickling as a positive-mood-induction strategy. 
●
●
Parents take care of basic needs, establishing a routine, and allay 
fears. Parents use distraction, reframing “He’s just being silly” or 
“It’s just a game” as a way to externally help with reappraisals.
●
●
Children begin to regulate emotions in the first 3 years of life. 
They find a favorite stuffed animal, pacifier, or blanket that they 
use to self-sooth and regulate their emotions. They like the 
repetitions of stories or Disney movies as a way to generate and 
experience and to learn from the same emotions over and over 
again. More sophisticated strategies emerge at ages 2 to 5. 
●
●
Their emotion control often starts by the internalization of 
parental rules. That’s a key part of their moral development. 
Toddlers may comply with a mother’s rules even when she’s 
not around to enforce them because they’ve internalized them. 
Toddlers can display empathy and sympathy. They will display 
distress if they see that another person is in pain, and they might 
even try to offer comfort. This is the beginning of management 
of emotions in others.
●
●
Unfortunately, parents usually overestimate children’s abilities 
to self-regulate. Most parents think that children under 3 can 
manage frustration and competently share and take turns, but 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
87
much of our emotional regulation comes with the interplay 
between our limbic system and prefrontal cortex. Because our 
frontal lobes aren’t fully developed until age 25, there’s a lot of 
neural development that has to happen before those regulation 
skills are in place. 
●
●
The other common mistake that parents make is they rush in 
to emotionally rescue their children, according to psychologist 
Susan David, who authored the book Emotional Agility. Children 
need practice in navigating their emotional world. They need to 
have their feelings validated and supported, but before managing 
their moods for them, see what ideas they might have and how 
they self-regulate. 
Children begin to 
regulate emotions in the 
first 3 years of life. They 
find a favorite stuffed 
animal, pacifier, or 
blanket that they use to 
self-sooth and regulate 
their emotions. 

Lecture 10 | The Development of EQ
88
●
●
To do an exercise that helps us think back to our emotional role 
models that we had while growing up, take out a piece of paper 
and draw a genogram, which is essentially a visual representation 
of your family tree. Usually, you start in the middle of the page by 
drawing a symbol to represent yourself. Your siblings are on a 
horizontal line with you, your parents are vertically above you, 
and grandparents are above them. 
●
●
Next, think about what emotion you want to follow. Are you 
interested in anger, fear, or grief? Think about a time when 
those emotions were expressed in your family. Who were the 
most influential people? What was the primary emotion that you 
associate with them? How did they express it? What did they 
mean? 
EQ in Older Adults
●
●
When it comes to EQ in older adults, we really aren’t talking 
about development, but we do see some changes. Older adults 
are more likely to attend to positive stimuli and to use memories 
to regulate emotion. Savoring happens more often, as do positive 
reappraisals. 
●
●
In explaining this positivity effect, Laura Carstensen and Joseph 
Mikels invoke automatic regulatory processes. They argue that 
because deliberate processing deteriorates in older age, it is likely 
that automatic emotion regulatory processing is responsible for 
the positivity effect. 
●
●
Indeed, the positivity effect has been found in a number of 
laboratory mood-regulation tasks. Older adults seem more 
automatically drawn to positive stimuli, even when they aren’t 
intending to do so. Perhaps this is wisdom, or maybe just a 
benefit of having an aging brain.

Lecture 11
Emotional Intelligence 
Training
I
t is estimated that more than 30,000 schools across the 
United States have a social and emotional learning (SEL) 
curriculum, which is a direct outgrowth of EQ research that 
explicitly acknowledges the close relationship between emotions 
and learning. SEL programs are intended to improve both the 
noncognitive and cognitive skills of children. Noncognitive, or 
EQ, skills are explicitly taught and rehearsed while cognitive skills 
are thought to improve implicitly as children are better able to 
concentrate, focus, and process their regular academic school 
lessons. This lecture will dig into this important SEL issue as well as 
other EQ training programs.

91
Social and Emotional Learning
●
●
Schools began emphasizing social and emotional learning around 
2011, after an analysis of 213 school-based programs teaching 
such skills found that they improved academic achievement by 
11 percentile points. A book extolling efforts to teach social and 
emotional skills in schools—such as the KIPP charter network at 
Riverdale Country School in New York—How Children Succeed 
by Paul Tough, appeared the next year.
●
●
SEL coursework is now well on the way to universal adoption 
to at least some extent. Objections are usually of the following 
varieties: Some argue that SEL shouldn’t be taking up curricular 
time because those skills are best learned in the real world—
from parents, friends, and life events. Children live emotions 
all the time, so why do we need to artificially create them in 
school? This is similar to saying that we shouldn’t have English 
class in school because most children speak English at home. 
There is an advantage to a structured, standardized curriculum 
that can raise skills. 
●
●
A second set of more compelling arguments comes from 
several EQ researchers. First, they say that there’s no reliable 
standardized way to measure EQ in schools. We don’t know 
where students are starting, and we don’t have a good way of 
determining the effectiveness of the programs. 
●
●
Second, we don’t have evidence on which strategies work, so if 
you are constructing a curriculum, how do you know what kinds 
of exercises or tools to put into that toolbox? There are very few 
randomized, controlled studies, so many are just observational 
findings. There seems to be a huge variability in the quality of 
the different SEL studies that are making an appearance in these 
30,000 schools around the country.
●
●
One such critic is a faculty member at the University of 
Pennsylvania, Angela Duckworth. In her work as a teacher, 
she noticed that there were certain students that were quite 

Lecture 11 | Emotional Intelligence Training
92
successful even if they didn’t fit the normal success profile. She 
found that those students had a lot of passion and perseverance, 
which she called grit, and she wrote a book entitled Grit and a 
TED Talk of the same name.
●
●
Duckworth is a proponent of helping children build noncognitive 
skills, whereas EQ may be too big and too messy. She 
recommends the use of her 12-item Grit Scale and found that grit 
greatly outperforms IQ in its ability to predict academic success 
and achievement. 
●
●
This is exciting and important work, but it isn’t an indictment of 
SEL programs—it is another type of SEL program. Grit is more 
parsimonious than EQ, and there is a lot of debate about what 
it really means. This bodes well for designing careful research 
studies. We don’t quite yet know, though, how innate versus 
teachable grit might be. Any improvements in grit might require 
improvements in emotion regulation skills, bringing us back to 
EQ and SEL programs. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
93
●
●
In her book Emotional Agility, Susan David says, “emotional skills 
are the bedrock of qualities like grit and resilience.” But instead 
of allowing a child to fully experience a negative emotion, 
parents often respond with what David describes as emotional 
helicoptering.
●
●
The biggest concern about testing for social and emotional skills 
is that it typically relies on surveys asking students to evaluate 
recent behaviors or mindsets, such as how many days they 
remembered their homework or if they consider themselves hard 
workers. This makes the testing highly susceptible to fakery and 
subjectivity. 
●
●
Duckworth further argues that even if students don’t fake their 
answers, the tests provide incentives for “superficial parroting” 
rather than real changes in emotional skills and behavior. 
SEL Programs
●
●
Even though SEL has the aspirational goal of improving emotional 
literacy, many school administrators aren’t that concerned about 
EQ, and the programs they adopt don’t necessarily grow from 
EQ models. Administrators may simply want fewer behavioral 
problems in school, better attendance, and better standardized 
test scores—because funding is often tied to these factors. 
●
●
Second Step, probably the most popular program, in about 
25,000 schools, is heavily scripted with modules based on skills 
and school year. It’s developed by the nonprofit Committee for 
Children and it can be found at www.cfchildren.org. It includes 
videos, games, vignettes, and even take-home exercises that 
help children build SEL skills. Because it is highly scripted, 
it is mostly one size fits all; it’s up to the skills of the teacher if 
adaptations need to be made. 
●
●
A contrasting example that is more rooted in cognitive behavioral 
skills comes from Karen Reivich, a psychologist at the University 

Lecture 11 | Emotional Intelligence Training
94
of Pennsylvania. The positive psychology curriculum she 
codeveloped and leads teaches adolescents how to overcome 
negative events. While part of the program involves academics, 
much of it deals with cognitive behavioral techniques modified 
for the classroom. 
●
●
The ABC model (for the interplay between antecedents, beliefs, 
and consequences) aims to help students assess a problem 
and their role in it and gain control of their environment 
and emotions—keys to managing emotions and preventing 
depression. The model is detailed in The Resilience Factor, 
coauthored by Karen Reivich and Andrew Shatte, who tell us that 
there are 7 ingredients for resilience: emotion awareness and 
control, impulse control, realistic optimism, flexible thinking, self-
efficacy, empathy, and reaching out.
●
●
Marc Brackett, an EQ expert and SEL developer, is concerned 
that there are so many different programs out there. He has his 
own program, called RULER, created with David Caruso, one of 
the key authors of the integrative ability model for EQ. 
●
●
RULER is much more intensive, and it requires much more teacher 
training—weeks of intensive training. It’s also much more expensive, 
about $100,000 per school. However, this program is quite 
rigorous and demands high-quality teaching, implementation, and 
evaluation, unlike many of the other programs. Given the intensity 
and the cost, however, it probably won’t be possible to scale up 
this program without losing its fidelity.
●
●
A meta-analysis of 213 school-based SEL programs published 
in 2011 by Joseph Durlak and Roger Weissberg looked for 
outcomes in more than 270,000 students. Compared to controls, 
SEL students improved socially, emotionally, and academically, 
reflecting an 11% gain in achievement.
●
●
A slightly different type of study done more recently by 
Christopher Houck and David Barker in 2016 looked at a more 
focused emotion regulation intervention for adolescents to 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
95
delay sexual activity. Their program was called Get Out, Let It 
Out, and Think It Out and was based on James Gross’s modal 
model of emotion and his research on emotion regulation. They 
were looking at situation modification, attentional deployment, 
response modulation, and cognitive changes and found that 
with intervention, adolescents were less likely to have sex and to 
either engage in or suffer from violent behavior after 1 year.
●
●
Susan David leaves us with some practical and helpful advice for 
parents, regardless of what may or may not be happening in their 
child’s SEL program at school. She recommends the following: 
›
›
Feel it. Many families focus on pushing away negative emotions. 
Parents often tell their children not to be sad, mad, angry, 
jealous, or selfish. Parents need to validate and see their child 
as a sentient person who has his or her own emotional world.
›
›
Show it. Many families have what are called display rules around 
emotions: There are emotions that are acceptable to show and 
those that must be hidden. When they are shown, they might 
Parents often tell 
their children not to 
be sad, mad, angry, 
jealous, or selfish.

Lecture 11 | Emotional Intelligence Training
96
be highly regulated or reformed. This teaches children to be 
afraid of their emotions. 
›
›
Label it. Labeling emotions is a critical skill set for children, 
who need to be able to recognize stress as compared to anger 
or disappointment. Even very young children can consider 
whether they’re mad, sad, or glad. 
›
›
Watch it go. Even the most intense emotions don’t last forever. 
Parents should help their children see that sadness, anger, and 
frustration all have value, but they also pass. They’re transient, 
and we are bigger than they are. 
●
●
Outside of schools, we have work programs, executive 
coaching, diversity training, managing conflict, responding to 
microaggressions, and building empathy. 
●
●
The capacity for empathy is considered a core skill that is necessary 
for EQ—particularly for accurately assessing and responding 
to the emotions of others. When someone is being emotionally 
unintelligent, it is often because he or she has failed to read the 
situation correctly or has forgotten the need to connect and relate. 
●
●
In EQ terms, there may be impairment in emotion perception, 
emotion understanding, and emotion regulation. But fortunately, 
empathy can be improved with training. 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
●
●
A number of work training programs borrow from interventions 
first developed in clinical settings. Acceptance and commitment 
therapy (ACT) was developed by Steven Hayes at the University 
of Nevada, Reno, in the late 1980s.
●
●
ACT differs from traditional cognitive behavioral therapy in 
that rather than trying to teach people to better control their 
thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories, and other private 
events, ACT teaches them to “just notice,” accept, and embrace 
their private events, especially previously unwanted ones. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
97
●
●
The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is 
caused by experiential avoidance, cognitive entanglement, and 
resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take 
needed behavioral steps in accord with core values. 
●
●
ACT says that all of our problems are due to FEAR:
›
›
Fusion with your thoughts
›
›
Evaluation of experience
›
›
Avoidance of your experience
›
›
Reason-giving for your behavior
●
●
The healthy alternative is to ACT:
›
›
Accept your reactions and be present
›
›
Choose a valued direction
›
›
Take action
●
●
ACT has 6 core principles for psychological flexibility. 
›
›
Cognitive defusion: Learning methods to reduce the tendency 
to reify thoughts, images, emotions, and memories. 
›
›
Acceptance: Allowing thoughts to come and go without 
struggling with them.
›
›
Contact with the present moment: Awareness of the here and 
now, experienced with openness, interest, and receptiveness.
›
›
Observing the self: Accessing a transcendent sense of self, a 
continuity of consciousness that is unchanging.
›
›
Values: Discovering what is most important to one’s true self.
›
›
Committed action: Setting goals according to values and 
carrying them out responsibly. 
●
●
In a study published by Jessica Swain and colleagues in 2013, a 
systematic review of 38 different studies offered preliminary 
support for a broad spectrum of anxiety disorders when treated 
with ACT.

Lecture 11 | Emotional Intelligence Training
98
●
●
Another study, published by Vivien Hunot and colleagues in 2013, 
was a Cochrane review but looked at the treatment of depression 
only. This included ACT with a few other therapies that looked 
at acceptance-based approaches, such as mindfulness. There 
were only 3 randomized, controlled trials for 144 subjects, but 
they found that ACT was equal to cognitive behavioral therapy in 
another treatment called behavioral activation.

Questions to Consider
1.	 We often hear that children in the United States are behind 
their peers in math or science skills. Are they also behind in 
emotional and social skills? How could we test that? 
2.	 Should socioemotional learning programs be limited to a 
particular age range? If so, what is the range? Is it ever too 
late to learn the basics?

his lecture is on social intelligence (SI), which is a related 
concept to emotional intelligence, but it brings some 
important and interesting new facets. Social intelligence will 
also serve as another variable to consider when trying to predict 
why some people succeed while others fail. It has substantial 
overlap with EQ, and this lecture will explore the many similarities 
and differences.

Social Intelligence
●
●
Social intelligence is the capacity to effectively negotiate complex 
social relationships and environments. Skills for interpersonal 
effectiveness might include listening mindfully, figuring out what 
you feel toward others and what you might want or need from 
them, being able to make assertive requests, navigating conflict, 
helping others feel comfortable, and having charisma or charm.
●
●
Sociobiology is a field of scientific study that is based on the 
assumption that social behavior has resulted from evolution 
and attempts to explain and examine social behavior within that 
context. On the most basic level, it’s all about mating, competing 
for resources, and fighting to survive and procreate. We’re talking 
about the reptilian and mammalian brains, hierarchy, dominance 
and power, and mating displays.
●
●
David Brooks, author of The Social Animal, and others remind 
us that although we are mammals, we have large frontal lobes. 
We have that most advanced part of our triune brain. We may 
still have the urge to beat our chests, but we can choose to do 
something different.
●
●
Advances in neuroscience are helping us understand exactly 
how social connections occur. We seem to be innately wired 
to connect through a special type of cell called mirror neurons. 
When someone gives us a big grin, the impulse is to grin back. 
When you see someone in pain, you wince in sympathy. These 
are your mirror neurons in action. 
●
●
Another person’s emotional state is creating a similar emotional 
state within your brain—hence the name mirror neurons. Mirror 
neurons help us predict the behavior of others near us by 
subconsciously mimicking their emotions and behaviors. This 
helps us feel as they feel and move as they move; there is an 
obvious survival advantage here.

It’s cliché to say that people need people, and this idea of love 
and attachment is the thing that music, art, literature, and movies 
are made of. But is it true? Can’t being alone or even totally 
isolated be just fine? 
●
●
In studies of young orphans in eastern Europe, 40% of the 
isolated orphans die before the age of 2. They are given food 
and water, kept clean, and given medical care, but something 
happens. They seem to die of loneliness. 
●
●
You may be thinking that this might be true for infants, but they 
are vulnerable and that there’s a critical window when we need 
a loving, nurturing relationship. But what about the 35,000 
suicides per year involving many people who are socially isolated 
and depressed?
●
●
In a study looking at myocardial infarction, or heart attack, 
published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers looked 
at about 200 people who had recently had a heart attack, and 
no matter how they divided the patients—by age or gender, for 
example—social supports equaled a better chance at survival.

Greater perceived support, especially perceived availability of 
emotional support, has also been found to predict lower mortality 
risk among women with breast cancer. During pregnancy, greater 
perceived and received social support are linked to fewer labor 
complications and better birth outcomes.

●
There is solid support for the biological and medical 
consequences of having social relationships. We are still learning 
about all the biological pathways to cause a social phenomenon 
such as a relationship to be transduced into biology within your 
body—how the outside gets inside. 
EQ versus SI
●
●
Emotions are a highly evolved means of communicating changes 
in our environment, relationships, and interpersonal needs. So, 
by definition, they already have a strong social function. We 
certainly feel emotions when we are alone, but remember that 
all emotional experience is goal directed: It’s about approach or 
escape avoidance. 
●
●
The processing or emoting we do on our own is probably related 
to social relationships, cultural rules, or challenges or threats we 
think that the social world will throw in our direction. We perceive 
emotions to gather data on what’s going on. We use emotions to 
facilitate thought and cognition, understand emotions so that we 
can accurately read a situation, and regulate emotions in the self 
or others depending on their utility given our context. 
●
●
In the social realm, you add implicit rules we have internalized to 
guide social interactions (of course, these are highly influenced 
by culture), including how you greet someone, which fork you 
pick up for your salad, and what you say when you learn there’s 
been a death in someone’s family. We’ve learned hundreds or 
even thousands of rules.

In a 2008 paper in the American Psychologist, John D. Mayer, 
Peter Salovey, and David Caruso summarized a number of 
studies that show that EQ predicts social outcomes and social 
well-being and more prosocial behaviors. Of the 4 arms of their 
model, emotion management seems to be the most socially 
powerful and important. 
●
●
Just as higher EQ predicts more favorable social outcomes, 
lower EQ is associated with interpersonal conflict and lower 
levels of well-being, according to Mayer and colleagues. For 
example, adolescents lower in EQ were rated as more aggressive 
than others and were observed to be more prone to engage in 
conflictual and antisocial behavior than their higher-EQ peers, 
according to studies by Brackett and colleagues in 2004 and 
Mayer and colleagues in 2001.
Skills and Social Contingencies
●
●
What are some of the skills and social contingencies, or learned 
rules, that govern our behavior? Daniel Goleman describes 
different features of SI that we should consider as we try to 
better understand this complex skill set. 
In the social realm, 
we have added 
implicit rules to guide 
social interactions, 
including what you 
say when you learn 
there’s been a death 
in someone’s family.

Lecture 12 | Social Intelligence
104
●
●
The first is called the protoconversation. As you start to have a 
social exchange, a great deal of activity is taking place. You are 
taking in microexpressions, body language, and pheromones 
and processing language. This category includes your social 
instincts—your gut feeling about another person. Can you 
sense the other person’s feelings or intentions? It also includes 
awareness about yourself, such as how you come across to 
others and what messages you might unintentionally display. 
●
●
The next SI category is social triggers. Think about what 
threatens you. Is it a fear of rejection or of being wrong or alone? 
Our preexisting beliefs and worries—in part based on past life 
experiences—will very much color how we interact in social 
experiences. 
●
●
With anxiety, there is a high road and a low road. The low road 
represents lower-order brain functioning in the limbic system, 
such as the amygdala. It’s quick, dirty, and inaccurate. The high 
road is more neocortex and, specifically, the frontal lobes. It is 
the careful and accurate but slow system. 
●
●
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky call this system-1 and 
system-2 thinking. It is important in social situations because it 
drives our emotional reactions. Have you ever had an exchange 
where you felt irrationally angry at someone or where you left 
feeling energized and connected? If automatic, these are probably 
low-road influences. In reality, there’s probably some high-road 
cognitions or interpretations of the social situation in there, too. 
●
●
As we grow older and more socially skilled, it is often our high 
road tamping down our low road. Maybe there were reasons to 
be afraid as a child, but those days are over. Your low road just 
has trouble changing or forgetting. 
●
●
If you’ve had a social interaction that didn’t go well, it is important 
to have a place to process and learn from the experience. In the 
medical profession, this is called a postmortem. You want to 
know what went well and what didn’t go well. What emotional 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
105
signals were sent or received? If you could rewind, how would 
you change it? What did you learn, and what might you do 
differently next time? 
●
●
If you’d like to work on your SI, create a template for a debrief 
after social encounters, collecting data and looking for patterns 
and opportunities. 
Cultivating and Assessing SI
●
●
Can you cultivate social intelligence? Initial studies of children 
have been successful in teaching socioemotional skills, including 
listening, asserting oneself, cooperating, and apologizing. These 
can be taught on the playground or intentionally integrated into 
curricula. But what about at work or home? What about for adults 
with decades of social habits that may or may not be socially 
intelligent?
●
●
The Social Intelligence Institute has one of the most popular 
and well-researched programs available. It can be found online 
at www.socialintelligenceinstitute.org, which offers a self-
administered, multimedia Internet course consisting of 10 hours 
of content. The modules include reading facial expressions, 
understanding your unconscious brain, and how to click with 
another person. Alex and Eva Zautra published a validation of 
the program in 2015 using a slightly different version and found 
positive results. 
●
●
Although there do seem to be some unique features of social 
intelligence as compared to emotional intelligence, there are 
surprisingly few specialized SI measures. The 2 most commonly 
used are the Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI) 
by Goleman and the EQ-i by Reuven Bar-On, both of which were 
described in lecture 2. 
●
●
There are specific measures for particular skills, such as 
communication. For measures of social skills—not quite the same 

Lecture 12 | Social Intelligence
106
as SI—most of the measures are designed for school children. 
One of the most commonly used with the best psychometrics 
is the Home and Community Social Behavior Scales, which 
are completed by both parents and their children. Another 
commonly used method is direct observation. 
Problems in Social Situations
●
●
One of the most common problems that arises in social 
situations and interactions is a failure of empathy, where we 
use other people as objects instead of people. It’s called 
instrumentalizing. We see them as necessary for a function but 
forget that they’re human beings. 
●
●
We might use other common habits of mind, such as mind reading, 
which involves imagining what the other person must be thinking. 
We might try fortune telling, or predicting the future, and adapt 
our behavior accordingly. There is also mood contagion, where 
you pick up the mood of the individuals around you. 
One of the most 
common problems 
that arises in social 
interactions is a 
failure of empathy.

●
●
We have implicit bias. As we’re forming our identities, we decide 
to which groups we belong and to which groups we don’t 
belong. For your in-group, you begin to distort membership in 
that group in a positive direction. For the out-group, you start to 
make negative assumptions about that group. 
●
●
We’re also influenced daily by media messages that help shape our 
opinions about people—particularly people in the out-group. This 
gives rise to microaggressions, which are brief and commonplace 
daily verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities and insults. 
●
●
Microaggressions communicate negative messages to target 
persons based solely on their group membership or identity. 
They typically occur as a result of unconscious or implicit bias. 
Although the intent may not be to insult, undermine, or discount, 
the impact is often negative. Even though you intend to have 
a particular consequence in a social situation, there may be 
unpredicted or unintended consequences or effects that you 
have on other people.
●
●
An approach developed by the UCSF School of Nursing 
called HEALS—which stands for halt, engage, allow, learn, and 
synthesize—helps you respond to a microaggression or an 
unwanted or offensive comment that comes up.
›
›
Halt the discussion. Pause to consider the comment, image, or 
message that you received. You might ask the person to clarify 
to help you understand it. Express appreciation for raising 
the issue, providing an opportunity to discuss an important 
element or aspect of your relationship. Focus on the idea, 
deconstructing the comment without placing the individual on 
the defensive. 
›
›
Engage with the issue. Who is or could be affected? Check 
your own response. Check the room: Look for body language 
and other reactions of the group members, and then go there 
and discuss the issue.

Questions to Consider
1.	 How does the concept of social intelligence add to our 
understanding of EQ, IQ, and relationships? How is it similar 
or different?
2.	 How is social media influencing the development of social 
intelligence? There are rewards (“likes” and views) and 
punishments (being blocked or ridiculed). Isn’t this just 
another form of social learning?

his lecture will provide a quick tour of attachment theory, 
intimacy, and EQ. In this lecture, you will explore basic 
attachment theory as it relates to EQ and intimacy. You 
will even look at an exercise that claims to make people fall in 
love with you. 

Lecture 13 | Intimacy and EQ
110
Attachment
●
●
John Bowlby developed and described attachment theory, 
which was later empirically supported and revised by Mary 
Ainsworth. The ability for an individual to form an emotional and 
physical attachment to another person gives a sense of stability 
and security necessary to take risks, branch out, and grow and 
develop as a personality. It is the child’s first attachment to a 
caregiver, usually a parent who allows the child to develop strong 
relationships as an adult. 
●
●
We might hypothesize that parents with higher EQ might have 
more securely attached children because they would be better 
at perceiving a child’s emotional state, validating that state, and 
effectively regulating the child’s emotions, providing comfort 
when needed. 
●
●
The classic categories of attachment styles are secure, insecure 
anxious, insecure avoidant, and insecure disorganized. These 
names have varied slightly over time, but the categories have 
remained the same. 
●
●
The categories were determined from hundreds of studies 
of thousands of babies and toddlers in a test known as the 
Strange Situation Procedure, in which usually mother and child 
are together in a room being observed. The mother is told to 
leave the room and leave the toddler alone or sometimes with 
a stranger. The toddler’s behavior is observed when the mother 
leaves, while the mother is gone, and when she returns. 
●
●
A securely attached toddler will explore freely while the 
caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, may be 
visibly upset when the caregiver leaves, and is usually happy to 
see the caregiver return. 
●
●
Toddlers on the insecure-anxious—sometimes called the insecure-
ambivalent—end of the spectrum are usually wary of strangers 
and will get upset when mothers leave. These toddlers run to their 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
111
mothers when they return; however, these toddlers aren’t easily 
soothed, usually because the caregiver has been an unreliable and 
unpredictable source of comfort in the past. The toddlers may have 
a tantrum as if they are angry. As adults, they tend to overthink 
their relationships and may be overly dramatic. They may hound 
romantic interests for reassurance instead of taking it slow.
●
●
Insecure-avoidant children will avoid or ignore the caregiver. They 
won’t register distress when their caregivers leave, and they don’t 
show much interest when caregivers return. These toddlers have 
become used to being either ignored or smothered based on 
the parent’s needs and not their own. Insecure-avoidant adults 
tend to have trouble with intimacy. They may value and want 
relationships but are more likely to leave relationships, particularly 
if they are going well. They tend to be bad at communicating their 
feelings and may avoid attempts from others to bond. 
Toddlers on the 
insecure-anxious end 
of the attachment 
spectrum will get 
upset when their 
mothers leave and 
run to their mothers 
when they return.

Lecture 13 | Intimacy and EQ
112
●
●
The insecure-disorganized category is really just a mix of the 
prior 2 insecurely attached categories, primarily because the 
toddler’s behavior varied too much. Nonetheless, they may also 
have difficulties with relationships as adults. 
●
●
A meta-analysis indicates that about 30% of toddlers are 
insecurely attached due to caregivers who were distracted, 
dismissive, unreliable, absent, or perhaps threatening. This gives 
them, as adults, a flawed working model of relationships. It’s a 
model—one low on trust and high on negative emotion—that 
needs to be unlearned and corrected. 
●
●
Although the concept of EQ wasn’t around when Bowlby 
and Ainsworth were doing their work, there are some clear 
similarities. The parents of insecurely attached children have 
failed in their role to regulate emotions in their children and to 
teach them their own EQ skills. 
●
●
This is important because as we think about intimacy, it helps 
us understand that the roots run very deep. Maybe someone 
is having a difficult time building intimacy, seem cold or aloof, 
has dramatic reactions to perceived rejections, or seem utterly 
relieved when a healthy relationship ends. These seemingly odd 
behaviors might go all the way back to the person’s attachment 
style as a toddler. 
●
●
Knowing the etiology doesn’t change it, but it does provide 
an explanatory model, and when we have explanation for our 
behavior, it helps us reappraise the situation: She isn’t just being 
difficult, or he isn’t just a cold fish. They have missed the love and 
security that all children deserve. 
●
●
In a study by Romina Samadi and colleagues published in 2013, 
300 students were assessed for attachment styles and given the 
Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory. Samadi found that secure 
attachment was positively correlated with EQ abilities and stress 
management skills. Several other studies have validated this 
finding.

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
113
●
●
The study that we haven’t yet seen is showing that EQ training 
can alter attachment styles and relationship quality. We do 
know that EQ is correlated with marital or other relationship 
satisfaction, so it would make sense that if EQ improves, then so 
would relationship and attachment. 
Relationships
●
●
Unfortunately, the current state of affairs with relationships in the 
United States isn’t great. Families are now more dispersed than 
ever before. We are still electronically connected, but we don’t 
have those close-knit extended families living within a few miles 
of one another.
●
●
About 1 in every 4 households is a single person. Half of all 
marriages end in divorce, and about 36% of Americans report 
themselves as lonely. Is this a modern epidemic? Is this a 
consequence of people moving to urban centers? 
●
●
We don’t know exactly what’s going on, but there are a few 
different possibilities. We’ve certainly become a much more

mobile society, where people move more often, change jobs 
more often, or change schools more often. 
●
●
We have been cultivating and promoting a culture of 
independence and individualism, which de-emphasizes the 
value of interpersonal bonds. We’ve seen growing workloads 
and longer work weeks; we’ve seen more financial struggles and 
difficulties, which mean more work time and less family time. 
●
●
What can we do about this? There obviously isn’t an easy solution, 
and any improvement would probably require a multipronged 
approach, including sweeping social changes, such as shorter 
work weeks or better family leave. But it’s also about values and 
how the value of intimacy seems to have been diminished.
●
●
This is where EQ comes in and how EQ training programs can 
help. EQ helps us express and perceive emotions, a necessary 
skill for the development of intimacy and in being able to 
experience and respond to loneliness. 
●
●
EQ helps us understand why intimacy might be waning or why 
we feel the emotion of longing or malaise. EQ helps us regulate 
emotions in ourselves and others by helping us appreciate the 
bidirectional effects that our emotion and emotion regulation 
strategies have. Cognitive behavioral therapy or acceptance 
and commitment therapy provide important tools to help us 
remember our values, reappraise our situations, and do some 
creative problem solving. 
●
●
We’ve talked about emotion dynamics in terms of latency, 
valence, speed, and duration. Relationships have dynamics, 
too. They may wax and wane, be intense, or be mellow and 
comfortable. 
●
●
In terms of EQ, we can think of relationships as potent triggers 
(think situations) that draw our attention, activate cognitions, 
and produce emotional states. Because relationships occur over 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
115
time, we establish a pattern and collection of memories—our 
histories together. 
●
●
Just as we have habits of mind, we also have habits of the heart. 
You may have a tendency to withdraw. You may feel rejected. 
You may have a tendency to engage in passive-aggressive 
behaviors or to be very competitive with your spouse. 
●
●
In terms of EQ, it’s important to be aware of what is threatening 
to you. Is it rejection? Is it the fear of not being right? Is it not 
being respected? Is it being suffocated? Threats activate our 
reptilian brain, our amygdala, which responds with emotions such 
as fear or anger to help you react. Being emotionally intelligent 
means knowing your habits of heart and being able to adjust to 
match the realities of the situation.
Intimacy
●
●
There’s not one magic formula for deepening intimacy because 
relationship dynamics will vary, but there are a few core common 
concepts. 
›
›
Time. This means uninterrupted quality time where you’ve 
clearly made one another a priority. Shared events, shared 
struggles, and shared history are all the raw materials that can 
build intimate moments. 
›
›
Risk or vulnerability. To become close to someone, you have 
to allow him or her in. And this means being willing to expose 
yourself—to show your weakness and risk ridicule or rejection. 
›
›
Communication. Conflicts will inevitably arise, but if you have 
the tools to resolve the conflict, it can often make you stronger. 
●
●
In January 2015, The New York Times posted an article that 
quickly went viral. It claimed to present the 36 questions that 
would make someone fall in love with you. It was based on the 
research of psychologist Arthur Aron, who used 3 sets of 12 
questions, with each set becoming more intimate and familiar. 

Lecture 13 | Intimacy and EQ
116
●
●
Aron says, “One key pattern associated with the development 
of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, 
reciprocal, personal self-disclosure.” Hence, he created a series 
of guiding questions to help 2 people become more intimate. 
Examples from each of the 3 sets, in increasing intimacy, are as 
follows: What would constitute a perfect day for you? What do 
you value most in a friendship? When did you last cry in front of 
another person?
●
●
The results of Aron’s study were published in the Personality 
and Social Psychology Bulletin. He found that individuals using 
the intimacy questions were more successful in building a close 
relationship than comparison subjects that just made small talk. 
The part about making someone fall in love with you was just a 
headline. Google the article title “The 36 Questions That Lead to 
Love” if you are interested in trying this with a friend or loved one. 
It’s a fun and sometimes poignant exercise in intimacy building. 
●
●
To assess intimacy, in a clinical setting, we usually look for 
triangulation, which involves 3 different sources of data that

we then overlap and compare with one another. First, we give 
each individual in the couple self-report surveys about their 
relationship. This often includes perceptions of how things are 
now versus how he or she would like them to be. Second, we 
interview each member of the couple separately. Third, we 
interview and observe them together. From this, we can develop 
a working formulation of how to best help the couple. 
●
●
A sample survey is the Experiences in Close Relationships-
Revised, which is a 36-item self-report attachment measure 
developed by R. Chris Fraley, Niels Waller, and Kelly Brennan 
in 2000. The survey yields scores on 2 subscales: avoidance, 
sometimes broken into discomfort with closeness and discomfort 
with depending on others; and anxiety, which includes fear of 
rejection and abandonment. A self-scoring version of the survey 
is available online for free at www.yourpersonality.net.

Interpersonal Conflict
I
n this lecture on EQ and conflict, the goal is to shine some 
light on the role emotions play in conflict and negotiations. 
Even under the best circumstances, conflict can be an 
uncomfortable experience that activates a lot of emotions. This 
lecture will try to unpack this big topic by looking at the emotions 
involved in conflict and how those emotions affect the ways we 
think and communicate.

Conflict in Social Groups
●
●
Conflict in social groups has to do with clashes between social 
groups that see one another as different. Culture gives us emotion 
display rules, directs our attention, shapes our cognitions, and even 
teaches us emotion regulation strategies. Similarly, our process of 
identifying with a culture and a subculture tells us to what groups 
we belong—such as men, women, LGBT, Irish, Southern, Christian, 
Democrat, or Republican. The list seems almost endless. 
●
●
These group memberships are important because they shape 
the way we process information. We assume that people that 
belong to our in-group are similar to us. We are more likely to 
give them the benefit of the doubt. Depending on the group, we 
may be more likely to give them help. 
●
●
For someone who belongs to an out-group, we do the opposite: 
We may assume the worst of them, may be more argumentative 
and less flexible, and may assume that all those others are all the 
same. This in-group/out-group dynamic happens all the time. 
●
●
Group membership isn’t bad; it gives us an identity and helps 
facilitate social support. Humans are tribal, and we need our tribe 
to fit in and survive. 
●
●
But going into a conflict situation, you have to be aware of how 
you identify yourself and how your conflict partners identify 
themselves. We don’t enter into a situation with a clean slate. We 
enter in with all of our wonderful, terrible messiness chock-full 
of bias. 
●
●
The right way to apologize depends on the infringement, but 
some general guidelines can be taken from Steven Scher and 
John Darley in the Journal of Psycholinguistic Research. There 
are 4 parts to a good apology: 
1.	 You have to express remorse. You have to use “I” statements 
and actually say the words “I’m sorry” or “I apologize.” 

Lecture 14 | Interpersonal Conflict
120
2.	 You have to admit responsibility and demonstrate that you 
understand how what you did has affected the other person 
and made him or her feel. You’re demonstrating empathy. 
3.	 You have to make amends. Don’t just say, “Let me know if 
there’s anything that I can do.” That puts the impetus on the 
other person. You need to say, “Please, tell me what I can do to 
make amends.” 
4.	 You need to promise that it won’t happen again. Conflict might 
have broken trust, and you want to try to rebuild that trust by 
promising that it was a one-time thing.
●
●
A unique approach to handling conflict comes from the 
Georgetown University undergraduate program, where they, 
like many college campuses, often struggle with the tensions 
between free speech and hate speech. You might have heard 
about safe spaces and trigger warnings, but Georgetown created 
Red Square, where students can say anything they want, in any 
way they want, but they have to leave it behind. The policy was 
a compromise to give student groups a place to assemble and 
recruit without having disruptive protests all over the city. 
Many college campuses 
often struggle with the 
tensions between free 
speech and hate speech.

●
●
We know from the emotional-regulation literature that emotion 
suppression comes with a high physiological cost: The emotion 
has already happened and done its damage, and it takes a lot of 
energy. But we’ve also learned that giving in to emotional urges 
can intensify the emotion. 
●
●
We also know that establishing group membership creates in-
group versus out-group biases, but people are going to cluster 
in groups nonetheless. Red Square encourages expression, gives 
permission, and allows protests or even movements to form, but 
then students are told to leave it all behind. There hasn’t been 
any data on the outcome of this natural experiment, and there 
clearly aren’t any easy answers. Only time will tell if the “leave it 
behind” part works or if it just goes underground when outside 
of Red Square. 
●
●
Whether in a free speech zone or not, intense conversations and 
conflicts sometimes emerge when we least expect them to. How 
do you manage them? Should you engage in them? Based on 
what we know about EQ, intimacy, and social intelligence, what 
might we do? What might be our rules for survival? Are there 
rules of engagement—really guidelines on conflicts—that would 
help us navigate difficult situations? Much of it comes from our 
starting assumptions, and these may seem intuitive and obvious 
but are often forgotten.

same things.

If protests happen and rage is expressed, know that that is also 
part of the process. Our country was founded on protests and 
freedom of expression. We don’t have to agree, but we do need 
to find common ground through compassion, kindness, and 
emotional intelligence. 
Dyadic Conflict
●
●
Dyadic conflict is conflict between 2 friends, spouses, or 
whomever. It occurs on a smaller scale than big political conflicts 
but can still be quite charged. 
●
●
George Bernard Shaw tells us that the single biggest problem 
with communication is the illusion that it has taken place. It’s 
tongue-in-cheek but all too true. Miscommunication occurs 
regularly and drives a lot of conflict. 
●
●
There’s been much written and studied about differences in how 
men and women communicate. Men spend about 2/3 of social 
conversations talking about themselves, are less likely to pick up 
on emotional cues, and are less likely to take turns or give openings 
to someone else. Men report and women engage in rapport talk. 
Much of this was summarized and made popular by John Gray, 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
123
who wrote Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, or by 
Deborah Tannen, who wrote You Just Don’t Understand.
●
●
How do we go about assessing communication? We might use 
self-report surveys, interviews, reports from others, and even 
observational studies. Another methodology uses trigger-tape 
studies, where you watch a stimulus and then have to generate 
a response.
●
●
The Interpersonal Communication Skills Test assesses 5 categories 
of key skills: insightfulness, verbal expression, assertiveness, 
listening skills, and emotional management—a sort of road map 
to the essential competencies to having a healthy, emotionally 
intelligent conversation.
●
●
There are 5 basic requisites for discussion of emotions. 
1.	 You have to be able to access your emotion. You can’t 
communicate your emotion if you’re in denial about it. 
2.	 You need verbal communication skills to talk about your 
emotions. 
Dyadic conflict is 
conflict between 
2 friends, spouses, 
or whomever. 

Lecture 14 | Interpersonal Conflict
124
3.	 There needs to be a necessary level of self-esteem. You have a 
right to feel and pursue your own goals. 
4.	 There needs to be a safe environment.
5.	 You need to have a willing and able partner.
●
●
How can you improve communication skills? There are 2 people: 
the sender/talker and the listener. You need to pick a good time 
for the conversation. You need to clearly express what you need 
and to make it clear, having realistic expectations, sticking with 
one issue at a time, and being aware of your own and the other 
person’s verbal and nonverbal signals. If you are the listener, you 
need to work on eliminating distractions, improving nonverbal 
and verbal cues, and using empathic statements.
●
●
Drawing from the couple’s emotion regulation research of Robert 
Levenson and others, we see that higher marital satisfaction 
is associated with less suppression of negative emotions. We 
also see that the inability to regulate negative emotions at all 
increases the likelihood of partner violence.

Questions to Consider
1.	 What role does the news media or marketing play in 
triggering, escalating, and/or changing emotions that lead 
to conflict? How can we strengthen our emotional immune 
system so that we are not so easily triggered and misled?
2.	 What kinds of conflict cause permanent damage to 
relationships? If healing cannot occur, what progress can be 
made? Does forgiving someone resolve the conflict?

Lecture 15
EQ in the Workplace
I
n this lecture, you will learn how EQ manifests in the workplace 
and what kinds of outcomes it might predict. The concept 
of EQ is now prominently represented in nearly all business 
school curricula and is commonly found in workplace and 
leadership training programs. This lecture reviews the history and 
current research on how and why EQ matters in the workplace.

Lecture 15 | EQ in the Workplace
126
Why EQ in the Workplace Matters
●
●
The average American spends nearly 100,000 hours at work 
during his or her lifetime, and U.S. workers currently put in 
around 1800 hours at work per year. We need a framework to 
help treat occupational stress, but we also need a framework 
that helps us understand success. 
●
●
To determine what predicts success—such as intelligence, 
socioeconomic status, or ambition—we first have to decide what 
success means. Is it money, advancement, prestige, status, growth, 
or satisfaction? This is a fairly personal issue with no correct 
answer. Interesting research shows that objective measures of 
success and subjective success are often quite different things. 
●
●
Let’s take a middle-of-the-road definition and say that success 
isn’t making millions and isn’t being a CEO but does include 
advancement, recognition, compensation, and constructive 
relationships with peers, bosses, and/or supervisees. It includes 
a reasonable level of satisfaction and contentment. What do you 
need to get there?
●
●
A 2006 study by Accenture of 251 executives in 6 countries 
concluded that while intelligence is important for career success, 
it’s a matter of how you are smart. Interpersonal competence, 
self-awareness, and social awareness—all elements of emotional 
intelligence—are better predictors of who will succeed and who 
won’t.
●
●
Recall the primary definition of EQ developed by John D. Mayer, 
Peter Salovey, and David Caruso: “the ability to perceive and 
express emotion, assimilate emotion in thought, understand and 
reason with emotion, and regulate emotion in the self and others.” 
●
●
Note the 4 elements, defined as abilities or skills that can be 
trained: The ability to express and perceive emotion, use emotion 
(harness for cognitive tasks), understand and reason with 
emotion, and regulate or manage emotion in the self and others.

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
127
●
●
Remember the alternate model of EQ that was developed by 
Daniel Goleman. It is the one that is most commonly adopted 
by businesses, and variants of that model are taught in most 
business schools. Goleman conceptualized EQ as a set of skills 
and personal competencies. He described 5 domains: knowing 
your emotions; managing your own emotions; motivating 
yourself by marshaling emotions, such as delaying gratification 
or entering flow states; recognizing and understanding other 
people’s emotions; and managing relationships. 
●
●
These competencies can be visualized in a 2-by-2 table with 
regulation and recognition on one side and self and social on 
the other side, giving us 4 quadrants that capture all 5 elements: 
3 in the column for self and 2 for social. Keep in mind these 4 
quadrants and their relationship to motivation and collaboration 
in the workplace. 
●
●
In 1998, Goleman presented specific business adaptations in his 
book Working with Emotional Intelligence. In the book, he defines 
an emotional competence as a learned capability based on 
emotional intelligence that results in outstanding performance at 
work. He identified a total of 25 relevant emotional competencies 
that fall into personal and social categories. 

Lecture 15 | EQ in the Workplace
128
●
●
The social competencies are particularly relevant in a work 
setting.
›
›
Empathy: The awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and 
concerns. Empathy competencies include understanding 
others, developing others, leveraging diversity, and political 
awareness.
››
Social skills: The adeptness at inducing desirable responses in 
others. This category includes influence, communication, conflict 
management, leadership, change catalyst, building bonds, 
collaboration and cooperation, and team capabilities—all of 
which are highly relevant to success in a work setting.
●
●
When it comes to predicting success, the outcomes we are 
interested in are somewhat more specialized than general 
studies of EQ. In work settings, metrics might include employee 
satisfaction, job turnover rates, job engagement, productivity, 
and even the overall success of the organization. There have 
been some big claims about EQ in business settings, and those 
were somewhat hyperbolic. It is important, though, not to dismiss 
EQ entirely.
Empathy competencies 
include understanding 
others, developing 
others, leveraging 
diversity, and political 
awareness.

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
129
●
●
Research has shown that EQ can help predict positive outcomes, 
such as sales, high performance, stress management, and 
creativity. But it might also play a role in removing negative 
incidents, such as work-related accidents. 
●
●
In one study, emotional abilities were 4 times more important than 
IQ in determining professional success and prestige. An analysis of 
independent studies found a correlation of 0.23 between EQ and 
performance. But EQ was also highly correlated with personality. 
A study of store managers in a retail chain found that the ability to 
handle stress predicted net profits, sales per square foot, sales per 
employee, and sales per dollar of inventory investment.
Emotionally Unintelligent Behaviors
●
●
What are some of the common emotionally unintelligent behaviors 
you might see at work, and what can you do about them? First, 
you want to regulate your own emotions and then perhaps do 
something to regulate the emotions in your coworkers. 
●
●
Remember all the categories in the ER continuum and try to 
rely more on antecedent-focused strategies: situation selection, 
situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive 
reappraisals. You will also need to do some response modulation. 
What kinds of emotional unintelligence emerge?
›
›
Insensitivity, or not taking into account the needs or 
preferences of other people, often stems from a lack of 
empathy and may reflect early family dynamics. As with 
most, because we often don’t know what’s driving a particular 
behavior, it’s important to assume the best. Consider building a 
relationship with the individual, and use cognitive reappraisals 
to manage your own emotions.
›
›
Arrogance can often mask underlying emotions. Use somatic 
quieting to avoid escalation. You need to understand where the 
arrogance is coming from. It might be a long-standing pattern 
that’s the product of family upbringing, culture, or privilege. To 

Lecture 15 | EQ in the Workplace
130
some, optimism might seem arrogant, so it might be a matter 
of interpretation. It might also be social anxiety masquerading 
as arrogance, which alienates other people. Giving these 
individuals 360° feedback often helps.
›
›
Rigidity may stem from many different causes, such as 
arrogance, anxiety, or even conscientiousness from someone 
who works really hard and wants to do a good job. Thank these 
types of people for their passion but request openness and 
flexibility, primarily through suggestions and role modeling.
›
›
Volatility reflects poor emotion regulation abilities. Volatile 
people don’t have a filter and have emotional outbursts. This 
may be culturally driven. These individuals need mentorship 
and feedback using concrete examples of when they’ve been 
volatile and “I” statements. There are a number of cognitive 
behavioral therapy and dialectic behavior therapy skills that 
could help these individuals.
Emotional Intelligence Training at Work
●
●
According to the Association for Talent Development, 4 out of 
5 companies now offer some variant of EQ training. Although 
what is in vogue has changed—work culture is particularly hot 
right now—these programs often include many of the same 
competencies that are part of the Goleman model. Unfortunately, 
there is huge variability in these programs, and almost none 
are carefully evaluated. Fortunately, there are exceptions, and 
important research is ongoing. 
●
●
The Rutgers University–based Consortium for Research on 
Emotional Intelligence in Organizations has led the way in 
catalyzing this scientific work, collaborating with organizations 
that range from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to 
American Express.
●
●
The life insurance division of American Express created an EQ 
training program to first help with client relationships and sales 
and then expanded the program to include manager training. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
131
It targeted virtually every aspect of emotional intelligence, but 
particularly the competencies of emotional self-awareness, self-
control, empathy, communication, and conflict management. 
●
●
They’ve tried a number of variations in training length and 
training methods, and the strongest results come from 2 to 3 
days of experiential training with a month to practice, followed 
by another 2 to 3 days of training. The first half covers self-
awareness and self-management, and the second half focuses 
on interpersonal effectiveness. 
●
●
And it seems to work. Comparing intervention to control sites, 
participants saw a 13.5% improvement in their Attributional 
Style Questionnaire scores—they become more optimistic. More 
impressively, sales increased 10% and revenues increased 20%. 
There have been a number of validation trials showing that the 
program is worth the investment. 
Arrogance can 
often mask 
underlying 
emotions.

Today, companies around the world use EQ when hiring, 
promoting, and developing their employees. Johnson & Johnson 
found that in divisions around the world, those identified at mid-
career as having high leadership potential were much stronger in 
EQ competencies than were their less-promising peers.

Lecture 16
Occupational Stress and 
Burnout
I
n this lecture on occupational stress and burnout, you will 
learn about the current state of the American worker, explore 
occupational stress, and then define the disorder called 
burnout. The lecture will end by analyzing how EQ and other 
interventions can help.

Lecture 16 | Occupational Stress and Burnout
134
How Much We Work and Why
●
●
There has been an important social ebb and flow in how much we 
work and why. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, workdays 
were routinely 12 or even 16 hours long. The average workweek 
was 60 hours. With the advent of unions, collective bargaining, 
and progressive labor laws, the workweek declined to around 40 
hours after World War II and the traditional 9-to-5, Monday-to-
Friday model. 
●
●
Currently, Americans work an average of about 35 hours per 
week, versus 30 hours per week in France and 27 hours per week 
in the Netherlands. But these kinds of broad averages can be 
deceiving.
●
●
Over the past several decades, we’ve seen a big shift from 
manufacturing to white-collar service jobs, with particularly 
large growth in health care and technology. And while we have 
seen some national economic growth, salary growth has been 
relatively flat for middle- and lower-class jobs, necessitating 
longer hours and sometimes having a second job. 
●
●
In fact, 30% of U.S. workers are often or always under stress at 
work, and work stress has increased 300% since 1995. About 40% 
of missed work is due to stress, and 80% of on-the-job accidents 
are stress related. Problems at work are more strongly associated 
with health complaints than are any other life stressor—more so 
than even financial problems or family problems.
Occupational Stress
●
●
Occupational stress is the experience of stress caused by work 
and/or occupational demands. Recall that stress includes 
biological symptoms, emotional changes, behavioral changes, 
and cognitive consequences. Remember that the stressor 
is anything real or imagined that sets off the whole chain of 
events—in this case, something in the workplace. Recall, too, that 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
135
it isn’t just about the external situation; it’s also about how we 
think about it: our primary and secondary appraisals. 
●
●
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health says 
that human health and social work employees are at greatest risk. 
Accountants and bookkeepers are at surprisingly high rates of 
burnout. Large companies tend to have more stress and burnout. 
People who work the night shift, weekend hours, or overtime are 
also at greater risk. It’s estimated that it cost the United States 
about $42 billion a year in lost productivity. If you include the 
cost of health care, that number rises to $300 billion.
●
●
The top 10 most stressful jobs, in order of decreasing stress, 
are as follows: enlisted soldier, firefighter, airline pilot, air traffic 
control, police officer, event coordinator, intercity school teacher, 
taxi driver, customer service operator, and EMT. 
●
●
General risk factors include a perceived lack of control, high 
demand or job strain, greater disparity between effort and 
reward, and greater perceptions of being exposed to “threats” 
and fewer “challenges” to grow and develop. 
Being a police officer 
is one of the top 10 
most stressful jobs.

Lecture 16 | Occupational Stress and Burnout
136
●
●
Tom Cox says that there are a number of work-specific factors 
that can predict job stress and job burnout: excessive workloads, 
conflicting demands and lack of role clarity, lack of involvement 
in making decisions that affect the worker, lack of influence over 
the way the job is done, poorly managed organizational change 
along with job insecurity, ineffective communication and lack of 
support from management and colleagues, and psychological or 
sexual harassment or even third-party violence. 
●
●
Protective factors include high perceived control, high reward 
matches high demand, a bump in social status, and deriving a 
sense of meaning or purpose from your job. 
●
●
To measuring occupational stress, we can assess the individual, 
the working group, or the workplace. We could analyze self-
report questionnaires, use independent observers, or examine 
objective data from the company or business (statistics on 
staff turnover, satisfaction surveys, financial indicators, or HR 
complaints).
●
●
To measure individual stress, you could use measures such as the 
Perceived Stress Scale. If you want to include the work context, 
the Occupational Stress Inventory has 140 items and looks at 
occupational stress over 3 dimensions: occupational stress, the 
psychological strain on the individual, and the coping resources 
available to that individual. 
●
●
What are some of the medical consequences of occupational 
stress? The findings on occupational stress and cancer 
are somewhat controversial because it’s unclear if it’s the 
occupational stress or the occupational exposures that could 
increase an individual’s risk for cancer. Occupational stress is 
related to up to 3 times the rate of back pain, and this also seems 
to be true for other forms of stress. There are also strong findings 
linking cardiovascular disease to occupational stress. 
●
●
There is also the behavior aspect. When we’re stressed, we tend 
to do things that harm us, such as drinking more alcohol and 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
137
smoking cigarettes. We have a worse diet and exercise less, and 
our sleep is sometimes disrupted.
●
●
What are some ways to combat work stress? There are 
environmental changes that you can make, such as changes in 
amount of light, temperature, noise, and space. You can decrease 
levels of ambiguity and give employees more predictability, 
or better descriptions of what expectations might be. You can 
institute a process of shared decision making so that employees 
feel as if they have a voice. You can try to make the work more 
interesting. You can promote social relationships and give 
rewards for good work.
●
●
Other ways to combat work stress include using positive-emotion 
exercises, such as beginning a daily gratitude journal or trying 
an exercise where you ask yourself 3 questions at the end of 
each workday to shift your tension to something positive: What 
surprised me today? What moved me today? What inspired me 
today? You can also use your cognitive behavioral therapy skills, 
such as positive reappraisals and recalibrating your perspective 
or expectations.
Occupational 
stress is related to 
up to 3 times the 
rate of back pain.

Lecture 16 | Occupational Stress and Burnout
138
EQ and Stress
●
●
Recall the EQ model that involves the perception and expression 
of emotion, the understanding of emotion, and the regulation 
of emotion in the self and others. EQ can influence our work 
performance and relationships at work in many ways. 
●
●
Occupational stress can be thought of as a special subset of 
stress overall. It specifies the context in which the stress occurs—
your job—and brings in more variables regarding workload, 
interpersonal dynamics, and even how your job affects your 
identity and sense of worth. 
●
●
As with general stress, it is likely that EQ trait models are highly 
correlated with occupational stress. Recall that measures such 
as the EQ-i even include a subscale for stress management skills. 
●
●
In 2009, a study done by Muhammad Ismail and colleagues 
looked at the role of EQ in mediating the relationship between 
work stress and job performance. In other words, they wanted to 
see if EQ could buffer stressed employees and allow them to still 
be productive. The results were positive. 
●
●
A study of 180 nurses in Spain found that nurses who score 
high in emotional clarity and emotional repair reported less 
stress, whereas those with high scores in attention to emotions 
experience greater levels of stress.
Workaholism and Burnout
●
●
Workaholism increases the risk of divorce by about 40%, and 
a burst of increased work hours can temporarily improve 
productivity but eventually erodes into low efficiency and 
performance. 
●
●
The Bergen Work Addiction Scale was developed by clinical 
psychologist Cecilie Andreassen and her team at the University 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
139
of Bergen after testing 12,000 Norwegian workers from 25 
different industries. The scale uses 7 questions that reflect the 
hallmark behaviors of individuals who have work addictions.
●
●
Workaholism influences work norms, stresses others out who try 
to keep up, and creates toxicity. Eventually, it causes job conflict 
and job loss. Workaholics don’t necessarily get burned out, but 
those around them do. 
●
●
Burnout is a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and 
emotional exhaustion, cynicism and detachment, and feelings of 
ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.
●
●
Social psychologists Christina Maslach and Susan Jackson at 
the University of California, Berkeley, have done much of the 
original work that has defined the field—as well as the disorder 
and how it is measured. More recent work has suggested that the 
exhaustion symptom is really the driver of the syndrome. 
●
●
Psychologists Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North have 
theorized that the burnout process can be divided into 12 
phases, which are not necessarily followed sequentially: the 
Workaholism influences 
work norms, stresses 
others out who try to 
keep up, and creates 
toxicity.

Lecture 16 | Occupational Stress and Burnout
140
compulsion to prove oneself, working harder, neglecting personal 
needs, displacement of conflict, revision of values, denial of 
emerging problems, withdrawal, obvious behavioral changes, 
depersonalization, inner emptiness, depression, and burnout.
●
●
Some evidence suggests that burnout is clinically similar to 
depression. In a 2013 Journal of Health Psychology article by 
Renzo Bianchi, depressive symptoms in burned-out workers were 
compared to clinically depressed patients. No diagnostically 
significant differences were found between the 2 groups.
●
●
Moreover, a study by Bianchi and colleagues showed that 
about 90% of burned-out workers meet diagnostic criteria 
for depression, suggesting that burnout may be a depressive 
syndrome rather than a distinct entity. The view that burnout is a 
form of depression has found support in several recent studies.
●
●
Christina Maslach, Wilmar Schaufeli, and Michael Leiter identified 
6 risk factors for burnout: mismatch in workload, mismatch in 
control, lack of appropriate awards, loss of a sense of positive 
connection with others in the workplace, perceived lack of 
fairness, and conflict between values. 
●
●
The job-demands model of burnout proposes that burnout is 
influenced by job demands and job resources. Job demands 
are the physical and psychological costs of work, such as 
work pressure and emotional demands. Job resources are 
organizational aspects of the job that help employees manage 
job demands. 
●
●
A review by Evangelia Demerouti in the Journal of Applied 
Psychology found that job demands are most closely related to 
the exhaustion component of burnout while lack of job resources 
is most closely related to disengagement. Demerouti also 
importantly showed that burnout was not just found in human 
service or health-care jobs but was found in a number of other 
professions, too. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
141
●
●
In an interesting study published in the International Journal of 
Nursing Practice, Eunyoung Hong and Young Sook Lee used 
structural equation modeling to show that EQ reduces job 
stress, burnout, and turnover intention. Perhaps EQ serves as a 
protective factor, but EQ training might also serve as a treatment. 
●
●
The most common measure of burnout is the Maslach Burnout 
Inventory (MBI), named after Christina Maslach. It operationalizes 
burnout with the classic 3 dimensions: exhaustion, cynicism and 
detachment, and ineffectiveness. The MBI is a 22-item survey 
that uses a 7-point scale. It has been used in hundreds of studies 
and really doesn’t have a competitor. But it isn’t free. 
●
●
Ways to combat burnout include time away from work, change 
in job description, reengagement with sources of meaning, and 
better work-life balance.
●
●
Most burnout prevention and treatment programs are based on 
cognitive behavioral therapy, which makes good sense given 
its empirical support for the treatment of depression. We could 
use activity scheduling, cognitive reappraisals, somatic quieting, 
physical exercise, and problem solving. 
●
●
It’s helpful to have a quick intervention that can be done in 
the middle of day, perhaps even several times a day. We want 
to trigger somatic quieting to reduce the stress response, 
but we also want to build skills in concentration, focus, and 
nonjudgment—the things you typically see in mindfulness.

Questions to Consider
1.	 If a person is burned out at work, does that mean that he 
or she by definition has been emotionally unintelligent? 
What part of burnout is attributable to the person versus 
attributable to work?
2.	 It has been said that all emotions, including negative ones, 
have a purpose. Does burnout have a purpose? If so, what?

Lecture 17
Leadership and EQ
I
n this lecture on leadership, you will explore what makes a 
good leader and whether EQ plays a meaningful role. EQ has 
been identified as an important factor in promoting work 
performance in general, and some have suggested that EQ may 
be even more important for leaders and managers. As you climb 
the ladder, your emotional style and emotion regulatory capacity 
affects larger groups of people, and the intensity of the emotional 
situations to be handled increases greatly. This lecture reviews the 
literature on leadership and how emotions may play a role.

Lecture 17 | Leadership and EQ
144
Leadership Styles
●
●
The whole notion of positional leadership—that people become 
leaders by virtue of their power or position—is being challenged. 
In this older model, you simply get promoted until you reach 
your level of incompetence, and then you stay put. There is no 
leader selection, training, or development. 
●
●
These days, leaders are instead being asked to inspire team 
loyalty through their expertise, vision, and judgment. Leaders are 
seen as creators—at least in part—of workplace cultures and are 
drivers of employee engagement. 
●
●
There are 3 classic leadership styles used in the business world:
›
›
Laissez-faire leadership: Mostly hands-off with minimal direction 
and face time from the manager to the staff. For this style, you 
need trained and efficient intermediaries between you and your 
employees.
›
›
Autocratic leadership: This is a bit of a relic, but we all probably 
know someone like this. This is the dictator, the absolute 
powerful decision maker who cares little for input from others. 
It’s quick and efficient but comes with many other costs. 
›
›
Participative leadership: This is a sort of blend of the first 2 types. 
This leader is more hands-on but includes the input and 
creativity from employees. 
●
●
Two newer styles have more recently been studied:
›

Transactional leadership: This style gets things done within the 
current methods accepted by the industry. Many people 
refer to these method as a “by the book” management style. 
Transactional leadership is comprised of contingent reward 
and management by exception (focusing on the mistakes of 
workers). Here, it isn’t about inspiring your workers; it’s about 
rewards and punishments—transactions.

Transformational leadership: These are the creative thinkers, the 
disrupters who want change in as many ways as possible. This 
type of leader inspires people to perform well. 
Assessing Leadership Styles
●
●
Recent EQ research has been used to assess the EQ 
characteristics present in different leadership styles. 
●
●
Bernard Bass and Bruce Avolio developed the most popular 
instrument for measuring transformational and transactional 
leadership: the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). 
Newer versions of the MLQ have a third style of non-transactional 
leadership, which is still very similar to laissez-faire leadership.
●
●
Recall the Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI) 
developed by Daniel Goleman and Richard Boyatzis. The ESCI 
is a 360° instrument that allows the leaders, their supervisors, 
their peers, and their supervisees to rate them on behavioral 
indicators of the EQ competencies. 
●
●
Remember that the ESCI is based on Goleman’s EQ model, so it 
has 4 quadrants, or distinct areas of abilities: self-awareness, social 
awareness, self-management, and relationship management. 
Within those 4 areas, the ESCI lists 12 competencies. When 
leaders get their ESCI 360 report back, they are able to see how 
they perform in all of those competencies. 
●
●
An analysis of more than 300 top-level executives from 15 
global companies by Lyle Spencer showed that 6 emotional 
competencies distinguished stars from the average: influence, 
team leadership, organizational awareness, self-confidence, 
achievement drive, and leadership.
●
●
Using the James Gross model of emotion regulation, Chi-Sum 
Wong and Kenneth Law looked at both leader and follower EQ. 
They show that the EQ of followers affects job performance 

Lecture 17 | Leadership and EQ
146
and job satisfaction, while the EQ of leaders affects follower 
satisfaction and extra-role behaviors, or going the extra mile. 
●
●
Deloitte results showed, on average, an equity premium of up to 
15% for organizations with perceived effective leadership and a 
discount of as low as 19% for organizations that were perceived 
to have ineffective leadership. 
●
●
These results reinforce an old saying: Leaders make and 
break organizations every day. Leadership and culture are the 
crosshairs that, when coordinated, can make for a competitive 
advantage in an organization. 
●
●
Building from the EQ and leadership literature, PepsiCo identified 
9 core leadership competencies, assessed their leaders, and then 
tracked performance. Their list of 9 included several EQ-relevant 
concepts, such as empathy, self-confidence, political awareness, 
and adaptability. They found that if a leader had at least 6 of the 
9 competencies, his or her performance jumped by 15%. 
Leadership Development
●
●
According to the Global Human Capital Trends report in 2016, the 
leadership challenge is urgent and growing in importance. In 2016, 
89% of companies see leadership development as an important 
or very important issue while 28% of respondents reported 
weak or very weak leadership pipelines. Only 7% of companies 
believe they are “excellent” at building millennial leaders. Only 
13% of companies report they are “excellent” at building global 
leaders. Only 14% of companies surveyed described themselves 
as “strong” at succession planning throughout the business.
●
●
In 2016, companies spent nearly $31 billion on leadership 
programs, but many of the programs seemed driven by fads, 
with little theoretical or scientific basis behind them. The Global 
Human Capital survey tells us that 40% of survey respondents 
believe that their current leadership programs provide only 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
147
“some” value, and 24% report that they yield little to no value. 
This provides a strong argument that we need something new.
●
●
In 2012, Macquarie Group Limited, a global investment banking 
and diversified financial services group, reevaluated its leadership 
development programs. Macquarie launched a pilot program in 
early 2014. Offered to a selection of associate directors located 
in Macquarie’s major hub cities in Europe, Asia, Australia, and 
the United States, the program consisted of 2 3-day workshops 
delivered over a 12-month period, supplemented with a series of 
one-on-one coaching sessions, a 360° assessment, and a skilled 
volunteering experience.
●
●
They were not taught how to behave, but how to think. Built 
around 6 core capabilities, such as setting direction, inspirational 
leadership, and collaboration, this flexible and innovative 
approach to learning allowed the content to be applied easily 
across business lines and geographies. And unlike many 
programs, Macquarie evaluated the program and got results. 
●
●
EQ researchers have noted the lack of quality work in leadership 
development and have created a consortium to address the

programs.

problem. The Rutgers University–based Consortium for Research 
on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations has led the way in 
catalyzing this scientific work. Today, companies use EQ for 
hiring, promoting, and developing their employees. 
●
●
Executive coaching has become a popular method for promoting 
emotional intelligence in organizations through leadership 
training. However, there have been few rigorous evaluations of 
such programs.
●
●
The initial assessment may consist of an in-depth interview, a 
360° assessment, and work simulations. The coach helps the 
client use the data from the assessment to set development 
and learning goals and priorities. As the name implies, it is 
more coaching—more hands-on and more directive than 
psychotherapy. 
●
●
A common teaching method in business schools is to carefully 
examine case studies. Sometimes it is a post-mortem, picking 
apart and analyzing disastrous outcomes. Other times, it is a 
study of success. 
●
●
Anne Busquet, formerly the head of the American Express 
Optima Care division, is a good example of how executive 
coaching can correct EQ deficiencies. Anne was demoted after 
it was discovered that several of her employees had hidden 
millions of dollars in losses. She was not directly responsible, but 
it was in part due to her leadership style. 
●
●
Anne was highly perfectionist and critical and had created an 
environment of fear. Her employees were afraid to tell her about 
the losses, so they hid them. Much to her credit, she went to 
executive coaching to soften her style. She became the head of 
the ailing American Express merchandise division and was able 
to make it again profitable in part due to her improved patience 
and better listening skills.

●
●
In a study looking at performance feedback and self-confidence, 
MBA students were praised, were criticized, or received no 
feedback. The criticized and no-feedback groups equally 
suffered. A good leader must give feedback but has to be 
tolerant of employee mistakes and help them grow and learn. 
●
●
Some of the greatest business leaders and innovators in recent 
times don’t seem to be particularly emotionally intelligent. 
Although perhaps no formal assessments have been made, 
biographical data suggest that Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry 
Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk aren’t particularly high in 
EQ—although they certainly have other remarkable skills instead. 
EQ is just one factor, but it probably is neither necessary nor 
sufficient to be a great leader. It’s probably a great help in most 
situations, but there’s too much counterevidence to suggest that 
it is a necessity.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Name a highly successful leader or politician that you think 
might have low EQ. Why has he or she been so successful? 
2.	 Is a great leader born that way, or can it be learned? How 
much of leadership success is related to EQ?

Lecture 18
Workplace Culture
T
hese days, companies are zooming ahead at breakneck 
speed, narrowly dodging obstacles, hoping to stay alive, 
with unlucky employees falling off here and there—but the 
determined survive, and the CEO keeps the pedal to the metal. 
Fortunately, success and a frenetic pace don’t necessarily have 
to go hand in hand. We can intentionally construct and change 
our work cultures to be healthier and happier. In this lecture, you 
will learn about the definition of culture in a work context, the 
factors that shape culture, and some interesting programs that are 
intended to change cultures.

Culture
●
●
Culture is a system of values, beliefs, and behaviors that shapes 
how actual work gets done. Whether intentional or accidental, 
every workplace has a culture, and we all take part in an iterative 
process both experiencing and creating it.
●
●
According to Deloitte Consulting, culture is one of the most 
talked about business topics of 2016. An overwhelming 82% 
of respondents in Deloitte’s 2016 Global Human Capital Trends 
report believe that culture is a potential competitive advantage. 
However, only 28% of respondents stated that they know their 
culture, and only 19% believe that they have the “right” culture. 
●
●
There have been substantial changes to work culture driven by 
the use and integration of technology, a diversifying workforce 
that includes more millennials, and moving to work models 
that include more focus on networks and teamwork. A new 
social contract is emerging between employees and employers. 
Employees are more like free agents now; it’s not typical for 
people to accept a job in their 20s and commit to the same 
company for life.
●
●
What affects culture?
›
›
Leadership. How does a leader communicate? What is his or 
her interactive style? What is his or her vision for the future, or 
expectations? What rewards are given or taken? What stories 
does he or she tell? What sort of narrative does the company 
have? How does he or she make decisions? To what extent is 
he or she trusted? What beliefs and perceptions does he or she 
reinforce?
›
›
Management. This includes the systems in place, policies 
and procedures, structure of the organization, hierarchy, 
organizational chart, and goals and objectives. Our employer is 
empowered to make decisions. What’s the consistency? What’s 
the support and interaction with the employees?

Lecture 18 | Workplace Culture
152
›
›
Workplace practices. This includes the recruitment of employees, 
the hiring of employees, the onboarding process, compensation 
and benefits, rewards, recognitions, promotions, performance 
management, and wellness—many things normally controlled 
by HR.
›
›
Policies and philosophies. This would include attendance policies, 
dress code, and code of conduct as well as organizational 
philosophies, 
such 
as 
hiring, 
compensation, 
pay 
for 
performance, and internal transfers and promotions.
›
›
People. This includes people’s personalities, beliefs, values, 
diverse skills and experiences, and everyday behaviors. This also 
includes interactional styles. Is there a norm of confrontation 
between coworkers? Is it a highly polite environment? Is there 
socializing at work or even outside of work? What’s the ratio 
between collaboration and competition?
›
›
Mission, vision, and values. Clarity of mission, vision, and values 
and whether they honestly reflect the beliefs and philosophies 
of the organization is an important ingredient. How inspiring 
are they to employees? To what extent are the mission, vision, 
and values stable, widely communicated, and continuously 
emphasized?
›
›
Work environment. This includes the objects, artifacts, and 
other physical signs in the workplace that give you clues about 
the type of culture that exists. What do people place on their 
desks? What does the organization hang on its walls? How 
does it allocate space and offices? What do those offices look 
like? Are there common areas? What do those common areas 
look like, and how are they used?
›
›
Communications. 
This 
includes 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
communication occurs in the workplace; the degree, type, and 
frequency of interactions and communication between leaders 
and employees, and managers and employees; and the extent 
of transparency in sharing information and making decisions.
●
●
Across all of these categories, organizational details, and 
processes, there is an almost implicit tone—an emotional sense 
of how a workplace feels. A culture high in EQ will be aware of 
both the explicit and implicit emotional messages it sends—

153
and even the little things count as positive and negative. How 
is innovation recognized and rewarded? How is employees’ 
medical leave managed? How is a downturn in business 
communicated to others?
●
●
Organizations that actively manage their cultures typically have 
30% higher levels of innovation and 40% higher levels of retention.
Engagement
●
●
In contrast to culture, engagement is about employees’ level of 
commitment to the organization and their work. This involves the 
emotional responses to the culture at hand. 
●
●
Companies with highly engaged workforces outperform their 
peers by 147% in earnings per share, and their employees are 
87% less likely to leave. It seems that emotion management plays 
a big role in building engagement and promoting retention.
●
●
In Deloitte’s 2016 Global Human Capital Trends report, 9 out of 10 
executives surveyed cited culture and engagement as important or

very important. Yet only 12% of companies surveyed in 2016 believe 
they understand their culture. In 2015, less than half (46%) reported 
that they are prepared to tackle the engagement challenge.
●
●
Companies that proactively manage culture demonstrate 
revenue growth over a 10-year period that is, on average, 516% 
higher than those who do not. However, companies should 
recognize that culture and engagement—while linked—are 2 
different concepts.
●
●
What predicts engagement? A study by Edward Mahon, 
Scott Taylor, and Richard Boyatzis looked at the relationship 
of EQ, shared vision, shared positive mood, and perceived 
organizational support on employees’ degree of organizational 
engagement. They found that these 3 things have a direct, 
positive association with engagement and that EQ amplifies the 
effect of shared vision and perceived organizational support.
●
●
One of the signs you might expect to see in a healthy culture that 
promotes engagement is what happens at 5 pm, or whenever the 
usual day is supposed to end. Are people heading out 5 minutes 
early or staying late? What happens in staff meetings?
●
●
Do people interact with one another, or are they all focused on 
the leader, awaiting their orders? How many initiatives have come 
from the bottom up? What is quality control like? Do people pay 
great attention to detail and take pride in their work? Do they go 
the extra mile to help customers even if it isn’t their job?
●
●
If they see a coworker who is overwhelmed and busy, do they 
step in to help? How does communication flow? Do you see 
bottom up and top down in equal amounts? 
Values and Behaviors
●
●
Deloitte tells us that when organizational culture is aligned to 
business strategy, the workforce will act and behave in ways that 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
155
support the achievement of business goals. It’s the leader’s duty 
to uphold the values and beliefs of the organization’s culture 
through his or her actions and decisions. This, in turn, enables 
the execution of strategy. 
●
●
Culture, leadership, and strategy are the triumvirate that together 
steer the organization toward excellence—and much like any 
triumvirate, being in sync is necessary for an effective working 
relationship. 
●
●
Just as people have core beliefs or conditional assumptions in 
the cognitive behavioral therapy sense, businesses have mission 
statements. They may articulate values. But even more important 
than what is written down is what is actually done. What are the 
business practices? How are the employees treated? How are 
problems solved?
●
●
Cary Cherniss and Daniel Goleman tell us that an organizational 
mission statement serves an emotional function: articulating the 
shared sense of goodness that allows us to feel that what we do 
together is worthwhile. Working for a company that measures its 
success in the most meaningful ways—not just the bottom line—
is itself a morale and energy raiser.
In a healthy culture 
that promotes 
engagement, 
people interact 
with one another.

Lecture 18 | Workplace Culture

●
●
Just as we collect stories for a person to create a case 
formulation, a business consultant will collect stories about a 
business to create a formulation of that organization’s culture. 
This includes the health of the organization but also the 
contributing or detracting factors. One of the biggest warning 
signs is occupational stress and professional burnout.
●
●
Culture changes slowly, and it can take years before the new 
behaviors become embedded in the organization. Organizations 
need to have a broad approach to analyzing, measuring, and 
monitoring their culture, in an effort to shape and manage it 
effectively. 
●
●
One such measure is the Organizational Climate Questionnaire, 
which has 18 items divided over 6 different dimensions, all 
scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale from “almost never” to “very 
frequently.” It measures things such as organizational support, 
member quality, openness, supervisory style, member conflict, 
and member autonomy. This scale asks you to rate the questions 
twice: first noting what your business is actually like and a 
second time noting what your business would ideally be like. The 
questionnaire is free and available online.
Improving Work Culture
●
●
Most MBA programs have adopted some variant of EQ training—
particularly those that attract very bright but highly analytic and 
perhaps not so socially skilled people. 
●
●
Case Western’s Weatherhead School of Management created a 
year-long training program for their business students but also 
offer it to other professionals. The course has 1 3-hour session 
per week and starts with a critical self-examination of personal 
values and goals—something that probably doesn’t happen 
enough in business or other professional training programs. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
157
●
●
After the self-examination, students take up to 7 weeks to assess 
personal and social competencies. Based on these assessments, 
they develop personalized learning plans over the next 5 weeks. 
This unique, tailored approach allows each person to get exactly 
what he or she needs—maybe more practice with reading 
facial expressions, more practice on how to work a room at a 
professional function, or how to manage angry outbursts. 
●
●
When the year is complete, students on average show an 
improvement in 86% of the abilities, and they seem to maintain 
the gains at an extended follow-up.
●
●
Culture Path, developed by Deloitte Consulting, was the winner 
of the top HR product for 2016 and is an example of a tool for 
culture change. It has 8 indicators. The core indices include 
collective focus, risk in governance, external orientation, and 
change in innovation. Differentiating indices include courage, 
commitment, inclusion, and shared beliefs. You can filter their 
assessment results by department, division, location, or level.
●
●
Alyson Daichendt, a managing director with Deloitte Consulting 
and a thought leader in Deloitte’s Culture and Engagement 
practice tells us that we must recognize that the employee-
work contract has changed. Employees are acting more like 
free agents, forcing leaders to think about and learn to build 
an organization that engages the workforce and brings work 
and life closer together. Leaders, more than ever, need to learn 
how to build organizations that engage employees as sensitive, 
passionate, creative contributors.
●
●
Their group identified critical elements that make organizations 
“irresistible”: meaningful work, supportive management, positive 
work, growth opportunities, and trust in leadership. These critical 
elements are reinforced through work culture. 
●
●
While top-down creation and adaptations of culture are common, 
culture can also come from the bottom up. Culture is our lived 
experience every day at work. There are structures in place to 

Lecture 18 | Workplace Culture
158
guide our behavior, but we can choose to follow or to diverge. 
We can share a kind word, help a colleague with work, or provide 
positive feedback or even manage up—discreetly guide and 
support our leaders. Ultimately, whether from the top or bottom, 
change will require skillful emotional awareness, understanding, 
and regulation.

e’ve all experienced stress caused by situations beyond 
our control, but how many of us have been able to turn 
them into successful careers? This lecture will start 
with a review of stress, stress physiology, and the basics of stress 
assessment. From there, the lecture will move into strategies to 
help reduce stress, with a particular focus on how EQ can help.

Stress
●
●
Stress is a highly orchestrated response to a perceived threat 
or challenge that includes biological, behavioral, cognitive, and 
emotional elements. A stressor is the real or imagined thing that 
sets off the process. One of the things that makes us human is 
we can become stressed about an entirely imaginary event.
●
●
The transactional model of stress gives us a cognitively mediated 
understanding of why we get stressed. It starts with a potential 
stressor followed by our primary and secondary appraisals, 
which are how we think about the stressor. 
●
●
The primary appraisal is an appraisal about the stressor itself: 
Is it big? Is it serious? Does it matter? Secondary appraisals are 
about our coping resources or our ability to meet that threat or 
challenge. If you have a strong primary appraisal and a weak 
secondary appraisal, then you’re probably going to have a big 
stress response.
●
●
The last step in the process is the stress response, which includes 
the physiologic, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral elements.
●
●
All stressors aren’t created equally. Sometimes, events are 
classified as challenges, and sometimes they’re classified as 
threats. Both activate our sympathetic nervous system—which is 
responsible for emotional arousal—but it’s the threats that cause 
the lasting damage to our bodies. 
●
●
What makes an event stressful? Is it negative? Is it controllable? 
Is there some level of ambiguity or novelty? Are you already 
overloaded? Is the event central to values or a life domain that’s 
very important to you? Is it a chronic (ongoing) stressor, or is it 
acute (one time only)? Good events, such as moving to a new 
city, can also be stressful. 
●
●
To understand stress physiology—the juice that drives this whole 
process—you really only need to know about 2 complementary

161
systems: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the 
sympathetic-adrenal medullary (SAM) system. 
●
●
The HPA is responsible for the release of a stress hormone called 
cortisol. As a hormone, it’s secreted into the blood and exerts 
its effects throughout the body for a period of time. The SAM is 
an entirely different system. It’s responsible for our fight-or-flight 
response and operates via adrenaline. 
●
●
If your significant other gives you a hug or physical affection, 
or if you get a massage or listen to relaxing music, it activates 
your parasympathetic nervous system, which gives us a rest-
and-digest response, causing essentially the opposite of a stress 
response. 
●
●
Herbert Benson calls it the relaxation response, which is defined 
by decreased respiration, decreased heart rate, lowered blood 
pressure, and decreased blood to muscles. There is even lower 
blood sugars, lower cortisol, and lower adrenaline levels. 
●
●
Fortunately, there are many different ways to activate a 
relaxation response. It tends to require focused concentration, a 
quiet environment, and a passive (non-goal-oriented) attitude. 
Massage 
activates your 
parasympathetic 
nervous system.

Lecture 19 | Stress Management
162
●
●
With the autonomic nervous system, it is an automatic system, 
but there does seem to be variability between individuals, such 
as biological and genetic differences. There are also differences 
in life experiences—particularly those early in childhood that may 
rewire our autonomic nervous system so that it becomes more 
reactive, or has more intense reactions that last longer. 
●
●
Fortunately, we can train the autonomic nervous system. For 
example, we can lower our blood pressure through learning 
biofeedback. Meditation, a form of somatic quieting, can turn 
down the volume on our sympathetic nervous system. 
●
●
We need our stress response system to sensitively respond 
to real and imagined threats. It can save our lives, but if it is 
extended for too long, in too intense of a way, it can cause or at 
least contribute to chronic disease. 
●
●
How is this related to EQ? Remember the 4-branch model: 
perceive and express emotions, use emotions in thought, 
understand emotions, and regulate emotions in the self and 
others. One contrasting model that might be particularly 
important in predicting stress and coping is the Bar-On model 
that includes traits such as neuroticism. 
●
●
Recall that this model includes competencies such as intrapersonal 
skills (self-awareness and independence), interpersonal skills 
(developing empathy), adaptability (flexibly being able to solve 
problems), stress management, general moods (happiness and 
optimism), and traits such as extroversion or neuroticism. 
●
●
Just as there might be variability in the autonomic nervous 
system functioning, there’s also variability in EQ. In fact, the 
mechanism through which we can improve our EQ might come 
through modifications of our stress response systems. You’ll 
learn to be less reactive, so you’re able to manage your emotions 
more effectively.

Moïra Mikolajczak, Clémentine Menil, and Olivier Luminet showed 
that individuals high in trait EQ showed a smaller cortisol response 
to an experimental stressor: having to give a public speech. 
Furthermore, the effect held up with the big five personality 
factors controlled, suggesting that trait EQ was uniquely predictive 
of one component of the physiologic stress response.
●
●
To measure stress, we can use self-report questionnaires. We can 
also use performance tasks, in which we engineer a situation and 
see how robust of a stress response an individual has. We can also 
use physiological measures to examine the heart, blood pressure, 
cortisol, or salivary alpha amylase as well as indirect measures, for 
example, of epinephrine from our sympathetic nervous system. 
●
●
The questionnaire that’s most commonly used to measure stress 
is the Perceived Stress Scale, which asks you about events that 
might have occurred in the past month. 
●
●
The commonly used performance task is the Trier Social Stress 
Test, in which you’re told in a laboratory setting that you need 
to give a public speech. You’re hooked up to basic physiologic 
equipment and then walk next door into a big lecture hall, in 
which there is a hostile audience that finds you boring and 
uninteresting. You are lecturing on something you know nothing 
about. The situation is being manipulated to measure the 
reactivity and intensity of the stress response. 
Meditation, a form of 
somatic quieting, can 
turn down the volume 
on your sympathetic 
nervous system.

Lecture 19 | Stress Management

●
●
In a clinical setting, stress assessments are conducted through 
an interview. There is a 5-step process. 
1.	 How often have you felt nervous or stressed out in the past 
month? 
2.	 What’s been causing you to feel stressed out? And is there 
anything else? 
3.	 How long has this been going on? 
4.	 How has the stress been affecting you? How has it affected 
your relationships, or your performance at work? Are there any 
other effects? 
5.	 What have you been doing to cope with this stressful situation? 
How well has that been working for you? How can others help 
you get through this difficult time? What would be most helpful 
for someone to do right now?
●
●
Those 5 steps, which you can use for yourself or for someone 
else, are about frequency, cost, duration, impact, and coping. 
What works, what doesn’t, and how can we help? 
●
●
There are a few important assumptions about stress. First, just 
because you’re stressed doesn’t mean you’re not coping well. 
Second, some stress might be good. A little bit of fear, anxiety, 
or arousal gives you more focus, energy, and motivation, and 
developmentally, your experience of stress changes. 
Coping
●
●
There are 5 main coping tasks: decrease the harmful 
environmental conditions and increase prospects for recovery, 
tolerate adjustments to negative events, maintain a positive self-
image, maintain emotional equilibrium, and continue satisfactory 
relationships with others. 
●
●
Coping is usually divided into 2 primary categories: problem-
focused coping and emotion-focused coping. With problem-
focused coping, we try to directly address or change the stressor. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
165
Emotion-focused coping is often used when the stressor is 
simply not changeable, so no matter what you do, the stressor 
is still going to be there. The emotion-focused coping helps you 
feel less distressed. 
●
●
The most commonly used instrument for measuring coping is the 
Ways of Coping Scale from Susan Folkman and Richard Lazarus. 
It has 66 items, and it breaks coping into 8 different categories: 
confrontative, distancing, self-controlling, seeking social support, 
accepting responsibility, escape/avoidance, planful problem 
solving, and positive reappraisal. 
●
●
In terms of stress management, we need to develop the skills of 
accurate appraisals and optimal selection of coping strategies 
based on the controllability, resources, and importance of what’s 
going on. We need to select both cognitive and behavioral 
strategies from a long menu of possibilities, keeping in mind 
what Folkman tells us about the healthiest ways of coping. 
●
●
If we were to create a coping menu, what would it include? 
Cognitively, it might include distracting oneself, challenging 
habits of mind, rethinking appraisals, and seeking perspective. 
Behaviorally, it might include seeking social supports and 
engaging in positive activities, physical exercise, or a balanced 
diet of different kinds of activities. 
●
●
In looking at summaries of the resilience literature, it appears 
that resilient people have 3 characteristics: a staunch acceptance 
of reality, a deep belief that life is meaningful, and an ability to 
improvise. You need the skill of emotional agility: Recognize 
your patterns, label your thoughts and emotions, accept your 
thoughts and emotions, and act on your values. This is similar to 
many of the classic EQ abilities. 
●
●
In a systematic review by Judith Johnson and colleagues that 
looked at resilience to emotional distress in response to failure, 
the goal was to better understand people that do not experience 
significant emotional distress when they fail. 

Lecture 19 | Stress Management

●
●
In 46 relevant studies reported in 38 papers, the strongest 
support was found for the factors of high self-esteem, a more 
positive attributional style, and lower socially prescribed 
perfectionism. Weaker but still significant evidence was 
found for factors of lower trait reappraisal, lower self-oriented 
perfectionism, and higher emotional intelligence—so a weak 
relationship for EQ. 
●
●
In 3 additional studies, higher scores on traits of EQ tend to 
be more positively correlated with adaptive coping styles and 
negatively correlated with maladaptive coping styles. 
●
●
In the end, the relationship between EQ and stress may really 
depend on how you define it. Trait models are clearly related, 
and ability models do seem to overlap with some basic coping 
skills. It’s likely that learning to boost your EQ will have the added 
benefit of improving your ability to cope with stress.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Coping is typically divided into problem-focused and emotion-
focused categories. But what about when we are grappling with 
a stressor (such as a loss or an illness) to better understand it? 
Shouldn’t there be meaning-focused coping, too?
2.	 Do you think that millennials (young adults born after 1985) 
are more or less able to cope with stress when compared with 
their parents or grandparents? Does this have to do with their 
age or some larger generational effect?

Lecture 20
Emotion Regulation 
Disorders
D
espite advances in psychotherapies to treat conditions 
such as anxiety and depression, there remains a substantial 
percentage of patients who do not respond to treatment. 
One common characteristic between the often co-occurring 
disorders is heightened emotional experience—sometimes called 
neuroticism, emotional intensity, or high sensitivity. We see more—in 
terms of both intensity and duration—negative emotions or distress. 
This may reflect genetic or dispositional characteristics that 
heighten emotion responding, but this heightened arousal could 
also be due to other factors that are more amenable to change and 
reside specifically within the realm of emotion regulation.

Lecture 20 | Emotion Regulation Disorders
168
Distress Disorders
●
●
How do emotional problems arise? There are a number of 
different common features. First comes the category of 
experiential avoidance. The specific subtypes of avoidance 
include situational avoidance, the most common; cognitive 
avoidance, the “don’t worry about it” school of thought; 
protective 
avoidance, 
which 
includes 
perfectionism 
or 
overpreparation; somatic avoidance, where you’re trying to 
avoid a physical sensation within your body that might cause 
you anxiety; and substitution avoidance, where you’re doing 
something to pull your mind away from whatever’s scaring you. 
●
●
Why is avoidance bad? If you’re avoiding a situation, you may 
feel safe, but you’ve eliminated the opportunity for contextual 
learning and to find or build social support. Repetitive thought 
or perseveration is another shared feature of distress disorders. 
It might manifest in the form of pathological worry or depressive 
rumination. 
●
●
Other common features of distress disorders include response 
persistence, hostility or aggression, negative appraisals, emotional 
masking, and short-term focus.
●
●
Although psychotherapies usually target a disease, such as 
depression or anxiety, the push to look at distress disorders 
more generally encourages us to look for maladaptive skills and 
to correct them as needed, whatever the diagnosis may be. 
●
●
Keep in mind the primary model of EQ we’ve been using: the 
Salovey, Mayer, and Caruso integrative ability model, also called 
the 4-branch model. The 4 branches are the ability to perceive 
emotion, use emotion (harness for cognition), understand 
emotion, and regulate emotion in the self and others. 
●
●
Also keep in mind James Gross’s model of emotion and how 
it can be used to categorize regulation strategies. This model 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
169
involves situation selection, situation modification, attentional 
deployment, cognitive reappraisal, and response modification. 
●
●
What might go wrong with people who have a psychological 
disorder? They might not be very good at selecting a particular 
strategy given the needs at hand. They might have a lower ability 
to do emotion regulation skills effectively. Given where they’re 
starting, emotion regulation strategies might not work for them. 
There might also be some important neurobiological differences 
that make the task of emotion regulation more difficult. 
Anxiety Disorders
●
●
The family of anxiety disorders is the most common type of 
psychopathology. Biological and psychological vulnerabilities 
convert increased emotional reactivity and intentional bias toward 
perceived threats and global tendencies to see emotions as 
aversive. Individuals in this family engage in avoidant processing 
and behavior. 
●
●
David Barlow, one of the founding fathers of the field of 
anxiety studies, talks about triple vulnerabilities for people 
with anxiety. First, they have a biological tendency to be more 
reactive to situations. Second, they most likely have had early life 
experiences that teach them that the world is unpredictable and 
dangerous. Third, they probably have current life stressors and/
or learned experiences that push them further toward anxiety. 
●
●
Members of the anxiety disorder family include generalized 
anxiety disorder; social anxiety; specific phobias, such as fear 
of spiders or heights; post-traumatic stress disorder; obsessive 
compulsive disorder; and panic disorder. There is a disorder of 
emotional experiencing and maybe emotion regulation across all 
disorders in the anxiety family. 

Lecture 20 | Emotion Regulation Disorders
170
●
●
As an emotion regulation strategy, suppression doesn’t work in 
general but especially isn’t helpful for someone with an anxiety 
disorder. 
●
●
There are 3 key emotion regulation strategies for people with 
anxiety disorders. The first is the necessity to more effectively 
use cognitive reappraisal, or think about the stimulus in a way 
that reduces emotional intensity. Second, they need to stay away 
from suppression; it occurs too late in the model pathway to be 
effective. Third, they need to think about more ways to accept the 
distress that they’re having without trying to change or suppress it. 
●
●
What about links to EQ? Laura Summerfeldt and colleagues 
showed that trait EQ scores were low in 3 clinical anxiety groups, 
including panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and 
social anxiety, as measured by Reuven Bar-On’s EQ-i. They also 
found that although patients with social anxiety were low in 
interpersonal EQ, they also had low levels of intrapersonal EQ, 
suggesting a possible problem with internal mood regulation. 
Mood disorders
●
●
The next family of psychopathology is the mood disorders—
specifically major depression. Major depression is quite common, 
with a lifetime prevalence of about 20%. It’s qualitatively different 
than just feeling sad. You have to meet diagnostic criteria in 5 of 
9 hallmark symptoms, and it has to be present most of the day, 
nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks. 
●
●
Those hallmark symptoms include low or depressed mood, 
anhedonia (a difficulty in experiencing pleasure), disruptions in 
sleep, disruptions in appetite, low energy, low self-worth, and 
even thoughts about suicide. 
●
●
Depressed patients have the same triggers and same initial sad 
response as others, but they seem unable to repair their mood 
and often use strategies that extend the negative feelings, such 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
171
as rumination. They also use negative reappraisals instead of 
positive reappraisals, and this also worsens their mood. 
ERT
●
●
Emotion regulation therapy (ERT), developed by Douglas 
Mennin and David Fresco, is a relatively new therapy for distress 
disorders. This therapy rests in affective science, or more 
specifically, normative and disordered emotional processing 
and learning. It includes motivational mechanisms, regulatory 
mechanisms, and contextual learning consequences. 
●
●
ERT is designed to increase motivational, or mindful, awareness 
of emotional states; develop better regulatory capacities; and 
engage new contextual learning opportunities, or repertoires. It’s 
usually done in about 16 weekly sessions, in which the individuals 
build skills in the first half and then apply them in the second half 
during exposure exercises. 
●
●
With distress disorders, we also see motivational dysfunction, 
or conflicting pulls from reward and safety threat systems that 
Disruptions in 
sleep is one of 
the hallmark 
symptoms of 
major depression.

Lecture 20 | Emotion Regulation Disorders
172
are difficult to resolve. This may result from overreactivity to 
threat, insensitivity to rewards, or an accumulation of negative 
life events that have skewed perceptions of the world.
●
●
ERT is meant to help with motivational skills training. For 
example, Henny Westra, Hal Arkowitz, and David Dozois looked 
at traditional cognitive behavioral therapy as compared to 
cognitive behavioral therapy plus a motivational intervention for 
patients who have generalized anxiety disorder. They found that 
the combined condition that added a motivational component 
had superior outcomes. 
●
●
ERT early on uses self-monitoring and behavioral analysis. With 
behavioral analysis, you want to understand your triggers, 
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. 
●
●
A sample exercise is to catch yourself reacting, a self-monitoring 
exercise. Another exercise is a do-over, which is sort of a post-
mortem on a mistake that you have made where you think about 
alternative steps and the cognitive or behavioral rehearsals. 
●
●
Another exercise is regulatory skills training, which assumes that 
we can be trained to be better at regulating our emotions. It 
includes attending, or sustaining your focus and flexibly moving 
your attention from one thing to another; allowing, or turning 
toward to remain in contact with an emotion; distancing, or 
being able to step outside of a feeling or thought and realize 
that it’s different from you (decentering); and reframing, which is 
similar to the reappraisals that have been addressed in cognitive 
behavioral therapy. 
●
●
Examples of tools to build regulatory skills include mindfulness 
meditation, doing a 3-minute body scan, surfing the wave (where 
you just allow yourself to experience a feeling without trying 
to change it), and ABCD (which was addressed in lecture  8). 
Another strategy is mountain meditation, which is a way to 
distance yourself and give yourself some somatic quieting. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
173
●
●
If you’re interested in how to measure your regulatory skills or if 
you have deficits in regulatory skills, you can use the Difficulties in 
Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), which includes 36 statements 
of emotional competence rated on a 5-point scale from “almost 
never” to “almost always.” 
●
●
The DERS focuses on negative emotions and has 6 subscales that 
include lack of emotional awareness, lack of emotional clarity, 
nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in 
goal-directed behavior, impulse control difficulties, and limited 
access to effective emotion regulatory strategies. 
●
●
All of these scales highly correlate with one another, so usually 
you just see one score for the DERS. Scores on this questionnaire 
correlate highly with depression, anxiety, suicidality, eating 
disorders, and alcohol and drug use. 
●
●
The ERT focuses attention on personal values and our most 
cherished priorities. It encourages us to take exposures in life 
but to direct those exposures depending on what we value most. 
This is very similar to acceptance and commitment therapy. If 
you’re interested in more information on ERT, you can find it at 
www.emotionregulationtherapy.com. 
DBT
●
●
Another therapy that was designed specifically to address emotion 
dis-regulation is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). The DBT skills 
fit into approximately 6 different categories: mindfulness and 
acceptance, distress tolerance, self-soothing, doing the opposite, 
emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. 
●
●
They make the general assumption that difficulties with emotion 
regulation are a consequence of biosocial interactions. Biological 
sensitivity interacts with aversive and/or invalidating experiences 
during childhood or adolescence. This leads to neurobiological 
dysfunction and insufficient skills in emotion regulation as an adult. 

Lecture 20 | Emotion Regulation Disorders
174
●
●
DBT teaches emotion regulation but with more of a focus on 
regulation after an emotion has been generated. It distinguishes 
between experiential and expressive experiences and includes 
more on preexisting emotional vulnerabilities, both distal and 
proximate. 
●
●
Strategies for managing emotional vulnerability factors are 
thought to increase happiness and resilience and help individuals 
build a life worth living. These include scheduling daily pleasant 
events, building mastery, and coping ahead through rehearsal 
and imaginal exposure. There are also PLEASE skills: treating 
physical illness, balancing nutrition and eating, staying off non-
prescribed mood-altering drugs, getting sufficient but not 
excessive sleep, and getting adequate exercise. 
●
●
There are a number of strategies that fit in situation selection and 
modification category. These include stimulus control, listing the 
pros and cons to guide a course of action, and problem-solving 
skills. 
●
●
For attentional deployment, strategies include mindfulness 
skills of observing, describing, and participating in the moment 
without judgment. 
●
●
There are a few biological or experiential change strategies called 
TIP skills, which include opposite action, intense exercise if arousal 
is very high, and paced breathing and progressive relaxation with 
“willing hands” and a half smile to promote serenity. 
●
●
There have been hundreds of studies validating DBT. Marsha 
Linehan and others have shown that DBT reduces suicidal 
behaviors, reduces substance abuse, lowers depressive symptoms, 
improves treatment adherence, and reduces the number of 
psychiatric hospitalizations. DBT has also been successfully used 
for eating disorders.

Behavior Change and EQ
B
ehavior accounts for more than 50% of premature 
morbidity and mortality, but behavior change interventions 
remain limited in their availability and effectiveness. 
Emotions and EQ might help us understand key factors such as 
motivation, procrastination, willpower, and personal choice. This 
lecture will explore the notion of long-term behavior changes. You 
will be introduced to some of the statistics on change rates and 
then learn about some of the leading models of change. From 
those models, you will identify core concepts—such as motivation 
and self-regulation—and discover what they really mean.

177
Smoking
●
●
Smoking is the top contributor to premature mortality. In 1955, 
approximately 55% of men and 25% of women smoked. It wasn’t 
until the first U.S. surgeon general’s report in 1964 that we knew 
smoking was bad for you. Since that report came out, smoking 
has dropped to about 22% in men and 17% in women. However, 
those numbers have stayed essentially flat since the 1990s. 
Recent surveys show though that nearly 70% of smokers would 
like to stop and 52.4% have tried to stop in the past year. 
●
●
It takes the average smoker 4 to 5 different attempts to quit 
smoking. If smokers try to quit cold turkey, using no drugs or 
nicotine patches, they have about a 7% success rate. If they use 
nicotine replacement and/or medications, they have about a 
30% success rate. There are now more ex-smokers in the United 
States than smokers. 
●
●
In 2007, Timothy Carmody published a comprehensive review of 
theories linking negative emotions to nicotine dependence and 
smoking cessation. He begins with the review of motivational 
mechanisms, with negative affect as a driver for first and 
continuing use. Next, he describes the role of emotion regulation, 
coping-skills deficits, depression, and anxiety sensitivity in 
explaining the relationship between negative emotions and 
smoking relapse—all very much in line with our EQ model. He 
concludes that although smoking cessation programs don’t 
explicitly address EQ, nearly all include some elements of 
emotion regulation: coping with cravings, managing stress, and 
dealing with anxiety or depression.
Obesity and Weight Loss
●
●
Much EQ-focused work has been done in the areas of obesity 
and weight loss, where it looks like emotion regulation may be 
a core, if not central, feature. How are we doing with nutrition, 
obesity, and weight loss?

Lecture 21 | Behavior Change and EQ

The old food pyramid is now gone. Instead, there is now 
something called Choose My Plate, which you can find at 
www.choosemyplate.gov. It is a graphic of a round plate with 
a cup sitting next to it that provides a visual of the proportions 
of fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins that you should be 
consuming with each meal. 
●
●
Essentially, half of your plate should be fruits and vegetables, with 
a quarter for protein and a quarter for grains. We should eat about 
3 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of fruit every day. That’s around 
2000 total calories for the average person. We’re supposed to 
limit simple carbohydrates, saturated fats, and sodium. 
●
●
We follow these recommendations only 2% of the time. And to 
count as a yes, you only had to be 70% compliant. The most 
commonly eaten vegetable is the potato—in the form of French 
fries or potato chips. Second is the tomato, in the form of 
ketchup or pizza or pasta sauce. Third is onions, and fourth is 
iceberg lettuce, which is mostly water.
Smoking is the 
top contributor to 
premature mortality.

●
We’re not doing too well with nutrition, but what about body 
weight? Body weight is typically measured with something 
called body mass index (BMI), which is simply your weight in 
kilograms divided by your height in meters squared. A normal 
BMI is between 20 and 25. Overweight is between 25 and 30, 
and obese is more than 30. 
●
●
An alternative to BMI is the waist-to-hip ratio, sometimes called 
the gut-to-butt ratio. You want it to be less than 0.95 for men 
and less than 0.80 for women. 
●
●
Currently, almost 70% of men and women over the age of 20 
are considered overweight or obese, with a BMI of more than 25. 
About 36% are considered obese, so they have a BMI of more 
than 30. The rates of number of overweight and obese people 
have been rising dramatically over the past few decades.
●
●
How well do dieting programs work? There’s often a frustrating 
yo-yo pattern. You might lose a few pounds, but then you gain 
it back. You lose it again, but you gain it back. In fact, no diets 
actually work that well. The average amount of weight loss 
across all different kinds of diets is about 8%. The only exception 
to this is with surgery, where individuals can lose rather dramatic 
amounts of weight. 
●
●
What about physical activity? The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention recommend 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 
minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as brisk 
walking, every week and muscle-strengthening activities that 
work all of your major muscle groups—legs, hips, back, abdomen, 
chest, shoulders, and arms—2 or more days a week. This is for 
adults of all ages. 
●
●
As of 2015, only about 1 in 5 adults meet these criteria, and 
less than 30% of high school students get even 60 minutes of 
physical activity per day. As with obesity, we’re not doing so well. 
Clearly, something is going on. 

Lecture 21 | Behavior Change and EQ

Keep in mind the biopsychosocial model. It’s clear that the data 
we’re seeing about health-related behaviors isn’t just about 
personal choice. It’s also about policies, public health, living in a 
toxic food environment, and chronic stress—many explanations. 
Emotion and Health-Related Behaviors
●
●
We need to consider the role of emotions in initiating negative 
behavioral choices and in maintaining those choices. We 
should also consider the role of emotions in promoting positive 
behavioral choices and in building motivation to change. 
●
●
In a 2015 paper by Enrique Fernández-Abascal published 
in Frontiers in Psychology, the research team looked at the 
Trait Meta-Mood Scale and a measure of EQ called the Trait 
Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire to see how they’re related 
to health and health-related behaviors in general. EQ more 
strongly predicted mental health compared to behavioral health, 
but particular EQ subscales—such as emotionality, repair of 
emotions, and self-control—predicted health-related behaviors, 
especially preventive, positive health behaviors.
●
●
The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test predicts 
the lower use of tobacco and alcohol in adolescents with a 
correlation of around −0.16 to −0.19. In another study, the MSCEIT 
predicts alcohol use in college men but not in college women, 
nor does it predict drug use. 
●
●
A 2016 study by Mirja Görlach and colleagues looked directly at 
the relationship between emotion suppression and overeating 
in normal-weight and obese patients. They found that while 
suppression was tied to overeating in both groups, the effect 
was particularly pronounced in obese patients, where a pattern 
of overeating had already been established. 
●
●
It could be hypothesized that one function of overeating was 
to serve as an attentional deployment tool. Food became a 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
181
way to suppress an emotional experience. It looks like emotions 
and even EQ do play a role, but we’ll need to drill down a bit to 
understand those relationships.
Goals
●
●
To understand motivation, you have to understand goals. A goal 
is a cognitive representation of a desired endpoint. You picture 
in your mind what you want to accomplish—in this case, maybe 
eating better or exercising more. 
●
●
When discussing emotion regulation, we discussed emotion 
responses as the endpoints—for example, being less reactive 
or less depressed. Here, we refer to behavioral outcomes as 
the endpoints, but emotions are still important mediators that 
influence success. 
●
●
We will have superordinate goals, such as “I want to be healthy”; 
intermediate goals, such as “I want to exercise more”; and 
subordinate goals, such as “I want to eat fewer calories and 

Lecture 21 | Behavior Change and EQ
182
saturated fats.” Each level may evoke emotions, sometimes of 
different intensities or even different valences.
●
●
It is important to set realistic, SMART goals—goals that are 
specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely.
Motivation and Self-Regulation
●
●
Motivation is the activation of goal-directed behavior. It may be 
intrinsic, coming from inside yourself, or extrinsic, coming from 
outside sources. 
●
●
There are 3 key components that determine motivation. 
›
›
Importance/value. If you see your behavior change as 
important, that means you’ll have more motivation to do it. We 
tend to forget what our goals and values are because we get so 
busy, but we need to keep these ideas fresh and in the front of 
our mind. 
››
Self-efficacy. This is the belief that one is capable of performing 
in a certain manner to attain certain goals. People with high self-
efficacy are more likely to view difficult tasks as something to be 
mastered rather than something to be avoided. High self-efficacy 
predicts smoking cessation, physical exercise, dieting, condom 
use, dental hygiene, seatbelt use, and breast self-examination.
›
›
Social context. The first part of social context is your social 
support network, or the social circles in which you find 
yourself. Health-related behaviors are highly influenced by 
the people around us. The second part of social context is the 
social environment that we have around us. This isn’t entirely 
in our control, but we engineer our environment to remove 
temptations or triggers whenever possible. This is a skill called 
stimulus control. 
●
●
What do you need to change? In addition to having goals and 
motivation, you need core skills, especially self-regulation, and an 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
183
achievable action plan. Also think about support and environmental 
help. You don’t have to do this completely on your own. 
●
●
To be a good self-regulator, you need to start with a goal and 
have the capacity for self-observation, which involves gathering 
data about yourself. You also need self-evaluation. What ruler are 
you going to use to measure your success or performance? You 
also need self-reaction. What are your strategies to control your 
behavior? Are there rewards or punishments? Negative emotions 
have a pernicious ability to act on all of these elements of self-
regulation. 
●
●
To better improve our self-regulatory skills, we need reasonable 
goals as a starting point, followed by a review of our motivational 
drives. To beef up our self-regulatory capacity, we need to put 
some self-monitoring in place. To do that, we not only need a 
plan, but we also need heightened but nonjudgmental self-
awareness. 
“I want to eat 
fewer calories and 
saturated fats” is 
an example of a 
subordinate goal.

Lecture 21 | Behavior Change and EQ
184
Action Planning
●
●
To set up an action plan, you first need SMART goals, followed 
by obtaining the necessary resources, such as supplemental 
tools, medications, and gym memberships. Next, you create the 
detailed plan with steps.
●
●
Some of the elements of a good action plan include establishing 
a start date, sharing your plans with others in your social 
circle, instituting regular assessments and reevaluation dates, 
anticipating obstacles, expecting setbacks and lapses, and using 
regular consultations to adapt your plan with yourself or with 
others. You can also add implementation intentions, which link 
situations to specific goal-directed behaviors. 
●
●
You will mess up. You want to prevent the abstinence violation 
effect, where you give yourself a great deal of harsh criticism. 
You want to reframe slips or lapses as something that normally 
happens and frame them as an opportunity to learn and grow.
●
●
From a cognitive behavioral theory perspective, you want to 
do a behavioral analysis. A slip happened, learn from it, use 
the ABCDs—antecedents, behaviors, consequences, and if 
necessary, disputes—to help move forward. 
●
●
Don’t forget about positive appraisals. It’s not just about 
regulating the negative; it might be about generating positive 
emotions to help you manage stress.

Lecture 22
Chronic Disease and EQ
B
y 2020, the number of Americans living with a chronic 
disease is expected to reach 157 million, but many important 
opportunities for chronic disease management are missed. 
Emotions play a key role in accepting and responding to a medical 
diagnosis, and EQ skills could potentially improve and prolong life. In 
this lecture, you will learn about the epidemiology of chronic disease 
and the role of emotions as both a contributing cause and a possible 
intervention. You will also learn about 2 common but quite different 
chronic diseases—alcohol use disorder and cardiovascular disease—
and discover both research and interventions using EQ concepts.

Chronic Disease
●
●
The leading causes of morbidity and mortality have shifted 
dramatically over the past 100 years, from acute infectious illness, 
such as pneumonia, typhoid, and influenza, to chronic diseases, 
such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and lung disease. 
●
●
These new causes of morbidity and mortality all have deep social 
and behavioral roots, such as smoking, diet, exercise, stress, and 
the excessive use of alcohol and drugs. Fortunately, there are often 
early warning signs, and we know a great deal about risk factors, 
such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and tobacco use. 
●
●
To take advantage of our growing medical knowledge, we have 
to be emotionally prepared. We need regular screening tests, and 
we need to monitor our diets, get more exercise, be healthier—
the list goes on and on. 
●
●
But we are not that great at health-related behaviors, including 
medical adherence. We’re even worse when it comes to 
accepting a diagnosis and doing what we need to do to slow the 
advancement of a chronic disease. One family of interventions 
that falls into the EQ or emotion regulation category could help. 
●
●
The EQ literature suggests a number of possible pathways 
linking EQ and physical health. First, EQ facilitates positive health 
practices. In particular, high-EQ individuals are more likely to 
maintain proactive self-care practices, such as regular exercise, 
healthy diet, and safe sex. 
●
●
These practices require the capacity for delayed gratification 
and strong executive functioning over the limbic system—better 
known as self-regulation. This should similarly affect help-seeking 
behaviors and heath maintenance, such as keeping doctors’ 
appointments, getting vaccinations, and taking medications. 
●
●
Second, research by Peter Salovey and colleagues suggest that 
the lower stress reactivity associated with EQ may be a potential 

Lecture 22 | Chronic Disease and EQ
188
mechanism linking emotional competence and functioning with 
health outcomes. By now, you’ve learned a great deal about 
the relationship between EQ and stress, including how emotion 
regulation skills can help us lower our reactivity. 
●
●
Third, EQ may work through richer coping resources and more 
adaptive coping behaviors. Recall Susan Folkman’s work with 
the Ways of Coping Scale and the superior outcomes seen with 
positive reappraisals and planful problem solving—2 strategies 
found in the repertoires of people with high EQ. Moreover, there 
is emerging evidence that high-EQ individuals have stronger 
social support networks and may therefore enjoy greater social 
support that can be relied on in times of stress or illness.
●
●
Two meta-analytic studies help prove the link between EQ 
and health. Nicola Schutte and colleagues found that EQ and 
physical health were correlated at about 0.22. Alexandra Martins 
and colleagues looked at studies of physical and psychosomatic, 
or mental, health. In 12 studies of physical health, the correlation 
with EQ was .27; in 16 studies of psychosomatic health, the 
average correlation was .33. 
●
●
The possible mediators that help us understand this linkage 
between EQ and health are greater use of proactive self-care 
practices, lowered stress reactivity, better self-regulation for 
health-related behaviors, fewer negative health-related behaviors, 
superior coping mechanisms, and better social supports.
●
●
As we consider the role of EQ in chronic disease, it is important 
to remember that these diseases often take a long time to 
develop and to progress to disability or death. This means that 
the emotional tasks and challenges will vary depending on where 
you fall on the disease trajectory. 
●
●
In the early stages, there’s often a sense of invulnerability or denial. 
People in this stage either have little emotional reaction or actively 
use suppression. As evidence to the contrary accumulates, we are 
then forced to make both cognitive and emotional changes. We 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
189
must change our self-concept. We are no longer a healthy person; 
we have a new identity, a new group to which we belong.
●
●
This may evoke a host of feelings that are best experienced 
and understood—skills that are central to our EQ model. As 
the disease progresses, there are new stressors: You may lose 
energy and stamina, develop chronic pain, or gain weight or see 
other unwanted changes to your appearance. 
●
●
All of these events pose new emotional challenges. Will we seek 
social support? Will we use appropriately matched coping skills? 
We will be able to retain our sense of meaning and values if we 
no longer feel like ourselves? 
●
●
And when we get to the beginning of the end of life, how will we 
approach it? How will we honor and complete our relationships? 
Dying from a chronic disease often gives you time to say 
goodbye—to do the hard emotional work of letting go. When 
thinking about this trajectory, it’s easy to see how and why 
emotions might be so central. 
Gaining weight 
is one of many 
stressors as 
disease progresses.

Alcohol Use Disorder
●
●
Alcohol use disorder is the new term for alcohol addiction or 
alcoholism. The prevalence nationwide is around 7.2%. The rates 
tend to be double in men versus women, with about 10% in men 
and 5% in women. Approximately 3% of older adults meet full 
criteria for an alcohol use disorder. 
●
●
An alcohol use disorder is a problematic pattern of alcohol use 
leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. It’s based 
on criteria from the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Anyone meeting any 2 of the 
11 criteria during the same 12-month period receives a diagnosis of 
alcohol use disorder. The severity of the disorder—mild, moderate, 
or severe—is based on the number of criteria met. 
1.	 Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period 
than was intended.
2.	 There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down 
or control alcohol use.
3.	 A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain 
alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects.
4.	 Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol, is present. 
5.	 Recurrent alcohol use results in a failure to fulfill major role 
obligations at work, school, or home.
6.	 There is continued alcohol use despite having persistent 
or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or 
exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.
7.	 Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are 
given up or reduced because of alcohol use.
8.	 There is recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is 
physically hazardous.
9.	 Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a 
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that 
is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.
10.	There is the development of tolerance; you need more and 
more alcohol to have the same effect. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
191
11.	 There is withdrawal. If you suddenly stop drinking, you’ll have 
perhaps severe physiologic symptoms that could include 
seizures or even death.
●
●
To meet diagnostic criteria for an alcohol use disorder, you 
need 2 to 3 symptoms for a mild disorder, 4 to 5 for a moderate 
disorder, and 6 or more for a severe disorder.
●
●
With treatment, about 70% of people with an alcohol use 
disorder can drink less, but relapse is common, around 90%. 
Outcomes hinge on many different factors, including income or 
resources for treatment, having social supports that don’t drink 
or drink very little, and a willingness to make sometimes-drastic 
lifestyle changes.
●
●
On average, alcoholism reduces life expectancy by 10 to 12 
years. Medical complications include hypertension, stroke, 
cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, and an increase in certain 
kinds of cancer. But alcohol use disorder doesn’t just affect the 
person drinking; it can have devastating effects on significant 
others, family, and friends. 
●
●
In general, we can divide treatment for alcohol use disorder into 
3 phases. 
An alcohol use 
disorder is a 
problematic pattern 
of alcohol use leading 
to clinically significant 
impairment or distress.

Lecture 22 | Chronic Disease and EQ
192
›
›
Detoxification. We want an individual to be able to safely 
withdraw from alcohol. 
›
›
Recovery. A lot of emotion regulation training is necessary as 
the individual learns how to live his or her life without use of the 
substance. 
›
›
Relapse prevention. The individual could be sober for a month 
or more. How is he or she going to go back into the real world 
and not have a relapse? 
●
●
The most commonly used forms of treatment for substance 
use disorders are the 12-step program, or AA, which involves 
peer-to-peer group counseling sessions that are free. Another 
common treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy. Another one 
is mindfulness-based relapse prevention, developed by Alan 
Marlatt and Sarah Bowen, which is similar to third-wave therapies, 
such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or acceptance and 
commitment therapy.
Cardiovascular Disease
●
●
Hostility, especially cynical hostility in men, is associated with 
having a first heart attack. The damage that hostility causes 
begins early and usually takes decades to really matter. But there 
is something we can do about it. If you or your loved one might 
be in the top quintile of people who are angry, there is hope. 
Personalities don’t change, but we can learn to better manage 
our emotions.
●
●
The first study to demonstrate this was the Recurrent Coronary 
Prevention Project published by Meyer Friedman in the American 
Heart Journal in 1986. It was a 4.5-year randomized, controlled 
trial of more than a thousand men who had just had a myocardial 
infarction. 
●
●
Friedman compared 3 different types of treatment: usual care, 
generic group counseling, and a type-A modification group. In the 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
193
type-A group, they taught anger management skills and somatic 
quieting and engineered exposures to practice those calming skills. 
●
●
In the usual-care group, cardiac recurrences occurred at 28.2% 
over 4.5 years. In the generic group, there was a 21.2% recurrence 
of cardiac events, and in the type-A group, recurrence was only 
12.9%. 
●
●
A study published by James Blumenthal in the Archives of 
Internal Medicine in 1997 was a randomized, controlled trial of 
107 patients with ischemic heart disease treated with 4 months 
of exercise versus stress management versus usual care. 
Researchers analyzed further cardiac events at a 3-year follow-
up. There were further cardiac events in 21% of the exercise 
group and in 30% of the usual-care group, but in only 9% of the 
stress management group. 
●
●
In 2010, Mats Gulliksson published a randomized, controlled trial 
of 362 patients with chronic heart disease. He followed them for 
94 months. There were 5 key components in his intervention 
that spread over 22-hour groups: education, self-monitoring, 
skills training, cognitive restructuring, and spiritual development. 
He found that the adapted cognitive behavioral therapy group 
had 41% lower rates of both fatal and nonfatal heart events, 45% 
fewer recurrent heart attacks, and a significantly lower rate of 
death than patients in the traditional-care group. 
●
●
It seems that many of our usual tools, especially those in 
cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management categories, 
are effective in treating cardiovascular disease and reducing 
cardiac events. While cognitive behavioral therapy is more than 
just emotion regulation, it exerts much of its power by giving 
individuals tools to lower stress reactivity and to manage stress 
better once it does occur. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also 
help us with situation selection and modification, attentional 
deployment, and cognitive reappraisals. 

Lecture 22 | Chronic Disease and EQ

●
●
Cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the more common 
treatments for managing anger in yourself, particularly if you 
have cardiovascular disease, but there are a few key adaptations. 
There is heightened focus on 2 habits of mind—personalization 
and magnification—and more practice in calming skills, or 
somatic quieting.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Does low EQ increase the risk for developing a chemical 
addiction? How? Would training someone to have higher 
EQ help support his or her sobriety? Do groups such as AA 
influence EQ?
2.	 How does having a chronic disease affect your ability to 
perceive or express emotion, understand emotion, and 
manage emotion in yourself or others? Could it make your EQ 
skills stronger?

Lecture 23
Emotional Intelligence in 
Health Care
T
his lecture takes an inside look into the health-care system 
to see how and when emotions enter the picture and 
influence your health care. The lecture will focus on the 
fallible, emotional human beings that provide health care and 
the people who receive it. You will be introduced to some newer 
models of how health care might be provided and what your role 
might be, and you will discover how to get the most out of your 
medical encounters.

Lecture 23 | Emotional Intelligence in Health Care

Emotions in Medical Visits
●
●
In 2010, Sonal Arora and colleagues conducted a systematic 
review of 16 articles. In these papers, the EQ of doctors was 
assessed, along with other quality variables. Six of the 7 studies 
that looked at gender differences found that women doctors 
have higher EQs than male doctors. Higher EQ was reported to 
positively contribute to the doctor-patient relationship, increased 
empathy, teamwork and communication skills, and stress 
management, organizational commitment, and leadership—all 
broad and important effects.
●
●
A study of 277 nurses looked at the relationship between scores 
on the EQ-i and the use of different conflict-management 
strategies. It found that, on average, nurses prefer to avoid 
conflict, but if that doesn’t work, they try domination and 
assertion of authority. Those higher in EQ, however, are more 
likely to negotiate, compromise, or oblige requests. We don’t 
know the EQ of the patients or staff they were in conflict with, 
but remember that it is always a 2-way street. 
●
●
A fascinating and highly influential study of emotional clues 
during medical encounters was done by Wendy Levinson and 
published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In 
this study, she audiotaped medical visits of primary care patients 
versus surgical consultation visits. She and her team then listened 
to the tapes to find emotional clues. 
●
●
These clues offer a glimpse into the inner world of patients and 
create an opportunity for empathy and personal connection. 
By exploring the meaning of these clues for patients, physicians 
can deepen the therapeutic relationship and potentially enhance 
clinical outcomes. 
●
●
The stereotype of surgeons is that they are cold and aloof while 
primary care physicians are more interested in relationships even 
though they are overworked. Levinson found that greater than 
50% of all patient visits, in both categories, had some sort of 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
197
emotional clue that was brought up, and patients initiated those 
clues 70% of the time. While 38% of the surgeons responded to 
emotional clues, only 21% of the primary care doctors responded 
to emotional clues. Furthermore, she found that visits with 
missed cues actually took longer.
●
●
Nurses and physicians—especially primary care physicians—
have extraordinarily high levels of both occupational stress and 
burnout, and we now know that EQ plays a role. 
●
●
At the University of California, San Francisco, researchers 
gave medical residents the Schutte Self-Report Emotional 
Intelligence Test and measured their burnout with a variant of 
the Maslach Burnout Inventory every month. They also collected 
performance data from ratings of their faculty preceptors. They 
found that EQ was related to both burnout and performance. 
They also discovered that over the course of a year, their EQ 
actually increased. This might be a function of the EQ measure 
that was used, or it might reflect learning and growth from the 
intense year they had. 
The Chronic Care Model
●
●
Medical visits are hotbeds for emotions, and the EQ skills 
of providers matter. But the context in which health care is 
delivered—the structures or mandated processes—are also 
important, as they give us our choices. Are there any indications 
that a new paradigm is taking hold?
●
●
The Chronic Care Model is an interesting model specifically 
developed for the collaborative management of chronic disease, 
a key feature of which is patient activation and support for 
self-management. The model has 6 components for integrated 
health-care delivery: organizational support, clinical information 
systems, delivery system design, decision support, self-
management support, and community resources. 

Lecture 23 | Emotional Intelligence in Health Care
198
●
●
According to David Barlow and colleagues, self-management 
is “the individual’s ability to manage the symptoms, treatment, 
physical and social consequences and lifestyle change inherent 
in living with a chronic condition.” This includes many of the skills 
and emotion regulation strategies that were covered in lecture 21 
on behavior change and lecture 22 on chronic disease. 
●
●
The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program, an impressive 
program of research from Kate Lorig at Stanford, is a workshop 
given 2.5 hours once a week for 6 weeks in community settings 
such as senior centers, churches, libraries, and hospitals. People 
with different chronic health problems attend together and are 
facilitated by 2 trained leaders, one or both of whom are non–
health professionals with chronic diseases themselves.
●
●
Topics covered include techniques to deal with problems such as 
frustration, fatigue, pain, and isolation; appropriate exercise for 
maintaining and improving strength, flexibility, and endurance; 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
199
appropriate use of medications; communicating effectively 
with family, friends, and health professionals; nutrition; decision 
making; and how to evaluate new treatments.
●
●
Each participant in the workshop receives a copy of the 
companion book, Living a Healthy Life with Chronic Conditions 
(fourth edition), and an audio relaxation CD. 
●
●
More than 1000 people with heart disease, lung disease, stroke, 
or arthritis participated in a randomized, controlled test of the 
program and were followed for up to 3 years. They looked for 
changes in health status, health-care utilization, self-efficacy, and 
self-management behaviors.
●
●
Subjects who participated in the program, when compared to 
those who did not, demonstrated significant improvements in 
exercise, cognitive symptom management, communication with 
physicians, self-reported general health, health distress, fatigue, 
disability, and social/role activities limitations. They also spent 
fewer days in the hospital, and there was a trend toward fewer 
outpatient visits and hospitalizations. 
●
●
The Chronic Care Model also includes shared decision making, 
which is the collaboration between patients and providers 
to come to an agreement about a health-care decision. It is 
especially useful when there is no clear “best” treatment option. 
The provider should first elicit your decision-making preferences 
and then clarify the decision at hand. Remember that the 
decision is yours. Your doctor may not agree, but he or she is 
only a consultant. 
●
●
A few studies completed at the University of California, San 
Francisco, and Stanford found that shared decision making is rare 
and that most doctors don’t know how to do it. They developed 
a training program and have data that shared decision making 
works, but they don’t yet know whether shared decision making 
as they have taught it improves clinical outcomes. There is a vast 
shared-decision-making literature, and the jury is still mostly out.

Getting the Most out of a Medical Visit
●
●
To get the most out of a medical visit:
›
›
Prepare. 
›
›
Make sure the office knows a little about your reason for 
setting up an appointment so that they can schedule a proper 
amount of time. 
›
›
Decide on what your top few goals are before the visit and 
write them down. 
›
›
Make a list of all of your medications, herbal supplements, and 
over-the-counter products, or just bring them all in a bag to 
your appointment. 
›
›
Invite a friend or family member to come with you. 
›
›
Keep a journal of any worrisome symptoms, and be sure to 
write down any questions or concerns you have in advance—
and prioritize them.
●
●
During the visit:
›
›
Set an agenda at the beginning.
›
›
Ask questions; don’t be afraid.
›
›
Before you end, repeat back your understanding of the 
diagnosis and plan.
›
›
Get follow-up instructions.
›
›
Make sure you know how to reach out again if you have 
questions. 
●
●
Unfortunately, this good, practical advice is often not followed. 
This is partly because patients are worried, scared, and distracted 
and feel disempowered or intimidated. But that power is yours. 
The doctor holds the prescription pad and is the one that orders 
tests, but he or she works for you. Your feedback, satisfaction, 
and EQ skills in managing the emotions of your physician and 
health-care team matter. 
●
●
It is not your job to take care of your doctor or nurse, and 
don’t behave in a disingenuous or manipulative way, but think 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
201
about what emotions your doctor might be having and what 
strategies you might use to get the best performance out of him 
or her. You’d be surprised how rarely patients offer a word of 
appreciation or recognition that the doctor is overloaded and 
how effective they might be in strengthening your connection. 
●
●
The electronic health record is a relatively recent addition to most 
medical encounters—one that can greatly alter the emotional 
tone and opportunity for connection. It’s efficient and some 
say effective. It varies by practice, but for the most part, you’ve 
probably noticed that your doctor spends more time looking at a 
screen than looking at you. What can you do about this?
●
●
Take charge. Let your doctor know that you empathize with his or 
her predicament and are ready to find a flexible solution. Perhaps 
you can look at the computer screen together so that you’re 
involved in reviewing labs and notes. Fortunately, doctors are 
coming to better recognize the deep emotional impacts of having 
a disease. They want to know what matters to you and how.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Which group do you think tends to have higher EQ: doctors 
or nurses? Is this a function of their training, or do they self-
select into that profession?
2.	 Where do all of the emotions generated during work go at 
the end of the day? Consider a doctor or nurse who may 
see more than 20 patients per day. How can he or she be 
emotionally present with patients all day and then go home?

Lecture 24
The Future of Emotional 
Intelligence
I
n this final lecture, you will learn about exciting up-and-coming 
applications of EQ, new subtypes of intelligence, cutting-edge 
research, and new technological tools that are intended to make 
us more emotionally intelligent. This lecture looks ahead to see 
where EQ may be headed and the promise it holds for the future.

Lecture 24 | The Future of Emotional Intelligence
204
Technology Tools
●
●
Technology—in part a rapid and efficient but low-bandwidth 
form of communication—has the potential to impact the 
development and use of EQ. Jennifer Aaker from Stanford, a 
coauthor of The Dragonfly Effect, analyzed 72 studies performed 
on nearly 14,000 college students between 1979 and 2009 
and  found a sharp decline in empathy. Young adults have 
become desensitized to the suffering of others, given how much 
they see online on a daily basis.
●
●
When asked about Facebook and EQ, Daniel Goleman talks 
about weak links—virtual friends—and strong links—close friends. 
The worry is that Facebook provides enough weak links that we 
don’t bother to build stronger links. As with any tool, it depends 
on how you use it. If it becomes a tool to initiate more meaningful 
relationships, then use it. If it becomes a tool to catalyze a social 
movement, then use it. We shouldn’t blame the tool if we don’t 
fully realize its potential. The same could be said for a television 
or even a radio. 
●
●
We’ve all seen or experienced or maybe even perpetrated the 
infamous email flame, or the dysregulated expression of rage via 
email. There’s usually a trigger, and underneath all the verbiage 
and intensity is a message, but it’s too intense and probably has 
unintended consequences. These flames are particularly easy to 
do because there is not another person in front of you. The best 
strategy is to never write or send emails when angry. If that can’t 
be avoided, turn off your Wi-Fi connection and write whatever 
you need to write. Later, reread it before you turn your Wi-Fi 
back on. 
●
●
We’ve all misread the tone of emails and struggled with the 
expression and perception of emotion in emails. The simple 
solution is to stop sending email that has a necessary emotional 
component. Email is not for expression of emotions; it is for 
conveying basic factual information. If it is emotional, pick up the 
phone or use Skype or FaceTime. 

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
205
●
●
Recall the modal model of emotions: situation, attention, 
cognitive appraisal, and emotional response. Technology creates 
new triggers, new situations. This is neither good nor bad, but 
it does affect the scope of exposures that might trigger an 
emotion. For emotion regulation—situation selection or situation 
modification—we need to take control of when, where, and how 
technology is invited into our lives. 
●
●
From an attentional deployment perspective, we need to be very 
concerned about the level of distraction that children now have 
to deal with. Are we training a generation that can’t pay attention 
to something longer than a 3-minute YouTube clip? The mind 
needs to be trained, including attention. Are we handicapping 
ourselves and our children? 
●
●
Fortunately, social and emotional learning programs have taken 
off in schools. Maybe what children have lost via social media and 
technology can be replaced with social and emotional learning 
training—or maybe that training could incorporate electronic 
games or simulations to hook interests and fuel learning further. 
There’s really no data on social media, technology, and EQ, but 
it’s likely around the corner.
Maybe what

Virtual Reality
●
●
Virtual reality headsets can be very immersive and exciting. The 
goal is to shut out other sensory stimuli and replace them with 
a world created by the programmers. In psychotherapy, virtual 
reality is being used as a convenient way to deliver exposure 
therapy. 
●
●
For example, a spider-phobic person puts on a virtual reality 
headset and slowly views increasingly more realistic-looking 
spiders while practicing distress-tolerance skills and somatic 
quieting. He or she hasn’t left the comfort of home but is actively 
working on improving his or her emotion regulation skills. 
●
●
In a study by Barbara Rothbaum in the Journal of Clinical  and 
Counseling Psychology, group of patients with an intense fear of 
flying were recruited. One-third got virtual reality, one-third got 
standard exposure therapy, and one-third got nothing. Both the 
virtual reality and standard treatment showed dramatic effects, 
and after a year, 93% of those groups had flown. 
The goal of virtual 
reality is to shut out 
other sensory stimuli 
and replace them 
with a world created 
by the programmers.

Boosting Your Emotional Intelligence
207
●
●
What does the future of virtual reality mean in terms of EQ—
the perception/expression, facilitation/use, understanding, and 
regulation of emotions? The range (and intensity) of potential 
situations or triggers will be exponentially increased—which 
could be either good or bad. The potential modifications to 
each situation are essentially endless, and this has tremendous 
implications for emotional regulation. 
●
●
In terms of teaching response modification, learning to 
upregulate or downregulate an emotion once it occurs, virtual 
reality has tremendous potential. It feels real, so it generates 
real physiologic responses, which you then have an opportunity 
to try to control—via suppression, somatic quieting, or another 
strategy. 
Affectiva
●
●
Affectiva, an MIT spin-off located in Waltham, Massachusetts, 
builds a variety of products that harnesses the 2 main 
characteristics 
of 
facial 
expressions—robustness 
and 
universality—to measure and analyze emotional responses. 
●
●
Affectiva’s cofounder and CEO tells us that emotion is missing 
from all of our digital devices and needs to be added. Her 
company has added an emotion artificial intelligence platform 
that captures emotion data points from users and then uses 
emotion analytics to derive insights as well as design real-time 
experiences that adapt to human emotion in the moment. 
●

Their devices use computer vision to assess facial expression 
and read emotion using machine learning. For instance, they 
use your webcam on your laptop to watch you as you watch 
an advertisement or video. They can measure your emotional 
response to grade the effectiveness of the commercial. They will 
eventually automatically adjust what you are watching until it 
evokes the desired emotional effect.

In the clinical realm, you can allow your smartphone camera 
to watch you and they claim to be able to assess changes in 
depression, pain, and anxiety between your physician visits. 
Alternatively, they have invented a device—at $2000—that is 
sort of like a Fitbit for your mood. It uses psychophysiologic 
measures to assess your emotions. 
Smartphone Apps
●
●
A group at the University of California, San Francisco, funded 
by the California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine is 
collaborating with computer science and medical colleagues 
at UC–Berkeley and UC–Davis to create a smartphone app 
that assesses your response to changes in your antidepressant 
medication. 
They 
use 
daily 
photographic-affect-meter 
assessments and also collect GPS data on movement. 
●
●
Based on algorithms derived from David Mohr’s group at 
Northwestern, they can look for telltale signs of improving or 
worsening depression by analyzing where you go, when you go, 
and how long you stay. They look at overall activity levels and any 
deviations from your usual patterns. Ultimately, they are trying to 
provide more frequent, higher-quality feedback to primary care 
physicians so that they can best adjust patients’ antidepressants. 
Smart Architecture
●
●
What if our environments could perceive our emotions and 
respond accordingly? Picture this seemingly futuristic scenario: 
After a stressful day at work, you enter your house and walk 
toward the kitchen. Your emotionally intelligent home is sensing 
your heart rate and body temperature. Your home security 
cameras are zooming in on your face and analyzing your facial 
expression. The house also notes how heavy your steps are and 
how tense your posture seems.

●
●
Before you reach the kitchen, the lights have been adjusted with 
a touch of rose to warm things up, the air circulation system 
is now adding lavender vapor to add a relaxing aroma to the 
air, soft music switches on, and a cup of chamomile tea starts 
brewing. As you sip your tea, your high-EQ home re-senses your 
mood to see if its interventions have done the trick. 
●
●
A prototype of this house has been created by Antonio Fernández-
Caballero and his team and is called smart architecture. It 
includes 3 key features: emotion detection, emotion regulation, 
and emotion feedback control. The technology is still quite new 
and still evolving, but the applications are almost endless. 
New Types of Intelligences
●
●
In this course, you have learned about several different types of 
intelligences: IQ, EQ, and even social intelligence. Each theory 
offers an important lens through which to view the world. Each 
also potentially offers interventions to help those who might 
need to develop more social or emotional skills. 
A smartphone app 
is being developed 
that assesses your 
response to changes 
in your antidepressant 
medication.

Lecture 24 | The Future of Emotional Intelligence
210
●
●
A few new types of intelligences are on the horizon, including 
spiritual intelligence and ecological intelligence. The term 
“spiritual intelligence” was coined by Danah Zohar and relies on 
the concept of spirituality being distinct from religiosity. Twelve 
principles underlie spiritual intelligence, including self-awareness, 
spontaneity, compassion, humility, tendency to ask fundamental 
“why” questions, and having a sense of vocation.
●
●
Robert Emmons defines spiritual intelligence as “the adaptive 
use of spiritual information to facilitate everyday problem solving 
and goal attainment.” He originally proposed 5 components of 
spiritual intelligence: the capacity to transcend the physical 
and material, the ability to experience heightened states of 
consciousness, ability to sanctify everyday experience, ability to 
utilize spiritual resources to solve problems, and capacity to be 
virtuous (which was later dropped).
●
●
All spiritual intelligence assessment measures are self-report so 
are vulnerable to faking. Scales include the SQ21 and the Scale 
for Spiritual Intelligence for use in adolescents. 
●
●
Ecological intelligence was described in a 2009 book by Daniel 
Goleman, who discloses the hidden environmental consequences 
of what we make and buy and how “radical transparency” will 
enable consumers to make smarter purchases. 
●
●
It’s a recognition that our culture pushes us to mindlessly buy 
and acquire without considering the impacts this might have 
on the environment—and we do all this purchasing without 
acknowledging the effects it will or will not have on our mood. 
●
●
We don’t know whether ecological intelligence is really an 
intelligence or a set of abilities. Nonetheless, Goleman makes a 
compelling argument for heightened awareness and sensitivity 
for how we use our purchasing power and how companies 
should be more transparent about how and where their goods 
are manufactured.

New Research
●
●
Exciting new research is being done at Stanford in the lab of 
James Gross, who gave us the modal model of emotions. They’re 
using functional MRIs to look at measures of brain activation in 
different brain areas when an individual is engaged in the process 
of cognitive reappraisal. They believe that it involves executive 
functioning, so they’re looking in the frontal lobes and specifically 
the prefrontal cortex, but they’re particularly interested in the 
communication between the frontal lobes and the limbic system.
●
●
Another example of a new study area is the coherence of 
emotions. Emotions involve multiple response systems, and we 
have claimed that these responses are organized or coherent. 
Surprisingly few studies have tested this core hypothesis of the 
modal model, and those that have done so yielded mixed results. 
Our culture pushes 
us to mindlessly buy 
and acquire without 
considering the impacts 
this might have on the 
environment.

Lecture 24 | The Future of Emotional Intelligence
212
●
●
In this new project, researchers at Gross’s lab are obtaining 
continuous measures of emotional experience, expression, and 
physiology and examining the conditions under which response 
coherence is evident. It has implications for helping us better 
understand when we’re in complex, mixed states.

Questions to Consider
1.	 What’s the most disturbing part about machines/robots/
computers developing the capacity to read and respond to 
our emotions? What new problems might emerge?
2.	 Will the advancing science of emotions detract from the 
magic and mystery of emotions in the arts? Can we have 
both?
