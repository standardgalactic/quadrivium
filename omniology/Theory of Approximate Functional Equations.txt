Introduction
In 1940, an interesting talk presented by Stanislaw M. Ulam triggered the study of
stability problems for various functional equations. In his talk, Ulam discussed the
notion of the stability of mathematical theorems considered from a rather general
point of view: When is it true that by changing a little the hypotheses of a theorem,
one can still assert that the thesis of the theorem remains true or approximately true?
Particularly, for every general functional equation one can ask the following question:
when is it true that the solution of an equation differing slightly from a given one must
of necessity be close to the solution of the given equation? Indeed, Ulam proposed the
following problem:
Given a group G1, a metric group G2 with the metric d(·, ·) and a positive number ε,
does there exist δ > 0 such that, if a mapping f : G1 →G2 satisﬁes
d( f(xy), f(x)f(y)) ≤δ
for all x, y ∈G1, then a homomorphism h : G1 →G2 exists with
d( f(x), h(x)) ≤ε
for all x ∈G1? If the problem accepts a solution, the equation is said to be stable (see
[90]).
In trying to solve problems of this kind, most authors have considered homomor-
phisms between different groups or vector spaces, rather than automorphisms, for
perturbations.
In the following year, 1941, Donald H. Hyers [6] was able to give a partial solution
to Ulam’s question that was the ﬁrst signiﬁcant breakthrough and step toward more
solutions in this area. He considered the case of approximately additive mappings
between Banach spaces and proved the following results.
Theorem 1.0.1. Let E1 and E2 be Banach spaces and let f : E1 −→E2 satisﬁes the
following condition: there is a constant ϵ ≥0 such that
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤ϵ
for all x, y ∈E1. Then the limit h(x) = lim
n→∞
f(2nx)
2n
exists for all x ∈E1 and h : E1 →
E2 is a unique linear transformation such that
∥f(x) −h(x)∥≤ϵ.

Theorem 1.0.2. If under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.0.1 f(tx) is continuous in
t ∈R for each x ∈E1, then the mapping h is R-linear.
The term Hyers-Ulam stability originates from this historical background. The
method that was provided by Hyers is called the direct method, and produces the
additive mapping h. The direct method is the most important and powerful tool for
studying the stability of various functional equations.
The theorem of Hyers was generalized by Aoki [1] for additive mappings by
considering an unbounded Cauchy difference.
Theorem 1.0.3 (Aoki [1]). If f(x) is an approximately linear transformation from
E into E′, ie,
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤K0(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p),
for all x, y ∈E1,
where K0 ≥0 and 0 ≤p < 1, then there is a unique linear transformation Q(x) near
f(x), ie, there exists K ≥0 such that
∥f(x) −Q(x)∥≤K∥x∥p.
In 1978, Themistocles M. Rassias [8] succeeded in extending the result of Hyers’s
theorem by weakening the condition for the Cauchy difference.
Theorem 1.0.4. Let E1 and E2 be two Banach spaces and let f : E1 −→E2 be
a mapping such that f(tx) is continuous in t ∈R for each ﬁxed x. Assume that there
exists ε > 0 and 0 ≤p < 1 such that
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤ε(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p),
for all x, y ∈E1.
Then there exists a unique linear mapping T : E1 →E2 such that
∥f(x) −T(x)∥≤
2ε
2 −2p ∥x∥p,
for all x ∈E1.
The stability phenomenon that was presented by Th.M. Rassias is called the
generalized Hyers-Ulam stability. This terminology may also be applied to the cases
of other functional equations. Since then, a large number of papers have been
published in connection with various generalizations of Ulam’s problem and Hyers’s
theorem.
There are cases in which each approximate mapping is actually a true mapping.
In such cases, we say that the functional equation is hyperstable. Indeed, a functional
equation is hyperstable if every solution satisfying the equation approximately is an
exact solution of it. For the history and various aspects of this theory, we refer the
reader to [2–5].
The concept of Hyers-Ulam stability is quite signiﬁcant in realistic problems in
numerical analysis, biology, and economics. This concept actually means that if one
is studying a Hyers-Ulam stable system, then one does not have to reach the exact
solution (which usually is quite difﬁcult or time consuming). Hyers-Ulam stability

Introduction

guarantees that there is a close exact solution. This is quite useful in many applications,
eg, numerical analysis, optimization, biology, and economics, etc., where ﬁnding the
exact solution is quite difﬁcult. It also helps, if the stochastic effects are small, to use a
deterministic model to approximate a stochastic one.
The notion of stability arose naturally in problems of mechanics. There it involves,
mathematically speaking, the continuity of the solution of a problem in its dependence
on initials parameters. This continuity may be deﬁned in various ways. Often it is
sufﬁcient to prove the boundedness of the solutions for arbitrarily long times, eg, the
boundedness of the distance between the point representing the system at any time for
the initial point, etc. Needless to say, problems of stability occur in other branches of
physics and, in a way, also even in pure mathematics.
Unfortunately, there are no books completely dealing with the stability problem of
functional equations in Banach algebras, inner product spaces, and amenable groups.
Moreover, in most stability theorems for functional equations, the completeness of the
target space of the unknown functions contained in the equation is assumed. Recently,
the question of whether the stability of a functional equation implies this completeness
has been investigated by several authors. In this book, we are going to deal with the
above-mentioned developments in the theory of approximate functional equations.
This book introduces the latest and new results on the following topics:
(1) approximate Cauchy functional equations and completeness;
(2) stability of binary, ternary, and foursome mixtures of functional equations;
(3) approximations of homomorphisms and derivations in different Banach algebras;
(4) stability of functional equations in inner product spaces; and
(5) amenability of groups (semigroups) and the stability of functional equations.

2.1
Theorem of Hyers
The ﬁrst result on the stability of functional equations was given in 1941 by Hyers [6].
He was able to give a partial solution to Ulam’s question that was the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
breakthrough and step toward more solutions in this area.
The solutions of the Cauchy (additive) functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)
have been investigated for many spaces. Any solution f(x) of this equation will be
called a linear transformation. To make the statement of the problem precise, let E and
E′ be Banach spaces and let δ be a positive number. A linear transformation f(x) of E
into E′ will be called a δ-linear transformation if
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤δ
for all x and y in E. Then the problem may be stated as follows. Does there exist for
each ε > 0 a δ > 0 such that, to each δ-linear transformation f(x) of E into E′ there
corresponds a linear transformation l(x) of E into E′ satisfying the inequality
∥f(x) −l(x)∥≤ε
for all x in E? Hyers answered this question in the afﬁrmative, and showed that δ
may be taken equal to ε. This is clearly a best result, since the transformation f(x) =
L(x)+c where L(x) is linear and c < ε is evidently an ε-linear transformation for which
l(x) = L(x).
Theorem 2.1.1 (Hyers [6]). Let E and E′ be Banach spaces and let f : E →E′ be
a δ-linear transformation. Then the limit l(x) = lim
n→∞
f(2nx)
2n
exists for all x ∈E and
l : E →E′ is the only linear transformation such that
∥f(x) −l(x)∥≤ε
for all x ∈E

Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
Proof. For any x in E the inequality ∥f(2x) −2f(x)∥< δ is obvious from the
deﬁnition of δ-linear transformations. On replacing x by x/2 in this inequality and
dividing by 2 we see that ∥(1/2)f(x)−f(x/2)∥< δ/2 for all x in E. Make the induction
assumption
∥2−nf(x) −f(2−nx)∥< δ(1 −2−n).
(2.1)
On the basis of the last two inequalities, we ﬁnd that
∥2−1f(2−nx) −f(2−n−1x)∥< δ/2
and
∥2−n−1f(x) −2−1f(2−nx)∥< δ(1/2 −2−n−1).
Hence,
∥2−n−1f(x) −f(2−n−1x)∥< δ(1 −2−n−1).
Therefore, since the induction assumption [2.1] is known to be true for n = 1, it is true
for all positive integers n and all x ∈E.
Put qn(x) = f(2nx)/2n, where n is a positive integer and x is in E. Then
qm(x) −qn(x) = f(2mx)
2m
−f(2nx)
2n
= f(2m−n · 2nx) −2m−nf(2nx)
2m
.
Therefore, if m < n we can apply inequality [2.1] and write
∥qm(x) −qn(x)∥< δ(1 −2m−n)/2m
for all x ∈E. Hence, {qn(x)} is a Cauchy sequence for each x ∈E, and since E is
complete, there exists a limit function l(x) = limn→∞qn(x). Let x and y be any two
points of E. Since f(x) is δ-linear,
∥f(2nx + 2ny) −f(2nx) −f(2ny)∥≤δ
for all positive integers n. On dividing by 2n and letting n approach inﬁnity, we see that
l(x + y) = l(x) + l(y).
If we replace x by 2nx in the inequality [2.1], we ﬁnd that
∥f(2nx)/2n −f(x)∥≤δ(1 −2−n).
Hence, in the limit, ∥l(x) −f(x)∥≤δ.

Suppose that there was another linear transformation L(x) satisfying the inequality
∥L(x) −f(x)∥≤δ for all x ∈E, and such that l(y) ̸= L(y) for some point y of E.
For any integer n > 2δ/∥l(y) −L(y)∥, it is obvious that ∥l(ny) −L(ny)∥> 2δ, which
contradicts the inequalities ∥L(ny) −f(ny)∥≤δ and ∥l(ny) −f(ny)∥≤δ. Hence, l(x)
is the unique linear solution of the inequality ∥l(x) −f(x)∥≤δ.
Next the character of the linear transformation l(x) when continuity restrictions are
placed on the transformation f(x) is investigated.
Theorem 2.1.2 (Hyers [6]). If under the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1.1 we sup-
pose that f(x) is continuous at a single point y of E, then l(x) is continuous
everywhere in E.
Proof. Assume, contrary to the theorem, that the linear transformation l(x) is not
continuous. Then there exists an integer k and a sequence of points xn of E converging
to zero such that ∥I(xn)∥> l/k for all positive integers n. Let m be an integer greater
than 3kδ. Then
∥l(mxn + y) −l(y)∥= ∥l(mxn)∥> 3δ.
On the other hand,
∥l(mxn + y) −l(y)∥≤∥l(mxn + y) −f(mxn + y)∥
+ ∥f(mxn + y) −f( y)∥+ ∥f(y) −l(y)∥< 3δ
for sufﬁciently large n, since limn→∞f(mxn+y) = f(y). This contradiction establishes
the theorem.
Corollary 2.1.3 (Hyers [6]). If under the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1.1 we suppose
that for each x ∈E the function f(tx) is a continuous function of the real variable t for
t ∈R, then l(x) is homogeneous of degree one.
Proof. For ﬁxed x, f(tx) is a continuous δ-linear transformation of the real axis into
E′. By Theorems 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, l(tx) is continuous in t and hence, being linear, l(x)
is homogeneous of degree one.
In 1991, Baker [7] used the Banach ﬁxed point theorem to prove the Hyers-Ulam
stability for single variable functional equations.
Proposition 2.1.4 (Baker [7]). Suppose S is a nonempty set, φ : S →S, E is a
Banach space, λ is a scalar, |λ| < 1, δ > 0, and f : S →E such that
∥λf(φ(x)) −f(x)∥≤δ
for all x ∈S. Then there exists a unique h : S →E such that λh(φ(x)) = h(x) for all
x ∈S and
∥f(x) −h(x)∥≤δ(1 −|λ|)
for all x ∈S.
Theorem 2.1.5 (Baker [7]). Suppose (Y, ρ) is a complete metric space and T : Y →
Y is a contraction (for some λ ∈[0, 1), ρ(T(x), T(y)) < λρ(x, y) for all x, y ∈Y). Also

suppose that u ∈Y, δ > 0 and ρ(u, T(u)) < δ. Then there exists a unique p ∈Y such
that p = T(p). Moreover, ρ(u, p) < δ/(1 −λ).
Theorem 2.1.6 (Baker [7]). Suppose S is a nonempty set; (X, d) is a complete metric
space; φ : S →S, F : S × X →X, 0 ≤λ < 1; and
d(F(t, u), F(t, v)) ≤λd(u, v)
for all t ∈S and all u, v ∈S. Also suppose that g : S →X, δ > 0 and
d(g(t), F(t, g(φ(t)))) ≤δ
(2.2)
for all t ∈S. Then there is a unique function f : S →X such that
f(t) = F(t, f(φ(t)))
(2.3)
for all t ∈S and
d( f(t), g(t)) ≤δ/(1 −λ)
(2.4)
for all t ∈S.
Proof. Let Y = {a : S →X|sup{d(a(t), g(t))|t ∈S} < ∞}. For a, b ∈Y
deﬁne ρ(a, b) = sup{d(a(t), b(t))|t ∈S}. Then g ∈Y, ρ is a metric on Y, and
convergence with respect to ρ means uniform convergence on S with respect to d.
Moreover, the completeness of X with respect to d implies the completeness of Y with
respect to ρ.
For a ∈Y, deﬁne T(a) : S →X by
(T(a))(t) = F(t, a(φ(t)))
for all t ∈S. Then T maps Y into Y. If a, b ∈Y then for all t ∈S,
d((T(a))(t), (T(b))(t)) = d(F(t, a(φ(t))), F(t, b(φ(t))))
≤λd(a(φ(t)), b(φ(t)))
≤λρ(a ◦φ, b ◦φ)
≤λρ(a, b).
Thus,
ρ(T(a), T(b)) ≤λρ(a, b)
for all a, b ∈Y. But Eq. [2.2] means that ρ(g, T(g)) ≤δ. Hence, according to
Theorem 2.1.5, there is a unique f in Y such that f = T( f) and ρ(g, f) ≤δ/(1 −λ).
That is, Eqs. [2.3] and [2.4] hold.

Theorem of Themistocles M. Rassias
Theorem 2.2.1 (Th.M. Rassias [8]). Consider E1, E2 to be two Banach spaces, and let
f : E1 →E2 be a mapping such that f(tx) is continuous in t for each ﬁxed x. Assume
that there exists θ ≥0 and 0 ≤p < 1 such that
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥
∥x∥p + ∥y∥p
≤θ
for any x, y ∈E1.
Then there exists a unique linear mapping T : E1 →E2 such that
∥f(x) −T(x)∥
∥x∥p
≤
2θ
2 −2p
for any x ∈E1.
(2.5)
Proof. Claim that
∥f(2nx)/2n −f(x)∥
∥x∥p

n−1

m=0
2m(p−1)
(2.6)
for any integer n, and some θ ≥0. The veriﬁcation of Eq. [2.6] follows by induction
on n. Indeed the case n = 1 is clear because by the hypothesis we can ﬁnd θ, that is
greater or equal to zero, and p such that 0 ≤p < 1 with
∥f(2x)/2 −f(x)∥
∥x∥p
≤θ.
Assume now that Eq. [2.6] holds and we want to prove it for the case (n+1). However,
this is true because by Eq. [2.6] we obtain
∥f(2n · 2x)/2n −f(2x)∥
∥2x∥p

Thus,

m=0

and Eq. [2.6] is valid for any integer n. It follows then that

(2.7)
because n−1
m=0 2m(p−1) converges to 2/(2−2p) as 0 ≤p < 1. However, for m > n > 0,

Therefore,
lim
n→∞∥f(2mx)/2m −f(2nx)/2n∥= 0.
But E2, as a Banach space, is complete, thus the sequence { f(2nx)/2n} converges. Set
T(x) = lim
n→∞f(2nx)/2n.
It follows that
∥f(2n(x + y)) −f(2nx) −f(2ny)∥≤θ ∥2nx∥p + ∥2ny∥p

or
∥T(x + y) −T(x) −T(y)∥= 0
for any x, y ∈E1
or
T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)
for all x, y ∈E1. Since T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for any x, y ∈E1, T(rx) = rT(x) for
any rational number r. Fix x0 ∈E1 and ρ ∈E∗
2 (the dual space of E2). For t ∈R,
consider the mapping t →ρ(T(tx)) = φ(t). Then φ : R →R satisﬁes the property
that φ(a + b) = φ(a) + φ(b), ie, φ is a group homomorphism. Moreover, φ is a Borel
function, because of the following reasoning. Let φ(t) = limn→∞ρ(f(2ntx0))/2n and
set φn(t) = ρ( f(2ntx0))/2n. Then φn(t) are continuous functions. But φ(t) is the
pointwise limit of continuous functions, thus φ(t) is a Borel function. It is a known
fact that if φ : Rn →Rn is a function such that φ is a group homomorphism, ie,
φ(x + y) = φ(x) + φ(y) and φ is a measurable function, then φ is continuous. In fact
this statement is also true if we replace Rn by any separable, locally compact abelian
group. Therefore, φ is a continuous function. Let a ∈R. Then a = limn→∞rn, where
{rn} is a sequence of rational numbers. Hence,
φ(at) = φ(t lim
n→∞rn) = lim
n→∞φ(trn) = ( lim
n→∞rn)φ(t) = aφ(t).
Therefore, φ(at) = aφ(t) for any a ∈R. Thus T(ax) = aT(x) for any a ∈R. Hence,
T is a linear mapping.
From Eq. [2.7] we obtain
∥f(2nx)/2n −f(x)∥
∥x∥p
≤
2θ
2 −2p ,
or equivalently,
∥T(x) −f(x)∥
∥x∥p
≤ε,
(2.8)
where ε = 2θ/(2 −2p). Thus we have obtained Eq. [2.5].
We want now to prove that T is the unique such linear mapping. Assume that there
exists another one, denoted by g : E1 →E2 such that T(x) ̸= g(x) for some x ∈E1.
Then there exists a constant ε1, greater or equal to zero, and q such that 0 ≤q < 1
with
∥g(x) −f(x)∥
∥x∥q
≤ε1.

12
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
By the triangle inequality and Eq. [2.8], we obtain
∥T(x) −g(x)∥≤∥T(x) −f(x)∥+ ∥f(x) −g(x)∥≤ε∥x∥p + ε1∥x∥q.
Therefore,
∥T(x) −g(x)∥=

n(ε∥nx∥p + ε1∥nx∥q) = np−1ε∥x∥p + nq−1ε1∥x∥q.
Thus limn→∞∥T(x) −g(x)∥= 0 for all x ∈E1 and hence, T(x) ≡g(x) for all x ∈E1.
In 1982, J.M. Rassias [9] considered the Cauchy difference controlled by a product
of different powers of norm.
Theorem 2.2.2 (J.M. Rassias [9]). Let A be a normed linear space with norm ∥· ∥1
and B be a Banach space with norm ∥· ∥2. Assume in addition that f : A →B is a
mapping such that f(tx) is continuous in t for each ﬁxed x. If there exists 0 ≤a < 1/2
and δ > 0 such that
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥2 ≤2δ∥x∥a
1 · ∥y∥a
1
for any x, y ∈A, then there exists a linear mapping L : A →B such that
∥f(x) −L(x)∥2 ≤c∥x∥2a
1
for any x ∈A, where c = δ/(1 −22a−1). If M : A →B be a linear mapping such that
∥f(x) −M(x)∥2 ≤c′∥x∥2b
1
for any x ∈A, where b : 0 ≤b < 1
2 and c′ is a constant, then L(x) = M(x) for any
x ∈A.
Gajda [10], following the same approach as in Rassias [8], obtained the result for
the case p > 1. However, it was veriﬁed that the result for the case p = 1 does not
hold.
Theorem 2.2.3 (Gajda [10]). Let E1 and E2 be two (real) normed linear spaces and
assume that E2 is complete. Let f : E1 →E2 be a mapping for which there exist two
constants ε ∈[0, ∞) and p ∈R \ {1} such that
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤ε∥x∥p + ∥y∥p
for all x, y ∈E1. Then there exists a unique additive mapping T : E1 →E2 such that

Moreover, if for each x ∈E1 the transformation t →f(tx) is continuous for all t ∈R,
then the mapping T is linear.
Rassias and Šemrl [11] generalized the results of Gajda as follows.
Theorem 2.2.4 (Rassias and Šemrl [11]). Let β(s, t) be nonnegative for all non-
negative real numbers s, t and positive homogeneous of degree p, where p is real and
p ̸= 1, ie, β(λs, λt) = λpβ(s, t) for all nonnegative λ, s, t. Given a normed space E1
and a Banach space E2, assume that f : E1 →E2 satisﬁes the inequality
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤β(∥x∥, ∥y∥)
for all x, y ∈E1, where
δ :=

2−2p ,
if p < 1;
β(1,1)
2−2p ,
if p > 1.
Corollary 2.2.5 (Rassias and Šemrl [11]). Let f : E1 →E2 be a mapping satisfying
the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2.4 and suppose that f is continuous at a single point
y ∈E1. Then the additive mapping g is continuous.
Corollary 2.2.6 (Rassias and Šemrl [11]). If, under the hypotheses of Theo-
rem 2.2.4, we assume that, for each ﬁxed x ∈E1, the mapping t →f(tx) from R
to E2 is continuous, then the additive mapping g is linear.
A further generalization of the Hyers-Ulam stability for a large class of mappings
was obtained by Isac and Rassias. They also presented some applications in nonlinear
analysis, especially in ﬁxed point theory.
Theorem 2.2.7 (Isac and Rassias [12]). Let E1 and E2 be a real normed space and
a real Banach space, respectively. Let ψ : [0, ∞) →[0, ∞) be a function satisfying
the following conditions:
(R1) limt→∞ψ(t)/t = 0,
(R2) ψ(ts) ≤ψ(t)ψ(s) for all t, s ∈[0, ∞),
(R3) ψ(t) ≤t for all t > 1.
If a function f : E1 →E2 satisﬁes the inequality
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤θ (ψ(∥x∥) + ψ(∥y∥))
for some θ ≥0 and for all x, y ∈E1, then there exists a unique additive function
A : E1 →E2 such that

∥f(x) −A(x)∥≤
2θ
2 −ψ(2)ψ(∥x∥)
for all x ∈E1. Moreover, if f(tx) is continuous in t for each ﬁxed x, then the function A
is linear.
The method of Baker in Section 2.1 was generalized in 2003 by Radu [13], as
follows.
Theorem 2.2.8 (Banach contraction principle). Let (X, m) be a complete gener-
alized metric space and consider a mapping T : X →X as a strictly contractive
mapping, that is
m(Tx, Ty) ≤Lm(x, y)
for all x, y ∈X and for some (Lipschitz constant) 0 < L < 1. Then
•
T has one and only one ﬁxed point x∗= T(x∗);
•
x∗is globally attractive, that is, limn→∞Tnx = x∗for any starting point x ∈X; and
•
one has the following estimation inequalities for all x ∈X and n ≥0
m(Tnx, x∗) ≤Lnm(x, x∗),
m(Tnx, x∗) ≤
1
1 −LLnm(Tnx, Tn+1x),
m(x, x∗) ≤
1
1 −Lm(x, Tx).
Theorem 2.2.9 (The Alternative of Fixed Point [14]). Suppose that we are given
a complete generalized metric space (X, m) and a strictly contractive mapping T :
X →X with Lipschitz constant L. Then, for each given element x ∈X, either
m(Tnx, Tn+1x) = +∞for all nonnegative integers n or there exists a positive
integer n0 such that m(Tnx, Tn+1x) < +∞for all n ≥n0. If the second alternative
holds, then
⋆
the sequence (Tnx) is convergent to a ﬁxed point y∗of T;
⋆
y∗is the unique ﬁxed point of T in the set Y = {y ∈X, m(Tn0x, y) < +∞}; and
⋆
m(y, y∗) ≤
1
1−Lm(y, Ty) , y ∈Y.
Radu showed that the theorems of Hyers, Rassias, and Gajda concerning the
stability of Cauchy’s functional equation in Banach spaces are direct consequences
of the alternative of ﬁxed point.
2.3
Completeness of normed spaces
In most stability theorems for functional equations, the completeness of the target space
of the unknown functions contained in the equation is assumed. In this section, we

Approximate Cauchy functional equations and completeness
15
investigate the question of whether the stability of a functional equation implies this
completeness.
During the 25th International Symposium on Functional Equations in 1988, this
problem was considered by Schwaiger, who proved that if X is a normed space, then
the stability of Cauchy’s functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) (x, y ∈Z)
for functions f
: Z →X implies the completeness of X (cf. [15]). Forti and
Schwaiger [16] proved that an analogous statement is valid if the domain of f is
an abelian group containing an element of inﬁnite order. Moszner [17] showed that
the assumptions of this theorem are essential and presented some applications of the
result above.
Let (G, +) be an abelian group and let E be a normed space. A mapping f : G →E
is called ε-quadratic if for a given ε > 0 it satisﬁes
∥f(x + y) + f(x −y) −2f(x) −2f(y)∥≤ε
for all x, y ∈G. In 2010, Najati [18] showed that E is complete if every ε-quadratic
mapping f : X →E can be estimated by a quadratic mapping, where X is N0 or a
ﬁnitely generated free abelian group. In this section, we consider the results given by
Najati [18].
Let us denote the sets N0 × · · · × N0

	

r-times
and Z × · · · × Z


by Nr
0 and Zr, respectively.
The proof of the following lemma is obvious:
Lemma 2.3.1 (Najati [18]). Let f : Nr
0 →E (f : Zr →E) be a quadratic
mapping, ie,
f(m1 + n1, . . ., mr + nr) + f(m1 −n1, . . ., mr −nr) = 2f(m1, . . ., mr)
+ 2f(n1, . . ., nr)
for all mi ≥ni ≥0 (mi, ni ∈Z) with 1 ≤i ≤r. Then
f(m, . . . , m) = m2f(1, . . ., 1)
for all m ∈N0 (m ∈Z).
Lemma 2.3.2 (Najati [18]). Let f : N0 →E be an ε-quadratic mapping, ie,
∥f(m + n) + f(m −n) −2f(m) −2f(n)∥≤ε
(m ≥n ≥0).
Then the mapping g : Z →E deﬁned by g(n) = f(|n|) is ε-quadratic.
Proof. For convenience, we use the following abbreviations:
Qf(m, n) = f(m + n) + f(m −n) −2f(m) −2f(n)
(m ≥n ≥0),
Qg(m, n) = g(m + n) + g(m −n) −2g(m) −2g(n)
m, n ∈Z.

16

It follows from the deﬁnition of g that
Qf(m, n) =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
Qf(m, n),
if m ≥n ≥0,
Qf(n, m),

Qf(−n, −m),
if m, n < 0, m ≥n,
Qf(−m, −n),
if m, n < 0, m < n,
Qg(m, −n),
if n < 0 ≤m, m + n ≥0,
Qg(−n, m),
if n < 0 ≤m, m + n < 0,
Qg(n, −m),
if m < 0 ≤n, m + n ≥0,
Qg(−m, n),
if m < 0 ≤n, m + n < 0.
Indeed,
Qf(m, n) =
 Qf(|m|, |n|),
if |m| ≥|n|,
Qf(|n|, |m|),
if |n| ≥|m|,
for all m, n ∈Z. Therefore, g is ε-quadratic on Z.
Using the proof of Lemma 2.3.2, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 2.3.3 (Najati [18]). Let f : Nr
0 →E be an ε-quadratic mapping. Then
the mapping g : Zr →E deﬁned by
g(n1, n2, . . . , nr) = f(|n1|, |n2|, . . ., |nr|)
is ε-quadratic.
Theorem 2.3.4 (Najati [18]). Let E be a normed space such that for each ε-
quadratic mapping f : Zr →E there exists a quadratic mapping Q : Zr →E such
that Q −f is uniformly bounded on Zr. Then E is complete.
Proof. Let us have ε > 0 and let {xn}n≥1 be a Cauchy sequence in E. There exists a
subsequence {xnk}k≥1 such that ∥Xn−xm∥<

for all mi > ki ≥0, where 1 ≤i ≤r. Hence, it follows from f(0, . . ., 0) = 0 that f
is ε-quadratic. By Lemma 2.3.2, the mapping g : Zr →E deﬁned by g(k1, . . ., kr) =
f(|k1|, . . . , |kr|) is ε-quadratic. By our assumption, there exists a quadratic mapping
Q : Zr →E and a positive constant M such that
∥g(k1, . . ., kr) −Q(k1, . . ., kr)∥≤M,
(k1, . . . , kr) ∈Zr. Since Q is quadratic on Zr, by Lemma 2.3.1 we have Q(k, . . . , k) =
k2Q(1, . . ., 1) for all k ∈Z. Therefore,
∥k2xnk −k2Q(1, . . ., 1)∥≤M
for all positive integers k. This shows that the subsequence {xnk}k≥1 converges to
Q(1, . . ., 1). Hence, the Cauchy sequence {xn}n≥1 also converges to Q(1, . . ., 1), and
the theorem is proved.
The following result follows from the proof of Theorem 2.3.4.
Theorem 2.3.5 (Najati [18]). Let E be a normed space such that for each ε-
quadratic mapping f : Nr
0 →E there exists a quadratic mapping Q : Nr
0 →E
such that Q −f is uniformly bounded on Nr
0. Then E is complete.
Corollary 2.3.6 (Najati [18]). Let E be a normed space such that for each ε-
quadratic mapping f : Z →E (f : N0 →E) there exists a quadratic mapping
Q : Z →E (Q : N0 →E) such that Q −f is uniformly bounded on Z (N0). Then E is
complete.
Theorem 2.3.4 remains true if we replace Zr by a ﬁnitely generated free abelian
group.
Theorem 2.3.7 (Najati [18]). Let G be a ﬁnitely generated free abelian group and
E be a normed space such that for each ε-quadratic mapping f : G →E there exists a
quadratic mapping Q : G →E such that Q −f is uniformly bounded on G. Then E is
complete.
Proof. Let {g1, . . . , gr} be a basis for G and let f : Zr →E be an ε-quadratic
mapping. We deﬁne the mapping φ : G →E by φ
r
i=1 nigi


It is clear that φ is ε-quadratic. By the assumption, there exists a quadratic map-

E such that Q −φ is uniformly bounded on G. Let T

Zr →E be a mapping deﬁned by T(n1, . . ., nr) = Q

. Hence, T is
quadratic and T −f is uniformly bounded on Zr. Hence, by Theorem 2.3.4, E is
complete.
In 2013, Fošner et al. [19] gave a type of characterization of Banach spaces in terms
of the stability of functional equations. More precisely, they proved that a normed space
X is complete if there exists a functional equation of the type

(2.9)
with given real numbers a1, . . . , an, given mappings φ1, . . . , φn : Dk →D and
unknown function f : D →X, which has a Hyers-Ulam stability property on an inﬁnite
subset D of the integers.

18
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
We say that the functional equation [2.9] satisﬁes a (strong) Hyers-Ulam stability
property on D if there exists a polynomial p of degree of at least 1 on D such that pb
solves Eq. [2.9] with some b ∈X, b ̸= 0; furthermore, if, for a function f : D →X,
the left-hand side of Eq. [2.9] is bounded, then there exists a function g : D →X,
which has the form g(x) = p(x)c, (x ∈D), with a c ∈X, satisﬁes the Eq. [2.9] and the
difference f −g is uniformly bounded on D.
The class of equations given in Eq. [2.9] contains the Cauchy equation
f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)
(x, y ∈Z),
the square norm equation
f(x + y) + f(x −y) = 2f(x) + 2f(y)
(x, y ∈Z),
and several other well-known functional equations as a special case. It is also easy to
see that monomial functional equations, polynomial functional equations and, using
the notation above, even linear functional equations of the form
n

i=1
aif(pix + qiy) = 0
(x, y ∈Z),
(2.10)
where p1, . . ., pn and q1, . . . , qn are given integers and f : Z →X is an unknown
function, are contained in the class [2.9]. In the next theorem, a reverse statement of
Hyers-Ulam stability is considered.
Theorem 2.3.8 (Fošner et al. [19]). Let X be a normed space. If there exists a
functional equation of type [2.9] which has the Hyers-Ulam stability property above
on an inﬁnite subset D of the integers, then X is complete.
Proof. Let ¯X be the completion of X and let ¯c ∈¯X. Let, furthermore, g : D →¯X
be given by the formula g(x) = p(x)¯c, (x ∈D), where p is the polynomial considered
in the deﬁnition of the stability property. Since X is dense in ¯X, there exists a function
h : D →X such that
∥g(x) −h(x)∥≤1
(x ∈D).

The stability property implies the existence of a c ∈X {0} such that
∥h(x) −p(x)c∥≤L
(x ∈D)
(2.12)
with some L ∈R. Using the inequalities [2.11] and [2.12], we obtain
∥p(x)¯c −p(x)c∥≤∥p(x)¯c −h(x)∥+ ∥h(x) −p(x)c∥≤1 + L,
thus,
∥¯c −c∥≤1 + L
|p(x)|
(x ∈D, p(x) ̸= 0).
Letting |x| →∞, we get that ¯c = c, which yields our statement.

Stability of mixed type
functional equations
3.1
Binary mixtures of functional equations
The functional equation
f(x + y) + f(x −y) = 2f(x) + 2f(y)
(3.1)
is related to a symmetric bi-additive function [20, 21]. The functional equation (3.1) is
called quadratic. In particular, every solution of the quadratic equation (3.1) is said to
be a quadratic function. It is well known that a function f between real vector spaces
is quadratic if and only if there exists a unique symmetric bi-additive function B such
that f(x) = B(x, x) for all x (see [20, 21]. The bi-additive function B is given by
B(x, y) = 1
4[f(x + y) −f(x −y)].
Jun and Kim [22] introduced the following cubic functional equation:
f(2x + y) + f(2x −y) = 2f(x + y) + 2f(x −y) + 12f(x)
(3.2)
and they established the general solution and the generalized Hyers-Ulam stability
problem for the functional equation (3.2). Let E1 and E2 be real vector spaces. They
proved that a function f : E1 →E2 satisﬁes the functional equation (3.2) if and only
if there exists a function G : E1 × E1 × E1 →E2 such that f(x) = G(x, x, x) for all
x ∈E1, and G is symmetric for each ﬁxed one variable and additive for each ﬁxed two
variables. The function G is given by
G(x, y, z) = 1
24[f(x + y + z) + f(x −y −z) −f(x + y −z) −f(x −y + z)]
for all x, y, z ∈E1. It is easy to see that the function f(x) = cx3 is a solution of the
functional equation (3.2). Thus, it is natural that Eq. [3.2] is called a cubic functional
equation and every solution of the cubic functional equation (3.2) is said to be a cubic
function.

Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
Chang and Jung [23] introduced the following functional equation deriving from
cubic and quadratic functions:
6f(x + y) −6f(x −y) + 4f(3y) = 3f(x + 2y) −3f(x −2y) + 9f(2y).
(3.3)
It is easy to see that the function f(x) = ax2 + bx3 is a solution of Eq. [3.3]. We deal
with the solution and stability of the functional equation (3.3).
Lemma 3.1.1 (Chang and Jung [23]). Let X and Y be real vector spaces. If an even
function f : X →Y satisﬁes Eq. [3.3] for all x, y ∈X, then f is quadratic.
Lemma 3.1.2 (Chang and Jung [23]). Let X and Y be real vector spaces. If an odd
function f : X →Y satisﬁes Eq. [3.3] for all x, y ∈X, then f is cubic.
Theorem 3.1.3 (Chang and Jung [23]). A function f : X →Y satisﬁes Eq. [3.3] for
all x, y ∈X if and only if there exist a symmetric biadditive function B : X × X →Y
and a function G : X × X × X →Y such that f(x) = G(x, x, x) + B(x, x) for all x ∈X,
and G is symmetric for ﬁxed one variable and G is additive for ﬁxed two variables.
Proof. If there exists a symmetric biadditive function B : X ×X →Y and a function
G : X × X × X →Y such that f(x) = G(x, x, x) + B(x, x) for all x ∈X, and G is
symmetric for ﬁxed one variable and C is additive for ﬁxed two variables, it is obvious
that f satisﬁes Eq. [3.3].
Conversely, we decompose f into the even part and the odd part by putting
fe(x) = 1
2[f(x) + f(−x)]
and
fo(x) = 1
2[f(x) −f(−x)]
for all x ∈X. It is easy to show by Lemmas 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 that we achieve the result.
Now, we prove the stability of Eq. [3.3] in the spirit of generalized Hyers-Ulam. For
convenience, we use the following abbreviation:
Df(x, y) := 6f(x + y) −6f(x −y) + 4f(3y) −3f(x + 2y) + 3f(x −2y) −9f(2y).
Theorem 3.1.4 (Chang and Jung [23]). Let X be a real vector space and Y be a real
Banach space. Let φ : X × X →[0, ∞) be a function such that

∥f(3x) + 3f(x) −3f(2x)∥≤φ(x, x)

Eq. [3.13] implies that
∥12f(y) + 4f(3y) −15f(2y)∥≤φ(0, y),
which on replacing y by x yields
∥12f(x) + 4f(3x) −15f(2x)∥≤φ(0, x)

∥3f(x) −f(3x) + 3f(2x)∥≤φ(x, x)

and ∥DC(x, y)∥= 0 for all x, y ∈X as in the proof of Theorem 3.1.4, and so from
Lemma 3.1.2, it follows that C is cubic.
We claim that C is unique. Let ˜C : X →Y be another cubic function satisfying
Eqs. [3.3] and (3.15). Since ˜C(2nx) = 8n ˜C(x) and C(2nx) = 8nC(x) for all x ∈X, the

Proof. Let fe(x) = 1

and
∥Dfe(x, y)∥≤1
2[φ(x, y) + φ(−x, −y)]
for all x, y ∈X. Hence, in view of Theorem 3.1.4, there exists a unique quadratic
function q : X →Y satisfying Eq. [3.5]. Let fo(x) = 1
2(f(x) −f(−x)) for all x ∈X.
Then fo(0) = 0, fo(−x) = −fo(x) and
∥Dfo(x, y)∥≤1
2[φ(x, y) + φ(−x, −y)]
for all x, y ∈X. From Theorem 3.1.5, it follows that there exists a unique cubic function
C : X →Y satisfying Eq. [3.15]. Now it is obvious that Eq. [3.23] holds true for all
x ∈X and so the proof of the theorem is complete.

where l is a positive integer with l ≥2. Let both E1 and E2 be real vector spaces. A
mapping f : E1 →E2 satisﬁes the functional equation (3.24) if and only if there exist
two mappings G : E1 × E1 × E1 →E2 and A : E1 →E2 and a constant c in E2 such
that
f(x) = G(x, x, x) + A(x) + c
for all x ∈E1, where A is additive, and G is symmetric for each ﬁxed one variable and
additive for each ﬁxed two variables. Additionally they solved the generalized Hyers-
Ulam stability problem for Eq. [3.24] under the approximately cubic (or additive)
condition by the iterative methods.
The generalized Hyers-Ulam stability for a mixed type of quadratic and additive
functional equation in quasi-Banach spaces has been investigated by Najati and
Moghimi [25]. They dealt with the functional equation
f(2x + y) + f(2x −y) = f(x + y) + f(x −y) + 2f(2x) −2f(x).
(3.25)
It is easy to see that the function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c is a solution of the functional
equation (3.25). They investigated the generalized Hyers-Ulam stability for Eq. [3.25]
in quasi-Banach spaces.
In [26], Prak and Bae considered the following quartic functional equation:
f(x + 2y) + f(x −2y) = 4(f(x + y) + f(x −y) + 6f(y)) −6f(x).
(3.26)
In fact, they proved that a function f between two real vector spaces X and Y is a
solution of Eq. [3.26] if and only if there exists a unique symmetric multi-additive
function D : X × X × X × X →Y such that f(x) = D(x, x, x, x) for all x ∈X. It is easy
to show that the function f(x) = x4 satisﬁes the functional equation (3.26), which is
called a quartic functional equation.
Eshaghi et al. [27] established the general solution of the functional equation
f(nx+y)+f(nx−y) = n2f(x+y)+n2f(x−y)+2(f(nx)−n2f(x))−2(n2−1) f(y)
(3.27)
for ﬁxed integers n with n ̸= 0, ±1 and investigate the generalized Hyers-Ulam
stability of this equation in quasi-Banach spaces. It is easy to see that the function
f(x) = ax4 + bx2 is a solution of the functional equation (3.27).

Stability of mixed type functional equations

Lemma 3.1.9 (Eshaghi et al. [27]). Let X and Y be real vector spaces. If a function
f : X →Y satisﬁes the functional equation (3.27), then f is a quadratic and quartic
function.
Theorem 3.1.10 (Eshaghi et al. [27]). A function f : X →Y satisﬁes Eq. [3.27] if
and only if there exist a unique symmetric multi-additive function D : X×X×X×X →
Y and a unique symmetric bi-additive function B : X × X →Y such that
f(x) = D(x, x, x, x) + B(x, x)
for all x ∈X.
Proof. We ﬁrst assume that the function f : X →Y satisﬁes Eq. [3.27]. Let g, h :
X →Y be functions deﬁned by
g(x) := f(2x) −16f(x),
h(x) := f(2x) −4f(x)
for all x ∈X. Hence, by Lemma 3.1.9, we achieve that the functions g and h are
quadratic and quartic, respectively, and
f(x) := 1
12h(x) −1
12g(x)
for all x ∈X. Therefore, there exist a unique symmetric multi-additive mapping
D : X × X × X × X →Y and a unique symmetric bi-additive mapping B : X × X →Y
such that D(x, x, x, x) = 1
12h(x) and B(x, x) = −1
12g(x) for all x ∈X. So
f(x) = D(x, x, x, x) + B(x, x)
for all x ∈X.
Conversely, assume that
f(x) = D(x, x, x, x) + B(x, x)
for all x ∈X, where the function D : X × X × X × X →Y is symmetric multi-additive
and B : X × X →Y is bi-additive deﬁned above. By a simple computation, one can
show that the functions D and B satisfy the functional equation (3.27), so the function
f satisﬁes Eq. [3.27].

Eshaghi and Khodaei [28] introduce the following functional equation for ﬁxed
integers k with k ̸= 0, ±1:
f(x + ky) + f(x −ky) = k2f(x + y) + k2f(x −y) + 2(1 −k2) f(x),
(3.28)

Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
with f(0) = 0. It is easy to see that the function f(x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx is a solution
of the functional equation (3.28). In this section, we investigate the general solution of
functional equation (3.28) when f is a mapping between vector spaces, and we establish
the generalized Hyers-Ulam stability of the functional equation (3.28) whenever f is a
function between two quasi-Banach spaces.
Lemma 3.2.1 (Eshaghi and Khodaei [28]). Let X and Y be real vector spaces. If an
even function f : X →Y with f(0) = 0 satisﬁes Eq. [3.28], then f is quadratic.
Proof. Setting x = 0 in Eq. [3.28], by evenness of f, we obtain f(kx) = k2f(x) for
all x ∈X. Replacing x by kx in Eq. [3.28] and then using the identity f(kx) = k2f(x),
we lead to
f(kx + y) + f(kx −y) = f(x + y) + f(x −y) + 2(k2 −1)f(x)
(3.29)
for all x, y ∈X. Interchanging x with y in Eq. [3.28] gives
f(y + kx) + f(y −kx) = k2f(y + x) + k2f(y −x) + 2(1 −k2)f(y)
(3.30)
for all x, y ∈X. By evenness of f, it follows from Eq. [3.30] that
f(kx + y) + f(kx −y) = k2f(x + y) + k2f(x −y) + 2(1 −k2)f(y)
(3.31)
for all x, y ∈X. But, k ̸= 0, ±1 so from Eqs. [3.29] and (3.31), we obtain
f(x + y) + f(x −y) = 2f(x) + 2f(y)
for all x, y ∈X. This shows that f is quadratic, which completes the proof of lemma.
Lemma 3.2.2 (Eshaghi and Khodaei [28]). If an odd function f : X →Y satisﬁes
Eq. [3.28], then f is cubic-additive.
Proof. Letting y = x in Eq. [3.28], we get, by oddness of f,
f((k + 1)x) = f((k −1)x) + k2f(2x) + 2(1 −k2)f(x)
(3.32)
for all x, y ∈X. Replacing x by (k −1)x in Eq. [3.28] gives
f((k −1)x + ky) + f((k −1)x −ky)
= k2f((k −1)x + y) + k2f((k −1)x −y) + 2(1 −k2)f((k −1)x)
(3.33)
for all x, y ∈X. Now, if we replace x with (k + 1)x in Eq. [3.28] and use Eq. [3.32],
we see that
f((k + 1)x + ky) + f((k + 1)x −ky)
= k2f((k + 1)x + y) + k2f((k + 1)x −y) + 2(1 −k2)f((k −1)x)
+ 2k2(1 −k2)f(2x) + 4(1 −k2)2f(x)
(3.34)

Stability of mixed type functional equations
31
for all x, y ∈X. We substitute x + y in place of x in Eq. [3.28] and then x −y in place
of x in Eq. [3.28] to obtain that
f(x+(k+1)y)+f(x−(k−1)y) = k2f(x+2y)+2(1−k2)f(x+y)+k2f(x) (3.35)
and
f(x−(k+1)y)+f(x+(k−1)y) = k2f(x−2y)+2(1−k2)f(x−y)+k2f(x) (3.36)
for all x, y ∈X. If we subtract Eq. [3.36] from Eq. [3.35], we have
f(x + (k + 1)y) −f(x −(k + 1)y)
= k2f(x + 2y) −k2f(x −2y) + f(x + (k −1)y) −f(x −(k −1)y)
+ 2(1 −k2)f(x + y) −2(1 −k2)f(x −y)
(3.37)
for all x, y ∈X. Interchanging x with y in Eq. [3.37] and using oddness of f, we get the
relation
f((k + 1)x + y) + f((k + 1)x −y)
= k2f(2x + y) + k2f(2x −y) + f((k −1)x + y) + f((k −1)x −y)
+ 2(1 −k2)f(x + y) + 2(1 −k2)f(x −y)
(3.38)
for all x, y ∈X. It follows from Eqs. [3.34] and (3.38) that
f((k + 1)x + ky) + f((k + 1)x −ky)
= k2f((k −1)x + y) + k2f((k −1)x −y) + k4f(2x + y) + k4f(2x −y)
+ 2k2(1 −k2)f(x + y) + 2k2(1 −k2)f(x −y)
+ 2(1 −k2)f((k −1)x) + 2k2(1 −k2)f(2x) + 4(1 −k2)2f(x)
(3.39)
for all x, y ∈X. We substitute x + y in place of y in Eq. [3.28] and then x −y in place
of y in Eq. [3.28], and we get, by the oddness of f,
f((k+1)x+ky)−f((k−1)x+ky) = k2f(2x+y)+k2f(−y)+2(1−k2)f(x) (3.40)
and
f((k + 1)x −ky) −f((k−1)x −ky) = k2f(2x −y) + k2f(y) + 2(1 −k2)f(x) (3.41)
for all x, y ∈X. Then, by adding Eq. [3.40] to Eq. [3.41] and then using Eq. [3.33],
we lead to
f((k + 1)x + ky) + f((k + 1)x −ky)
= k2f((k −1)x + y) + k2f((k −1)x −y) + 2(1 −k2)f((k −1)x)
+ k2f(2x + y) + k2f(2x −y) + 4(1 −k2)f(x)
(3.42)

32
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
for all x, y ∈X. Finally, if we compare Eq. [3.39] with Eq. [3.42], then we conclude that
f(2x + y) + f(2x −y) = 2f(x + y) + 2f(x −y) + 2(f(2x) −2f(x))
for all x, y ∈X. Hence, f is a cubic-additive function (see Section 3.1). This completes
the proof.
Theorem 3.2.3 (Eshaghi and Khodaei [28]). A function f : X →Y with f(0) = 0
satisﬁes Eq. [3.28] for all x, y ∈X if and only if there exist functions G : X×X×X →Y,
B : X × X →Y and A : X →Y such that f(x) = G(x, x, x) + B(x, x) + A(x) for all
x ∈X, where the function G is symmetric for each ﬁxed one variable and is additive
for ﬁxed two variables, and B is symmetric bi-additive and A is additive.
Proof. Let f with f(0) = 0 satisﬁes Eq. [3.28]. We decompose f into the even part
and odd part by putting
fe(x) = 1
2(f(x) + f(−x)),
fo(x) = 1
2(f(x) −f(−x)),
for all x ∈X. It is clear that f(x) = fe(x) + fo(x) for all x ∈X. It is easy to show
that the functions fe and fo satisfy Eq. [3.28]. Hence by Lemmas 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, we
achieve that the functions fe and fo are quadratic and cubic-additive, respectively, thus
there exist a symmetric bi-additive function B : X × X →Y such that fe(x) = B(x, x)
for all x ∈X, and the function G : X × X × X →Y and additive function A : X →Y
such that fo(x) = G(x, x, x)+A(x), for all x ∈X, where the function G is symmetric for
each ﬁxed one variable and is additive for ﬁxed two variables. Hence, we get f(x) =
G(x, x, x) + B(x, x) + A(x), for all x ∈X.
Conversely, let f(x) = G(x, x, x)+B(x, x)+A(x) for all x ∈X, where the function G
is symmetric for each ﬁxed one variable and is additive for ﬁxed two variables, and B is
bi-additive and A is additive. By a simple computation one can show that the functions
x 	→G(x, x, x) and x 	→B(x, x) and A satisfy the functional equation (3.28). So the
function f satisﬁes Eq. [3.28].
We now recall some basic facts concerning quasi-Banach space and some prelimi-
nary results.
Deﬁnition 3.2.4 ([18]). Let X be a real linear space. A quasi-norm is a real-valued
function on X satisfying the following:
1. ∥x∥≥0 for all x ∈X and ∥x∥= 0 if and only if x = 0;
2. ∥λ · x∥= |λ| · ∥x∥for all λ ∈R and all x ∈X;
3. There is a constant M ≥1 such that ∥x + y∥≤M(∥x∥+ ∥y∥) for all x, y ∈X.

The pair (X, ∥· ∥) is called a quasi-normed space if ∥· ∥is a quasi-norm on X. The
smallest possible M is called the modulus of concavity of ∥· ∥. A quasi-Banach space
is a complete quasi-normed space.
A quasi-norm ∥· ∥is called a p-norm (0 < p ≤1) if
∥x + y∥p ≤∥x∥p + ∥y∥p
for all x, y ∈X. In this case, a quasi-Banach space is called a p-Banach space.
Given a p-norm, the formula d(x, y) := ∥x −y∥p gives us a translation invariant
metric on X. By the Aoki-Rolewicz Theorem [29] (see also [30]), each quasi-norm
is equivalent to some p-norm. Since it is much easier to work with p-norms, we
henceforth restrict our attention mainly to p-norms. Moreover, J. Tabor [31] has
investigated a version of Hyers-Rassias-Gajda theorem in quasi-Banach spaces.

Eq. [3.46] for all x ∈X. Letting m = 0 and passing the limit n →∞in Eq. [3.52],
we get

even function, then Eq. [3.46] implies that the function Q : X →Y is even. Therefore
by Lemma 3.2.1, we get that the function Q : X →Y is quadratic.
To prove the uniqueness of Q, let Q′ : X →Y be another quadratic function

For j = −1, we can prove the theorem by a similar technique.
Corollary 3.2.7 (Eshaghi and Khodaei [28]). Let θ, r, s be nonnegative real num-
bers such that r, s > 2 or 0 ≤r, s < 2. Suppose that an even function f : X →Y with
f(0) = 0 satisﬁes the inequality
∥Df (x, y)∥Y ≤θ(∥x∥r

(3.63)
for all x ∈X. It follows from Eq. [3.63] that
∥f(2(k + 1)x) −f(2(k −1)x) −k2f(4x) + 2(k2 −1)f(2x)∥≤ϕa(2x, 2x)
(3.64)
for all x ∈X. Replacing x and y by 2x and x in Eq. [3.62], respectively, we get
∥f((k+2)x)−f((k−2)x)−k2f(3x)−k2f(x)+2(k2−1)f(2x)∥≤ϕa(2x, x) (3.65)
for all x ∈X. Setting y = 2x in Eq. [3.62] gives

for all x ∈X. Putting y = 3x in Eq. [3.62], we obtain

(3.76)

cubic.
To prove the uniqueness of C, let C′ : X →Y be another additive function satisfying

derived from quartic, cubic, quadratic, and additive functions. It is easy to see that
the function f(x) = ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx is a solution of the functional equation
(3.115). We investigate the general solution of functional equation (3.115) when f is
a mapping between vector spaces and establish the generalized Hyers-Ulam stability
of the functional equation (3.115) in non-Archimedean normed spaces. The results
achieved in this section are comprehensive in that they contain the results in the papers
obtained by Chang and Jung [23], Eshaghi Gordji et al. [32], Jun and Kim [24], Kim
[33], Najati and Moghimi [25], Najati and Zamani Eskandani [34], and also some other
papers.
In 1897, Hensel [35] introduced a normed space which does not have the
Archimedean property. A non-Archimedean ﬁeld is a ﬁeld K equipped with a function
(valuation) | · | from K into [0, ∞) such that |r| = 0 if and only if r = 0, |rs| = |r||s|,
and |r + s| ≤max{|r|, |s|} for all r, s ∈K. Clearly |1| = | −1| = 1 and |n| ≤1
for all n ∈N. An example of a non-Archimedean valuation is the function | · | taking
everything but 0 into 1 and |0| = 0. This valuation is called trivial.
Deﬁnition 3.3.1 ([35]). Let X be a vector space over a scalar ﬁeld K with a non-
Archimedean non-trivial valuation |·|. A function ∥·∥: X →R is a non-Archimedean
norm (valuation) if it satisﬁes the following conditions:
(NA1) ∥x∥= 0 if and only if x = 0;
(NA2) ∥rx∥= |r|∥x∥for all r ∈K and x ∈X;
(NA3) ∥x + y∥≤max{∥x∥, ∥y∥} for all x, y ∈X (the strong triangle inequality).

Then (X, ∥· ∥) is called a non-Archimedean space.
Remark 3.3.2 ([35]). Thanks to the inequality
∥xm −xl∥≤max{∥xj+1 −xj∥: l ≤j ≤m −1},
(m > l),
a sequence {xm} is Cauchy if and only if {xm+1 −xm} converges to zero in a non-
Archimedean space. By a complete non-Archimedean space we mean one in which
every Cauchy sequence is convergent.
The most important examples of non-Archimedean spaces are p-adic numbers. A
key property of p-adic numbers is that they do not satisfy the Archimedean axiom: for
x, y > 0, there exists n ∈N such that x < ny.
Example 3.3.3 ([35]). Let p be a prime number. For any nonzero rational number,
x = a
bpnx such that a and b are integers not divisible by p, deﬁne the p-adic absolute
value |x|p := p−nx. Then | · | is a non-Archimedean norm on Q. The completion of Q
with respect to | · | is denoted by Qp which is called the p-adic number ﬁeld.
Note that if p > 3, then |2n| = 1 for each integer n. Arriola and Beyer [36] inve-
stigated the stability of approximate additive functions f : Qp →R. They showed that
if f : Qp →R is a continuous function for which there exists a ﬁxed ε > 0 such that
|f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)| ≤ε
for all x, y ∈Qp, then there exists a unique additive function T : Qp →R such that
|f(x) −T(x)| ≤ε
for all x ∈Qp.
Throughout this section, assume that G is an additive group and X is a complete
non-Archimedean space. Before taking up the main subject, given f : G × G →X, we
deﬁne the difference operator
Df(x, y) = f(x + ky) + f(x −ky) −k2f(x + y) −k2f(x −y)

(3.121)
then A is the unique additive function satisfying Eq. [3.120].
Proof. Let ℓ= 1. It follows from Eq. [3.119] and oddness of f that
∥f(ky+x)−f(ky−x)−k2f(x+y)−k2f(x−y)+2(k2 −1)f(x)∥≤ϕ(x, y) (3.122)
for all x, y ∈G. Putting y = x in Eq. [3.122], we have
∥f((k + 1)x) −f((k −1)x) −k2f(2x) + 2(k2 −1)f(x)∥≤ϕ(x, x)
(3.123)
for all x ∈G. It follows from Eq. [3.123] that
∥f(2(k + 1)x) −f(2(k −1)x) −k2f(4x) + 2(k2 −1)f(2x)∥≤ϕ(2x, 2x)
(3.124)
for all x ∈G. Replacing x and y by 2x and x in Eq. [3.122], respectively, we get
∥f((k+2)x)−f((k−2)x)−k2f(3x)−k2f(x)+2(k2−1)f(2x)∥≤ϕ(2x, x) (3.125)
for all x ∈G. Setting y = 2x in Eq. [3.122], one obtains
∥f((2k+1)x)−f((2k−1)x)−k2f(3x)−k2f(−x)+2(k2−1)f(x)∥≤ϕ(x, 2x) (3.126)

for all x ∈G. Replacing x and y by (k + 1)x and x in Eq. [3.122], respectively, we get

≤ϕ((k + 1)x, x)
(3.128)
for all x ∈G. Replacing x and y by (k −1)x and x in Eq. [3.122], respectively, one gets

≤ϕ((k −1)x, x)
(3.129)
for all x ∈G. Replacing x and y by (2k + 1)x and x in Eq. [3.122], respectively, we
obtain
∥f((3k + 1)x) −f(−(k + 1)x) −k2f(2(k + 1)x) −k2f(2kx)
+ 2(k2 −1)f((2k + 1)x)∥≤ϕ((2k + 1)x, x)
(3.130)
for all x ∈G. If we replace x and y by (2k −1)x and x in Eq. [3.122], respectively, then
we have
∥f((3k −1)x) −f(−(k −1)x) −k2f(2(k −1)x) −k2f(2kx)
+ 2(k2 −1)f((2k −1)x)∥≤ϕ((2k −1)x, x)
(3.131)
for all x ∈G. It follows from Eqs. [3.123], (3.125), (3.126), (3.128), and (3.129) that
∥f(3x) −4f(2x) + 5f(x)∥≤

max{|k2|ϕ(2x, x), ϕ(x, 2x)},
max{ϕ((k + 1)x, x), ϕ((k −1)x, x)}}
(3.132)
for all x ∈G. Also, from Eqs. [3.123], (3.124), (3.126), (3.127), (3.130), and (3.131),
we conclude that

for all x ∈G. Finally, by using Eqs. [3.132] and (3.133), we obtain that

max{ϕ((2k + 1)x, x), ϕ((2k −1)x, x)}}}
(3.134)
for all x ∈G, and let
˜ψ(x) :=

max{|k2|ϕ(2x, x), ϕ(x, 2x)}, max{ϕ((k + 1)x, x), ϕ((k −1)x, x)}},
max{max{ϕ(x, x), |k2|ϕ(2x, 2x)}, max{|2(k2 −1)|ϕ(x, 2x), ϕ(x, 3x)},
max{ϕ((2k + 1)x, x), ϕ((2k −1)x, x)}}}
(3.135)
for all x ∈G. Thus Eq. [3.134] means that
∥f(4x) −10f(2x) + 16f(x)∥≤˜ψ(x)
(3.136)
for all x ∈G. Let g1 : G →X be a function deﬁned by g1(x) := f(2x) −8f(x) for all
x ∈G. From Eq. [3.136], we conclude that
∥g1(2x) −2g1(x)∥≤˜ψ(x)

additive. If A′ is another additive function satisfying Eq. [3.120], then

conclude that

then A is the unique additive function and C is the unique cubic function satisfying
Eq. [3.154].
Proof. Let ℓ= 1. By Theorems 3.3.4 and 3.3.5, there exist an additive function
A0 : G →X and a cubic function C0 : G →X such that
∥f(2x) −8f(x) −A0(x)∥≤1
|2|ψa(x),
∥f(2x) −2f(x) −C0(x)∥≤

for all x ∈G. So we obtain Eq. [3.152] by letting A(x) = −1/6A0(x) and C(x) =
1/6C0(x) for all x ∈G.
To prove the uniqueness property of A and C, let C′, A′ : G →X be another
additive and cubic functions satisfying Eq. [3.152]. Let A = A −A′ and C = C −C′.
Hence,

Proof. Let ℓ= 1. It follows from Eq. [3.119] and using the evenness of f that

(f(2x) −4f(x))
 ≤ϕ(0, x)

∥f(4x) −20f(2x) + 64f(x)∥≤˜ϕ(x)
(3.171)
for all x ∈G. Let h1 : G →X be a function deﬁned by h1(x) := f(2x) −16f(x) for all

∥h1(2x) −4h1(x)∥≤˜ϕ(x)

quadratic. The rest of the proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.3.4. For ℓ= −1,
we can prove the theorem by a similar technique.

of (ring) homomorphisms in Banach algebras. Since then, the topic of approximate
homomorphisms has been studied by a number of mathematicians: see [7, 40, 41] and
references therein.
Let A1 be a subalgebra of Banach algebra A. A function f : A1 →A is called a
derivation if and only if it satisﬁes the functional equations
d(x + y) = d(x) + d(y),
d(xy) = xd(y) + d(x)y
for all x, y ∈A1.
Theorem 4.1.1 (Bourgin [38]). Let ε and δ be nonnegative real numbers. Then
every mapping f of a Banach algebra A with an identity element onto a Banach algebra
B with an identity element satisfying
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤ε
(4.1)
and
∥f(x · y) −f(x)f(y)∥≤δ
(4.2)
for all x, y ∈A, is a ring homomorphism of A onto B.
Badora [40] gave a simple proof of the following generalization of the Bourgin’s
result.

Theorem 4.1.2 (Badora [40]). Let R be a ring, let B be a Banach algebra and let
ε and δ be nonnegative real numbers. Assume that f : R →B satisﬁes Eqs. [4.1] and
(4.2) for all x, y ∈R. Then there exists a unique ring homomorphism h : R →B
such that
∥f(x) −h(x)∥≤ε
(4.3)
for all x ∈R. Moreover,


= 0,

f(x) −h(x)

· b = 0,
(4.4)
for all x ∈R and all b from the algebra generated by h(R).
Proof. The Hyers theorem (Theorem 2.1.1) shows that there exists an additive
function h : R →B such that
∥f(x) −h(x)∥≤ε
for all x ∈R. Now we only need to show that h is a multiplicative function. Our
inequality follows that
∥f(nx) −h(nx)∥≤ε
for all x ∈R and n ∈N. By the additivity of h it is easy to see that then

for all x ∈R and n ∈N, which means that
h(x) = lim
n→∞

nf(nx)
(4.5)
for all x ∈R. Let
r(x, y) = f(x · y) −f(x)f(y)
for all x, y ∈R. Then, using inequality (4.2), we get
lim
n→∞r(nx, y) = 0
(4.6)
for all x, y ∈R. Applying Eqs. [4.5] and (4.6), we have
h(x · y) = lim

for all x, y ∈R. The result of our calculation is the following functional equation
h(x · y) = h(x)f(y)
(4.7)
for all x, y ∈R. From this equation by the additivity of h, we have
h(x)f(ny) = h

x · (ny)

= h

(nx) · y

= h(nx)f(y) = nh(x)f(y)
for all x, y ∈R and n ∈N. Therefore,
h(x)1
nf(ny) = h(x)f(y)
for all x, y ∈R and n ∈N. Sending n to inﬁnity, by Eq. [4.5], we see that
h(x)h(y) = h(x)f(y)
(4.8)
for all x, y ∈R. Combining this formula with Eq. [4.7] we have that h is a
multiplicative function which is the desired conclusion.
To prove the uniqueness property of h, assume that h∗is another ring homomor-
phism with
∥f(x) −h∗(x)∥≤ε
for all x ∈R. Since both h and h∗are additive, we deduce that
n∥h(x) −h∗(x)∥= ∥h(nx) −h∗(nx)∥≤2ε,
so that
∥h(x) −h∗(x)∥≤2ε
n
for all x ∈R and n ∈N. Letting n to inﬁnity we ﬁnd that h(x) = h∗(x) for all x ∈R.
Moreover, from Eq. [4.2] we get
lim
n→∞
1
nr(x, ny) = 0
for all x, y ∈R. Thus, by Eq. [4.5], we deduce that
h(x · y) = lim

for all x, y ∈R. Hence, with regard to Eq. [4.8],
f(x)h(y) = h(x · y) = h(x)h(y) = h(x)f(y)
for all x, y ∈R. This identity leads to
h(x) ·

f(y)h(y)

· h(x) = 0,
(4.9)
for all x, y ∈R, which shows Eq. [4.8] and completes the proof of Theorem 4.1.1.
In particular, using ε(∥x∥p +∥y∥p) and δ(∥x∥q∥y∥q) instead of ε and δ, respectively,
for ε, δ ≥0 and some real numbers p, q in the main theorem, one gets the following
corollary as a consequence of Rassias theorem (Theorem 2.2.1).
Corollary 4.1.3 (Badora [40]). Let A be a normed algebra and let B be a Banach
algebra. Moreover, let ε and δ be nonnegative real numbers and let p and q be a real
numbers such that p, q < 1 or p, q > 1. Assume that f : A →B satisﬁes the system of
functional inequalities
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤ε(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p)
(4.10)
and
∥f(x · y) −f(x)f(y)∥≤δ(∥x∥q∥y∥q)
(4.11)
for all x, y ∈A. Then there exists a unique ring homomorphism h : A →B and a
constant k such that
∥f(x) −h(x)∥≤Kε∥x∥p
(4.12)
for all x ∈A.
Remark 4.1.4 (Badora [40]). Under the hypothesis of Corollary 4.1.3 for real
Banach algebras, if we assume that, for each ﬁxed x ∈A and for all t ∈R, the function
t 	→f(tx) is continuous then, by the Rassias theorem, the additive mapping h is linear,
so h is an algebra homomorphism.
Badora also proved the stability (in the sense of Hyers) of derivations in Banach
algebras.
Theorem 4.1.5 (Badora [42]). Let A1 be a closed subalgebra of a Banach algebra
A. Assume that f : A1 →A satisﬁes
∥f(x + y) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤δ
(x, y ∈A1)
and
∥f(xy) −xf(x) −f(x)y)∥≤ε
(x, y ∈A1)

Stability of functional equations in Banach algebras
73
for some constants δ, ε ≥0. Then there exists a unique derivation d : A1 →A such
that
∥f(x) −d(x)∥≤δ
(x ∈A1).
Furthermore,
x(f(y) −h(y)) = (f(y) −h(y))x = 0
(4.13)
for all x, y ∈A1.
Let X be a Banach bimodule over a Banach algebra A. Recall that X ⊕1 A is a
Banach algebra equipped with the following ℓ1-norm
∥(x, a)∥= ∥x∥+ ∥a∥
(a ∈A, x ∈X)
and the product
(x1, a1)(x2, a2) = (x1 · a2 + a1 · x2, a1a2)
(a1, a2 ∈A, x1, x2 ∈X).
The algebra X ⊕1A is called a module extension Banach algebra. We also deﬁne (norm
decreasing) projection maps π1 : X ⊕1 A →X and π2 : X ⊕1 A →A by (x, b) 	→x
and (x, b) 	→b, respectively. We refer the reader to [43] for more information on
Banach modules and to [44] for details on module extensions. The following theorem
may be regarded as an extension of Theorem 4.1.5.
Theorem 4.1.6. Let ε, δ > 0. Let A be a Banach algebra and let X be a Banach
A-bimodule. Suppose that a function f : A →X satisﬁes
∥f(a + b) −f(a) −f(b)∥≤ε
(4.14)
and
∥f(ab) −f(a)b −af(b)∥≤δ
for all a, b ∈A. Then there exists a unique derivation D : A →X such that
∥f(a) −D(a)∥≤ε
(a ∈A).
Moreover, we have
b(f(a) −D(a)) = (f(a) −D(a))b = 0
(a, b ∈A).
(4.15)
Proof. Let us deﬁne the mapping ϕf : A →X ⊕1 A by a 	→(f(a), a). We have
∥ϕf (a + b) −ϕf (a) −ϕf (b)∥
= ∥(f(a + b), a + b) −(f(a), a) −(f(b), b)∥

74
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
= ∥(f(a + b) −f(a) −f(b), 0)∥
= ∥f(a + b) −f(a) −f(b)∥≤ε
and similarly
∥ϕf (ab) −ϕf (a)ϕf (b)∥≤δ
for all a, b ∈A. It follows from Theorem 4.1.1 that there exists a unique ring
homomorphism ϕ : A →X ⊕1 A such that
∥ϕ(a) −ϕf (a)∥≤ε
(a ∈A).
(4.16)
Moreover,
(x, b)(ϕ(a) −ϕf (a)) = (ϕ(a) −ϕf (a))(x, b) = 0
(4.17)
for all a ∈A, and all (x, b) in the algebra generated by ϕ(A).
It follows from Eq. [4.16] that
∥(π2 ◦ϕf )(na) −(π2 ◦ϕ)(na)∥≤∥ϕf (na) −ϕ(na)∥≤ε
(4.18)
for all n ∈N, a ∈A. By the additivity of mappings under consideration
(π2 ◦ϕ)(na) = n(π2 ◦ϕ)(a)
and
(π2 ◦ϕf )(na) = π2(f(na), na) = na,
whence, by Eq. [4.18],
∥a −(π2 ◦ϕ)(a)∥≤1
nε
(4.19)
for all n ∈N, a ∈A. By letting n tend to ∞in Eq. [4.19], we obtain
(π2 ◦ϕ)(a) = a
(a ∈A).
(4.20)
Hence,
(π1 ◦ϕ)(ab), ab = π1(ϕ(ab)), π2(ϕ(ab)) = ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b)

for all a, b ∈A. Put D := π1 ◦ϕ. Then it follows from Eq. [4.21] that D is a derivation
from A into X. It follows from Eq. [4.16] that
∥D(a) −f(a)∥= ∥π1(ϕ(a)) −π1(ϕf (a))∥≤∥ϕ(a) −ϕf (a)∥≤ε
for all a ∈A.
To prove the uniqueness of D, assume that D∗is another derivation from A into X
satisfying
∥D∗(a) −f(a)∥≤ε
(a ∈A).
Then
∥D(a) −D∗(a)∥= 1

for all a ∈A, n ∈N. By letting n →∞in the last inequality, we conclude that
D(a) = D∗(a) for all a ∈A.

Remark 4.1.7. To achieve an algebra homomorphism, ie, a homogeneous ring
homomorphism, one can replace inequality (4.14) by
∥f(λa + b) −λf(a) −f(b)∥≤ε
where λ ∈{z ∈C : |z| = 1} and a, b ∈A. Then a standard argument shows that D
turns into a linear derivation.

76
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
We now present two superstability results concerning derivations.
Corollary 4.1.8. Let ε, δ > 0. Let A be a Banach algebra and let X be a Banach
A-bimodule without order, ie, Ax = 0 or xA = 0 implies that x = 0, where x ∈X.
Suppose that a function f : A →X satisﬁes
∥f(a + b) −f(a) −f(b)∥≤ε
and
∥f(ab) −f(a)b −af(b)∥≤δ
for all a, b ∈A. Then f is a derivation.
Proof. Due to X is a Banach A-bimodule without order, Eq. [4.15] in Theorem 4.1.5
implies that f = d is a derivation.
Corollary 4.1.9. Let ε, δ > 0. Let A be a Banach algebra with a bounded
approximate identity. Suppose that a function f : A →A satisﬁes
∥f(a + b) −f(a) −f(b)∥≤ε
and
∥f(ab) −f(a)b −af(b)∥≤δ
for all a, b ∈A. Then f is a derivation.
Proof. This follows from Corollary 4.1.8, since every Banach algebra with an
approximate unit, as a Banach bimodule over itself, is without order.
Similarly, we can use Theorem 4.1.1 to prove the Hyers-Ulam stability of deriva-
tions as follows.
Theorem 4.1.10. Let ε, δ > 0, and let p, q be real numbers such that p, q < 1, or
p, q > 1. Let A be a Banach algebra and let X be a Banach A-bimodule. Suppose that
a function f : A →X satisﬁes
∥f(a + b) −f(a) −f(b)∥≤ε(∥a∥p + ∥b∥p)
and
∥f(ab) −f(a)b −af(b)∥≤δ(∥a∥q∥b∥q)
for all a, b ∈A. Then there exists a unique derivation D : A →X and a constant k
such that
∥f(a) −D(a)∥≤kε∥x∥p
for all a ∈A.

The following counterexample, which is a modiﬁcation of Luminet’s example (see
[45]), shows that this result is failed for p = 1.

for all x ∈R. Then
∥f(a + b) −f(a) −f(b)∥≤ε(∥a∥+ ∥b∥)
and
∥f(ab) −f(a)b −af(b)∥≤δ(∥a∥2∥b∥2)
for some δ > 0, ε > 0 and all a, b ∈X; see [40]. Therefore, f satisﬁes the conditions
of Theorem 4.1.10 with p = 1, q = 2. There is, however, no derivation D : X →X
and no constant k > 0 such that
∥f(a) −D(a)∥≤kε∥a∥
(a ∈X).
Against this, assume that there exist a derivation D : X →X and a constant k > 0
such that
∥f(a) −D(a)∥≤kε∥a∥
(a ∈X).
Representing D as a 3 × 3 matrix [Dij], we infer that D21 : R →R is an additive
mapping such that
|ϕ(x) −D21(x)| ≤kε|x|

78
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
for all x ∈R. From the continuity of ϕ, it follows that D21 is bounded on some
neighborhood of zero. Then there exists a ﬁxed c such that D21(x) = cx, for all x ∈R.
Hence,
|x ln(x) −cx| ≤kεx
for x > 1, whence
| ln(x) −c| ≤kε
for x > 1, which yields a contradiction.

N is a ﬁxed integer with n

point theorem to investigate the stability by using contractively subhomogeneous and
expansively superhomogeneous functions for Lie (α, β, γ )-derivations associated to
the generalized Cauchy-Jensen functional equation (4.24) on Lie C∗-algebras. We
observe that in case n = 2, Eq. [4.24] yields Cauchy-additive equation f(x1 + x2) =
f(x1) + f(x2).
Following [49], a C-linear mapping D : A →A is a called a Lie (α, β, γ )-
derivation of A, if there exist α, β, γ ∈C such that
αD[x, y] = β[D(x), y] + γ [x, D(y)]
for all x, y ∈A.
Let k be a ﬁxed positive integer. We recall that a function ρ
:
A
→
B,
having a domain A and a codomain (B, ≤) that are both closed under addition is
called:
•
a contractively subadditive function if there exists a constant L with 0 < L < 1 such that
ρ(x + y) ≤L (ρ(x) + ρ(y));
•
an expansively superadditive function if there exists a constant L with 0 < L < 1 such that
ρ(x + y) ≥1
L (ρ(x) + ρ(y));
•
a homogeneous function of degree k if ρ(λx) = λkρ(x) (for the case of k = 1, the
corresponding function is simply said to be homogeneous);
•
a contractively subhomogeneous function of degree k if thereexists a constant L with
0 < L < 1 such that ρ(λx) ≤Lλkρ(x);
•
an expansively superhomogeneous function of degree k if there exists a constant L with
0 < L < 1 such that ρ(λx) ≥
λk
L ρ(x), for all x, y ∈A and all positive integer
λ > 1.
Remark 4.2.6. If ρ is contractively subadditive and expansively superadditive
separately, then ρ is contractively subhomogeneous (:ℓ

1) and expansively
superhomogeneous (:ℓ= −1), respectively, and so

Then (W, d) is complete. Now we consider the mapping Λ : W →W deﬁned by

for all g ∈W and x ∈A.
Let g, h ∈W and let C ∈[0, ∞) be an arbitrary constant with d(g, h) < C. From the
deﬁnition of d, we have
∥g(x) −h(x)∥
φ (x, . . . , x)

This means Λ is a strictly contractive self-mapping of W, with the Lipschitz

Substituting x1, . . ., xn

we obtain

additive by Lemma 4.2.9. Letting x1 = x and x2 = · · · = xn = 0 in last equality,
we obtain D(μx) = μD(x). Now, by using Lemma 4.2.10, we infer that the mapping

Therefore, the mapping D ∈W is a unique Lie (α, β, γ )-derivation on Lie
C∗-algebra A satisfying Eq. [4.31].
Theorem 4.2.12 (Eshaghi and Khodaei [48]). Assume that there exists a contrac-

obtain
∥nf(2x) −2nf(x)∥≤ϕ (x, . . . , x, 0, 0)
(4.35)
for all x ∈A. We introduce the same deﬁnitions for W and d as in the proof of
Theorem 4.2.11 (by replacing φ by ϕ) such that (W, d) becomes a complete metric
space. Let Λ : W →W be the mapping deﬁned by

This implies that inequality (4.34) holds.

Stability problem on C ∗-ternary algebras
Ternary algebraic operations were considered in the 19th century by several math-
ematicians and physicists such as Cayley [52] who introduced the notions of cubic
matrix, which in turn was generalized by Kapranov el al. [53]. The simplest example
of such nontrivial ternary operation is given by the following composition rule:
{a, b, c}ijk =

l,m,n
anilbljmcmkn
(i, j, k, . . . = 1, 2, . . ., N).
Ternary structures and their generalization, the so-called n-ary structures, raise certain
hopes in view of their applications in physics. Some signiﬁcant physical applications
are as follows (see [54, 55]):
(i)
The algebra of “nonions” generated by two matrices,

⎞
⎠,
(ω = e2Πi/3)
was introduced by Sylvester as a ternary analog of Hamilton’s quaternions (cf. [56]).
(ii)
A natural ternary composition of 4-vectors in the four-dimensional Minkowskian space
time M4 can be deﬁned as an example of a ternary operation:
(X, Y, Z) 	−→U(X, Y, Z) ∈M4
with the resulting 4-vector Uμ deﬁned via its components in a given coordinate system as
follows:
Uμ(X, Y, Z) = gμσ ησνλρXνYλZρ,
μ, ν, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3,
where gμσ is the metric tensor and ησνλρ is the canonical volume element of M4 (see [55])
(iii) The quark model inspired a particular brand of ternary algebraic systems. The “Nambu
mechanics” are based on such structures (see [57, 58]). Quarks apparently couple by
packs of 3.
There are also some applications, although still hypothetical, in the fractional
quantum Hall effect, nonstandard statistics, supersymmetric theory, Yang-Baxter
equation, etc. (cf. [53, 56, 59]). Following the terminology of Ref. [60], a nonempty
set G with a ternary operation [·, ·, ·] : G3 →G is called a ternary groupoid and
is denoted by (G, [·, ·, ·]). The ternary groupoid (G, [·, ·, ·]) is called commutative if

Stability of functional equations in Banach algebras
87
[x1, x2, x3] = [xσ(1), xσ(2), xσ(3)] for all x1, x2, x3 ∈G and all permutations σ of
{1, 2, 3}. If a binary operation ◦is deﬁned on G such that [x, y, z] = (x ◦y) ◦z for all
x, y, z ∈G, then we say that [·, ·, ·] is derived from ◦. We say that (G, [·, ·, ·]) is a ternary
semigroup if the operation [·, ·, ·] is associative, ie, if [[x, y, z], u, v] = [x, [y, z, u], v] =
[x, y, [z, u, v]] holds for all x, y, z, u, v ∈G (see [61]).
As it is extensively discussed in [62], the full description of a physical system
S implies the knowledge of three basis ingredients: the set of the observables, the
set of the states and the dynamics that describe the time evolution of the system
by means of the time dependence of the expectation value of a given observable
on a given statue. Originally the set of the observables was considered to be a C∗-
algebra [63]. In many applications, however, this was shown not to be the must
convenient choice, and the C∗-algebra was replaced by a von Neumann algebra,
because the role of the representation turns out to be crucial mainly when long-range
interactions are involved (see [64] and references therein). Here we used a different
algebraic structure. A C∗-ternary algebra is a complex Banach space A, equipped with
a ternary product (x, y, z) ↣[x, y, z] of A3 into A, which is C-linear in the outer
variables, conjugate C-linear in the middle variable, and associative in the sense that
[x, y, [z, w, v]] = [x, [w, z, y], v] = [[x, y, z], w, v], and satisﬁes ∥[x, y, z]∥≤∥x∥·∥y∥·∥z∥
and ∥[x, x, x]∥= ∥x∥3. If a C∗-ternary algebra (A, [·, ·, ·]) has an identity, ie, an element
e ∈A such that x = [x, e, e] = [e, e, x] for all x ∈A, then it is routine to verify that A,
endowed with x ◦y := [x, e, y] and x∗:= [e, x, e], is a unital C∗-algebra. Conversely, if
(A, ◦) is a unital C∗-algebra, then [x, y, z] := x◦y∗◦z makes A into a C∗-ternary algebra.
A C-linear mapping H : A →B is called a C∗-ternary algebra homomorphism if
H([x, y, z]) = [H(x), H(y), H(z)]
for all x, y, z ∈A.

generalized metric on X:
d(h, g) := inf{C ∈R+ : ∥g(x) −h(x)∥≤Cφ(x, 0, 0), ∀x ∈A}.
It is easy to show that (X, d) is complete. Now we deﬁne the linear mapping J :
X →X by
J(h)(x) = 1
2h(2x)
for all x ∈A. It is easy to show that d(J(g), J(h)) ≤Ld(g, h) for all g, h ∈X (see

proof of Theorem 4.3.1, one can show that there exists a unique J∗-homomorphism
h : A →B satisfying
∥f(x) −h(x)∥≤
L
1 −Lφ(x, 0, 0)
(4.42)
for all x ∈A.
For the case φ(x, y, z) := θ(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p + ∥zp) (where θ is a nonnegative real
number and p > 1), there exists a unique J∗-homomorphism h : A →B satisfying
∥f(x) −h(x)∥≤
2pθ
2 −2p ∥x∥p
for all x ∈A.
The case in which p = 1 was excluded in Corollary 4.3.2 and Remark 4.3.3. Indeed,
the results are not valid when p = 1. Here we use Gajda’s example [10] to give a
counter-example.
Proposition 4.3.4 (Eshaghi et al. [41]). Let φ : C →C be deﬁned by
φ(x) :=
 x,
for |x| < 1,
1,
for |x| ≤1.
Consider the function f : C →C given by the formula
f(x) :=
∞

n=0
2−nφ(2nx).
Let
Dμf(x, y, z) = μf
x + z¯zz + y

+ μf
x + z¯zz −y


−f(μx) −μf(z)f(z)f(z)
for all μ ∈T and all x, y, z ∈A. Then f satisﬁes
|Dμf(x, y, z)| ≤36(|x| + |y| + |z|)
(4.43)

Stability of functional equations in Banach algebras
91
for all μ ∈T and all x, y, z ∈A, and the range of |f(x) −A(x)|/|x| for x ̸= 0 is
unbounded for each additive function A : C →C.
Proof. It is clear that f is bounded by 2 on C. If |x|+|y|+|z| = 0 or |x|+|y|+|z| ≤1,
then
|Dμf(x, y, z)| ≤14 ≤14(|x| + |y| + |z|).
Now suppose that 0 < |x| + |y| + |z| < 1. Then there exists an integer k ≥0
such that
1
2k+1 ≤|x| + |y| + |z| ≤1
2k .
(4.44)
Therefore,
2m|x + z¯zz + y|, 2m|μx|, 2m|z| < 1
for all m = 0, 1, . . ., k −1. From the deﬁnition of f and Eq. [4.44], we have
|f(z)| ≤k|z| +
∞

n=k
2−n|φ(2nz)| ≤k|z| + 2
2k ,
|Dμf(x, y, z)| ≤|z|3 + 6

4k
|z| + 8
2k
≤20|z| + 16(|x| + |y| + |z|)
≤36(|x| + |y| + |z|).
Therefore, f satisﬁes Eq. [4.43]. Let A : C →C be an additive function such that
|f(x) −A(x)| ≤β|x|
for all x ∈C. Then there exists a constant c ∈C such that A(x) = cx for all rational
numbers x. So we have
|f(x)| ≤(β + |c|)|x|
(4.45)
for all rational numbers x. Let m ∈N with m > β + |c|. If x is a rational number in
(0, 21−m), then 2nx ∈(0, 1) for all n = 0, 1, . . ., m −1. So
f(x) ≥
m−1

n=0
2−nφ(2nx) = mx > (β + |c|)x,
which contradicts Eq. [4.45].

Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
Now we establish the superstability of J∗-homomorphisms as follows.
Theorem 4.3.5 (Eshaghi et al. [41]). Let |r| > 1, and let f : A →B be a mapping
satisfying f(rx) = rf(x) for all x ∈A. Let φ : A3 →[0, ∞) be a mapping such that
∥μf(x + zz∗z + y) + μf(x −y) −2f(μx) −μf(z)f(z)∗f(z)∥
≤φ(x, y, z)
(4.46)
for all μ ∈T and all x, y, z ∈A. If there exists a constant 0 < L < 1 such that
φ(x, y, z) ≤|r|Lφ
x
r , y
r , z
r

for all x, y, z ∈A, then f is a J∗-homomorphism.
Proof. By using equation f(rx) = rf(x) and Eq. [4.46], we have f(0) = 0 and
∥μf(x + y) + μf(x −y) −2f(μx)∥≤|r|−nφ(rnx, rny, 0),
∥f(zz∗z) −f(z)f(z)∗f(z)∥≤|r|−3nφ(0, 0, rnz)
(4.47)
for all x, y ∈A and all integers n. It follows from φ(x, y, z) ≤|r|Lφ( x
r , y
r , z
r) that
lim
n→∞|r|−nφ(rnx, rny, rnz) = 0
for all x, y, z ∈A. Hence, we get from Eq. [4.47] that
f(x + y) + μf(x −y) = 2f(μx),
f(zz∗z) = f(z)f(z)∗f(z)
for all μ ∈T and all x, y, z ∈A. So f is additive and f(μx) = μf(x) for all
μ ∈T and all x ∈A. By Lemma 4.2.10, f is C-linear and we conclude that f is a
J∗-homomorphism.
Theorem 4.3.6 (Eshaghi et al. [41]). Let 0 < |r| < 1, and let f : A →B be a
mapping satisfying f(rx) = rf(x) for all x ∈A. Let φ : A3 →[0, ∞) be a mapping
satisfying Eq. [4.46]. If there exists a constant 0 < L < 1 such that |r|φ(x, y, z) ≤
Lφ (rx, ry, rz) for all x, y, z ∈A, then f is a J∗-homomorphism.
Corollary 4.3.7 (Eshaghi et al. [41]). Let 0 < |r| ̸= 1, p ∈(0, 1), and δ, θ ≥0 be
real numbers. Suppose that f : A →B is a mapping satisfying f(rx) = rf(x) for all
x ∈A and inequality

|r| > 1, L = |r|p−1 and for 0 < |r| < 1, let L = |r|1−p. Then we get the desired
result by Theorem 4.3.5 (for |r| > 1) and Theorem 4.3.6 (for 0 < |r| < 1).

4.3.2
The stability of J∗-derivations
Let H, K be two Hilbert spaces and let B(H, K) be the space of all bounded operators
from H into K. By a J∗-algebra, we mean a closed subspace A of B(H, K) such that
xx∗x ∈A whenever x ∈A. Many familiar spaces are J∗-algebras [66]. Of course
J∗-algebras are not algebras in the ordinary sense. However, from one point of view
they may be considered a generalization of C∗-algebras; see [66–68]. In particular, any
Hilbert space may be thought of as a J∗-algebra identiﬁed with L(H, C). Also, any
C∗-algebra in B(H) is a J∗-algebra. Other important examples of J∗-algebras are the
so-called Cartan factors of types I, II, III, and IV. A J∗-derivation on a J∗-algebra A is
deﬁned to be a C-linear mapping d : A →A such that
d(aa∗a) = d(a)a∗a + a(d(a))∗a + aa∗d(a)
for all a ∈A. In particular, every J∗-derivation on a C∗-algebra is a J∗-derivation.
Eshaghi et al. [69] investigated the stability and superstability of J∗-derivations in
J∗-algebras for the generalized Jensen-type functional equation

Theorem 4.3.9 (Eshaghi et al. [69]). Let r, s ∈(1, ∞), and let D : A →A be
a mapping for which D(sa) = sD(a) for all a ∈A. Suppose there exists a function

of D, we obtain that μD(a) = D(μa) for all a ∈A and all μ ∈T. So it is easy to show
that D is C-linear (see, for example, Theorem 1 of [47]).

General solutions of some functional equations
Let R be a unital ring and M be a (two-sided) module on R. A function M : R →R is
said to be a multiplicative (3-multiplicative) function if
M(ab) = M(a)M(b)
or
(M(abc) = M(a)M(b)M(c))
for all a, b, c ∈R. It is easy to see that every multiplicative function is 3-multiplicative,
and the converse is not true. A mapping M

multiplicative if

M(ab + ba) = M(a)M(b) + M(b)M(a)

D(ab) = D(a)b + aD(b)
for all a, b ∈R and D : R →M is said to be a Jordan multiplicative derivation if
D(ab + ba) = D(a)b + aD(b) + D(b)a + bD(a)
for all a, b ∈R. The functional equation
f(x + y + xy) = f(x) + f(y) + f(x)f(y)
is called Pompeiu’s functional equation [70, 71]. In this section, we show that if f :
R →R is a Pompeiu function, then f satisﬁes the functional equation
f(x + y + z + xy + xz + yz + xyz) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) + f(x)f(y)
+ f(x)f(z) + f(y)f(z) + f(x)f(y)f(z).
(4.58)
Moreover, we show that a function f : R →R satisﬁes
f(x + y + xy + yx) = f(x) + f(y) + f(x)f(y) + f(y)f(x)

Let X be a Banach bimodule over a Banach algebra A. Recall that X ⊕1 A is a
Banach algebra equipped with the ℓ1-norm
∥(x, a)∥= ∥x∥+ ∥a∥
(a ∈A, x ∈X)
and the product
(x1, a1)(x2, a2) = (x1 · a2 + a1 · x2, a1a2)
(a1, a2 ∈A, x1, x2 ∈X).
The algebra X ⊕1 A is called a module extension Banach algebra. We refer the reader
to [43] for more information on Banach modules and to [44, 72] for details on module
extensions. We use this notion to ﬁnd an equivalent functional equation for Pompeiu’s
functional equation.
4.4.1
A sufﬁcient condition for Pompeiu’s functional equation
It is known that f : R →R is a Pompeiu’s function if and only if there exists a
multiplicative function M : R →R such that
f(x) = M(x + 1) −1,
where 1 is the unite element of R. Then by part (ii) of the following theorem, one
can see that Eq. [4.58] is a sufﬁcient condition for Pompeiu functional equation.
We shall show that Eq. [4.58] is not a necessary condition for Pompeiu’s functional
equation.
Theorem 4.4.1.
(i)
If f : R →R holds in functional equation (4.58), then the function M : R →R deﬁned by
M(x) = f(x −1) + 1(x ∈R) is a 3-multiplicative function on R.
(ii) If M : R →R is a multiplicative function, then the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) =
M(x + 1) −1(x ∈R) holds in Eq. [4.58].
Proof.
(i)
Let f : R →R holds in Eq. [4.58] and put M(x) = f(x −1) + 1 for all x ∈R. We have
M(x)M(y)M(z) = (f(x −1) + 1)(f (y −1) + 1)(f (z −1) + 1)
= f(x −1)f(y −1)f(z −1) + f (x −1)f (y −1)
+ f(x −1)f(z −1) + f(y −1)f (z −1)

102

+ f(x −1) + f(y −1) + f(z −1) + 1
= f[(x −1)(y −1)(z −1) + (x −1)(y −1)
+ (x −1)(z −1) + (y −1)(z −1)
+ (x −1) + (y −1) + (z −1)] + 1
= f(xyz −1) + 1
= M(xyz)
for all x, y, z ∈R. This means that M : R →R is 3-multiplicative.
(ii) Let M : R →R be a multiplicative function and deﬁne f : R →R by f (x) = M(x + 1) −1
for all x ∈R. We know that f is a Pompeiu function. Then we have
f(xy + x + y) = f(x)f(y) + f(x) + f(y),
f(xz + x + z) = f(x)f(z) + f(x) + f(z),
f(yz + y + z) = f(y)f(z) + f(y) + f(z)
for all x, y, z ∈R. It follows that
f(x)f(y)f(z) = (M(x + 1) −1)(M(y + 1) −1)(M(z + 1) −1)
= M(x + 1)M(y + 1)M(z + 1) −M(x + 1)M(y + 1)
−M(x + 1)M(z + 1) −M(y + 1)M(z + 1) + M(x + 1)
+ M(y + 1) + M(z + 1) −1
= M[(x + 1)(y + 1)(z + 1)] −M[(x + 1)(y + 1)]
−M[(x + 1)(z + 1)] −M[(y + 1)(z + 1)] + M(x + 1)
+ M(y + 1) + M(z + 1) −1
= [M(xyz + xy + xz + yz + x + y + z + 1) −1]
−[M(xy + x + y + 1) −1] −[M(xz + x + z + 1) −1]
−[M(yz + y + z + 1) −1] + M(x + 1) −1
+ M(y + 1) −1 + M(z + 1) −1
= [f(xyz + xy + xz + yz + x + y + z)] −[f (xy + x + y)]
−[f(xz + x + z)] −[f(yz + y + z)] + f (x) + f (y) + f (z)
= [f(xyz + xy + xz + yz + x + y + z)] −[f (x)f (y) + f (x) + f (y)]
−[f(x)f(z) + f(x) + f(z)] −[f(y)f(z) + f (y) + f (z)]
+ f(x) + f(y) + f(z)
for all x, y, z ∈R. It follows that f holds in Eq. [4.58].
Note that the converse of (ii) is not true. To this end, deﬁne f : R →R by
f(x) = −x −2. It is easy to see that f satisﬁes Eq. [4.58] and that f is not a Pompeiu
function.

Let R be a unital ring such that 2 = 1 + 1 is invertible. Then we ﬁnd a solution for

4.4.3
Functional equation
f(x + y + xy) = f(x) + f(y) + f(x)y + xf(y)
Let R be a unital ring, M be a module on R and f : R →M be a function. Then we ﬁnd
a solution for functional equation
f(x + y + xy) = f(x) + f(y) + f(x)y + xf(y)
(4.60)
by using the multiplicative derivations from R into M. Moreover, by using Pompeiu’s
functional equation, we ﬁnd an equivalent for Eq. [4.60].
Theorem 4.4.3.
(i)
If f : R →M holds in functional equation (4.60), then the function D : R →M deﬁne by
D(x) := f(x −1) for all x ∈R is a multiplicative derivation on R.
(ii) If D : R →M is a multiplicative derivation and deﬁne f : R →M by f(x) := D(x + 1) for
all x ∈R, then f holds in Eq. [4.60].

105
Proof.
(i)
Let f : R →M holds in Eq. [4.60] and put D(x) := f(x −1) for all x ∈R. We have
D(x)y + xD(y) = (f(x −1))y + x(f(y −1))
= (f(x −1))y + x(f(y −1)) + f (x −1) −f (x −1)
+ f(y −1) −f(y −1)
= (f(x −1))(y −1) + (x −1)(f (y −1)) + f (x −1) + f (y −1)
= f[(x −1) + (y −1) + (x −1)(y −1)]
= f(xy −1)
= D(xy)
for all x, y ∈R. This means that D : R →M is a multiplicative derivation.
(ii) Let D : R →M be a multiplicative derivation and deﬁne f : R →M by f (x) := D(x + 1)
for all x ∈R. We show that f satisﬁes Eq. [4.60]. To this end, we have
f(x)y + xf (y) = D(x + 1)y + xD(y + 1)
= D(x + 1)(y + 1) + (x + 1)D(y + 1) −D(x + 1) −D(y + 1)
= D[(x + 1)(y + 1)] −D(x + 1) −D(y + 1)
= D[xy + x + y + 1] −D(x + 1) −D(y + 1)
= f(xy + x + y) −f(x) −f(y)
for all x, y ∈R. This means that f satisﬁes Eq. [4.3].
Theorem 4.4.4. The mapping f : A →X holds in functional equation (4.60), if
and only if the mapping ϕf : A →X ⊕1 A deﬁned by ϕf (a) := (f(a), a), is a Pompeiu
function. Moreover, f is continuous if and only if ϕf is continuous.
Proof. We have
ϕf (a+b+ab) = (f(a+b+ab), a+b+ab) = (f(a)+f(b)+f(a)b+af(b), a+b+ab)
for all a, b ∈A. On the other hand, we have
ϕf (a)ϕf (b) = (f(a), a)(f(b), b) = (f(a)b + af(b), ab)
for all a, b ∈A. It follows that
ϕf (a + b + ab) = (f(a), a) + (f(b), b) + (f(a)b + af(b), ab)
= ϕf (a) + ϕf (b) + ϕf (a)ϕf (b)
for all a, b ∈A. This means that ϕf is a Pompeiu function. The continuity property
follows easily from deﬁnitions.

Some open problems
According to Section 4.4, we raise some questions about new functional equations.
Problem 4.5.1. We know that generalized homomorphisms and generalized deriva-
tions are deﬁned in subject categories of algebra and analysis. We can deﬁne the
generalized Pompeiu function as follows: a mapping F : R →R is said to be a
generalized Pompeiu function if there exists a Pompeiu function f : R →R such
that F(a + b + ab) = F(a) + F(b) + f(a)F(b) for all a, b ∈R. What is the solution and
stability of generalized Pompeiu’s functional equation?
Similarly, we can deﬁne and ask about solution of the generalized form of functional
equation (4.60).
Problem 4.5.2. Let n
∈
N. In subject categories of algebra and analysis,
one can ﬁnd the deﬁnitions of n-homomorphisms, n-Jordan homomorphisms, and
n-derivations. We can deﬁne n-Pompeiu function as follows: a mapping f : R →R is
said to be an n-Pompeiu function if
f(a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an + a1a2a3 · · · an) = f(a1) + f(a2) + f(a) + f(a3)
+ · · · + f(an) + f(a1a2a3 · · · an)

for all a1, a2, a3, . . . , an ∈R. What is the solution and stability of n-Pompeiu’s
functional equation?
Similarly, we can deﬁne and ask about solution of the functional equation:
f(a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an + a1a2a3 · · · an)
= f(a1) + f(a2) + f(a) + f(a3) + · · · + f(an)

+ · · · + a1a2a3 · · · an−1f(an).
Problem 4.5.3. Recently, John Rassias and others [73] investigated the solution and
stability of a Hosszu-type functional inequality
f(x + y + xy) ≤f(x) + f(y) + f(xy)
(see also [74]). What is the solutions and stability property of the following functional
inequalities for arbitrary f, g, k, l, m, n : R →R?
f(x + y + z + xy + xz + yz + xyz) ≤f(x) + f(y) + f(z) + f(x)f(y)
+ f(x)f(z) + f(y)f(z) + f(x)f(y)f(z),
f(x + y + xy) ≤g(x) + h(y) + k(x)y + xl(y),
f(x + y + xy + yx) ≤g(x) + h(y) + k(x)l(y) + m(y)n(x)
and
f(x + y + xy + yx) ≤g(x) + h(y) + k(x)y + xl(y) + m(y)x + yn(x).
We know that R is commutative. Then the last two inequalities can be written as
f(x + y + 2xy) ≤g(x) + h(y) + k(x)l(y) + +m(y)n(x)
and
f(x + y + 2xy) ≤g(x) + h(y) + k(x)y + xl(y) + m(y)x + yn(x).
Problem 4.5.4. What is the solution of the functional equations
f(x + y + xy) = f(x) + f(y) + f(x)y
and
f(x + y + xy) = f(x) + f(y) + xf(y)?

Stability of functional equations in Banach algebras

Problem 4.5.5. What are the solutions of the functional inequalities
f(x + y + xy) ≤g(x) + h(y) + k(x)y
and
f(x + y + xy) ≤g(x) + h(y) + xk(y),

Problem 4.5.6. In Section 4.4, we see that functional equations (4.58), (4.59),

what are the solutions of these functional equations?

Introduction
The study on linear orthogonality preserving mappings can be considered as a part of
the theory of linear preservers. In the simplest case, for X and Y being real or complex
inner product spaces with the standard orthogonality relation ⊥, a mapping T : X →Y
which satisﬁes
x⊥y ⇒T(x)⊥f(y),
x, y ∈X
is called orthogonality preserving (o.p.). Now, if we replace the exact orthogonality
⊥by somehow deﬁned approximate orthogonality ⊥ε we obtain a larger class of
approximately orthogonality preserving (a.o.p.) mappings deﬁned by
x⊥y ⇒f(x)⊥εf(y),
x, y ∈X.
It can be proved that linear o.p. mappings are just similarities whereas linear a.o.p.
ones are, in a sense, approximate similarities. Moreover, it can be shown that each
linear a.o.p. mapping can be approximated by a linear o.p. one. Following the idea of
the stability of functional equations, we may speak about stability of the orthogonality
preserving property (see [75]).
The problem can be easily generalized from the realm of inner product spaces
to normed spaces, where the norm not necessarily comes from an inner product
and the orthogonality relation may be deﬁned in various ways. Another direction of
generalization is to replace the scalar-valued inner product by an inner product taking
values in some C∗-algebra, ie, in the realm of inner product (Hilbert) modules.
Since the o.p. mappings can be irregular, far from being continuous or linear. Thus,
in considerations that follow, we restrict ourselves to linear mappings only.
Theorem 5.1.1 (Chmieli´nski [75]). For a nonzero linear mapping T : X →Y the
following conditions are equivalent with some γ > 0:
1. T preserves orthogonality;
2. ∥T(x)∥= γ ∥x∥, x ∈X;
3. ⟨T(x)|T(y)⟩= γ 2⟨x|y⟩, x, y ∈X; and
4. |⟨T(x)|T(y)⟩| = γ 2|⟨x|y⟩|, x, y ∈X.

Now, let A be a C∗-algebra and let V, W be inner product A-modules. We may
consider A as a subalgebra of an algebra B(H) of all linear bounded operators on a
Hilbert space H. By K(H) we denote the subalgebra of compact operators. Iliševi´c and
Turnšek [76] proved the validity of Theorem 5.1.3 in this setting.
Theorem 5.1.2. For a C∗-algebra A with K(H) ⊂A ⊂B(H) and a nonzero
A-linear mapping T : V →W, the following conditions are equivalent (with some
γ > 0):
Theorem 5.1.3 (Chmieli´nski [77]). Let X and Y be inner product spaces and let
X be ﬁnite-dimensional. Then there exists a continuous mapping δ : [0, 1) →R+
such that limε→0+ δ(ε) = 0 and satisfying the following property. For each mapping
f : X →Y satisfying
|⟨f(x)|f(y)⟩| −⟨x|y⟩| ≤ε∥x∥∥y∥,
x, y ∈X,
there exists a linear isometry I : X →Y such that
∥f(x) −I(x)∥≤δ(ε)∥x∥,
x ∈X.
5.2
Orthogonal derivations in orthogonality Banach
algebras
Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78] investigated the stability and hyperstability of the
orthogonal derivations by using the alternative of ﬁxed point (Theorem 2.2.8). An
orthogonality space (X, ⊥) is a real vector space X with dim X ≥2 together with a
binary relation ⊥satisfying some axioms similar to the ones in [79].
There are several orthogonality notions on a real normed space such as Birkhoff-
James, Boussouis, (semi-)inner product, Singer, Carlsson, area, unitary-Boussouis,
Roberts, Pythagorean, isosceles, and Diminnie (see, eg, [80, 81]). Here, however, we
present the orthogonality concept introduced by J. Rätz [82]. This is given in the
following deﬁnition.
Suppose that X is a real vector space (or an algebra) with dim X ≥2 and ⊥is a
binary relation on X with the following properties:
(O1) totality of ⊥for zero: x ⊥0, 0 ⊥x for all x ∈X;
(O2) independence: if x, y ∈X −{0}, x ⊥y, then x, y are linearly independent;
(O3) homogeneity: if x, y ∈X, x ⊥y, then αx ⊥βy for all α, β ∈R; and
(O4) the Thalesian property: if P is a two-dimensional subspace (subalgebra) of X,
x ∈P and λ ∈R+, then there exists ux ∈P such that x ⊥ux and x+ux ⊥λx−ux.
The pair (X, ⊥) is called an orthogonality space (algebra). By an orthogonality
normed space (normed algebra), we mean an orthogonality space (algebra) having a
normed structure.
The orthogonal Cauchy functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y), x ⊥y in which
⊥is an abstract orthogonality relation was ﬁrst investigated in [79]. A generalized

version of Cauchy’s equation is the equation of Pexider type f1(x + y) = f2(x) + f3(y).
Jun et al. [83, 90] obtained the Hyers-Ulam stability of this Pexider equation.
Let (A, ⊥) be an orthogonality normed algebra and B be an A-bimodule. A mapping
d : A →B is an orthogonally ring derivation if d is an orthogonally additive mapping
satisfying
d(xy) = xd(y) + d(x)y
(5.1)
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y. Moreover, a mapping d : A →B is said to
be an orthogonally Jordan ring derivation if d is an orthogonally additive mapping
satisfying
d(xy + yx) = xd(y) + d(x)y + yd(x) + d(y)x
(5.2)
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y. In particular, we may deﬁne orthogonally derivations
associated to the Pexiderized Cauchy functional equation.
Deﬁnition 5.2.1 (Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78]). Let (A, ⊥) be an orthogonality
normed algebra and B be an A-bimodule and let f, g, h : A →B be mappings satisfying
the system
f(x + y) = g(x) + h(y),
f(xy) = xg(y) + h(x)y
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, then we call it an orthogonal Pexiderized ring derivation
system of equations. Moreover, if the mappings f, g, h satisfy the system
f(x + y) = g(x) + h(y),
f(xy + yx) = xg(y) + h(x)y + yg(x) + h(y)x
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, we call it an orthogonal Pexiderized Jordan ring derivation
system of equations.
In the following theorem, by applying the alternative of ﬁxed point (Theorem 2.2.8),
we will prove the Hyers-Ulam stability and hyperstability properties for the orthogonal
Pexider ring derivations.
Theorem 5.2.2 (Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78]). Let A be an orthogonality Banach
algebra and B a Banach A-bimodule. Suppose that f, g, h : A →B are mappings
fulﬁlling the system of functional inequalities
∥f(x + y) −g(x) −h(y)∥≤ϕ(x, y),
(5.3)
∥f(xy) −xg(y) −h(x)y∥≤φ(x, y),
(5.4)
where ϕ, φ : X × X →[0, ∞) are mappings such that

for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, where j ∈{−1, 1}. If f is an odd mapping, ϕ(0, 0) =
φ(0, 0) = 0 and there exists 0 < L = L(j) < 1 such that for any ﬁxed x ∈A and some

(5.8)
then there exists a unique orthogonally ring derivation d : A →B such that
∥f(x) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux),
∥g(x) −g(0) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux) + ϕ(x, 0),
∥h(x) −h(0) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux) + ϕ(0, x).
(5.9)
Proof. Let E = {e : A →B | e(0) = 0}. For any ﬁxed x ∈A and some ux ∈A
with x ⊥ux, deﬁne m : E × E →[0, ∞] by
m(e1, e2) = inf

K ∈R+ : ∥e1(x) −e2(x)∥≤Kψ(x, ux)

.
As usual, inf Ø = ∞. It is easy to see that (E, m) is a complete generalized metric
space. Let us consider the linear mapping T : E →E, Te(x) = 1
2j e(2jx) for all x ∈A.
T is a strictly contractive mapping with the Lipschitz constant L. Indeed, for given e1
and e2 in E such that m(e1, e2) < ∞and any K > 0 satisfying m(e1, e2) < K and any
ﬁxed x ∈A and some ux ∈A with uαx = αux (α ∈R) and x ⊥ux, we have

Put K = m(e1, e2) + 1
n for positive integers n. Then m(Te1, Te2) ≤L(m(e1, e2) + 1
n).
Letting n →∞gives
m(Te1, Te2) ≤Lm(e1, e2)
for all e1, e2 ∈E.
Since ϕ(0, 0) = φ(0, 0) = 0, putting x, y = 0 in Eqs. [5.3] and (5.4), we get
f(0) = 0,
g(0) + h(0) = 0.
(5.10)
For every x, y ∈A, x, y ⊥0. We can then put y = 0 and x = 0 in Eq. [5.3], respectively,
to obtain
∥f(x) −g(x) −h(0)∥≤ϕ(x, 0),
∥f(y) −g(0) −h(y)∥≤ϕ(0, y)
and by Eq. [5.10], we conclude that
∥f(x) −
	
g(x) −g(0)

∥≤ϕ(x, 0),
(5.11)
∥f(y) −
	
h(y) −h(0)

∥≤ϕ(0, y)
(5.12)
for all x, y ∈A.
Let x ∈A be ﬁxed. By (O4) there exists ux ∈A such that x ⊥ux, x + ux ⊥x −ux
and uαx = αux for all α ∈R. Hence,
∥f(x + ux) −g(x) −h(ux)∥≤ϕ(x, ux).
(5.13)
By (O3), x ⊥−ux,
∥f(x −ux) −g(x) −h(−ux)∥≤ϕ(x, −ux).
(5.14)
Replacing x and y by x + ux and x −ux in Eq. [5.3], we have
∥f(2x) −g(x + ux) −h(x −ux)∥≤ϕ(x + ux, x −ux).
(5.15)
Substituting x + ux for x in Eq. [5.11] and x −ux for y in Eq. [5.12], respectively, one
gets the inequalities
∥f(x + ux) −	g(x + ux) −g(0)
∥≤ϕ(x + ux, 0),
(5.16)
∥f(x −ux) −
	
h(x −ux) −h(0)

∥≤ϕ(0, x −ux).
(5.17)

116

Thus, the triangle inequality and inequalities (5.15)–(5.17) yield
∥f(2x) −f(x + ux) −f(x −ux)∥≤∥f(2x) −g(x + ux) −h(x −ux)∥
+ ∥f(x + ux) −	g(x + ux) −g(0)

∥
≤ϕ(x + ux, x −ux) + ϕ(x + ux, 0) + ϕ(0, x −ux).
(5.18)
It follows from Eqs. [5.3], (5.12), (5.13), (5.14), oddness of f and triangle inequality
that
∥2f(x) −f(x + ux) −f(x −ux)∥≤∥f(x + ux) −g(x) −h(ux)∥
+ ∥f(x −ux) −g(x) −h(−ux)∥+ 2∥f(x) −

≤ϕ(x, ux) + ϕ(x, −ux) + 2ϕ(x, 0) + ϕ(0, ux) + ϕ(0, −ux).
(5.19)
Now, combining Eqs. [5.18] and (5.19), we have
∥f(2x) −2f(x)∥≤ϕ(x + ux, x −ux) + ϕ(x + ux, 0) + ϕ(0, x −ux) + ϕ(x, ux)
+ ϕ(x, −ux) + 2ϕ(x, 0) + ϕ(0, ux) + ϕ(0, −ux).
(5.20)
Using Eqs. [5.7] and (5.8), we can reduce Eq. [5.20] to
 f(x) −1
2f(2x)
 ≤1
2ψ(2x, 2ux) ≤Lψ(x, ux),
that is, m( f, Tf) ≤L = L1 < ∞. Moreover, replacing x in Eq. [5.20] by x
2 implies the
appropriate inequality for j = −1
 f(x) −2f

 ≤ψ(x, ux),
that is, m( f, Tf) ≤1 = L0 < ∞. By Theorem 2.2.8, there exists a mapping d : A →B
which is the ﬁxed point of T and satisﬁes
d(x) = lim
n→∞
f(2njx)

,
since limn→∞m(Tnf, d) = 0. The mapping d is the unique ﬁxed point of T in the set
M = {e ∈E : m(f, e) < ∞}. Using Theorem 2.2.8, we get
m( f, d) ≤

1 −Lm(f, Tf),

which yields
∥f(x) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux).
Further, inequalities (5.11) and (5.12) imply that
∥g(x) −g(0) −d(x)∥≤∥f(x) −
	
g(x) −g(0)

∥+ ∥f(x) −d(x)∥

It follows from inequalities (5.11) and (5.12) that

(5.21)
Let x, y ∈A with x ⊥y. (O3) ensures 2njx ⊥2njy for all n ∈N and from Eqs. [5.3],
(3.148), and (5.21), we obtain
2−njf	2nj(x + y)

Therefore, from n →∞, one establishes d(x + y) −d(x) −d(y) = 0. Hence, d is
orthogonally additive.
In addition, we claim that the mapping d satisﬁes the functional equation (5.1).
Deﬁne r : A × A →B by r(x, y) = f(xy) −xg(y) −h(x)y for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y.
Condition (5.6) implies that

(5.23)
Set x = 0 in Eq. [5.23]. Since d(0) = 0 and 0 ⊥y for all y ∈A, we may conclude that
limn→∞h(0)
2nj y = 0. Hence,
d(xy) = xg(y) + d(x)y
(5.24)
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y.
Now, let x, y ∈A with x ⊥y and n ∈N be ﬁxed. Using Eq. [5.24] and orthogonal
additivity of d, one can easily show that
xg(2njy) + 2njd(x)y = xg(2njy) + d(x)2njy = d
	
x(2njy)

= d
	
(2njx)y

= 2njxg(y) + d(2njx)y = 2njxg(y) + 2njd(x)y.
If we compare the above relation with Eq. [5.24], we get
xg(2njy)
2nj
= xg(y)
(5.25)
and so
d(xy) = xg(2njy)
2nj
+ d(x)y.
Taking the limit as n →∞, we see that
d(xy) = xd(y) + lim
n→∞xg(0)
2nj + d(x)y.
(5.26)
Letting y = 0 in Eq. [5.26], we may infer that limn→∞x g(0)
2nj = 0. Therefore, d(xy) =
xd(y) + d(x)y. The proof of Theorem 5.2.2 is now completed.
In particular, given ϕ(x, y) = ε(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p) and φ(x, y) = θ∥x∥q∥y∥s for ε, θ ≥0
and some real numbers p, q, s in the main theorem, one gets the following corollary (as
a consequence of Rassias theorem).
Corollary 5.2.3 (Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78]). Let A be an orthogonality Banach
algebra and B a Banach A-bimodule. Let j ∈{−1, 1} and f, g, h : A →B be mappings

for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, ε, θ ≥0 and real numbers p, q, s such that p, q < 1 for
j = 1 and p, q > 1 for j = −1. If f is an odd mapping, then there exists a unique

for any ﬁxed x ∈A and some ux ∈A with x ⊥ux.
Proof. Let ϕ(x, y) = ε(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p) and φ(x, y) = θ∥x∥q∥y∥s. Clearly, ϕ(0, 0) =
φ(0, 0) = 0. It follows from the hypotheses of the corollary that

for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, that is, the conditions (3.148) and (5.6) in the Theorem 5.2.2
are sharp here. Since the inequality
2−jψ(2jx, 2jux) = 2j(p−1)ε	2∥x + ux∥p + 2∥x −ux∥p + 4∥x∥p + 4∥ux∥p
≤2j(p−1)ψ(x, ux)
holds for any ﬁxed x ∈A, some ux ∈A with x ⊥ux, ε ≥0 and real numbers p
such that p < 1 for j = 1 and p > 1 for j = −1, we see that inequality (5.8) in
Theorem 5.2.2 holds with L = 2j(p−1). Now, by Eq. [5.9], we conclude the assertion of
this corollary.
Next, we are going to establish the hyperstability of the orthogonal Pexider ring
derivation.
Corollary 5.2.4 (Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78]). Let A be an orthogonality Banach
algebra and B a Banach A-bimodule. Assume that f, g, h : A →B are mappings
satisfying the system

for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, where j ∈{−1, 1}. Let g(0) = h(0) = 0 and B be a Banach
A-bimodule without order, ie, Ax = 0 or xA = 0 implies that x = 0. If f is an odd
mapping, ϕ(0, 0) = φ(0, 0) = 0 and there exists 0 < L = L(j) < 1 such that for any
ﬁxed x ∈A and some ux ∈A with x ⊥ux, the mapping ψ (Eq. [5.7] in Theorem 5.2.2)
has the property

then the mappings g, h are orthogonally ring derivations. Moreover, if either ϕ(0, x) =
0 or ϕ(x, 0) = 0 for all x ∈A, then f is orthogonally ring derivation.
Proof. According to Theorem 5.2.2, there exists an orthogonally ring derivation

 = 0 for all x, y ∈A. Therefore, g = d.
Let x, y ∈A with x ⊥y and r be the mapping deﬁned in Theorem 5.2.2. It follows
from Eq. [5.28] that
lim
n→∞
r(x, 2njy)
2nj
= 0.
Using the above relation and Eq. [5.29], we obtain
d(xy) = xd(y) + h(x)y.
(5.30)
Similarly to the corresponding proof of Theorem 5.2.2, we have
h(2njx)
2nj
y = h(x)y.

By applying Eq. [5.29] in the previous relation, we conclude that h = d.
Now, we only need to show that f is orthogonally ring derivation. Applying the last
hypothesis of this corollary to either relation (5.11) or relation (5.12), we indeed get
the desired result.
Theorem 5.2.5 (Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78]). Let A be an orthogonality Banach
algebra and B a Banach A-bimodule. Suppose that f, g, h : A →B are mappings
satisfying the following system of functional inequalities
∥f(x + y) −g(x) −h(y)∥≤ϕ(x, y),
(5.31)
∥f(xy + yx) −xg(y) −h(x)y −yg(x) −h(y)x∥≤φ(x, y),
(5.32)
where ϕ, φ : A × A →[0, ∞) are mappings such that
lim
n→∞
ϕ(2njx, 2njy)
2nj
= 0,
lim
n→∞
φ(2njx, y)

= lim
n→∞
φ(x, 2njy)
2nj
= 0
(5.33)
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, where j ∈{−1, 1}. If f is an odd mapping, ϕ(0, 0) =
φ(0, 0) = 0 and there exists 0 < L = L(j) < 1 such that for any ﬁxed x ∈A and some
ux ∈A with x ⊥ux, the mapping ψ (Eq. [5.7] in Theorem 5.2.2) has the property
ψ(x, ux) ≤L2jψ( x
2j , ux
2j ),
then there exists a unique orthogonally Jordan ring derivation d : A →B such that
∥f(x) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux),
∥g(x) −g(0) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux) + ϕ(x, 0),
∥h(x) −h(0) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux) + ϕ(0, x).
Proof. Letting x, y = 0 in Eqs. [5.31] and (5.32), we get
f(0) = 0,
g(0) + h(0) = 0.
Applying the similar argument to the corresponding part of Theorem 5.2.2, we
conclude that there exists a unique orthogonally additive mapping d : A →B, which
is the ﬁxed point of T and satisﬁes

∥f(x) −d(x)∥≤L1+j/2
1 −L ψ(x, ux).
Moreover,

(5.34)
Now, we are going to show that the mapping d satisﬁes functional equation (5.2).
Deﬁne r : A × A →B by r(x, y) = f(xy + yx) −xg(y) −h(x)y −yg(x) −h(y)x for all
x, y ∈A with x ⊥y. It follows from Eq. [5.33] that
lim
n→∞
r(2njx, y)
2nj
= 0.
(5.35)
Making use of Eqs. [5.34] and (5.35), we get
d(xy + yx) = lim

(5.36)
Let x = 0 in Eq. [5.36]. Employing the orthogonal additivity of d and the fact that
0 ⊥y for all y ∈A, one proves that limn→∞

h(0)

= 0. Hence,
d(xy + yx) = xg(y) + d(x)y + yd(x) + h(y)x
(5.37)
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y.
Now let x, y ∈A with x ⊥y and n ∈N be ﬁxed. By Eq. [5.37] and orthogonal
additivity of d, it can be shown that
xg(2njy) + 2njd(x)y + 2njyd(x) + h(2njy)x
= xg(2njy) + d(x)2njy + 2njyd(x) + h(2njy)x

123
and then
xg(2njy)
2nj
+ h(2njy)
2nj
x = xg(y) + h(y)x.
Comparing the above relation with Eq. [5.37], we get
d(xy + yx) = xg(2njy)
2nj
+ d(x)y + yd(x) + h(2njy)

Sending n to inﬁnity, we obtain

Putting y = 0 in Eq. [5.38], one gets limn→∞x g(0)
2nj + limn→∞h(0)
2nj x = 0. Hence,
d(xy + yx) = xd(y) + d(x)y + yd(x) + d(y)x. This completes the proof of the theorem.
As a special case, if one takes ϕ(x, y) = ε(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p) and φ(x, y) = θ∥x∥q∥y∥s
for ε, θ ≥0 and some real numbers p, q, s in Theorem 5.2.5, then one has the following
corollary (as a consequence of Rassias theorem).
Corollary 5.2.6 (Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78]). Let A be an orthogonality Banach
algebra and B a Banach A-bimodule. Let f, g, h : A →B be mappings satisfying
∥f(x + y) −g(x) −h(y)∥≤ε(∥x∥p + ∥y∥p),
∥f(xy + yx) −xg(y) −h(x)y −yg(x) −h(y)x∥≤θ∥x∥q∥y∥s
for all x, y ∈A with x ⊥y, ε, θ ≥0 and real numbers p, q, s such that p, q < 1 for
j = 1 and p, q > 1 for j = −1. If f is an odd mapping, then there exists a unique
conditional Jordan ring derivation d : A →B such that Eq. [5.27] in Corollary 5.2.3
is sharp here for any ﬁxed x ∈A and some ux ∈A with x ⊥ux, where j ∈{−1, 1}.
Proof. The proof of this corollary is omitted as it is similar to the proof of
Corollary 5.2.3.
We now present the hyperstability result concerning the orthogonal Pexider Jordan
ring derivation. The proof is similar to that of Corollary 5.2.4 and we thus omit it.
Corollary 5.2.7 (Eshaghi and Abbaszadeh [78]). Let A be an orthogonality Banach
algebra and B a Banach A-bimodule. Assume that f, g, h : A →B are mappings
satisfying the system
∥f(x + y) −g(x) −h(y)∥≤ϕ(x, y),
∥f(xy + yx) −xg(y) −h(x)y −yg(x) −h(y)x∥≤φ(x, y),

A-bimodule without order, ie, Ax = 0 or xA = 0 implies that x = 0. If f is an odd
mapping, ϕ(0, 0) = φ(0, 0) = 0 and there exists 0 < L = L(j) < 1 such that for any
ﬁxed x ∈A and some ux ∈A with x ⊥ux, the mapping ψ (Eq. [5.7] in Theorem 5.2.2)
has the property

then the mappings g, h are orthogonally Jordan ring derivations. Moreover, if either
ϕ(0, x) = 0 or ϕ(x, 0) = 0 for all x ∈A, then f is orthogonally Jordan ring derivation.
5.3
Some open problems
Eshaghi et al. [84] introduced the notion of the orthogonal sets and gave a real
generalization of Banach’ ﬁxed point theorem.
Deﬁnition 5.3.1 (Eshaghi et al. [84]). Let X ̸= ∅and ⊥⊆X × X be an binary
relation. If ⊥satisﬁes the condition
∃x0; (∀y; y⊥x0)
or
(∀y; x0⊥y),
it is called an orthogonal set (brieﬂy O-set). We denote this O-set by (X, ⊥).
As an illustration, we consider the following examples.
Example 5.3.2 (Eshaghi et al. [84]). Let X be the set of all peoples in the world. We
deﬁne x⊥y if x can give blood to y. According to Table 5.1, if x0 is a person such that

his (or her) blood type is O−, then we have x0⊥y for all y ∈X. This means that (X, ⊥)
is an O-set. In this O-set, x0 (in deﬁnition) is not unique.
Note that in the above example, x0 may be a person with blood type AB+. In this
case, we have y⊥x0 for all y ∈X.
Deﬁnition 5.3.3 (Eshaghi et al. [84]). Let (X, ⊥) be O-set. A sequence {xn}n∈N is
called orthogonal sequence (brieﬂy O-sequence) if
(∀n; xn⊥xn+1)
or
(∀n; ∀xn+1⊥xn).
Deﬁnition 5.3.4 (Eshaghi et al. [84]). Let (X, ⊥, d) be an orthogonal metric space
((X, ⊥) is an O-set and (X, d) is a metric space). Then f : X →X is orthogonally
continuous (⊥-continuous) in a ∈X if for each O-sequence {an}n∈N in X if an →a,
then f(an) →f(a). Also f is ⊥-continuous on X if f is ⊥-continuous in each a ∈X.
Deﬁnition 5.3.5 (Eshaghi et al. [84]). Let (X, ⊥, d) be an orthogonal metric space
and 0 < λ < 1. A mapping f : X →X is said to be orthogonally contraction
(⊥-contraction) with Lipschitz constant λ if
d(fx, fy) ≤λd(x, y),
x⊥y.
It is easy to show that every contraction is ⊥-contraction, but the converse is not
true.
The following theorem is a real extension of Banach contraction principle.
Theorem 5.3.6 (Eshaghi et al. [84]). Let (X, ⊥, d) be an O-complete metric space
(not necessarily complete metric space) and 0 < λ < 1. Let f : X →X be
⊥-continuous, ⊥-contraction (with Lipschitz constant λ) and ⊥-preserving, then f has
a unique ﬁxed point x∗in X. Also, f is a Picard operator, that is, lim f n(x) = x∗for all
x ∈X.
We shall now present some problems concerning the new extension of Banach
contraction principle.
Problem 5.3.7. Theorem 5.3.6 is an extension of Theorem 2.2.8 with new deﬁnition
of orthogonality. It is now natural to expect a new extension of Theorem 2.2.8 based
on Theorem 5.3.6.
Problem 5.3.8. As we noted in Chapter 2, Radu [13] showed that the theorems of
Hyers, Rassias, and Gajda concerning the stability of Cauchy’s functional equation
in Banach spaces are direct consequences of the alternative of ﬁxed point (Theo-
rem 2.2.8). Are these theorems consequences of extension of Theorem 2.2.8 based
on Theorem 5.3.6?
Problem 5.3.9. Problem 5.3.8 can be stated for other kinds of functional equations
such as quadratic, cubic, etc., moreover, mixed types of functional equations, see
Chapter 3.

Amenability of groups
(semigroups) and the stability
of functional equations
6.1
Introduction
The original theorem of Hyers (Theorem 2.1.1) holds when the mapping involved is
deﬁned on an abelian group. This yields to the following question: is this fact indeed
essential? The answer is no. Székelyhidi [85] proved that the amenability of the group
is enough to ensure stability. Now another question naturally arises: what are the
connections between stability of homomorphisms and amenability of the group where
they are deﬁned? Forti [86] ﬁrst tried to give answers to these questions.
6.2
The stability of homomorphisms and amenability
We start this section with the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.2.1. [Forti [86]] Let G be a group (or a semigroup) and B a Banach
space. We say that the couple (G, B) has the property of the stability of homomor-
phisms (shortly (G, B) is HS) if for every function f : G →B such that
∥f(xy) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤K
for every x, y ∈G and for some K, there exist φ ∈Hom(G, B) and K′ depending only
on K such that
∥f(x) −φ(x)∥≤K′
(6.1)
for all x ∈G.
A glance at the proof of theorem of Hyers (Theorem 2.1.1) shows that it remains
true if the Banach space E is substituted by an arbitrary abelian group or semigroup;
so we can say that for all Banach spaces B and all abelian groups (or semigroups),
G the couple (G, B) is HS. From Theorem 2.1.1 we easily get the following result.
Proposition 6.2.2. [Forti [86]] Let G be an arbitrary group (or semigroup) and let
B be a Banach space. Assume that f : G →B satisﬁes the inequality
∥f(xy) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤K

for every x, y ∈G. Then the limit limn→∞2−nf x2n exists for all x ∈G and

and
g

x2
= 2g(x)
(6.2)
for all x ∈G. The function g is the unique satisfying conditions (5.3).
Proof. The existence of the limit and the ﬁrst of Eq. [5.3] are contained in the
ﬁrst part of the proof of Hyers’ theorem. The second of Eq. [5.3] is an immediate
consequence of the deﬁnition of g. Let now h : G →B satisfying conditions (5.3),
then

dividing by 2n and letting n →∞we have g(x) = h(x).
Proposition 6.2.2 shows that the existence of the limit limn→∞2−nf

x2n
depends
only on the completeness of the space B. Whether the function g is additive or not
depends on the group G. These simple remarks enable us to prove the following
theorem.
Theorem 6.2.3. [Forti [86]] Let the couple (G, B) be HS, then the smallest constant
K′ fulﬁlling inequality (5.3) is equal to K; moreover, the homomorphism φ satisfying
Eq. [5.1] is unique.
Proof. Let g be the function deﬁned as in Proposition 6.2.2, it fulﬁlls the conditions
(5.3). Since (G, B) is HS, there exists φ ∈Hom(G, B) such that
∥f(x) −φ(x)∥≤K′
for all x ∈G. So
∥f

x2n
−φ

x2n
∥= ∥f

x2n
−2nφ (x) ∥≤K′.
Dividing by 2n and taking the limit as n →∞, we have g(x) = φ(x), thus if K′ is
the smallest constant fulﬁlling Eq. [5.1], we get K′ < K. On the other hand, if we take
f(x) = φ(x) + c, where φ ∈Hom(G, B) and ∥c∥= K, we get
∥f(xy) −f(x) −f(y)∥∥c∥= K
and
∥f(x) −φ(x)∥= K,
whence the smallest constant fulﬁlling Eq. [5.1] must be K. The uniqueness of
φ follows from Proposition 6.2.2.
Corollary 6.2.4. [Forti [86]] If G is a ﬁnite group (or semigroup), then (G, B) is
HS for every Banach space B, and φ = 0.

Amenability of groups (semigroups) and the stability of functional equations
129
Theorem 6.2.5. [Forti [86]] Assume that the couple (G, C) or (G, R) is HS. Then
for every complex or real Banach space B, the couple (G, B) is HS.
Proof. Let f : G →B be such that
∥f(xy) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤K
for all x, y ∈G. If B′ is the (topological) dual of B, for every L ∈B′ we have
|L{f(xy) −f(x) −f(y)}| = |L{f(xy)} −L{f(x)} −L{f(y)}| ≤K∥L∥.
Thus there exists φL ∈Hom(G, C) such that
|L{f(x) −φL(x)}| ≤K∥L∥.
Deﬁne φ(x) = limn→∞2−nf

x2n
(the limit exists by Proposition 6.2.2); we have

= L(φ(x)), by the continuity of L. So
L

φ(xy)

= φL(x) + φL(y) = L(φ(x)) + L

φ(y)

for every L ∈B′. Hence, φ(xy) = φ(x) + φ(y). By Proposition 6.2.2, we have that
(G, B) is HS.
From now on in this section, we assume that the couple (G, B) (G group or
semigroup) be HS, and if f is a function from G into B, by Lf(x, y) we denote the
Cauchy difference Lf(x, y) = f(xy) −f(x) −f(y). If Lf(x, y) is bounded, by φf we
intend the homomorphism approximating f as indicated in Deﬁnition 6.2.1.
We consider the relations between the range of Lf (when bounded) and the range of
f −φf . The results achieved will be used to solve some alternative functional equations.
Deﬁnition 6.2.6. [Forti [86]] Let M be an arbitrary subset of a real or complex
vector space. By C(M) we denote the convex hull of M, that is, the set of all elements
of the form n
i=1 αixi, αi ≥0, n
i=1 αi = 1, xi ∈M.
The following useful theorem is a straightforward generalization (with its proof) of
Theorem 2 in [87].
Theorem 6.2.7 (Forti [86]). Assume that Lf(x, y) ∈M, where M is a bounded
subset of a Banach space B. Then h(x) ∈C(−M), where h = f −φf . (By ¯A we intend
the closure of A).
Proof. Let x ∈G and u = h(x). Then for every positive integer s we have
h xs = su +
s−1

i=1
mi,
mi ∈M.
(6.3)
This can be proved by induction over s. Dividing Eq. [6.3] by s and taking the limit as
s →∞, we have

u = −lim
s→∞s−1
s−1

i=1
mi
(the limit exists since h is bounded), hence, u ∈C(M).
As a consequence of Theorem 6.2.7, the range of f −φf is contained in the closed
subspace of B spanned by M. A result of this kind, under different assumptions, has
been obtained by Baron [88].
Theorem 6.2.8 (Baron [88]). Let G be an abelian group, Y a vector space over
Q and Z an arbitrary subspace of Y. A function f : G →Y satisﬁes the condition
f(x1 + x2) −f(x1) −f(x2) ∈Z
for all x1, x2 ∈G, if and only if there exists an additive function g : G →Y such that
f(x) −g(x) ∈Z for every x ∈G.
It has to be noticed that the additive function g in Baron’s theorem is not uniquely
determined. The following theorem gives a stronger result than Theorem 6.2.7 and it
will be used in order to solve some functional equations.
Theorem 6.2.9 (Forti [86]). Assume that Lf(x, y) ∈M (x, y ∈G) where M is a
bounded subset of B and let h = f −φf . If ε is the identity of G, let −h(ε) = m0 ∈M.
Then h(x) ∈{−(m0 + M) + C(M)}  C(−M).
Proof. Since h(ε) −h(x) −h

x−l
∈M and −h(ε) = m0 ∈M, we have, for
some m ∈M, h(x) = −h x−l −m0 −m, hence h(x) ∈−h x−l −(m0 + M).
By Theorem 6.2.7, −h

x−l
∈C(M) and h(x) ∈C(−M); thus we get the desired
result.
Now, we intend to analyze for which groups G the couple (G, B) is HS. We have
already remarked that, as a consequence of Hyers’ theorem and of Corollary 6.2.4, the
couple (G, B) is HS for all abelian and all ﬁnite groups (or semigroups), whatever the
Banach space B is.
Deﬁnition 6.2.10 (Forti [86]). Let G be a group or a semigroup and B(G) be the
space of all bounded complex-valued functions on G, equipped with the supremum
norm ∥f∥∞. A linear functional m on B(G) is a left invariant mean (LIM) if
(α) m(¯f) = m(f), f ∈B(G);
(β) inf{f(x)} ≤m(f) ≤sup{f(x)} for all real-valued f ∈B(G); and
(γ ) m(xf) = m(f) for all x ∈G and f ∈B(G), where xf(t) = f(xt).
Likewise, we say m is a right invariant mean if m(fx) = m(f) for all x ∈G, where
fx(t) = f(tx), and we deﬁne two-sided invariance in the usual way. Condition (β) is
equivalent to m(f) ≥0 if f ≥0, and m(1) = 1, hence ∥m∥= 1 for every mean.
The following two propositions hold (see [89]):
Proposition 6.2.11. If G is a semigroup with a LIM and a right invariant mean on
B(G), then there exists a two-sided invariant mean on B(G).

Amenability of groups (semigroups) and the stability of functional equations
131
Proposition 6.2.12. If G is a group, there is a LIM on B(G) if and only if there is
a right invariant mean on B(G). Hence, by Proposition 6.2.11, there is a two-sided
invariant mean on B(G).
Deﬁnition 6.2.13. A semigroup G is left (right) amenable if there is a left (right)
invariant mean on B(G); if G is a group, these conditions are the same and we say that
G is amenable.
The following theorem due to Székelyhidi [85] shows that amenability implies the
stability of homomorphisms. A direct proof is given in [86].
Theorem 6.2.14. Let G be a left (right) amenable semigroup, then (G, C) is HS.
Proof. Let f : G →C be such that
∥f(xy) −f(x) −f(y)∥≤K
for all x, y ∈G; then, for each ﬁxed x ∈G, the function f(xy) −f(y), as a function of
y, is in B(G). Let my be a LIM on B(G) (the sufﬁx y denotes that my acts on functions
of the variable y) and deﬁne
φ(x) = my{xf −f}
for all x ∈G. We have
φ(xz) = my{xzf −f} = my{xzf −x f +x f −f} = my{x(zf −f)} + my{xf −f}
= my{zf −f} + φ(x) = φ(z) + φ(x).
So φ ∈Hom(G, C). Then
|φ(x) −f(x)| = |my{xf −f} −f(x)| = |my{xf −f −f(x)}|
≤supy∈G|f(xy) −f(x) −f(y)| ≤K
for all x ∈G and thus (G, C) is HS.
Corollary 6.2.15. Let G be a left (right) amenable semigroup, then for all Banach
spaces B, (G, B) is HS.
Now a question arises naturally: are there groups or semigroups G such that (G, B)
is not HS for some B? In view of Theorem 6.2.14, we must look among non-amenable
groups or semigroups. The following theorem (presented by G.L. Forti to the 22nd
International Symposium on Functional Equations) gives an answer.
Theorem 6.2.16. Let F(a, b)

S(a, b)

be the free group (semigroup) generated by
the elements a and b. The couple (F(a, b), R)

(S(a, b), R)

is not HS.
Proof. We shall construct a function f : F(a, b) →R such that |Lf(x, y)| ≤1
and for every φ ∈Hom(F(a, b), R) the difference f −φ is unbounded. To do this, if
x ∈F(a, b), we assume that the “word” x be reduced, that is it does not contain pairs
of the forms aa−1, a−1a, bb−1, b−1b and it is written without exponents different from
1 and −1. We now deﬁne a function f : F(a, b) →R in the following way: if r(x) is
the number of pairs of the form ab contained in x and s(x) is the number of pairs of the
form b−1a−1 contained in x, then f(x) = r(x) −s(x).

132
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
The function f is unbounded and for each x, y ∈F(a, b) we have f(xy)−f(x)−f(y) ∈
{−1, 0, 1}, so |Lf(x, y)| ≤1.
Assume now that φ ∈Hom(F(a, b), R) exists so that f −φ is bounded. φ is
completely determined by the values φ(a) and φ(b) and f is identically zero on the
subgroups generated by a and b, respectively. Hence the boundedness of f −φ on these
two subgroups implies φ = 0; thus f −φ = f, a contradiction since f is unbounded.
If instead of the free group F(a, b) we consider the free semigroup S(a, b), we get
the analogous result by deﬁning f(x) = r(x).
Theorems 6.2.14 and 6.2.16 suggest studying the connections between the stability
of homomorphisms and the amenability of groups or semigroups. In fact, G.L. Forti
obtained a theorem giving a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the amenability in
terms of a kind of multi-stability.
We denote with Br(G) the space of all bounded real-valued functions on G and with
BrL(G) the space of all real-valued functions f on G for which Lf is bounded on G×G.
Theorem 6.2.17 (Forti [86]). Let G be a group. G is amenable if and only if for
every n-tuple f1, f2, . . . , fn ∈BrL(G), there exist φ1, φ2, . . . , φn ∈Hom(G, R), such
that fi −φi ∈Br(G) and for all n-tuples x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈G, the inequality
H(x1, x2, . . ., xn) ≤
n

i=1
{φi(x1) −fi(xi)} ≤K(x1, x2, . . ., xn)
(6.4)
holds, where
H(x1, x2, . . ., xn) = infy∈G
n

i=1
Lfi(x1, y),
K(x1, x2, . . ., xn) = supy∈G
n

i=1
Lfi(xi, y).
Proof. Assume that G is amenable and let my be a LIM on B(G). If fi ∈BrL(G) we
put φi(x) = my{xfi −fi} for all x ∈G. By Theorem 6.2.14, we have φi ∈Hom(G, R)
and fi −φi ∈Br(G). Fix now x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈G, by (β) of Deﬁnition 6.2.10 we have
inf

hence, from the deﬁnition of φi and of fi we get

Amenability of groups (semigroups) and the stability of functional equations

Thus we get inequality (5.11).
Conversely, let f1, f2, . . . , fn
∈
Br(G), then f1, f2, . . . , fn
∈
BrL(G) and the
corresponding homomorphisms (existing by hypothesis) φi are equal to zero. We now
show that inequality (5.11) implies the condition of Dixmier (see [89]). We must show
that
supy∈G

Assuming that the supremum in Eq. [6.5] be equal to −ε < 0, then

hence, by Eq. [5.11] (the φis are zero) we get

a contradiction.

Some open problems
Problem 6.3.1. It is well known that a group containing F(a, b) as a subgroup is
not amenable. Hence a question arises: can Theorem 6.2.16 be extended to groups
containing F(a, b)? This can be formulated in the following way: let G ⊃F(a, b) and
let f : F(a, b) →R be deﬁned as in Theorem 6.2.16. Is it possible to extend f to
˜f : G →R such that |L˜f (x, y)| ≤K for all x, y ∈G?
Problem 6.3.2. Let S be a semigroup and B a Banach space. We say that the couple
(S, B) has the property of the stability of Jensen functional equation (shortly (S, B) is
JS) if for every function f : S →B such that
∥2f(xy) −f(x2) −f(y2)∥≤δ
for all x, y ∈S and for some ﬁnite δ ≥0, there exists a Jensen function J : S →B such
that
∥f(x) −J(x)∥≤´δ
for all x ∈S, where ﬁnite constant ´δ ≥0 depends only on δ.
Let S be an Abelian semigroup and B be a Banach space. If f : S →B satisﬁes
∥2f(xy) −f(x2) −f(y2)∥≤δ

134
Theory of Approximate Functional Equations
for some ﬁnite δ ≥0 and for all x, y ∈S, is there a Jensen function J : S →B such that
∥f(x) −J(x)∥≤´δ
for all x ∈S, where the ﬁnite constant ´δ ≥0 depends only on δ?
Problem 6.3.3. Assume that S is an left (right) amenable 2-divisible semigroup and
assume that f : S →C is a mapping satisfying
|2f(xy) −f(x2) −f(y2)| ≤ε
for ε ≥0 and for all x, y ∈S, where C is the set of all complex numbers. Is there a
Jensen function ϕ : S →C such that
|ϕ(a) −f(a)| ≤2ϵ
for all a ∈S?
Problem 6.3.4. The equation
φ(xyz) + φ(x) + φ(y) + φ(z) = φ(xy) + φ(yz) + φ(xz)
is called the Deeba functional equation. Let S be a semigroup and X a Banach space.
Assume that S is a left amenable semigroup and assume that f : S →C is a mapping
satisfying
|f(xyz) + f(x) + f(y) + f(z) −f(xy) −f(xz) −f(yz)| ≤δ
for δ ≥0 and for all x, y ∈S. Is there a Deeba function ϕ : S →C such that
|ϕ(x) −f(x)| ≤δ
for all x ∈S?
Problem 6.3.5. Let S be a semigroup. A mapping ϕ : S →C is called multiplicative
if ϕ(xy) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y). We remark that ϕ is a nonzero function because if there exist
t ∈S such that ϕ(t) = 0, then we have ϕ(te) = ϕ(t)ϕ(e) = 0 and
ϕ(z) = ϕ(ze) = ϕ(zt−1t) = ϕ(zt−1)ϕ(t) = 0
for all z ∈S. This implies that ϕ = 0.
Assume that S is an extremely left amenable semigroup and assume that f : S →C
is a mapping satisfying
|f(xy) −f(x)f(y)| ≤ε min{|f(x)|, |f(y)|}

Amenability of groups (semigroups) and the stability of functional equations
135
for ε ≥0 and for all x, y ∈S. Is there a homomorphism ϕ : S →C such that
|ϕ(x) −f(x)| ≤ε
for all x ∈S?
Problem 6.3.6. Let S be an extremely left amenable semigroup and A be a
C∗-algebra. Let f : S →A be a mapping satisfying
∥f(xy) −f(x)f(y)∥≤ε min{∥f(x)∥, ∥f(y)∥}
for ε ≥0 and for all x, y ∈S, where f(x) is positive for all x ∈S. Is there a
multiplicative function φ : S →A such that
∥φ(x) −f(x)∥≤ϵ
for all x ∈S?
